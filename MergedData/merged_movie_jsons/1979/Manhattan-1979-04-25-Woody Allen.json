            "content": "After the phenomenal success of 'Annie Hall,' the hilarious Oscar-winning comedy detailing the romantic exploits of neurotic Jewish comedian Alvey Singer, Woody Allen had become of America's most respected filmmakers. In 1979, he released what is generally accepted as his second great masterpiece, 'Manhattan,' a poignant tribute to the city that Allen loves so dearly. Written by Allen and his 'Annie Hall'-collaborator Marshall Brickman, 'Manhattan' stars Allen as Isaac Davis, a twice-divorced, 42-year-old comedy writer who is intimately involved with a 17-year-old high school student, Tracy (an Oscar-nominated Mariel Hemingway). Meanwhile, Isaac begins to fall for Mary (Diane Keaton), who is the secret mistress of his best friend (Michael Murphy). Adding to all of Isaac's troubles, his former second wife, Jill (Meryl Streep), who had originally left him for another woman, has plans to write a tell-all book on their failed marriage.If this all seems very confusing to you, then you're not alone. Just as in 'Annie Hall,' Allen plays the hopeless romantic who is struggling desperately to understand the maddening complexity of human relationships. Though Tracy is only seventeen years old, she is arguably the most honest and mature of the women in Isaac's life; nonetheless, he doesn't treat her seriously. In his mind, anything that she says is quite obviously influenced by the naivety and downright ignorance of the young. Their relationship was never meant to be anything more than a brief \"fling,\" and so he feels no guilt for seeing another woman behind his back, an act that makes him livid when it ultimately happens to him.'Manhattan' was shot in beautiful crisp black-and-white by Gordon Willis, who has also worked on, among countless other films, 'Annie Hall' and the three installments of 'The Godfather.' The cinematography offers New York City a romantic 1940s feel, reminiscent of how Allen claims to remember the city as a child: \"Maybe it's a reminiscence from old photographs, films, books and all that. But that's how I remember New York. I always heard Gershwin music with it, too. In 'Manhattan' I really think that we \u0097 that's me and cinematographer Gordon Willis \u0097 succeeded in showing the city. When you see it there on that big screen it's really decadent.\"Mysteriously, this film remains the least-liked by the director himself, though, at the same time, it was also his most commercially successful. As you've no doubt already noticed from this review, 'Manhattan' is often likened to 1977's 'Annie Hall,' perhaps due to the repeated casting of Allen and Keaton (a not uncommon occurrence) or its similar attempt to uncover the elusive secrets behind love and relationships. In terms of film-making style, however, the films are quite dissimilar. Unlike the highly-energetic 'Annie Hall' \u0096 which cut back and forward in time, visited old memories, broke the fourth wall and made conversations with passing extras \u0096 'Manhattan' boasts a more classical approach \u0096 quiet, softly-spoken and accompanied by a wistfully slow jazzy soundtrack, also relying heavily on the works of George Gershwin.",

            "content": "Woody Allen once said that, whereas Scorsese had generated a host of imitators, he had generated none. This may be true; films like Manhattan certainly come along far too infrequently.That this is such a gorgeous film may strike those following the formulaic, Hollywood approach to cinema as strange and heretical. The story is unexciting (restless male in love triangle), most of the characters are unsympathetic, at least on the surface (particularly Isaac), Allen leaves lose ends lying around all over the place, and there's certainly no action (unless you count the car-chase-without-a-chase-scene involving Diane Keaton, Woody Allen and a VW Beetle).So why should any self-respecting member of the MTV generation spend time on this film? Well, here are a few reasons.The script is wit of the highest order. This is not gag-a-minute humour like Friends, but an altogether more acute art form stemming from character, some wonderful dialogue and a fair amount of darkness (I love the bit about Isaac trying to run over his ex-wife's lover). Allen is also prepared to turn his biting satire to personal issues, such as being Jewish. Just don't expect someone to look shrug their shoulders, slap their forehead and with mid-rising intonation say d'uh! It's not that kind of comedy.Then there is the gorgeous cinematography. Woody loves Manhattan and you can certainly tell. If there is one criticism of the film, it is that it leaves a rather picture postcard impression of the city, but I suppose if it's love, then it's love. Much of the film appears to have been shot at either sunrise or sunset to soften the light, and there are spectacular views of the towers, bridges and waterways of America's finest metropolis.Then, I suppose, there is the fact that Manhattan is probably the archetypal Woody Allen film. Other films may be better, like Annie Hall or Hannah and Her Sisters but, in Manhattan, all the elements of Allen's style are in perfect balance. There's the jazz, the neurotic, unsympathetic lead, the choice between stable and highly-strung women, the self-mocking humour (hilariously done in the opening voice-over), the railing against intellectual snobbery, the deep unease with popular culture.And there are great performances. Allen is at his most difficult \u0096 and in some ways his least likable. As Isaac, he's trying to do the right thing, but is rarely selfless enough to follow through with it. Diane Keaton is great as Mary, the lynchpin between the two love triangles \u0096 vain, pretentious and yet you can see why Isaac falls for her. Well, all the actors are great, and very believable, but special mention must go to Meryl Streep, who manages to steal the show with her tiny cameo as Isaac's ex-wife, writing a book about their break-up and living with their son and her lover. She is magnificent.Of course, the film will also do nothing to dispel the popular rumour that New Yorkers are neurotic, self-obsessed and self-indulgent \u0096 at least that narrow social circle Allen so often writes about. If you don't mind that, though (and I'm English, so what do I care) you're in for a treat. As with the city itself, the memories of this film will stay with you forever.",

Watching it through, I rarely smiled, let alone laughed and had zero interest in the Jewish (pseudo-) intellectual (g)literati portrayed or their tangled love lives.I will also break cover and say that I found the insertion of a romance between a 42 year old male and a 17 year old girl fresh out of high - school spurious to say the least. Allen writes his usual \"good to be Woody\" part in bedding the afore-mentioned Mariel Hemingway and the grossly overrated Diane Keaton, cramming far too many words into the screenplay to the extent that I was willing the next George Gershwin composition onto the screen to distract my attention.In fact only Gershwin's sublime music and Gordon Willis' justly venerated cinematography impart any relief from the tedium in this very boring navel-gazing exercise in psychobabble which says precisely nothing about the human condition, at least to me.Unfunnily serious or seriously unfunny, either works for me...",

            "content": "Woody Allen has been churning out mediocre films for so long now that it's easy to forget how good some of his older films were. \"Manhattan\" is the product of Allen's \"mature\" 1970s phase, the phase that also produced \"Annie Hall\" and \"Interiors,\" and it's a wonderful film. It's not the plot that makes it singular -- it's typical upper-crust New York Allen, full of neurotic people in therapy cheating on one another and making mistake after mistake in their pursuit of what they think will make them happy. No, what makes \"Manhattan\" so effective is its style. Filmed in black and white (because, as Allen's character says in an opening voice over, New York is a city that has always and will always exist in black and white), the film is a love letter to NYC, and it suggests that the neuroses that fill its denizens are as much a part of the city's character as its architecture, culture and diversity. I would instantly be annoyed by the people that populate Allen's films if I met them in any other context. As it is, I can't imagine any Allen film (at least not one set in New York) without them.Grade: A",

            "review_title": "Rhapsody in NYC",
            "content": "Manhattan is an exhilarating American romance set against the backdrop of New York of the late 70's: my favorite New York, the New York of painters, poets, punks, and Pauline Kael.  Three great, very American talents -- Woody Allen, Gordon Willis, and George Gershwin -- intertwine their respective gifts to create a comedy that manages to satisfy both the brain and the heart, and even, perhaps, the lower regions.Allen is so brainy and such a nebbish that he can get away with gestures that would be painfully sentimental in the hands of any other director: when he begins the movie with fireworks cut to Gershwin, it isn't to soften you up for a soap opera, but to remind you that however much his neuroses may seem to drive the scenes, its the love of New York that drives the movie.The entire cast is note perfect: Meryl Streep as his caustic bisexual ex-wife, Diane Keaton as a nervous journalist from Philadelphia, and especially Mariel Hemingway, whose performance as Allen's 17-year old girlfriend is charming, heartbreaking, and wise.Allen's comedy here is at its absolute finest.  The fact that it is interwoven with a genuinely moving love story told with a subtlety and indirection that is unheard of in today's mainstream cinema only makes the laughs that much richer.Gordon Willis' cinematography is good enough for the Museum of Modern Art. Scene after scene leaves a grin on your face as his moving (in both senses) black and white photography floats across the screen.And finally underlying everything is the music of George Gershwin, whose exubertant melodies propel the movie forward at every turn.This is Woody Allen's best movie, a great movie, and an American movie in the best sense.  As an homage to the city of New York it will surely remain unsurpassed.",

            "content": "Woody Allen started off making outrageous, cheap, hit-and-miss, unpretentious comedies, the best of which were probably \"Love and Death\" and \"Sleeper.\"  The comedy became more rooted in reality and grafted onto an engaging story of lost love in \"Annie Hall,\" which I think is still his best film.  After that, \"Interiors.\"  Ka-Boom.  Since then there have been no more absurd comedies, several gloomy dramas, and many more or less successful attempts to blend comedy with serious themes.This is one of the dark comedies and didn't work for me.  Allen is going with a high-school girl, falls for a woman nearer his own age, alienates his close friend, and finally decides -- too late -- that the younger girl is his soul mate.  It ends ambiguously with her leaving for Europe.  The plot is out of a soap opera.  It does have some witty lines (almost all of them given to Allen himself) and a lot of inside New Yorker intellectual allusions, but, aside from the Gershwin score, isn't worth seeing twice. Really, it's pretty boring.  The performances aren't bad, but Allen doesn't challenge himself either.  It's his old neurotic, stuttering, put-upon persona that is by now more than familiar enough.  There's just nothing new.It isn't that Allen had run out of ideas by 1979 because he's made some successful films since then -- \"Hollywood Ending\" and \"Broadway Danny Rose\", for instance.  But \"Manhattan\" is one of the many that simply got by me.  It didn't seem charming.  It seemed repetitious and pointless.  I didn't bother counting the times someone meets another and says, \"Hiii,\" using the contours of the fourth tone in Mandarin Chinese.  And no one seems to say it just once during a given encounter, but several times.  \"Hii, hii -- how AHH you?\"I kept waiting for one of two things to happen.  Either IT takes off or I get drawn in.  But neither contingency was realized.  I cared about the entanglements in \"Annie Hall,\" but here it didn't matter to me who wound up with whom, and I never got the feeling that it mattered much to Allen either.",

            "content": "I used to hold this film as somewhat of a sacred cow when I first saw it in 1979. I was a proscribed Woody fan andalthough I still like a few of his movies, this is no longer one of them, on recent review.I recently purchased copies of Manhattan and Annie Hall.I watched the latter first and it charmed my socks off again. One classic scene after another signals the height of Allen's art in this hilarious masterwork. Manhattan is a different story.Perhaps my recent viewing of Wild Man Blues has hippedme to what an whining, pampered egomaniac Mr. Allen is.Perhaps it's the irony of his Chaplin-like dalliances with young women that have set me against him. But I now watch Manhattanand see a pathetic, overblown Allen literally feeding lines to hisfellow actors to give him some smarmy comeback that never fails to show how intellectually superior he is. Different from Annie Hall, Allen is no longer the underdog but an ugly, obnoxiousover-lord...His characters in Manhattan, are cardboard. They are not real andthe situations are not real. I have no feeling for anyone in thismovie, except Woody, who I  feel contempt for, given his massiveand unfunny self-indulgence. It's pathetic to see Allen set upHemingway with lines that a teenager would never say in a millionyears, just to trump up his flaccid ego. Everyone in this movie actually feeds him lines to trump up his ego.Like Stardust Memories, this one shows Woody at his self- indulgent worst. This movie looks wonderful and sounds wonderful with the Gershwin score, but on further review, thisone's hollow and ultimately a maddening tribute to an egomaniac.",

            "content": "Woody Allen is not for everybody and he is not the most consistent of directors, being hit-and-miss since Husbands and Wives(personal opinion that is). His best work to me spanned from late 70s to early/mid 90s, and Manhattan is a fine example of Allen at his best. Visually it is one of Allen's most technically accomplished and beautiful films, the cinematography is so fluid and Manhattan has to have one of the best depictions of New York on film. George Gershwin's music fits perfectly, whether upbeat, seductive or melancholic. How it meshed with the imagery and cinematography further added to the poignancy. The screenplay is one of the best of any Woody Allen film(personal vote for best is Annie Hall, one of the greatest scripts ever), one of his wittiest, most acerbic- the opening voice-over stands out- yet also perhaps his most emotionally investing. The trademark self-mockery and sharp observations are all here, and you could go as far to say that Manhattan is also one of Allen's most truthful, a lot of what is picked upon is true and come across so bluntly that it's painful which makes it all affecting. The story is paced deliberately but the telling of it is very compelling, with its fair share of hilarious and touching moments. If there was a list of Woody Allen films that merged comedy and drama the most effectively, Manhattan would definitely be on the list and towards the top. The characters are very human and handled gracefully rather than being boorish. They are not likable by all means, but considering Allen's tendency to make fun of things and people and to funny and honest effect it's clear that Allen wasn't intending them to be likable. The performances are top-notch, Allen admittedly works better in the comedic moments but he's still great, it is fun to see Meryl Streep in an early role and Michael Murphy and Anne Byrne are fine in support roles. Mariel Hemingway's vulnerability helps you relate to her without manipulating you to do so, but the best performance comes from Diane Keaton, at home in both comedy and drama she is wonderful throughout. All in all, a Woody Allen masterpiece, and don't let the 17/42-age relationship distract you too much as it is handled much more tastefully than it could easily have done. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The film's script is so huge as to approach infinity. Allen drones on and on and on and on about nothing in particular. Occasionally, the script conveys some tepid humor, but mostly it is just tedious.Ostensibly, \"Manhattan\" is a tribute to NYC. But, since the film was written and directed by Woody Allen, and since the plot revolves around Allen's character, my impression is that the film was meant more as Woody Allen's tribute to himself.In a major support role, Diane Keaton is good. And, at times, the B&W photography is engaging. However, more often than not, especially in interior shots, the camera just sits there, while actors parade in front of it. The Gershwin music was nice, but I could have wished for more of it, to help pass the time while watching a diffident Allen mouth his nearly limitless lines.",

However, this doesn't seem to worry most people who have seen the film and thoroughly enjoyed it. The boys seem to feel that if Woody Allen can make it with the girls, there's hope for them too, and the girls seem to argue that Woody is such a mental giant and such a celebrity it would be an honor to be seen in his company!Once you accept the romantic scenes as perfectly natural and even desirable, and once you accept the Woody Allen character as the sympathetic hero he obviously wants you to accept him as, then the whole film falls into place and you laugh at all the jokes and you become emotionally involved in all the situations and you identify with the hero in his battles against the other characters and against the city itself. Identification completed, the Gershwin music, the skilfully framed, large screen, black and white photography, and the playing by all the other members of the cast (particularly Michael Murphy, Diane Keaton, Meryl Streep and Mariel Hemingway) is then meshed by writer/director Allen into a very satisfying and entertaining whole.

The female-roles in \"Manhattan\" for Diane Keaton, Mariel Hemingway, Anne Byrne and Meryl Streep are fabulous, and each actress does wonderful work (Byrne was Dustin Hoffman's wife at the time, and I've never seen her act since, which is a pity). The male characters are Woody and Michael Murphy (with kudos to Wallace Shawn) and Allen in particular crafts his individual scenes with each woman in a fresh and nuanced way (he's much different on a date with 17-year-old Hemingway than matching wits all night with neurotic genius Keaton). The film has lovely b&w photography by Gordon Willis, sumptuous scoring from the Gershwin songbook and some very funny lines. If it fails to shake off its own mortal coils by the final act, at least it leaves us with a sweet farewell. Allen does a lot of waffling in his character's final assessment, and I'm not really sure where his character would go after the story's close.

When he gets into the story of the film, his character, Isaac, is similar to other characters he has played, but Allen focuses on questions about relationships that resonate with others.Isaac is surrounded by other relationships-and piece of relationships-in disarray. Marriage and divorce try to arrange feelings neatly, to institutionalize them, but reality is not so orderly. In this film, no one asks how someone can have feelings for more than one person at a time, because this is a film about reality, not about cinematic conventions or fairy tale conceptions of romance.Isaac is dating a much younger woman named Tracy (Mariel Hemingway) who makes him feel safe because he knows it can never, really, go anywhere. He keeps her at arm's length, emotionally, and never allows himself to think of commitment. He eventually second guesses this strategy, because he always wants what he cannot have-which is more than he currently has.The ending is perfect, whether you read it as noncommittal or as a statement by Tracy. Her lack of experience means that we can never really know if her love is significant or merely of the moment. In a way, that makes her perfect for Isaac who, despite all his experience, is similarly inscrutable.This story feels right being set in the city. And the sophisticated conversations about art and philosophy that one expects in an urban setting perfectly ensconce the dialogue about relationships. When Mary (Diane Keaton) gives her vapid opinions of art works, so couched in pseudo-intellectual artspeak, we perceive them the way we perceive their pseudo-psychological conversations\nabout relationships.

            "content": "Based on my conversations there seem to be only two reactions possible to Woody Allen: some love him and think he's a genius, others hate him and think he's a fraud. If you fall into the former group, you'll love this movie. If, on the other hand, you belong to the latter group (I confess that I do) you'll think this movie is a sham.Perhaps I don't have a deep enough understanding of the technical and more sublime aspects of film-making. I do, however think that I know a good movie when I see one. This just doesn't qualify as one for me. I found little enjoyable in this tale of a neurotic, secularized New York Jew who is in love (and having sexual relations) with an underage girl. (Gee, hard to picture Woody in that kind of role, isn't it? He must have had to really extend his acting ability to pull this off!) As an actor, I think Woody has a very limited talent. As a director, almost everyone agrees that Woody has a rather quirky style. Most seem to use that word to mean charming, I suppose. But I simply find him irritating. As with other Woody movies I've seen, \"Manhattan\" features a silly storyline, bad humour and strange directorial decisions (like filming in black and white.) So, was there anything in this movie that I liked?I must confess that I admire Woody for his ability to be self-deprecating. He's obviously in many ways poking fun at himself in this. Neurotic, narcissistic, self-absorbed. These are words that get used to describe Isaac (his character) and they apply full-well to Allen. The best line of the movie surely came from Tracy (Mariel Hemingway): \"you shouldn't talk so much. You have a whiny voice.\" Hear! Hear! So I really do admire Woody for poking fun at himself. I also thought Mariel Hemingway (in one of her earlier roles) was very good as Tracy, Isaac's 17 year old love interest.Those things don't, however - for me at least - make up for the shortcomings of the movie. I rated it as a 3/10.",

In fact, you're practically guaranteed to wonder how it ever got made and nominated for Best Screenplay at the Academy Awards.Woody Allen wears his usual three hats (actor, writer, and director) in this black-and-white romantic drama. He's a resident of the great city trying to navigate through his troubled love life. He's admittedly middle-aged, but he's dating a minor, Mariel Hemingway. He falls for his best friend's girlfriend, Diane Keaton, and breaks Mariel's heart. And if things aren't complicated enough, his lesbian ex-wife, Meryl Streep, is writing a book about their terrible marriage. If this sounds like a winner to you, good luck and happy watching. It's very 1979, and it's just hard to take it seriously given today's modern attitudes about many of the subjects.",

But the content of the film is another thing. Basically, Woody Allen comes across as an egomaniacal creep who writes parts for himself in order to make him look like he's God's gift to women (there are so many references to his sexual prowess one could start a group drinking game based off it). And anybody with even a beginner's understanding of adolescent psychological development knows that men who pursue teenage girls are sick and sadistic bastards who find joy in ruining promising young lives. So my summary is: Like the film for its craft, but loathe the creator for his statement.",

            "content": "Manhattan is a movie that illustrates perfectly well the funny nature of Woody Allen, even if he's not trying to be. This is an odd movie for the 1970s in my opinion because it was chosen to be made in black and white, when most films had transitioned to color in the mid to late 1960s. This was obviously an artistic decision on Allen's part, because it helps make this film feel more moody. Taking place in what many consider the greatest city of the world, Manhattan starts with a comedy writer named Isaac (Woody Allen) arriving at a restaurant in Manhattan accompanied by some friends and his current love interest, Tracy (Mariel Hemingway), who is over 2 decades younger than him. Yale (Isaac's friend), is busy cheating on his wife Emily with a girl named Mary (Diane Keaton). Isaac eventually gets introduced to Mary, but she's too arrogant for his tastes. Despite this, he eventually starts to like her, but knows he's making a mistake because he is still going out with Tracy. Eventually, Isaac confesses to Tracy that he's unable to take her seriously because she's so much younger than he is and breaks off the engagement. This coincides with Yale's decision to dump Mary. Isaac seizes on the opportunity and goes out with Mary, which leads to her basically living with him. Some time later, Mary announces that she wants to reenter her relationship with Yale, and Isaac is too stunned to express any anger toward her. Instead, he goes to the school Yale teaches at and knocks on his door when he's teaching a class. A big argument ensues, in which Yale insists he found Mary before his friend did. Isaac criticizes him for using what he thinks is a 5 year old's logic and leaves. After this, Isaac lays on his couch and talks into a tape recorder, where he subconsciously starts talking about how beautiful he thinks Tracy is. He leaves his apartment to go find her, only to find out she's about to leave for the UK. Isaac apologizes for saying he didn't like her anymore, but Tracy's parents have already arranged for her to live in London. She promises to return to him after half a year. This is a strange movie. There's a lot of funny parts in it, such as when Woody says how masculine he looks holding a cigarette, but the storyline is a little too simple to qualify for classic film status. It's essentially about relationships going wrong and Woody going back to Tracy after he realizes he made a mistake by dating Mary. Diane Keaton here reminds me of her performance in Annie Hall, meaning that it's terribly funny to watch. Her and Allen have many arguments throughout the movie, as well as moments where he tries to seduce her. The fact that Woody resembles such a stereotypical nerd makes it all the more hilarious and unexpected. It seems like Diane realizes this because after all, she leaves him at the end. There's also the situation regarding the famous bridge scene that is used on the poster for this movie. Apparently, it was shot at 5 o'clock in the morning and the city's government automatically activates the lights on the bridge at a certain time. Allen wanted the lights to remain on until the scene was ready, but when they started filming, one set of them burned out, and he was forced to use that footage. Tracy is (in my view) the most important character in this movie because Woody doesn't take her seriously at first, and makes sure she understands this. There's not much she can do to change his mind other than letting herself age. In the final scene, he does take her seriously because she is going to Britain by herself, meaning she is independent now. I also thought it was strange how this black and white movie says in the credits that it uses Technicolor. That I can't understand. In any case, Manhattan is a pretty somber movie, but like I said, you'll probably feel the need to laugh every time Woody opens his mouth.",

I have all Woody Allen movies in my collection, but \"Manhattan\" is my favorite one, a masterpiece about relationship in a cold huge city. There are many fantastic lines along the witty story, with right doses of his typical bitter humor and romance. The black and white cinematography by Gordon Willis is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen in a film. There is a specific scene, used on the cover of the DVD and the poster of this movie, that is amazingly wonderful. Mariel Hemingway certainly has her best performance in the fantastic and very touching character Tracy. The music score, with Gershwin, completes this magnificent movie.

            "content": "There is no doubt that Woody Allen wholeheartedly loves New York City, but his attempt to illustrate the city in a Fellini-like fashion results in making the city look touristy. Seemingly the film has influenced the younger generation of New York based filmmakers and even they have made homage to this film (i.e., Jim Jarmusch's Stranger than Paradise similarly consists of well-composed medium shots and has a resembling scene of four persons sitting in a theatre. Also, Spike Lee's She's Gotta Have It features analogous landscape montages and has an akin scene of the protagonist running to meet his lover). Ironically, these youngsters present the city in more genuine manners and give Allen's Manhattan an obsolete look.Though the portrait of immature middle-aged people who can't deal with their relationships might be real, who wants to see that? Especially, Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) soliciting his former 17-year-old lover Tracy (Mariel Hemingway) not to leave for London, after discovering his other relationship doesn't work, is unbearable to watch. All central characters, maybe except 17-year-old Tracy, have the same typical-Allen-like personas in their ways of thinking and behaving--Allen might have a dictatorship as a director and it causes the lack of the characters' diversity. The screenplay contains many cliches (i.e., Allen's voiceover monologue on the opening montage to depict the city as a book's Chapter One, several pseudo-intellectual lines such as Isaac's describing his friends as \"pseudo-intellectual garbage\" talking about \"existential reality,\" Isaac's line \"Trouble is my middle name\" after his prospective lover says she's troublesome, and so on). Cinematography by Gordon Willis is inappropriately beautiful; the gap between the aesthetic visual and the half-grown content generates an uncompelling, halfway style.",

            "content": "Woody does two kinds of films: those in which he experiments by creating bold essays in exploration of a single idea, and those where he relaxes and employs his whole palette.This is one of his essays. In 'Annie Hall' the project was all about coordinated levels of narratives, trying to outdo 'Citizen Kane' in the variety an overlay of narrative types. In fact, there were dozens of types and a whole storyline that were cut to make the thing somewhat comprehendable.Here, he focuses on finely managed vision, the Eisensteinian overlay of images to build and build a fabric. That fabric is orchestrated from Gershwin, the fabric of the city and a remarkable framing of intimate scenes in a larger context. It is worth seeing on those terms alone. Framed movement.Everything is subservient to this essay, which is competent and original. But the story -- such as it is -- is there only as something to hold the space, a simple placeholder about seekers of warmth and shared breath.But even so, that story is completely captured by the remarkable Murial Hemingway. Everyone else acts, and their characters appear to be finding themselves. They fumble around with who they are. Muriel is true, so much so we suspect she is not acting at all, or at least not in the sense the others do.It is 25 years later, and that time has deepened this film, in part because few filmmakers since have used the anamorphic ratio for intimate purposes. The display of films on TeeVee screens has made that unfeasible. But there is something else. Watching Muriel, we know that this moment will be her fullest, her only connection with the transcendent. Forces of the city, not entirely unlike Woody's character, would disassemble and destroy her. That last, punctuated moment in the lobby would her movement into an abyss beyond the innocent purity she plays, and the visual approach to the material Woody underscores.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

            "content": "Woody puts on film how he learned about how callous relationships can be. He did it the hard way.He sees in his young companion that she is a beautiful 17 year old, when he is 42. It's the vanity of kidding yourself that you can still be physically appealing to such a fresh beauty; plus he got to parade her in front of his friends, as a token of imagined success. If a gorgeous young girl of that age really showed interest in an older man, he's going to think long and hard about not passing up the opportunity, because you don't get those lost years back. It also panders to his lustier instincts, as well.She probably would be lifeless, unenthusiastic, bored and boring to a middle-aged man who was not undergoing a life-crisis, but her youth was what fooled Ike into sometimes temporarily thinking he had it good in his life. She gave him a sense of relevance about himself as he fancied he could somehow pull off being a mentor and a lover all rolled into one. I think the point was that he deliberately chose a passive youngster that he could impose his tastes onto, because at the end when she starts to assert her independence, he isn't happy about it. The contradiction within those circumstances is that he can only wholly fall for someone who challenges him; that person in this case is the older Diane Keaton character.Maybe I'm wrong... but I hated Woody's character from almost immediately into this, and the last scenes made it all worthwhile to me and justified my caring about what happens to him, because it's such a turnaround.All through the movie he is using her and telling her that their relationship will only ever be a rest-stop on the path of her life, so when she finally assimilates that attitude, the hapless man can only tell her that his previous philosophising was hollow. He pretends to base his decisions on what's best for both of them, but really his choices are dictated only to afford himself an easier escape route, in the future. I'm a guy, I've had this done to me by a woman in the past, and to see naivete parlayed as a tactic again, by either sex, was painful. Thus I was gratified to see that the tables are swiftly turned at the resolution, and he is the member of the pair that is now suddenly finding themselves craving reassurance.It's a note of admittance to end on that will maybe help change his attitude to relationships in the future, and it inspires a kind of hope in the watching audience by suggesting that perhaps we can all learn from our mistakes, no matter how harsh they have to get. If I'm right, it was very brave of Woody to have his character be left so vulnerable in the end by his own narcissism. Granted it's not your typical overblown finish, but it was at least more illuminating to me. Even if I am the only one...",

            "content": "I won't rework the thorough comments which preceded mine here, because all the accolades I would give this film are stated quite eloquently. It is his best film; it does contain brilliant insights into human nature; it is visually breathtaking. I just want to mention a few aspects from my point of view.It has been on my list of the five best movies ever made ever since I saw it in 1979, chiefly for its realistic dialogue and probing commentary on the desperate nature of human beings in search of love, but I had never seen New York with my own eyes, so I could only try to accept but not fully understand Woody's love for Manhattan, which is firmly stated in the introductory narration.After my recent 4 day trip there, I have a new perspective - the city itself is so charmingly and compactly laid out, so full of history and culture and everything famous, that you can't go to New York without falling in love with it. After only 3 days I felt I wanted to live there. It is the city of not only Woody Allen but Bob Dylan, Tennessee Williams, Edgar Allan Poe, George Washington, Paul Newman, Jacqueline Onassis, and hundreds of other illustrious and creative people of the past and present.  The tour guides can't possibly squeeze in the whole story of every district and every building; the air just vibrates with this knowledge that you are in the greatest city in the world.The beauty of Manhattan that Woody conveys so perfectly in every camera shot and through the music of Gershwin  has new meaning for me because I was there. It's not so much a physical beauty but a feeling that all is right with the city, that this is what a city is supposed to be. It puts other cities to shame.All I can say is he fully succeeded in conveying what New York City is like. Not to mention that I now understand the obsession with delis; they have the best food in the world.I would also like to add my new perspective on the story itself - a very 70's plot of several people switching romantic partners back and forth at the drop of a hat. Diane Keaton's Mary remains the most perfect of the characterizations as the neurotic free spirit who despite her total self-absorption inspires our sympathy and affection. The 17 year old played by Mariel Hemingway is more irritating with the passage of 20 years, not because Woody's real-life obsession with young girls came to light, but because Mariel is a truly vapid non-actress with no ability to convey any depth or feeling. The constant commentary about her stunning beauty falls flat because she merely has a strikingly angular face, no personality and really possesses nothing except the bloom of youth and shiny hair. Mary rightly tells Isaac that his first wife becoming a lesbian \"explains the little girl.\"The denouement seems more unsatisfactory now than in previous viewings, and I want to shake the characters awake. But it was the seventies, and this is how people acted. It captures the times perfectly. I can't discuss who ends up with whom without spoiling the end for those who haven't seen it, but the problem for me is that the characters seem to live for the moment and if they can't have the one they want, they simply change partners without much strain.This attitude does not play quite so charmingly at the end of the 90's when fidelity is valued more highly than it was in the 70's.Nevertheless the beauty of the city stands alone no matter what the characters'  desperate machinations.And as a hilarious commentary on the human instinct to find someone to love no matter what the consequences, there is nothing finer. Though I might not approve of Isaac's final choice, his almost religious experience which brings him to that conclusion is a stunning climax to the film. Whether he changes his mind about who is the right one for him, he has learned something crucial about what really is important to him in life.The true stars of the movie are Manhattan, never more beautiful, and Diane Keaton, never more brilliant.",

Had that remark been made to me, I would have said, \"No.  Just pretentious.\"  It's a verdict I would reach concerning all of Allen's overrated 1979 film, the first in which he starred since the Oscar winning \"Annie Hall.\"  Here, he continues the wearying pseudo-intellectual tone of that earlier film, but while \"Annie Hall\" compensated for its pretentions with an abundance of humor, much of it aimed at pseudo-intellectuals (Allen apparently does not recognize himself as a member of this group), the laughs in \"Manhattan\" (and there are plenty of them) are unintentional.  As usual, Allen's characters speak in the vernacular of dime store psychologists and art critics, repeatedly referring to \"hostility,\" as well as Freud and Bergman--Ingmar, of course, not Ingrid, although I doubt that any of these smug characters could say an intelligent word about \"The Bells of St. Mary's,\" let alone \"The Seventh Seal.\"  \"I'm beautiful, I'm bright, and I deserve better,\" Keaton says at one point, but her self-assessment would be more accurately applied to Meryl Streep who, as the wife who dumps Allen for another woman, IS beautiful, bright, and certainly deserving of something better than this mess concocted by a man whose character is described as someone who \"longed to be an artist but balked at the necessary sacrifices.\"  In \"Manhattan,\" Allen balks like never before, dishing up superficially \"deep\" subject matter, but lacking the insight and, I suspect, the experience, to adequately probe it.  Allen, the aloof and reclusive New Yorker, has made an arty, though not artistic, vanity production that demonstrates a poor grasp on any life outside his own snobby circle.  And, like a circle, \"Manhattan\" doesn't end, it merely stops, dead in its tracks.  It is, however, his second funniest film. (The funniest, by a long shot, is \"Interiors.\")",

They are films that have either aged badly (\"Jaws\") or were never any good in the first place (\"The French Connection\"), and continue to receive excessive praise over the years, without really deserving it. \"Manhattan\" should be included in that list.This is a comedy with very few laughs, and a drama with four main characters but only with ONE who has any depth; Woody Allen's. The other three are superficial caricatures. And who thought it was such a wise idea to make Keaton's character so unlikable? It's depressing for anyone who remembers how sweet and lovely she was in \"Play It Again, Sam\". As for Mariel Hemingway's performance, it could hardly be more forced. And the ending is so abrupt that you'll be surprised, but not pleasantly.Allen's most astonishing accomplishment in this movie may be that he actually managed to make New York City look perhaps more uninviting and unattractive than I've ever seen it before in the movies. Even films than focus on its \"ugly\", crime-infested side manage to suggest that there is life in this city, that it's exciting and thrilling. Here it looks just DRAB. Yes, the background music is wonderful, but the b/w cinematography isn't particularly beautiful - there were many scenes that would benefit greatly if they were filmed in color.After reading all the reviews and comments about this movie, I expected a lot more. It was a big disappointment. How can people prefer this to the vastly superior \"Hannah And Her Sisters\"?",

Woody Allen is always on and he continues a running commentary, even as others speak. Thank goodness. He's funnier than they are. We have the soft romance between him and his young co-star. It is doomed from the beginning because he is in a different search. He lack of experience, however, makes her wiser than he is. She is a great catch, but you imagine her outgrowing him as her sense of life expands. We have the other subplots: the cruelty of the the ex-wife (Meryl Streep) who bullies him. The indiscretions of his friend and the appearance of the ever present Diane Keaton. This is such a complex movie, full of surprises and subtlety. It is also a love story of a city. Being a Midwesterner who has only visited Manhattan a few times, there's no way I can have a true appreciation of all that this movie is. All I know is that there is a sadness over it all, a sadness that we as human beings inherit and carry with us. As thinking beings we carry our thoughts and sometimes those thoughts get in the way of our happiness. This movie brings out that delicate wire act of life.",

This is classic Woody, filled with snappy dialogue, unexpected plot twists and sparkling performances, especially by Keaton, Hemingway (who was nominated for an Oscar), and Michael Murphy as Woody's best friend...and it's all filmed in glorious black and white. I don't think the city that Woody loves so dearly has ever looked more glorious than it does in this film...this is definitely Woody's valentine to New York and it is a film made with delicacy and grace and, like most of Woody's films, features a beautiful musical score, a loving tribute to the magic of George Gershwin.

            "content": "The majestic buildings, the gravity-defying bridges, the beautiful imagery of New York City in black-and-white pulsating to the rhythm of George Gershwin's \"Rhapsody in Blue\" like fireworks of emotions, this is Manhattan, a town with a soul. Whether dangerous, insomniac, intellectual or streetwise, New York is again the perfect arena for the eternal battle between brains and passions, dreams and reality, hope and disillusions, indispensable for some minds in quest of inspiration.Woody Allen is one of these minds, Isaac, the character he plays, too, but Isaac mirrors more of Allen's personality than any other character he played. It's the medium of Woody's soul allowing him to say that \"Bergman is the only genius of Cinema\" and to express his contempt toward \"pseudo-intellectual\" stuff, like an alibi against his detractors. But Woody doesn't deny his flaws, his character represents the struggle of a soul trying to embody Manhattan's incarnation of the American Dream, but as he stutters in the opening line, unable to pass 'Chapter One', he can't find inspiration. His friend Yale (Michael Murphy) says he's got a \"Freudian\" relationship with New York, it's more than that, it's Oedipian because he knows he's in love with this city, but is incapable to make himself worthy of that love. But Manhattan is more than a movie about love; it's about the strange effect of love in mature people. And Isaac, like Woody is mature \u0085 age-wise of course. Isaac is 42, and he realizes it's an interesting age where his mind became his greatest asset, and since he evolves in an artistic milieu, he's clearly in his advantage. Through \"Manhattan\" and Gershwin's music, it's the whole intellectual and artistic underground world of New York that lets its soul implode, it's to New York what Saint-Germain was to Paris in the existentialist 50's. But in the 70's, New York became the center of the underground culture, of sexual liberation, of the whole questioning of the American heritage without the idealism of the late 60's or the pessimism of the post-Nixon era. Everything is debatable, war, marriage, orgasms and nothing is to be taken for granted. The film was made in 1979, just before the 80's would provide their depressing cynicism and flamboyant superficiality, not sure Isaac could have quited his job of screenwriter for TV programs to fulfill his dream of writing a book in the 80's, (a coincidence that he finally works on TV in \"Hannah and Her Sisters\"?)Aware or not that the days of his sex appeal are numbered, Isaac seems to have a way with women and to enjoy that, too. He had two wives, and now he's dating Tracy a 17-year old high school girl (Mariel Hemingway), but he has a crush on Mary, Diane Keaton, Yale's mistress. The way he handles the two relationships is a masterstroke of clever writing and realism. In the beginning, he finds Mary not only too pompous, but calls her a pseudo- intellectual, unaware that he behaves the same way when he's with Tracy, becoming the typical neurotic Allen-guy. Love is a field of paradoxes, Isaac embodies the hypocritical break-up excuse, when the one who breaks says: \"You deserve better\" (meaning the opposite of course) and Mary who doesn't want to wreck a marriage feels hurt when Yale breaks up with her. Allen's directing never 'accuses', we feel this strange chemistry going between Mary and Isaac, in a romantic moment where they're in the dark planetarium, they're about to kiss, but Isaac retracts, because he's still with Tracy, what Mary understands. These subtle, yet delicate moments elevate \"Manhattan\" above anything we saw before, and even after.An on the top of these moments, there's the image of Mariel Hemingway's eyes tearing when she realizes he didn't love her and he's making a whole pointless speech while her heart is broken. Hemingway, who deserved her Oscar nomination for that role, is genuinely sweet, tender and natural in what probably is the most difficult role of the film, because she has no monologues, she's doesn't belong to that tormented world, all she sees is that she cares for Isaac and she's in love with him, something that Isaac fails to consider. Allen is a genius in the way he portrays sentimental relationships and how we're more eager to love people we idealize than those who idealize us, and how we tend to lie to ourselves, just to satisfy our egos more than our hearts. An interesting subplot involves a book written by Isaac's ex-wife, played by Meryl Streep and in a scene where Mary, Yale and his wife finally read some excerpts, they all laugh at him. And as viewers, we know that Tracy wouldn't have laughed.\"Manhattan\"'s ending is as sweet and realistic as it could get, people who lied to themselves reveal their true feelings, and Isaac realized that his heart was kept as hostage of a sort of sentimental blackmail between his girlfriend and his best friend. \"Manhattan\" is the realization of a man who loved intellectuality and intellectualized love, at the end, when he's lost everything, his job, his girl, out of false impulses. He finds himself the remedy for the pain, in one of the most memorable scenes of Allen's filmography when he records all the things that makes life worth living: Groucho Marx, Flaubert's \"Sentimental Education\", Bergman, Brando and as we expect, it ends with \u0085 Tracy. The film's ending is a mix of \"Casablanca\" and \"City Lights\" and Allen tries to find the perfect note to convince Tracy to come back to him, all it will take him is some patience and a \"little faith in people\".Tracy's concluding lines confirm that \"brain is the most overrated organ\", and how ironic that it comes from Woody Allen, in what remains one of his greatest films, so sweet, intelligent and witty that I guess I would nominate his scripts as one of the things that make my life worth living.",

Diane Keaton is more irritating than ever, even more so than as Annie Hall, but it is Mariel Hemingway's amateurish and insufferable presence that throws this movie out of court altogether.'Manhattan' is one of the few films that I actually cannot stand to view, which is too bad because Woody is very entertaining as the anti-hero.

The more the movie was going on, the more I realised it wasnt really a satire. The posers from college are 20 years older. They are the exact same, with the narcissism, the namedropping and the superficial knowledge. Now, they have a ton of money, so they can make movies about themselves. The only satirical thing about it is that they now have a tiny bit of self-awareness. The more into the movie I was getting, the more convinced that I was of this. Even the directing style seemed less impressive... it felt more and more borrowed from older masters. Its hard not to talk about the ending... which I found disturbing. Knowing what we know, its hard to think that Allen isnt exposing his own decision-making processes when he is writing this scene.It is true that I judged this movie with a very specific framing, that I focus a lot on intents instead of results... and that many people love this film. If you are more capable of separating the art from the artist more than I am... go for it... its still a classic. I don't think I will be watching more of Woody Allen's movies, though.",

            "content": "Manhattan has an almost perfect opening\u0085 No, I'll start that again. Manhattan DOES have a perfect opening. No sooner has the film started than you're hit by the sublime synthesis of George Gershwin's music, Gordon Willis' black and white widescreen photography and Woody Allen's voice-over. It's a combination that spoils the senses and one that plainly states Allen's intentions. This is a movie with a capital M.It's also a poem to New York. The opening monologue expresses all of Allen's contradictory feelings towards the town through a series of possible openings for a novel his character is writing. It's beautifully written and very funny. But it's also very romantic, as even when he's criticising the place it's clear he loves it. And with Allen's words you have Willis' images. The city has never looked better.Then the voice-over stops and you have fireworks set to Gershwin's music. It's a New York that doesn't exist in real life, only on film and in Allen's mind. Yet it's ridiculously appealing. Just for a little while you fall in love with this version of New York too.Such a great opening raises expectations, but Manhattan more than lives up to it. My favourite bit is another one of the romantic moments in film. It's the shot that is used on the posters of Woody Allen and Diane Keaton sitting on a bench in front of the 59th Street Bridge. It's probably one of the best shots in cinema \u0096 it's ridiculously simple but it also ridiculously beautiful.But my favourite scene in the film is the party scene. Isaac (Allen) goes to a party full of pretentious snobs who are talking about orgasms. One of the men there is a filmmaker. He explains his concept. \"I'm just about to direct a film of my own script. The premise is this guy screws so great that when he brings a woman to orgasm, she's so fulfilled that she dies.\" Then a woman brings up that she finally had an orgasm but her doctor told her it was the wrong kind. To which Isaac says that he's never had the wrong kind that even his worst was right on the money. Oh, and before this, they talk about a Nazi parade that is being planned in Manhattan. Another one of the women chimes in with her vapid viewpoint. \"But biting satire is always better than physical force.\" And again, Isaac is the voice of sanity. \"No, physical force is better with Nazis.\" I really do hope that rich parties are like this. I'd be terribly disappointed if they weren't rife with pretension and champagne posturing.But although the party scene is essentially a throwaway, sexual politics is definitely a theme (as it is in most of Allen's films). Isaac, who's 42, is going out with a 17-year old and his second ex-wife divorced him to live with her female lover. And to make it worse, his ex has written a book about their marriage. This leads to another funny scene where his friends read aloud extracts detailing his many failings. But from this marriage he has a young son. And Isaac is worried about two women bringing him up. \"I always feel very few people survive one mother.\" But to complicate things even further, Isaac starts seeing Mary (Keaton) who's the lover of Isaac's friend Yale who's married. Fidelity is a quaint concept in Allen's world.However, with everyone indulging their whims, you'd expect them to be happy. Only they're not. It seems like when you can have everything you only end up making yourself miserable. What people need is stability. They need grounding. But in a place as vast as Manhattan, you never stay still, a point illustrated by Isaac having to move halfway through. He may love New York but he has no roots. And he's frightened of putting them down. After all, he has a great thing with the 17-year old Tracy. She's smart, she's fun and she's half his age, yet he seems intent on sabotaging their relationship. He cheats on her with the more neurotic Mary. And it's quite clear that Mary and Isaac aren't really right for one another. They may be pretty much the same age, but they don't have the same taste in movies, books and art; there's a funny scene where Isaac first meets Mary and they all talk about their tastes. Isaac gets visibly annoyed when Mary criticises Ingmar Bergman. I share Isaac's pain. There's nothing more annoying that someone ragging on your favourite director (or writer or musician or band or\u0085).But amidst the quiet despair there are moments of ease and happiness. You have the moment on the bridge, the bit where Isaac and Tracy ride through Central Park and the bit when Isaac and Tracy are watching TV in bed. But they're all fleeting and they all seem to be private moments. In public Isaac seems to be embarrassed by Tracy. He's dating a girl who does homework and he's older than her father. He doesn't seem to be able to handle the scrutiny that their relationship attracts. And when he goes out publicly with Mary it results in more awkwardness \u0096 he goes to the theatre with Mary who's next to her ex-lover Yale who's next to his wife. And besides, his relationship with Mary seems to be more of a product of loneliness. Therefore the ending is bittersweet. He finally admits his feelings for Tracy but it's too late. He's screwed up his opportunity. But that doesn't mean the ending is sombre. If anything, it's upbeat. You may feel there's no hope for this immature man (he baulks at having to wait a mere six months for her as she studies in London) but you feel there's a lot for this mature girl.",

There is the constant praise for Bergman and the existentialist Swedish cinema, for example, which is not surprisingly given Allen's praise in other films to Dostoevsky and his own brand of dark existentialism. Is Allen a cynic or a pessimist? The relationship aspect is interesting and real. The talk of a man who loves his wife but wants to pursue a fling is all too common, I think. I appreciate that this was approached with honesty -- the man has not stopped loving his wife, he has simply found another. The story is also told from the point of view of \"the other woman\", which may be the most complicated angle of all. I will not even do into the concept a 40-year old man dating a 17-year old girl.

Soon he starts to find his married friend's mistress (Diane Keaton) fascinating and the two strike up a relationship. I don't think this film comes anywhere close to the brilliance of ANNIE HALL but this is a different and certainly interesting look at relationships. I'm really not sure what Allen was wanting to say with the picture but it's clear he's going into high gear in terms of the influence of Ingmar Bergman and it's funny that the Swedish director gets a good scene where his type of films are discussed and debated by the Allen and Keaton characters. The beautiful B&W cinematography by Gordon Willis is without question some of the best you're ever going to see and you can't help but feel as if you're watching a Bergman film. The stark cinematography really brings the city to life as every shadow of the city is beautifully brought to life and really does become its own character. I think Allen's screenplay has a lot of items that we've seen in previous movies but they're shown here in a different manor. I thought the film is certainly a lot deeper than anything the director had previously done and most shockingly is that Allen himself manages to be quite believable as a dramatic actor. One of the best scenes in the movie has Allen trying to explain to his 17-year-old girlfriend about how life is eventually going to catch up with her and take her into different directions. The relationship between a 17-year-old and a 42-year-old is going to be shocking to some viewers but I think it's handled quite well in the film and the message of age not really mattering certainly comes across. Allen has no problem with the black comedy scattered throughout the film but the real eye-opener is the dramatic stuff. As you'd expect his chemistry with Keaton is pitch-perfect and even though they had appeared in numerous films together by this point, the characters are so different and Keaton's plays hers so well that you can't help but feel as if this is the first time we're seeing them. Hemingway comes across extremely mature in her role and Streep is perfect as the ex-wife. I've never been tool thrilled with Michael Murphey as the friend but he's not horrible. MANHATTAN is clearly a film about relationships but it's also a very clever love letter to New York and this is easily visible in the terrific opening sequence where Allen, as the narrator, tries to explain his love for the city while we get various location shots. The film is beautifully put together by the director as it goes in and out from drama to comedy but it's flow is perfectly done and in the end you've got a highly intelligent art film.",

            "review_title": "Woody Allen's Most Penetrating Analysis of Human Relationships",
            "content": "As another reviewer has pointed out, \"Manhattan\" does not fit the normal template for a successful film. In 1979, black-and-white photography had been out of favour in the cinema for over a decade. The film has little in the way of action, with more attention paid to dialogue and character development. Although there is humour, and the plot concerns the emotional entanglements of a group of friends, it is not a romantic comedy in the normal sense of the term. All the above points might seem to be weaknesses, and in some films they would have been. In Woody Allen's hands, however, what might have been weaknesses become strengths. The central character in the film is Isaac Davis, a writer, played by Woody himself. Isaac is divorced from his bisexual wife Jill, who is now involved in a lesbian relationship, and is dating Tracy, a seventeen-year-old schoolgirl. (The film, it should be noted, was made before Woody became involved with Mia Farrow, let alone with Soon-Yi. Did he realise when making it how life would come to imitate art more than a decade later?) Isaac, however, is also finding himself drawn to Mary, the mistress of his best friend Yale. Yale is married and conducting a secret affair with Mary, who is becoming dissatisfied with the relationship because Yale seems reluctant to leave his wife Emily. The above outline of the plot might give the impression that it is all very much standard Woody Allen stuff; the emotional difficulties of a bunch of self-centred, neurotic middle-class New Yorkers. Such an impression would be, at most, a half-truth. Although Woody has dealt with similar material in a number of other films (most recently in \"Melinda and Melinda\"), \"Manhattan\" represents one of his greatest accomplishments, rising above even his own normal high standards. The main reasons for this are the quality of the acting and the quality of the script. All six of the main roles are played very well. Emily and Jill may be minor characters in terms of on-screen time, but both are important in terms of their contributions to the plot. Anne Byrne's Emily is attractive, but we can sense a certain coolness and reserve about her and understand how her husband might have been drawn to another, more vivacious, woman. Jill (Meryl Streep in one of her earliest film roles) hides her bitterness and vindictiveness beneath a veneer of honesty and truthfulness. She publishes a book which she claims is an honest account of her marriage and divorce but which in reality is merely a device for revenging herself on her ex-husband. As Blake said:\"A truth that's told with bad intent Beats all the lies you can invent\".The other four main characters form a sort of eternal quadrilateral instead of the more usual triangle. Isaac is a nervous, insecure intellectual who uses a sort of self-deprecating humour as a cover for his insecurities. This is the sort of part that we have come to associate with Woody Allen, but he has seldom played it as well as he does here. There is perhaps less concentration on humour than in some Allen films, but even so Isaac still manages to deliver some classic lines. (\"I think people should mate for life, like pigeons or Catholics\"). Diane Keaton's Mary is outgoing and lively but also conceited, self-centred and something of a pseudo-intellectual. She and Yale, another self-centred character, probably deserve each other. For me, however, the best and most perfectly-judged contribution came from Mariel Hemingway as Tracy, played here not as a precociously seductive Lolita or as a spoilt brat but as a charming but vulnerable girl next door. Perhaps more important, however, than any individual performance is the way in which the characters relate to one another; it is a film where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. A musical analogy might be with a quartet, where a small group play together in harmony, rather than with a concerto which is dominated by one bravura performance. Like many other lovers of this film, I was particularly impressed by the striking black-and-white photography of New York locations, particularly in the opening scenes. As one might expect from a director who is himself a talented musician, Woody normally pays a lot of attention to his musical scores; here the music of George Gershwin, particularly his \"Rhapsody in Blue\", seems very appropriate to the mood of the film. These factors contribute greatly to the success of this film, but for me it is perhaps most memorable as Woody's most penetrating analysis of human relationships. It is a film that I find more in every time I see it. 10/10",

In it he does little more than he always does, but he does it so WELL.  The Allen monologue, which is never less than entertaining and, in some vague way, comforting - but in some films is never more than that - here delivers punchline after punchline.  The very sub-clauses are well crafted and more than one character gets to deliver them.  The plot is little more than a shuffling of romantic interests, but it's perfectly proportioned, so who cares.  The characters we can all enjoy getting to know.  (And it does feel as though we're getting to know them.)  Here's what to me was most remarkable: for the first time, I sensed that Allen himself is a good, not just adequate, actor.As anyone will tell you, the black-and-white photography is gorgeous, just gorgeous.  Every Allen film romanticises some time and place; not that I've seen them all, but I'm sure \"Manhattan\" romanticises better than any other. The cinematographer is Gordon Willis.  To be honest, I wouldn't know him from a bar of soap, but the images are so entrancing he has to be mentioned. ...This has all been said before.  Why am I saying it again?  Probably because I've seen so many bad films recently; seeing \"Manhattan\", and then describing it, helps restore my faith.",

Allen followed his acclaimed ANNIE HALL with this, his plush black and white stylized tribute to New York City and director Ingmar Bergman, but it's not as good and doesn't offer much for the viewer other than the glitz. Allen plays a middle-aged writer of 42 named Isaac, who is divorced from his ex-wife (Meryl Streep - who is now living with another woman in a lesbian relationship), and now dates and sleeps with a 17 year-old high school student (the emotionless Mariel Hemingway). But he gets his head turned when he meets Diane Keaton again, which is becoming more than a little redundant after PLAY IT AGAIN SAM, SLEEPER, and ANNIE HALL. Diane is involved in an affair with a married friend of Woody's, a guy who isn't sure whether to risk his marriage or not.The artsy gray backdrop of New York is really at the heart of the film, but the conflicting relationships themselves here don't really go anywhere. The only point I can surmise from all of this is that romance can be complicated and partners will tend to play musical chairs and use each other if need be, just out of to keep from being alone. Nowhere is this clearer than at the self-centered conclusion of MANHATTAN, which coughs up one of the most abrupt and unsatisfying endings of all time. (One comment for the many people who are so repulsed by \"middle-aged Isaac dating the 17-aged student\": just relax -- in the movie, Woody exclaims that she's nearly 18... so what, do people think that in just a few weeks the girl's suddenly mature enough overnight?). **1/2 out of ****",

Although Woody Allen's New York City is different from the rest of the world, he's the neurotic Brooklyn Jewish intellectual cerebral writer, director, and actor who gets the best looking girlfriends to ease his insecurities. In this film, he is seeing a teenage high school drama student played by Mariel Hemingway (she deserved her Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress here). Isaac divorced his second wife, Jill, or she divorced him and left him for a woman. Jill is played by Meryl Streep. Despite a small role, Streep is brilliant. Jill is writing a book about their marriage which doesn't go over so well for Isaac. His best friends and couple, Yale and Emily, are having problems. Yale is having an affair with Mary, (played by Diane Keaton) and Emily doesn't know anything about it. If you've ever watched Woody Allen movies, you will understand this film. It's shot beautifully in black and white in widescreen cinematography and utilizes the Gershwin score of music to highlight the city and the film. Sometimes, I think the music is the star of this film. It highlights the city in it's glory, beauty, and charm.",

You can really sense Allen's love for NYC and I admit, though not a New Yorker, I fell for the city too.As for the plot, ok it's a film that couldn't be shot today as it deals with a 42 year old, twice divorced man, a father no less, who is dating a 17 year old high schooler. Getting past that, this is a story of a group of neurotic, self absorbed people who project so much authority and opinion about the lives and endeavors of others, but yet are unable to project much of anything other than dysfunction in their own lives.There is a particularly painful scene when Issac, played by Allen, is breaking things off with Tracy, played by Mariel Hemingway. You really feel for the girl, she is young, inexperienced, has fallen in love with the older man and is now experiencing rejection and heartbreak for the first time. There is also a lot of humor in the film. What I especially enjoyed is the humor didn't sink to vulgarity or cheap talk about bodily functions or anatomy jokes. The subject was handled with maturity and wasn't insulting. Towards the end of the film Issac attempts to persuade Tracy not to go to London to study, but Tracy is a precocious young lady telling Issac that he must have faith in people insinuating she'll return to him. Just an overall good film about the complications of adult life told in a humorous yet mature manner. Enjoy.",

I can see that she was supposed to display that there are no confines between two people loving each other even if the difference of age is 25 years. The main problem was that Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) did not believe from the very beginning that their love could come true. He believed in such a firm way which made me loose interest focusing on his and Tracy's (Mariel Hemingway) relationship. But on the other hand, it is a terrific example for love finding people at random.After the appearance of Mary Wilkie (Diane Keaton) there was a slight turn in the film as it was a kind of predictable that her and Isaac would find each other sooner or later. I think, she delivered a memorable performance and I cannot comprehend why she did not get nominated for an Academy Award.Anyway, Manhattan is a delightful film with the usual Woody Allen message.9 OUT OF 10",

            "content": "What can understandably bother some about the characters in Woody Allen's metropolitan fable are all well off, financially speaking. They live and thrive in a magnificent culture oasis of plays, films, books, and art galleries. Idealistic music by George Gershwin seems contrary to these self-centered characters. Gordon Willis's black-and-white cinematography depicts the cityscape of Manhattan in all of its distinctions. The characters move in a haze, changing partners, arrangements, and dreams faster than gravity. But that is it's portrait. It's a strikingly frank rendering of a sort of person in a sort of place and their immersion in their nostalgic, loving perception of it.Look at how Gordon Willis shot it. Not just the sumptuous black and white or the implicitly beautiful locale. His exteriors are wide shots whenever possible, our main characters in the mid- or background as other everyday activities are going on, no matter how mundane. Count the dialogue scenes in which the camera is completely stationary, the characters temporarily leaving frame and returning. The camera doesn't move; its subjects do. They always are. That's what defines them.In the opening scene of the film, flourishing TV comedy writer Isaac Davis (Woody) is attempting to pin down thoughts about city of the eponymous burrough. He both loves and hates the place. He's of two minds about another thing, too. Immediately after he quits his job, both on principle and so as to write a novel, we cut to him telling his friend Yale he's doubtful that he's done the right thing. These fluid sorts change so regularly they may never know what they actually want. And droll self-ridicule is fashionable not only because it's a Woody Allen film, but also because of who these particular characters are.Isaac's first wife, a kindergarten teacher, left him, began using drugs and moved to San Francisco. The last he heard, she was working for the William Morris Agency. In this quirky sketch of one woman's pilgrimage, we see a familiar protean transfer from escapism to pop therapy to religious repression to the safest of all shelters, materialism. Issac's second wife, Meryl Streep in only her third film role, left him for a lesbian lover who's raising his son with her. While this bites Isaac, he's even more worried about having his private life bared when her book Marriage Divorce and Selfhood is published.Yale, played by Michael Murphy with lifelike fraudulence, is having an affair with Mary, a brisk, jumpy Radcliff-grad journalist. The mind's just as much a turn-on as the body for the elastic urban intellectual. Yale's forlorn as a literature teacher. He knows he should write his Eugene O'Neill biography but he just can't get down to it. For these sorts of folks, the grass is always greener on the other side of the occupational hedge. And their self-absorption blinds them to the wishes of others. His wife Emily wants to have a child but he has his own self-seeking needs to address.Diane Keaton's performance as Mary almost equals her brilliantly unique rendering of Annie Hall. Mary knows the cost of everything in the world of her mind. But she doesn't know the significance of anything. So she goes with her feelings, because despite all her high-falutin' intellectual pomposity, her feelings are all that count. When Yale can't choose whether or not to leave his wife, Mary zeroes in on Isaac. And Keaton's inspired acting reaches a peak in her scene in which she deflects from the emotional panic she feels when breaking off with Yale.So she and Isaac work out an edgy relationship, not entirely sure where to go. To make room in his life for Mary, Isaac leaves Tracy, the seventeen-year-old he's been dating, and Mariel Hemingway's most famous role, Oscar-nominated. Her love for him proves too astringent and challenging. Don't Fence Me In is as good as Gershwin for these characters. Once Yale discovers that Isaac and Mary are together, he buys a new car to jiggle around with. When all else fails, there's materialism. Nearly all of the characters in this Annie Hall-meets-Interiors Panavision feast allow their hunger for self-variation and leeway to thrust them from one person, occupation or ambition to another.That this movie seems self-indulgent and self-indulgent to its detractors is a testament to its fluctuating sense of the ever-fluctuating sort of individual who has difficulty seizing authentic and satisfying relationships with others. Love's too hard to preserve, and commitment gets under these people's skin. Change is in the rubber of their soles, and the destination they seek is forever around the next corner. Careers, cultural ideals, frame of mind, religious attitudes are there to be welcomed, personalized, set free again. They fluctuate ideas and interests in proportion to mood or impulse. By nature, these mercurial folks are forever in transit.Manhattan, yes, both the movie and the place, are both the early culmination of and psychosomatic reference point for the themes of Allen's bittersweet movies and cultivates his characteristic serio-comic tone, in conjunction with Gordon's Willis inspired, opulently felt black-and-white imagery and George Gershwin's expressive score, an ode to the splendor and distinction of the city itself, presenting the real Manhattan in such a way that you feel the Hollywood Manhattan is really there.",

He is writing a book and struggling to make the move from a comedy writer on TV to a `more worthy' pursuit of proper literature.  Combined with this he is trying to balance the women in his life, going out with an 17 year old girl, his lesbian ex-wife is writing a book based on the break-up of their relationship and a hostile relationship with Mary begins to involve him.Rightly known as one of Allen's best films.  Here he manages to get the tone right between out and out comedy and a more mature introspective look at relationships and self.  This isn't my favourite of his films as I admit to liking his `earlier, funnier films', but this falls between the two phases and there is much to enjoy here.On one level the film is a love story to New York - it isn't about New York so much as about some of it's inhabitants, but the camera takes in that skyline every chance it gets and the music compliments it well.  On the main plot we have the usual Allen storyline of relationships starting and breaking down with the usual problems and witty remarks - it's the same story he's been telling for years but he manages to get away with it so who am I to pass judgement?  It is good unless you hate Allen and it does allow comedy even if it feels a little self indulgent - at least it finishes on a positive note.It is flawed even by his standards.  It's quite pretentious in many ways. Of course a lot of his films are but with, say, Annie Hall, there was enough real good laughs to cover all bases.  Here the arty shots and slightly less comic feel to it reveal him to be soul searching and not really drawing on any wider experiences.  I know that anyone can only truly draw on their own experiences but this film resembles no life I've ever lived and is solely focused on Allen's own arty lifestyle.Hence it's not my favourite - I don't really like him when he tries to be very arty and deep.  1 he is usually being selfish and almost making the film for himself and 2 it's like he's saying to the mass audience `I'm too good for you so I'm not even going to try and make this easy for you'. Here though he just about avoids that trap.As director and actor Allen is good and copes with his own problems and the delivery of good lines.  Keaton is given a better character than Anne Hall but seems to get less funny as a result.  Streep is happily only in a few scenes and Hemingway is annoying.  This is the Allen & New York show and they carry it well enough to cover the weaknesses.Not my favourite Allen film and indeed not his - at the time he begged for it to be shelved and he'd do it again for free but it was released.  I wonder was it too arty for him or not arty enough?  Regardless fans will enjoy this as I did, but many others will prefer more of the humour and less of the big words and naval gazing.",

            "content": "Manhattan is one of Woody Allen's more restrained comedies as he divides his lovemaking between a 17 year old, a self confident pseudo intellectual and the borough of Manhattan. Allen is 42 year old Issac, a divorced television writer dating high schooler Tracy (Mariel Hemingway). Decrying the cool medium for it's lack of creativity he quits in frustration and regrets it immediately. His ex (Meryl Streep) further humiliates him by writing a tell all. He then becomes involved with friend Yale's (Michael Murphy) more age appropriate former mistress Mary(Diane Keaton). Breaking off his relationship with Tracy he gets more deeply involved with Mary but all doesn't go smooth.Manhattan's storyline moves along at a breezy pace with Allen's dialog more tempered towards light comedy with dramatic undertones than his usual screwball approach. Keaton's Mary is less zany and more down to earth than her clownish Annie Hall character and Issac's intellectual equal from the outset. His sexual/intellectual prodigy relationship with Tracy is conveniently rationalized as Mariel Hemingway says little (\"I go to high school\")but remains touchingly effective. Allen's debatable exploitation of a minor is softened by Issac who displays more paternalism than lust for Tracy even though he must give unto Moliere in the film's final minutes. The real star of the picture though remains the title character. Breathing life and romance into the story Allen makes Manhattan a movable feast of busy scenes and ambiance. East Side, West Side, up, down or mid town Allen's backdrop carried along by strains of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue and Gordon Willis' impressive cinematography celebrates a city in all its glory elevating the hum drum, common existence of the players by infusing them with its energy. At times its dominance threatens to overwhelm the story and its self absorbed petty intellectuals but Allen wisely refrains from signature slapstick to pad roles and disrupt the film's sentimental melancholia for the sake of balance. Less strident and more somber than his previous comedy efforts Manhattan shows a maturity and sophistication that would inform his best work throughout the 80s.",

Really just a romantic-drama, and nothing more. The clever humour which usually typifies Woody Allen movies is very few and far between and what there is generally doesn't quite have the some intelligence and zing as his usual stuff.So that just leaves it as a drama, and, as mentioned, it's just a romantic drama, so nothing too profound can come from it. There are some decent intrigues to sustain the movie, but that is about it.The 42-year-old-with-17-year-old was also a bit creepy. This aspect of the movie seemed to be explained well and the issue gotten past, but then the conclusion wrecks that. Very unsatisfactory ending, and undoes a lot of the progress that came before it.On the plus side, there were some good jabs at the pretentiousness of New York society. The cinematography is great too: filmed in black and white with some wonderful, loving, lingering shots of New York skylines and landmarks. Can't fault the performances either. Woody Allen does what he does best - playing himself. Diane Keaton is the pick of the bunch as the intelligent, over-analysing, knowingly-beautiful, self-obsessed Mary.

            "content": "Perhaps a quarter-century is enough to overlook the unavoidable prescience of this 1979 social dramedy in depicting Woody Allen's future relationship with and marriage to 35-years younger Soon-Yi Previn. I hope so because viewing it for the first time since its original release, I think it's probably still his most mature and romantic film. Neither as hilariously quirky as \"Annie Hall\" nor as expansive in perspective as \"Hannah and Her Sisters\", this film focuses almost exclusively on the degrees of human fallibility in its central characters, almost all of whom are writers and consequently acute, sometimes pretentious observers of the life around them.Allen portrays Isaac Davis, a neurotic but successful TV writer who at 42, has soured on love after two failed marriages. Almost in emotional retaliation, he has taken up with Tracy, a seventeen-year old high school student. She is a calming influence but one he refuses to take seriously given her tender years. Isaac's frustrated best friend Yale, married twelve years to Emily, has been having an affair with an irritatingly self-absorbed editor named Mary. Realizing the relationship cannot go anywhere, Mary breaks it off and finds herself drawn to Isaac. Concurrently caught in an unexpected career change, Isaac starts to face realities about his own emotional state, and complications ensue in a most resonant manner. In fact, the last five minutes are the most achingly romantic that Allen has put on film.What remains impressive about this true masterwork is the unbeatable combination of the clever, penetrating script by Allen and Marshall Brickman (reunited from \"Annie Hall\"), the grandly orchestrated Gershwin pieces as a musical chorus and the astonishing black-and-white cinematography of Gordon Willis. As usual for an Allen film, the performances are uniformly accomplished. In something of an about-face from the lovable Annie, Diane Keaton unapologetically brings out the sharp intellect and brittle neurosis of Mary in crisp detail. Michael Murphy plays a variation of his cheating husband in \"An Unmarried Woman\" but with far greater depth as Yale. In her breakout year, Meryl Streep, looking austerely beautiful with her long blonde hair cast to one side, has three incisive scenes as Isaac's ex-wife Jill, who has since embarked on a lesbian relationship and writes a tell-all book about their marriage.Ironically, Anne Byrne was just about to go through her own public divorce from Dustin Hoffman when she played Emily at the time. Even Allen manages a few moments of poignancy that transcend Isaac's constant angst. But the jewel of the cast is Mariel Hemingway, who plays Tracy with such a beguiling blend of maturity and naivet\u00e9. As it turns out, her character is the only one who is emotionally available and honest about her feelings. This is still a splendid work, and if you can get past the life-imitating-art-imitating-life analogies, this one will stay with you. And Manhattan never looked better. With a sharp print transfer, the 2000 DVD unsurprisingly has no extras, as with all Allen films, except the original theatrical trailer.",

Its comments on love, life and happiness are right on target. \"Annie Hall\" was funnier but this movie is, in serious matters, better than \"Annie\". Also the b&w and music with the script gives some scenes a very romantic feel (this is a perfect date movie). The picture is spellbinding from start to finish.The actors are just great. Allen is great with the comedy BUT he's not that good of a dramatic actor--some scenes don't work all that well because of this--but they DO work. Keaton is just superb in her role. She's funny, sad, intelligent...and just wonderful. Hemingway was just OK here--but she WAS nominated for an Oscar. Murphy is very good as Davis' best friend and Anne Byrne as his wife is also good (but she's given nothing to do). Also seeing Streep in an early role is fun and Karen Allen appears (unbilled and no dialogue) in a TV show bit. This is a must-see just for the imagery alone--Manhattan itself has never looked this good. A true classic full of wonderful dialogue and one great scene after another. Don't miss this one!Also don't let the R rating fool you--this is pretty tame. There's no nudity, sex or violence and Keaton swears only 3 or 4 times...but having a 42 year old sleep with a 17 year old was pretty extreme for a 1979 movie. It would probably get a PG-13 now.",

            "content": "Any compilation of classic films has to include at least one Woodly Allen movie and this one - which he directed and co-wrote and in which he appears in almost every scene - is one of his best works in a career spanning more than six decades and embracing more than 60 films. Like so many early Allen movies, this is located exclusively in central New York and indeed is a veritable homage to his home town being shot in black and white with a soundtrack from George Gershwin. Again like so many early Allen movies, the core of the narrative is the neuroses of the central character - essentially Allen himself - as explored through his relationships with women.In \"Manhattan\", Isaac is a 42-year-old, twice-divorced, television comedy writer trying to make sense of relationships with his lesbian ex-wife, played by Meryl Streep with very long blonde hair, his 17 year old girlfriend, played quietly by Mariel Hemingway with her distinctive cheekbones and eyebrows, and his best friend's lover, played by big-haired klutzy Diane Keaton (Allen's partner shortly before the making of the film). Looking back at the movie almost 40 years after it was made, one notes how little other high-profile work Hemingway did, how brilliant and long-lasting a career Streep has had, and how the large age gap between Allen's character and his girlfriend seems to anticipate his subsequent relationship with Soon-Yi Previn where there is a 35 year difference.Perhaps, above all, one enjoys and remembers \"Manhattan\" because of the witty and hilarious script - one of Allen's finest. Who else would write lines like this? \"No, I didn't read the piece on China's faceless masses, I was, I was checking out the lingerie ads.\" Or this? \"I dunno, I was just thinking. There must be something wrong with me, because I've never had a relationship with a woman that's lasted longer than the one between Hitler and Eva Braun.\"",

The supporting cast is also really good as it usually is in these kinds of Woody Allen films. The style of the film I also enjoyed with the black and white and great use of shadows gives it a old timey feel to it that helps the film in a way. Overall, Manhattan isn't a bad film, I enjoyed it more than I did Annie Hall, but there were still some things I would've liked to see Woody Allen do differently along the lines of the story and cast.

Manhattan is made to look absolutely beautiful with the help of Gordon Willis' widescreen photography. Allen uses the Black & White visual texture to romanticise New York and make it look like the New York of the movies from the Golden Age of Hollywood. However there lies the deliberate contradiction in the film. Unlike the 'happily ever-after' relationships of Classic Hollywood, in 'Manhattan', in accordance with the running theme in almost every other Woody Allen film, true and long lasting love is almost impossible to find. Similar to his other films, the characters here belong to the intellectual upper/upper-middle class and they are shown to be completely immersed in narcissism. They are lonely, but they choose to hide behind their armour of intellectualism. They want company, but they lose patience and get afflicted with doubt and boredom as soon as the hint of a potentially lasting relationship raises its head. Allen adds to the meta-element in the film by making fun of his own self constantly as the real life Woody Allen too is a part of the intellectual class that he is making fun of in 'Manhattan' and some of the comedic taunts directed at the character of Isaac seem like direct jabs at his own self. The film's ending is pitch perfect as it underlines(without seeming didactic) the need for hopefulness instead of pseudo-intellectual cynicism, a need for a little more faith in romance and a little more faith in humanity, so that the romanticised visuals of New York get to complement instead of contradict the sensibilities of its residents.",

All his best films were set there because like any artist, Mr. Allen finds unexpected sources of inspiration in a place with an unique energy and rhythm of its own. It no surprise the director's own love affair with New York turned out to be his masterpiece.Isaac Davis, a writer, is heard in the background dictating what he think is going to be a great book as the fabulous landmarks of the city are shown in all their splendor as they looked at the time when the movie was done. Then, we are taken to meet Isaac, himself, and his friends, Yale and Emily. Isaac has been dating a seventeen year Dalton student, Tracy, who is clearly in love with him. Isaac, being forty two, is not serious about their future together.As the friends emerge into the Manhattan night, the men paired off, and the women follow them. Yale has a problem; he has been seeing another woman, in what sounds like a serious situation. The next thing Isaac meets Yale at an art exhibit, the mysterious woman appears. Mary is an opinionated lady, who gets exasperated hearing Isaac disagree with her about everything they saw at the gallery, even going as far as insulting Ingmar Bergman, Isaac's own idol.As fate will have it, Mary, in spite of her apparent aversion to Isaac, calls him one Sunday when she is alone and going crazy in her apartment. What begins as a trip to the Planetarium, turns into an intense relationship between Mary and Isaac. Complicating things is Isaac's own attachment to Tracy. He comes to the realization his seeing the young woman is pointless. Tracy gets hurt by Isaac's casualness in dumping her.Isaac's life is going to change because his former wife, Jill, who left him for another woman, is planning a book about her life with Isaac. It upsets him to have all those minute details come out in the open for anyone to read. Jill is adamant, but since they have a son together, he must take care of the boy, in spite of the bitterness the divorce caused him.\"Manhattan\" is a joy to watch. We saw the film when it made its commercial debut. Woody Allen wrote the screenplay with Marshall Brickman. The production was photographed with loving detail in black and white by Gordon Willis, a long time associate of the director. The film is seen through Isaac's eyes, whose take on the city he loves is special. The characters seem real because they come from the world where Mr. Allen knew best. That is why the people and the situations feel so real.Diane Keaton, who plays Mary, also had a close relationship with Mr. Allen. She was his muse, and his love for her shows in the film. This was also one of the best appearances by Woody Allen in any of his own movies. Michael Murphy plays Yale, a good friend and confidant, a man that enjoys walking through the city sharing stories with his pal. Muriel Hemingway is seen as Tracy. Meryl Streep also has a good opportunity to shine with her Jill.\"Manhattan\" is an unforgettable tribute to the city by a man whose love for it never fails.",

However he learns that best friend Michael Murphy is cheating on his wife (Anne Byrne Hoffman) with a cold would-be intellectual (another brilliant turn by Diane Keaton). Allen, totally confused with relationships after his ex-wife (a show-stopping and hilarious role for Meryl Streep) leaves him to be with a woman (Karen Ludwig), is also scared to death of a new tell-all book that Streep is writing about their past marriage. Amazingly Allen and Hemingway seem to be in love though, but Allen will not let the relationship just happen and decides to go after Keaton instead. Once again the neurotic Allen may have over-thought his way out of true happiness. \"Manhattan\" is a movie that shows some of the best things that Allen has to give us as a film-maker, actor and writer (he received an Oscar nod for co-writing the script). He shoots the movie entirely in black and white and has an intense Ira Gershwin soundtrack going throughout. In the end, \"Manhattan\" is really an homage to Allen's New York. The movie also doubles as an intelligent slice of life about individuals wanting love and never quite being able to find it, even when it is right in front of them sometimes.

The heart of the movie is that these people are looking for love against a breathtaking black & white skyline all scored to the romantic grandeur of Gershwin. And it all works...The rain-inspired trip to the museum, the handsome cab ride, the legendary overlook of the 59th street bridge... it's enough to give anyone who's ever been in love or New York City heart palpitations.

You are left unsure whether the director Allen endorses the actor Allen's selfishness or whether he is wryly pointing it out to the audience. As in Stardust Memories, Allen himself anticipates the criticisms that one might make of his character but one is left unsure whether this is insight or egotism. Interestingly, Allen returns to the theme of an older man and a teenage girl in his 1992 film Husbands and Wives but in this latter film, in contrast to his egotism in Manhattan, he is the only character who displays a sense of responsibility.",

The film is about Isaac Davis(Woody Allen), who writes for a TV show, has always had troubles with the women in his life, and is dating a seventeen year old girl named Tracy(Mariel Hemingway). Mary Wilkie(Diane Keaton) is involved in an affair with Issac's friend Yale(Michael Murphy), who is a married man and can't decide who he loves more. Meanwhile, Jill Davis(Meryl Streep) is one of Issac's previous wives(now a lesbian) who is writing a book about her divorce with him. She also has custody of Issac's kid, Will. Anyway, at the beginning of the film we are introduced to these characters rather early and we see them all as pretty flawed people. However, things get a little bit more complicated when one starts to interfere with someone else's love life. It's all quite fascinating to watch and a lot of it is really quite funny. While this is definitely not my favorite Woody Allen film, it is one that I love a lot. I love the beautiful black and white photography as well as the scenes with Issac and Mary, which I would call the highlights of the film. Nobody can write dialogue like Woody Allen. I know millions of other people have said that, but it's true. He's a clever little dude. I really liked the last scene of this film too. It was heartwarming without being sappy.

In Manhattan I've seen first of all the portrait of a generation, the generation of those who lived their forties in Manhattan, the symbol of everything that could be achieved in the 80s. And the portrait depicted is not softened at all, since every single adult in this movie is a neurotic mess. There are adults afraid of cancer, adults that plan to write books they will never end, adults that put their life in the hands of LSD-addicted analysts, adults that talk about orgasms, adults devastated by dull, mediocre men imagined as \"gods\", adults that waver between homo, bi and heterosexuality, adults that pretend to be intellectuals and try to judge Mozart, Bergman and Scott Fitzgerald, adults whose relationships are stable just as the weather is, adults that act like they believe in the highest values but that in the end need a seventeen-year-old girl to find their balance. And those are the same adults that despise the generation brought up by the TV and the pill. This show of absurdities is well hosted by Isaac Davis, Woody Allen himself, that unprejudiced as always, hides all these paradoxical situations behind a good amount of irony. If I had to make a comparison with a more recent movie, I would say that what Allen did with his generation has been done by Tony Servillo with the current fifty-year-old Roman VIPs, in his latest work La Grande Bellezza. Irony, good acting and a good soundtrack always make a movie worth watching. And this movie can boast the best of everything.",

MANHATTAN is arguably one of Woody's best romantic comedies and an upbeat one at that despite the usual suspects of dysfunctional individuals who populate the city. The world of Isaac Davis whirls around the love he feels for an underage girl named Tracy, the love he wants to feel for the acerbic Mary Wilke (Diane Keaton), and the love that has turned sour towards his ex-wife turned lesbian Jill (Meryl Strep) who's written a none-too-flattering book based on their marriage (which makes you wonder not only if her lesbianism is merely an excuse to get out of marriage, but how sane she really is but then again: tell-all books have as of today become a thing of vague interest; back in 1979, they weren't). The story moves around like a loop-de-loop of relations and it foreshadows a remark that another college girl named Rain (Juliette Lewis), one which another Woody character, Gabe Roth, will date in HUSBANDS AND WIVES, will do in criticism of his work and the fact that characters move in and out of relationships with this casualness that is unnatural. But this is the world he lives in, and in a way, this is pretty much how things actually happen -- we just don't see it this way, or choose not to. To top it all, it has the pristine Gershwin score that makes its presence throughout, it's shot in a crystal clear black and white and the only movie he's done in letterbox, and it has the beautiful, radiant performance from Muriel Hemingway as the precocious Tracy -- her scene, where she gets the bad news from Allen, is shot dead-on and is heartbreaking, but she's the only one who is grounded enough to accept things as they are and look forward. One of the most beautiful, nuanced pictures Woody Allen has done.",

Hard to believe Merly Streep, Michael Murphy, Diane Keaton and Wallace Shawn can be so boring, but they are. The teenage Mariel Hemingway outshines this bunch. If you're just starting in on Allen films, pick something better like Deconstructing Harry, Shadows and Fog, or Small Time Crooks. Films lovers will laud his cinematic talents but this black and white film just looks murky most of the time.

Although Annie Hall is a funnier film, and perhaps a lighter and more accessible film (although Manhattan is by no means dark), and perhaps even a more celebrated film, for me Manhattan in the quintessential Allen movie. All the elements are present; Allen's neurotic New Yorker, all intellectual angst; the romanticised Big Apple, swaying to the sounds of George Gershwin, never having looked better than in Gordon Willis' black and white photography; the humorous deconstruction of adult relationships. The film centres around Allen's relationship with the seventeen year old Tracy, which, thanks to a sweet performance by Mariel Hemingway, doesn't come across as inappropriate as it sounds. Keaton is excellent as always as the yin to Allen's yang, and there is good support from Michael Murphy and Meryl Streep.I can understand why Woody Allen is an acquired taste, but what I would say to those who question the man's genius is this; \"you've gotta learn to have a little faith in people\".",

I am willing to entertain the theory that I'm not yet accustomed to his approach, and that this takes some away from the experience. With that said, I simply can't claim that I enjoyed this as much as as Annie Hall. Maybe I missed the thin, hard-to-make-out line between fantasy and reality in that one; it was definitely something I loved about that. I don't know. That one made me laugh to a tremendous extent, and this one barely accomplished so. Perhaps I don't know enough about New York; I get that this is a tribute to the city, and probably to old films set there, and yes, I realize that plenty, maybe most, of the music is indeed Gershwin(I'm sorry, but is it just me who finds it distracting in a couple of places, including important scenes?). Maybe if I \"got\" all the stuff, I'd like it more. The script is well-written, and the drama works. Characters are credible and well-developed. This is intellectual, with countless references to culture. The humor is clever and verbal, with Woody's neurotic ramblings and philosophy making up quite a bit of the material. There is a little mild sexual dialog and strong language in this. The DVD comes with the theatrical trailer. I recommend this to fans of the man behind it. 8/10",

Basically in Manhattan, New York, lives forty-two year old TV show writer Isaac Davis (BAFTA nominated Allen) who divorced his wife Jill (BAFTA nominated Meryl Streep) who is now a lesbian and writing a book about their relationship. Isaac is unhappy with his job and quits it so that he can concentrate on writing a book, and he spends most of his time dating seventeen year old high school student Tracy (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Mariel Hemingway). One day he meets Mary Wilke (Annie Hall's BAFTA nominated Diane Keaton), the mistress of his best friend Yale (Michael Murphy), married to Emily (Anne Byrne Hoffman), Isaac is developing a crush on her. He does not love Tracy like she loves him, and he ends it with her to start an affair with Mary after Yale splits with her. But Yale then splits with his wife and returns to Mary, Isaac is not happy and goes to have his say about the situation, but it doesn't work out to his advantage. Towards the end he thinks to himself about the beautiful face of Tracy, so he goes to find her before she leaves for England, and when he says his feelings, she wishes he could have done it before, he just gives her a slight smile when she leaves. Also starring Karen Ludwig as Connie, Michael O'Donoghue as Dennis, Karen Allen as Television Actor #2 and Wallace Shawn as Jeremiah. Filmed in black and white, it is a really interesting, more linear approach to a romantic comedy, and Allen still brings the same neurotic, paranoid and over thinking nature as Annie Hall. I don't understand why he wouldn't like this film, it is one of his finest works, not just because of the scripting and story, but is also celebrates the sights of Allen's beloved New York. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film and Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Woody Allen was number 71 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 80 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, the film was number 66 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 46 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it was number 10 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die.

I will refrain from commenting on that experience except to note that I (and the three other patrons in the whole theatre) walked out midway through the movie realizing that we should cut our losses and leave.  As college students, our time was not particularly valuable but we had already lost an hour of our lives that we would never get back.Fast forward many years to a sleepless night.  Apparently, HBO or Showtime had acquired this stinker as filler for the 3:00 AM time slot.  Wanting desperately to enter dreamland, I watched the entirety of the meager offering and realized that it was not callow immaturity that had me turn my nose at this dreck many years before.  This is truly a bad movie.  It is filled with the usual self-absorptive navel gazing that any Woody Allen product is famous for but it does it on a scale of grand pretentiousness (eg. b&w, the notion that pubescent girls are attracted to trolls, the waste of otherwise talented people) that dwarfs anything that this Ed Wood impersonator has done before or since.The genius of Woody Allen is not in his \"art\" but in his marketing skill. He has convinced an enormous portion of the \"faux art house\" crowd that his output is somehow sublimely transcendant and that those who view his ego driven made for TV releases are indeed fortunate that he has allowed them to shell out hard earned money time and again for the same story with different faces.  Where was this guy when Coca Cola trotted out New Coke.  He should have been in charge of the ad campaign.Enough general adulation for our diminutive hero.  The movie recounts the threadbare old male fantasy of the older dude getting the young chick and then realizing that older chicks are better lays.  I would swear that Richard Gere has done variations on this movie at least a dozen times. Woodrow is entirely unbelievable in the role of the older dude.  I suppose that he realized the limitations of his performance when he insisted on redoing the movie for free.  In the ensuing decades since its release, Woodrow has worked on various stage versions of this role, culminating in his relationship with his adopted- step- semi- daughter.  I think I speak for most Americans when I say \"eeeeewwwwwwwwww\".At any rate, don't waste money renting Manhattan.  Don't waste time watching it.  Don't think that it will put you to sleep because you will not rest knowing that a good number of people set out to make an acceptable movie and somewhere along the way things went very wrong.",

What Hemingway sees in a forties 4 eyed dwarf (Allen) is a mystery--ahh but love is blind....even so--the story has to be believable at some level. Where were her parents?--wouldn't they object? etc? She is still in high school and presumably living at home or a boarding school.Other reviewers talk of this being a mirror/justification of Allen's real life--In Allen's life obviously normal boundaries were broken-- marrying a daughter by marriage. Girls used to wed at 14 they still do in India--so that is mostly a fizzle in my eyes objected to by people who wish they could pull off the same thing.Keaton as another reviewer wrote, talks like a 15 year old nerd trying to impress with a constant blather of pseudo intellectual garbage that is both unnatural (no one talks like that) and exhausting to listen to. It should have shrivelled up Allen's libido permanently. The worst part of it all is I am not sure Allen didn't think this pseudo intellectual stuff was impressive at some level. His character in the movie does.Allen can be very funny--but about the only time I laughed in this movie is when Allen asks Keaton :\"what kind of analyst calls you at 3 in morning sobbing?\" When he takes himself seriously you realize he is a lightweight and not part of the Manhattan intellectual elite he craves to be....at least I hope not.With the exception of Keaton's aggressive blather the movie is not that bad and watchable.

With disco raging on the top 40, he chose George Gershwin for the compositions on the soundtrack. When very few directors were doing black and white anymore, he decided to do so for a more dramatic effect, and in widescreen format. I love almost everything about this film - its aesthetic, razor sharp script, and the iconic shots like the one of Allen and Keaton sitting in front of the Queensboro Bridge in the early morning. It grabbed me from the start with its absolutely brilliant opening shots, each a work of art on its own, along with Allen's funny narration, and I was smiling to the end.As is often the case in Allen's films, I love how Manhattan both celebrates intellectuals and mocks them. The scenes discussing art, religion, and culture are like candy to me, especially as the references and interesting commentary include satire of those in this world. I also love its feminism. Yes, it was an unfortunate (and highly ironic) choice to make the young girl Allen's character is seeing 17 years old and include all sorts of comments about her being in high school, but she and the other women in the film are smarter than the men and have the most intelligent lines about the things the film deals with. Diane Keaton, Mariel Hemingway, and even Meryl Streep in her small part are all given a chance to shine, and they're great. The ending is perfect to me too - cut at exactly the right moment, and with exactly the right tone for my taste - so I was a little surprised to find Allen was unhappy with it.

This sets the mood for the story about a man who is wants happiness but fails to find it. Nothing he does brings him joy. He hates his job, gest involved in hopelessly morbid relationships, deceives himself into believing that his so-called friends actually care about him, and is incapable of showing real anger. He feels rage but cannot let it out. Instead he directs his rage against himself by repeatedly putting himself in social situations in which he allows others to humiliate him. Now, what makes this movie so wacky is that it is billed as a comedy. This movie is supposed to be funny, clever, witty and arguably Woody Allen's best movie. This dark movie is anything but funny. The main character, Isaac, played by Allen, is suffering. Isaac is so lacking in self-esteem and so determined to punish himself for wanting to be happy that he gets involved with a high school girl. And the moment the girl indicates she cares for him, he pushes her away. Only belatedly does he realize what he has done, but by that time it is too late. he has lost her. He suffers another rejection from a woman who is the mistress of his married best friend. Isaac deludes himself into believing that this woman, who is fickle and emotionally flighty, cares about him. When he shows that he cares about her, she dumps him. She is utterly incapable of commitment. But the worst blow to Isaac's already shredded ego occurs when he is forced to realize that his best friend, Yale, the one person who Isaac believes really cares about him as a human being, and who Isaac idolizes, is a self-centered narcissist who uses people. And remember: this is supposed to be a comedy. Where is Laurel and Hardy and Abbott and Costello for comic relief when we need them? The thing about this movie that makes it so unique is that it attempts to present self-loathing as a form of humor. One cannot help but feel sympathy for Isaac who really deserves better treatment.

Those comedic moments that stem from character, some pinching, intelligent and fast paced dialogue. This is a biting satire to personal issues: about being stagnant and confused about life, about being superficial and vain, about survival in a big city, about finding each's own happiness.My favorite part about the film was the gorgeous cinematography and how the city is centered into spotlight, with jazzy overlays such as \"Rapsody in Blue\" by Gershwin - what a beautiful music. It made me miss a city I was never part of or even visited, in a time I was not even alive. Woody loves Manhattan and you can feel it. Sure, the depiction leaves a rather picture postcard impression of the city, but I suppose ... this is the way he sees it. This is his love. Much of the film appears to have been shot at either sunrise or sunset to soften the light, and there are spectacular views of the towers, bridges and waterways of America's finest metropolis. Beautiful views, just gorgeous!I guess, the experience about the city and the great images made me love what I'd could not deal with in other Woody-films. There's the jazz, the choice between stable and highly-strung women, the self-mocking humor (hilariously done in an opening voice-over, which made me want to see the whole film), the raging against intellectual snobbery ... and overall the neurotic, unsympathetic lead (which is usually my reason to not like woody-films). But in this case: I felt with him, I understood his ugly pain in this overall beautiful city - why? Still not sure.I was in love with the performances: Diane Keaton is great as Mary, the bridge between two love triangles - vain, pretentious and yet you can understand why Isaac falls for her. Special mention must go to Meryl Streep. I was surprised to see her so young and so beautiful - I was just in awe.Overall, this film has a huge nostalgic, tragic, deeply-human and highly relatable vibe (even though most of the characters seem to be unlikable at first) ... and as a sucker for romantic depictions of PLACES...the memories of this film (and its cityscape) will stay with me forever.",

            "content": "Isaac mirrors more of Allen's personality than any other character he played. It's the medium of Woody's soul allowing him to say that \"Bergman is the only genius of Cinema\" and to express his contempt toward \"pseudo-intellectual\" stuff, like an alibi against his detractors. But Woody doesn't deny his flaws, his character represents the struggle of a soul trying to embody Manhattan's incarnation of the American Dream, but as he stutters in the opening line, unable to pass 'Chapter One', he can't find inspiration. His friend Yale (Michael Murphy) says he's got a \"Freudian\" relationship with New York, it's more than that, it's Oedipian because he knows he's in love with this city, but is incapable to make himself worthy of that love. But Manhattan is more than a movie about love; it's about the strange effect of love in mature people. And Isaac, like Woody is mature age-wise of course.Isaac is 42, and he realizes it's an interesting age where his mind became his greatest asset, and since he evolves in an artistic milieu, he's clearly in his advantage. Through \"Manhattan\" and Gershwin's music, it's the whole intellectual and artistic underground world of New York that lets its soul implode, it's to New York what Saint-Germain was to Paris in the existentialist 50's. But in the 70's, New York became the center of the underground culture, of sexual liberation, of the whole questioning of the American heritage without the idealism of the late 60's or the pessimism of the post-Nixon era. Everything is debatable, war, marriage, orgasms and nothing is to be taken for granted. The film was made in 1979.",

With superb cinematography and lighting, I doubt it has looked more beautiful and captivating in any other movie. Vivacious and full of life, it looks like a place where there's always something to do and it makes me want to go there to be a part of it, at least for a while.Woody Allen does a great job of narrating using humour and sarcasm. 'Manhattan' has a very 'Annie Hall' feel to it in terms of its whimsical treatment and quirky characters. I must say I laughed out loud at the irony of his on screen relationship with 17-year-old Mariel Hemingway especially when he stresses on the age difference. Perhaps it's the whole life imitating art (in his case) since in real life, after two failed marriages, he married his ex-partner's daughter who is about 30 years younger than him.Allen himself is his usual self. Diane Keaton is terrific. Meryl Streep is sizzling hot. Mariel Hemingway is a revelation. Her performance is so nuanced and restrained that it wouldn't have even occurred to think that a newcomer is performing. Some brilliant performances indeed but the real star of 'Manhattan' is Manhattan.'Manhattan' is both a visual treat and a cinematic delight. It's a stunning look at the 70s urban culture (that is also brilliantly contrasted in 'Annie Hall'). 'Annie Hall' included with the hippie culture while 'Manhattan' revolves around the metro city culture. It's a tribute to Manhattan and its people.",

Manhattan is no exception and what's nice about it is its personal and intimate slant towards the characters, it perfectly zooms into their psyche and temperament to the point where the spectator is extended to the story as he finds himself apprehending these characters, their insecurities, goodness, and qualities the same way he knows his family and close friends, but here it only takes him one hour and a half to get into their spirit. The film is also a take on the complexity of human relationships and ou fear of happiness. for example, every character keeps finding himself a justification to avoid the confrontation happiness and settling with the image they have of it for fear of getting hurt like Isaac who keeps using Tracey age as an argument to avoid commitment with her and yale using his marriage as an excuse to prevent himself from consuming his love for Marry....it's also a portrayal of how chaotic and immature adult life can be juxtaposing it with the maturity of its youngest character Tracey, a mirror of our turbulent and uncontrolled lives, and the way we disregard the happiness sitting right next to us. That's what good cinema is about; letting you see the bigger picture and detach from your universe, all this narrated and showcased in a border poetic black and white New-york, which is its most complete and definite dress.",

In an hour and a half of this drama, imbued with his characteristic eccentric humor, which often causes discomfort rather than laughter, Allen portrayed realistic characters who, in an unsuccessful search for their own identity and fulfillment, run away from themselves through relationships. Of course, for the characters to be convincing, it is not enough just to be well written, but the performances of Allen himself in the lead role, Diane Keaton, Michael Murphy, Mariel Hemingway, and Meryl Streep do not lag behind. Add that to the beautiful black-and-white photography and music of George Gershwin performed by the New York Philharmonic led by Zubin Mehta, and we get a timeless classic.

Except for the romanticizing of the city via the look of the film, there is zero romance to any of these relationships. I will never be able to suspend disbelief at the idea, in many of Allen's films where he plays the main character, that he's somehow such an attractive Casanova that he gets himself into these predicaments to begin with. His characters are such annoying, whiny-voiced trolls. The humor is low-key, nothing laugh-out-loud funny, but a few chuckles. It's the kind of movie pseudo-intellectuals write and give glowing reviews of, but for the rest of us it's just a big shrug.

But that aside, the movie just wasn't as funny as Annie Hall, It made me smirk once in a while, but no scene made me truly laught out loud, I also thought that Woody's character here was even more annoying than in Annie Hall. I was also expecting far more of the cinematography, every review I read of this movie stated that the cinematography is magnificent, a masterpiece, but aside from the great opening, which I admit it was marvelous, I feel like the movie didn't show that much of Manhattan at all, I was definitely expecting more on the visual deparmtment.Overall as I said, not a bad movie, but I was definitely expecting much more from the great reviews that I read before watching the movie.

When she's away and staying at Allens home, where is the dog? Does she have a dog walker or keeper. Things like this should be explained. Another nit-picker is that of the character of his 17 year old girl friend. She's under age for heaven sake which makes him a pervert. No one takes note of that. And where oh where are her parents? She's out a night...stays with him overnight, yet nothing is said of her parents. Don't they wonder or even ask where she's been all the time?

It's incredibly hard to get past that and enjoy the movie.Manhattan does a lot of things right from a technical perspective. The camera work and shots are gorgeous and the subject matter of a 70's New York is cozy and romantic. However, the characters in this film fall flat for me.

And this is one of his best, which I have just seen again, and it is as fresh as when it was made. He wrote this clever and poignant script jointly with Marshall Brickman, an old chum of Woody's who wrote SLEEPER (1973) and ANNIE HALL (1977), and later wrote MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY (1993), thus being a Woody collaborator for more than 20 years. (Strangely, Brickman has written three feature films with Manhattan in the title, since he also wrote a serious film about the making of the atom bomb, THE MANHATTAN PROJECT, in 1986, which was very good. Some people just can't escape the island, even to get as far as Brooklyn.) The schoolgirl girlfriend of Woody, Tracy, is played by the 18 year-old Mariel Hemingway, with charming innocence. She matured into a very interesting 'grownup', and I am one of those who bewailed the failure to continue the wonderful TV series CENTRAL PARK WEST (1995), in which she starred, leaving us all holding our breath after 13 episodes and never getting to find out what happened next. Until MAD MEN, it was one of the finest drama series ever done on American television. Tisa Farrow has a very funny bit part and a good comic line. Former New York Congresswoman and leading feminist Bella Abzug, who was famous at that time (she died in 1998), appears briefly as herself, which caused a stir at the time. Today probably few remember her, but whether you were in agreement with her political views or not, all agreed she was one of the great 'characters' of the political scene of those days. Diane Keaton is wonderfully, comically neurotic, and as brilliant as ever. Woody himself stops wisecracking long enough from time to time to show real pathos, especially at the end. Meryl Streep, with long silky hair and a long sulky face, has a rather thankless role as his vicious ex-wife. Is there anyone who has not seen this film? The film has the usual great gags and 'oh, that hurts!' satire running all the way through. It is also an Ode to New York, luxuriating in wonderful shots of some of Woody's favourite views of his favourite city. The music of Gershwin is used throughout, and one of the classic scenes of American cinema is near the beginning where 'Rhapsody in Blue' reaches a crescendo just as fire works explode from the Manhattan skyline at night. The film is really a love letter to New York written, directed, and acted with passion by all of them. The whole cast and the whole gang were young and full of joie de vivre, and it shows. This film will never age. It is still 17, like Tracy, and it will never grow up. And thank God for that.",

Allen plays his usual character, a wise-cracking neurotic who likes to date younger women. The object of his affection here is played expertly by Mariel Hemingway, who indeed was only 17 when filming began. While it is a fine film about relationships and the difficulty thereof, it seems to be certainly overrated, compared to other fine films. It also requires one to enjoy the typical Woody Allen dialog, which achieves a certain sameness from movie to movie. Many will explicitly NOT enjoy an endless stream of it.  I like it most of the time, however it DOES get tiresome. Still, a good story.However, my favorite Allen movie remains \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" which to me stands above all his others.

            "content": "\"Manhattan\" is an American movie from 1979, so this one has its 40th anniversary this year. It was directed and co-written by Woody Allen, who also plays Isaac, the central character. Despite how old it already is, this is not one of Allen's earliest works by any means. He was already in his 40s at that point and so was his character. It is a black-and-white movie and while I usually like these, it did not make too much of an impact on me here that there was no color. But there are enough other reasons why people should watch and will most likely appreciate this film. It is also not really where the movie is set. Honestly, it could have been in all kinds of other places than New York and the story and impact would not have been any different. There is only a brief reference towards the end when we hear Isaac give a certain quote that basically refers to his own writing, but obviously can also be understood as a reference to the characters in this movie made by Allen himself. Yes, Isaac is a writer. But it does not really matter too much. We find out about the characters' professions and job backgrounds only because they are linked to their relationships with each other. This is really typical Allen overall. There is no character development, hardly any changes away from these relationships. The few changes there are like the young girl's ambitions to move to London are only included because they are really relevant in terms of her relationship with the protagonist. But on the other side, there is so much going on in terms of relationships from beginning to end that it almost seems too much for a film with this running time.Allen recast his muse Diane Keaton for a supporting role here not too long after the Annie Hall triumph. Also this movie here takes place in New York. Then there is Meryl Streep around the time when she won her first Oscar when she was barely 30. Anne Byrne Hoffman does not have too much screen time, but she does fine with what she was given I think. The only other male in here with more screen time than a few seconds is Michael Murphy who plays the protagonist's best friend, but also a rival. But the one who deserves the biggest mention is the really young Mariel Hemingway who was just as young as the character she played, namely 17/18. Today they would have cast a 23-year-old actress I suppose, but not back then. She is really tremendous and I am glad she received an Oscar nomination for her portrayal and as she did not have much precursor attention, it looks like a sweet surprise. I think she was better than big names Streep and Keaton and that says quite something. Certainly the role of her lifetime, the mix of a Lolita character with an innocent schoolgirl crushing on a much older man, but really more of the latter. She was a complete scene stealer every time she was on and there is a reason why she gets the last scene of the movie (apart from the first scene too). The break-up scene is really heartbreaking, the final departure scene is pretty memorable too and this was when I decided that this film deserves more than three stars out of five. Without her, I probably would not have given four. Also a really cool and likable character with her acting background and film knowledge. She is just as sweet as it gets. We also only see the film from Ike's perspective and everybody is gentle about this relationship. You could definitely wonder what they were talking behind his back about it. As for her character and her relationship to Ike, it is a constant up and down. Pay attention to how he even forgets her 18th birthday. Really sad stuff. It may sound funny how he says she talks like Jerry's cousin, but it is kinda disrespectful if we take a closer look because he knows about her insecurities in terms of age and still says stuff like that, but she is really crazy about him. No idea why though.I would say that Allen here plays a pretty unlikable character and even if he does not deserve all the hate and lies he is getting (like mostly from Streep's character), you also never really feel sorry for him, for example also when the woman leaves him after earlier saying she sees a man in him who could be the father of her children. And still she goes back to the married husband who eventually decides to leave his wife for her. Now back to the final scene: Even the 18-yo eventually steps up for herself and honestly I am so glad he did and it was a bit of a happy ending. It was also really desperate by Allen's character trying to convince her to stay in New York after what he said earlier, namely that she absolutely should leave. It could ruin her future honestly if she gave up on that great study opportunity. But he sure is a bit of an egomaniac. Still he gets played by everybody somehow in the end. But his reaction is not aggressive. Aggression is not really a factor in this film. It would have been in many others with similar story lines. But it would also have felt a bit unusual for Allen, at least back then.Instead, it is all about swallowing it and trying to make the most of it. We won't know what happens after half a year. Will Ike have found somebody else and lost interest in the girl again? Will she have found somebody in London and decide to stay there? Possible. But maybe they really end up as a couple after this half year, even if at least from Ike's perspective I just cannot see him stay faithful for years if not decades. I mean let's just imagine that Keaton's character expressed an interest in him again. I think he would go back to her right away somehow. It's all open. Everything is possible. Aside from that, as most other times with Allen, this film is really dialogue-driven, some truly smart moments in here and I can see why this was nominated for an Oscar. Not undeservingly. Certainly not a case of oh it's Allen again, he always writes good scripts, so just give him another nod. He deserves it. I also don't really care about his private affairs and love life and if you take that as a reason to strip yourself off the experience of seeing this movie, then you are making a mistake. You don't have to like him as a human. I mean you don't even know him as a human. Just try to appreciate his art. And there is really a great deal of it he left us and is still coming up with in his 80s now. This one here is definitely a contender for his best career effort. I enjoyed it a lot at times. Go watch it and pay attention to how really this is such an open-minded film when it comes to all kinds of unusual romantic involvements (not today anymore, but back in the 1970s for sure). Also a great watch to check out with your significant other.",

With two bold strokes apparent from the opening minutes: black and white cinematography and Gershwinn's Rhapsody in Blue on the soundtrack as fireworks blaze across the city's skyline - Woody casts a spell as powerful and romantic as a film can give us. The opening glow lingers for the rest of the movie as his character stumbles through his crazy-quilt patchwork of relationships - until he is finally stopped in his tracks by the simple, innocent kindness and wisdom of Mariel Hemingway's character. Is it possible for someone not attracted to urban life to flip for this movie? What would a rural fellow or lass make of such a hymn of praise to our great metropolis? And to think Woody made this in the 70's when NYC was not the relatively safe place it is these days. And what sort of story does he tell here? Is it about politics, crime, any number of socially relevant issues? No, it's a Woody Allen movie, so it's a romantic comedy - with one important difference. It's the greatest one ever made.",

            "content": "Manhattan is Woody Allen's tribute to his city. His love of New York is a constant factor throughout his work, and here it is crystallised. Shot in black and white, the excellent photography has a retro feel that captures the city in the classic monochrome style that suits NYC so well. While it recalls the imagery of 1940's movies Manhattan is hardly a retrogressive film. It's chief strength is the way is combines the classic visual presentation and George Gershwin tunes with a modernist approach. The way it lovingly incorporates New York locations into its story about angst-ridden urban types. The narrative about a set of New Yorkers struggling with the complexity of human relationships is rich in characterisations, replete with wit and is overall a considerably sophisticated urban comedy-drama.Manhattan is often compared to Annie Hall, although in my view it doesn't reach the standard of that comedy classic. It is though a much more conventionally structured film than the non-linear and wildly inventive techniques used in that earlier film. On the other hand Manhattan has a more realistic approach that the more conventional narrative benefits. Although this doesn't mean that the film is overly serious. Hardly. Allen himself has many funny lines, and the comedy in general is very good. Its just that its central story of infidelity and the difficulties of male/female relationships is one that has a few serious minded moments that gives pause for thought.Overall, Manhattan is Woody Allen's most visually striking film. His most cinematic. It benefits a lot from being experienced on the big screen. It isn't his best but its amongst his best. Its the point where he started making serious but funny comedy-dramas. And of course its a love letter to Manhattan that skilfully incorporates many of the locations on that island into its story in a way that celebrates them independently of the narrative. If you have any love of this amazing city, you could do worse than try Manhattan.",

            "content": "Woody Allen's Manhattan is proof that the smallest things do in fact make a film great, even when they're put to use in a projects that seems as if it could do no wrong. To put it simply, this is a glorious film, that utilizes character development, poignancy, deep thought, personal flaws, and love to tell a story that is one for the history books of cinema.The film focuses on forty-two year old, comedy writer Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) who is going out with seventeen year old Tracy (Mariel Hemingway). Tracy views their relationship as a precocious one that is directly built off of love. Isaac views it as a passing diversion that will soon be forgotten by the both of them. Isaac feels as if he is the last thinking man in a world that is made up of a cesspool of idiots and pseudo-intellectual mouthbreathers. He winds up meeting Mary Wilkie (Diane Keaton), who rubs him the wrong way at first, but eventually begins to grow on him for her the intelligence she provides and the waves of passion that seemingly flow off her body.Isaac still continues his relationship with Tracy, even though, at this point, why bother? He personally believes it will go nowhere. Tracy clings to hope that it will go somewhere and frets over the idea it won't and, in the end, feels as if she will soon be facing a dark inevitability of life. The only thing seemingly stopping Isaac from going all the way with Mary is that she is currently dating his friend Yale (Michael Murphy) is dating her. But, then again, it doesn't stop him so much to become romantically invested with her, spending all the time in the world and even having sex; so what is exactly stopping him.This is when Manhattan becomes one of the most involved pictures Allen has ever made. Nothing is truly stopping Isaac, but he is paranoid over small details and sees most everything as either trivial (his relationship with Tracy) or effectively makes it achieve a level of intimacy and success that cannot be passed (his relationship with Mary). Isaac wants his relationship with Mary to pass unfathomable heights that may not exist in reality, and his attachment to Tracy is one out of pure convenience. He is in dire need of a wake up call.Not many filmmakers could portray a relationship between a forty-year-old and a teenager to such great power and believability, and with Woody Allen's reputation as of now, one entering this picture blindly could base the premise too much on reality. The fact is he does a brilliant job taking a controversial subject into light. The scene at the diner between Isaac and Tracy, among many other things, is terrific and captivating and accentuates truly what Allen is about in making deeply involved human dramas.Combine the plot and character elements of the film with amazing black and white photography by Gordon Willis and an amazingly elegant score by George Gershwin and you have a picture that delights on every level for your senses. It's extremely rare a film hit many areas of a film on the head with such confidence and style, but Woody Allen's Manhattan does it and does it boldly, making this one of the best romantic films I have yet to see.Starring: Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Mariel Hemingway, and Michael Murphy.

            "content": "Woody Allen is a great director, and Manhattan is his masterpiece. It's a bitingly funny, touching romantic comedy and a two-faced paean to Woody's hometown. Annie Hall might steal the spotlight but, for me, Manhattan is the cream of Woody Allen's crop. Watching Manhattan, you become aware of just how much Woody loves these characters and this city--especially in his refusal to idealize them. Everyone has their foibles, as does the city, but they're all drawn with remarkable care. Yes, Yale is a lout and Isaac is narcissistic, but we, like Woody, like them anyway because they're just human and, in fact, they mean well. The city too is not perfect, but it has its perfect aspects. I feel as though there are nerves laid bare, and I feel closer to the filmmaker in Manhattan. Annie Hall is wonderful and sophisticated for a romantic comedy, but it incorporates too many gags typical of Allen's earlier films. While something like sneezing on a coke-mirror is funny, it seems out of place among the complex emotions and bittersweet tales in Annie Hall. Allen's gags are always funny, but they worked better in the overall narratives of movies like Bananas and Sleeper and Take the Money and Run. Manhattan, I think, eschews those types of laughs for something more mature and satirical. There are laughs and gibes, but they seem more organic inasmuch as they more or less come out of Woody's mouth. The jokes appear as part of his character and not like something added onto the movie to make it funnier. Oh, and it's probably the most wonderfully shot of Allen's films. Allen is an auteur, but you feel his presence not through any visual characteristics of his films--you feel it in story and character types. Manhattan is gorgeous to watch; it makes Manhattan magical. Maybe it's just because it was shot in black-and-white (Gordon Willis, the cinematographer, also shot Annie Hall and Interiors, among other Allen films). No, I don't think that's it. Manhattan takes its time studying the landscape; it looks beyond the characters. There are sweeping vistas that add a dimension to this film different from Allen's other movies--a sense of geography and place. Annie Hall, for all its east coast vs. west coast barbs, was never terribly concerned with landscape. As the title of this film makes plain, the city becomes a central figure in the story of the various love affairs we encounter on screen. All in all, this is a great little gem and one that you should see if you like Woody Allen, romantic comedies, or, really, movies.",

            "content": "\"Manhattan\" was always one of those movies I admired more than I liked. I had seen it several times, the first being when I was 14, and had always found the relationship between Tracy and Isaac uncomfortable to watch, the characters far less well-drawn than in Allen's best work, and the film great to look at but lacking in much else.Well, it's been a few years since I saw it last and I'd like to think that I've matured as a person and in terms of my appreciation for film and understanding of it. So what do I think of \"Manhattan\" now? Well, it looks even more gorgeous than I remember, with the cinematography by Gordon Willis really standing out to me this time. It's possibly his best work (which is saying something given his credentials), and it is only enhanced by Allen's wonderful shot compositions and beautiful portraits of the Manhattan skyline. I did notice this time that most of the outdoor shooting seems to have taken place during sunrise or sunset, which helps give the city the ethereal, mythic quality Allen was going for with the black and white aesthetic (a point made very clear in the narration at the start of the film). The images here are wonderful, evocative, and just beautiful.I'll gladly admit that I'm attracted to good-looking 17 year olds, but I'm still in my twenties and if I'm forty-two and still have the same feelings I would never consider dating someone that age simply out of responsibility (the 'love is ageless' argument would work if it was actually love, but I don't think there's much of that in this particular case). That's a problem a lot of people have with this film, and it was one of my major issues with it as well, especially given that Isaac repeatedly refers to her as a child and recognizes her immaturity. It's one of the reasons that this aspect of the film will never work for me. I always understood what Allen was going for with the character (that the relationship was meant to be a reflection of Isaac's own immaturity and dependency on childish impulses, as is pointed out in the final scene with him telling Tracy \"don't be so mature!\"), but it still disturbs me slightly, and I'll never be able to get past that. The rest of the film I'm fine with, but even the rest of the script is nowhere near as accomplished as Allen could be. Allen has always seen this film as one of his weaker efforts, and I can understand why (although I wouldn't necessarily agree). It's a fairly shallow script with fairly shallow characters, and the film works better as visual spectacle than anything else. Sure, its psychological subtext is sharp and perceptive at times, and it's quite funny, hilarious in places even, but it's not a great screenplay overall. It should be, but it isn't, probably because it simply doesn't work as a romance. Isaac may not be intended to be a pleasant character (I'm fairly certain Allen intended him to seem like the whiny bitch he is), but when you're building a dramedy around a character you should make the character interesting. Isaac may be a well-drawn character with some depth, but he's also just a completely uninteresting person, and he has nothing to add to the film, despite being the central character.\"Manhattan\" is a good film. Nearly excellent, in fact. There are too many flaws for me to ignore, though, and although I'll always enjoy the stunning images set to Gershwin and the generally wonderful performances, there's always that script that's so perceptive and smart and creative in places, but so flawed and hackneyed in others that it gets frustrating to witness this flawed gem that could have so easily been a masterpiece.7.5/10",

Then there's his best friend Yale, who is definitely married, but having an affair with an attractive single woman, who desires Isaac but is attracted to Yale. Although he states he loves her, he can't commit to a divorce from his wife Mary (Diane Keaton) whom he does not want to leave. Tracy (Mariel Hemingway) plays a 17 year-old who claims she's in love with Isaac, but rebuffed, despite the fact he's had sex with her.

Arranged as a love letter to both the city he calls home and the George Gershwin music that colors his memories (they're each as much a character as any flesh-and-blood person onscreen), and shot in gorgeous black and white by Gordon Willis, it's one of Woody's finest films in terms of visuals and music alone; that it's also a perceptive and witty character examination is the icing on the cake. Keaton is the mistress of the best friend (Murphy) that Woody falls for; Hemingway is the patient and sophisticated seventeen-year-old student he's involved with at the outset (arguably the more mature one in the couple); Streep is his ex-wife writing a tell-all book about their relationship.

(Even at 44, W.A. reminds one of the 14-year-old dweeb in junior high that you could never seem to ditch.)Oh, \"Manhattan\" has its redeeming moments: here and there a few lovely shots of New York City (done in beautiful black and white), plus some great excerpts of Gershwin tunes (a *soundtrack listing here on IMDb would have been nice - in the music credits section of the movie, the print was so tiny I couldn't read the titles!). But other than that, this film is a hodge-podge of neurotic, uninteresting, dysfunctional and unlikable people, all engaged in either outright illicit romantic activities, or just unconventional ones; oh, and they like to go to museums and theater and other artsy activities.And if Woody Allen seems childish in this film, then Mariel Hemingway, his teenage girlfriend, comes across as almost infantile. Makes one wonder why the vice squad didn't confiscate all copies of this film.So do yourself a favor and don't watch this film unless you want to be annoyed for about an hour and a half of your life. Don't watch it unless you like to see 40-something nerds shack up with teenage girls.

I think this film could really work for people who are into Rom Coms.What I disliked: I think it expects you to sympathise with the characters but I didn't at all. Woody Allen's character is extremely self absorbed and unlikable, and the other characters are pretentious. That's a big problem as you're supposed to see yourself in Woody Allen's character and sympathise with him but I despised him. This lead to me having no connection or interest in the relationships. It follows a pretty cookie cutter romantic comedy plot, whether or not this was original at the time i'm not sure, but it's definitely not the first romantic comedy so I doubt it. I also didn't find it funny for the most part but then I don't find much funny.

Whether it be a brilliant opening scene giving the viewer an idea of what is to follow or a fantastic opening monologue, Woody Allen has the ability to bring me into his films in their opening seconds like no other filmmaker can. Manhattan opens with that signature perfect voice- over narration that I am starting to associate with Woody Allen. Manhattan was my 6th outing with the auteur and one that I am immeasurably thankful for. There was a time in my life before I saw Manhattan and the time of my life after I saw Manhattan; the line distinguishing those two points in my life is becoming quite clear. There's nothing I like more than watching a film and knowing immediately it is going to have a profound impact on your life as a cinephile. I rarely have that experience with most films making themselves known as turning points in my life long after their credits roll. Manhattan was the 1979 installment of prolific director Woody Allen's film-a-year career. Detailing the feelings of love's uncertainty in a remarkably down to earth way, Manhattan is beautiful in no small part to its simplicity.Isaac (Woody Allen) is a forty-something writer who has a better romantic relationship with his hometown of Manhattan than he ever has with a woman in his life. Isaac is currently carrying on a relationship with a 17-year old girl that he is only half invested in because he sees the relationship as doomed to fail due to their age difference. His partner Tracy (Mariel Hemingway), however, is fully invested in their romance and realizes that she is falling in love with Isaac. After dealing with an ex-wife who divorced Isaac after realizing she was a lesbian deciding to write a book about their marriage, quitting his job as a writer for a television comedy, and believing he may be romantically interested in the woman his best friend is having an affair with, Isaac ends his relationship with Tracy in hopes of a revelation through self- discovery and a relationship with a woman his age. Isaac soon realizes that there does not exist one universal formula for a successful life, and even if there did, he probably wouldn't be satisfied with it.Woody Allen is one of my favorite filmmakers. The way he can weave a story through a theme of the uncertainty of the self and the meaning of life has always pleased this existentialist. Woody Allen manages to bring these issues to every film I've seen of his thus far in a new and innovative way which has inspired me to work my way through his entire filmography. What I was not prepared for before I watched Manhattan was how beautiful of a film Woody Allen is capable of. There are certain themes one conjures up when considering Woody Allen, among them, neurotic Jewish characters, self-aware nervous individuals, death, and bitingly quick film writing. I was pleasantly surprised just how gorgeous Manhattan was. Making the decision to shoot the film in black and white and providing subtly brilliant shots shows Allen's prowess as a director. Certain shots have stayed with me since I finished the film two days ago, for instance, the lighting in the planetarium scene when Isaac is trying to decide how he feels about his new muse, the shot through the blinds when Isaac is on the phone, Tracy sitting on the couch in the left corner of the screen as Isaac descends a set of stairs from the right corner of the screen, the shot of the couple on Isaac's television show seen arguing through wires from the ceiling, and of course the iconic shot of the Queensboro Bridge which adorns the film's poster, are all images that are beautiful in what they convey in each moment of the film--and images I can't forget. Woody Allen asks a serious question in Manhattan--\"What makes life worth living\", well, part of my answer is: Woody Allen films.",

They all worked well together and were very believable, even Hemingway as nice, a little na\u00efve teenager who is somehow in a relationship with a man 25 years her senior. Streep role was small but was the professional she always is and Keaton was very different to her role in Annie Hall.When compared to Allen's previous film Annie Hall Manhattan is much more grounded and it is more of a drama then a comedy. There are some funny lines but they are much sparer. But there are some comparisons to Annie Hall, we have similar characters like Yale being a little like Rob in Annie Hall and Allen continues his assault on both mainstream TV comedy and pretentiousness. Like Annie Hall attacks Allen pretentious intelligentialism when talking about art and Allen has a continued love for Ingmar Bergman: but Allen's character is equally as pretentious as Mary yet he gets a free pass.Isaac comes up across as a very selfish and narcissistic character, he only cared about himself and willing to step over other people for his interests. All the characters selfish as they have affairs with each other and want to have the best of both worlds, like Yale who wants Mary whilst stay with his wife. SPOILER: I felt that Isaac's wanting to be with Tracey at the end was a very selfish and basically picked because he just wanted to be with somewhere. Only Tracey comes off in a good light because she has an idealised view of romance and relationships, willing to do anything for Isaac before gaining experience and knowledge from the relationship.I can see why people do like the film but I personally felt it was overrated. Compared to Annie Hall Manhattan lacked heart and passion and felt a much colder film. It is higher to sympathise with the characters in this looser narrative that film has to offer.",

            "content": "(Minor spoilers ahead) Actually, it's needless to say anything on both the story, it's characters, it's actors, their performance, cinematography, dialogs and so on, since the status of Manhattan as a classic cannot be doubted. What makes this film special is that it not only combines Allens great wit as actor, director and screenwriter with the congenial music of Gershwin and the black and white pictures of New York; it will stay with the viewer for it's deep melancholy that accompanies the characters throughout the film. How often does it happen that a comedy - and especially one concerning love, relationship, break-ups - is presented in such an intelligent, memorial and funny, but yet serious way? Hardly ever. Allen does not try to depict realistic relations, but instead delivers a sort of modern urban fairy tale in which the characters try their various strategies to cope with life - all of them behaving in their very own way. Allens character Isaac, who is totally different to that of Michael Murphy, playing his friend Yale; and yet, it's no less different to the other persons in close relation to him. Keaton and Allen become close by being the total opposite, a difference which seems to vanish, only to return in the end. Tracey, Mariel Hemingways character, in her young age is different again, not matching with Isaacs interests or perspectives, nor is his ex-wife, played by Meryl Streep. Still there is a connection. Still Allen manages to create an atmosphere in which it all fits together. Although this review may sound much more serious that the film actually is, I couldn't finish it without declaring the final scene one which will be kept in your memory as a outstanding achievement. It captures all the melancholy presented in the pictures, dialogs and music in a few minutes time. If the genre 'love comedy' exists, then this scene alone makes Manhattan the number one on my scale for that category.",

            "content": "Woody Allen is associated with self-deprecating humor, usually linked with his Jewish identity. However, in this movie he moves away from those themes and instead offers a plot that is not only humorous but deals with themes that can resonate with any audience. The story shows what how people can make a lot of half-baked decisions when their thinking is muddled. These decisions can cause a lot of damage and destroy friendships. For instance, Allen lauds the island of Manhattan while at the same time including scene after scene of a city that is grimy, dark, foreboding, and unfriendly, evidence of the kind of conflictual perceptions that mark the thinking of all of the characters. Filming the movie in black and white adds to the sense of emotional disconnection; there is simply nothing beautiful or charming about the city. The panoramic vistas are impressive but cold and foreboding, yet this is the venue where all the characters function. This movie contains what is probably Diane Keaton's greatest performance. She is clearly the star of the movie. If anyone has any doubt as to her talent as an actress, this movie will dispel those doubts. In this movie, Woody Allen is attempting to make a statement about the human condition and succeeds. This movie shows that people can hurt one another without meaning to do so and that the quest for personal happiness is a difficult road.",

I found the effort somewhat strained but I did like the views of Manhattan at night and the drive along Riverside Drive with the Upper West Side glowing in the background. Beyond the striking visual impressions, we have another Woody Allen take on the trials and tribulations of people, as they move in and out of relationships. This movie was written by Allen and shows his usual sardonic sense of humor as he portrays Isaac Davis, whose ex-wife Jill (Meryl Streep) has ''left me for another woman\", as he puts it. This situation leaves Isaac even more humiliated. The male-baiting gives the movie some extra spark, particularly the hilarious accusation about Isaac's trying to run down Jill's new partner. Then there is Jill's pending book about their failed marriage, including their sex life, which he believes all his friends will be reading. The break-up is made worse by his loss of the custody of his child, who will now have to deal with two mothers, when one is enough of an albatross, as he puts it. Into the void, Isaac has struck up a serious friendship with a teenager named Tracy (Mariel Hemingway), who is twenty- five years younger. Mariel Hemingway is the essence of teenage innocence in this film and while we know she is much too young, we see her as a fragile presence who has helped Isaac get through the rough spots. He moves on to another woman named Mary (Diane Keaton) who has been abandoned by his friend Yale (Michael Murphy) who decides to go back to his wife. This leads to the awkward but funny situation of the two couples double-dating. Then Yale and Mary get back together again. Woody Allen has left us with a movie that has as much heart as humor. At the end of the movie, he feels he has found a grain of truth and moves on.",

            "content": "I'm always a bit conflicted watching a Woody Allen movie. The guy can be brilliant, but always in the back of my mind is the way he betrayed a long time relationship with Mia Farrow by taking up with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn. There was also the scandal revolving around adopted son Dylan Farrow, all of which makes me sour on Allen as a human being. It appears that in his early directed films, he might have offered some prophetic insight toward his behavior. For example, in \"Bananas\" there's a scene at a magazine stand where he's looking at a girlie mag, and he says to a bystander that he's doing a study on perversion and child molesting. Or take \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" where Allen's character blows off child molesting by saying that 'half the country is doing it'. So here, in \"Manhattan\", he's actually cavorting with a seventeen year old girlfriend portrayed by Mariel Hemingway, who oddly, turns out to be the most mature person out of all of Isaac's (Allen) acquaintances by the time the movie is over.Cinematically, I liked the film for it's crisp black and white portrayal of New York City, especially the night time scenes of distant cityscapes and beautifully lit street venues. As is often found in Allen's scripts, the characters deliver many of the nuances of love and life's miseries along with it's unintended consequences. Appearing as Isaac's ex-wife Jill, Meryl Streep probably never looked better on screen. But oh, those outfits and hair-do on Diane Keaton, those were the dictionary definition of dated if I had to come up with one. Not that any of the other players didn't evince the Seventies in their appearance, but Keaton's Mary certainly stood out.As for Woody Allen himself, he delivers the ultimate nebbish persona here that he made classically famous in his movies, stand-up routine and television guest spots. He really does come across as a funny guy, and charming enough in his own way, but it's tough to disassociate from one's own personal history. Try as I might, that dichotomy will always exist for me watching a Woody Allen picture.",

It makes me feel like a genius when he mentions Kierkegaard or Kafka and I can say \"I get that!\" None of my friends ever want to talk about existential despair, so when I pop one of ol' Wordy's movies in, it feels like spending time with the friend I always wanted.. the friend I always deserved.. not like the stupid ones I actually ended up with.Plus, it was filmed in black and white, so you know right away that it's good!",

Woody has twice been divorced and has one son from his marriage to Meryl Streep. Streep has written a book about their marriage and Woody tries to explore the lesbian world as she has left him for another woman.Mariel Hemingway, who received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress in the film, is churlish and so immature by the nature of her speaking inflections, that she is a real standout here. Even when she turns the tables on Woody at the end, turning 18 has done nothing for this emotionally challenged young lady.Of course, Woody had to put in his controversial line that by quitting his job, he can't afford to pay for his father's expensive seat in the synagogue for the High Holidays and that the latter will have to sit in the rear. This was totally out of line.Diane Keaton does a very good job here because once again she plays that intellectual snob, full of herself, and in reality devoid of being able to maintain any meaningful relationship. I just loved when she said that she was married to her teacher and that \"imagine, they went to bed and he gave her an F.\" This is good writing by Marshall Brickman.Woody's characters all follow the line of intellectual beings trying to find a place in the world, but they're so neurotic, it becomes impossible for them to achieve this. That's what's basically wrong with the film. Neurotic desires are still unfulfilled at film's end.",

I mulled it over for a week or two, didn't rush it, let it's sensibilities soak in slowly, and then went back for a second viewing. It knocked me out. I thought it might be a perfect movie, which is not to say the greatest movie ever made (if there can be such a thing) but a perfect movie given the relationships between the elements that make up a film, in this case, the Gershwin score, the slightly overexposed b&w photography, the multi-layered script, the actors organised in a true ensemble, the direction and editing with Allen at his most confident. This is no mean feat. I cannot think of a single casting change I'd make, there is nary a false note in the entire piece. Allen, Keaton, Streep, Murphy, all brought their 'A' game but Hemingway is transcendent. She is an absolute revelation and the relationship with the Allen character rings true in every scene. New York never looked better, Gershwin never sounded better, Gordon Willis never exposed film better. This is what can happen when a singular talent holds all the cards and knows how to play them. Over the years, I've only lowered my opinion of this film very slightly. For me this ranks with City Lights.Woody/Issac musing about life, \"Why is life worth living? It's a very good question. Um... Well, There are certain things I guess that make it worthwhile. uh... Like what... okay... um... For me, uh... ooh...

I must admit that I did not know much about Allen's earlier production and it was \"Whatever works\" to instill a desire in me to rediscover some classics I had seen when I was probably too young to understand them, and I can now say that I was positively surprised by the subtlety and modernity of Allen's view. \"Annie Hall\" was more funny, the neurotic character of Alvy Singer was sometimes annoying, but also amusing and tenderly looking for love. Here we find Isaac, a middle-aged man, looking for something, for anything, but incapable of filling the void of his complicated world. He acts on the stage of a city, which has become the symbol of a whole \"degenerated generation\", having lost all moral sense, the metaphor of a lost world, made of intellectually brilliant, but extremely superficial men and women, shifting from one bed to another without distinguishing between sex and love, simply because not interested in the distinction and where intellectualism cannot save them when facing the \"real thing\" of life.I think if we see the movie as a tribute to the out of time glamour of New York, we can consider it an incomparable milestone in the history of cinematography, if we get into moral and human reflection, we get a very sad and depressing view of human alienation. In the end we either pity or blame this lost man, but the overall atmosphere is rather melancholic and humanly depressing, and even Isaac's sometimes annoying talkativeness and mannerism can be forgiven. For me, pity prevailed over blame. As I have already said when reviewing \"Annie Hall\", as compared to the recent \"Whatever works\", Allen's latest movie reveals a more compliant willingness to accept the good of life, which in the end disregards too many complications of his younger years. In \"Manhattan\" we go back to thirty years ago, and, obviously, no sort of this serene acceptance is to be found, here the search for life is still in hard progress, and no well-wrapped happy ending is in sight.",

The storyline may suit perfectly as a prophesy for Allen his own private life decades later, to which I am trying my best shun away since the independence of the film should be irrelevant of the creator's personal idiosyncrasy, which is a hard call in this case. It's a petit bourgeois melodrama, could be a sequel of ANNE HALL (1977, 9/10), there is still Allen and Keaton, and Allen is still a neurotic and nagging cipher, but Keaton here is not a winning scatterbrain, instead being characterized as a high-strung lost cause, which in a sense, these two are very much alike, pretending sophisticate as a charade to conceal their immature rationality. Words are Allen's strongest weapon, so albeit being a bit piqued by the characters (pretentiousness, stupidity and high-brow condescending), the script itself has its shrewdness and comedic tones will suffice to launch an ambiguous attachment towards our commonplace life. The \"humungous\" ex-husband Jeremiah (a cameo by Wallace Shawn) is a caustically satirical prank to highlight the core of self-deception and all the hogwash people brag everyday. This film should also be conceived as a tribute to silent masterpieces (Chaplin's work maybe), the George Gershwin strains are a true rhapsody for fanboys. Visually there are great silhouettes when Allen and Keaton are together, most noteworthy is when they are conversing against the artificial starry night in the museum (which along with the ex-wife's lesbian family, I may detect some references which would later appear in the magnate soap opera FRIENDS). I am a bit bemused to find out Mariel Hemingway has procured an Oscar nomination because she barely has any juicy presentation apart from one heart-breaking segment, but if one must pick someone to grant the appreciation, Hemingway is the best choice since she is the only lovable character in the film. Allen and Keaton can not surpass ANNE HALL which is only two years earlier (although no one looks better than Keaton in the trouser-and-stiletto combo). Michael Murphy, if not the weakest linkage in the midst, is a quite lame professor, unabashedly self-centred scumbag. Streep, only has three major scenes as the dashing lesbian ex-wife, which are all setting against a perpetually occupied motion.",

            "review_title": "Tracy's Face",
            "content": "Midnight In Paris takes its opening from Manhattan, and both are loving odes to great cities, but here additionally we have the smooth jazz saxophone of Gershin, and the voice-over of a certain neurotic trying to find the perfect opening lines to his book. There are some truths and some lies. The biggest truth is Isaac's love for the city, something that even passing time cannot erode - he intends to immortalise it in Willis' stunning black and white photography that captures a distant past, a nostalgic version of the skyscrapers, the ferries, the butcheries, the snowy parks, and of course the iconic shot of the Queensboro Bridge twinkling and silhouetting what seems to be a lovestruck pair. And then he is exaggerating in some instances; he maintains that he and will still have the coiled sexual power of a jungle cat even in his 70s, and remarks if there is anyone that he models himself after it is god. However when it comes time to break up with the 17 year-old Tracy, he subtly deflects the doe-eyed interrogation of love into an act for her own good - now he is 42, miserable, and his hair is falling out. He is self-righteous, but not on the same level of pretentiousness as Yale or Mary, who pride themselves in their 'Academy of Overrated' and disparage great artists from all areas. Watch how they and Isaac spar - well not spar, they laugh and snicker, while Isaac adamantly refuses their every suggestion. But one line from his ex-wife's memoir of their disastrous marriage seems to suggest he is not so different (and the group laugh out loud at this reading, but as ElMaruecan82 points out, Tracy would never have done so, and I agree); as much as he seems to despise these pseudo-intellectual New Yorkers, he chases eagerly after one and only succeeds in doing so on account of being one himself. He is disillusioned with his successful comedy show, so he quits without really thinking just how much of a downgrade he will have to suffer in his lifestyle - what is more important, his integrity, or the colour of his tap water? He complains at length about it, and in the next scene the cameras tracks him as he walks over to hand a crystal clear glass of water to Mary, but we already knew that it was her. He adjusts his personality depending on who he is trying to woo. He is also hypocritical. Watch how two grown men argue and bicker over a grown women like she is a toy. Yale spits out that he saw her first. Isaac is clearly bitter about being cheated on despite doing the same to Tracy. Yale childishly retaliates later and lies to his wife, solely pushing the blame on his dear friend. Earlier, they unexpectedly bump into Mary's ex-husband, and Isaac is pushed swiftly out of the frame, but it matters not, because Wallace Shawn as Jeremiah is his spitting image, middle-aged, balding, short (it's even suggested he used to be overweight). Isaac marvels that a man that looks like that could ever be a dominating, devastating sexual partner - but of course, he's assigned these roles to himself.Mariel Hemingway is Tracy, the 17 year old girlfriend, and hers is perhaps the best performance of them of all, quiet, assured, straight faced. It is a testament to her ability that I find myself with troubling thoughts, never once wondering about her attraction to the older Isaac, but questioning over and over how he managed to get her. This is the mindset of Isaac, who manages to convince himself and her that she is youthful beyond her pretty face, that she is inexperienced and precocious, that she has many lovers ahead, and that she does not yet know what love is. In short, that she is uncorrupted. Watch his little sly smile as Tracy answers \"I go to high school\", clearly out of her element, and he loves this about her. He is babying her, but indulging in it at the same time. Willis frames the two close yet far apart in the stylish apartment, distant, as he once again lectures her on how to approach this relationship that seems a dying cause. She makes a joke about how little he thinks of her knowledge of the arts, and we cut away before he can respond, but we know it is a dismissive one. They take a horse drawn carriage through the glittering nightime skyline, and Isaac dubs the experience corny, saying he's done it all before as a kid, but deep down he treasures this little memory, and thinks himself lucky to be able to do it again with such a beautiful girl. He finally comes to his senses in the final scene. Once again we start with a voice-over, which quickly turns into something more immediate and genuine - he is not attempting to wittily open his biography, but quietly recording himself musing over life's wonders. Music (most of all Gershin, who serenades throughout), cinema, good food, and then he fixates on Tracy's face. He runs her down, perhaps one of the first instances of this romantic comedy type confession. But here, although it is sincere (the most he has been the entire movie), it is also selfish, and he is sabotaging all his previous arguments and insistence on her naivety and youthfulness and boundless opportunities, but if he can have her again, it does not matter. He pleads for her to not get corrupted, while she insists it is just a few months. Who is the kid here?",

Keaton is luminous, funny, and touching.  Her 'I'm from Philadelphia' routine is so funny.  The scene at the planetarium and the shot of Allen and Keaton sitting on the park bench with the Brooklyn Bridge in the background at dawn are breathtaking.

            "content": "I've never seen so many mixed user comments for any movie like I see for \"Manhattan\".  When I first saw it back in 1986, Woody Allen was at his \"height\" again after \"Hannah and Her Sisters\".  So I watched it with a sense of awe then.  Now, 17 years later, I sat through \"Manhattan\" again and I have to say that I generally agree with the people here that say it's overrated.  After so many years of seeing Woody Allen's films, there is a repetitiveness in so many of his themes: death, meaning of life (or lack of..) and infidelity.  Jesus, he even managed to get those themes into \"Radio Days\".  Even his dialogue sounds the same from movie to movie and it really bothers me now.  The film is beautiful to look at sometimes but that is because he used Gordon Willis as his Director of Photography.  That man could make anything look great and here he does.  He even shoots scenes of garbage piled up on the streets and it looks OK.  The main problem with \"Manhattan\" and similar movies like \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" is that when all is said and done, why should we really care about any of these people? I'm not expecting Allen to do a movie about welfare mothers or drug addicts in New York but these people are priviledged, spoiled white people who whine about death and how their relationships go no where.  After all these years, his movies have become pointless and stifling.  I still like \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" and \"Bananas\", \"Sleeper\" and \"Annie Hall\".  But the guy thinks WAY too much of himself and his \"ideas\".  The word now for Mr. Allen is insufferable.  It's too bad.  There was a time when he was truly dynamic. Now he's irrelevant.  Skip this movie unless you're a big Woody Allen fan and \"need\" to see all his work.",

            "content": "Woody Allen is easily one of the most brilliant satire-directors of cinema, and 1979's 'Manhattan' is one of his grandest achievements. Woody Allen stars as Isaac Davis, a TV-writer who's uncomfortable with his job and his 17-year old girlfriend Tracy - so instead he starts off writing a novel and becomes besotted with Mary, a neurotic intellectual who's having an affair with Isaac's best friend, Yale. Woody Allen more or less plays himself in another round of wit and self-deprecation, Diane Keaton who feels misplaced and uncomfortable about dating a married man, Mariel Hemingway as the beautiful and innocent drama student and off course the young Meryl Streep, Isaac's ex-wife who left him for another woman.The psychoanalysis of 'Manhattan' is pure Woody Allen, and he keeps his wit and charm in top-form. But most memorable of all is its starry depiction of Manhattan, photographed in gorgeous black-and-white by Gordon Willis - the opening montage is like a Valentin-letter to the city of his soul, city-pictures with Allen's narrative-voice is possibly Allen's greatest opening scene ever. The production design speaks just as loudly as the characters does, and wherein they speak it's dry wit, neo-intellectuality or emotions a-flow - and therefore it's particularly memorable towards the ending, as Isaac lays on his couch recording his thoughts on the citizens of Manhattan's many neurosis, on the way that keeps them away from confronting bigger and more unsolvable problems - he cheers himself (and the audience) up by listing things that does life worth living; whether it's Groucho Marx, sports, films or literature.'Manhattan' is Manhattan with romanticism and wit; the beautiful, moody takes of Allen and Keaton benched below 52nd Street Bridge is one of cinema's most memorable and the blending use of George Gershwin-music really puts it all at ease, and in one notable scene we cut right from Allen and Hemingway's sweet park-date with loud music to the reality of Mary and Yale fighting over their secret relationship.Woody Allen gives us a tour of his Manhattan, the gorgeous and magical aspects of it, but also the bitterness and neurotic nature of himself and itself. And the way Allen contributed his natural humor into the urban-romance-drama is magnificent, and it's really one of the most notable romance-comedies of all time, and is truly a standout.",

I liked the interpretation of Woody Allen who played as Isaac and I have to say that he was really good at it. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned is the beautiful Diane Keaton's who played as Mary and she was equally good.Lastly I believe that \"Manhattan\" is not the best movie of Woody Allen but is still interesting to watch and if you have a spare time this is a nice choice.

The film has no depth; the characters are pointless non-serious no-bodies; the pseudo-intellectualising has no moral / psychological direction and no foundation in knowledge (Keats's phrase \u0091negative capability' is misused twice without any allusion to the poet).  The only serious person is the seventeen year old girl who is dismissed as a stupid kid with a Mickey mouse voice: when presented with the profound talent and a wise fidelity of Mariel Hemingway's character this is all the film can come up with.  The reason why the film and Woody Allen have been so successful is because they never compete against anything above their own very low level.  The film is full of people each of them more pathetic or superficial than the next, so that it is hard to realise that they are all such a waste of time \u0096 each of them justifying the other's lack of values.  The same can be said of Woody Allen: there is no one else in the history of cinema who has had so little ability, but so high an opinion of himself; he stands alone because he is the only person with such an extraordinarily mediocre vision to dare to reach so high; to project his nothingness no relentlessly. The film is only great as far as Mariel Hemingway is great: she is great and she has the last word ergo the film is great.  She carries the whole film through and tops it off, despite Allen's inability to work himself up to any profound emotional state for the finale (even with the strenuous running).",

As for the movie itself, it just seemed like your typical Woody Allen movie, which are usually about relationships between friends and lovers. For 1979, this must have been a unique movie because of its mixture between comedy and serious relationship issues, which we all can relate to, but for this day and age, we have seen this type of film many times before. The relationship between Woody and the young girl was interesting, along with the ex-wife, played by Meryl Streep, whose become a lesbian after having a child with Woody, so there's enough material to keep the movie watchable. Personally, it does go down as some of his best work because he got everything right, but I'm still struggling to get his humour. Watchable!Round-Up: After watching some of Woody Allen's later work, I can see why everyone rated his earlier on projects because he had a unique style of directing/writing which is very dry and offensive but in a joking type of way. Half of his jokes in his earlier movies, wouldn't be politically correct for modern times, which is why it's easier to stick with Romantic Comedies. Anyway, Mariel Hemingway put it a emotional and realistic performance, at such a young age, and the rest of the cast made the movie believable interesting.Budget: $9million Worldwide Gross: $40millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there Woody Allen movies about finding love and relationships with close friends. 6/10",

            "content": "There's really nothing profound in \"Manhattan,\" Woody Allen's first success after 1977's \"Annie Hall.\" It's a story about trying to find what relationships work best that is merely themed in New York City. You get a sense that this movie was Allen really trying to do a film that he wanted to do while using some of the same tactics from \"Annie Hall.\" But while Allen tries to give the film a classic feel by showing shots of the city and the skyline, filming in black and white and using Gershwin music throughout, it's really a movie more about people and their often strange relationships.Allen plays another moderately successful Jewish writer named Isaac Davis trying to live in New York City who has been married twice, has a child and in comic Allen fashion his last wife (interestingly enough played by Meryl Streep) left him and became a lesbian. Now of course, at the age of 42, he's dating a 17-year-old (Mariel Hemingway). If that weren't enough his best friend Yale (Murphy) is having an affair with a woman (Keaton) who Isaac can't help but also be interested in.The film is about these characters and how they handle each other and their views of themselves. Both Allen and Keaton's characters are much different from \"Annie Hall,\" mostly because they aren't as likable because they're egotistical. Allen believes he's a sex maniac and Keaton believes she's a highly intellectual, beautiful young woman when she's really just pretentious. The acting is great and the characters are definitely interesting, but certainly not lovable. If you really take the time to analyze the characters there is a lot of depth to the film. Allen is sure to use a wide array of troubled relationships, especially by contrasting Isaac with Tracy (the high schooler). At the same time, however, there really isn't much of a dramatic climax and you spend too much time picking the characters apart because of their glaring flaws to really care about what's happening to them.Perhaps Allen's biggest fault here is not really working in New York City like the film title and the film's opening suggest. You want to feel like the city should be its own character but it never quite gets there. There is some suggestion about the city as a place of comfort, and Allen chooses many interesting shot angles that include the background more than usual, but you don't feel that being in New York adds a significant layer to the film.Overall, \"Manhattan\" is a terrific film about relationships and having difficulty in them. There is a lot of painful truth in the way these characters view and deal with their lives and view and deal with each other. If only Allen took more time to get the film to really hit on some of those moments and make them echo stronger, \"Manhattan\" would have been more than just a classic to the Allen-loving crowd.",

So after hearing so many good things about this movie, I decided to rent the DVD.I know I'm in the minority here, but I was letdown by the film. There were parts that were brilliant, but I found most of the characters to be very weak. I didn't care about them at almost any point in the film.It started with Allen's Issac. I found the relationship with Hemingway's Tracy to be appalling. Basically, we're supposed to root for a guy who is committing statutory rape throughout the film. I'm no prude, but I just couldn't stand the sight of them togther -- it was repulsive to me. Allen's dilemma over the relationship worked for a while, but his ultimate decision over Tracy bothered me.Second, Issac doesn't really seem to grow in the film. He starts out as self-centered and self-righteous and doesn't really change at all. It's only through his self-centeredness (listing the things that make HIS life worth living) that he realizes he wants Tracy.Yale was a decent character -- his constant rationalizations were a sharp commentary on modern morals. But his wife was completely two-dimensional. It seemed as if Allen didn't know what to do with her.Likewise, Meryl Streep as Issac's former wife was also underdeveloped. Streep looked tired and delivered her lines with no conviction.On the other hand, I liked Diane Keaton's neurotic character. She started off as this obnoxious pseudo-intellectual, but Keaton did a great job showing her vulnerable side and her inability to make herself happy. She was the one person who seemed real to me in the film.There is some brilliant dialog (Issac and Yale's argument at the end, Issac's criticism of borgeouis intellectuallism) and I loved the camera work. I used to live in NYC, and seeing this film made me want to go back. But when a movie so character-driven has characters so creatively bankrupt, it's hard to enjoy it.",

Each and every review praises the romance brought to screen. There must be something wrong with me because I didn't find this movie romantic at all. It seemed like a string of narcissistic flings more than any true romances. Not one character was the least bit appealing, except maybe for Tracy, if only for her sincerity. I thought Issac was a complete louse, and not because of the age difference; he just seemed selfish, flippant, and needy. He did have some good lines though, especially mocking the pseudo-intellectual art crowd, and the scene with the skeleton was pretty great. I thought Keaton was annoying, and Streep was pacing around way too much. Was she attached to a motor or something? Look, it's not that I need to have lovable characters. Scorsese has horrible characters but they serve the story, when the point is corruption, violence, what have you. But if the point is romance, then the characters should at least be tolerable. Not these neurotic rich white new yorkers! Maybe other ones in other Allen vehicles. The music was about a thousand decibels louder than the rest of the sound in the film, so that I was forced to keep adjusting the volume with the remote, even though I don't like altering the experience of a work. The photography is wonderful. Too bad the content underneath it is so banal. And I like banality! My favorite director is Robert Altman, for goodness sake. It didn't make sense to me that the film making was so artistic, yet what I was watching was so bland. It's like if Orson Wells shot Monster-in-law. Well, that might be an exaggeration. Anyhow, the style just didn't seem appropriate. Maybe it would have if I had felt the amazing romance. Or if I had seen this when I was going through my wistful New York phase. Alas, Manhattan is certainly not what it once was, too bad. Basically, I felt like this should have been my kind of movie but just wasn't at all, and there aren't enough negative words about it on the internet. That's why I have written this.

Which fits New York, but not the nice imagery.This movie is apparently about \"the fall of human values\" or something to that effect. Can't say I got too much of that out of it, except that the relationships that pull together at the end are definitely more surprising than you'd think. We expect a different outcome, we're given a different one.This film is also interesting because it features Allen's character dating a high schooler. I'm not quite clear on the Allen timeline and where he is with his whole crazy relationships thing, so I don't know if this was made before or after he got together with his adopted daughter, but either way it's an interesting thing to put into a film considering the character.Allen also has the ability to make me burst out in laughter despite myself, even during times when I'm not sure I find it funny.All in all it has some good technique and is definitely enjoyable to Allen fans. However he's done better and I can't shake off the feeling that it's just too typical for its own good.--PolarisDiB",

            "content": "In the first films of Woody Allen (\"Bananas\" (1971) and \"Sleeper\" (1973)) he is still recognizable as a former stand up comedian. Not much later the somewhat neurotic Freud interpreter with fear of commitment in relationships would evolve as the typical main character in Allan films (often played by himself).A second constant factor in the career of Allan is his love for New York. Only later in his career his films would be situated in other city's such as London (\"Matchpoint, 2005), Barcelona (\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\", 2008) and Paris (\"Midnight in Paris\", 2011).These two element come together in films like \"Annie Hall\" (1977) and \"Manhattan\" (1979), his best films up to the present day. \"Manhattan\" is an ode to the city, and the city of New York certainly is one of the characters, if not the main character.Making films about a city is not a new idea. Examples from earlier days of film history are \"Berlin, die Sinfonie der Grosstadt\" (1927, Walther Ruttmann) and \"Menschen am Sonntag\" (1930, Robert Siodmak & Edgar Ulmer), both about Berlin.The fact is however that a declaration of love to the city of New York was not at all very logical in the seventies. The city was in decay and it took three capable mayors (Ed Koch, Rudolph Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg) to put the city back on track again. A film such as \"Taxi driver\" (1976, Martin Scorsese) gives a totally different picture of the city.Nevertheless, \"Manhattan\" is a declaration of love to the city of New York, and nowhere is this more obvious than in the brilliant opening scene.Beautiful images in black and white.Beautiful music in the form of \"Rhapsody in blue\" by George Gershwin.A chaatic monologue in which Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) is thinking about the opening lines of his novel about New York, but gets stuck al the time.The chaotic opening monologue made me think of the opening monologue in \"The Big Lebowski\" (1998, Joel & Ethan Coen).",

            "content": "Aesthetics - this is the word I would use to describe this film. Aesthetics in everything - in the visual composition, in the behavior of the characters, in witty dialogues, and in the very essence of the film. Even its minimalistic tones introduced with the help of black-and-white photography permeates this film with a romantic flourish. The actors' dialogues are filled with drollery and, at the same time, meaning, reflections on life, interpersonal relations, and self-discovery. That is not a typical comedy like \"Friends\", where comic situations and play on words in addition to behind-the-scenes laughter make the viewer laugh. With Woody Allen's comedy, it's just the opposite. The maximum realism of the story and the behavior of the characters, accurately combined with their rhetoric, create a kind of mirror for the viewer to self-observe and laugh. The humor in 'Manhattan' doesn't seem forced or written in just to make something funnier, the jokes are naturally funny.'Manhattan' narrates us the story of several characters that are going through several affairs: Isaac Davis (played by Woody Allen himself) who is twice-divorced and has an affair with a seventeen years old girl, and his best friend, Yale (Michael Murphy), who is married and has an affair with a girl he met at a party. The relationships aren't really the point of the movie though. It's more about what people say during relationships - how their words affect each other and shift each own perspective. I personally can single out the acting of Mariel Hemingway who plays that seventeen years old girl. Her character is so pure and innocent. Still unaffected by Manhattan values she believes that a person can have a one true love for the rest of his or her life. She has faith in people and represents a hope which other characters seem to have lost.No wonder this very film by Woody Allen has been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. One important thing to note: movies that are selected there are not the best American films of all time, but rather considered as works of enduring importance to American culture. They reflect who Americans are as a people and as a nation. And 'Manhattan' is that movie. Woody Allen was born in New York, spent a lot of his time there, and by viewing this movie, you can certainly tell that he loves it, especially Manhattan. And it is his love of New York that drives the movie. It's his homage to the city, and the way he shows it to us, through cinematography, is the way he sees it, and it truly is fascinating. He doesn't hide from us its imperfections, that it is hectic, self-obsessed, and disturbing in some way. He shows us its real self - and that is valuable.New York is indeed a magical and alluring city. It is a muse for many people of artistic nature. One of them was Scott Fitzgerald, who also drew his inspiration from it. In his essay published in 1932 titled My Lost City, he describes his relationship with New York and his becoming its citizen. Although he was born in Minnesota, his susceptible yet conscious years were spent in New York thus, influencing him greatly and subsequently his creative work. Neither Scott Fitzgerald nor Woody Allen portrait New York as an idealistic city, but whereas for the former - it became dull like its spirit faded away, for the latter - it is still something sacred, something loved. For Fitzgerald, the young generation of that time, in his eyes, is lost. He writes in his essay: 'Young people wore out early - they were hard and languid at twenty-one... none of them contributed anything new.' For Allen - the young generation (in the guise of young Mariel Hemingway) is hopeful, striving for better.'Manhattan' is more than just a film - it is a tribute. It is a sign of love and respect that could not have been expressed by mere words. It is a piece of art created by a man who put in it a part of himself.",

No something a comic genius would do. The public asked Woody for another Annie Hall film and so he gave the world Manhattan. Sit back and think off all the things in common between Annie Hall and Manhattan. You'll find many things that the two films have in common.While Interiors prove Allen is a master of making films on relationships and family, Manhattan proves that Woody can make us laugh by feeding the public used plots and character structure.

Too sexual.Chapter One, New York City, I'm filming a tapestry of your many complexities and nuances, leaving no stone unturned, no filth free of its objective natural decay, no natural beauty free of its subjective essence. No, too psycho-analytical.Chapter One, I mean, what to say, really. New York City, I'm asking you to allow me to use you as a background character. Like anyone who wants to be in my films, whether good or bad, you'll pose stupidly, in black and white, a straight man to my self-indulgent rants. I'll star and chatter endlessly before, during, and after the lines delivered by the two dimensional, ridiculously unrealistic versions of human beings (and their analysts), beings who will become nothing more than foils to my massive ego disguised as a neurotic whine. At some point, I'll unwittingly or poignantly describe the noise I make as a trumpet sawed in half. I'll lecture characters and myself simultaneously as the cliched triangle-headed anti-hero in black frames, repeatedly questioning yet reaffirming the animal magnetism that somehow tractor beams a pretty girl in high school with homework and an allegedly insecure women who speaks her mind from the outset of the film but then crumbles before my domineering presence in bed. I'll have conquered other terrific beauties, one of which is raising my son with a lesbian partner I tried to run over (and writing a book about our relationship, probably mentioning what a dynamo I was in bed... perhaps? Yes?... Hopefully?... BUT I'M COMPLETELY AGAINST IT!). Speaking of triangles, my dry toast married best friend \"Yale\" will become the anti-hero to my anti-hero, as we both swing our way through the city having relations upon relations with these or other women. I'll struggle through the trials of multiple divorces, alimony, a young, over-sexed girl, and an insecure woman who both can and cannot live without me and the aforementioned married friend who is in love with her. I'll show off my virile athleticism, stumbling down a sidewalk as I dribble a basketball during visitation with my son, and later stumbling across a racquetball court during visitation with my best friend. I'll be built up into a god-like creature, before having to deal with the seemingly interminable fallout of too many women wanting to have sex with me at once. What a dilemma! Did I mention we'll talk about it this the whole film through, from scene to scene, and perhaps in between cuts?Towards the end, I'll analyze myself on a couch, seeking answers to some very existential questions, asking what makes life worthwhile, not for a moment giving credence to the thought that audiences might for a second find this self-despair unbelievable. Then I'll pull out the mouth organ my 17 year old high school lover gave me because she thought I might like to play it (right before I broke up with her). I'll run across the city, showing off all of its vibrancy in shades of gray. Gershwin will pipe in and out. The audience will know that my love interest is now legal even though I'm not making love to her at this point. \"Where are her parents and family (does anyone care?)\" they'll ask, while I'm stammering and murmuring my final lines of dialogue. I'll then think \"why didn't I use Meryl Streep more?\" and \"why did I shoot in black and white and an aspect ratio that makes no sense?\" and \"thank God for Annie Hall\" and \"will a relationship with an underaged girl come back to haunt me?\"I'll later want to burn the negatives on this film, offering to make two films in its place.4/10 stars",

Seen at first as a romantic comedy depicting the relationship between a middle-aged man and a teenager, the plot takes on complexities that only passionate people will be able to recognize. Isaac's and Tracy's romance does not thrive because of sheer immaturity ... of him.Although the romantic mood is always present, what you see most during the development of the plot are people who can't stand experiencing happiness and are always looking for justification to break up with their partners: Isaac persuades Tracy to leave it; Mary, who is having an affair with Yale, also asks him to leave her because he has no nerve to leave his wife; Yale himself encourages a relationship between Mary and Isaac to later regret.It seems that romances are a pretext for the director to celebrate his private love for Manhattan, a place he loves. From the opening of the movie, with dawn in Central Park to George Gershwin's Blue Rhapsody, to the iconic scene of the couple Mary-Isaac on a bench on Sutton Square overlooking the Queensboro Bridge, what follows is a sequence of New York rituals of that time: going to the Guggenheim Museum, art films, lake boats, concerts, Chinese food and a string of romantic songs performed mainly by the New York Philharmonic, under the baton of historic conductor Zubin Mehta.At the end of the movie, after meetings and mismatches, it seems that, along with Isaac, we all fell in love with Tracy aka Mariel Hemingway. Her acting is so natural and devoid of glamor that she seems to be the only person balanced within a multitude of beings utterly unable to get along serenely. When everyone introduces themselves, they speak not what they are but what they do, it is Tracy's most entertaining speech. After people say they are from TV, from the publisher, from literary criticism, she says:\nI'm from high school.",

            "content": "\"Chapter One. He adored New York City. He idolized it all out of proportion\". So begins Manhattan, the most shamelessly self-reflexive (if less autobiographical) opus produced by Woody Allen after a slew of much overdue critical hits. To many, it seemed Allen's idea bank had already run dry, re-treading territory he had explored to Oscar winning effect in 1977's Annie Hall and demonstrating little evidence of anything truly new. To those same skeptics, it became clear that although Allen tended to re-tread the same terrain, he also demonstrated an uncanny knack for continually extracting new nuggets of both profound and hilarious observations from that same source material, managing to make yet another film of people struggling to live and love in New York seem as fresh and vivid as ever. Indeed, in a contemporary context, Manhattan proves one of Allen's finest films, showcasing all of his defining elements at their most sharp, enormously charming and of course hysterically funny.One of the greatest misconceptions of Manhattan is that it serves as a mere Annie Hall-lite, its similar crafting of the ups and downs of a chaotic big city relationship (complete with Allen and Diane Keaton as the conflicted lovers to boot) making it only succeed as a secondary companion piece to the former. While debates over the quality of both films are ultimately a matter of individual opinion, it remains indisputable that Manhattan is a film of such vast scope and quality (and ultimately different intent) that to dismiss it as dwarfed by Annie Hall would be truly unforgivable. True to form, Manhattan does indeed proves yet another exploration of Allen's standard players in his beloved New York, but what makes the picture really stand out is how daringly ambiguous his character study is, crackling with as many shrewd meditations on romance, interpersonal dynamics and existential quests for meaning as his acerbic, gaspingly funny one-liners. This is a film piled full of refreshingly fallible people, complete with as many credible flaws as endearing personality quirks, making it more difficult to entirely devote one's sympathies to a singular character, but at the same time vastly increasing the realism factor and making the believability and vivid honest of the characters make them all the more appealing, flaws and all.However, despite the astute characterization being a highlight, it becomes abundantly clear that Allen's barely concealed intent was to craft a celluloid love letter to his favourite city, and as consequence, Manhattan is easily Allen's most visually gorgeous film, the crisp black and white cinematography drinking in every lusciously cinematic inch of the titular city with more tenderness than he captures any of his human characters. In many ways, Allen's Manhattan serves as somewhat of the antithesis of a film noir, revelling in his romanticized fantasy New York rather than exposing it seedy underbelly. The care and devotion Allen invests in his mise-en-scene is truly heart-warming, making the inherent sentimentality under the overcoat of neurotic cynicism inject real heart into the picture, making it all the more irresistible. As an actor as well as writer/director, Woody Allen continues his peak of stardom, by this point having his neurotic yet sporadically confident, wisecracking, sensitive and consistently self-serving persona so down pat he could easily (and likely did) do it in his sleep. Similarly, Diane Keaton essays a ditzy, impulsive and outspoken yet intelligent and vulnerable figure not at all unlike Annie Hall, but infused with such confidence and brimming charm and personality that despite her potentially repulsive intellectual pretension and shallowness, the viewer can't help but fall in love with her all anew all over again. Mariel Hemingway quietly and naturalistically oozes quirky wit and subdued pathos as Allen's consistently marginalized teenaged girlfriend, the emotional heart of the film, and Michael Murphy gives such a down to earth, credible performance that the viewer is never sold on whether to despise his serpentine charm or be drawn in by his earthy charisma. The legendary Meryl Streep also shines in a hilarious early role as Allen's now lesbian ex-wife, stealing scenes like the professional she was fated to become without ever derailing the focus of the picture. With Manhattan, Woody Allen reinforces his reputation as one of the most observative, insightful and hilarious filmmakers of his era, tackling familiar grounds with such a sharp tongue and teary eye that the viewer cannot help but be seduced. Any in search of comedy at its most jubilant, caustic and crucially genuine need look no further Manhattan - they are exceedingly unlikely to be disappointed.-9/10",

Cause it's so funny, so interesting, and very entertaining and in the end I haven't witnessed something so romantic in a Woody Allen film.The acting is all very good. Especially from Woody Allen and Mariel Hemingway. Allen here isn't a good guy, but a likable character. Hemingway, nominated for an Oscar in this movie, is adorable. I wonder what else she was in. She looks horribly familiar. Manhattan is a black and white film about a guy named Isaac(played by Woody Allen). Isaac is dating a seventeen year old(played by Mariel Hemingway)who he doesn't love. He has an ex-wife(played by a younger Meryl Streep)is a lesbian and is writing a book about their marriage. And Isaac has a crush on his best friend's girlfriend(played by Diane Keaton). Who at first he doesn't like and then grows onto her.Allen's character is a bad person. But he plays his usual goofy self so he's likable. You don't get that much from Diane Keaton as you did in Annie Hall. But the film's plot and everything is better than Annie Hall, which I still thought was an excellent film.

            "content": "Having read the reviews of Woody Allen's Manhattan that precede mine, I feel quite inadequate and unable to completely and originally express my total and utter appreciation and admiration of this great film. Most have already seen and understand the beauty of Gordon Willis' black-and-white photography of New York City, the inspired wit and sophistication of Allen and Marshall Brickman's script, and the fine line Allen walks in directing between tragedy and comedy. Yet, how can I share in words how great an experience this film is? A psychiatrist could have a field day trying to dissect and analyze all the subconscious and hidden feelings and motivations that occur between the three main adult characters, but what it really breaks down to is that Isaac, Yale and Mary represent a part of nearly every human being that has or will attempt to start and maintain some sort of healthy and meaningful relationship. None of them seem to have the ability to share their feelings without any hindrance or caution at all; they all hide behind their own insecurities and excuses. In most romantic comedies today, these insecurities would be the central aspect of the characters; we would notice their acting out rather than their true agenda. Here, Allen is comfortable enough with the material to let the actors shine through and deeply express what each person really wants, or thinks they want.That being said, the acting here might be the best of any Woody Allen movie. Allen is great by toning down his usual stand-up persona and allowing the character of Isaac to really seep in and show himself as more than just neurotic and slightly narcissistic. Michael Murphy as Yale is also very good, somehow able to command our sympathy for someone who just might be the most unlikable person in all of Manhattan. But, Diane Keaton as the intellect Mary with enough personal issues to make Freud buy a new couch really steals the show and is in my mind, Keaton's best performance in a long and wonderful career. Her monologues when she discusses art and culture indicate someone who has learned all that is unnecessary to really live life. Indeed, Isaac even alludes to this, saying she truly knows nothing of what it means to feel like a person.There is also something extraordinary in the music Allen uses, particularly Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue. The film bookends with magnificent wide-angle shots of the overview of Manhattan and the music adds to the cinematography to create a feeling of wonder and awe; how can a city this terrific and life-changing be available to all of us to visit? This is really a love letter to NYC and having not been there before, I cannot express now how much I want to go if only to visit the museums and theaters and parks these people have available at their will.I cannot end this review without pointing to Mariel Hemingway's Oscar-nominated performance as Tracy, the 17-year old high-schooler who is the most honest and forthright of all the characters in her feelings and expressions. Perhaps Allen feels innocence and naivet\u00e9 are the best form of allowing yourself to be honest. Her performance balances out the zaniness of the three leads and the final scene between her and Allen really strikes a note rarely seen in movies, much less romantic comedies. Roger Ebert said this is a film not about love in the present but love in the past; realizing you've lost a good thing and cannot recover. This is Allen's deepest regret and it is a testimony to help us understand that in every relationship we attempt, this outcome always lingers as a possibility.",

            "content": "What is the movie about? The title, MANHATTAN, tells the viewer what the movie is about. Gershwin's \"Rhapsody in Blue\" from its 1924 inception underscores a day in the big city, preferably--Manhattan. Note how often the camera is stationary as characters move into and out of camera range, but the camera doesn't move; clearly, characters--in search of what--are interlopers of the topic that is Manhattan. The Black & White cinematography creates a stripped down city without the clutter of color disrupting and disturbing; again reinforcing the notion that Manhattan is what the movie is about.I was never troubled by Woody Allen's interest in younger women; the theme is as old as humanity--David & Bathsheba comes to mind. When most 40+ year old women start sagging in all the wrong places and looking frumpy, older men get better looking. And don't kid yourself, the membrum virile still works with enthusiasm, even if not that of a 15 year old. So what older man doesn't pine for a younger woman. The downside-- a bodacious bod with an insipid mind. But that is another story. Though, if Mariel Hemingway continues to smoke, she too will soon enough start to look older than she is.Woody Allen was showing Manhattan with people interloping, spouting their nonsense about one thing or another, as in so many Woody Allan films. Another later New York Comic would create \"a show about nothing\" centered in Manhattan, a couple of years later; Woody Allan beat him to it.The Goofs section tells of \"intellectual\" Diane Keaton (as Marry Wilkie) mispronounces Diane Arbus as Diane and not as she herself pronounced her own name--Dee Anne. Well, who doesn't hear someone mispronounce a name (Van Gogh) and never say anything to correct the person; correcting being a sign of rudeness. Did Diane Keaton know how to pronounce Diane Arbus's name; did Woody Allan; do most people? It is the sort of detail that creates character and a moment in character, of character.Focus on \"Manhattan\" as the topic of the movie and let the characters be as interlopers, then let the characters fall into their proper place as irrelevancies against the backdrop of Manhattan.",

The story is about Isaac Davis (Woody Allen), a twice-divorced 42-year-old comedy writer dating a 17-year-old high school girl (Mariel Hemingway). Isaac eventually falls in love with his best friend's mistress (Diane Keaton).The film is as close to a summation of Woody Allen's views and oeuvre as anybody needs; some smart jabs about the lives we lead are sometimes bogged down in earnestness and half-comic despair, while the protagonist's wildly unsuitable affair with a teenage girl is both funny and sorrowful. Allen takes Parks's lustrous black-and-white images of the city, combines them with Gershwin on the soundtrack and the result is irresistible. As funny as its immediate predecessor Annie Hall, but more sombre too. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed Manhattan \"culturally significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.",

            "content": "Manhattan is a movie that is hard to classify. It wants to be a romantic comedy, but there is not really any romance so to speak of. The movie is too cerebral to be romantic. There is not enough passion in the film and certainly not between the main protagonists. The whole plot is built around the love-triangle between Isaac, Mary and Yale, but there is never any tension or stakes. The romance in this movie is rather flat. There are some sweet moments indeed but it glaringly lacks passion. This is not a love story for the ages, it is merely the story of how Diane Keaton's character decides to give in and fool around a bit with Woody Allen. How Isaac went back to his previous girlfriend because he was out of options.\nThe movie works almost as a drama in that regard.Another issue is that there is humour in the movie but there are no real jokes. It is not a funny movie. You might find humour, ironic situations, but most of the comedy is character based.\nWhich brings me to the biggest culprit: Woody Allen himself. The Isaac characters is so close to his persona, which in turn mirrors his own life, that the whole movie's premise feels strange. When you are watching this movie, you are not really looking at the story of this writer caught up in a romantic intrigue; you are watching Woody Allen putting himself in these situations in order to look good. The whole subplot involving the underage girl is painful to watch, even if you are unaware of Allen's personal life.\nThe movie can be described as Allen putting himself in this series of uncomfortable and unsolvable situation. His character is frequently, if not always, the hapless victim in these situations. And worst of all, I can not really understand why. What is the reason to include the crazy pyscho ex-wife Meryl Streep? What was the point when Yale's wife telling him that she blames him for her husband's affair?\nThe movie wants us to feel pity for him, but he is not a lovable goof, he rather despicable. Just as Mary is by the way, but you don't hate Mary because the movie does not feel like a self-justification exercise.\nIn other words, the movie would have been better without Woody Allen in it.As a director, he is much more competent. It is a rather good-looking movie, there are great shots and every sequence, which is usually two characters talking to one another, is always dynamic and interesting. There is filmmaking craft here. The settings are all \"exotic\" yet it feels effortless and it gives the movie a very relaxed feeling and pace. It does give the feeling of a more intimate and simple story.\nAt the end of the day, you have a romantic comedy without jokes, where the romance is peripheral. It focuses on a character that is too similar to its real counterpart for comfort.",

The man who always writes himself as a neurotic Jewish-New Yorker with two ex-wives here spends the whole film coming to terms with his guilt over dating a younger girl.Manhattan seems to mark a maturation in style for Allen. I say \"seems\" as I must confess I'm no expert, having only watched eight of the thirty-one movies that see him as writer-star. Maybe the more adult narrative comes from Marshall Brickman as co-writer, but this one is more cohesive than the sketchy, fourth-wall breaking antics of \"Annie Hall\". A complete story from beginning to end, this one fills out it's 100 minute duration with no recourse for Allen to debate Fellini to the camera. This film also contains scenes (well, two) that don't feature Allen, though in fairness these scenes do mention Freud and generally revolve around Woody's character (here called \"Issac Davis\", not that character really matters with Woody).Davis is a comedy writer for tv and would-be novelist, whereas in Annie Hall he was a full-blown standup comedian. The marked difference between the two styles is that in the earlier film Woody's \"character\" is abrasive (or \"displaying hostility as a counterpoint of sexual inadequacy\", etc.) here it is softer, more reflective, less egocentric. Unfortunately this also makes him a lot less funny, and while the odd wry smile can be wrung out of this one I laughed out loud with Annie Hall.Allen's direction is also less frenetic, more suited to film here, though his imagery of New York as \"black and white town that plays Gershwin\" is (intentionally) second hand. Even the car journeys are breathlessly slow, whereas in \"Hall\" we see all numbers of crashes and breakneck rides. I can feel comparisons with \"Annie Hall\" flooding through on this one, and maybe it was a mistake for me to watch them back-to-back. Although I can see an advancement in Allen's writing-directing for this movie, I did prefer the previous film, as well as \"Sleeper\" and \"Zelig\" to this one. Finally, Manhattan closes briefly, for, no matter how good Woody's beginnings and middles are, he always seems to have trouble with an effective denouement.",

            "content": "Anyone who has seen lots of Woody Allen movies knows that Allen has worked his way through many genres in his lengthy career. \"Manhattan\" belongs to the schlemiel-in-New York-with-woman-problems genre. The women in this case are Mariel Hemingway as Tracy, a 17-year-old high school girl with whom Woody as Isaac is having a torrid sex affair which she takes more seriously than he, Dianne Keaton as Mary, on the rebound from an affair with a married man who is Isaac's best friend, and Meryl Streep as Jill, Isaac's second wife who left him for a lesbian lover . Don't think of Streep as a leading actress; in this film, she's a gorgeous but secondary figure, and there are no romantic sparks whatsoever between Isaac and Jill. The dynamic is Isaac-Tracy, Isaac-Mary, then back to Isaac-Tracy (too late) when Mary recommits to her married lover and he elects to leave his wife. Isaac literally runs back to Tracy who has taken advice he gave her when they were breaking up to go to study in London. He's changed his mind because he's desperate but she's going any how. And though she expects to return in six months, it's clear that Isaac believes they will never be reunited.Along the way, Woody exposes his familiar neuroses and spills out his jokes here, there and everywhere. \"Manhattan\" is one of the better in this particular genre of Woody Allen's works. Keaton executes her role as a flightly, opinionated, insecure Radcliffe girl with great skill, Hemingway is convincing, and Streep in her brief screen time displays the promise that has made her into one of the great screen actresses of our time. Woody is the Woody we all know in this genre, and that's pretty good.",

Great dialogue from Allen and Brickman and a likable cast help paint the funny, tragic and confused world that our hero lives in.While delivering nothing new and not reaching the heights of Annie Hall (no Oscars this time), it is a bang-on-the-money look at urban life today and its various ups and downs.

His humour is crisp and dry, his films are unpretentious and entertaining, and everything flows like an insightful vignette of life - like art this isn't conscious of being art. Nonetheless, I am a little disappointed with \"Manhattan\".Let's face it: it's just \"Annie Hall\" again with a reworked plot. Aside from the obvious similarities, like Allen playing the main role alongside Keaton, his character is identical. Save the change of name, they both have the same neuroses (which is, indeed, a hallmark of an Allen film), and are both trying to pick up the pieces after a second divorce. Allen's relationship with Keaton is the same in both films: in both they fall in and out of love, and in both she ultimately rejects him.Truthfully, the plot of \"Manhattan\" has more social depth to it: there is more than one relationship being examined, and a fall-out also occurs with a good friend. The ending of \"Manhattan\" is decidedly different to the ending of \"Annie Hall\" as well, but \"Annie Hall\" supports itself with greater strength. Besides, \"Annie Hall\" was a cinematographic experiment of enormous scope; \"Manhattan\"'s claim to artistic fame was the fact that it was not shot in colour. There appears to be little development in Allen's craft in the two short years between releasing one and the other.I think that \"Manhattan/Annie Hall 2\" is a good film, and worth seeing if you happen to be a fan.

            "content": "New York, New York\u0085 the backdrop of wistful big-band jazz ballads, countless movies, photography, landmarks and historical figures born, raised and blossoming on its sidewalks, avenues and skyscrapers. Yet for all of its pomp and circumstance\u2014for all it's King Kongs, Marshmallow Men, John McClanes and Jerry Seinfelds, the realm of the screen whether it's on or off the big one, is one that is notably short on the romantic side of the story. Rarely is it evident that the city itself plays its own character, reflected by the characters, their bond and their adventure into the often daunting, unpredictable and\u2014most of all\u2014unknowing world of love,romance and ensuing comedy.It has largely been up to astute writer and director Woody Allen then to convey New York's softer but all the more vicious side. Through Allen we are treated to glimpses of love through the somewhat romanticized lens of New York City; imperfect, busy, chaotic and downright obnoxious at times, but nevertheless just as charming, larger than life and down-to-earth as you might imagine. Through this common aesthetic in most of Mr. Allen's features therein lies a thin thread of continuity and of consistency that makes his movies his own. Sitting down to watch Manhattan then is something of a reminiscent but nevertheless compelling and surprising experience regardless of whether you have seen the feature or not. Yet for all intents and purposes, Manhattan comes at the end of what is perhaps the director's finest era in cinema and so while it may come across as overly familiar, there are still plenty of little flairs and elaborations of theme that Woody portrays here (and arguably perfects) that in a way redefine both his craft, his ever-persistent love for New York, and his ability to convey that love and bizarre consciousness on screen.Centring around an ensemble of five characters, the story of Manhattan is one that Woody has told countless times over the years, and to mixed effect yet this is never truly the point to his films. Instead, this somewhat convoluted mish-mash of relationship turmoil, confusion and neurosis serves as a catalyst for characterisation of those central characters. Through their complicated love triangles, conflicts of heart and head amongst other things\u2014Manhattan tells a simple story about less than simple characters, their relationships and the city that serves as their roof whilst they have it out with each other.I mean, to simply state that the premise of the entire feature revolves around a 42-year-old male character who is torn between his best friend's mistress of sorts and a 17-year-old intelligent young female who has fallen for his maturity\u2014to say that this serves as the raw building blocks for the tale that Allen spins here will be of no shock to anyone at all knowledgeable on the director, but will nevertheless convey just what is involved here to those unenlightened with his traits. There are film-makers who strive for epic grandiose and shocking derailments of the human psyche and yet here Allen does it without even trying; he's the master of the simple complication; of the everyday niggles that haunt us and distract us from our greater aspirations and Manhattan is probably the perfect culmination of all those elements from previous works.As alluring and captivating as of all this higgilty-piggilty back-and-forth squash interplay between characters against the startlingly beautiful and romantic black and white compositions of New York city spliced over larger than life musical numbers can be however\u2014Manhattan is just as much a bittersweet comedy as it is romance and philosophical tragedy of sorts. Playing his central character as he has so far been accustomed to by the time with part neurosis and part self-assured conviction, Allen not only serves as the film's most identifiably human character, but also serves as a fine source of disconnected entertainment and amusement also. From the razor sharp wit prevalent in most of the characters' dialogue to the rapport that they each share whether it's discussing love, sex, art, life or philosophy; Allen's script is one steeped in intelligence, charm and grace\u2014too often film-makers will shove such elements down throats in an attempt to convey their intellect, and yet once again Woody does it subtly and with a refrain that allows the feature to remain light, highly comical and most of all, romantic.As the years have gone on since Manhattan first graced screens just over three decades ago, the romantic comedy as it is known has become something of a belittled, and confused shadow of its former self. Yet it is a testament not only to the best of films' ability to withstand the test of time but also of the film-maker himself that Manhattan still to this day feels revitalising, prompt and absolutely relevant. Maybe it's the timeless photography by Gordon Willis that renders New York in shades of a wistful dream; or maybe it's the fact that Manhattan is first and foremost a movie about us, who we are and what makes our hearts skip beats when we least expect them to. Whatever it may be, it goes without saying that what Allen achieves here is nevertheless something of a definable milestone for the genre and of cinema itself. It's got heaps of romance that stays true to what it really feels like to be in such perplexing situations, plus a firm sense of personality, razor sharp wit and endlessly engrossing performances that seal the deal right from the get-go; but most of all it's the perfect embodiment of Allen's interest in the simplest of confusing human complications\u2014love. Whether it's for a girl or a city, you just can't ever seem to pin it down, phrase it or convey it just the way you want to.\"No, no, start again.

Since with Annie Hall this film represents the pinnacle of Allen's cinema, your enjoyment of it will depend on your ability to empathize and sympathize with his intense brand of neurosis and self-absorption. I'll attribute my rating to not yet really knowing where I stand in that regard.On the plus side, this is the most refreshing love-story since Harold and Maud - the latter being arguably a better and more sincere film - and while not always likable, Allen's Isaac is a fascinating, endlessly watchable and quotable creature. On a more technical level, there is also, for lovers of film, some sheer delight to be had at just watching Woody handling scenes and sustaining dramatic or comedic tension. The craftsmanship behind the film is undeniable: Allen's trademark mastery of the unbroken shot, together with legendary cinematographer Gordon Willis' unparalleled lighting and sense of composition, make this one of the most beautiful films about New York.If you want to explore vintage Woody, it's probably easier to start with the more playful Annie Hall, but this is then as accomplished as he gets while still placing himself firmly at the center of his work. The more easily irritated viewer might want to ease him or herself into his films by watching the less self-absorbed Match Point or Vicky Christina Barcelona first.",

            "content": "Anyone who has read my other reviews is aware that I am most definitely not a fan of writer/director/actor Woody Allen. I absolutely abhor Broadway Danny Rose, Bullets Over Broadway and Hannah and Her Sisters, films that Allen afficionados place at the peak of his canon of work. That is not to imply, however, that I hold all of his films in such contempt.For instance, I think Manhattan ranks as one of the best films of the 1970s and certainly one of Allen's very best. Ironically, it remains a film that even Allen's fans often forget until reminded of it. More drama than comedy, although it has some amusing moments, the film functions as a lovingly crafted valentine to the joys of New York City, while simultaneously focusing on the messed up love lives of its primary characters.Allen predictably casts himself in the central role of a dissatisfied divorced New Yorker, still reeling from his break-up with former wife Meryl Streep (in a throwaway role). He has stumbled into a relationship with jailbait high school student Mariel Hemingway, but despite her seriousness he refuses to consider it as anything more than a passing infatuation. He instead falls in love with the sophisticated mistress of his best friend (played by Allen regular Diane Keaton), which carries its own set of problems.The storyline is a lot more focused than many of Allen's efforts. His strange desire to film this in black and white would seem the height of pretension, but it actually comes off quite well. I have never been a fan of Allen the actor and often think that some of his films would have worked better had he recused himself from leading man duties - this one is no exception. That said, to deny that Allen does not have his effective moments would be erroneous. For a change, he actually fits into the action rather than seeming inserted into it.Of the supporting cast, Streep is barely in the film long enough to make much impact. Michael Murphy, as Allen's best friend, struggles with an ill-conceived role. The performances to watch are the two main actresses. I am usually not a big fan of Keaton's work, which I think is often mannered and off-putting. Here, she shucks many of her trademark mannerisms and creates a complex lead character. It is one of her best performances. Hemingway - in her best performance - scores in a role that could easily have been embarrassing. Allen has a predilection for casting himself as the romantic interest opposite actresses that are ridiculously too young for him - and given the later scandal that erupted around him - it becomes obvious that it mirrors his own tastes. This film is no exception, with Allen robbing the cradle with a worshipful high school student. The reason why this subplot works is because Hemingway sells it so well. We honestly see no reason for her to be especially entranced by Allen, but when she confides that it is because she finds him funny and charming, we believe that she believes it. The dramatic scene in the mid section of the film where Allen tries to sympathetically dump her to pursue Keaton while cushioning the blow is well done, but it is especially telling of Hemingway's mature performance that we do not honestly wonder for a moment whether she might not end up being the more logical and well-suited love interest - especially with some years to mature.The film is a veritable buffet of beautiful cinematography. It is an incredibly romantic film, but the irony comes from the fact that the romance emerges less from the characters, but from New York City itself. Allen obviously loves New York, but this is one of the few times that he has successfully fine-tuned that \"romance\" and presented it on screen in a way that can be unilaterally shared with his viewers. He imbues the city with the characteristics of a woman and worships it much like Hemingway initially worships him in the film, although in this case the infatuation seems a lot less misplaced.I regard this film as one of Allen's few unqualified successes and find it a shame that Allen fanatics do not have this higher placed in the pantheon of Allen's other (and far more dubious) achievements.",

It's as if he's daring himself to get out, what with Streep having left him for a woman, Keaton leaving him for his best friend, and Hemingway leaving him for London - and all of this is his fault. Yes, there are some funny gags, mostly with the potshots at the NY intelligentsia's pseudo-intellectualism (Keaton bravely holding up her end), but especially good is the riposte to Freudian analysis of 'right' and 'wrong' types of female orgasms, and the building up of the 'brilliant, dominating' man, knocked down by the 'homunculus' comment.But this is not what excites. What does excite is Gordon Willis' brilliant cinematography...witness the Hayden Planetarium scene. And Woody's eye for the angular beauty of Manhattan. Think of this more as a silent movie scored to swelling oceans of Gershwin, interrupted with the occasional noise of flawed humanity, and you'll get far more out of it that way.",

            "content": "Woody Allen is perhaps the most prolific American filmmaker of his generation. He has made more than forty films to date, averaging at an impressive rate of one film a year. Annie Hall (1977) was the motion picture that fully established Allen as one of the most intelligent writer-directors America has ever produced. He followed up with critical darlings such as The Purple Rose Of Cairo (1985), Crimes And Misdemeanors (1989), and Husbands And Wives (1992). Though most of his films lost their resonance in the late 90s, Allen managed to revive his career with the box-office hit, Match Point (2005).Manhattan was made when Allen was at the top of his game. Filmed in black-and-white, it is arguably the most well-loved film in the director's filmography. Manhattan is like a love letter to New York, the city he adores greatly. It stars the man himself as Issac Davis, a 42-year-old Manhattan native with three big, complicated problems in his life: First, he wants to quit his job which he hates. Second, he is frustrated at his ex-wife who turned lesbian and is attempting to write and publish a tell-all book about their marriage. Third, he wants to leave his current 17-year-old girlfriend whom he doesn't love for Mary, his best friend's sexy intellectual mistress.Manhattan explores Issac's unfulfilled love life and his unorthodox methods in handling relationship issues in a city where the quest for true romance seems like an act of futility. The film features an Oscar-nominated screenplay written by Allen and Marshall Brickman. It keenly observes the responsive acuities of the human mind when it comes to tackle complex emotions like love and lust. And it does so with a tremendous dose of astute humor and heartfelt drama.Manhattan is photographed by Gordon Willis who interestingly varies the composite of each scene from murky shots of tranquil New York to pristine shots of the hustle and bustle of downtown New York. A few scenes are completely shot in the dark where the characters' distinctive voices can only be identified; some are shot in near darkness with occasional spots of illuminating light, building an atmosphere that intensifies the romanticism of the moment.Acting feels natural and unexaggerated. The characters take a life on their own and are effective portrayals of smart New Yorkers who strangely entangle themselves in the complicated web of love, marriage, and sex. Woody Allen's Manhattan is an example of a filmmaker working at the height of his powers delivering a motion picture of top-notch quality, perfectly blending humanity, humor, and substance in a film that is regarded to be one of the best and most enduring romantic comedies ever made. A masterpiece! GRADE: A+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",

            "content": "Manhattan is so far my favorite film by director Woody Allen. Shot in the borough of Manhattan, the film features gorgeous black and white photography of the city, perhaps the best lensed Allen film until this point. Furthermore, the film is filled with sparkling dialog and moments of reflection and the touches of humor that Allen did so well in his other great film, Annie Hall.Manhattan again casts Allen as another version of himself, now a scribe for a comedy series and deals with a number of relational scenarios involving his best friend, his best friend's mistress, and a teenager as well as surrounding characters. We watch as these highly dysfunctional and vice-prone characters struggle to understand each other and themselves. Allen never lets things get heavy though, and even though the film is full of subtle comic flourishes, Allen's very competent dialog, combined with some of the moments that he chooses to expose in this story often lift this film into a strange level of effervescence, instead of bitter observation.Although it's hard to love the characters, as they all have such terrible problems, with commitment, with honesty, with integrity... with virtue, at the same time, Allen draws his characters so sympathetically that it's hard not to hope that they find their way. The technical aspects of the film are top notch for the kind of film it is. It's a gorgeous film to watch at times and while the character he plays is not a stretch for Woody, it's familiar and well played. All the main players do their jobs well.I find it very hard to find considerable faults with this film. It's fantastic and possibly one of Allen's best works to date. Depending on your temperament, you might find Annie Hall a better watch, for its sunnier and lighter disposition, it certainly won me over, but of his films that I've seen, Manhattan stands at the top for me. 9/10.",

Not everyone appreciates the man's fast-talking, self-adoring and sometimes deeply complex and psychologically involving films about life, love, passion and New York City. Even I am not the biggest Allen fan, however I cannot help but admire certain things about the man.Manhattan above all, is a glorious tribute to New York City, most notably in the superbly crafted opening sequence that pans across New York accompanied by George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue. Secondly this is about a man named Isaac Davis, a twice-divorced man who is a comedy writer and is dealing with women. His latest girlfriend/accompanying female is a 17 year old school girl played by Mariel Hemingway (excellently) but Diane Keaton catches his attention and he is fascinated by her character. The film is a turbulent alteration of feelings, thoughts and words with some warm and funny scenes, but above all an extraordinary script which is one of the best ever written in my opinion.7/10",

I wanted to start with Sweet and Lowdown (because that's my favorite Gershwin piece and it sounded kind of awesome), which seems to be one of his lesser-known movies, but it wasn't on instant Netflix so I turned to Manhattan. It's set to a strictly Gershwin soundtrack, it's a post-Technicolor black and white film, and it reunites Woody Allen and Diane Keaton- what more could I ask for? As it turns out, a lot. Watching this film was very much, for me, like visiting New York City for the first time. I had heard about New York from Frank Sinatra, seen it in Breakfast at Tiffany's, walked its streets with Holden Caulfield, but when I stepped foot in Manhattan for the first time, I wasn't in Manhattan at all. I was in a dingy city lit up by too many wasted watts of electricity, a city with too many McDonalds and not enough trees. A woman actually blew cigarette smoke in my face and everything! I wasn't in New York City at all, because New York City doesn't really exist, except for in Woody Allen movies and those sorts of things. And so it goes with Manhattan. Here it was, inarguably Allen's magnum opus, his love letter to dear New York City, a guest at the Oscars- but it wasn't. I was hoping for the witty writing, the stand-up comedian sort of humor I had come to expect after watching Annie Hall, but it all seemed very old hat to me, like a watered-down version of Woody Allen movie. I don't mean to sound awful, but I can't help but wonder if he wrote the script just so he could film romantic scenes with someone twenty years younger than himself. And God was it pretentious. It was so pretentious. I'm all for allusions to art or literature or what have you (\"your self-confidence is a notch below Kafka's\"- that line- sorry if it isn't verbatim- did make me laugh), but nobody in real life goes on about van Gogh (gah?) and all the way Keaton's character did.

The Gershwin soundtrack, though, is sublime.And the story is about people who are in love with themselves, which means I am able to build no sympathy whatsoever for their neuroses, trials and tribulations (well, except for Emily and Tracy, who is the bright hopeful light running through the entire thing).It does end on a hopeful note, as the sweet Tracy hopes their love for each other will endure for at least six months and Allen's whistful smile appears to be a philosophical acceptance of \"what will be, will be\" and that they will both be better off, regardless.",

            "content": "There are few filmmakers I find easier to relate to than Woody Allen. I love the way he views the cinema. Even his weak films offer something that sets them apart from other filmmakers. You always get a sense that you are in the presence not of a filmmaker but of a man that is actively revealing his concerns, obsessions, and questioning the world around him. He knows that there are no easy answers to his questions but you see the joy is in questioning. Here is a man whose movies are filled with more cultural references and allusions than your average fair. Here is what he says of Ingmar Bergman, one of his favourite directors: \"Hollywood for the most part aimed at the lowest common denominator. It's conceived in venality, it's motivated by pandering to the public, by making a lot of money. People like Ingmar Bergman thought about life, and they had feelings, and they wanted to dramatize them and engage one in a dialogue.\" This is exactly the same way I feel Allen confronts his films with the major difference being that whilst Bergman is stridently pessimistic and saddening, the latter sees life with humour and sarcasm. If the auteur theory is true, then Woody Allen would be one of its greatest representatives. Manhattan is one of Allen's best, a warm and emotionally resonant tale of love in the city he loves so much.In Manhattan, Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) is a divorced writer of TV shows unhappy with his job. His ex-wife, a lesbian, left him to live with another woman and is writing a book about her relationship with him. He presently dates a seventeen years old high school student, Tracy (Mariel Hemingway), who is in love with him, but who he does not love, at least he thinks. When he meets Mary Wilkie (Diane Keaton), the mistress of his married best friend Yale (Michael Murphy), he has a crush on her. He finishes with Tracy and has an affair with Mary, affecting the lives of many people including his own. The central theme in Manhattan is that people are incapable of valuing what they have in the present always asking for more until, in the future, realising they had all they needed when it's already too late. Isaac for example thinks he does not love Tracy after all, how could a relationship between a 42 year old man and a 17 year old high school student function? Ethically it is unacceptable but what Isaac does not realise until it's too late is that the moral structure of society is a man made invention that blinds us of our true desires: only by following our heart and logic do we become true to ourselves. Characters cover up there troubles with an air of intellectualism and the obvious example is Mary who uses her profound cultural knowledge to protect herself from the solitude and regret she faces when firstly she abandons Yale, and secondly, she falls for Isaac. I could spend ten pages talking about the film's themes but Allen's masterpiece is basically about not being true to yourself, using words that don't always match your actions, inhabiting a world of cynicism, unrealistic ideals and not trusting the intentions of the people around you. It is a funny and truthful study of the elements of human nature we rarely talk about.In the beginning of the review, I said I love Allen's cultural references and allusions. I especially love the moment when they talk about the overrated artists. Keaton's character suggests that artists like Van Gogh, Mozart and Ingmar Bergman are overrated whilst Isaac suggests that every artist she mentioned are truly great. When she downgrades Bergman, Isaac responds by saying \"Bergman is the only genius in cinema today\". I love this line because I think that Bergman is one of the only true geniuses in cinema but the reason I love the film not so much because I agree with quotes like this but because Allen structures a film in which he openly debates cultural issues, especially the cinema. He gives us both sides of the matter and there is no definitive answer but the joy of watching two people with different views talking about it. We may not admit it but it's always stimulating to open a discussion with a person who holds a different view. This is the type of thing Allen captures on camera. Then there is the great dialogue and to watch the characters (especially Woody Allen) in Manhattan use dialogue that is more intelligent, thought provoking, insightful, and funny than anything available today is a complete joy.Certainly the central drama would not be as powerful as it is without the beautiful, somewhat sad and evocative black & white photography by Gordon Willis which romanticizes Manhattan giving it a poetic quality. We can almost smell and touch the city and that is part of the reason the characters become so real. And what beautiful performances especially by Mariel Hemingway who suggests a sweet and innocent quality so appropriate for the role. What a beautiful film this is and how sad it is to know that Woody didn't like it.",

Through Allen's eyes we see their obsessions, petty lies and betrayals.Woody gives himself the best lines but Diane Keaton is excellent as the desperately attractive but desperately annoying Mary. I'll be honest and say that, given subsequent events in his personal life, seeing Woody's character concluding that a 17 year old high school student may be the love of his life made me feel a bit uncomfortable. Maybe I'm just an old fuddy duddy! The film has arguably not dated very well though it has hard to believe that Allen disliked it so much that he begged that it wouldn't be released.

He also creates one of his best characters in Diane Keaton's Mary Wilke.  Like Woody's character Isaac, we are immediately put off by her nervousness and pseudo-intellectual banter. But Mary really is a damaged woman whose \"self esteem is a notch above Kafka's.\"  Keaton's performance is so believable and touching that we fall in love with her just as Isaac does.  Most people rank Annie Hall as Diane Keaton's finest two hours, but I would personally pick Mary Wilke, even over her Oscar-winning turn as Annie Hall. This is the one Woody Allen film that still manages to make me cry.  The tears come from its poignancy (anyone who can keep a dry eye when Isaac breaks up with Mariel Hemingway's Tracy must be a robot), and when Tracy tells Isaac to \"have a little more faith in people,\" that gradual smile that builds on Woody Allen's face gets me every time.

It's a movie on love, life, feelings, honesty, creativity, and mostly importantly, the city that Allen adores, Manhattan.Manhattan is essentially the story of Isaac and his coming to terms with his divorce from his wife, played by Merryl Streep, and at at the same time trying to find someone. He has at this time managed to capture the heart of a young Mariel Hemingway as his love interest even he doesn't intend to keep her. Pretty soon, he finds out that his best friend Yale is having an affair with a young \"cerebral\" Mary Wilke whom Isaac at first abhores, but certain chemistry later follows to create a perfect coupling, including the scene in the museum where he finally admits to himself that he does like her. A lot.It is through these circumstances that we get to know the real characters of this story. We have the newly out lesbian mother, Meryl Streep, the confused and neurotic Isaac, Mary Wilke, who as she claims, is \"trouble, and Yale, who doesn't know what he wants. There is also Yale's wife, who is in denial about the whole affair. These characters create a basic storyline through which Allen and Marshall Brickman were able to explain their insights and ideas on humanity, love, life, intellect and all the things in between.The movie is not perfect, but it is acted incredibly well by the majority of the key players. As usually Allen is perfect, as he should be,he is playing himself, and Diane Keaton, whose portrayal is very honest and funny without becoming to wacky and unbelievable. Michael Murphy wasn't as good as he could have been though, but all in all, the acting was great with few flaws.The majority of the films shots you will notice are usually not close-ups. This is a techniques that Allen used to capitalize on Manhattan's beauty. The movie's few close ups are usually at the end when we have gotten to know the story better.There is an homage to Chaplin, I believe, when we see Allen and his son looking out at a stoe/restaurant gazing at its products. There was Chaplian feeling to it that I believe was intended by Allen.The movie is great and could be Allen's best. There is controversy about that. Some might include Crimes and Misdomeanors and others might stick with Annie Hall as Allen's best. Personally I don't know. Annie Hall and Manhattan were both great movies, I haven't seen Crimes and Misdemeanors, but they were focused on different things and were done differently. While Annie Hall was a more creative feature, with the cartoons and extremely original parodies with Marshal McLuhan, Manhattan was more serious not aiming at humor but more at a serious look at life and the choices we make.It is a great movie and I encourage you to see it.",

It's filled with images of Allen's beloved New York City, submerges itself in the Jewish intellectual culture just enough to allow for a long stream of highbrow jokes and name-dropping, and involves its writer-director-star-auteur in a love triangle with two attractive women, one of whom is 17 years old.On the other hand, Isaac (Woody Allen's thin veneer of a character) is a profoundly unlikeable individual. He's a perpetual worrier and nag and seems stuck in a kind of arrested development that only makes it appropriate to be involved with a high-schooler. His intellectual masturbation and barely-suppressed misogyny (qualities that could be said to leak into the film itself, but are definitely present in the character as a distinct entity) make him an almost repellent figure, although he has a certain level of charm as well.So what to make of this dichotomy, between indulgence and self-loathing? I think this is one of the few cases where auteur theory is borne out: Woody Allen simply vomits himself onto the screen, warts and obsessions and all, and leaves us to decide whether we like him or not. It makes for a movie that's flawed, not approaching the greatness of Annie Hall (but then again, what does?), but still an unique and worthwhile experience nonetheless.",

It just barely misses being Woody Allen's overall finest achievement by only the slimmest of faults, but in terms of purely formal technique, it is a soaring triumph. Gordon Willis' widescreen cinematography is absolutely stunning. The use of black and white effectively unmoors New York from its modern (1979?!) berth, setting it adrift in time to freely conjure deeply nostalgic impressions. Profoundly luscious monochromatic contours, contrasts and textures carry our thoughts back through the city's fabled heritage. The grandeur and majesty of the world's most glamorous urban jungle is meticulously rendered in jaw dropping, sparkling skyline panoramas and sumptuous, bristling, street level vistas - impeccably lit and framed, creating the compelling illusion that only by divine prescience had all of it been brought into existence expressly, exclusively, for these exact cinematic moments. By right of these astonishingly masterful portraits, Woody Allen has claimed full and absolute ownership of his cherished Manhattan.Like a supremely proud deed holder, the camera confidently surveys patinated brownstone doorways and gleaming plate glass facades. That's his spirit and soul we see in the billowing, contorting steam clouds that shroud the evening boulevards and garnish weather beaten rooftops. The quick flashes of eyes and teeth and hands in an infinite array of furtive, frantic, and facile gestures; The softened clink and clunk of one hundred thousand smartly coordinated restaurants, cafes, trattorias, delis, bars, grills, burger joints and soda shops; the intricately synchronized ballet of the herky jerky taxicabs, delivery trucks, buses, cars, scooters, bikes, and people, so very many people; these are the basic units, the irreducible atoms, that compose his private universe. These gorgeous images are Woody's most heartfelt homage to this most unique, remarkable, bewildering place that so thrills him, so nurtures him, so comforts him. This intimidating locale, this impossibly evolved borough, looks so tastefully raw, so elegantly primal. It's wonderfully clear just exactly who is the deserving star of this film.A not-quite-as-clear part is the curious story that's loaded onto this sumptuous stage. It's more than a little creepy to witness the statutory molestation of the divinely cherubic Mariel Hemingway character, Tracy. Yes, as a red blooded, often virile, usually horny, standard issue male, I was viscerally moved by her angelic porcelain beauty, but my \"inappropriate\" desire was sharply chastened by a pious inner voice. That imagined voice was resonant with every overly concerned father, brother, uncle, coach, counselor, friend, foe, cop, judge and jury who's ever deigned to remind some poor sorry slob of just how heinous a moral, ethical, and legal transgression is this sort of liaison. \"She's too damn young!!\" I was being c*%$ blocked by my own vigilant conscience, but Woody - disturbingly - was vigorously proceeding with his assault, even after having repeatedly declared this obvious truth to her and himself.Tracy is a tender 17 years old, and relative to Isaac's (Woody's) 42, she might as well be 10. I'm being hyperbolic, I know, but that's the thing with our morality - it doesn't make any accommodations for art (or reason). It is a very risky gamble, his being so rather casual about something so potentially alienating. In daring to portray so frankly this carnal attraction for the naive and innocent teen Woody is abiding by his personal mandate for authenticity in all aspects of his art. Just as he expects that his cherished town fully expose herself to his unblinking lens, he demands the utmost honesty of himself. He certainly doesn't try to obscure this full frontal view of his own engorged lust. It's almost sinister, how cavalier is his lasciviousness. However, by the anesthetizing splendor of his oh-so-seductive cityscapes we are partly deflected from the deeply repulsive discomfort elicited by his sexual indiscretion. In spite if his lofty aspirations for impeccable integrity, Woody is exploiting the tremendous allure of his mesmerizing visuals to gain approval for his questionable behavior. Just as someone who has squandered an absurd sum of cash in Las Vegas may be granted a modicum of pity - \"It happens to everyone who goes there!\" - so too is Woody petitioning our sympathy for his ignoble sexual conundrum by having it play out in such an irresistibly provocative setting. The expression \"When in Rome...\" comes to mind, and Woody's \"Rome\" is indeed a haven for some very unconventional, odd, illicit, destructive, depraved and neurotic lifestyles. I was almost expecting Woody, at any point, to face the camera and say \"Look folks, I know you don't approve of me shtupping this sweet kid, but c'mon, this is New York...\" It's this slight but critical manipulation that ultimately undermines this masterpiece's claim to supremacy in the Allen canon.If Woody counted on me to identify with an aging, nebbishy, self obsessed, overly critical cradle robber, then he really set a major task for himself. What's so remarkable is just how much of that daunting mission he actually accomplishes, just how very far he's pulled me along on his morally tenuous trek. I first thought that he'd only take me kicking and clawing the whole way, but ultimately I had surrendered my resistance. Finally, by the moment of its semi-tragic finale my better angels had all but exhausted themselves from their relentless preaching, and I was not so pinned down by petty bourgeoisie notions of propriety. In the end, I had reluctantly forgiven Woody for his mortal sin. And yet, still, I can't help thinking that screwing the underage shiksa is sad and gross. I'm from Philadelphia...Woody's story often plays like a public reading of the embarrassingly explicit diary of an eloquent eccentric in which we are all enticed to participate vicariously. That may sound like an invitation to a horribly awkward affair, and \"Manhattan\" sometimes is exactly that, but what finally remains is a glowing sense of awe and admiration for this meticulously lavish valentine to his adored island oasis.",

This Woody Allen movie, finding the perfect balance between quirkiness, hilariousness and romance, is one of his best. Easily having one of the best screenplays ever written, \"Manhattan\" tells the tale of a 42 year old man, Isaac Davis (Woody Allen), searching for true love in New York City, learning gradually what true love actually is. Woody Allen's charm can be felt everywhere in this movie, whether it's learning more about Diane Keaton by the Queensboro Bridge, or taking a carriage ride through Central Park with Mariel Hemingway. Although the words that come out of these people's mouth often result in uproars of laughter, Woody Allen has directed these actors to express emotion through their eyes and body movement instead of their words, which takes a lot of skill. Allen's first black and white film is masterfully lit by Gordon Willis, director of photography on The Godfather films, as well as Annie Hall. By the time we leave the theater, not only are we still chuckling, but we are asking ourselves the same questions that Isaac Davis ponders: What is love? Is there any such thing? Yes, there is. Because if what I feel for this movie isn't love, I don't know what is.",

She has some sort of nasal problem and it would have helped if there were subtitles each time she spoke. She could also use some help in the acting department too.....but that was clearly the director's fault.For those of you who think Allen is a film genius, you'd have to answer why none of his films are taught in film class.",

Even so, he works on TV, until he gets fed up and resigns.Isaac is also an exscinded individual when it comes to his love life. He has a relationship with Tracy (gracefully played by Mariel Hemingway), a 17 years old girl, 27 years younger than him. He seems worried about having his friends mocking him for such an inappropriate affair. But he obviously feels relaxed and happy with her.At the same time Yale, his best friend, is cheating on his wife by dating a rather extravagant and vivacious girl: Mary. She is not only outspoken but also very critical of the authors and artists that Isaac loves the most. At the beginning he gets infuriated, and he makes it clear.Now that Isaac has turned his back to a very lucrative job on a television network, he must focus on finishing his book, while juggling his responsibilities as a father. His ex-wife (a dashing Meryl Streep) has come out of the closet and lives now with another lesbian; she also plans on writing a book about her marriage and how she let go of bisexuality to embrace homosexuality. Befuddled about the notion of having his private life exposed, Isaac is also having second thoughts about his relationship with high school student Tracy.All the lives, the personalities, all the personal issues collide into each other. That's the beauty of a film like Manhattan. It's constant movement, change, just like life. As soon as one of the characters starts feeling comfortable with a given situation, something new arises. Lovers are there one minute and the next they're gone. This unpredictability is also reinforced by the blunt changes from one scene to the other, the abruptness of such changes provides the viewer with a sense of roughness, of raw-material, almost documentary like, that seems interrupted only by the most sublime musical repertoire. We all know Woody Allen is a music expert, and that is made evident throughout his cinematography.Shot entirely in black and white, 'Manhattan' transforms the chaotic and overpopulated city of New York into the most subjugating and beautiful urban setting. The black and white also adds a special visual depth, which is fundamental for such a personal project like this one.When Yale breaks up with Mary she seeks consolation in Isaac. The two of them hit it off and as a result Isaac decides to put an end to his affair with Mary. Relationships keep changing, evolving, not unlike the men and women that are the protagonists of the film. There are moments of unbiased enlightenment, sequences in which true art converges with true pathos. In the end, though, we've been left bereft; because as everyone should know, things are not easy in life, and not even finding the right person, the one human being that can make you experience love, is the answer. Or, in words of more scintillating wit that come from Isaac himself, this is about \"people in Manhattan who are constantly creating these real, unnecessary neurotic problems for themselves - because it keeps them from dealing with more unsolvable terrifying problems\". But then again, don't we all?",

The best moment of the film is of course the city of Manhattan and the recurrent places in a Woody Allen film:Museums;book shops; restaurants etc especially when we only hear\"Jazz music\" not dialogues.Another great scene is when we see Allen lying on the couch and recommends a list of beloved things like Groucho Marx; Louis Armstrong \"Potato head blues \";Flaubert\"Sentimental Education\";Cezanne paintings;Brando; or Sinatra.

That's not to say that I watch a ton of mind-numbing things, albeit I'll go on the record and say that I do sometimes as well. It's basically about relationships. A 42-year-old man is dating a 17-year old girl, and then falls for a woman that his best friend is cheating on his wife with. Bruh, really? Lol. I would definitely say I found it more interesting than funny, although I did laugh at a few lines. It's kind of like you're just observing these characters grappling with their conflicts. I would say that perhaps one of the parts of this movie that wasn't really needed was the subplot regarding Meryl Streep's character who was one of Woody Allen's ex-wives (he mentions that he has two ex-wives but her character is the only ex-wife in the movie that you see) who was writing a tell-all book about their marriage. The jokes that were produced from their bickering weren't really all that funny to me, nor did it seem to have a ton of consequence altogether. That's very minor stuff, but it still wasn't needed. Streep's character is the only throwaway character in the movie in my opinion because of how she's used. I don't watch a lot of movies in black-and-white, and that's not for a particular reason. I just watch more films shot in color. But this movie looks amazing in black and white. There are many terrific shots. The opening montage at the beginning of the film is a great example. Some of my other favorites took place inside of a museum between Woody Allen and Diane Keaton while they were walking through an art exhibit of the planets and stars, and some driving sequences as well. The cast does a great job as well. Other than that, it's not the most rewatchable movie to me. Perhaps certain scenes are, but I don't know about the whole thing.

As Broadway Danny Rose said - \"Can I interject?\" - well Allen interjects a lot during this film - he lets his comedy seep through into the drama to create a touching Manhattan atmosphere. Thankfully when Allen is on form in this movie, boy is it funny! However, the laughs are not as loud as Annie Hall, nor are they as frequent.Mariel Hemmingway is great as the confused 17 year old that Allen's character Issac goes out with. The subject of a 41 year old man being in a relationship with a younger girl is handled well by Allen. Allen drifts off the Young girl to find more of an \"intellectual\" challenge in Diane Keaton's character. Again, Keaton is fantastic in her role as she was in Annie Hall - this time, not the playful, ditsy Annie, now the serious, analytical Mary.Story wise this movie should be more focused than Annie Hall. Annie Hall was non-linear, this was linear. Instead I found Annie Hall's energy made it much more concentrated movie, as Manhattan sometimes meandered. But that's not to say it's a bad story, it isn't. In fact it's a good one, another realistic look at relationships, but also fusing the \"idyll\" of the relationship we have gained from cinema. The tunes of George Gerscwhin and the cityscape of Manhattan is just beautiful at the beginning of the movie. Allen captures the essence of Manhattan so well, through filming landmarks and iconic imagery.This is one of Allen's best films, with Annie Hall and The Purple Rose of Cairo.It is a more somewhat un-even look at relationships that is as funny to watch as it is serious. Not a bad thing with fantastic performances from the cast, great music and a look so beautiful it is now iconic. Great stuff.",

Just writing that story line makes me laugh. Manhattan is highly funny and Allen's character is so Jewish and so Woody Allen that it is almost like stepping into the life and times of Woody Allen. The tremendous script and chemistry between Woody Allen and Diane Keaton make this film an instant classic. The wooden performances of the best friend (Michael Murphy), the schoolgirl (Mariel Hemingway) and Allen's ex-wife (Meryl Streep) can be ignored and allow the viewer to be charmed and annoyed in equal measure by Isaac Davis (Woody Allen), as he bumbles through life from attempting to run over his ex-wife's lesbian partner to quitting his job as a TV writer to \"focus on his book\".Diane Keaton as Mary Wilkie is the biggest try hard character one could find and only Allen could write this cynical yet delicate part. She floats through with references to religion and Carl Jung, and attempts to camouflage her mental instability and inability to accept life drifting from meaningless relationship to meaningless relationship. The depth of her character is one of the triumphs of the film, as her battle to stay afloat whilst being tugged in a war of love by Yale (Murphy and Isaac (Allen) unfolds.Delving into the heart of the film it showcases the travesties of middle age and the fight to cling onto youth through intellectualism and sex. And ultimately Manhattan is everything not to do when you contemplate life in your 40's, be divorced twice, date a teenager, quit your job. If there is a serious message to be taken away from viewing this film, it is that middle age sucks but sometimes you have to roll with it and not get carried away (evident in the final scene as Isaac stands aghast at the thought of spending 6 months apart from his teenage girlfriend as she shrugs).As ever Allen's comedic timing and contextual references make this film essential Woody viewing and kept me smiling throughout.",

It doesn't put the viewer in a troubled position, nor it makes you feel sad. And the dialogues are incredibly easy to follow, which is important because, just like in every Woody Allen movie, the characters talk all the time, about everything. Which is why all relationships in Woody Allen movies' seem so real, so relatable. Because, after all, being in a relationship means spending extensive amounts of time with someone, most probably talking, and getting to know each other.Even when the movie was finishing, I was wondering what was about it that it made it such a great movie. After all, the plot is really simple, and yes, it has great images of New York and very good music and acting, but that alone does not make a movie great, right? Then I figured out that what is so great about Manhattan is its simplicity, the really good time that it makes you have, the laughs, and the very human characters. Isaac, Woody Allen's character, is especially easy to feel identified with, at least for me, partly because he is always worried about the impression he makes on other people.What I keep from this movie, above all, are some truly memorable quotes, such as: \"My analyst warned me, but you were so beautiful I got another analyst.\" \"-Facts? I got a million facts at my fingertips. -That's right, and they don't mean a thing, right? Because nothing worth knowing can be understood with the mind. Everything really valuable has to enter you through a different opening, if you'll forgive the disgusting imagery.\"\"-You are so self-righteous, you know. I mean we're just people. We're just human beings, you know? You think you're God. -I... I gotta model myself after someone.\"\"I can't express anger. That's one of the problems I have.

            "content": "Manhattan is a romantic comedy by Woody Allen, starring him, along with Diane Keaton, Mariel Hemingway and Meryl Streep. Allen portrays Issac, a TV writer who falls in love with his best friend's mistress, while having an affair with a 17-year old student.I was expecting a lot of this film, maybe a first class drama that will make me cry or feel really bad at the end, because of the opinions and reviews I had read. Having watched \"Deconstructing Harry\" recently, I am disappointed by the fact that these two shared many similarities. The major character of both films is the same guy, he is a writer, he is clever, nervous and cynical. The final act is almost the same as well. Even the relationship between him and his best friend is the same, opponents for the same woman. Still, I liked \"Deconstructing Harry\" much more.The one thing I loved about this one is the cinematography. It managed to show the beauty of Manhattan, even in black and white. It was a beautiful trip around this majestic city. The acting was good enough. It couldn't be other way with this cast. The soundtrack was awesome too, it managed to show the greatness of New York. One last thing I liked was the dialogues, rich and clever.The storyline was very simple, just a love story between some people, nothing great. Also, all those references by Isaac (Allen) were very tiring, I tried hard to keep up with and to understand. As I already said, the fact that I had recently watched \"Deconstructing Harry\", made this one unoriginal in my eyes, even if it was released first.Summing up, it was a movie with good elements, but nothing great. I would recommend it only for its cinematography. I give it 5/10",

Cynical New Yorkers seem to be Woody Allen's forte and here he wastes no time in getting to the heart of his character.  Allen plays Isaac Davis, a successful comedy writer whose wife (played here by a very young Meryl Streep in one of her earliest performances), having left him for another woman, is now embarking on a book about their failed marriage.  Isaac happily consoles himself in the arms of an adoring seventeen year old schoolgirl (played by Mariel Hemingway in an Academy Award nominated performance) until he meets someone closer to his own age, journalist Mary Wilke (played by Annie Hall's Diane Keaton), who also happens to be his best friend's mistress!If this plotline fails to confuse you then the film itself certainly will at times.  Andrew Sarris of the Village Voice called Manhattan \"the only truly great American film of the 1970's\", but upon seeing it you wonder how many other films from that decade there would have been for him to choose from. Not many.  Art certainly did end up imitating life in this film with Woody Allen divorcing Mia Farrow for Soon-yi Previn (a woman many years his junior) years later.  Frankly, this is a good film with a witty screenplay (also nominated for an Academy Award as well) but alas, I think that Allen left a lot of holes in the storyline development.  Still, though this film is a classic of the genre that is Woody Allen.  Do yourself a favor and see this one at least once.  The use of George Gershwin songs as the score is to die for!My rating: 3 stars",

While in \"Annie Hall\" he provided a hilarious view into human relationships in a big city, but that on its sketchy structure (although very funny) failed to be really moving, in \"Interiors\" he tried to do a Bergman-style movie about the same subject and failed absolutely. Here he mixes way better the drama and comedy elements and makes a much better movie.The acting is over the top, and some of them get too little screen time, like Meryl Streep or Mariel Hemingway. Hemingway's character is truly lovely (although some people find it annoying). All the characters are good and the aproach is so good that we (or, at least, I) feel simpathy for all of them.Very good and worth seeing more than one time. Beautifully shot also by Gordon Willis, and with a lot of great Gershwin music for background.SAY NO MORE",

            "content": "Manhattan might just be one of the best movies ever. Its style, themes and humor are obviously similar to other Allen movies, but this one has a touch of class and beauty that makes it quite unique. It talks about a group of new york intellectuals: Isaac (Woody Allen), a man on his 40's dating a 17 year old girl, Tracy (Mariel Hemingway), and lusting for Mary (Diane Keaton), who's his best friend's lover. At the same time, he's trying to come to terms with his lesbian ex-wife, Jill (Meryl Streep). The story keeps you hooked, and the realistic, very flawed characters are interesting. The dialogs have a lot of wit and intelligence, as in all Woody movies, but there's something else: some of the scenes with Mariel Hermingway are heartbreaking, and a lot of others are dramatic and sad. The storyline and the characters are some of the best ever, the nostalgic mood and the insignificance of these lives are just beautiful.The acting is simply great, and all the actors have a good chemistry between them. Woody Allen plays himself, but damn well, Diane Keaton is funny and good, too, but Mery Streep and especially Mariel Hemingway steal the show. MerylStreep plays a totally different character, I had never seen her like this before. She has the funniest delivery of lines, the best way of disappearing into her character ands showing all type of emotions. Mariel Hemingway transmits beauty, innocence and love in a pure, believable way. Her character is the most likable and she makes the most out of that.The gorgeous cinematography helps making this movie great and gives it its ambiance and mood. The simple way Allen shoots the movie, with wide shots that capture a moment, a feeling, an emotion subtly, lets it breathe. It shows you New York with a lot of beauty and obviously Allen's love comes across. The editing is simple but effective, and there's not one second of the movie that shouldn't be there. Simply brilliant (and there's so much more I should have said).",

            "content": "I often compare the cinematic one-two punch of Annie Hall and Manhattan with the stereophonic one-two punch of Revolver and Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.Manhattan began life simply as the follow-up to Annie Hall, much like Pepper began life as simply the next Beatles record. Little did anyone know, upon release, what awe-inspiring masterpieces both would be.The first few scenes were funny and enjoyable enough, but the film really burst wide open with Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) and Mary Wilkie (Diane Keaton) taking a stroll through Manhattan after a feminist fund-raiser, accompanied by \"Someone to Watch Over Me\". From then on, it was clearly a masterpiece.Basically, all of the scenes could stand on their own as brief comic sketches, which is ironic when you consider Isaac had recently quit his job as a writer for a comedy sketch series.There are also great performances by Meryl Streep as the bi-sexual ex-wife who leaves Isaac for another woman and writes an \"honest account of our break-up\" and Mariel Hemingway as Isaac's 17 year-old love interest, Tracy, whose part would be very badly acted by \"you-name-her\" if this film were made today.This movie is absolutely fabulous. Gordon Willis's cinematography is masterful in black and white, as reflected through Isaac's view of New York, and the Gershwin music seems like is was written exclusively for this film. This is how romantic comedy should be portrayed, not like the modern-day ones in which the fat, bad-haired male schlub is a total klutz, who runs around with his man-boobs flopping in the breeze, yet the young, anorexic, seemingly-sophisticated blonde falls madly in love, while popping her eyes out of her socket and exclaiming, \"Oh, like, my, totally, GAWD!\" Seth Rogan and Katherine Heigl were infants at the time of Manhattan's release, if they were even born at all, and watching this great work of art brings me back to those good old days.Watching this film is like an event - you're really into it while it runs its course, then, after it's over, you take it with you everywhere you go - you still feel the impact of it - and that's what a great film really is.",

            "review_title": "Glittering with grandeur in monochrome.",
            "content": "Having released in 1979, Manhattan is a movie that was shot in black- and-white, though it didn't have to be. But that clever move is one of the most delightful characteristics of the film. Seeing New York is monochrome, its diners, its snow-covered streets, its pavements, people going about their moribund lives, its buildings - skyscrappers and the common-man's abode, its skyline, the sunset, the city by the night and firecrackers in the dark give Woody Allen's beloved city an unearthly yet heart-warming touch. Through his initial four-minute montage backed with a witty monologue, Mr. Allen not only manages capture the beauty of New York in gorgeous B&W, but only gifts it an ode in one of the best comedies the world has seen, and that is probably the greatest gift a mortal can present a city with. Manhattan, as the title so subtly suggests, is set in the town of Manhattan, New York. Centering around Isaac (Woody Allen), a 42 year-old balding man, his predicaments - like preventing his second-now-lesbian wife from publishing a tell-all book about their marriage - and conundums - like dating a 17-year old high-schooler Tracy (Mariel Hemingway) or his best friend's mistress Mary (Diane Keaton). That is all the movie has to offer in terms of a 'solid plot line.' What the rest of the film is about how Isaac handles each of his issues. He meets Mary, who at that time is dating his married friend Yale (Michael Murphy) and forms an initial impression of hers as a 'little yo-yo' before falling in love with her. He tries talking his ex-wife into not publishing the book, who remains adamant as a brick. He asks his high- school girlfriend to move to London and to remember him as a 'fond memory,' with a Casablanca-esque touch. And in classic Woody Allen- fashion, he fails, in accomplishing almost everything. Movies by Woody Allen hardly rely on events in films to carry them through. Instead, they work on the characters, dialogues, tracking days as they fly-by without merely focusing on D-days. And that is where Manhattan derives its beauty from. Take the characters, for instance. All of them have distinct personalities - Isaac is the neurotic and highly intelligent protagonist, Mary is the beautiful and dilemma- stricken divorced woman looking for love, Tracy is the innocuous teenager who lacks the ability to distinguish infatuation from love, while Yale is the adulterer playing the balancing act on boats heading different ways. The dialogue is always the highlight of any Woody Allen film, since the man pays special attention to it, often writing the script himself. Manhattan keeps the precedent he set in Annie Hall alive. The dialogue, especially mouthed by the nebbish Isaac is sharp, witty, though often hurtful and cynical. It won't make you laugh out loud, but will make you silently smile and marvel at the intellect of the man and the delivery. It is spontaneous; seemingly impromptu, which adds to the authenticity of the delivery. Here is man whose believes that the best pick-up line in his arsenal is 'I had a mad impulse to throw you down on the lunar surface and commit interstellar perversion.' Crazy, or what? The soundtrack really strikes you as definitive in the film. In a way, with its old-school instrumentals and symphonies, topped with trumpets and violins, the soundtrack gives the movie an archaic feel, like cinema originally had. That, perhaps, is Mr. Allen's ode to the real-movies they had in old times. The cinematography, too, is breathtaking, the kind that makes you want to revel in it. The interplay between shades of black and white is gorgeous, and is naturally appealing to any movie aficionado.Manhattan is a film whose humour cannot be explained, you have to experience it yourself. It is very niche; if a bar has to be set to differentiate between people who got real jokes and ones that didn't, I would call it the Woody Allen Line. His humour surpases almost everything else I have seen in movies - not slapstick, but subtle, gentle and intellectual - the kind you either love, or don't get at all. In a world where every comedy film tries to be the canon, Manhattan remains the arrow, but the latter is always the true test of marksmanship. After his supposed magnum opus Annie Hall, Woody Allen goes ahead and tops it up with a better Manhattan. He matures and mellows as a director, not resorting to slip-on-the-banana-peel humour anymore. The film is aesthetically appealing and reeks of sheer brilliance. However, these very words remind me of another film - Annie Hall. Comparisons? Inevitable, since Manhattan looks like a closely related cousin born two years later. We'll have them another time, because that will be another chapter entirely. But I do personally believe, that Manhattan remains the genius's true opus.",

            "content": "From the very beginning of George Gershwin's dazzling \"Rhapsody in Blue\" at the start of Woody Allen's 1979 film Manhattan, you can feel the genuine nature of the passion of this film, and the artistry to boot. It will suffice to say, it's undoubtedly one of Woody Allen's masterpieces. Allen plays a twice-divorced New Yorker, Isaac, on the brink of a mid-life crisis: he is struggling with his career and is dating a 17 year old girl (Mariel Hemingway). His best friend (Michael Murphy) is having an affair with culturally savvy Mary (Diane Keaton), the clash of classes so obviously seen. Despite the differences, Isaac falls for Mary and Mary falls for Isaac, quite the relational web for these characters, but so much more deep than one would imagine. Manhattan evokes some sort of lost romanticism, the most effective use of idealized post- modern charm. It's both relaxing and utterly thrilling, with Allen's usual notions of his passion and love for New York, shown brilliantly in Gordon Willis' black and white cinematography, which manages to highlight the beauty of New York, wrapped up in the gritty industrialism. Every nuance of the film has New York written all over it. From the iconic places and iconic music, it creates some iconic visuals. It is Allen's adoration of the city and for cinema itself that make it an intimate spectacle on the backdrop of the epic concrete jungle.The relationships and characters are as lively and complex as the gorgeous city around them. The way Manhattan never gives easy answers for it's characters is one of the strengths of this film, and certainly one of the biggest weaknesses of the modern romantic comedy. He writes these characters as real human beings, with depth beyond adolescent themes and more into his common exploration of psychology and sexual desire, among other things. He really knows how to bring out the best in his cast. There is not a single performance that could be considered less than authentically magnificent, and Allen's top-notch writing certainly helps. Diane Keaton gives another effortless performance, and she fits this film so perfectly: independent, confused, but ultimately bearing psychological American complexities that drive her character to choose what she chooses in the end. Mariel Hemingway is the most subtle, perhaps because of the ingenuity of her character, but always acting so true to form, as if she is living the life of her character and her transitions from bright-eyed-young-girl to bright- eyed-young-woman are done brilliantly. Of course Woody Allen is especially earnest, and throw in Meryl Streep and you've got one of the best casts ever assembled. It's such a romantic and charming story of loss, that you almost forget that Isaac is so wistful (like Allen himself), but he does what he does out of passion; for his city, for his love, and ultimately for himself.

Isaac (Woody) has a relationship with a 17-year old girl, but he knows that can't last (or can it?) and wants to find something else. Enter Mary. Even though Mary is involved with Yale (who himself is married), Isaac finds her intriguing and isn't sure what to do.Meanwhile he has quit his job as a television writer and is working on a novel that seems to be going nowhere. He needs to cut back on spending and has to move to an apartment that makes strange noises and has brown water, but Isaac loves the town as much as ever.

            "content": "Love triangles, illicit affairs, neurotic banter and strange chemistry: these things are all trademarks of every drama Woody has made in the last 15 years, and all of these elements came together for the first time in \"Manhattan\". Like most film buffs and Woody Allen fans, I like \"Manhattan\" very much. It's funny, engaging film that is also a feast for the ears and eyes. And just like real every day life, the film unfolds with a series of haphazard events. I can also relate to this film on a very personal level, but I won't go into those reasons as they're inconsequential. I'll go into the film by saying it is hard to really like any of the characters in this film; most of them are hopelessly self-involved and tragically misinformed. You know you're in trouble when Woody's character is the most level-headed in the picture! But for me that only aids the film's realism; we spend every day of our lives involving ourselves in ill-advised and even ignorant activities. Woody's characters aren't the typical Julia Roberts and Freddie Prinz Jr's that always say and do the right thing at the right moment. Being able to portray people the as they are-individuals with real faults and genuine problems-has always been one of the director's strengths. One of the main ideas of the film is that cerebral people purposely, albeit maybe subconsciously, create their own troubles. The virtue of being intelligent, cultured, admired and perhaps even wealthy is not enough for these people. Or perhaps it's too much. The characters here dig their own graves so to speak and later hate themselves for it-but it's the only they can function. I think like-minded people will agree with me that many so-called \"happy\" individuals in this world mindlessly wander through life, content with their television commercials and fast food and shopping malls and Julia Roberts movies. The same thing taht allows these people to be perfectly happy is possibly the same thing that drives more open-minded folks to challenge everything, including their own well-being. I imagine I am getting way off track now, but I feel everything that I am saying has some relevance to the film. Maybe that's all subjective, but that's what I take from the film. The thing I can most objectively identify from \"Manhattan\" would have to be the gorgeous photography coupled with a beautiful George Gershwin score. I think that is the first thing people usually notice about this film, the fact that it is a very loving homage from the director to the only place in the world he would want to call home. The story, to me anyway, has little relation to the setting-these kind of situations can happen in any city in the world. That's part of the beauty of this film-it has 2 very different objectives; part human drama and part love letter to NYC, Woody Allen blends the 2 ideas seamlessly to create a minor masterpiece.",

Relationships and life are messy and complex, and Woody's narrative shows this so effortlessly, I think, that people overlook how complex and elegant this movie is.  It's also shot beautifully in B&W, and the all-Gershwin soundtrack is sublime.  As always, Woody's story and character are semi-autobiographical, and in retrospect, his real-life affair with/marriage to Soon-Yi makes his relationship in the story to a 17-year old Mariel Hemingway a little needlessly weighty.

The dialogue is quick and funny at times and the fact that Allen decided to film in black and white was an interesting decision but seemed to capture the beauty of \"Manhattan\".I think there are many different interpretations people can have about what this movie is about but to me, it seemed to come down to a character played by Allen, \"Ike\", who wasn't sure what he wanted. He lives a complex life and seems to make relationships of both friends and lovers much more complicated than it has to be by his own conduct and views on things. The character development of Ike with his relationship with his young girlfriend and then having an affair with his friend Yale's wife was anxiety producing and funny. Allen captured a lot of what Manhattan is known for, culture, art and sophistication. I enjoy the actual borough of Manhattan and love visiting but I am not sure that I would want to actually know and be friends with a character like Ike.",

The opening black and white scenes of Manhattan, set to the pitch of \"Rhapsody in Blue\" by George Gershwin makes NYC come alive like it never has before. Then, we get to the story, with a group of neurotic New Yorkers struggling to keep their emotional lives in tact. Mariel Hemingway is absolutely fantastic above all the others, she breathes pure sensitivity into her part as Woody's teen-aged lover. \"Manhattan\" was Allen's first effort to capture the spirit of NYC as a whole and its intellectual community. However, this film functions as more than a love note to New York, it also is a highly personal movie about romance, friendship, and intellectual angst.",

            "content": "I just re-watched this movie recently. I loved it in college, and thought Woody was a genius. The dialogue and story are still great, the cinematography is beautiful, and New York City shines as a majestic, romantic city. Woody's depiction of the neurotic intellectual elite crowd in Manhattan is entertaining and hilarious.But today I see something sinister here that I didn't twenty years ago. Maybe it has to do with the whole twisted Soon Yi-Mia business that happened in the subsequent years. Maybe it's because now that I'm the age of Ike Davis, I realize how screwed up it is for a guy in his forties to be dating a high school student. Maybe now that I have daughters of my own, I know I'd never want them to get involved with a 42 year-old guy when they were still wearing braces.Strip away the learned banter about Kafka and Bergman, the great black and white shots of the city, the wry, pithy remarks from Ike, and this movie essentially glorifies and presents as healthy what is legally considered statutory rape. If you want to be really blunt about it, you might say that this movie is a pedophile's fantasy. Ike Davis's manipulation and mistreatment of Tracy is ultimately treated as not such a bad thing. Tracy, the pure, sweet, yet sexually wild nymphet (talk about the pedophile's fantasy!) accepts it all, and remains loyal to her 42 year-old man. Ike's constant complaints to his friends about how he realizes Tracy is too young and how he has to get out of the relationship are supposed to show that he's not some predatory sicko but a normal guy who shares the audience's moral perspective.Yet he ultimately discards any concerns he has about the propriety of his relationship with Tracy. He concludes that his relationship with Tracy is the best one he's ever had with a \"woman\" and wants her to cancel her 6-month trip to London so she can get back together with him. She tells Ike that had he come to her a week earlier, she might have considered it. But not to worry, says Tracy: \"What's six months if we both love each other?\". Despite Ike having cheated on her, dumped her, and repeatedly told her that he's unwilling to commit to her, Tracy still regards him as her true love. So again, it's the pedophile's fantasy: this isn't an abusive, inappropriate relationship--it's true love! Ike's mistreatment of Tracy and taking advantage of her childlike na\u00efvet\u00e9 is not morally wrong--see, she still loves him and wants more! The best partner for a 42 year-old accomplished intellectual man is not an accomplished intellectual woman the same age like Diane Keaton's character--no, it's a girl in high school! I read an article in the NY Times recently about how, given the increased awareness of sexual abuse of children that has emerged since 1979, a movie like Manhattan could never get made today. That's probably not such a bad thing. Back in the 80s, I read a glowing review of Manhattan that talked about Ike Davis's smile in the final scene when Tracy tells him he has to have a little more faith in people. That smile was so profound, said the reviewer, the perfect expression of the complex emotions in the lives of these elite intellectual New Yorkers. I agreed with the reviewer 20 years ago. But when I re-watched the movie the other day, all I could think was that if it was my daughter this guy was preying on, if I saw that smile I'd want to punch him in the face.",

I have never seen a more beautiful visual love letter to New York as this one, in which Woody Allen manages to encapsulate all he adores about NY to a gorgeous score and a razor sharp screenplay.With a dynamic ensemble cast including Diane Keaton as a neurotic intellectual, marvellous Meryl Streep (looking lovely!) as Allen's lesbian ex-wife, and Mariel Hemmingway as the teenage object of Allen's affections, the witty screenplay is brought to life with humour and also a little pathos.The city of New York is, as any visitor or inhabitant will know from experience, magical, and Allen captures this essence in 'Manhattan'. The film looks stunning in black and white, and the accompanying Gershwin score feels as if it were written specially to be used by Allen.At the end of the film, Woody Allen's character lists all that he feels is wonderful about life. If I had to make the same list, this film would feature. It is a true classic and is not to be missed. I rate 'Manhattan' and 'Annie Hall' as Woody Allen's finest accomplishments.",

I am personally watching all Woodie Allen movies. I watched \"Bananas\", \"Everything you always wanted to know about sex\" and this is the third one I'm watching. Well, I would say that his style has grown a lot. So stylish now, If in the first comedy we can see the genius and silly curiosity of the young director. Now his style is clear: Love at first place, and always focusing on the relationship between man and woman, not from man side, not from woman side. Just on the Relationship between them. So innocent and at the same time effective. I love the way he is able to makes the audience see all the 360\u00b0 spectrum of couple's issues. Great, absolutely great. And at my 25 years old age I can say I saw myself in ALL of them! How forward Woodie is.If I gotta say a critic to balance I still think he could be a little bit more into the situations, too much into his ironic character I think, but this is a personal opinion, and I'm just say this because I think he is great and soo hard to find something not good in his Terrific works.So 9/10. Great prove of Meryl Streep, I really appreciate the innocent passion of the Heminghway, terrific in the last scene, and good choice of B/W. The only color mentioned was \"The brown water\".Absolutely to watch, I'm so sorry I just saw it at 25 years old!!! And by the way...I'm watching it over again!See ya, Roberto",

Woody Allen blends romance with comedy effortlessly with a script that's loaded with humour, intelligence and wit. The film boats excellent performances from all of it's cast, most notably Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. The main character in the film however is Manhattan itself, the cinematography of the film really is something to behold, possibly the best looking film I've ever seen. The visuals coupled with the excellent soundtrack add an extra layer of the depth and beauty to the film, perfectly capturing the feel of the city.

            "content": "Manhattan: A DVD Movie ReviewThis is my second favorite Woody Allen film, funny, but the one I cry over, the one that elicits anguish, the one that makes me think about morality, and what is right and wrong. The George Gershwin music track and black and white cinematography of the great city of New York are compelling cinema, in this unique work of late 20th century art. An amazing movie but, despite being alarming funny, it is so very sad. Is it Woody's aim as a filmmaker to make the audience laugh and cry at the same time? Perhaps. Woody is very clever, but he is no genius, and because he thinks he is, this is downfall. Regardless, \"Manhattan\" is a truly great film.Once again Diane Keaton is Woody's straight woman amongst shtick, and in this cinema she is heartbreakingly beautiful. Her cheekbones rise and fall to new heights and lows, and her lyrical voice and disarming gestures are frankly hard not to fall in love with. But Diane is not alone as cast in this fascinating film, as there are many other supportive actors and actresses in this story, all very good, and all necessary to tell the story.The story is about a TV script writer, played by Woody, that tires of the mundane and phony grind of the everyday. He is admired by New York's culture for being intellectual and witty, but he can't take the phoniness of it anymore and quits his job to pen the great American novel. Of course, without money, or a job, a man is a bum, and this eats away at the Allen character.Within the thread of this brilliant film is a tall tiny fragile flower. A 17 year old girl that has a serious infatuation with the 42 year old Woody character. Telling is a moment of dialog in this film, when Diane Keaton's character asks this young girlfriend, Tracy was her name, what she does, and she innocently and primly says \"I go to High School\". This sets a sort of tone to the emotional end to this film. This young girl was portrayed with a sad and final very hard bitten lesson, by a young actress with an ethereal beauty in one Mariel Hemingway. And finally I can't omit, an ex-wife of Woody's character, playing a lesbian, an act that is so very out of character, in a very early role, of one stunning blond in Meryl Streep.The final chapter in this very good story is about that young afore mentioned High School girl. When Mariel, as Tracy, implores, and looks at the imploring heel played by Woody, and says, \"You really hurt me\", this little line says it all. Young people should not mix around with the old, because it is the old that controls the emotion of love. I know that all too well having had to deal with age differences in relationships. But still . . .To really experience this movie, and the failure of human relationships contained within, is to imagine you are Tracy, the young girl acted, aptly, and so very sadly by Mariel Hemingway. She breaks my heart every time in black and white weeping. It is how I view this film and when I feel her hurt, I really take in this experience, and I feel young, but betrayed by love and age.This film is a 1970's period piece. Manhattan's sky line is old. The cars are relics. The human relationships are a clich\u00e9 of that era. That is, except, for the love that the young Tracy feels for Woody Allen's character Isaac. And through all the weaving in and out of lies, cheating, and what could be, it is the young woman's love, for an older man, that is brought forth as true. Woody realizes this almost too late, but you have that feeling, that that spring and fall relationship will not work. Because in the end, it is the young girl who grows up, illustrating the immaturity of Woody's character. Classic stuff.A really great film, despite the director's excuses, I give it 9 out of 10 stars.B. A. Draper",

It is a film that goes beyond just being a romantic comedy, has sad moments, happy, funny, romantic, etc. .. everything as it happens in real life, and leads the characters through all these emotions in a natural way, so that nothing feels forced.It shows a contrast between the protagonist and his goals in life, because in general we see him as a person \"failed\" who wants to get high, but he seriously believes he can achieve it, and there's much of the comedy and he creates empathy with the public, because it is a very human character.It's a comedy that could be called \"serious\" because, in general, what is laughable is how the characters face common situations that could happen to anyone. The script is written so that the story flows very fast, every time something happens, it has a lot of dialogue, but it works because it is not explanatory, but it gives the viewer the information he needs to know at that time, no all he wants to know.Allen shows us a project that embodies much of his thinking, his outlook on life and we see this primarily with the protagonist, who seeks love, to make sense of life and fill a void.",

            "content": "I'm not sure if Manhattan is Woody Allen's greatest film, but I have agreed with the overwhelming vote of other reviewers that it's great--until I saw it again a few weeks ago, and I remembered why I also disliked it. I haven't read all of the reviews, but the recent ones seem to dodge the key issue--why would anyone like 'Manhattan'? The problems are obvious: the Allen and Keaton characters should make any normal viewer want to puke. Then the movie celebrates NYC by implying that these characters deserve our sympathetic attention and identification. The prime example, Allen's character, is frankly grotesque. He's an obviously total scumbag in connection with Hemingway, but in all other ways, too. He even hogs the basketball when he picks up his son to pass an afternoon away. When Keaton voices interesting ideas, he responds with dumb self-centered whining--God, his character is one trait = whine. Of course, to balance things, writer Allen makes Keaton's character almost equally puke-worthy--interpersonally dishonest, pathologically insecure but still smugly self-promoting.... A flaw in the film is that Hemingway's honesty and maturity can't be articulated in the space of the other characters; her final speech sounds too good to be true, so maybe she's just learned to lie the New Yorker way in rationalizing self-centered choices, as opposed to really maintaining a commitment to Allen.I don't think these are insights--I imagine that Allen the auteur would agree, all of the film characters actually do agree when they have occasion to reflect and edge toward honesty...they're the raw material of the film. But the characters go on to be fascinating, dynamic, somewhat sympathetic, maybe even prototypical of NYC. How does this black (yes, evil, I'd affirm--we should, but do not, blanch at Allen's treatment of Hemingway in the last scene) magic happen? Why do we consent to the puke and find the humor and life? Possible answers: They're anti-heroes--no, antiheroes have positive dispositions (see Annie Hall), missing here. They're clinically interesting--no, they're too appealing for that. They're comic--yeah, but the 'Manhattan' character arc is not the 3 Stooges. They're 'real'--no, frankly, Allen comes too close to giving us the 3 Stooges; the people, even the New Yorkers, I know are not bad like this.I'm married to a New Yorker, so maybe I'm just a sucker for the NYC vibe, but my wife, past the fast talk, is a lot like the Hemingway character in earnestness. I have no good answer, but I fear that people who totally love the film may be getting brainwashed past the basic contradiction.",

            "content": "I can't think of a more charming and thought provoking movie about dating and relationships than Manhattan. It possesses such realistic dialog and probing commentary on the desperate nature of human beings in search of love. Also it demonstrates Woody's unrequited love for Manhattan, which is firmly stated in the introductory narration. Although I haven't been to Manhattan, I have read numerous accounts stating that Woody Allen has captured the essence of Manhattan in this movie. This is what it feels like. Through Allen's lenses we are also seeing what a City is supposed to be.I was amused to see Woody Allen's character Isaac sticking up for the 'only genius' he knows in Cinema - Ingmar Bergman. Referring to a new acquaintance who is the lover of his best friend, Isaac says to his 17 year old girlfriend, '...if she had made one more remark about Bergman, I would've knocked her other contact lens out.' The dialog is so sharp that it's always one step ahead of the viewer. You really don't know where the next frenetic thought of Allen will take you. Just don't expect someone to shrug their shoulders, slap their forehead and with mid-rising intonation say d'uh! It's not that kind of comedy. It's not the show, 'Friends'. Manhattan contains perplexing and often dark adult humor. The other aspect of Manhattan which struck me was just how influential it must have been on the hugely successful 90's sit com Seinfeld and the subsequent Larry David self mockumentary, Curb your Enthusiasm. The characterizations and conversation themes are just too similar. Elaine Benes is almost a direct copy of Diane Keating's 'Mary'. Her mannerisms, modern feminism attitude and even her outfits have an uncanny resemblance to Allen's Mary. Jason Alexander did say in the Seinfeld Chronicles that when he auditioned he did basically a straight up imitation of Woody Allen. 'It was all Woody' or words to that effect.Woody Allen is a wonderful actor. It wasn't something I had fully appreciated until seeing this. The real eye opener for me however was his 17 year old lover played by Mariel Hemmingway. Her sensitivity and vulnerability shone so brightly - a truly incredible and touching performance, and from one so young.Oh and other things like the irrepressibly beautiful soundtrack and cinematography. Well that would require another review to mention the superlatives of each.I found Manhattan a completely different movie to Annie Hall, but in an improved sense. The story seemed to have more vigor and I admired the acting a heck of a lot more. I might have been expecting too much from Annie since it was my first Allen movie and it had been parodied to death. I need to see both movies again to be more conclusive about which I like better. One thing is for certain, 'Manhattan' is a fantastic dating movie. If you want something to provoke an insightful relationship conversation with your better half, then Manhattan is it! I'm looking forward to seeing Hannah and her Sisters next. Supposedly Allen didn't like Manhattan, which surprises me, but I wonder was it because its totality or essence was a bit close to home? I've noticed his more recent movies involve stories which far less encapsulate an 'introspective' Woody and more driven towards showcasing other uniquely neurotic characters and harder driven stories and plots.It's this Jewish humour (is this the Lenny Bruce genre everyone talks about?), which undoubtedly is my favourite style of humour because it is so witty and introspective and doesn't belittle the audience's intelligence.... on the contrary.The verdict? This is essential 'Allen', me thinks, despite what Woody may think.",

It is deeply heartfelt - the scene in which Isaac is lying on the couch listing the reasons why life, for him, is worth living was one of the finest scenes ever.  Mariel Hemingway was wonderful - her Tracy was a great creation to begin with - a real, wise, not immature, but still young girl.  And the character was fleshed out beautifully in the performance.  \"Manhattan\" is a lovely picture postcard - an homage to a legendary city, a fresh meditation on this tricky life/love business each of us has to go through.  But, as I've already written, for the greatest examination of love Allen has ever conceived, see \"The Purple Rose of Cairo.\"  And then see \"Manhattan.\"  Both are luminous.",

From an emotional point of view, this film has more resonance than, say, Annie Hall, or Sweet and Lowdown, although those two films had plenty of emotion. Manhattan was clearly made by someone who just loves making films, and it shows. Woody Allen's love affair with New York is obviously on display here, and this movie contains his absolute his finest shots. And he doesn't hedge his bets with the shots in this movie, from the wide expansive shots of the city to the way he incorporates the set, to the way he takes advantage of spacial orientation, this film contains Allen's most interesting work from a purely technical point of view. There's nothing that's clever-clever like in Annie Hall, all the interesting shots in Manhattan serve to increase the emotional impact, and the film is quite interesting to look at simply for the way he frames almost every shot. The characters and the story in this movie are also wonderful, as is the music, all George Gershwin tunes. Manhattan is truly one of the great cinematic achievements of the 20th century is one of the best movie's I've ever seen.",

            "content": "Manhattan is a truly amazing film from Woody Allen. It has everything anyone could want from a movie: it's funny, witty, smart, beautiful, romantic, yet also very emotionally devastating. It's ultimately a movie about love, the loss of it, and what's truly important in life. It boasts some amazing directing work, great performances from the whole cast, as well as a look, sound, and feel that completely defines New York City. The story centers around five people and the relationships between each and every one of them. It shows how these relationships grow and change, which is really interesting to see. The standout performance in this film comes from Diane Keaton, who plays the role of an emotionally troubled divorc\u00e9e who cant decide what exactly she wants out of life. Even though her world seems to be falling apart, and she talks in a completely pessimistic way, she always manages to charm the audience, as well as be the character in the film you're the most attached to emotionally. All of the other actors are just as astounding, and they really get into their characters and become a part of this movie. Even though the performances are great, the main draw of this movie is the direction. This is arguably Woody Allen's best directing ever, absolutely everything about it perfectly describes New York. The visual style (shot in all black and white to add to the effect), the way it's shot, the musical score, and the dialog are all incredibly beautiful, and this is truly the greatest love letter to New York ever to be put on film. This story is funny, romantic, but overall really heartbreaking and eye-opening. It teaches the all-important lesson that no matter how hard you search for love, the only person you're ever meant to be with is always someone that you let go. However, the way it goes about reaching this conclusion is not at all cheesy, mostly because the performances are so incredibly convincing. Overall, this is a beautiful and brilliant movie, truly one of the first great romantic comedies. From the genius opening scene right down to the end credits, this is truly a masterpiece of cinema that should be essential viewing for all film lovers, or for people who simply love Manhattan.",

            "content": "This is one big spoiler, so don't bother reading this if you don't want part of the movie to be ruined.  Sorry.So, I had just watched Interiors with a friend and remarked that the problem I had with the majority of existentialism films and characters is that they make everything so depressing.  Now I love Crimes & Misdemeanors.  It is one of the greatest existential movies ever made, but damn, if it isn't depressing.  Alright, I understand that the world can be a horrible place. I understand that life doesn't play fair.  I'll even concede that there are no rules to life except those that we make.  But why would people continue if this is how they see life?My standpoint has always been that existentialism doesn't have to be depressing.  If you look at it from the standpoint that each moment is precious because there is nothing afterwards, it makes each moment of joy meaningful because it is simply that - joy.  Therefore the reasons to continue living are those things that bring you joy.  And the hope of future joy.What Woody Allen has done with Manhattan is bring that theory to life. Unlike his other serious existential movies (Interiors and Crimes & Misdemeanors) he uses his humor to show that joy.  And in the end when he realizes what will make him happy he jumps at it.  And like life, it isn't easily obtained.  It has to come through hope.  And trust.  And patience.Woody said that after the success of Annie Hall and the complete harsh objectiveness of Interiors he wanted to use the humor of Annie Hall to bring out the important messages he had to say with Interiors.  With Manhattan he did that beautifully.  And although I think there might be too much humor, it is one of the best movies to deal with human nature from an existential viewpoint ever made.It is one of my favorite movies.  It was a joy to watch it.  There's no higher praise than that.",

I'm sort of new to the whole Allen thing I've only seen \"Sleeper\"(Great comedy) and one of his newer films, \"Hollywood Ending\", where he plays the blind director.  So I'm not an Allen nut in the least.  Haled by many as a great visionary, Woody Allen makes movies that are well put together and done very well.  This movie, well this movie has great composition. Excellent composition and if you want to watch a movie because of that go ahead. If you want to find a movie that will have you rolling on the floor laughing go watch \"Sleeper\". \"Manhattan\"is pretty much a movie showing what is great about Manhattan, and what can sometimes suck about it, if you are a well to do upper middle class citizen.  I enjoyed seeing the city more then I liked watching Allen and his 17 year old girlfriend.  I tend to agree with Meryl Streep's character about who Allen's character is, a self absorbed complainer. Allen does well with these types of characters, he seems to play them a lot. When I think about it though, if I was the Woody Allen Character, I would complain a lot too.  Anyway I watched this movie expecting to see a classic, I ended up disappointed.  Don't get caught up in the hype, if you can enjoy this movie do it if you can't then don't worry its only an hour and a half of your life wasted.",

As long as there are film makers like him, Martin Scorsese, the Coens, Wong Kar-Wai, David Lynch, David Fincher and Bryan Singer then we are guaranteed films which not only entertain but also require a little intellectual work to be done.

I consider myself to be a true film fan, who has come to expect a lot from movies.  The first time i saw \"manhattan\" I was struck by the opening shot.  It is far different from anything else Woody Allen has done.  Being a director, I tend to hold originality far higher than any comedic value this film may offer.  I also tend to look at films a bit differently than most other people i know, that is, people i know not in the business.  The thing that makes Manhattan so much better than anything else Woody Allen has done, is the fact that it has it's own, unique style. Now, put the fact that it is shot in black and white behind you, as it is unimportant stylistically speaking.  (Woody Allen also shot a film called 'zelig' in black and white a year later, therefore destroying any credibility he may have gotten from me for that original move)  The film moves through the scenes as if it weren't shot by Woody Allen at all, moreover, it looks like something a professional director might shoot. Overall, this film is great because of the style, and originality that probably wasn't intended to be there in the first place.",

The film(I don't know if it's necessary told that cause everybody knows)was started by Diane Keaton(it's always a pleasure sow her on screen), Mariel Hemningway(adorable and sexy too)and, of course, the best neurotic of all time, Woody himself. I don't wont to tell much of the story because I don't know if you see or not the film yet( if the answer it's \"no\" please run quickly to your video club right now)but in a few lines we could said that's the story of a middle-age men who after two divorces it's now in a period of his life were he don't know exactly what he wont, he had been seeing a young girl but he don't take the things that going on too seriously, but suddenly all the things of his life had been approach to change from a day to another. But what I really adore of this film, more than any other, was four things:1)the aperture sequence with the gershwing's soundtrack, 2)the black and withe as a way to express a particular perspective of art and life with all it's circumstances, 3)the city in all of his dimensions as anyone could showing after or later and, of course, 4)the brilliant scene were Woody was lied on the couch and, with a record tape turned on, stars to mention all the things in life for what really worth to live up to. In retrospective we are in conditions to confirm that no other picture was so personal and popular at the same time, and the truth is that maybe no other filmmaker made a tribute to the city that he loves(that's all in the monologue of the beginning)and teach us to love it too.",

Towering buildings loom and landmarks stand like vaunted monuments; while the grime can't really be avoided in any depiction of New York ca. 1980, it's downplayed and treated like an oddly cherished part of the city's identity. At one point, we trail along behind a white Mustang as it cruises (alone) near the Hudson, listening in on the conversation between the passengers 30 feet ahead. There's no ambient noise, no traffic, no echoes from ten million other lives. It may not be realistic, but it does certainly look great. \n\nIn this somewhat fictionalized playground of the intelligentsia steps Woody Allen as Isaac Davis, the next name given to the same personality that Allen does in most of classics - fretful, highly educated, verbose, and with a sardonic wit. But that's because his character works so well, and is pretty much endlessly entertaining. Isaac forms the centerpiece of a network of current and former lovers, friends, and colleagues who explore the possibilities of companionship through a series of small-scale encounters and everyday meetings where their sincere discussions are intermixed with heavy doses of humor and sarcasm. The roles are all well-played enough for the film to function as a straight-up comedy, but as the runtime rolls on you begin to see that there is an emotional depth behind it all - nobody is sure of themselves, everyone is making it up as they go along, and the passions are fickle. In this carefully photographed NYC that is beautifully accentuated by the musical talents of George Gershwin, there is a commentary on love and life that will end up hitting surprisingly hard after getting you to let your guard down with some great comedy.\n\nThen you get thrown off by the middle-aged Allen having an openly sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl, and you've got to spend the rest of your day muttering about how \"it was a different time,\" so you can keep liking the film.

I have started a long journey of watching all his movies and after 5 of them, I have to say that all were just so delightful to watch. Manhattan was no different: it is fun, it has a good story, great dialogues and beautiful scenes of his beloved Manhattan. Isaac Davis is the main character here (played by Woody, who mastered in playing this similar character over and over), a 40 years old comedy writer that divorced twice and now continues to look for the one relationship\u00a0of his life.\u00a0He is currently dating a 17 year old girl who seems to adore him and with whom he seems to feel very safe and just himsef. In this relationship he is the experimented one who is in control of things, he seems to consider this as a temporary thing until he is able to find someone with a proper age. This already hints the feeling that shows up constantly in the movie: people expect to know what they want and feel, who they love more and selfishly chose the best option. Of course, reality is much more complicated than that. Yale, Isaac's close friend, has a marriage of more than a decade but is having his third affair with a woman named Mary. They clearly have strong feelings for each other but also feel a (hypocrite?) guilt for the secret relationship. Isaac meets Mary and, while he is completely annoyed in their first interaction by her intelectual arrogance, it already seems that they will be together at some point. As Yale struggles to find time to be with his mistress, Isaac starts to fill that role and gets involved with Mary as their first encounter suggested. After that, the movie goes on to show us more of the feeling pointed out before as people seem to be so concerned about finding their true love (maybe just true for some time) that hurting the others envolved becomes just an inevitable consequence. The turn of events then is as much unpredictable (at least to me) as the connection between Mary and Isaac was on the first encounter, showing how good directors might even use apparently predictable moments at their favor. Woody's direction in fact is one I am starting to appreciate a lot; I loved the initial scenes of Manhattan while he starts his book (already so indecisive about love and how to describe it), the shots that resembles old silent films are also very interesting and the length of most scenes just blew my mind (it must be a true test for good actors). The movie has a nice and simple story which is told at an amazing rythm that just feels like it is how it was supposed to be (no boring sections at all), there are several funny moments as usual, dialogues are simple but sharpe and entertaining and the beautiful wide shots of Manhattan just complete the whole thing. It might not be the most amazing film but what is not to love?",

It may make it easier for the cinematographer and for Allen's storytelling, but it does nothing to illuminate or move along the story.  As a postcard this may work, but as a movie, something fluid and meant to be living, it is limiting and short-sighted.  A very poor choice that cannot be supported rationally.

Isaac (Woody Allen), forty-two and dating a seventeen-year-old definitely didn't age well, even if she (Mariel Hemingway) is the most mature character in the movie. And that might be the biggest issue I had with Manhattan, is that the main cast of characters are largely unlikable in a generally likeable movie. I suppose it's a microcosm of a piece of NYC that still exists today; successful, egotistical, neurotic people making problems for themselves, spending too much on rent, and looking at art. I also could've moved it into the 80s with a better ending. It was so shitty how Isaac treated Tracy, only for the film to want us to want them together in the end. It did give us that gorgeous shot of the Queensboro Bridge, however, even if the bench was never really there.",

            "content": "One of the definitive love letters to New York City this is a film that provided an aspirational vision of adulthood to me at a young age as troubling as that thought was when revisiting the film. Watching the film now I see that it was as brilliant as I thought it was when I first saw it but in different ways as I was now able to look past the glamour of a group of highly intelligent people having conversations about art in a beautiful location to see how lonely all of these people were despite their talents and position in life. I no longer aspire to be divorced and can see that suffering is painful even if you look attractive or have seen several art films. With this ability to look past the surface attractions of the film I could see how it delved into the emotional confusion that people experience when they reach a certain point in their lives and begin to feel lonely.\n\nTelevision writer Isaac Davis, Woody Allen, has left his job ostensibly to write a boom but struggles to formulate ideas. He wallows in the pains he experienced during his relationship with his ex-wife Jill, Meryl Streep, who left him for her lesbian lover and is now writing a tell all book about their marriage. In trying to find himself he has fallen into a relationship with the sexually explorative teenager Tracy, Mariel Hemingway, who he attempts to break up with repeatedly. He eventually leaves her when he falls in love with a woman his own age in the damaged Mary Wilkie, Diane Keaton, who happens to be the former mistress of his married best friend Yale Pollack, Michael Murphy. Davis and Wilkie break up when she returns to Pollack and Davis finds himself alone despite trying to reconcile with Tracy.\n\nFor some this could be considered a better film than Annie Hall (1977), although I still like that film more, as it presents the audience with a tougher ending in that this man never really loved any of the women he was romantically involved with. His relationship with Jill was based on his physical desire for her as he often describes her as attractive while failing to take into account her combative personality or lack of attraction to him. Tracy is a girl that he uses to try to recapture his youth as he remains immature even though he knows about classic films and enjoys wielding a certain power over his inexperienced girlfriend while also having an \u2018equal' in terms of maturity in many ways. Finally he falls into a romance with the equally tragic Wilkie who has her heart set on various men who she can not commit to because they either overwhelm her or do not provide her with enough of their time. She is shown to throw herself wholeheartedly into a relationship at it's beginning before backing away for fear of being hurt as all of the rejection she has experienced in previous relationships is recalled. He is not satisfied in his relationships with any of these women and is in a perpetual state of discontent as he wants what the other women can provide when he is with one of his love interests.\n\nWhy is it then that this sad little story of a weak man who does not understand his desires or needs makes New York City look so glorious? Mixed in amongst the depressing story and troubled characters are scenes in which characters visit the landmarks of the city which are seen in glorious black and white and set to a score full of classic songs. The opening and closing montages featuring shots of New York City feel exactly like what one imagines when they think of a stereotypical Woody Allen film and for good reason because few directors have the knowledge of the city that he does. There is one spectacular scene in which Allen and Keaton wander through a museum exhibit set in the solar system and without seeing their faces we understand exactly how each of them feels as they consider starting a relationship before he hesitates. Where the films of other New York directors focus on gangsters or plain middle class families Allen aims for insecure upper class Manhattanites who concern themselves with The Grand Illusion (1937) and Kierkegaard. It is too easy to be taken in by these people as they seem to know everything about culture and speak with authority but underneath all of this Allen tells us that even those living in the greatest city on earth can feel hurt, rejection and even love.",

But what his character does in a film I\u2019m perfectly willing to judge. I struggled early with Manhattan because statutory rape just isn\u2019t something I\u2019m capable of chuckling about. This movie asks me to see it as no big deal and a genuine relationship I\u2019m supposed to enjoy. Not only was the main character actively involved in this inappropriate relationship, everyone around him reacts to it with casual acceptance. When I tried to compartmentalize this one aspect of the film, I still didn\u2019t find myself laughing much. The humor is mostly built around Woody Allen\u2019s neurotic personality, and his struggle in romantic relationships. I liked the cast, and the actors do have good comedic timing, but few of the jokes resonated with me enough to get me laughing . I was annoyed by the fact that the characters were pretty despicable, and everyone made the worst decisions. As a result, I didn\u2019t like anybody in Manhattan at all. Plus Woody Allen made the pretentious decision to film it all in black-and-white for no discernible reason. Manhattan is basically all the things I dislike about other Woody Allen movies all rolled into one. I\u2019ve seen worse comedies, but Manhattan did little to interest me. ",

When I'm at my lowest, multiple Woody Allen movies have reminded me that life is still worthwhile, and I'm glad this was one of those. I needed it. It's weird when someone speaks to your soul and you know you'll never get the opportunity to thank them.",

Allen's use of black and white filming and Rhapsody in Blue in the beginning underscores the idea of people over romanticizing the city, and also explains the unanimous love for New York City. However, just like in his relationship with Tracy (Mariel Hemingway) Allen wants to break away, and move on. A beautiful parallel. Allen also accurately portrays the personality of many New Yorkers.\n\n\"Well, I don't get angry, okay? I mean, I have a tendency to internalize. I can't express anger. That's one of the problems I have. I-I grow a tumor instead.\"\n- Woody Allen\n\nAs somebody with a father who grew up in New York City, this line couldn't be more accurate. Truly the New Yorker way.\n\nAllen makes few mistakes in this film -- it was very deftly done. Definitely one of my top films of all time.",

Who cares?  Why do people enjoy these movies?  It didn't teach me anything, none of the character's behavior seemed admirable  or interesting.  \n\nThis movie reminds me of weak and asinine people, and doesn't do George Gershwin's music any justice.

Allen plays another New York writer who gets involved with a complicated woman, this time it's after she ends her affair with his best friend. The plot is standard, but this is still a top 10 classic in the Woody cannon.\nAllen & Keaton both do an excellent job, as do Meryl Streep & Mariel Hemingway (who earned an Oscar nod), but all that is distracted by the one major flaw of this otherwise great film. Playing a 42 year old writer dating a 17 year old girl. At the time I'm sure it was odd at the time, but with all the rumors & allegations we have now about his private life, it's kind of unsettling to watch. He calls it out immediately at the beginning of the movie to normalize it but I doubt most people will ever be comfortable with his May/December choice. Of course, he leaves her for a woman that challenges him intellectually but Freud could have a field day with this. I find the ending to be completely false and unrewarding. Considering that this is Allen's least favorite of his own work I'm sure he agrees. \nThis was my favorite Allen movie in college with it's lush city imagery set to the tunes of Gershwin.

            "content": "Being one of Woody Allen's most critically acclaimed pieces, Manhattan sounded like an intelligent film.\n\n\nFrom a stylish perspective, Manhattan presents a large step out for Woody Allen's tradition of filmmaking. It does not incorporate the same visual or story style to his trademark comic pieces as the film is more comedy-drama yet maintains the same form of atmosphere he establishes in a lot of his films. And in terms of visual style, the cinematography in the film is a lot more atmospheric as it takes on a wider range of angles and incurs more movement and editing than the standard piece. It establishes a feeling of isolation in the atmosphere for viewers and gives them a sense of peeking in on the underside of people's lives. This gives Manhattan a new level of complex depth to it and stronger meaning, and it allows the drama of the film to flourish. And the black and white style of the film gives it an interesting sense of nostalgia. It evokes memories to a much simpler time of cinema, and considering that Manhattan is a rather simple and easy film to watch. The black and white colour palette of the film and lighting evoke a truly classical feel, and that is a great thematic for a Woody Allen film because it makes it all the more meaningful coming from him, as if it is a stylish homage to the films he grew up with. The classical style of the musical score helps to add to this, so Manhattan really is an interesting experience.\nManhattan has the naturally lighthearted feel to it which makes it an easy viewing pleasure. It is not one of Woody Allen's funnier films, but the quality of the comedy in it is fine and it blends with the drama really well. Admittedly it is a rather familiar film in terms of subject matter, but it is still a touching sentiment which is crafter really well with a strong screenplay. The complicated exploration of relationships in Manhattan are an all new angle of exploration for Woody Allen. He has a natural knack for it, and in Manhattan he incorporates it with a new style of filmmaking. It is a very ambitious film, and while it is familiar and relatively slow in pace as well as so realistic in narrative that its drama can only hit a certain level of strength, it is an enjoyable experience. It is a gentle film with a lot of touching plot dynamics to it, although I feel that there is certain predictability to it. It is different to the predictability of a lot of his films as they tend to follow a formula. The thing about Manhattan is that the ending of the film is inevitable, and is somewhat of a letdown. Considering that it is another film about the relationship between characters played by Woody Allen and Diane Keaton, it has an ending to similar to Annie Hall from the preceding year. Both films are good, although Manhattan fails to reach the heights of Annie Hall. It is more stylish, but the fact that the ending is so similar makes it slightly disappointing. Considering the unpredictable nature of the film it would be hard to pick a perfect ending, but I guess I just felt that the one in Manhattan was a letdown which was a bit too similar to Annie Hall. But still, a lot of the other elements that Manhattan borrows from Annie Hall are good.\nAnd thanks to a fine cast, Manhattan remains a solid film on a human level.\nWoody Allen plays out a character less like his stereotypical nebbish than in many of his other films. This time he tones down to Jewish shtick and focuses more on a character who seems naturally like him. His performance is realistic and easily likable which makes the frequently cartoonish character a more humane one. This makes the sympathy in the film a lot stronger as the protagonist is one that audiences will more likely care about. Woody Allen's subtle comic approach to the material and legitimate dramatic work is just grand in Manhattan which makes it one of his greatest leading performances, and his chemistry with every other actor, particularly Diane Keaton, is just wonderful. I was thoroughly impressed with his leading performance in Manhattan as it is very far from indulgent.\nDiane Keaton does a fine job in Manhattan as well. She conveys a great sense of confusion and unpredictability in the role which makes her an intriguing character. Her emotional confusion contributes a great part to the film's exploration of complicated love in relationships, and she pulls it off really easily. Her role is ripe with charisma and finely dramatic without ever descending to melodrama or any sort of cheap comic ploy. She steps away from her iconic Annie Hall role to deliver another excellent performance in a Woody Allen film, so her presence as the leading actress is very welcome.\nMariel Hemingway proves to make herself a likable foil in Manhattan as well. She has a youthful spirit to her and her chemistry with Woody Allen is just great. She is sweet, and in her young age she is easily able to work the best out of Woody Allen's script which is impressive as it is such complex stuff. She makes a name for herself very well in Manhattan, and despite a small period of screen time she is easily memorable.\nMeryl Streep also delivers an early performance in Manhattan where viewers get to see her talents from the same year when she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in Kramer vs. Kramer. Her brief appearance contributes some grand moments to the film, so she is really genial.\n\nSo Manhattan is a rather slow film with a somewhat unsatisfactory  ending and a sense of familiar themes, but it is powerfully stylish, touching and extremely well-acted which makes use of all of Woody Allen's greatest talents.",

After giving it a second look, I now see that I perceived it to be Allen's declaration of his own self-absolution, an embracing of his deeply flawed nature (the 17 year-old love interest specifically), when in actuality it proves to be less of Allen forgiving himself of his sins and more of his own self-flagellation. The perfect rendering of New York, the sentimental and nostalgic social-construct of an idea of New York, is intoxicating and emotionally mirrors his sense of self, the two irreparably fused and co-dependent at the same time. With a bittersweet tone, wealth of critical insight, and impeccable production, \"Manhattan\" is a masterpiece, and rivals only the great \"Annie Hall\" for the title of Allen's most perfect work.",

As for the movie itself, it just seemed like your typical Woody Allen movie, which are usually about relationships between friends and lovers. For 1979, this must have been a unique movie because of its mixture between comedy and serious relationship issues, which we all can relate to, but for this day and age, we have seen this type of film many times before. The relationship between Woody and the young girl was interesting, along with the ex-wife, played by Meryl Streep, whose become a lesbian after having a child with Woody, so there's enough material to keep the movie watchable. Personally, it does go down as some of his best work because he got everything right, but I'm still struggling to get his humour. Watchable!\n\nRound-Up:\nAfter watching some of Woody Allen's later work, I can see why everyone rated his earlier on projects because he had a unique style of directing/writing which is very dry and offensive but in a joking type of way. Half of his jokes in his earlier movies, wouldn't be politically correct for modern times, which is why it's easier to stick with Romantic Comedies. Anyway, Mariel Hemingway put it a emotional and realistic performance, at such a young age, and the rest of the cast made the movie believable interesting.\n\nBudget: $9million\nWorldwide Gross: $40million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there Woody Allen movies about finding love and relationships with close friends. 6/10",

I did feel like it was a good tribute to the city-showcasing all the arts, theatre, architecture, and activity manhattan has to offer. that's mostly all I liked of it other than some occasionally inciteful or funny dialogue.

What truly clicked within me are the few subtle moments filled with Isaac's mumbling and his looking away. Allen said \"he has no problem in meeting women\", yet with some careful thought, we realized he has no problem drawing women's attention, but failed at maintaining them. As in \"Chapter 1\", New York meant beautiful women and street smart guys who know all the angles. Isaac is witty, but not in the same way as the street smart guys. The women Isaac met are all beautiful, yet they're not particularly after Isaac's gifts. With an identity crisis, Isaac holds too strong of an ideal that's most likely developed from unsuccessful attempts with women and life. An intangible ideal is perfect for escaping reality and putting oneself at a higher ground above anything else. Yet Isaac is just an ordinary guy, with a witty sense of humor, chasing after delicately decorated faces, shaped by modern advertising, only with a romantic touch of his own interpretations. Allen Woody was absolutely incredible at interpreting the character that has struck my emotions so hard with the subtle, delicate moments.",

Woody is in love with two women, Diane Keaton and 17 year old Mariel Hemingway. There's two. Then there is Michael Murphy and Diane Keaton, the former being married and Woody's best friend. That's three. The 4th and final is the real Woody Allen's love affair with New York. This is by far the most interesting of all the love stories in this flick. The way the film is shot and written and by using Gershwin tunes as the final brush stroke, Woody paints a picture of his New York. It is very easily, a New York anyone can see themselves living in. While it's not my favorite and I tend to the story is basically the same one he always tells, I've learned to enjoy this film more over the years.

It's not that I have anything against beautiful women choosing the scrawny bookworm type, in fact, I welcome it.  It's just, I keep hearing time and again from people who make movies that you can't strain the suspension of disbelief by this wide a margin.  In fact, they've told me that there's no way anyone will buy a romance between a geeky looking guy and the hot supermodel.  Are my film professors just a bunch of jerks who've had their minds twisted by a Hollywood mode of thinking, or is it the sad truth?  Personally, I like to think that any good man fits well with any good woman regardless of what they look like, but, according to film school, most audiences just won't buy it.  On the subject of Woody Allen's Manhattan, I think it's a winner, and I found myself easily charmed by it regardless of the seeming mismatch between the romantic leads.",

Thanks to the lensing of Gordon Willis and the great writing and directing of Mr. Allen, we see New York like a grand cityscape filled with impossibly weird and complex people, and a painterly landscape that moves and breathes.\n\nThis is also a celebration of unrequited love, missed connections, and ambiguity. For all his musings on how pointless life ultimately is to him, Allen is a man who keeps coming back to \"fate\" or purpose, and that's all over this film.",

Woody's character was funny and very crazy, always giving his view on everything and basically turning everything into a joke. He got annoying at times but that's what made his character so great. It's a great story that throws so much in with romance, comedy and even drama. I never really knew much of Woody Allen, all I recognized his voice from was that movie Antz (which looking back isn't that great and had horrible voice acting).

It's a well conceived film, to be sure, with amazing cinematography, a unique story, and a script penned by Woody that is filled with his characteristic wit and dialogue, with good characterizations and an avoidance of clich\u00e9s. \n\nSet against a beautiful backdrop of late 1970s New York, and filmed in black and white, it looks brilliant. The acting is as strong as most Allen pieces, with solid early performances from greats Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep. All of this contribute to what feels like a very real story. This is what Allen is perhaps best at, injecting humor and comedy into realistic situations.\n\nMy issue with Manhattan, however, is that the story isn't as involving or as engaging as his other works. It's also not nearly as funny. This is perhaps at least partly due to the dated nature of the film, not aging as well in humor as even some of his earlier works, such as the fantastic Annie Hall. It's enjoyable, but it never reaches the pinnacle of Allen's other work which are often more poignant, hilarious, and engaging.\n\n3.5/5 Stars",

Among the standouts of American cinema in the post-studio era. Virtually perfect. The film's lifted to extraordinary heights by, among other things, a brilliant screenplay, careful direction, spectacular cinematography, and amazing performances from (particularly) Allen, Keaton, and Hemingway. There's more beneath the (glittering) surface of \"Manhattan\" than any Allen film. At the center of it all is a captivating tension between romantic ideals -- the drive to satisfy them, and the hypocritical demand that others do the same -- and something of far less starry-eyed allure -- reality. This tension is achieved in multiple, varied ways within the film. From the disconnect between the impeccable look of the film and the messes played out by the characters on screen, to the contrast between one character's surprisingly precocious authenticity and the world of disingenuous posturing that infects the remaining characters. The question at the end of \"Manhattan,\" when revelation may find reality triumphing over romanticism, and taking on a more enduring, humane, and compassionate value of its own, is whether enlightenment (if that's what is) has come too late.",

However, theManhattan is a film that definitely stands the test of time. With great cinematography, great writing, and terrific performances from Diane Keaton and Mariel Hemingway, Manhattan is already ahead of most films of this kind. However, the reason that I did not love it to the level I expected that I would be due to a few things. For one, Woody Allen's character is whiny to the point of pure annoyance in this one. I do not remember him being this damn whiny in Annie Hall, which turned me off immediately. Second, it was neither as funny or as romantic as one would expect from a film of this kind. It was romantic and funny at times, but never to the level that it should have been. Finally, the plot is so damn creepy. A 42 year old man dating a 17 year old girl? Jesus, Woody Allen let's be a little more subtle please. Regardless, as I said, the writing, imagery, and acting, are all impeccable, which really alleviate most of my concerns, and the direction from Woody Allen is very good as well as it perfectly paced and told very well. Overall, Manhattan is a very good film that does not feel as though it came out in 1979.",

His way with words is uncanny, his confidence in crafting characters that reek of charisma, in providing a raw and visceral study on the city and the people within. 'Manhattan' is just one stellar example of this, and whilst the film does trail off here and there into a depth of boredom, the witty and charismatic study present makes for a fantastic viewing experience.\"Chapter One. He was as tough and romantic as the city he loved. Behind his black- rimmed glasses was the coiled sexual power of a jungle cat.\" Opening to this enthralling monologue from the hands of Allen, we are instantly cast into a world that implements a raw and detailed look into a New York of yesteryear. Allen provides us with an intricate character study that addresses subjects like adultery, drug addiction and sexual prowess, whilst examining the effects on each individual and the city around them.Each acting body present gives their utmost best in regards to performances with Allen and Keaton leading the way, each captured stunningly by utterly gorgeous black and white cinematography that captures the hustle and bustle of the city in elaborate detail. Whilst the film does thin towards the middle, the confident screenplay and witty humour make up for the minor flaws that exist, thus giving us one of the most self-assured films in cinema.",
