            "review_title": "One of Cotten's triumphs; Hitchcock's film is not unconventional, but unabashedly gripping",
            "content": "One thing that strikes many who come upon Shadow of a Doubt, one of this filmmaker's triumphs, is the knowledge that it was Hitchcock's favorite among his own films- and many watch it with very high expectations, getting shot down as well, making it one of his more under-rated efforts. True, it doesn't go for the immense macabre that lay in Psycho, The Birds, and Frenzy, but it is very effective in telling its stories, and giving us character to either love, or love to hate.The whole concept to the story is very appealing- a (painfully) normal suburban family gets a calling from a relative- Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten)- who wants to come by for a little while. The oldest daughter, also named Charlie (Teresa Wright), almost feels like a kindred spirit to her uncle, happy as can be that he's come to visit. Things start to unravel, however, when two detectives on his trail come into town, bringing to young Charlie to light what could be going down, or what might not be, or what is as clear as psychopathic day.It's actually of interest to compare this film to Psycho, I think, in how it's so akin to to how Hitchcock tells the story of the ordinary people of the world getting involved with a certifiable gentlemen. And, perhaps, one could argue (I might, up to a point) that Cotten's performance rivals that of a Perkins' Norman Bates leading male in the sense of subtleties of the suspense in the film. He seems so... calm so much in the film, and even when he shows his hand as to who he really is, there's a lot of depth to his personality. We may hate him, but he is an understandable, frighteningly recognizable monster. And it solidifies in my book that Cotten had a wonderful range in his work, when he could go from playing a Jed Leland in Citizen Kane to this film, and then on to The Third Man's Holly Martins. Here, he digs into the character and you'll either find it unconvincing in the 40's sense, or a knock-out. As for Teresa Wright, she finds some good notes as well in playing off of Cotten, even in the earlier scenes. And those kids are just the right icing to the cake the film cooks up.It may take a couple of viewings to really warm up to this film, or you may like it right away. But Shadow of a Doubt contains not only fine acting, but also some trademark Hitchcock camera stylizing. My favorites included a particular shot closing in from medium close-up to extreme close-up on Uncle Charlie when he's in a memorable monologue at the dinner table. Another is the use of the dark value on the characters when they talk outside. And, of course, a climax that is genuine in theatricality. A+",

            "content": "It is well known that this film is Alfred Hitchcock's favourite of his own oeuvre, and it's a big favourite of mine also. It is also well documented that for this film, Hitchcock stated that he \"wants to bring violence back into the home, where it belongs\" and he has certainly succeeded at doing that. Hitchcock spends much of the early screen time building up the family at the centre of the tale, and then allowing the violence to come to them, which shows Hitchcock's mastery of the medium as showing the story develop in this way makes the tale much more frightening than if we hadn't got to know the family at the centre of the story first. Joseph Cotten stars as uncle Charlie; a man fleeing Philadelphia to escape the law after marrying and then murdering several rich widows. He goes to stay with his sister and her family, which includes a husband, two young children and the eldest daughter; his niece and namesake; also called 'Charlie'.Hitchcock puts the focus of the story on young Charlie and her relationship with her uncle. This gives the story a frightening angle as it follows the classic tale of the strange uncle. It's also well done as young Charlie is shown to be the sweetest of characters, and when the dark uncle Charlie enters the fray, her sweet world is infected by nightmares, which also gives way to elements of the classic 'coming of age' tale to enter the proceedings. As if that wasn't enough, Shadow of a Doubt also exposes the trust we put in our loved ones, and how any person is likely to try and shift the blame, or ignore it completely, if their loved one has done wrong. This is shown by the way that young Charlie still attempts to cover for her beloved uncle even when all the evidence is pointing to him being guilty. Hitchcock has turned this thriller, which could easily have been routine, into a complex study of a family that retains it's interest throughout due to the multiple themes on display.Joseph Cotten was the absolute perfect choice to play uncle Charlie. His portrayal is picture perfect; he carries with him an atmosphere of dread and morbidity throughout, even when he's not doing anything wrong. A role of this sort is difficult to get right, as it's all to easy to underplay it so it isn't effective, or to overstate it so it becomes ridiculous; but Cotten gets the performance spot on. Teresa Wright, who stars alongside Cotten in the role of the other Charlie also does well and delivers a mature and assured performance that fits her character brilliantly. Some of the supporting roles look a little suspect at times, but on the whole the acting from the support is good enough.The ending of the film comes somewhat against the run of play and is maybe a little bit too over the top after the rest of the film, which is largely down to earth. However, it does work and a big ending isn't something I am in the habit of complaining about. This is up there with Hitchcock's best work and therefore is highly recommended.",

            "review_title": "\"Average families are the best\"",
            "content": "Alfred Hitchcock's style as a director was a bit like a train \u0096 it ran perfectly well, but only along its own lines. He wasn't comfortable adapting his style to suit the material, but when the material suited his style he could do incredible things.Three years and five pictures into his Hollywood career, Hitch had been having some trouble finding projects he was comfortable with. He had made a couple of adventure thrillers in the vein of his late 30s British films, but the old magic wasn't there. Finally, with Shadow of a Doubt he came upon a project that was right up his street. It represents a welcome return to the domestic murder dramas that had given him his earliest successes (The Lodger, Blackmail), with a storyline ideal for Hitchcock. It is the purest example of murder in a \"normal\" setting, bringing the audience uncomfortably close to the killer, helped along with plenty of the grisly gallows humour that the Master loved.Hitch's British pictures had great charm and character, but they were often technically a little haphazard. By now though he knows exactly how to use the camera to manipulate the audience. He begins by carrying us into the story, sweeping in over the city through scenery both pretty and ugly, to home in on an average looking neighbourhood. From then on, every shot, move and edit is calculated to keep up the suspense and unfold the plot. Whereas those early films were swamped and sometimes spoiled by showy camera tricks, Hitch now uses those techniques sparingly, like playing a trump card. For example, he has Joseph Cotton look directly into the camera for a brief moment as he snatches the newspaper back from Theresa Wright. Another trick is to have the camera dolly back as a character advances, only at a faster speed than the actor is moving, which gives a very dizzying effect.Special mention should also be made of Dimitri Tiomkin's score. Tiomkin was the best composer Hitch worked with before Bernard Hermann, and one of the few who really understood how a Hitchcock film needs to be scored. His sparse string arrangements really capture that sense of spiralling terror without overpowering the scene and turning it into melodrama. He interpolates Franz Lehar's Merry Widow waltz at just the right level, making it noticeable but never overstated\u0096 throwing in just a bar or two at an opportune moment, sometimes disguising it in a minor key.We also have a great cast lined up here. This is among Joseph Cotton's finest performances, which is unusual because Hitch was not a brilliant director of actors. I believe the reason is that, although his soft, honest features meant he usually played clean-cut good guys (as well as making him the perfect choice for the friendly uncle no-one would suspect), he was actually at his best when playing villains. That air of affected friendliness, which gives way to a deadpan monotone, is ironically far more convincing than when he attempted to play genuine niceness. Theresa Wright also does a brilliant job of handling her character's transition from childlike innocence to knowing cynicism. The icing on the cake is a couple of spot-on comic relief supporting parts from Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn.It's quite appropriate that in his cameo for Shadow of a Doubt, Hitchcock is shown holding all the cards, because here he really did have all the elements working in his favour. It marks the beginning of his golden age and lays down the blueprint for such classics as Rear Window, Vertigo and Psycho. This is about as close to perfect as Hitchcock's pictures get.",

            "content": "\"Shadow of a Doubt\" may only be listed as #181 on IMDb's \"Top 250\" list, but in my opinion it far outweighs some of the films higher up on that list and is one of Hitch's very best films.Joseph Cotten plays Charlie, a crook on the run from the police. Left stranded and pursued, he decides to move in with his brother's family. His niece - who loves him and sees him as a sort of perfect role model - at first is excited that her Uncle Charlie is coming...but then things start to get strange. Charlie acts oddly and, at times, violent. She begins to become suspicious of her uncle as he becomes more suspicious of her own awareness.The ending of \"Shadow of a Doubt\" is classic Hitchcock and some of the best stuff he's done. The entire film is taut and suspenseful, well-filmed and realistic. It manages to focus on family ties and the struggles within the family itself while it also juggles the whole theme of an outcast family member.In the end, however, it's just a nail-biting thriller that - now over sixty years old - still reigns as one of the absolute best of its genre.",

            "review_title": "Brilliance From Hitchcock & Cotten",
            "content": "\"Shadow of a Doubt\" is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most brilliant and most carefully-constructed films, and is further notable as one of the very finest performances of Joseph Cotten, in his role as \"Uncle Charlie\".  Both the movie and the central character are thought-provoking and rich in detail.The film has an intriguing form that Hitchcock used a number of times (for example, in \"Strangers on a Train\" and \"Frenzy\"), that of setting up carefully constructed contrasts between two main characters, contrasts that in turn reflect a further complex of themes in the movie's broader setting and story.  Here, the central contrast comes from the relationship between Uncle Charlie and his niece \"young Charlie\" (Teresa Wright).  Their unusually close relationship creates tension and intrigue that go beyond the basic concern of the main story-line (which is, namely, whether Uncle Charlie is the elusive serial killer sought by the police).  The uncle-niece relationship also mirrors a great many other topics explored by the film: most obviously the contrast between the small-town atmosphere of Santa Rosa, where Uncle Charlie has come to hide out with his sister's family, but also the complicated nature of the other relationships that we see.  A fine supporting cast led by Henry Travers, Patricia Collinge, and Hume Cronyn help us focus in on hidden aspects of small-town family and neighborhood life.\"Shadow of a Doubt\" is less known and celebrated than Hitchcock's 50's and early 60's work, and even than some of his 30's British films, most probably because it does not contain any of the director's famous set pieces, which were already a part of his pictures well before \"Shadow of a Doubt\" was made.  After all, it is a movie about a suspected serial killer, and not only do we never see him kill anyone, he never even tries anything violent until much later in the film.  But what \"Shadow of a Doubt\" lacks in the spectacular it makes up in tension and characterization, especially in Cotten's brilliant performance.  He is by turns charming, calculating, suspicious, and menacing, a balance very difficult to maintain with credibility for an entire film.  Cotten's skill and Hitchcock's direction make Uncle Charlie one of Hitchcock's most memorable characters.Though more slow-paced than most of the famous director's works, this is still one of his greatest, and should be very satisfying to any fan of Hitchcock, of Cotten, or of noirish/crime thrillers.",

We switch from the tight, small lodging out into wide open and view a chase on foot from above, runners and shadows racing before us as we wonder just what is afoot. As it happens we are to find out that Joseph Cotton's character is guilty almost straight away yet spend the rest of the film in suspense as we doubt ourselves. This partly because of the tale of his personal history and partly because of the love and affection of his niece, a wonderful performance from Teresa Wright. Shot largely on location and using a lovely old property in which the large family tumble this way and that in marvellous abandon while the lady of the house tries to maintain control. I learn from the extras that in the end, more shots were required by Hitch and so a set had to be built anyway replicating the building. A very fine, involving, moving and suspenseful film.",

The arrival of everyone's much loved Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton, in his favorite role) is the catalyst to disaster, with eldest daughter Charlie in particular welcoming the arrival of her affectionate namesake as a relief from the humdrum routine of suburban life. But evidence soon begins to suggest the elder Charles might actually be a cold-blooded serial killer, and a lethal game of charades begins between uncle and niece: she knows the truth, and he knows that she knows the truth. The tension builds to an alarming climax, in a trademark sequence (another one for the Hitchcock highlight reel) showing the Master of Suspense at the top of his form.

            "content": "Shadow of a Doubt is classified as a Film Noir thriller. While I can see elements of film noir and elements of the thriller genre in this film, I think this film is more of a character study. It's a story about what happens when a soul-mate turns out to be somebody unexpected.The cast is excellent, and the lead characters - played by Joseph Cotten and Teresa Wright - are very well imagined, written and portrayed. Both characters called for sweeping and dramatic personality changes which Wright and Cotten pulled off convincingly. Wright plays a very young woman (19-ish) living with her family and sort of depressed and aimless, while Cotten is her namesake and favorite uncle, Charlie. Uncle Charlie has come to visit and brought good cheer to the entire family, but shortly after his arrival, young Charlie begins to discover that Uncle Charlie has some sinister secrets. As the clues begin to add up to a coherent conclusion, Wright's character is forced to decide what to do about her growing, troublesome, understanding.In typical Hitchcockian fashion, the film toys with its audience for the first 3/4ths and does not reveal itself until its almost too late - playing on paranoia, misleading and ambiguous dialog, and terrific acting to create equivocation. However, as you will see, this is not the standard Hitchcock stuff - in the end it has more to do with the characters and what they do than the action and resolution of the ingenious plot.The Hitch' blows me away almost every time, and Shadow of a Doubt is one of his best. If you haven't seen it, you should. It's a very thoughtful and exquisitely executed character study about a very young and very bright woman, encountering the heavy side of life for the first time, and the choices she makes. Worth seeing for Wright's performance alone (easily Oscar-worthy), Shadow of a Doubt is a timeless piece of noir-esquire originality.",

            "content": "I don't believe Shadow of a Doubt will rank as one of Alfred Hitchcock's best film. But second rank Hitchcock is better than most people's best efforts. Joseph Cotten has come for a visit to Santa Rosa, California to see his sister Patricia Collinge and her family. They welcome him as the prodigal brother. But his very perceptive niece named after him played by Teresa Wright suspects something is wrong with this picture.Uncle Charlie is suspected of being a serial killer with the monniker of The Merry Widow Killer. He strangles rich old widows and robs them. I guess it's a living, albeit one with risks.Those risks are getting to him and on some levels you see Cotten almost wants to be caught. In fact Teresa starts to suspect him over a trivial incident involving her dad's paper. Cotten goes to great lengths to hide a feature story about The Merry Widow Murders. When she goes to the library to see what was in the paper that he didn't want the family to see, this is when she starts figuring it out.Really all Cotten had to do is nothing. But he really did want it to end. I'm not sure any player ever had such an auspicious beginning in such top rated films as Teresa Wright. In the space of three years she appeared in The Little Foxes, Mrs. Miniver, Pride of the Yankees and now Shadow of a Doubt. She's a Nancy Drew if Nancy had ever discovered there was a criminal who was a close relative.Patricia Collinge essentially repeats her role from The Little Foxes. If she's not quite as daft as Miss Birdie, she's still kind of operating within her own world. Henry Travers does fine as her husband as does Hume Cronyn as his partner in their own make believe world of crime.Of course giving a big assist to Ms. Wright's suspicions is the presence of detectives MacDonald Carey and Wallace Ford. They are a team chasing Cotten as one of two men they think is the Merry Widow Killer.One thing with this film is that unlike Suspicion, Hitchcock stood firm and did not bow to pressure to exonerate Cotten like he did with Cary Grant in the previous film. Of course Cotten was fairly new to the cinema so he could be cast as a villain. And Hitchcock does what he does best, toy with the audiences emotions. Like Suspicion when a whole lot of things happen to Teresa Wright they can be explained away and there is that red herring of that other suspect across the continent.Of course the other part of Shadow of a Doubt is how the thing is resolved in regard to Cotten's family. The ending might be a bit too pat, but still it does tie up the loose ends in the best way for all concerned.",

            "content": "It's been reported that the primary appeal of doing \"Shadow of a Doubt\" for Alfred Hitchcock was the idea of bringing a sense of menace to a small, every day American town. In that, this movie brilliantly succeeds. It doesn't join \"Rear Window\" or \"Psycho\" as one of my favorite Hitchcock films, but it has much to recommend it.Joseph Cotten didn't get many chances to play a sinister villain, but he's very good at it. His natural ease and charm work to his advantage in creating a smarmy character who you're never completely sure about. He has a lot of chemistry with Teresa Wright, who plays his niece and supposedly has a closer than normal connection with him. In fact, in typical Hitchcock fashion, their relationship in the early scenes of this film takes on a sort of creepy romantic quality that's never overtly addressed but is always there as subtext.As Wright begins to suspect that her Uncle Charlie might not be such a great guy after all--and may in fact be much worse than simply not a great guy--the balance of power shifts and she begins to play against him. One of the things I liked most about this movie was how strong a character Wright's Charlie is allowed to be. She's not a ninny, like a character in her situation would be in any number of other films. She doesn't swoon, cry and squeal helplessly. After Uncle Charlie tries to kill her by locking her in a garage with a running car, and she comes to looking directly into his face, she doesn't bite her knuckles as you might expect, but rather says with a cold hard determination, \"Go away.\" It's very effective, and the whole movie is like that.It has a great supporting cast, both well cast and acted. There's not a throwaway character among the bunch, and everyone makes much of varying sized roles. Patricia Collinge is a stand out as Uncle Charlie's sister, whose radar is going off even as she doesn't want to believe anything sinister can be happening. Henry Travers is the father of the family...his attitudes toward Charlie change after he comes to the bank where he works and makes inappropriate jokes. It wasn't until the end credits that I even realized who Hume Cronyn was playing; I've never seen him so young.\"Shadow of a Doubt\" isn't as obviously distinguished visually as other Hitchcock films, but it bears his unmistakable mark nonetheless. There aren't as many shots you come away from the film remembering as there are in, say, \"Rear Window.\" But the whole thing has the feeling of being completely controlled from beginning to end. I really liked the way small-town America was portrayed in this film. It's not full of a bunch of rubes who say things like \"aw shucks\" and do silly things for us to laugh at. Hitchcock is skillful at showing the contrast between the small-town life of young Charlie's family and Uncle Charlie's jaded big-city life of crime. But he doesn't condescend or patronize.If you want to see higher-tier Hitchcock, you could do much worse than this film. It's got an engaging story, wonderful acting and complex characters, and a few scenes that qualify as genuine nail biters. Very good! Grade: A",

Against the everyday small town life of its participants, the story unfolds in a leisurely way--perhaps too slow for today's taste.

Macdonald Carey, Hume Cronyn, Patricia Collinge and Henry Travers are all splendid in supporting roles.

And if I'm not sure that he held the film in higher regards than some later classics, I'm pretty sure though that the film was a sentimental favorite. And the word 'sentimental' is crucial as the underlying theme of \"Shadow of a Doubt\", is \"when idealization meets deception\" and we idealize a big deal in the name of sentimentality.So sentimentality was a prevalent element of Hitch' premiere in America, he wanted the most American-looking location, one you couldn't tell in which state it was. The privilege went to Santa Rosa, a postcard little town of old fashion charm, with an obligatory library, train station, bank, all in one copy. Townspeople know each other by first name, from the priest to the brave overweight traffic cop. The town also neighbored some famous Californian vineyards, which made the shooting all the more interesting for Hitch and all.If the sleepy little town could appeal to any outsider in quest of peace, some insiders would have a much different opinion. Charlotte, played by the sweet and talented Teresa Wright, nicknamed Charlie after her mother's brother but will be called Charlotte in this review for clarity's sake, doesn't feel exactly like a fish in water. When we first see her, she's lying on her bed, wondering how she can get off this unbearable heaviness of boredom. And she can't find any supports from her parents played by former co-stars, from \"Mrs. Miniver\", Henry Travers, a banker, and from \"The Little Foxes\", Patricia Collinge as the devoted housewife.All these faces fit together and the actors are so natural we really believe this is a family, but there are many hints suggesting that each member tries to escape from a suffocating routine The mother is mentally rooted in the past and mourns her brother, Charlie whose absence had a profound effect on her well-being. The father shares a strange hobby with his friend Herb (Hume Cronyn in his debut) imagining the perfect crime as if they were about to write a crime novel. The precocious little sister Ann, is a bookworm, as indicated by her glasses, and doesn't indulge to child's activities, and the youngest child Roger enjoys counting steps between places. Unrealistic? I used to do the same thing as a child.As usual, Hitch manages to create eccentric yet realistic characters, and Charlotte, the one person who had her feet on the ground decides to invite her Uncle. She learns that Uncle Charlie is coming to pay a visit after many years of absence. And it's not much the news that delights Charlotte, but the fact that she and her uncle had the same idea, she calls it telepathy, we call it idealization. We all feel a deep connection with the people we love and will find signs everywhere. And sneaky Hitch provides us the same signs, so we can also feel that bond. Narrative-wise, it's excellent because in a film where the bad guy is the main protagonist, Hitch knows we have to root for him a little, he manages to create the empathy by giving similar feelings to the good characters.So Hitchcock (who's all about signs) give us the ultimate sign of a deep bond between Charlie and Charlotte. When we first see Uncle Charlie, played by the great Joseph Cotton, he's also lying in a bed in some lousy place in New Jersey, just like his niece. But obviously, he has darker motives as suggested by the cops who try to arrest him. Uncle Charlie is a fugitive, a criminal whose record will be revealed progressively, but we're already ahead of Charlotte and her family. And the first visual sings of the titular shadow seem to be conveyed by the heavy cloud of gray smokes coming from the train, when Uncle Charlie arrives. Hitchcock, loved contrasts and the idea of sleazy evil coming to disturb the quiet peaceful town, something so impossible that no one would accept it, not even Charlotte, maybe not even us.It's a strange feeling because as soon as he comes, Uncle Charlie is like the touchstone of the family, such a natural charismatic character that we somewhat want the happiness to be maintained to this status quo. However, Uncle Charlie constantly throws hints to the face of Charlotte, and her resistance to face the truth takes its source from her admiration toward uncle. Before being a psychological battle, it's an internal one, and the whole first act is your typical Hitchcockian quest of a mysterious identity. The film gets actually more interesting once Charlotte knows, and has to digest the contrast between her idealization of her Uncle and what he really is, and it's such a startling contrast that she knows her mother mustn't know the secret, because it would kill her, it becomes a life-and-death situation.It also allows to cops not to arrest him in the house and so begins a psychological battle between the man-who-wants-to-stay and the girl-who-wants-him-to-leave and it naturally culminates with murder impulses from both sides. And while the story leads us to its thrilling resolution, we discover deeper and darker aspects of the protagonists' personalities, confronting two visions of life: cheerful and optimistic and twisted and misanthropist, and Teresa Wright is as convincing in the positive as in the negative emotions. And while the good triumphs over the evil, she's slightly contaminated by her Uncle's spirit, and might have her own shadow of a doubt regarding the goodness of human nature.While a masterpiece in its own terms, the film has a few little flaws but Hitch, and even us, viewers, keep on idealizing \"Shadow of a Doubt\", just like the family idealized Uncle Charlie, ignoring his darkest side. It's part of human nature. The question is, do we idealize the film better for its good or for its dark side?",

            "content": "Uncle Charlie did it for me. I mistrusted the uncle thing as a term of endearment ever since. Joseph Cotten is the perfect charming monster. Uncle Charlie's urbanity becomes his most frightening feature. So plausible. So real. Thornton Wilder was Hitchcock's partner in crime this time and it shows. The structure is Our Townish, the characters, deliciously rich. Patricia Collinge's performance is so spot on that you're longing for more. The scenes between Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn are how I imagine the story meetings between Thornton Wilder and Alfred Hitchcock. Teresa Wright's eyes tell the whole story from the audience's point of view, even if the audience is one step ahead of her. Brilliant, because in Joseph Cotten's eyes we find his need for redemption or are we falling in the trap of this master manipulator? We are torn, just like Teresa Wright. I've seen \"Shadow of a Doubt\" 3 or 4 times but every time you're forced to take the trip with the same amount of commitment. I've been toying with the thought of a remake, I've been doing this lately, although I hate the idea of remakes of great movies, this one is one of those that in the right hands could have a real impact. Using Thornton Wilder's original script as the Bible, Steven Sodebergh could do scrumptious remake for the new millennium. Tim Robbins as uncle Charlie, can you imagine? Natalie Portman as his niece. Joan Cusak and William H Macy as her parents. Wouldn't you go to see that?",

Theresa Wright is a gem, and holds her own quite nicely against veteran actor, Joseph Cotton. What you need to look for in this film are the subtle cues given that build until Charlie suspects her beloved uncle is a murderer, and eventually even tries to kill her, not once but several times. Made when the world was at war, I find it especially disturbing to realize that evil could and can be anywhere. Even sitting around your own dining room table.",

This allows Hitch to pull off his famous 'twists' throughout the course of the movie, hitting you every now and then with something you simply weren't expecting.One of my favourite elements in the movie is the ongoing dialogue between Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn, avid mystery readers who are constantly discussing the best ways to murder each other.  Apart from being a bit of comic relief in an otherwise very dark film, it also demonstrates how lightly people think of murder and murderers...until they encounter them face-to-face.My advice then, if you want to see this movie, is not to learn anything about it beforehand.  Going in with no knowledge will increase the movie's initial impact, and will help you to appreciate why Hitchcock was the 'Master of Suspense'.  This is a taut thriller with no gratuitous violence, foul language, or mature situations.(Hitch considered it 'a family film'.)Enjoy!",

Cotton's own personality works magic in bringing out all the nuances of personality in this role.One of the most talented of actors, Teresa Wright, is cast in the lead role. Her enormous talent and thespian integrity are put to the test here, and they triumph in a great performance.  Like Cathy O'Donnell, another sweet, girl-next-door type, Wright's persona ran out early in Hollywood, and she was prematurely pushed into matronly roles.

            "content": "Shadow of a Doubt mayn't be my personal favourite of Hitchcock's movies, but it is in my opinion one of his most suspenseful and tense films evident from right at the beginning with the cloud of ominous black smoke. In short, it is a brilliant classic thriller. Even after first seeing the movie 7 years ago when I was 11, the film never loses its tension. Some people might say it lacks the show-off set pieces that was Hitch's trademark, but I have to say I don't find that the case. I for one found the climax especially nail-biting. On top of that, the film is very well made, the cinematography once again is faultless and the production values are sumptuous. The music also adds to the suspense and the tension, it is beautiful at times with the mix of Lehar's Merry Widow Overture, which is significant to the story, yet in the more tense scenes, it is powerful, haunting and chilling. The script is also of high-calibre quality, as is Hitch's direction. As are the performances. Teresa Wright is pretty much the epitome of pumpkin-pie innocence, while Joseph Cotton is charming and suave yet somewhat chilling as well as the killer who is wanted in the east for relieving widows of their wealth and their lives. The story is swiftly-told, isn't that complicated and moves along at a reasonable pace if rather slow on occasions. Overall, suspenseful, tense and well made, a must see for fans of the Master of Suspense. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The performances are remarkable. Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten are superb. Their on screen interaction is intriguing and brilliantly executed. Patricia Collinge is outstanding as the mother and sister. Hume Cronyn is very funny.I only thought that the portrayal of the two detectives was a little odd. They were quite stupid.

            "content": "\"Shadow of a Doubt\" was reputedly Alfred Hitchcock's favorite of his own films, and I guess that really must mean something since he directed more than three dozen of versatile cinematic classics that are all universally considered as brilliant. With all due respect, however, I don't concur with the Master. Even though \"Shadow is a Doubt\" is an intelligently scripted and highly original thriller, my personal preferences lie with the more visceral horrors that Hitch made, like \"Psycho\", \"Frenzy\" and \"The Birds\". Nevertheless, I like to think it's very significant that Hitchcock names this one as his favorite and, to me, it proves that he also has a predilection for horror and sadism. Rather than choosing for his uptight thrillers (\"Read Window\", \"Vertigo\" ...) or his convoluted conspiracy thrillers (\"North by Northwest\", \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" ...), he prefers the dark little tale of a cold-hearted psychopath arriving in a sleepy small town and turning the lives of his unsuspecting family members upside down. Our visionary director clearly finds tremendous joy in unleashing pure evil, in the shape of charming and wealthy self-made man \"Uncle\" Charlie Oakley, upon the peaceful community of Santa Rosa, California. But even more remarkable is that the na\u00efve and picturesque community, and particularly Charlie's beloved adolescent niece (also named Charlie after her uncle), is subconsciously craving for and warmly welcoming the embodiment of evil! Young Charlie is desperate for some excitement in her mundane life, so imagine the confusion when she slowly realizes that her \"special-bond\" uncle is the notorious Merry Widow Murderer and the subject of a nationwide police manhunt. It's praiseworthy how Alfred Hitchcock delivers a tense and atmospheric thriller in which the fearsome serial killer isn't even seen committing any of the vile crimes he's wanted for! Young Charlie puts the pieces of the mysterious puzzle together herself, with the help of her love-interest police inspector, and meanwhile Uncle Charlie becomes less lovable and more menacing. I've rarely seen a director playing with the emotions of his lead characters so efficiently, while both Theresa Wright and the genius Joseph Cotton make the most out of their unusual roles. The eye of detail in the script and in Hitchcock's direction is fantastic! For example: as a sort of running game, young Charlie's father and a befriended neighbor (Hume Cronyn) are always debating original and vicious methods for murdering each other, even though they are both normal and slightly dull family men. It's further proof of how the whole of Santa Rosa is unwillingly embracing the coming of evil. I'm changing my mind, in fact... \"Shadow of a Doubt\" must be listed in my top five favorite Hitchcock films!",

            "content": "Charlie and Charles are an extremely close niece and uncle who can read each other's minds, even seemingly across the country. Their ESP between each other is dangerous. Charlie (Teresa Wright) was named after her mother's much younger brother (Joseph Cotten), and even though they haven't seen each other in years, they adore each other. But even though they can read each other like a clock, Charlie can't quite figure out at first what secret her newly arrived uncle is hiding from the family. Charles is obviously on the run, because he has escaped from his New Jersey boarding house to his sister's house in the small city of Santa Rosa, California. Once there, Charles mixes right in with the family even though Charlie and her precocious younger sister Anne sense something is up. Anne is hysterically brainy, as evidenced in her first scene, answering the telephone from the telegraph company. \"I'm saving my mind for more important things\", she tells the operator. Charlie's father Henry Travers and neighbor Hume Cronyn spend hours plotting to outdo each other with causes, motives and clues concerning murder, an ironic hobby considering Traver's brother-in-law Cotten. But Charles can't keep his secret for long, and Wright begins to figure out why she has strange premonitions, the plot thickens. A trek to the library (with fabulous character actress Eily Maylon as the librarian) reveals all, and from there, Cotten is ripe to be picked.There is no real mystery, just the exciting revelation of what Cotten's crime is. Like Hitchcock later did in \"Strangers on a Train\", he turns popular music sinister; in this case, it's the \"Merry Widow Waltz\", and it ends up a theme for a total sociopath. \"Shadow of a Doubt\" and \"Strangers on a Train\" (using \"The Strawberry Blonde\") were effective enough to lead Hitchcock create the spooky glass-shattering music played over Janet Leigh's stabbing in \"Psycho\". It is also very ironic that every time Cotten appears that the photography gets darker or in outdoor sequences, dark clouds appear, much like an omen. Like the character of Hannibal Lecter later in \"Silence of the Lambs\" and its follow-up movies, Cotten plays a charming, educated sophisticate who is deadly dangerous. Everybody in the film shines; Wright, at the top of her game after \"Pride of the Yankees\" and \"Mrs. Miniver\", seemed destined for stardom. Her co-star from \"The Little Foxes\" (Patricia Collinge) is wonderfully lovable as the naive mother, while Edna May Wonacott as Anne steals every moment she is in.",

I think this is because on second viewing, I noticed some plot problems that hindered me from scoring it higher. I should point out that IMDb users have placed the film in the top 250, so it's quite possible I am nitpicking, but I just thought the film could have been better--especially from a suspense point of view.Joseph Cotten plays a man who you think is a multiple murderer. Oddly, whether he is or not COULD have been held until the end of the film, but the truth of it was revealed about halfway into the film--and kind of took the wind out of the sails. While the only one who knew that he was a murderer was his niece, Teresa Wright, she kept this to herself--even when it seemed he was trying to kill her!! Now I know that Ms. Wright supposedly didn't want to upset her mother by announcing that he was a murderer, but after two attempts on her life and nothing said by Wright, you just have to assume she's an idiot! In addition, she did a lousy job of hiding it from Cotten--making her an obvious liability. I hate \"suspense\" movies that rely on the basic stupidity of a character in order to keep the film going! However, apart from these serious problems, the film STILL is pretty exciting--and the ending is very, very memorable. However I still think the film is a bit overrated.FYI--For those who love to spot Hitchcock, you see the back of his head and a bit of his side profile towards the beginning of the film on the train.

It doesn't help that Cotten is pretty bad in one of the key roles (even Cotten admitted he was never a good actor). I saw it in a revival theatre years ago and the audience was laughing out loud when Cotten gave his little speech about hating widows so much! He's supposed to come across as evil there but the blank look on his face doesn't convey anything! The rest of the cast is good and Wright is exceptional but they can't do much with the dull dialogue and slow pace.

Nevertheless, the house still stands in Santa Rosa today.This is a tense, successful film concerning Charles, a man who kills rich widows. To escape the police, Charles, known as the Merry Widow Killer, visits his sister and her family in a small town. This is one of Hitchcock's signatures, bringing danger to an unexpected place. His niece, Charlie (Charlotte) feels a special bond with him, which turns out to be dangerous for her as she soon realizes that her uncle isn't the smooth and charming man he pretends to be. Hitchcock believed that villains had to be attractive, not slimy - otherwise, how could they con anyone? So he chose handsome Joseph Cotten, who is excellent in his role. Theresa Wright is wonderful as the young niece, who is about to lose her innocence and learn a hard life lesson. There are several things I love about the film: One - the bizarre murder plots concocted by Henry Travers, who plays Wright's father, and his friend, played by Hume Cronyn. As they discuss abstract killings, there is a murderer in their midst. Another thing, much more subtle, demonstrates Hitchcock's tremendous knowledge of human beings. None of the little children want to sit next to Uncle Charlie. Pure spirits, children always know when someone isn't quite right.MacDonald Carey is one of the investigating detectives who has a lovely scene with Wright at the end of the film.

A kind of precursor to the films of Nicholas Ray, Douglas Sirk and even David Lynch's \"Blue Velvet\", \"Shadow\" then begins to peel back facades and take a look at America's \"actual\" social and moral landscape. Subverting Norman Rockwell idylls, with their white picket fences and picture-perfect All American Families, Hitchcock offers a world in which Bank of America towers loom ominously over small towns, and where almost all characters are dull materialists afflicted with a terrible loneliness.Into this world steps Charlotte, a teenager on the cusp of womanhood, budding breasts and all. She finds herself in her own little rights-of-passage, awakening to her newfound sexuality and also the existential hollowness of those around her. \"Nothing happens,\" she mourns. \"We eat and sleep and that's about it!\" Charlotte's father counters that they have money, but she cuts him off: \"How can you talk about money when I'm talking about souls?\" In Hitchcock's films, the villain oft embodies temptations to which, on an unconscious level, the heroes have yielded or wish to yield. Think the tennis pro in \"Strangers on a Train\" who secretly wishes to rid himself of an inconvenient wife, an act which is actually acted upon by someone else. A similar situation takes place in \"Rear Window\". In this way, a number of Hitch's films function as parables of sin and expiation.And so Charlotte and her namesake Charlie have a creepy relationship. They have a telepathic bond, he puts a wedding ring on her finger and sexual sparks fly whenever they're together. But Charlie then begins to reveal himself to be akin to the killers in Hitchcock's \"Rope\". He views himself as being \"superior\" and above common, bourgeois men. Deeply nostalgic, he also has fantasies about returning to the \"gay ole 1890s\", \"when things were better\". Charlotte sympathises with these views, detests those around her, until Charlie reveals himself to be a monster. Charlotte recoils from this point onwards, as if catching a glimpse of herself in a mirror. We see here the seductively dangerous nature of nostalgia, specifically the reactionary kinship between conservatism (an idealised past) and sentimental liberalism, where, as author Dennis Grunes notes, \"the latter replaces the historical past with childhood as the object of adoration, converting it, too, into a pathological fetish.\" Charlie and Charlotte themselves function as shadows who have doubts. He views himself as the ideal male (potent adventurer, rugged individualist, American Hero), she as the ideal female (erotic woman, feisty), both contrasted with their shadows (the dull husband, the devoted mother etc), both contemptuous of bourgeois complacency and the unhappiness that arises from gender roles. The duo are linked from Hitchcock's very first shot, both actors' names side by side whilst couples circle in an intimate male/female waltz. The film will eventually end with Charlotte transforming from an independent woman to a domesticated \"wife\". In this way \"family\" is seen as threatening, a trap, no worse than outside.In the way Hitchcock muddies \"inside\" and \"outside\" the family, the film differs from many films of its era, which typically tried to shake viewers out of complacency by presenting idyllic families being infiltrated by evil, corrupting spectres (commies, fascists, creeps etc). Hitchcock, though, resists identification with the law, the authority, blurs the forces of good and evil, and paints \"normalcy\" itself as being something monstrous.Still, Charlotte's family members are a likable bunch. You have her adorable brother and sister, a passive father and a forlorn mother who constantly dotes on others. They counterpoint the headstrong, intelligent Charlotte, who symbolically dances Franz Lehar's Merry Widow waltz with Charlie, himself called the \"Merry Widow Murderer\". But Charlie's aberrations \u2013 stemming from a childhood tragedy in which he almost died - don't differ much from the \"mainstream\" aberrations of Hitchcock's uber-conservative, American family. Indeed, Charlie believes himself to be but a more \"pure\" and \"honest\" manifestation of the greedy, soulless \"civilization\" he sees around him. \"Money's become more important than souls,\" he mourns, the man a sick distortion of a sound moral attitude.And so Hitchcock literally positions a church opposite a mega-bank and positions sociopathy as the extreme reactive consequence of a societal preoccupation with wealth and profit. Charlotte's father, a banker, himself relaxes by playing games of death, human beings comically reduced to objectifiable \"things\" or \"playthings\", a game of death which Charlie later really \"plays\" with Charlotte. Elsewhere the film looks at the ruthlessness behind American benefaction: Charlie's murder money is used for philanthropic funds, church's sing ironic praises about Charlie and civic good and bloodshed are continually intertwined. Later it becomes clear that Charlie is obsessed with \"dirty truths\" due to shattered idealisations, and that Charlotte lives in a false idyll which is slowly shattered but which she nevertheless wishes to preserve. Indeed, she willingly turns a serial killer into a phony martyr, all for a community's fragile self-image. Though personally free from fantasy, she maintains a sense of civilised hypocrisy for the sake of town and mother.\"Doubt's\" an incredibly modern picture, Hitchcock's camera work, compositions, editing rhythms, strong-but-young female lead, sophisticated script, subversive themes and powerful uses of silence incredibly novel for a film released in 1943. At the time, films simply didn't look, feel and move like this. Almost, but not quite.10/10 \u2013 Masterpiece.",

            "content": "In Alfred Hitchcock's \"Shadow Of A Doubt\", suspicion and suspense develop side by side when fears start to grow that the arrival of a visitor in Santa Rosa, California, could threaten the tranquillity of the small town, the calm lifestyle of a very conventional family and also the life of a teenage girl. The story unfolds at a pace which is consistent with the sleepy surroundings in which it's set and contains moments of menace, misogyny, conflict and black humour. An uneasy atmosphere also prevails as it becomes increasingly apparent that beneath the community's respectable veneer something very dangerous exists.Charlie Newton (Teresa Wright) is a teenage girl who suffers extreme boredom living in an environment where everything is well ordered and predictable and she longs desperately for some excitement. The promise of this soon comes when her favourite uncle from Philadelphia arrives to stay with her family. Uncle Charles (Joseph Cotten) is a charming and successful businessman, her mother's brother and also the member of the family after whom she was named. Their names are not all that Charlie and her uncle share as they're also connected by a telepathic link and an example of this is seen when Uncle Charles gives his niece a ring and she starts to hum the same piece of music that he had on his mind at the time (\"The Merry Widow Waltz\").Soon after Uncle Charles' arrival, the family is visited by two men who work for a national polling organisation and they arrange with Mrs Newton (Patricia Collinge) for the entire family to be interviewed and photographed but Uncle Charles is clearly uncomfortable about this and refuses to cooperate. One of the men, Jack Graham (MacDonald Carey) later dates Charlie and confides in her that he's actually a detective who's checking up on her uncle as he's one of two suspects that are under investigation. Charlie is also then asked not to tell her family about the investigation.When her uncle hides a page from her father's newspaper, Charlie goes to the local library, peruses their copy and finds that the page in question carried a story about a hunt being carried out for the \"Merry Widow Murderer\". Furthermore she discovers that the initials engraved on the ring she was given by her uncle match those of one of the murder victims. A nightmare she has about her uncle running away from something, a speech he gives at dinner about his hatred of widows and his attitude to taking part in the survey, all serve to strengthen her strong suspicions that he's a murderer.Charlie's suspicions and the fact that she's unable to warn her family about the danger that lurks in their midst make her increasingly anxious and creates a conflict within her as she struggles to reconcile her contradictory impulses. Things get even worse however, when Uncle Charles realises what Charlie knows and as a consequence, her life is put in jeopardy.Knowing just how devastating it would be for her mother to find out the unpalatable truth about her favourite brother, Charlie readily cooperates with the detectives in a plan to resolve their case in a way which avoids scandal and saves her family from being disgraced by the associated fall out.The suspense in this movie is relieved periodically by some humorous moments which mostly arise from the exchanges between Charlie's father Joseph (Henry Travers) and his neighbour Herbie (Hugh Cronyn) who are both avid murder mystery buffs who enjoy discussing ideas for committing the perfect murder.The two characters at the heart of this story seem so strongly connected that they're almost like one entity within which good and evil, naivety and sophistication and also innocence and wickedness all coexist. This is symptomatic of the theme of duality which is present throughout the entire film and can be seen in the number of doubles featured (two Charlies, two detectives, two suspects, two attempts on Charlie's life etc).High angle shots are used effectively at certain points but the one in the library when Charlie has just discovered the information about the \"Merry Widow Murderer\" is outstanding. Similarly, interesting use is made of close-ups but the one which makes the most impact is seen when Uncle Charles makes his speech in which he viciously attacks the lifestyles and appearances of wealthy widows.The talented cast bring their characters to life convincingly and the events which follow Charlie's craving for excitement bring to mind the advice to \"be careful what you wish for\".",

            "content": "Shadow of a Doubt is perhaps Hitchcock's first real masterpiece - a more mature film than The 39 Steps or Rebecca. It is also incidentally his favorite of his own films. The sleepy town of Santa Rosa is far removed from the very real events of WW-2, events that figured at least a mention if not a central influence on most films of that period. Hitchcock's Rear Window and Vertigo were also far removed from the realities of the Cold War and the Communist Witch-Hunts of the 50's.Shadow is taut with sexual tension - the incestuous overtones of the mental affinity of niece and uncle Charlie, the lusty infatuations of Charlie's teenage friend Catherine, and Herb, who just happens to be around the corner where ever we see Charlie. Charlie, the niece, is played by Teresa Wright in one of Hitchcock's best female performances. She is very warm, innocent and genuinely good-natured - completely unlike Hitch's usual icy blonds. I have always found Joseph Cotten to be quite inexpressive. He is slightly better than his usual self and is believable in charming and winning over the small town-folk.This is probably Hitchcock's only film with a strong human core, coupled with his well-known skills as a master technician. What other director of the era could have revealed the murderer at the start of the film and still maintained tension and a lingering unease throughout. Shadow of a Doubt is a precursor to the menace of Blue Velvet and the sexual tensions of American Beauty - and stays with you much longer than either of them.",

            "content": "The Newton's live a peaceful life in Santa Rosa - and young Charlie decides to liven things up by inviting her uncle Charlie to visit.  She goes to the telegram office to find that he is already on his way.  Uncle Charlie brings excitement and makes a difference to the daily routine for the Newton's but Charlie's affection for him is threatened when two men turn up investigating her uncle's possible connection with the murders of several rich widows. With the clues pointing to Uncle Charlie being the Merry Widow Murderer, the relationship between the two breaks down in tension.I was attracted to Shadow of a Doubt by the presence of Joseph Cotten, an actor who's films I tend to enjoy on the whole - I was not aware that this was featured so highly on the imdb 250 chart and am quite surprised that it is.  The film takes little Charlie's desire for interest and excitement and makes it much more than she expected she would have expected.  The guts of the film is little Charlie's loss of innocence as she begins to suspect her uncle of being more than just the interesting man she thinks she knows; this aspect works pretty well as it gathers a good pace around this discovery - surprising considering we are never in doubt that Charlie is the killer. The plot is not perfect however, there are not so much holes as, well, gaps in the film that are perhaps difficult to accept.  These are mainly little things that don't make sense and seem to have been overlooked in favour of the central relationship dynamic.  As I say, this worked well but there were issues with the plot that didn't always ring true to me.The film has a palatable tension throughout, as I say, a feat made more impressive by the fact that I never had any doubt that Charlie was the killer.  This is the mark of a good director and Hitchcock does prove himself here (as if he had anything to prove!).  He not only fills the foreground with this tension but he also puts plenty of nice touches all around the film - be it the `how to murder' dialogue or the support characters themselves.  The main roles of course are the two Charlie's and both are interesting even if not totally clear.  Wright is great as the niece Charlie and is convincing in the emotions that she goes through. Cotten has a showier role but occasionally hams it up as a result, but mostly his dark ramblings are pretty much spot on.  Support is interesting from Hume Cronyn, Wonacott, Carey and the rest of the Newton family and they add detail around the story by being colourful while still allowing the lead pair to have a definite lead.Overall this is a good film although I must confess not to be as taken by it as I would have hoped.  The film is a little too slow and has a few too many gaps in it that served to annoy me a little bit and detract from the story. However Hitchcock uses the central two characters to build his tension and thus stops the plot gaps being too much of a problem.  Both Cotten and Wright lead the film well and a great director adds colour and uses their performances to generate tension and drive the film forward.  Not perfect and far from Hitchcock's best but still a very enjoyable film that is typically Hitchcockian in some if not all regards.",

            "content": "Hitchcock has a style that he uses in his thrillers that always manages to captivate me. Shadow of a Doubt was no exception as it instantly had me intrigued and anxious to see why Uncle Charlie was hiding. It keeps you on tenterhooks for the entire film, first wondering what is going on, and then wondering if our heroine will be safe. I love this kind of mystery, and how it fills me with excitement because I don't know what will happen next. Teresa Wright is a brilliant actress, and runs the gamut of emotions throughout the film. It's easy to empathize with her as she transitions from joy to fear. Joseph Cotten is also excellent in Shadow of a Doubt. He plays the enigmatic uncle with precision so that we could see him as both benevolent or dangerous depending on the situation.But I think where Hitchcock or the writers may have stumbled slightly with Shadow of a Doubt was revealing the truth about Uncle Charlie too early. To be clear, I don't mean that we shouldn't be clued in on what he is running from, because that helps escalate the tension. However, I wish they played it a bit more coy with the truth of why he's running. I don't know, perhaps that wouldn't work because he keeps acting guilty of something, but I still would be fascinated if there was that extra level of intrigue added, where we don't know if young Charlie should be scared at all. This is a minor tweak I'd make to the script, but certainly not a massive flaw in the story. I still appreciate that they maintained a level of taut thrills throughout, and had a surprising conclusion to the film. This definitely goes on my list of favorite Hitchcock movies, just not quite at the top.",

I love the heroine's pretentious angst in the beginning (good to know angsty teens are just a modern invention). I loved the slow build of the plot, and how well you are forced to consider what would you do in such an extraordinary case.But what I mainly love is Joseph Cotton's brilliant, dead-on performance as a psychopath. Genial and charming, he will flash a dangerous fury for just a moment then veer back to charming and easygoing without in blink of an eye. You see him smile and then, when no one is looking, you see the smile turn to calculation. He is chilling because you can both see how dangerous he is as well as why no one else can see it.I also love the many subtle ways they create the connection between the girl and her uncle, a relationship that at times looks dangerously close to a flirtation.While this is one of Hitchcock's least flashy films, if you go into it knowing that, you will be well rewarded.",

            "content": "Although it was the sixth film which Alfred Hitchcock made after his move to Hollywood, \"Shadow of a Doubt\" is his first major American thriller. \"Rebecca\" and \"Suspicion\" were both set in Britain and starred British actors in the leading roles. \"Foreign Correspondent\" has an American star but deals with the war in Europe; it is essentially a wake-up call to Americans, urging them to abandon isolationism and join Britain in the fight against Nazism. \"Mr & Mrs Smith\" is an atypical romantic comedy, and \"Saboteur\", a patriotic warning against Fifth Columnists, is very minor-league stuff.\"Shadow of a Doubt\" is set in Santa Rosa, California, here portrayed as the archetypal American small town where nothing ever happens. (One of the scriptwriters was Thornton Wilder of \"Our Town\" fame). It was something of a Hollywood convention to portray outwardly tranquil small towns as inwardly seething with hidden hatreds and passions, as in \"Kings Row\" made the previous year. Here, however, evil is something that comes into the town from outside. Charlie Oakley, a thirty-something bachelor, arrives in the town to stay with his married sister Emma Newton and her family. Unknown to them, however, Charlie is under suspicion of being the serial killer known as the \"Merry Widow Murderer\" who has killed several wealthy widows in the East, and two detectives have trailed him to California to keep him under surveillance.This is one of the minority of Hitchcock films which have a female protagonist and where the main male character is a villain. In this respect it has something in common with Hitchcock's later British film \"Stage Fright\". In both films, also, a romance develops between the heroine and the detective investigating the villain's crimes. In \"Shadow of a Doubt\" the heroine is Charlie's teenage niece, Charlotte. (She was named after her uncle and is sometimes referred to by the family as \" Charlie \", but to avoid confusion I will refer to her by her full name). One of detectives informs Charlotte privately that her uncle is a suspect in the \"Merry Widow\" case; at first she cannot believe consider that her beloved uncle could be a murderer, but his increasingly odd behaviour begins to arouse her suspicion.Hitchcock counted this as one of his best films, but for me it never quite reaches the highest level. It is considerably better than the likes of \"Saboteur\" or \"Stage Fright\", but would not rate it as highly as some of Hitchcock's British films such as \"The 39 Steps\" or \"The Lady Vanishes\" or American ones such as \"Rebecca\" or \"Strangers on a Train\". The main reason is that there always seems to be a major plot hole at its centre. It is never satisfactorily explained why, after Uncle Charlie admits to Charlotte that he is indeed the killer, she agrees to help him by keeping his secret. The explanation that she gives is that she does not want to distress her mother, who idolises her brother, but it must surely have occurred to an intelligent young woman like Charlotte that if she keeps quiet and gives him time to escape there will always be a risk that he will kill again. (How distressed would Emma be if she were to discover not only that her brother is a murderer but also that her daughter could have prevented one of his crimes but failed to do so?) It is also not explained why the truth about Charlie does not come out after his death- he dies trying to push Charlotte from a moving train- or who the mysterious \"second suspect\" is whom the police are chasing in Maine. The romantic subplot between Charlotte and Detective Jack Graham always seems rather unnecessary. Yet there are compensations, especially a very fine performance from Joseph Cotten as Charlie, by turns either jovial or sinister. Yet even when he is at his most affable there is always a hidden undercurrent of menace; when Charlie reveals himself as the killer we have, in a sense, been prepared for this revelation. Charlie's crimes are motivated by a dark, pessimistic philosophy; he believes the world to be a cruel and brutal place and that this justifies his behaving in a cruel and brutal manner. The women he killed were, in his view, \"fat animals deserving of slaughter\". (There are no direct references to the war in the film, but Charlie's contempt for human life recalls that of the Nazis, who often referred to Jews as \"animals\" or \"vermin\").Indeed, there is a dark thread running throughout the film, which is why some have seen it as one of Hitchcock's films noirs, even though the \"Pleasantville\"-type small town is different to the normal urban noir setting. Like many Hitchcock thrillers it contains elements of humour, although often of a dark, unsettling kind. Charlotte's father Joe and his friend Herbert are keen crime buffs, eagerly discussing detective novels, unsolved murder cases or the best way to commit the perfect murder, all the time comically unaware of the real murder mystery unfolding under their noses.Strangest of all is the relationship between Charlotte and Charlie, who before Charlie reveals his secret are unusually close for uncle and niece, perhaps too close for comfort. Some have even seen hints of incest in this relationship. Hitchcock may have been suggesting hidden, deeper reasons for Charlotte's reluctance to inform the police about her uncle. \"Shadow of a Doubt\" is not Hitchcock's greatest film, but it is certainly one of his most disturbing. 7/10",

            "content": "Shadow Of A Doubt was believed to have been Hitchcock's own favourite movie, the one that he was most proud of as he felt his critics hadn't got any justifiable ammunition to shoot him down with. The film stands out because it doesn't have the tongue in cheek dark humour traits that light up most of the maestro's classics. The cheeky bonus is that of having the central premise of the main protagonist being a hero of the people. His family all adore him, where he is on the surface a man that all men want to be, and it's here that Hitchcock moulds a chilling filmic arc, in fact, it's a masterstroke of filmic manipulation.The plot involves Uncle Charlie returning to his adoring family in Santa Rosa after avoiding his apprehension for the murder of a widow. His niece Charlie treats Uncle as a hero, she worships the ground he walks on, but as the detectives close in, niece Charlie starts to piece together things and suspects herself that Uncle may just in fact be The Merry Widow Murderer. We are then pitched into the cat & mouse story and become privy to Uncle Charlie's switch from debonair handsome hero, into that of the devil incarnate. The reoccurring theme of The Merry Widow Waltz adds to the uneasy feel, while the relationship between Uncle & Niece is one that I'm sure Hitchcock was revelling in. Make no bones about it, it's in itself bordering on being unhealthy, and it's something that helps make this a more edgier thriller than other genre pieces of the era.Joseph Cotten is special as Uncle Charlie, his duality acting hits the spot on both fronts, whilst Teresa Wright is beguiling as the niece because she really makes the character infectious. Thus it's with these two great performances that the pics final reel brings socko results. Screenplay is written by the wonderfully talented Thornton Wilder, and with the master directing with swagger in tow, this rounds out as a triumphant classic that shouldn't be missed by fans of such terminologies. 10/10",

But SHADOW OF A DOUBT, good film that it is, always disappoints me because of what I term is the problem of Hitchcock. His problem is his inability to resolve issues properly (or even present them properly).In many of his films, Hitchcock starts off certain points regarding the characters that are never fully developed properly. For example, in NORTH BY NORTHWEST there is an undercurrent of homosexual jealousy by Martin Landau towards the relationship of his boss James Mason with Eva Marie Saint. It culminates in the scene when, to prove a point about Saint's betraying Mason, Landau fires her gun point blank at a shocked Mason. Mason suddenly realizes it is loaded with blanks (that Saint fired it at Cary Grant, pretending to critically wound him, to impress Mason). He reacts swiftly, punching Landau in the face (he did not like being surprised like that), but fully believing what Landau showed him. This sequence seems to be setting up some future point in the film.It's a weak point possibly, but I always felt that the moment of resolution was that Mason should have been the man who stood over Grant and Saint when they were holding onto the cliff at Mount Rushmore, not Landau. Because, if you remember, in a desperate plea, Grant says, \"Please help us.\" I have always felt that Hitchcock missed the boat in putting the totally malevolent Landau over Grant and Saint at that moment - it should have been Mason. Because Mason, despite his own anger, did at one point like Saint (he showed a better side to his nature). If Saint had been the one hanging on for dear life, and pleading, and Mason after an initial moment of anger overcame it and started rescuing her just as Landau turned up, the ending would have been more interesting. Landau would then have felt betrayed by Mason, and might have pulled out a gun and shot him (this time fatally). It would have carried the relationship question to a more logical point.The same thing happens here in SHADOW OF A DOUBT. Young Charlie's problems with Uncle Charlie are compounded by the general liking felt by most people in the town for the latter. But if you notice, at various points in the film, members of Young Charlie's family do have \"shadows of a doubt\" about Uncle Charlie. Her father (Henry Travers) is humiliated in his bank job by Uncle Charlie hinting he is an embezzler, and that the books are cooked. Take a look at Travers when Joseph Cotton leaves laughing. It is one of curiosity and wonder compared to his general acceptance before. Young Charlie's two younger siblings notice Uncle Charlie's odd behavior destroying a newspaper to show them a trick, and then forgetting the trick (the paper had an article about the \"Merry Widow\" murder mystery. But finally there is Young Charlie's mother. She is mothering sister - we learn that she can't help it, after her parents died she only had her little brother Charlie (reading between the line she probably helped turn him into the selfish monster he is by spoiling him). But after the last of a series of accidents befall Young Charlie, as they all drive away to a social event, the mother says to herself that it is strange that so many bad things happened to her daughter, as though they were planned. This is never followed through (a point brought out on this thread in another comment). It should have been.Given her incredible fondness for her worthless brother, it would have been more interesting if Hitchcock had ended the film with a slightly different conclusion on that train. Suppose, while Uncle Charlie purposely delays his niece from departing the train, his sister (wondering what is delaying Theresa Wright) re-boards the train at a different door to catch Cotton trying to push Wright off. At that point a moment of truth might have occurred to the mother - and of shock. It would have been more interesting if in rescuing Wright, the mother pushes Cotton off the train into the path of the oncoming locomotive. Why Hitchcock or Thornton Wilder did not see such a simple conclusion to the problem (tying in with the idea of a \"shadow of a doubt\" theme) is just beyond my comprehension.",

            "content": "I was surprised to learn that Hitchcock valued this film above his other works. While not a bad film, \"Shadow of a Doubt\" is so devoid of the director's trademark suspense that I would strongly protest against its labelling as a \"thriller\".The plot trundles along nicely as Uncle Charlie, on the run, decides to lay low at his sister's house. However a succession of clues and an intervention by two mysterious police officers soon lead Charlie's niece (also Charlie) to begin to unravel the sinister truth behind his charming exterior.Joseph Cotten is fine as Uncle Charlie, convincing in his role as caring yet reclusive relative. However his portrayal of the murderous side of the character is hindered by a script which fails to impress upon the viewer any real sense of danger from the man. This affected my entire experience of the film, as I began not to care whether he was found out or not.Teresa Wright is also capable as Young Charlie, depicting strength and vulnerability.The rest of the cast is able, those in the family convincingly depicting an average American household (though the little girl annoyed me somewhat). I enjoyed the discussions about the perfect murder (foreshadowing the far superior \"Rope\") between Travers and Cronyn, however irrelevant they seemed. The theme of danger in an average life also appealed to me.Yet the film is let down by a poor script. The plot was convoluted, often veering erratically down pointless dead ends (the romance subplot between Young Charlie and the inspector seems particularly irrelevant). Believability was stretched as the film approached a disappointing anti-climax.\"Shadow of a Doubt\" is in many ways well executed; yet it lacked the essential substance and tension to properly capture my attention.6/10",

But what she just thinks is a playful little thing is actually a very dark and criminal thing; Uncle Charlie's on the run from the law, and her knowledge of his actions can turn to disastrous effects... like him willing to kill even her to keep his secret safe.DUH DUH DUH! No, but seriously, it was a very good look into the whole \"tearing the veil off of Suburbia\", a la Blue Velvet (I know, it came later) and Hitchcock's own repeated motif of \"looking behind the curtain.\" Within an average, normal (and very stressed as such) household, complete and diabolical evil exists.It's some good stuff. I can never really fault Hitchcock his skill or his technique because he was great at it. I just regret to say I get kind of tired of having him basically show variants of the same story over and over again. But considering that this was, apparently, his favorite film of his, and being that it's a lot more personal and psychological than the common \"mistaken-identity-man-on-the-run\" with the \"blond-woman-exploring-her-place-in-society-and-coming-of-age\" that he tends to do much more often, it is quite definitely one of his better works.--PolarisDiB",

This film is extremely talky and flatly photographed. In addition there are two rather annoying brat kids, one male and one female, who play no real part in the basic plot. Personally, IMHO, this film does nothing to deserve the praise that many reviewers on this forum have heaped upon it. I guess we watched this movie from vastly different perspectives.",

Charlie Newton (Teresa Wright) is a bored teenager who wants to contact her worldly uncle Charlie. To her surprise, he sent them a telegram right at the same time. He gives her an expensive ring inscribed with \"TS from BM\". Herbie Hawkins (Hume Cronyn) is the father Mr. Newton (Henry Travers)'s brother-in-law and both like to imagine the perfect murder stories. Uncle Charlie is hiding the newspapers and niece Charlie notices. He never has his picture taken. The last picture is a childhood photo just before his accident. Two men are coming over to interview a typical American family and want to take their pictures. When they take his picture, he takes the whole roll back. Niece Charlie figures out that the two men are detectives searching for a murderer and she agrees to keep quiet for the sake of her mother. She goes to the library and finds the newspaper with the story of the \"Merry Widow\" who had murdered three women with the last being Mrs Bruce Matthewson.There is a real creepy vibe between the uncle and niece Charlies at the beginning. That starts the movie off on the correct and uncomfortably awkward tone. As uncle Charlie's weird actions pile up, the suspense builds. Joseph Cotten taps into his inner villain. I think he is quite good playing this character. Teresa Wright is a little old when she's twenty something playing a teenager. She actually looks twenty something. That is maybe why the chemistry seems to be so creepy. This is a great creepy Hitchcock movie.",

            "content": "The film opens with a woman coming into a room to tell her lodger that two men have been asking to see him; he is clearly somewhat perturbed and soon after telegrams his sister in California to say that he will be coming to stay. It is a simple opening but somehow it had me hooked... was he running because he was in danger or was he running because he was a dangerous man wanted by the authorities? Coincidentally his niece Charlie is planning to write to him, her Uncle Charlie, to invite him to visit when the telegram arrives. When he gets there everybody is happy but there is something not quite right; he states that he refuses to be photographed, tears an article out of the news paper and when he realises the ring he has given his niece is already engraved with another set of initials he wants to get the old inscription removed... each thing in itself is fairly trivial but they add up to raise suspicions. Soon two men turn up asking to interview the family for a survey about an 'average American family'; later one of them confides in young Charlie telling her they are investigating her uncle. He is suspected of committing a series of heinous crimes but there is a second suspect in Maine so it is possible that he is innocent... young Charlie wants to believe he is but similarly it is hard to ignore the clues.After the interesting opening the film continued to keep be gripped and I was constantly changing my mind about whether Uncle Charlie was really a killer or whether he was innocent. Joseph Cotton puts in a fine performance; charming one moment potentially threatening the next; Teresa Wright is equally good as his adoring niece who wants to believe in him but finds it more and more difficult as the evidence stacks up. The rest of the cast are good too; I particularly liked Henry Travers, who played young Charlie's father, and Hume Cronyn, who played his friend Herbie in the scenes where they discussed crime fiction; in particular when they talked about how one might get away with murder... while this doesn't effect the plot it makes one wonder whether certain accidents are that or whether they are attempts at murder... their conversations are also very funny! Being a Hitchcock film I shouldn't have been surprised how well the tension was managed; he is of course the expert in the field; more surprising is that this isn't one of his better known works.",

            "content": "To which Ma Newton replies - \"It's your father's way of relaxing\".Director Alfred Hitchcock liked to use humor to diffuse the building tension in his films and to shift emphasis, and this movie offers a number of excellent examples. They're peppered throughout the story and offer needed breaks as it becomes more and more apparent that Joseph Cotten's character, Uncle Charlie, just might be the 'Merry Widow Murderer' that a country wide manhunt is after.There's no doubting that Hitchcock is one of the great directors of American cinema, but once again, I find myself on the fence regarding this picture's reputation and my own reaction to it. Maybe I'm being a tad too critical, but just like with \"Strangers On A Train\", I found the resolution to the story to be just a little too pat for my liking. Here was Uncle Charlie (Cotten), an athletic looking man revealed to be the killer of three widows for their inheritance, successfully challenged by his niece almost half his size. Would a murderer of his talent and skill allow himself to be angled into a position as to fall off a train into the path of another because he just slipped? It's just too convenient a scenario to serve as the finale.What might have better served the picture would be to have the story actually support the title. Hitchcock did a nice job with the initial attempt on Young Charlie's (Teresa Wright) life using the doctored step on the stairway; not really sure if it was tampered with or not. The garage scene with the running car and Young Charlie 'trapped' could have been presented with an outcome that didn't make it obvious that the Uncle was behind it. Of course, the train scene makes it certain that Cotten's character is the widow maker, as he pulls out all the stops to take out his niece for what she suspects, but doesn't necessarily know for certain (although the ring inscribed with 'T.S. from B.M.\" was a pretty good clue). I guess what I'm saying is that the film would have worked a whole lot better for me if Uncle Charlie's murder history was maintained as a \"Shadow of a Doubt\" instead of a certainty. What I'm thinking is along the lines of 1938's \"Angels With Dirty Faces\" - it's up to the viewer to decide if Jimmy Cagney died a hero or a yellow rat. It makes for a much livelier debate.Aside from that, the film did hold my interest all the way through, with well presented performances by the principals, along with Henry Travers, Patricia Collinge, MacDonald Carey and Hume Cronyn in good support roles. Ma Newton (Colllinge) did a nice job of putting two and two together in a very low key scene, and it was rewarding to know that she 'got it' regarding her brother's presence back home.Say, there was one scene that took me way back to when I first learned to drive a car. Do you recall Jack Graham (Carey) using a stick shift on the column when driving his car - when's the last time you saw that?",

As always, there's a great deal of mystery insidiously woven throughout the first act that immediately catches the viewer's utmost interest, and the development makes for a smooth watch. The casting is very good, with notably the at times breathtakingly beautiful and natural Teresa Wright as the very strong and bold female lead, and Cotten who plays his role of the perpetually suspect and obscure uncle just right. There's enough to go around to fill up the film convincingly, but the ending feels something of a rush. As very often with Hitchcock films, the ending is the least subtle part of the picture, something of a more ordinary finishing point than brought to expect - which definitely dents a good, sometimes great effort's worth. Almost like the film's had enough of itself and just wants to move on to the next.Pretty good film, definitely a smooth viewing and a few things to look forward to, just perhaps that last part. 7.5/10",

He sees an article about his crimes in the local paper and rips it out. There would be nothing to connect him otherwise. Charlie (the niece) then figures him out based on this story and a couple of other slips that he makes. (Years ago a friend ('L') began an extra-marital affair. To hide it, L crossed out the woman's name in 3-4 copies of his phone book. Incredibly, L's wife figured it out. For years L talked with some amazement about this detective work. The plot of this movie about as sharp.)Let's briefly consider the main plot: the \"detectives\" are after a serial killer; there are 2 suspects; one runs into an airplane propeller and dies. Do they say \"Shame we couldn't question him.\" or \"We need to focus on Charlie now.\"? Nope, they say \"Case closed\".These \"detectives\" allow at one point that there are people who can ID the killer via a photo. Do they just arrest the two suspects and photograph them? Or fly them back to the scene for ID? Or fly one of the witnesses out to see Uncle Charlie? They do not. Instead they come up with an elaborate ruse to photograph the house and this get a picture of Charlie.The dialogue is as stilted and tedious as any Thornton Wilder novel. It's much like a bad high school play, without the unintentional humor. Everyone overacts, Cotton more than most (and more than usual, if that's possible).It baffling that Hitchcock allowed this to be released; more amazing, he apparently considered it his favorite movie. We can only imagine that Wilder had some final say over the story or that AH himself was brain-dead throughout.It's painful to watch and an embarrassment to an otherwise fine director. There isn't a single good scene, subplot or piece of story. It's probably a 3/10 but because it's AH, it deserves 2/10.",

Opposite him is a doctor, who looks at him, and remarks \"Are you alright?\" soon after the doctor's female companion has suggested that he should take a professional look at another co-passenger the reclusive Charlie, played by Joseph Cotton. Why was Hitchcock looking unwell? He was looking at the incredible full grand slam of spades in his hand.The film's strength is not merely the suspense but the constant counterpoints of humor. Early in the film, Charlie is able to outwit two cops who try to follow him\u0097the humor of the sequence is captured visually.Then comes the niece Charlie's young sister who does not take down the telegram because she cannot find a pencil without making much of an effort to find one.Then you have Charlie's mother shouting into the telephone mouthpiece, which leads her precocious daughter to remind her that she need not shout to be heard on the other end.Then comes the comment from the telegraph operator who cannot distinguish telepathy from telegraph.Uncle Charlie alights from the train with the aid of a walking stick but walks briskly soon after. Hume Cronyn (the brilliant actor who went on to develop the script of \"Rope\") plays an armchair detective, who conjures up ways to kill people while others are eating their dinner. The list goes on.Thornton Wilder and Hitchcock must have seen the importance of counteracting grim comments like \"If you rip off the fronts of houses, you will find swine,\" the colorful statement that evil is everywhere, within families, in a nice town, in big cities. Just as the humor offsets the grim facts, the clich\u00e9 of white (innocence) vs. black (evil) is used in the two introductory shots of the two Charlies lying on their respective beds. The humor balances the misanthropy of uncle Charlie. If you discount the humor the film would be lifeless\u0097this is the missing element of the Nineties TV film remake of the same story, with interesting additional elements that are not present in Hitchcock's version.More than anything, Hitchcock and Wilder must have been pleased with themselves sculpting the structure of the story, the constant dualism in the alter egos of the two Charlies and two contrasting siblings (elder Charlie and younger Charlie's mother), and the innuendo of incest without showing direct evidence of it. The film would satisfy the creators more than the viewer. It might well be Hitchcock's favorite work but interesting as it is, it probably will never be the viewer's favorite Hitchcock film.",

Heralded as Hitchcock's finest, I was impressed by the IMDb.com score it received and I settled in for a wonderful film noir/suspense experience. What resulted was a blatantly boring linear plot w/many unbelievable plot points that were very annoying, and an unsatisfying ending. First I will mention the one great thing about this film: the plot which is superb in its own right although poorly executed by the \"Shadow\" in this case and the acting of Joseph Cotton. I watched Cotton in other films--very bland in \"Gaslight\" for example and thought he did an outstanding job showing uneasiness with the fear of being suspected as the murderous villain. So great acting range from him made the movie tolerable. This is about all the praise the movie deserves. The beginning reels you in with a clever and suspenseful look at Cotton hiding out in his rented room trying to avoid men pursuing him. The interest vanishes however in the viewer when Cotton arrives to California to visit/hide out with his family. What follows is the niece's attempt at discovering why her uncle (Cotton) is acting so strangely. Suddenly this innocent girl transforms into a Sherlock Holmes with an esp-like ability to guess/predict everything about her uncle's doings/identity. Other than Cotton, the rest of the acting is forgettable in the movie. Somehow w/no explanation the cops are hot on Cotton's trail!! He traveled from east coast to west coast and within a short time the cops know who he is and where he is?? The problem with this movie, is there is just no suspense; also I felt it was impossible that a smart criminal like Cotton was outsmarted by his young/innocent niece with really no hard facts to go on. These are the little details that kept happening throughout the movie that made it very unsatisfying. Oh yeah, and what really nailed it for me was the ending: Cotton struggles w/his niece on a train, between the carts, and she shoves him to his death off the train (done w/atrocious special effects by the way). A 6ft 2in 200lb man being outwrestled by his 5ft 5 100lb niece? I would not mind this lack of believability if it was a minor part in a movie that served to advance some minor plot point, but this was THE most important part of the movie, the climax where it all ends and comes to a point. It was a huge letdown. If you enjoy a good story, find a book version of this movie, because Hitchcock's linear approach makes it all but impossible to be surprised at what happens for the next hour and a half of the movie.",

Before his first night is over, he's already acting strange, tearing up Dad's newspaper and then snatching it away from too-smart Teresa Wright (playing teenage detective, but not looking very happy about it).

(She was named after him.) At first, Charlie and her mom, Emma (Patricia Collinge) are delighted with his visit, especially when it appears he wants to settle in their town. Soon, however, Charlie finds out that things are not what they seem, and her beloved uncle may be a serial killer of wealthy widows. The more Charlie discovers, the more determined her uncle is to keep those discoveries from being known, whatever that takes. Meanwhile, a young detective on the case, Jack Graham (Macdonald Carey) falls for Charlie. She's torn between wanting to help her new love, and wanting to protect her uncle, whom she soon starts to see for what he really is.There's an interesting theory briefly mentioned, when Emma recalls a time when Charles had been injured as a boy when he took a bad fall, and they weren't sure if he'd recover, or if he'd be the same. Could that head injury account for the man he became?This is one of Alfred Hitchcock's finest.",

This is exemplified by unique camera angles,delivery of character dialogue, set pieces, and of course the suspense. As is the way of Hitchcock, he has a knack of making the actors fit neatly into their character roles. This is particularly the case of Joseph Cotton, who plays a sinister character in Uncle Charlie, who is only made to appear clean living by being placed into the context of residing with the all American, Church going family. Therefore it is by making Uncle Charlie at odds with his clean living family, which creates the intensity, and suspense for the audience who know different, in that it realises all along that he is not all that he appears to be.Uncle Charlie relies heavily on his relationship with his niece and name sake Charlie to make him appear like butter wouldn't melt. However, as soon as Niece Charlie puts two and two together and comes to realise the truth about her Uncle the close relationship between them deteriorates at a rapid pace. But, it is less the fact that niece Charlie realises what her uncle really is, but it is because she is growing into a woman that Charlie doesn't like. In becoming a woman niece Charlie now represents all that her uncle can't abide. And it is this misogynistic streak in Uncle Charlie that compels him to attempt to murder his niece, as opposed to what she knows of him.In all, this film has an excellent cast who give their all for Sir Alfred Hitchcock.",

Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten) is on the run from the law on the East Coast, and he settles in with his sister and her family in Santa Rosa. Trouble is just behind him though, and it gets worse when his niece (also 'Charlie', named after him, and played by Teresa Wright) begins to suspect him of being the \"Merry Widow Murderer\".I considered a slightly higher rating, but thought the pace in the first half of the movie was a little slow. Some of the tension is also missing because we're pretty darn sure Uncle Charlie is guilty. On the other hand, there is a real small town feeling to this setting, helped in no doubt by Thornton Wilder being one of the screenwriters, and the characters of Charlie's father (Henry Travers) and his friend (Hume Cronyn) passing the time by talking about the perfect murder are absolutely priceless. The second half, including the increasing revelation of Uncle Charlie's dark views of humanity and the lengths to which he will go to protect himself, is what make the film so sinister. As the movie came out during WWII, it seems to have a direct parallel to the evil leaders loose in the world, particularly in the film's final scene.",

Still, it's a very solid bit of work and is certainly an effective psychological thriller. It stars Joseph Cotten in a sinister role as an uncle from hell who suddenly turns up at the home of his sister's family after being away for a very long time. His niece, in particular, dotes on him but the trouble is that he is a seriously bad egg. The film doesn't really operate as a mystery as the audience always knows what is going on; the tension comes from watching characters that do not. Cotton is really great as Uncle Charlie and shows what a fine and versatile actor he was. The rest of the cast are mostly good, with a notably funny turn from Hume Cronyn as a nerdish neighbour who is obsessed with murder-mysteries. The film has a good mix of family dramatics and suspense, with the small town setting captured very well to add a fine backdrop to proceedings.

Shadow of a Doubt mixes evil into the stew of small-town Americana so comfortably that we fail to completely realize how threatening a presence it is until it is almost too late. Was Hitchcock just what Wilder's sentimental heart needed to make this project click; or was Wilder just who Hitchcock needed to cloak his menace with wholesomeness? In some crazy way this combination of great artists produced a classic thriller. No other Hitchcock film depicts ,so effortlessly, family relationships as part of a community. Joseph Cotten's evil heart seems right at home in this idyllic little town, which eagerly embraces him after he arrives. Only when he reveals something of his dark nature to his smart niece does she begin to realize the danger he poses to her family and her way of life.

I just cannot fathom anyone who sees any consistency in his work, even the way he handles the camera.\"Rear Window\" and \"Vertigo\" were masterpieces, novel cinematic narrative integrated into highly self-referential stories. I think in some way, they were the result of some happy accident and the peak of collaboration with his wife, who seems to have been the brains behind the narrative devices. Hitch seemed to have good visual intuition, novel ideas about who the camera was, and good production skills. But she was the genius.She's not much in evidence here. Instead we have the lazy Hitchcock, the one who relies on tension. But this time, it isn't something we know that the characters don't: its something both we and the main character know. Sure, there's a small town and a small town home with evil visiting. But its hardly enough to sustain a long form film. There's one cinematic stroke only, with the rest is an effect that simply doesn't work: the tune of a waltz. We actually see the dancers at the beginning and end, and we hear the tune repeatedly. But the dancing itself means nothing; its the WORDS to the song that are supposed to matter. But if you listen to them, they don't, even remotely. This reference through three filters \u0097 dancers, to waltz music, to the words to the music, to a point in the plot \u0097 isn't worthy of anyone.I'm going to recommend that you not watch this, because seeing any of Hitch's better films again would be better than seeing this one once.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",

            "content": "Many of Alfred Hitchcock's films during the 1940s were little more than propaganda flicks that seemed to have more to do with nationalism than truly creative movie-making. Fortunately, \"Shadow of a Doubt\" is a much more visceral tale dealing with the loss of innocence and small- town life.For a basic plot summary, \"Shadow of a Doubt\" sees Charlie (Joseph Cotten) on the run from the police in New York. Charlie evades the law by catching a train to the West Coast and hunkering down with his family in California, who know nothing of his shady past and view him as almost a sort of saint. However, Charlie's namesake niece (Teresa Wright) starts to piece together what Charlie is up to, putting both herself, her family, and the entire town in potential danger.This film is a better Hitch effort because of its insistent themes. Though because the time period was one of more restraint when it came to controversial themes at the box office, \"Shadow of a Doubt\" manages to still create a creepy atmosphere that at times is very uncomfortable. The idyllic community myth is shattered by the likes of characters like Charlie, who uses lies and manipulation to continue a spree of lawlessness. These themes could be done much more prominently and grittier in today's Hollywood, but in the early 1940s the hints were likely enough to put viewers in a suspenseful mood.Overall, then, \"Shadow of a Doubt\" is a solid Hitchcock flick that easily deserves a watch from fans of Hitch. I wouldn't consider it to be Hitch's crowning achievement (as he always thought it was), but it is nearer to the top than to the bottom.",

The second world war was at its height with American troops landing in North Africa and leading the fight against the Japanese in the Pacific . Strangely these events are ignored in the narrative and unless I'm greatly mistaken I don't even think the war is referred to in any depth . Mind you Hitchcock had previously made a movie set around Nazi traitors in America ( As had several studios at the time )so I guess many movie makers just wanted to move onto conventional thrillers devoid of patriotic subtextWatching this movie today I'm in two minds about it . I found the \" Uncle Charlie is a good guy \" slightly overplayed as he gives presents to his family and they greatly receiving them without any questions as to where the money came from or where he got them from but I did remind myself that very few people ever look a gift horse in the mouth and human beings are often overwhelmed by successful people in the hope that this rubs off on them so I shouldn't criticise any characters in the movie as being too gullible . I also guess people in those days were a lot more trusting than in the cynical late 20th and 21st centuries At the end of the day SHADOW OF A DOUBT has the persuasive idea that people aren't who they always say they are and you shouldn't take people on trust , but is this actually groundbreaking enough to make it a classic thriller in the way NIGHT OF THE HUNTER is ? Despite this criticism at least Hitchcock cast character actor Joseph Cotton as Uncle Charlie . If it was remade today we'd have Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise all teeth and smiles and a very poor script",

            "content": "During the 1940s, Hitchcock made a LOT of films about mysterious characters with possibly sinister intentions (usually starring the likes of Gregory Peck or Cary Grant). SHADOW OF A DOUBT is my favourite of these so far, a gripping and intelligent mystery in which a bright young girl's kindly Uncle Charlie may in fact be much more than he at first seems.The script is pitch perfect and the pacing exact. Some have noted the thematic parallels to the story of Dracula, but these are too subtle to make much of. As with SUSPICION and SPELLBOUND, much fun comes from the \"is he or isn't he?\" premise, but to SHADOW OF A DOUBT's credit, it continues to thrill even after the mystery has been resolved. It's a subtle film that emphasises realism for the most part, so there are no murder or chase scenes, just quietly building tension that closes with a still-thrilling climax.Teresa Wright is an unfamiliar actress to me, but she's given more screen time than most Hitchcock actresses and she shines as the fresh-faced innocent. Joseph Cotton, who I'd previously only known in the latter stages of his career, is also excellent as the friendly Uncle Charlie, who never once fails to be charismatic or polite during the entire running time. There's further solid support from the likes of Macdonald Carey and a particular highlight is the comic ghoulish interplay between Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn, two men obsessed with pulp crime and who remain totally oblivious to the real story unfolding in their midst.",

            "content": "In addition to being the \"master of suspense\", Shadow of a Doubt should give Alfred Hitchcock a claim at being one of the first and best of the film noir generation. That might seem odd, given the many surface differences between this movie and the rest of the genre. The story is set in a bright and cheerful small town, not the dark and menacing inner city. Most of its characters are much more normal, upright and socially functional. There's relatively little violence here and a great deal of humor. But under the surface and beyond Hitchcock's artistry, the black and cynical blood of noir courses through this film's veins.Shadow of a Doubt spins around the axis of young Charlotte \"Charlie\" Newton (Teresa Wright) and her namesake Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten). Charlie is a far too earnest girl who chafes at the ordinary life of her ordinary family in her ordinary home town of Santa Rosa, California. She especially laments the life of family service that defines her mother, Emma (Patricia Collinge). When flamboyant and irrepressible Uncle Charlie comes to town for a visit, young Charlie is ecstatic. Not only because Emma is overjoyed to be reunited with her baby brother, who brings to life all her most cherished memories, but because the two Charlies aren't just uncle and niece. They're kindred spirits that recognize they are different than other people.However, Uncle Charlie isn't just visiting his dear relatives. He's on the run from the East Coast, pursued by two detectives, and from his very first moments on screen, the audience is shown a bleak darkness that simmers under Uncle Charlie's audacious charm. He is a man with a secret, one that's eating away at him and will forever change the life of his beloved niece.Like just about all his other movies, Shadow of a Doubt is filled with striking and powerful imagery. There are some young fools who don't appreciate Hitchcock's greatness and it is easy to understand why. By the time they get around to watching his work, they've seen his style and techniques aped by innumerable lesser filmmakers. Even with today's technology, many directors are still following in Hitchcock's footsteps. They're just going a step or two past the physical, material limitations he faced. It's only when you ponder how a movie made nearly 70 years ago can look and flow better than most modern films that you can appreciate the genius at work.The chief argument against putting this movie in the film noir genre is that it does not embrace and wallow in the blackness of life. It doesn't cast evil as the truth and good as merely pretense, but Hitchcock and his writers infuse almost every inch of this ordinary family and their ordinary lives with pain and anger and unease. It's not only Uncle Charlie's hidden malevolence or young Charlie's awakening rage. It's Emma's profound sadness at the childhood she desperately wishes she had back. It's Charlie's father Joseph (Henry Tavers) feeling uncomfortable at Uncle Charlie superseding him in the family dynamic. There's also Joseph's unusual hobby of talking with fellow detective magazine fan Herbie Hawkins (Hume Cronyn) about the best way the two of them could murder each other. The burned out waitress in the dance hall where the two Charlies have their first confrontation is a girl Charlie's age but with all the life beaten out of her. The difference between the two couldn't be more stark. Shadow of a Doubt is all about the mean underside of human existence and how it seeps up into the sunny surface.There are also some excellent performances on display here, something for which Hitchcock films are not always known. Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten are spectacular. Henry Travers and Patricia Collinge are amazing. These are probably some of the most real and genuine characters to ever be in a Hitchcock movie.Capped off with a truly wicked ending, Sadow of a Doubt is a great motion picture. It's not surprising Hitchcock called it his favorite film. Watch it and it might be yours.",

            "content": "You can tell Theresa Wright's wardrobe was done by Adrian, who had a penchant for mannish contours.  She wears one suit that seems to have a curtain rod thrust through the shoulders.  Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't have such shoulders.  In order to be built like that without props you'd have to be Bronco Nagurski.  I liked some of her shoes, though, a pair of white heels with brown tips, somehow so pure looking.  Maybe they are spectator pumps.  (What ARE spectator pumps?)Hitchcock always claimed this was one of his favorites.  Maybe it was.  It was shot on a very small budget under wartime restrictions yet it's gripping.  Thornton Wilder was just the writer to capture the nuances and quotidian details of small-town life, as he'd shown in \"Our Town.\" Hitchcock himself was born into a family of modest means but he quickly put his background and his family behind him.  He shot in varied locations but the point of view he presented was almost always a middle-class tourist's.Some of the details were undoubtedly the contribution of the director and his wife, Alma.  It's amazing, really, how much effort Hitchcock put into small bits of business considering that the word \"art\" had hardly any meaning in the context of American popular movies at the time.  More than once he changes a scene from a shot of Uncle Charlie to one of Little Charlie, both in the same positions, perhaps flat on their backs in bed, connecting the two characters by simple visual means.  And when Cotton, as the uncle, races after Wright, as Little Charlie, he grabs her by the arm and hustles her off the bustling, innocent early evening street and through the doors of a shabby noisy bar called \"Till Two,\" while she protests, \"I've never been in a place like this before.\"  Indeed she hasn't, not physically and not morally.  But it's Uncle Charlie's kind of place allright.  At their table Uncle Charlie begins to insult her, ridiculing her for her ignorance, telling her that \"the world is a foul sty,\" all his charm gone.  The exchange, which is critical, could have been turned by another director into something dull and strictly functional.  But Hitchcock had a gift for lifting such scenes out of the ordinary.  While Uncle Charlie is explaining how rotten the world is, and why those rich greedy women deserved to die, he takes a paper napkin, folds it, and begins to strangle it distractedly with his strong hands, while Charlie stares in horror.  And I doubt that anyone other than Hitchcock was responsible for the scene at the railway station when Uncle Charlie's train arrives at small tranquil abnormally normal Santa Rose -- with a huge billowing plume of black smoke hovering over the locomotive as it rolls to a halt.  What an image!Joseph Cotton is always elegantly dressed, even flamboyantly dressed.  He cracks sadistic and ill-timed jokes.  But he's handsome too, and generous and friendly, and he seems genuinely to love the only remaining members of his family.  His rich baritone is confident, and we can believe he knows what he's talking about.  At the beginning of the movie, however, as he is about to be nabbed by two detectives, he seems so tired that we feel kind of sorry for him, although to be sure we don't know exactly what he's done yet. Theresa Wright's voice has a stagey trained quality that makes it hard to believe her, but she's such a petite and appealing actress that it's easy to suspend our disbelief.  Her theatrical quality is matched by her mother. Little Charlie has two younger siblings, one of them one of Hitchcock's homely little girls with glasses.  MacDonald Carey is from Sioux Falls, Iowa, or someplace.  Hume Cronyn as the neighbor is creepy.The score is by the ever-popular Dmitri Tiomkin.  If he accomplishes nothing else, he does a fine job of establishing an atmosphere of unease by transposing a graceful Strauss waltz into a minor key.  The photography is fine too.  And Hitchcock's cameo appearance is one of his most humorous, even if we don't see his face.  We only see his bridge hand, a grand slam in spades, and one of the other players remarks to him, \"You don't look so good yourself.\"  There's another point, the explanation of Uncle Charlie's murderous propensities.  The dialogue must have been Wilder's.  As a child, it seems, Charlie's bike skidded on some ice and he was thrown into a streetcar, his skull fractured, and when he emerged from the coma he was never the same.  I feel the explanation MUST have come from Wilder's script because if Hitchcock had had anything to do with it he would have stuck it to Uncle Charlie's mother!",

            "content": "It has been repeatedly pointed out here that SOAD is one of Hitchcock's films most overlooked by contemporary audiences, but it must be remembered this film was highly regarded for 30 years following its original release. Of course, more time has passed since then, so the film can't help but be dated at present, although such a status is intriguing as it shines light on the values and mores of an earlier time in America, and as such, is instructive.The strong points of the film are obvious: very well shot and attractive looking flick, outstanding job by the very great Joseph Cotten, and Theresa Wright, usually a pretty limp and wan actress, puts forth the best performance of her career. Both principals are well supported by the rest of the cast (particularly the Mother, the younger Sister, and Hume Cronyn as the next-door-neighbor). The film offers a charming glimpse of small town life in an America now long dead, and despite assertions by a poster that the wartime feel of the picture is absent, there are subtle but telling references to this off-screen catastrophic event (i.e., the presence of servicemen in at least two scenes, the notice in Oakley's brother-in-law's bank to Buy War Bonds and Stamps, Oakley's statements (in two scenes) that the world outside is evil, a \"sty,\" and the Mother's insistence that the family \"help the government\" i.e., cooperate during wartime, when the two \"surveyors\" come to call). The various types of sexual tension in the film are palpable, and quite advanced for a picture of its time. And the little touches are great: Hitchcock's cameo, the brief bit with the waitress in the \"Till Two\" club, the assertions made by the clergyman at the family's after-speech party, the comic relief offered by the child actors.The weak points are glaring: doddering pacing and rather ill-focused editing, a pat and too-convenient explanation for Oakley's violent acts (i.e., head injury), a clumsy handling of the presumed budding romance between young Charlie and the detective, the needlessly dramatized episode of young Charlie in the library which supplies gratuitous suspense and tension that's hardly needed at that point in the picture, and a most contrived and implausible climax, albeit pretty harrowing if one exercises a suspension of disbelief.There are some plot holes that have been mentioned, and some others that have not. Of course, there's the over-generous openness of the family to the two \"surveyors,\" the quick rise of Uncle Charlie as small town hero, the depositing of $40K at the bank without concern or suspicion on the part of others, the lack of curiosity about and ready acceptance of Uncle Charlie's mysterious past and the eventual disregard of Uncle Charlie's photograph as evidence in regard to several serial murders: these have all been mentioned here. What I found to be an odd episode in the film was young Charlie's near-fatal incident in the garage: despite the fact that she was almost killed, the rest of the family hurries off to Uncle Charlie's speaking engagement, leaving her home alone as if nothing more serious happened to her than a stubbed toe.All in all, viewing this film in a theater last night (the first time I had seen it in about 15 years), I was slightly disappointed in how it played and felt that it has not held up particularly well since my last viewing. Maybe because this film played as a double feature with \"Out of the Past\" my perceptions were such. In comparison, the Robert Mitchum-Jane Greer-Kirk Douglas noir classic made SOAD seem dowdy, small and unaccomplished: in the final analysis, I recognized \"Out of the Past\" to be the superior film.SOAD is still worth viewing, but with the above caveats in mind.",

Charlie (Joseph Cotten) is a man who goes to visit his relatives in Santa Rosa, California. He is so well respected by his relatives that they named their oldest daughter (Teresa Wright) Charlie. When Uncle Charlie first arrives, everything seems to be going very nicely and everyone is having a lot of fun. But then, Young Charlie begins to get suspicious.That's as much as I'm going to tell you about the plot, because I worry that any more information will give everything away. However, I will discuss some interesting aspects in the movie. For starters, duality. There are two Charlies, two bespectacled females, two trips to the train station, two trips to the restaurant, and even when Alfred Hitchcock makes his cameo, he is carrying a piece of luggage almost as big as he is. This all may have something to do with the idea that there are two sides to everything (which turns out to be an important aspect in this movie). Also, Santa Rosa looks like a town in a Norman Rockwell painting, but then, everything changes.In one scene, Young Charlie is trying to call people on the phone, but can't reach them. Each time they show her again, the scene is shot from a higher angle, as though she is sinking deeper into desperation.I guess that overall, the movie is about how Young Charlie is forced to grow out of her youthful impression of the \"good old days\", as represented by \"The Merry Widow Waltz\", played during a repeated scene of a grand ball. The words \"merry widow\" also play a role in the plot.That is all that I can tell you. Any more would definitely give away the ending.",

The film is spectacular with great acting, I especially love Charlie (the uncle) who delivers an amazing and even scary (when we get the confirmation that he is indeed an assassin) performance. The film is very suspenseful even during moments that you'd think couldn't be thrilling like reading the newspaper, building up to the amazing and perfect climax near the very end.\nOverall even though I don't think this film is completely flawless I still think it's a masterpiece and, at least for now, my absolute favourite film of all time.\n10/10",

Umpteen times later Shadow Of A Doubt is still an enjoyable experience, albeit masterful storytelling mixed with hokey non-sequiteurs. Both suspects got abruptly minced, but shame about the other one who was apparently innocent, I wonder what his story would have been! He would have had every right to be cut up about it all.On the run suspected murderer Uncle Charlie rather shortsightedly judges all others as he judges himself, as grasping sleazebags, the gradual realisation of which causes Young Charlie the worst growing-up pangs imaginable. And the counter-realisation in Old Charlie introduces attempted murder into the idyllic suburban familial household he's chosen to try to hide in - there's nothing like a young person's violent death to avert suspicion. One of the investigating cops (BlanderMan) falls for Young Charlie, which would surely have muddied the waters if the Case had come to trial. Small town America in Santa Rosa seemed to be a very busy, vibrant place to live too.However, these are (to me) all minor points in what is a classic American film told in Hitch's inimitable style and already well applauded in many other comments. Not perfect but a marvellously intelligent, bright, and cohesive plot, acting and production will ensure its survival in the public domain way beyond the DVD and all of us, lovers or haters of it.

            "content": "\"Shadow of a Doubt\" was the first truly American film by Alfred Hitchcock. His previous films in Hollywood had strong overtones of being in a British setting but that all changed after 1943 with the release of \"Shadow of a Doubt.\" A psychopathic killer who is wanted in connection with a series of brutal killings, flees his home city and travels many miles to a small town where his relatives live. He attempts to conceal his real demeanour with that of being \"the charming and easygoing long lost uncle.\" He maintains this facade until his niece (Teresa Wright) suspects her uncle is not quite what he claims to be. There soon develops a game of cat and mouse between uncle and niece as her suspicions lead to her distancing herself from him and his smokescreen gradually evaporating as a result. The scene where Wright looks up some old newspaper articles at the local library, is a major development in her discovering what her uncle really is. Joseph Cotton was usually cast as the decent and ordinary everyday kind of character. When I first discovered he played a killer in a Hitchcock movie, I had slight reservations as to his suitability and credibility. Boy was I wrong! The actor makes for a creepy and sinister murderer who shows no remorse for what he has done. Hitchcock got precisely the right of performance from Joseph Cotton, there is nothing theatrical or superficial about it. Teresa Wright does a good job in projecting both vulnerability and determination. It is quite disturbing how the rest of the family are completely unaware of what is happening during the film. To them, Cotton is just a kind and ordinary person, like the sort of person you pass in the street. Hitchcock's creative juices were in full flow in \"Shadow of a Doubt.\"",

What is Cotton running away from if indeed anything? The relationship between the two Charlies is put to the test as we reach a suspenseful climax.The film suffers from a slow beginning once Cotton arrives at his sister's house. The two children are very annoying and so the film drags whenever they show up in a scene. The film doesn't need them. Also, I found Collinge's smiling facial expressions quite sickly. In fact, she is dreadful throughout and her voice just grates as the sweet mother figure. Yuk! Kill her, someone\u0085\u0085please! The women are not very good in this film. Even Teresa Wright in the lead is pretty annoying although she gets better as things progress. And stop saying \"Uncle Charlie\" all the bleeding time.

The plot is pretty simple as a young woman (Teresa Wright) begins to think that her loving uncle (Joseph Cotten) might be a killer. Here's another one that I remembered liking more back in the day but this still remains a rather nice and satisfying thriller, although I didn't care too much for how it ended as it seemed to be walking a tight rope just like Suspicion did with its controversial ending. Outside of that Hitchcock does a nice job building suspense from start to finish, although I'm not really sure if we, the viewer, was every suppose to really suspect that the uncle might not be a killer. From my point of view, the viewer is suppose to know Cotton is the killer while the young girl is suppose to find out along the way. With that in mind, that takes some of the suspense away because I feel it would have worked better had we not known just like the girl. However, perhaps we're not suppose to know and I just didn't see it that way. As with any Hitchcock film you get some very strong performances from the entire cast but the highlight here is without question Cotten who is the perfect snake of a man. At times he comes off very charming but at the same time he pulls off that devilish smile so well. Henry Travers is always fun to watch as is Wallace Ford in his small role.",

Hitch was undoubtedly a master of the form and no one knew better than he about setting up small chunks of info that would come into play later, rewarding the discerning viewer; however, I sat through each tedious detail wondering when/how they'd become significant. Secondly, the pacing had none of Hitch's rhythm. Suspense would build and then and just hang there, unresolved. I felt tense the whole time, but not in suspense, just in discomfort. Finally, I didn't care about any of the characters. The only performances I felt drawn to were Joseph Cotten as the psychotic Uncle Charlie and Hume Cronyn as the eccentric Herbie Hawkins. I found myself either cheering for Charlie (not to be confused for the disconcerting sympathy Hitch creates for Norman Bates) or wishing Herb and Roger would continue discussing their paperback murder scenarios. And, honestly, did anyone else not find Patricia Collinge painful to watch? I enjoyed how the relationship between Uncle Charlie and Young Charlie deteriorated and, of course, the film itself was beautifully shot, but, beyond that, I feel this was quite the dud.",

It is a very nice transfer, marginally better than the regular DVD.There are a handful of Hitchcock films that would be my \"favorites\", and this is one of them...perhaps my very favorite...which made me all the more want to watch it again when I learned that it was Hitchcock's favorite film, as well. And then I watched the documentary on the film on the DVD, and although I knew the story well, it put some aspects of it into better perspective.What I will call the prelude is in two parts. In the first part of the prelude we learn that Joseph Cotton is in some rather poor neighborhood in an eastern city, and is being watched, probably by the police...and he says to himself that they haven't got anything on him. He heads to a telegraph office. In the second part of the prologue, we are invited into small-town America...where the pace is slow...and we meet the \"innocents\" -- Cotton's sister (wonderfully realized by Patricia Collinge; while she wasn't a prolific movie actress, I've always enjoyed seeing her in a film), her husband (warmly -- as always -- played by Henry Travers), a young girl and a young boy, and the main focus of the film -- Teresa Wright, as an older daughter nicknamed Charlie after her uncle (Cotton). She's looking for something to break the monotony of a small town, and decides to invite her uncle for a visit. Both Charlies seem to be on the same wavelength! In the next segment, evil (Cotton) arrives in small town America, and for no good reason (other than effect) a shadow envelopes the train station as the train arrives. And then evil is invited into the home. And it first personifies itself with the humming of a tune -- \"The Merry Widow Waltz\", which Cotton attempts to change the topic, because he is the infamous \"Merry Widow Murderer\". (In fact, if you don't \"get\" the \"Merry Widow Waltz\" connection, you miss a big part of the picture's subtleties.The third segment is when Teresa Wright begins to realize something is not quite right. The newspaper article, the rough hand, an undercover police officer dating her to ask for her help. This is when the suspense begins building. And then the clincher -- a ring with an inscription.The final segment is how can Teresa Wright get rid of Uncle Charley, whom she knows is the murderer...even though the police wrongly think the real murderer was killed in a freak accident? I can't say that the (his) end is totally surprising, but how they get there is.Teresa Wright is fantastic as the young lady of the family who begins to suspect her uncle. Joseph Cotton is also wonderful. Both of these actors are somewhat forgotten today, but are just terrific actors.There are a couple of other supporting actors here worth mentioning. Macdonald Carey plays a detective, as does Wallace Ford. Both do nicely. Hume Cronyn plays an oddball neighbor who, along with Charlie's father, loves hashing over crime fiction. He's a hoot! This is absolutely top-notch Hitchcock at his best! Highly recommended, and it's on my DVD-Blu Ray shelf.",

It turns out that Uncle Charlie has beaten her to the punch because while at the post office, she finds that he has already sent one to them, announcing his upcoming arrival. Unfortunately, what Charlie and her family don't know is that he is coming because he is on the run from the police, as he is under suspicion for being \"The Merry Widow Killer\", a man who romances wealthy older women and then bilks them of their money before disposing of them. While Uncle Charlie charms the family, Charlie begins to suspect that her uncle may not be what he claims to be, suspicions that could threaten her life.One thing I have always admired about Alfred Hitchcock is his amazing ability to take something or someone that we assume is safe and turn them into a source of terror. He did it with a shower in \"Psycho\", childhood friends in \"Rope\" and even was able to turn some harmless window gazing into a life-and-death situation with \"Rear Window\". In \"Shadow of a Doubt\", he not only turns a beloved family member into a murderous threat, but set the film in one of the most idyllic towns in the country, where no one would think to lock their doors, much less do it to keep out a serial killer living in their midst. It's like Thornton Wilder mixed with Edgar Allen Poe, featuring Jack the Ripper as the \"hero\". Actually, with irony befitting Hitchcock, he enlisted Wilder (best known for writing \"Our Town\") to write the screenplay for this film. While the characters don't know the true nature of Uncle Charlie, the audience is tuned in from the start, another Hitchcockian staple that never loses its effectiveness. It is far more frightening to watch someone venture blindly into a situation when the audience knows what lies waiting for them.Joseph Cotten, one of my favorite classic male actors, plays Uncle Charlie with panache and charm, but laced with a sinister fringe which creates a scary persona. Teresa Wright, an actress I have seen in several films, is perfect as young Charlie; her innocence is undercut with a fierce spirit that manifests into survivalism. While the main conflict is between the two Charlies, \"Shadow of a Doubt\" features a great supporting cast, most notably Edna May Wonacott, who plays Charlie's little sister, a bookworm who not only is wise beyond her 10 or so years, but is given some of the funniest lines in the film, as well as Hume Cronyn who plays a neighbor who engages in murder fantasies with Charlie's dad as part of their \"mystery club\".\"Shadow of a Doubt\" is not one of Hitchcock's better-known films like those of his 1950's \u0096 mid-1960's period, but it is one of my personal favorites. Its' sinister theme and truly suspenseful moments combined with great performances make this film a true early Hitchcock classic. 8/10.",

In the idyllic environment and \"unspoiled\" town one (admired) character brings his dark secret. The director has made an almost perfect contrast.Hitch shows us in the very beginning of the film as one of the main characters is something wrong. This is perhaps the main drawback. We stayed poor for normal and superior change in the atmosphere. The entire film runs in a similar vein. The changes are visible, but not exaggerated. The highlight of surprises and tension is again excellent. After that, the atmosphere is a bit tense and depressed. In the second part of the film expressions of morality and solidarity are a bit strange. The world is a terrible place to live, and every now and then someone goes crazy. Given the theme of the movie, my statement can be cynical and justified at the same time.Scenography and acting are as usual at a high level. Teresa Wright as Charlotte \"Charlie\" Newton is the first part of the film victim of her own instincts and emotions, while in the second part of the film victim of the dangerous truth and \"loved\" person. Change in acting is visible and quite good. Joseph Cotten as Charles \"Charlie\" Oakley is a charming uncle, a killer and a scoundrel. It is difficult to simply consider a complex character. Prominent these psycho-physical mysterious moments when the beloved uncle feels threatened. Shadow of a doubt are expressed in both character. In the same moment.

Yet here in Shadow are two of the most impressive turns in the director's legendary canon. Wright's small town girl must go from wide-eyed innocence to suppressed dark suspicion as she suspects more and more about her treasured uncle. As niece Charlie, it's her reactions that must register the movie's deepening suspense. It's an abrupt range that despite the demands remains impressively memorable. A standout Oscar performer, mainly from the 40's, Wright has regrettably slipped into semi-obscurity despite her obvious talent. Never glamorous, she could project a surprising range behind that winning smile, as she does here. On the opposite side is Cotten's Uncle Charlie, registering here a dark dimension along with a sincere handshake. His Uncle Charlie is not all bad. Instead Charlie's small town upbringing has not equipped him for what he sees as a cruel wider world. Thus he's matured into two sides, one a fortune-hunting killer, the other a latent small town citizen. Thus, his return to Santa Rosa is not only an escape but a wish to be reborn into the community womb. In that regard, catch actor Cotten's often fleeting dark moments before his sunny side again surfaces. Nonetheless, his murderous side has already doomed those small town hopes.In a larger sense, Charlie's internal struggle with her uncle has become a struggle for her maturing soul, as she too must face realities of a wider world brought suddenly home to her. In that regard, the movie's impact remains as much a matter of actors as it does of plot, and Hitch's concern for story was never better combined.",

In fact, the most accurate judgment might be one purportedly leveled by author Dashiell Hammett at a Lillian Hellman effort: \"worse than bad, it's ALMOST good.\"  Hitchcock's missteps in this film are legion, from an unnecessary opening sequence in a Philadelphia boarding-house to a silly, equally unnecessary romantic entanglement toward the movie's end.  He lets the film's pace get away from him -- an achievement in itself, given its tendency to plod at awkward moments -- and seems to lose any sense of thematic continuity from scene to scene, sacrificing the occasional strong, telling moment to a mishmash of indifferent editing.Contemporary critics, in extolling \"Shadow,\" seem intent on projecting much of Hitchcock's later greatness onto this film, often seeing things that aren't there.  It's become quite fashionable, for example, to speak of the voluminous dark smoke issuing from the locomotive as it powers the train bringing Uncle Charlie west, seeing this as a \"harbinger\" of evil descending.  One critic has even termed the train as \"phallic\" in its invasion of bucolic Santa Rosa.Nonsense.Sometimes, as Freud once supposedly remarked, a cigar is simply a cigar.  In this instance, the train is simply a train.  Trains of that era happen to have belched dark smoke.  Voluminously.  And Hitchcock happened to like trains.  Used them in a lot of his films.  (And yes, the final train scene in \"North By Northwest\" IS phallic; this one, however, isn't.)\"Shadow of a Doubt\" is, very simply, a film that got away from Hitchcock, one that very likely wouldn't have had he filmed it later in his career. The themes he attempts to explore are worth exploring; unfortunately, he doesn't come close to pulling it off here.  It's really maddening to think just what he might have done, say, a dozen or so years later with this story.But any \"classic\" encomiums attached to this film, sadly, are just so much wishful thinking.",

            "content": "This film begins in Philadelphia with a hunted man--Charles Oakley. In Santa Rosa, we meet his namesake who complains that her family, the Newtons, need something to shake them out of lethargy. Her mother acts as if she were born to slave and wear old clothes; her father talks only of his bank job and money; etc. Into this dysfunctional group comes cultured Uncle Charles. Dimitri Tiomkin's eerie music adds to the proceedings; a psychic connection between Charlie and her Uncle, who is sexually drawn to her, is stressed.. A story by Gordon Macdonnell, Hitchcock, and Alma Reville, his wife was made into a screenplay with contributions from Sally Benson and Thornton Wilder. Hitchcock contrasted the British Empire--within which individuals are actually freer to be eccentric-- with the outwardly freer US, in which they are not. After a reunion recalling older days, Charles doles out presents. After, though Charlie says she wants nothing, he gives her an emerald ring; she talks about knowing that like her, a secretive person, there must be something wonderful inside of him. Charles returns to table and talks about transferring thousands to the local bank. Various sorts of craziness are commented upon. When Charles is given the paper while the father discusses murder with his neighbor, Oakley rip 2 pages out--an article about him; Charlie later spots them folded in his pocket and intuitively tells him they must have been about him. She grabs them and he grasps her wrists, then apologizes as he says they were about something unpleasant. The next day Charlie is running around because the family is going to be interviewed as the 'typical American family\". Charles says count me out and derides the process. He goes with Charlie to the bank and jokes about banks hiding secrets; upbraided by the others, he says, \"all the world's a joke to me.\" On the streetcar, they meet the surveyers; Charles refuses to be included, and Charlie agrees. Her mother bosses the photographer while Charlie and the interviewer get acquainted. Later when a shot is accidentally snapped of Uncle Charles he demands the film. The interviewer, Graham, takes Charlie to a movie. He questions her about her Uncle. He admits he is a police detective; he is seeking a man-- maybe her uncle, maybe not. He appeals to her, because he likes her. if the Uncle is the one, he vows to escort him out of town first. At home, restless, Charlie searches for the missing articles and then rushes to the Library. Dodging traffic and convincing the Librarian to stay open, she tracks down the story--the ring was stolen from the latest victim; her Uncle is the murderer. Avoiding him at table the next night, when she does talk to him, she says she dreamed he was leaving on a train. Later, her Mother reminds him he's to address her club. Charles extemporizes on fat, rich ladies, whom he dislikes. \"They're human beings,\" Charlie reminds him. \"Are they?\" he returns. When Charlie cannot stand the neighbor and her Father talking of poisons, she runs out. Uncle Charles follows and takes her into a wartime club, smoke-filled. He tries to get her to reveal what she has been told; he appeals to her as his \"twin\". She takes off the ring and hands it to him. Protecting himself, he palms the ring and repeats his comments about the women He calls her a sleepwalker, tells her to wake up. Outside he appeals to her; he had been contemplating suicide, and he came here for a refuge from the world. She tells him to go, then at his pleading grants him \"a few days\". Next morning, after church, Graham takes Charlie aside and says his partner got a picture of her uncle after all. She says she's going to get him to leave, before the picture can be checked. Then, with the parents, she's told the Merry Widow killer was killed, in another state--it's on the news. Graham tells Charlie he loves her. The garage door locks them in for a moment before they can get out. Uncle Charles comes out to say goodbye. Later, she nearly falls on the back stair, and wonders if her uncle had prepared it in some way. She confronts him. He is not going away; he's going to settle down. He says the truth would break her Mother's heart; and she no longer has the ring as evidence. He adds, \"I can do a lot for all of you\". She denies it-- a reversal of the beginning attitude she had exhibited. She tells him to go away or she'll kill him herself. That night, the night his lecture to the women's club, he tries to murder Charlie; and from there to the satisfying conclusion on a train, there's no let up in danget, or artistic tying up of loose ends. Cinematography by Joseph Valentine, John Goodman's art direction, set decorations by Russell A. Gausman and the gowns by Adrian and costumes by Vera West are all first-rate. Joseph Cotten is unusually strong; Teresa Wright plays the young woman convincingly. Parents Henry Travers and Patricia Collinge were well-chosen to seem older, ineffectual and vulnerable. Pairing Travers with Hume Cronyn, theneighbor who talks with him about murder, and playing powerful Madcdonald Carey as Chapman assisted by Wallace Ford, another strong choice, were successful castings by my judgment. Among others Grandon Rhodes, Edwin Stanley, Ruth Lee and Minerva Urecal stand out. This is not a great film; it could perhaps have been a great one.",

            "content": "\"It (the world) goes crazy sometimes.\" Jack Graham (Macdonald Carey)Although \"Shadow of a Doubt\" opened at theaters in January of 1943, it was made in 1942, a year in which much of the world had found itself entangled in the horrific violence and uncertainty of a major global conflict, World War II. Considering that the same conflict played such a prominent role in Hitchcock's other films from the same period (Foreign Correspondent, Saboteur, and Lifeboat), I do not believe that the final words of this film are unintentional. In 1942, the world had indeed gone crazy, and Alfred Hitchcock was well aware of its state of insanity at the time. In many respects, the character of \"Uncle\" Charlie Oakley (Joseph Cotten) served as a mere personification of what the world had become. Beyond this, the fundamental viewpoint of Uncle Charlie, that the pleasant appearances of \"normalcy\" in such a world conceal the basic evil that dwells deep within, is a perspective that may very well have been triggered by the brutality and barbarism that World War II had unleashed at the time.Once again, Hitchcock uses his brilliant skill as a film director, to unravel the truth of a specific matter, in this case the true character of Uncle Charlie. The key vehicle of revelation is young Charlie Newton (Teresa Wright), a bright and inquisitive young woman whose innocent adoration for her uncle gradually turns to intense loathing as she slowly discovers the monstrous truth about him.Wright and Cotten are both excellent in the lead roles, and their outstanding performances are augmented by a terrific supporting cast, including Hume Cronyn in his film debut, Henry Travers, Patricia Collinge, Macdonald Carey, Wallace Ford, and even the child actors, Edna May Wonacott and Charles Bates. I credit Mr. Hitchcock, the director, for once again bringing out the very best results from his carefully selected cast. Although Collinge's character of Emma Newton often exasperated me, I believe that's how she was supposed to play her. The fact that Emma could not see or rather chose not to recognize what her young daughter had observed at an early point in the picture was infuriating to me, but all of the other folks in Santa Rosa who glorified a monster were no better than Emma. People can be like that, and there is nothing that any of us can do about it. This reality is as true today as it was in 1942, maybe even worse now.Hitchcock very much valued the locations that he carefully selected for his films, including notable landmarks. In the opening scene, we observe the gray 1942 skyline of Newark, New Jersey, the city of my birth, and the Pulaski Skyway that connects Newark to Jersey City and New York City as it spans the meadow lands that stretch in between. The gritty, gloomy locale of Uncle Charlie's rooming house is in the Ironbound section of Newark. From that shabby, rundown environment, Uncle Charlie arrives in the somewhat idyllic northern California city of Santa Rosa, where the sun always seems to shine and where everyone smiles and says hello. The obvious contrast should not be lost on anyone. Whether perceived or real, Hitchcock's distinction of these two places significantly contributes to the important theme of the contamination of innocence by evil. As a Newark boy, I don't take any of this personally. Why would I?",

            "content": "My twenty-third Alfred Hitchcock film was one that I had been looking forward to for quite a long time, and the Master of Suspense delivered all the thrills and chills I had been expecting. 'Shadow of a Doubt' was the director's sixth film in Hollywood, and his second with Universal Studios. This shadowy, cynical thriller probes within the darkened heart of a typical small American town, revealing a horrifying secret that none of them could ever possibly comprehend. Throughout his career, Hitchcock delighted in creating suspense by recruiting our sympathies for a villain {certain scenes in 'Strangers on a Train (1951),' 'Psycho (1960)' and 'Frenzy (1972)' spring straight to mind}, but here he constructs much of the film around a character we initially believe to be one of the director's \"wrong men.\" Perhaps I was just being influenced by my previous experience with Hitchcock's films, but it wasn't until a long way into the picture that I even contemplated the possibility of Uncle Charlie being a murderous psycho, and Joseph Cotten seems such an amiable fellow that I wouldn't have believed it anyway.'Shadow of a Doubt' explores the duality of good and evil, as personified by the mysterious, almost-telepathic bond between the young and innocent \"Charlie\" Newton (Teresa Wright) and her disturbed uncle Charlie Oakley (Joseph Cotton). After Uncle Charlie {whom we'll call Charles henceforth to avoid confusion} arrives in the Newton family's quaint hometown of Santa Rosa, California, Charlie is absolutely overwhelmed with joy, having shared a special bond with her uncle from a very early age, despite only seeing him on rare occasions. Charles in beloved by all who remember him; his sister Emma (Patricia Collinge) forever cherishes the idealistic childhood memories of her younger brother, and it doesn't take long for the peace-loving townsfolk of Santa Rosa to welcome him as a son. However, there's something sinister about Charles Oakley that nobody could have imagined, as young Charlie, to her dismay, is about to uncover.As well as some thoroughly-gripping suspense, 'Shadow of a Doubt' is also full of the black humour for which Hitchcock was well-known. I particularly enjoyed the playful bantering of Joseph Newton (Henry Travers) and neighbour Herbie Hawkins (Hume Cronyn), as they came together each night to discuss the most efficient means of murdering each other. There's a brilliant irony to be found in the fact that, despite their self-confessed fascination with murder, the two men are simply incapable of recognising a real-life murderer in their midst, dining at their own dinner table no less. The film's climax, though I would have liked for it to be longer, is extremely thrilling, even though we were never expecting our young heroine to be the Merry Widow Murderer's final victim. Another moment I loved, and which I didn't notice the first time I watched the scene, was the director's cameo appearance as a passenger playing bridge on the train. Appropriately in this story, it is Hitch who is holding all the cards, and the characters - as well as the audience! - are merely at his mercy.",

            "content": "I wouldn't exactly label this movie as a film-noir but it's a pretty good '40's thriller, that has a nice concept, which of course gets handled magnificently by the master of suspense; Alfred Hitchcock. It's not his best and also certainly not his most memorable movie but this says something more about the quality of the other movies he has done than about this movie really.Like basically every '40's movie it begins rather slow and it takes its time to set up its story and characters. However about halve way through, when things really start to take off, it becomes a great movie to watch. For '40's standards it's quite an unique little thriller. It knows to build up its tension with a minimum amount of resources.It has a nice story about average people. This is one of the reasons why the thriller elements work out so effectively. The movie isn't set at any strange places, with stereotypical characters. The places, situations and characters are all easy to identify with. The main concept itself is pretty simple but somethings this is all you need for a movie to become a good one. Its screenplay got even nominated for an Oscar.It's a nice shot movie, with some wonderful looking and constructed sequences, once you start paying attention to it. This is were Alfred Hitchcock was great in; creating some solid, unique, great looking sequences, with its original camera-work, in which he could capture a lot of things and emotions and setting the right mood with for the movie.It also features some nice acting. What I like is that the characters are changing throughout the movie. It gives the movie some nice tension since it provides the movie with a certain feeling of insecurity and uncertainty. Especially Joseph Cotten did a great job with this but Teresa Wright is also a nice leading lady.Nice little minimalistic thriller, made great by its concept and of course wonderful and effective directing from Alfred Hitchcock.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "The Newtons are an average suburban American family living in the quiet Californian town of Santa Rosa. Elder daughter Charlie is over the moon when they are paid a surprise visit by her namesake, Uncle Charlie, who brings gifts and excitement, but also a shady and uncomfortable past ...I like this movie, but it's not my favourite Hitchcock film by a rather long chalk. It's extremely well made and the cast are great but whenever I see it, it feels a little flat to me and I'm never quite sure exactly what tone it's going for. The depiction of the small town (it was shot in the real Santa Rosa) and the corruption of young Charlie's innocence are terrific - she starts out bored by the humdrum predictability of her family but by the end she would give anything just to have that back. But as a thriller it has (perhaps intentionally) almost no suspense; we know that Uncle Charlie is a vicious, self-interested sociopath right from the start and we never have any sympathy for him. Wright - the Jodie Foster of her generation - is superb as the girl becoming a woman, forced into facing harsh truths, Collinge is memorable as the self-sacrificing mother who gives all to her family but underneath is dangerously fragile, and there are several excellent vignette performances, notably Cronyn as the meek neighbour. The most interesting thing about Shadow Of A Doubt is that Hitchcock cited it as his favourite of his own films, a comment that intrigues me when he made many other films that were more successful, more ambitious, more original, scarier, funnier, more exciting - take your pick. I think perhaps he meant that from first conception to final cut, this film turned out exactly the way he wanted it to, with nothing lost in the process, more than any other movie he made. It certainly doesn't have any flaws; for me, it's just a bit too much like Santa Rosa - ordinary and respectable. Scripted by Thornton Wilder (the author of Our Town), Sally Benson and Alma Reville (Hitch's wife); catch the director's cameo as the unlucky card-player on the train.",

            "content": "SHADOW OF A DOUBT (1943) (UNIVERSAL) This film is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock picture. From most accounts it's Hitch's favorite, as well. It is very tough to pick a favorite from his fantastic body of work, but this one has always affected me personally. Growing up in a small town, whether it be Santa Rosa, CA., where this film is set or any other small town in North America is an experience that stays with you no matter how far you go away from home, how successful you may become or long you have been away from home. It is a very nostalgic film & a very frightening film, at the same time. Only Hitchcock could have pulled this film off. In lesser hands this would have been just another studio potboiler of the era.This is the story of a serial killer & prodigal son who comes home to sleepy Santa Rosa, to lie low. Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten) is adored by his family, especially his niece Charlotte \"Charlie\" (Teresa Wright). The close bond between these two leads to a delicious cat & mouse game, that eventually pits niece against uncle, good against evil.Hitch's shows that even in small town America, this evil can reside. When Cotten is dressing down his niece, as he realizes that she is on to him, he delivers a cynical monologue ending with \"Do you know if you rip off the fronts of house you'd find swine? The world's a hell. What does it matter what happens in it?\" To this very day that scene makes my skin crawl.The cast is top rate. Joseph Cotten is as good here as he was in \"Citzen Kane\" or \"The 3rd Man\". Beautiful Teresa Wright gives her finest performance, in only her 4th film. She is a very underrated & under-appreciated actress. Hume Cronyn, in his film debut (Herbie Hawkins) & Henry Travers (Charlie's father) give the film the right touch of \"black\" comedy relief, as mystery novel buffs who are constantly trying to come up with the perfect way to kill someone. Macdonald Carey (Detective Jack Graham) & Patricia Collinge (Charlie's mother) are also well cast. Also look for Hitch's cameo, which has him playing cards, on the train to Santa Rosa.Hitchcock's direction keeps the film moving at the right pace & brings you into story, as if you were living in Santa Rosa & watching all of this unravel from your front porch. Thorton Wilder, Sally Benson & Hitch's wife Alma Reville paint the picture with marvelous dialog, adapted from Gordon McDonell's original story. Joseph Valentine's photography on this film is stunning. The contrasting scenes of Uncle Charlie in bed at his flop house hotel & Charlie in bed in her home, drives home the point of good vs. evil, without a word of dialog. This film also began the long partnership of Hitch & legendary composer Dimitri Tiomkin.Rating 10 Stars",

            "content": "WARNING* SPOILERS * WARNING* MANY SPOILERS* Just finished watching \"Shadow of a Doubt\" for the third time, and once again I come away feeling that I just watched a silly film.  First, let's just say right away that Joseph Cotten does a MAGNIFICENT job, although I think Robert Mitchum is much superior in \"Night of the Hunter.\"  Underplayed by Cotten?  Certainly I feel that Mr. Cotten's shift of demeanors is the highlight of the entire experience.  But here are some of my observations on plot holes and general silliness:1) The bank president barely gets ruffled at Uncle Charlie's $40,000 deposit, which is equivalent to maybe $200,000 in today's dollars.  I realize that in those days there weren't drug czars, but organized crime was big business then, and Uncle Charlie's comments that he's just \"in business\" doesn't seem to make a dent in anybody's sensibilities, whereas the mention of the word \"embezzlement\" makes everyone turn and look at Joe.  The deposit is made and seemingly a signature on a scrap of paper is enough \"detail\" for both Charlie and the bankers.  Nobody else seems to care much about Uncle Charlie's riches either, except for another \"merry widow.\"  The detectives on Charlie's trail don't seem to know that Charlie just visited the bank, and if they do, the $40,000 in cash doesn't seem to arouse their suspicions. 2) On the train, at the end, the two little kids are told to \"run along and play.\"  Immediately after that, the train starts moving.  Don't the mother and father have any concern that all three of their children are on this departing train?  Wouldn't Roger and Anne come back to tell Charlie that the train was moving?  The entire scene seems rather contrived.3) Charlie's girlfriends (teenagers, right?) all seem inordinately drawn to much older men (the detectives).  Notice Kathy always coyly eying up Saunders?  And isn't Graham a little OLD for \"little Charlie?\"4) How is it that Uncle Charlie comes into Santa Rosa, virtually unnoticed, appears at the bank with loads of cash and no explanation, and the next thing you know he's giving a speech and is a town HERO?  I know he's charming and a conniver, but how he comes to this is just not satisfactorily explained, and I think is a key element in the film, i.e., how Uncle Charlie is able to survive and get by in a world that he obviously hates.5) The fact that the OTHER suspect(in Maine)gets chopped up by propellors while fleeing does not necessarily clear Uncle Charlie.  In fact, the photo was already, according to Saunders, on its way to be viewed in Massachussetts when the news in Maine broke.  Wouldn't the police in Mass. want to show the photo ANYWAY, just as a matter of course, or of detail? Wouldn't there be ONE person in command who would INSIST that the final detail be worked out?  I mean, OK, the other suspect is chopped up...that doesn't LOGICALLY clear Charlie?  After all, there were no remains to identify the other suspect; why not just \"make sure?\"  Or is the plot element of \"not a very good detective\" more far-reaching than just Graham? Does Hitch think ALL cops are boobs?6) What was the point of the \"hanging sub-plot\" where Charlie's mother was starting to get suspicious of foul play?  Why did that end abruptly? OK, I've made my points. I DID like the movie, though.  I give it 3 stars out of 4 for a number of reasons: it IS suspenseful, well-acted, well-photographed, nicely-paced, and has great humorous moments.It's hard to pick a favorite Hitchcock movie, but right now, mine are North by Northwest, Saboteur, Topaz, The Birds, Psycho, Vertigo, and Frenzy.",

            "content": "'Shadow Of A Doubt (1943)' is certainly not Hitchcock's finest - though he himself considered it his favourite - as it succumbs to a slow pacing and general lull in interest - or specifically tension - due to its mostly nonchalant nature. This unconventionally domestic film-noir thriller still sits comfortably in the iconic director's repertoire as an early example of his ability to eek suspense from a seemingly simple and mundane situation, though, here in the long term. The flick is surprising in the minutia rather than the overall arc - it's pretty obvious from its title and opening where it's going - and the excellent performances sell this kind of unsettling, long-term, intention-turning home-invasion that only really escalates because our protagonist can't let go of the information she's found out, never-mind the fact that she just had to find it out in the first place. Curiosity really did kill the cat in this one and it is interesting that ignorance truly would have been bliss for all the major players here. But once you know, you can't go back and its this central theme that's incredibly interesting, compelling and not all that often explored. Neither is the true tear she feels between family and morality, which is also a gripping and complex problem to grapple with. Indeed, the feature works on many levels and has many levels to it, with some unconventional aspects even coming in the form of what's not there as much as what is, but there's not a full exploration of all of these ideas and some of them are just mere moments. It will pay off more if you're willing to get on-board with the deeper messages and moral quandaries it may present, but is still an engaging and entertaining affair even on its surface. 7/10",

            "content": "...This is Hitchcock at his muscle-flexing best, bringing almost every aspect of his cinematic expertise to conjure a film noir classic which he himself often termed one of his favourite works. The direction is sure and pacey, you feel that Hitch is behind the camera on every shot (no first or second unit lapses are apparent here), deriving maximum effect from his actors and backgrounds. Thus we get camera shots from below, above, off centre (betraying perhaps a Welles-ian influence), forward tracking, backward tracking, long shots, extreme close-ups, together with a panoply of different lighting effects in the best noir tradition. One or two of the narrative devices seem unusual to modern sensibilities, in particular the fact that the Newtons allow the masquerading cops the run of their house for a government survey but there are compensations in snappy dialogue from all concerned, even from the young children and particularly in the director's typical black humour as Newton and his chum, played by Hume Cronyn, forever ghoulishly discuss the perfect murder. Best of all though is the lead acting, with Joseph Cotten as the \"wonder-uncle\" with a (serial) murderous secret and in particular Teresa Wright in a terrific turn as the hero-worshipping adolescent who grows up fast to finally see through Uncle Charlie's charade and attempts, at great personal risk, to effectively exile the serpent from the smalltown Garden of Eden that Cotten has invaded. There are too many excellent what I term directorial flourishes from Hitchcock to recount, just sit back and watch the Master at work. Perhaps the best of his 1940's \"black and white\" work, which considering that list includes \"Notorious\", \"Rebecca\" and \"Foreign Correspondent\" is saying a lot!",

It's a reasonable but slow-moving and rather dull character study, with the only action being the poorly staged finale.

            "content": "Charlie Newton (Teresa Wright) is a bored young woman in a small California town who wishes something exciting would happen. She gets more than she bargained for with a visit from Charlie (Joseph Cotten), her favorite uncle after whom she was named. Her uncle is followed by two detectives who believe him to be the Merry Widow Murderer. Charlie refuses to believe this of her beloved uncle but soon the clues start piling up and she has no choice but to face the truth about him.One of Alfred Hitchcock's best suspense films is a brilliant twist on the kind of wholesome Americana films that were very popular at the time. That Thornton \"Our Town\" Wilder co-wrote the screenplay surely helped. The cast is so good. Teresa Wright has her best and most-remembered role here. Joseph Cotten, a phenomenal actor who could make anything better just by being in it, plays the sinister and disturbed Uncle Charlie perfectly. He has a couple of truly chilling speeches. A lot of scenes for his highlight reel here. Henry Travers and Patricia Collinge are both excellent in subtle ways as the parents. Edna May Wonacott is a lot of fun as the precocious little sister who always seems to have her nose buried in a book. Hume Cronyn makes his film debut as the comic relief neighbor and murder mystery enthusiast. His scenes with Travers are wonderful.I first saw this when I was a teenager and came away disappointed. But, as with many films, I've grown to appreciate it much more as I've gotten older. The main sticking point for me back then was the same as many of the reviewers here -- I felt Uncle Charlie being a murderer was obvious too early and should have been left unclear until the end. I still wonder how much the film would improve, if any, with more ambiguity. This isn't to say the film lacks suspense. It's certainly got that in spades, just not built around the question of Uncle Charlie's guilt. Try to go into it not expecting some big twist and just savor the performances and direction. Hitchcock does an amazing job building the tension, particularly in the final act. It's classic Hitch with some truly memorable lines and scenes. A film that should be on everybody's must-see list.",

            "content": "I wonder what sort of film Shadow of a Doubt might be if Hitchock had cut that opening sequence with Cotten dodging the two agents and whisking away to a safer place. Sure, it does establish his boldness and knack for disappearing right in front of our very eyes (it helps that they do not know what he looks like so he can walk right by them) but it also establishes for a fact that Uncle Charlie is hiding something, and somewhat undermines the slow process of discovery that Charlotte has to go through. Surely the absence of it would make the best scene of the film even better. We overhear Joseph and Herbie musing as they always do, and they mention that the Merry Widow Murderer is dead. Then Cotten climbs the stairs, the slowly and deliberately turns back to give a pointed, menacing look back at Charlie in the sliver of sunlight in the doorstep. The soundtrack climaxes, and in that moment both characters know exactly where the real murderer, and so does the audience. It's a stunning moment of silent tension, mainly because neither can directly admit what they know, and everything else afterwards is merely a formality. The final 'fight' is a little silly now, and the forced romance with Detective Graham seems as though they plucked the nearest available male to give a little comfort for the young Charlie.The two Charlies are certainly a shining light here. Wright does not nearly resemble the teenager she plays (she was in her mid 20s) but by all means is radiant; she has the kind of vivacity and youthful idealism from the get go that Hitchcock ladies aren't often armed with and is the shining light from the start. She rises from the cosy domesticity of the small town as if she were totally aware that there is no other way to kickstart the movie than to get Uncle Charlie into the frame, and then beams constantly at how what a mysterious and imposing character he is. She has the all the imperative here. Opposing her is the sharp- eyed Cotten, who juggles the appearance of a family man rather well, only cracking once to give a frightful monologue. The clash between the leading pair makes the movie a worthwhile study in tension; we can see Hitchcock winking from every scene as Charlie goes closer and closer to discovering the truth, even as she chalks it all up the the excitement of her uncle's enigmatic lifestyle. When she first receives a murdered victim's watch, they key light flashes a little glint in her eye, but it's not yet the moment of discovery - she is merely overjoyed at such a cool present from such a cool uncle. A shake up indeed. What the intro does allow is for all these Hitchock nods at the source of the criminal contrasted with Charlie's initial obliviousness; the way she wonders how they just happen to be the 'average' family chosen for a nation-wide survey, the way Emma shrieks at the visitors to not take pictures of the ugly scenery, and the running dialogue of Joseph and Herbie as crime enthusiasts who endlessly speculate on the perfect murder. First it is a harmless hobby. Later it inserts a grim subtext until Charlie cannot bear it any longer. It's the classical build-up of dramatic irony, and Hitchock subverts his own tendencies; Wright closes the door and leans against it suggestively, and then Cotten grasps her hands roughly as he snatches the newspaper fragment, and for a moment, the pose is like two lovers about to embrace and kiss. But by foregoing that convention dynamic we have something a lot more interesting.",

I was disappointed on every count.  The directing itself has some nice touches, but overall it's a bit ham-handed, as are the performances--especially from the youngest daughter, whose work here is laughably bad (though that's understandable as she was no professional--but couldn't the DIRECTOR have coaxed a better performance out of her?).  My favorite parts were the performances of the young Hume Cronyn, and of Travers.  Cronyn is excellent here, outacting Cotten turn for turn.  Worst of all is the dialogue--unrealistic and exaggerated.  This is a picture very much of its day.  It's worth seeing, to be sure, but it's no masterpiece.",

In typical Hitchcock fashion it unfolds slowly and deliberately, incrementally revealing just enough to keep you watching, while building up to a tense climax.Not among Hitchcock's best though. The build-up is perhaps too slow here. In addition, despite the title, there is not really that much doubt about whether Uncle Charlie is involved in the crimes, so the possibilities with regard to the outcome are limited.

What spoils this for me is that USA were in WW2 when this was made and the \"well to do\" society of that nation, according to 1943 Hitchcock were enjoying themselves as though there wasn't anything happening in the outside world. The ending is quite disappointing and the \"mother\" is one of those very annoying types, her younger daughter a bookworm, the \"nosey neighbour\" is a male who talks about the perfect murder, then theres Theresa Wright who despite being asked to keep a secret clearly isn't very good at it.

            "content": "An average family in Santa Rosa, California, being encroached by a man of vice in this intriguing Hitchcock thriller, a young teenager Charlotte Newton (Wright), aka. Charlie, grumbles about her family's stuck-in-inertia status quo: her father Joseph (Travers) is an ordinary bank clerk, who is only fond of prattling about morbid murder strategy with their neighbor Herbie (Cronyn in his film debut); her mother Emma (Collinge), a tireless housewife who has three children to attend to, Charlie, Ann (Wonacott, a bespectacled bookish kid) and Roger (Bates), the youngest boy.So Charlie is expectant a miracle to happen, to at least bring some excitement, that's when her namesake uncle Charlie (Cotten) from her mother side, announces his visit from New York, where the picture's noir-ish prelude ominously manifests that uncle Charlie is on the run from some unspecified party. Though Charlie claims her intrinsic affinity towards her uncle, gets all hyped-up by an improbable telepathy between them (well, it is just a sheer coincidence), to viewers, her desperation of seizing anything can break the ennui patently overwhelms their real emotional bond. However the plot doesn't pad out their past stories since the narrative steers directly to that suspicion-arousing development right after the first family dinner after uncle Charlie's arrival, his gift to niece Charlie is a ring engraved with other person's initials, a way-too-obvious act of hiding a newspaper article doesn't make much sense in the first place, but the tension has been aptly built, so we are all absorbed to see how young Charlie will step by step edge near the dark secret, which will entirely shatter the shallow idolatry for her worldly uncle and perniciously subject her to consecutive murderous attempts.That is a typical Hitchcockian premise, the fuse is ignited, let's all wait for the explosion with bated breath. But what jars this is the unfortunately outdated persona of our heroine (it is made in 1943, time changes, so is the ethos), young Charlie is an innocuous gal, safely protected from the adult seediness penetrating the society by provinciality and her \"average\" upbringing, which indeed ricochet to dampen her spirit. During her rude awakening, Charlie is never proactive to be gauged as smart, or intrepid enough to match her rival, the only reason she can narrowly survive all the deathtraps is just because she cannot die, she is the protagonist, a symbol of innocence and purity, which prompts Hitchcock to really jump the shark in the rash ending to dispatch the villain. Throughout the whole process, Charlie hardly does anything effectively admirable, hobbled by her own sentimentality, she has the key evidence in her hand, but it never occurs to her that a sensible act is to give it to the detective Jack Graham (Carey), who is unmistakably besotted with her, even when she is completely convinced that uncle Charlie is a wrongdoer at large.Nevertheless, viewers can tell, Hitchcock is more resolute in pinpointing uncle Charlie's sociopathic reckoning, especially his misogynous rant during the dinner, which is plain execrable, what makes him a more deserving recipient of the fortune than those rich widows? It certainly hurts when no one dares to refute back, it is a missed opportunity for Charlie to speak volumes for herself, pitifully it is not in Hitchcock and co's minds. Moreover, a big chunk of the information about uncle Charlie's crime has been decidedly undisclosed, what is the deal with another suspect? And since the detectives have a picture of uncle Charlie, what happens to the assuming witness who could identify the perpetrator? These blank bullets leave the film a bit less compact as a top-tier Hitchcock production, albeit the sporadically scintillating lustre (magnificent chiaroscuro galore) manufactured by the technique department.",

Everyone else is up in arms about Charles staying with the family, possibly for good, apart from Young Charlie who suspects Uncle Charlie (the two names being the same is intriguing) of being a \"Widow Murderer\", and she's right, it's obvious when he yells about looking at the newspaper, to read a story about him.

They had children sometimes a little later in life as seen here with the large age gap between Charlie and her two siblings. Refreshing look back on a really ideal life, that is until little Charlie discovers the deep dark secrets of her favorite uncle. There is a sinister feel to the film, abundant with dark shadows and black and white photography. The comic relief comes between the father and his best friend taking great joy in figuring out how to murder each other. Of course only theoretically.

Well, i geared myself up to watch one of the most praised thriller of 40s and then i witnessed a family film for the first 50 minutes. Then the twists come that a niece suspect something and she is told by Private Detective who fell in love with her by just spending 3 hours as a part of his job, that her uncle might be a murderer they are looking out for. She already suspected something and now almost proved it to herself and her uncle that yes he's a murder and that's just halfway through the film when all the suspense is over and then loophole arrives. He gets away but still she continues suspecting him. And at last there is an Accident. What kind of thriller it was? Didn't make any sense at all especially when you have weapon called Fictional writing to create real thrill and suspense. May be it is because of the era in which i am watching the film then i guess 40s audience and critics were not smart enough. That's so rude of me. Anyways, Shadow of a Doubt is more a family drama than a thriller if i have to sum up it in one sentence. Hitchcock has done much better than this i have almost finished with his 95% classics therefore a mediocre attempt like this was never meant to thrill me. As expected, it didn't thrill me nor i got anything to admire here. Still i gotto talk little bit about writing, see there were so many loopholes to be covered in this simple written story. Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten did good. Supporting cast, Cinematography, screenplay were Decent but unexpectedly film was not dark. I mean it was so light hearted film throughout which is not expected from Hitchcock. I had problems with the conviction of final draft that they didn't really keep anything that can be called a real growing suspense. Leave it, i don't really see any potential in a family story when it is being made in Thriller genre. These 2 are oppositions and you can't fit them in same team. One of those overrated (considering critics rating), soul-less and pointless drama which cannot be recommended.RATING - 6/10*",

            "content": "Alfred Hitchcock is considered by many to be a master of suspense and mystery. But this film has little mystery. The whole story revolves around a middle class family who is visited by a mysterious uncle. The visit makes everyone excited, especially his niece, Charlie. The reasons why she is so happy and wants his visit so bad are unclear, and the film seems to suggest that she felt a kind of teenage crush on the man, mature and mysterious, staying at the family home. The fact is that she quickly realizes that there is something wrong with him and that he seems to be hiding something very bad. After investigating, she learns that the authorities are looking for a murderer and immediately suspects him.The biggest problem with this film is revealing the truth about what is going on too soon. This happens about halfway through, and makes the rest of the film obvious. The film tries to create an atmosphere of mystery around that uncle, and it succeeds very well, but so much flattery around him by the family is something that sounds strange and unreasonable. The rest is quite banal and ordinary.The cast is headed by Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten. I don't know what they had in mind or if it was a clear indication from the director, but whenever they act together they look like a dysfunctional couple, not an uncle and his niece. She clearly seems enchanted with him, and the film unfolds the idea I have that Wright's character was in love, as it is the only logical justification for the character's attitudes and silence after discovering his uncle's secret. The rest of the cast simply do what they need to do.Technically, the film seems to be quite common, within the so-called film noir. I especially liked some parts, like a scene shot from the top, when Uncle Charlie is chased by policemen and they lose sight of him. The ending is also very good.",

On an overall scale, Shadow of a Doubt remains one of the finest achievements in cinema that's as effective today as it was 70 years ago & isn't Hitchcock's personal favourite from his glorious filmography for nothing.A defining classic in every sense of the word, an influential example of its genre & a must for every cinema lover out there, Shadow of a Doubt comes highly recommended.",

            "content": "This is a Hitchcock movie that still works very well today. Joseph Cotten is remarkably passive in the opening, something that stays with him till he sees his niece, Charlotte \"Charlie\" Newton, played by Teresa Wright. The movie belongs to those two. Macdonald Carey was so young I didn't recognize him playing Charlotte's love interest, and this is Hume Cronyn's first screen appearance. Patricia Collinge is great as Charlotte's mother (Emma Oakley Newton), the sister of the sinister Charles Oakley (Cotten). Charlotte is named after her mother's brother, and there are jokes throughout that the two are twins, telepathically connected.We know that something's wrong with Charles Oakley from the beginning, but we haven't a clue what it is. When he arrives at sunny Santa Rosa, California, on the steam train, we get to my favorite scene. I have no idea how Hitchcock pulled it off. The train steams into the station trailing a black cloud of exhaust which covers the sky and casts a dark shadow over the whole scene - Charles is here. It's like \"MacBeth\" when the witches say, \"Something wicked this way comes.\"Cotten is great as Uncle Charlie. Smooth, affable, courteous when it pays for him. I got more out of watching him with his back to the camera than most actors give me when they face the camera. Cotten knew how to sell Charlie to me just by how he stood and walked. You know Charlie is a very dangerous sociopath without ever knowing why you know it or what the danger really is. Collinge's Emma is beautiful as the loving, gracious sister with no clue what her little brother has become.Teresa Wright plays the main character, the hero. This is not a typical Hitchcock movie where the hero is a good guy trapped in a bad man's clothes from which he must extricate himself and convince the cops he didn't do it. Charlotte is a good girl leaving no doubt about her goodness. The issue is coming to grips with the evil Charlie brings into their home. Wright is great as we see her spiral from joy to despair as Charlie's nature begins to expose itself. The conflict is how to protect Emma from knowing the real Charlie.Thornton Wilder contributed to the screenplay, and the beginning when we see Charlotte and her family is pure Wilder - families are supposed to be happy, they talk, they are all adults (even the 9-year-old). But as Charlie works his way on the Newtons, things get dark. \"Our Town\" goes sour as death becomes all too real. Charlie takes Charlotte where she's never been before. It's a place where no small-town girl before World War II needs to go, a place she shouldn't even know exists. Sally Benson was co-screenwriter for this movie. She may be best known for her short stories of growing up in St. Louis, which were made into \"Meet Me in St. Louis,\" directed by Vincent Minnelli and starring Judy Garland (although Benson did the screenplay for \"Viva Las Vegas,\" too.) How you get from happy, frothy musicals to foreboding Santa Ana is a mystery.Alma Reville also gets screenwriter credit. She was Hitchcock's wife, so I'm guessing where the darkness came from. Mystery solved. Nothing like being married to Alfred Hitchcock to bring out the darkness in one's soul.And Hitchcock knew his way around a set with a camera. He used the sets here with his usual greatness, giving us shots of Charlie and Charlotte that emphasized their dynamic relationship. Good and evil was black and white in those days, and although we're offered an excuse for Charlie's sociopathy it doesn't really hold water. Hitchcock doesn't really care how Charlie got that way; the issue here is Charlie and Charlotte. The tension is from Charlotte's journey of discovery, not Charlie's. And the sexual tension between them is palpable though never explicit.It's a movie that still grips the viewer. Teresa Wright was good as Charlotte, and Joseph Cotten was superb as Uncle Charlie.",

The humming of this tune at the extended family dinner table constitutes the proverbial plot hole large enough for a semi-truck's entrance. Someone such as poet Alan Ginsberg (or was it the poison-witted Dorothy Parker?) once recommended that story tellers \"kill their darlings\" or pet ideas that clutter what might otherwise be a workable tale. This movie is one of the best examples from the body of human culture that illustrates what can happen when an artist stubbornly refuses to kill his darling (in this case, the \"merry widow\" motif). It's no surprise to the knowledgeable that Hitch always named SHADOW OF A DOUBT as his favorite film among his own 50-plus offerings, as it is one of his most misogynistic, trimmed with sprigs of incest overtones. After SHADOW OF A DOUBT, the viewer can see how there was no place left for him to go other than the psychotic extremes of VERTIGO, PSYCHO, and MARNIE!",

            "review_title": "What Lies Beneath",
            "content": "Shadow Of a Doubt is Hitchcock's favorite of his more than fifty films. Many find this puzzling, since it's rather cool, light and detached, and has few really suspenseful set-pieces till near the end. The setting is prosaic,--a small California town in wartime--and though Hitch didn't generally go for thunderstorms and castles, he tended to set his films in glamorous, cosmopolitan locales, while this one is extremely bland. One half-expects Andy Hardy to turn up in his jalopy. It takes several viewings of this subtle, complex film to understand why Hitchcock chose to make it the way he did, and where he did. In the end, I'm inclined to agree with the director in so far as while this may not be my favorite Hitchcock, I can think of none better.The story revolves around an outwardly normal middle class American family whose eldest daughter, Charlie, is the most intelligent and imaginative member. She can hardly wait till her handsome, mysterious uncle, also named Charlie, will arrive for a visit. Uncle Charlie proves to be a charming, sophisticated fellow, and if not quite the knight in shining armor his niece imagined him to be, he manages to make a pretty big noise with his relatives and various of their friends. As things turn out, some lawmen are on the lookout for a fugitive psychopath known as \"the merry widow murderer\", who seduces and then kills wealthy women for their money and jewels. Since uncle Charlie happens to match certain of their criteria for this criminal, niece Charlie grows understandably suspicious. At first, niece Charlie regards the notion of her uncle as a murderer as ludicrous. Then uncle Charlie begins to drop hints that he may be not be quite so nice a fellow as he seems.  There's no one for niece Charlie to turn to. Her father is distracted by fantasies of, oddly enough, murder, as he and neighbor Herbie read murder mysteries constantly, and dream of ever more efficient ways of killing someone; while her mother, Charlie's sister, is nervous and not, well, not a hundred percent. Patricia Collinge plays the part brilliantly, using her voice in such a way as to suggest someone in whom years of affectation have become normal, and who yet still cannot comfortably be herself. Niece Charlie's suspicions about her beloved uncle increase. She comes to understand, as we all must, that things are not as they appear. In such circumstances there's really no one to turn to but oneself. Most people are too self-absorbed to care, or are not interested in the finer points of psychology and behavior. What makes this all the more disturbing is that the people one loves the most are often the least reliable in their insights because they're so loving; when it comes to getting at the truth, any truth, one often has to go it on one's own. In a strange way, Shadow Of a Doubt is a coming of age tale masquerading as a murder mystery. It's that, too, and grandly entertaining, but Hitch and author Thornton Wilder seem to be probing deeper, into what it's like to become and be an adult, and how difficult this is in a world that cares only for appearances and impressions. In this regard, the movie is also a satire of the middle classes, with their hidden morbid traits and nervous afflictions no one wants to talk about. That the film came out in wartime gives it an added resonance. America was shielded from the war by two oceans, and though there were homefront hardships, they were minor when compared to the suffering in Europe and Asia. Yet for all this, we were never so safe as we imagined. Crimes were still committed; the darkness and complexity of humanity didn't vanish just because there was a war on. There are murderers here, in our very midst, Hitchcock and Wilder are telling us. Some of them might even be mass murderers, in a manner of speaking. They might even be members of our family.",

            "content": "\"Shadow of a Doubt\" (1943), the story of a serial murderer as a loving uncle is the movie which Hitchcock himself had declared as his favorite. This movie is quite a departure from Hitchcock's previous Hollywood productions. For the first half, it is an intimate family dramedy that describes a typical American family in a typical small town, USA which in this film is called Santa Rosa, CA. Hitch said about the movie, \"I am extremely anxious to avoid the conventional small-town American scene and the stock figures that have been seen in so many films.\" Much of the film was shot on location in a real California small town far away from the studio. The director worked closely with the famous writer Thornton Wilder on the screen (Oscar nomination) about a charming attractive young man (Joseph Cotten) who after many years comes to Santa Rosa to visit with the family of his older sister whom he truly loved. He brings into the lives of his relatives, especially his older niece and namesake Charlie (Teresa Wright) excitement and joy. Soon things begin look puzzling and even grim when two undercover detectives from a big city on the East Coast show up in Santa Rosa and reveal to Charlie who by the words of her father, \"has brains\" and the power of observation that her beloved uncle Charlie may be an infamous \"Merry Widows murderer\" on the run. The girl does not want to believe the detectives but she can't help noticing her uncle's strange behavior, his sudden and scary mood changes. The inscription on a gorgeous emerald ring he gave her as a gift makes her think of a previous owner of the pricey jewelry. She grows increasingly suspicious of the uncle who loves his niece but he loves his freedom much, much more...Unbearable tension builds up, leading to the series of accidents and to hair-raising climax in the best traditions of Hitchcock's movies.8.5/10",

I found myself liking it, even though I can't give any particular reasons why. In fact, I found it to be meandering and a little unfocused, at times. Yet it still left me with a positive impression. It had a different feel from any of the other Hitchcock movies that I've seen. There's little mystery to it, and the thrills and suspense are of a different kind than those that were offered in North by Northwest or Notorious. I'd struggle to compare this to any of his other movies. Yet, the director felt that it was his favorite. I can't deny that I found the relationship between Charlie and her uncle to be interesting, in all its phases. And since so much of the plot hinges on that, then perhaps that explains some of Shadow of a Doubt's likability. \u00a0\u00a0I'd say that if you're a fan of Hitchcock, give this film about family menace in Santa Rosa a try. It's a bit of an odd duck, yet it was entertaining, nonetheless. I put it firmly in the middle of the pack of Hitchcock's movies.",

In this tale, Hitchcock tells the story of the Newton family and the tragic secret that is hidden from them. Charles Spencer (Joseph Cotten in a chilling, but grand performance) is a man who is suspected of being a strangler known as the Merry Widow Murderer. To hide from authorities, he decides to visit his sister and her family in Santa Rosa. His niece, Charlotte or 'Charlie' (Theresa Wright, Oscar winner from 'Mrs. Miniver') is delighted to see him, but soon grows suspicious of her beloved uncle. This film is a great tale of terror and suspenseful moments, bu the fact that we know who the murderer is ruins some of the plot.

There are curious writing credits as well if anyone asks you. Mrs Hitchcock, natch, gets equal credit under her maiden name, Alma Reville - possibly where Bryan Forbes learned about nepotism - but it is the pairing of intellectual Thornton Wilder and New Yorker regular Sally Benson that intrigues, though whilst we COULD have had an amalgam of The Bridge of St Louis Rey and Meet Me In St Louis we have to settle for something far more pedestrian, our old friend the 'mysterious' stranger who may or may not be hiding a guilty secret. Joseph Cotton is a fine actor, exceptional when working with a real 'master' like Orson Welles rather than a faux imitation clad in the King's new clothes, and together with Teresa Wright he invests the film with what appeal it has.

            "content": "The simple, yet very suspenseful story of a man suspected of being a serial killer coming to visit his sister and his family in a small, quintessential American town is one that despite the enormous freedom allowed today, many directors would probably pass on. Perhaps this is due to the fact that no one could make it as intense or thrilling as the Master of Suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock.After a string of successes in Hollywood, including the Oscar-winning Rebecca, Suspicion, and Saboteur, Hitchcock really began to branch out and make projects that I believe foreshadow the imminent success he would have in the 1950s. While this may not have been one of his most successful or memorable films, it is in my mind the first one dealing with a rather grim subject, more so than his previous films, and it also shows his immense talent in setting up the audience for a devastating climax. Here, Hitchcock had a tremendous cast to work with as well as being able to shoot on-site in a small suburban California town.Teresa Wright gives a quirky and solid performance as the oldest daughter and the most idealistic, named Charlie after her uncle Charlie, the suspected murderer played so brilliantly by one of the most underrated actors of all time, Joseph Cotten. Cotten, best known for working with Orson Welles, completely changes his on-screen persona and creates a very disturbing and memorable character. There are some deftly touches from Hitchcock that show the special bond these two have and has Charlie's suspicions rise about her uncle, we can see that connection manifest itself even more. My one tiny complaint is that of the detective character who seemingly falls in love with the young Charlie, which to me didn't fit the tone or realism of the story.In short, this is one of Hitchcock's very best, on par with his run of masterpieces in the late 1950s. He uses the great cast and writing and traps us in the story with the characters in this innocent little town that has to deal with a very big presence that is overshadowing them all. And all the young Charlie needs to suspect her uncle is a shadow of a doubt.",

I don't mean that his villain was spontaneous also, because it was, but I rather watch Joseph Cotton slip into any actor he chooses. He does this with perfection, you know; I seriously doubt Hitch had to direct him on how to portray his character, because Joseph knew what he was doing(and if you don't believe me just check out the movie Niagra and see for yourself). He made this film and for a thousand reasons and I'll explain.One: Joseph Cotton knows how to make his character talk in this movie, his voice is the doom of whats to become, you get a first glimpse of this in the first opening two minutes of this movie. You know that even the poor little maid or whoever that was , she was tense, alert, and very frightened of his presence and I always wondered if she wasn't also suspicious about him herself...which makes two shadow of doubts, if that is the case. But his voice always made me afraid, especially the tones and the changes...he was meticulous with this!!! 2. Oh you know it, the walk, the posture, the custom in which he has to address his character. I seen people try to imitate this walk in movies for a long time, George Clooney could almost do it(Oceans Eleven, Out Of Sight), but you cant compare with Cotton, he has his own creative upbringing with this and only him belongs in this category. But in the scene where he grabs the newspaper from Young Charlies hand and tells her that is none of your business....I have to say this movie was made in 1943, but I was chilled and glued to my seat...it took me a glass of vodka and a pretzel to make me start moving again.3. His eyes, you don't see many movie stars with Joseph Cotton eyes. His stare, his knowledge...he knows, he knew and he wants to learn more, thats what it all says. I knew that he knew what Young Charlie was up to before it all started unraveling. The newspapers, the detectives disguising as photographers. In Joseph Cottons eyes you see the answers and his knowledge of all this already in his subconscious, a lot of actors cannot present this to you....well , OK maybe Anthony Hopkins in Nixon, even Stone said he was very deceiving on how he used his eyes. Creepy!!! 4. Joseph Cotton is the mastermind of being a little Jezebel...if he was a woman he be right up there with Joan and Betty themselves, probably outdo them and keep going forward , not looking back. At the scene of the dinner table was another point of how genuine Cotton can be. His dark, monotone voice sings to me with how cynical he views women, and oh I could see Joseph Cotton right there through those brilliant eyes murdering all his victims, and his lips moving and telling his opinion how dirty they are, how trashy, how thoughtful Joseph, maybe you should come over to my house and meet my mother....she would absolutely despise you!!! As for Alfred Hitchcock, well , how can you go wrong. The first scene, leading towards the last scene, with the dancers jumping in between sequences to remind us, where this guy has been and what he had done. Teresa Wright wasn't too bad, there were scenes I thought she maybe bit her tongue on and wish she could do over, but how can you with Hitchcock? If he thought it was alright, it was alright! I thought the ending was rushed, I wanted more appeal and suspense before it ended, but thats OK too , because I knew he wasn't going to board the train and leave out of sight again. Joseph Cotton personally probably would've wanted Hitchcock to let him go, be free and always being that lingering poisonous uncle Charlie in the back of Young Charlies fragile, naive, little mind, contaminating and absorbing her thoughts and playing with her mentally without being there in his lively presence.For my favorite scene , it definitely has to be the one where Joseph Cotton(I'm sorry, this is one of my favorite actors, I cant refer him to Charlie unless I get off track) is walking up the stairs after , well you'll find out, but he turns around and see's his Shadow Of Doubt right there in front of the door...at that moment , he knew, love , relative, whatever, he had to get rid of her and fast, but the scene was done so meticulously by Hitchcock that without any suspense to it at all, it literally gave me a ball of fear rolling around inside me.You guessed it......10/10!!!",

Soon, their seemingly perfect relationship is shattered by a shadow of a doubt: Good ol' Uncle CHalrie may be the wanted Merry Widow Murderer.Regarded by the Master himself as his personal favorite among his works, SHADOW OF A DOUBT is one of Hitchcock's best works. With his emphasis on suspense rather than surprise, the story is not really about Charlie finding out who her uncle really is. In fact, if it won't take you halfway throughout the movie without knowing who Charles really is. But Hitch doesn't aim for surprise; to shock us with a twist ending that might come of as implausible if not obvious. Instead, he focuses on his characters and the tension brimming between them. If Charlie knew of her uncle's identity, what would she feel? And how far will Charles go to keep his identity hidden? Will he risk killing his favorite niece (not to mention the daughter of his only sister)? There's so much tension going on that in fact, it's the ending (not the climax) that comes of as the weakest point (Once again, Hitch leaves a number of things open for debate and curiosity that comes off a little frustrating).But despite just that little quibble (after all, it's a pretty common Hitch trait that I've learned to live with), SHADOW OF A DOUBT is an expertly-crafted and intriguing thriller, held together by strong performances and Hitch's touches of suspense and dark humor. Not his best ever, but up there in his Top 10.Rating: ***** out of 5.",

Unlike a lot of films from the era the pacing still holds up very well, with the suspense bubbling along nicely throughout leading to an exciting intense final chapter. The way in which the uncle (Joseph Cotten) smoothly operates means that it never becomes hard to believe in the events that unfold, and in the manner in which they do. This is one of the somewhat few films ever made that is unmissable for all true cinema fans, and an everlasting treat for all time.",

            "content": "I was definitely hyped for this movie when I first saw it, if only because it was a young Joseph Cotten in a Hitchcock movie.  This was a very enjoyable movie, but I have to agree that this is definitely NOT Hitchcock's best; with Psycho, Vertigo, and Spellbound easily beating it out.Of course, I can't blame either Hitchcock or Cotten for this disappointment. In 1943 when this movie was made, Hitchcock had just moved to Hollywood from England and had to deal with big time movie producers, the most notable being David Selznick.  Selznick thought he knew how to make a movie, and pressured Hitchcock to make cookie-cutter movies that would make big bucks at the box office.  Hitchcock and Selznick continually fought about what should be a good movie.  The two were like oil and water--they didn't mix, and neither does this Hitchcock production.  Although Jack Skirball does get credit with the production, it's either in the opening or endings credits where you can see the words \"a David O. Selznick production,\" a good indicator that Selznick was involved somehow.  It's only after Hitchcock is released from Selznick's grasp that you see some of his truly great movies like Psycho, Rear Window, North by Northwest, Dial M for Murder, and Vertigo.So there's the history lesson why Shadow of a Doubt is not as good as other Hitchcocks.  But that's not to detract from some of the ingenious parts of the movie.  Thorton Wilder's writing is accurate of how a large family converses: by continually overlapping and interrupting each other. (or maybe it was Hitchcock's idea, either way it was great!) And, of course, the greatest part of it all, Henry Travers, the angel from It's a Wonderful Life, and a very young Hume Cronyn discussing how to kill each other!  What a great idea! I doubt very much if Selznick could have thought of that. All in all a very enjoyable movie.",

Soon it gets worse as his favourite niece also named Charlie, slowly realizes that he is wanted for murder and may possibly be the notorious \"Merry Widow Killer.\" Now the acting is superb with Theresa Wright who plays the niece young Charlie is really a gem and holds her own throughout the flick. The film provides subtle cues that build until Charlie suspects her beloved Uncle Charlie is a murderer and even tries to kill her, not once but several times. But the movie as a whole is strange and weird like we have the uncle who acts suspicious and vicious like a criminal, especially when he speaks how bad the world is along with how wicked divorced women and widowed women are. Yet nobody is smart enough to pick up on this. Another strange aspect is how Charlie's father and his friend pass the time by talking about the perfect murder...weird. And the romance between the detective and young Charley felt rushed and like what the?!? Anyways, not the worst but definitely not the best Hitch flicks, 5.4/10.",

It was a pleasant surprise. The film is interesting from the get-go, and is never really boring. The idea is very good, and the execution is great. The plot is excellent. The acting is great, particularly Joseph Cotten as Uncle Frank. The writing is excellent, very real and natural, particularly the two young children. I believed the characters, they felt real. As most of Hitchcock's films, I found this to be completely psychologically accurate. Like all of Hitchcock's films, it contains a good bit of suspense. One scene near the end nearly had me in hysterics with how intense it was. Hitchcock builds the mystery and lets it unfold in a manner similar to several of his other films. Though the ending felt somewhat abrupt and unsatisfying, this is still one of Hitchcock's best, in my opinion. A thoroughly great Hitchcock, worth watching for anyone who enjoys his films. I recommend this to fans of Hitchcock, thrillers in general and film noir. 8/10",

The film would be seriously perfect if it was around 1 Hour and 20 minutes instead of almost 2 hours long (lots of things in the last half could have been cut down) The dialogue was great as well, most from what \"Uncle Charlie\" has to say. One other final thing I would like to say is that the CAMERA WORK is PHENOMENAL, there are tons of interesting shots and they all feel like a lot of thought was put into each angle and shot, editing was great, and you really get a sense of what it was like back in those days.This is definitely in Hitchcock's top 10 films IMO, but films like Vertigo, Psycho, Rear Window, Dial M For Murder are all better than this one for sure",

            "content": "The weakest part of this movie is the part that involves the detectives. Nothing really seems to make sense. They want a picture of Charlie Oakley so they can show it to witnesses to see if he is the Merry Widow serial killer. All they need to do is bring him in for questioning and take his picture. Failing that, they could have photographed him when he walked right toward them at the beginning of the movie. After he walks past them, they follow him. What for? Do they think that by following him, they will catch him in the act of killing another widow? I could go on, but what would be the point? Suffice it to say that everything involving these detectives is unrealistic. And it is a shame, because with a few changes in the script, they could have been left out entirely.It is the rest of the movie, the parts where the detectives play no significant role, that the movie really engages us. When the movie begins, it is clear that Charlie Oakley has just killed another widow, after first getting his hands on her money. But it is not the money he cares about. He hates these women and it gives him great satisfaction to kill them. But now, thoroughly sated from his recent murder, he is weary, listlessly lying in bed, with some of the money carelessly allowed to fall on the floor. He finally decides to visit his sister and sends her a telegram.Meanwhile, his niece, young Charlie, is first seen lying supine in bed in a way that matches her uncle when we first saw him, giving us just a hint of incest. Her fascination with her uncle is just a little unsettling in this regard. They both have the same name, and she is convinced that they are just alike. At first, she too is listless, just as her uncle was, but she suddenly decides to send him a telegram, inviting him to visit them, right after he has sent her mother a telegram saying that he is coming.When her uncle arrives, he gives her a ring, which has an engraving on the inside, \"T.S. from B.M.\" Later, Charlie reads in the paper that the initials of the deceased husband of a recently murdered widow were \"B.M.\" Both \"T.S\" and \"B.M.\" are well known abbreviations for fecal matter, which is a way of suggesting something foul associated with the beautiful emerald ring. The evil hidden underneath beauty is the theme of this movie.In a similar way, the town where young Charlie lives is one of those warm, wholesome towns, representing the goodness of America, and good-looking Uncle Charlie is the evil hidden within that town. But that is not the most disturbing example of this theme. We find such evil in young Charlie herself. As the movie keeps emphasizing, and as she keeps insisting, she and her Uncle Charlie are very much alike. And that means that she has her dark side too. Because young Charlie is played by Teresa Wright, a wholesome looking young woman, rather than an actress whom we might see playing a femme fatale in a film noir, the contrast between her innocent appearance and the evil within her is stark.When she figures out that her uncle is the Merry Widow murderer, she does not turn the ring over to the police and tell them what she knows. Instead, she merely insists that he leave town, so that her mother will not be hurt by the knowledge of what her brother really is. And she does this even when she knows who his next victim will be, a widow he meets in town, and who will be leaving on the same train. This makes her an accomplice to his next and subsequent murders.In another scene, she tells him that she wants to kill him. And so she does. The scene in which she pushes her uncle into the path of the oncoming train can be understood as merely the accidental result of her effort to get away from him, and it would have been an act of self-defense in any event. But what happens matches what she says she wanted to do. Of course, there is no way her dark side is anything like that of her uncle, the main difference being that her uncle had a head injury when he was young, which allowed his dark side to flourish. But the evil in her is there nevertheless. And so, the movie seems to say, in all of us.",

Charlie is well liked by his sister's daughter, Charlie Newton, (Teresa Wright) who thinks the world of her uncle Charlie.

However, I rewatched it for the first time in years the other day on DVD, and I must say that I was hugely impressed by it. It could well tie with 'Lifeboat' as Hitchcock's most underrated movie. It's such an interesting film, and difficult to categorize. While there are moments of suspense I wouldn't really describe it as a thriller. Film-noir is a bit off, and just plain drama doesn't give you much idea of what you're in for. However you want to label it it's a brilliant piece of work, with a strong script from Thornton Wilder, and an excellent cast. I know nothing about Teresa Wright, but she is very good as Young Charlie, and the scenes between Henry Travers ('It's A Wonderful Life'), who plays her father, and his crime buff buddy Hume Cronyn (in his film debut) are priceless, but of course, Joseph Cotton as the charming but deadly Uncle Charlie steals the movie with a superb performance. Cotton worked with everyone from Orson Welles to Mario Bava in his long career, but I would say this is my favourite role of his, even beating his Holly Martins in the dazzling 'The Third Man'. 'Shadow Of A Doubt' gets better and better with every viewing. I think it's close to being a masterpiece. Highly recommended!",

            "content": "Tonight was perhaps my 4th time seeing this film, but the first time in many years. I remembered mixed feelings about it and tonight's viewing confirmed those thoughts.A man travels across the U.S. to have a prolonged visit with his sister and her family-husband, adult daughter, and two children. Now there was a confusing introductory scene where he was lying on a bed with a cigar in his hand-fully dressed, mind you, when his landlady at the boarding house comes to tell him two men wanted to see him but she lied and said he wasn't there. His room is littered with scattered money-bills of various denominations that the landlady picks up for him.When she leaves, he seems to ponder a bit, then he scoops up the money and leaves. Even though he has seen those men standing on the corner, apparently waiting for him, he goes out the front door and quietly walks right past them as they pretend not to care about him at all.Then they follow him and he eludes them, and is next seen on a train that takes him to California, where he has wired the family about his visit. This delights all of them, particularly his favorite niece, played by Teresa Wright, named Charlie-just like her uncle.Shortly thereafter, two men come saying they want to take a survey of the people in the house, including photos. Uncle Charlie enlists his niece to keep him out of it, and when they appear to accidentally snap a photo that includes him, he demands the roll of film because he doesn't like to have his picture taken.Talking on a date with one of the two men-sort of an unofficial date while she was showing him the town-Charlie figures out the \"survey\" is a ruse and he admits he is a detective and his quarry, her uncle, may be a serial killer.Trying to track down a newspaper article her uncle destroyed while showing her young siblings a \"trick\" Charlie dashes to the library arriving at 9 p.m. just after they closed, but the librarian lets her in for \"three minutes\" and then disappears. Charlie finds the paper in question and learns the article is about the Merry Widow Murderer, complete with a bit about his latest victim. This causes her to turn on her uncle, largely because a ring he gave her was inscribed to TS from RM, and the initials match the victim's maiden name and that of her husband.Uncle Charlie can tell something is wrong, but his niece tries not to say much, until his behavior makes her dying for him to leave-which he refuses to do.There are two suspected murder attempts on young Charlie before the uncle decides to leave, then one more on the train as it pulled away, but that was one too many for the uncle.Hitchcock even worked in a mostly-undeveloped love story between the detective and Charlie-the niece, of course. They barely knew each other, but he flat out said he loved her and hinted at marriage, which she seemed interested in thinking about.I agree with the critics that the pacing was poor. For a long time into the film, we had no knowledge of what Charlie-the uncle-might have done. The happy scenes where he arrived and visited were too long without anything at that point to hold our interest.My theory on why this happened-why Hitch didn't do anything to get us into the mystery sooner-is that it did not seem to slow to him. When you have worked with the whole script and know it well, the beginning seems like a build up and it could hurt to have the film jump into something dramatic too early. Hitchcock and the writers knew all about Charlie and the dangers he was going to present, so they didn't feel the beginning was boring. We viewers didn't know-at least on first viewing-so it seemed dull.Uncle Charlie tries three times to kill his niece and all three of them were quite sloppy and would have surely drawn suspicion on him if successful. But the first two were not that likely to succeed given the way he did it. The third would have had to seem like a murder and he'd be the only suspect.What really didn't work was that that third attempt came after the police had closed the case believing another man they were trailing across the country, a man who died escaping from them, was the killer and they were no longer seeking Charlie. His niece had wanted him to leave their home and he didn't want to. If he just left, she would pose no threat to him and he could go anywhere as not even a suspect anymore. Killing her the way he planned would have forced him to go into hiding as the apparent murderer of his niece. Don't see why he'd want to kill her at that point.If we were supposed to be caught up in the question of whether he was or was not the serial killer, we were given too many facts too early to leave us guessing.Hitchcock's other films have the good guys trying to find the bad guys-Saboteur, 39 Steps, North by Northwest-or trying to get evidence to prove their guilt-Rear Window, Dial M for Murder. Uncle Charlie wasn't trying to commit any crime when he came to visit-only when his niece started figuring things out. We knew where he was, and, of course, had no possibility of finding any evidence about his other crimes. The ring he gave his niece was the only thing incriminating at all, and that couldn't lead to anything more than possession of stolen property. If it had been an issue, he could simply say he bought it from a guy at a train station thinking it would be a good present for his niece.The two youngsters were annoying more than entertaining. About the only interesting thing about the other adults was the almost obsessed discussion between the father of the family and their next door neighbor, as they loved discussing ways to kill someone without being caught.I know of at least three of Hitchcock's films that I rate lower than this-haven't quite seen them all. There are plenty that I found much more satisfying to watch. I give it a 5.",

The two Charlies are kindred spirits meant but never destined to discover their true selves in and through each other. Joseph Cotten (Uncle Charlie) is weary, impulsive, duplicitous, caustic, menacing, and homicidal. Teresa Wright is perfectly cast as his naive but resourceful niece, infatuated with her cunning, forsaken uncle. A story of innocence and experience, an ironic tale of the dark forms self-loathing can take (in Uncle Charlie, it vies with ambition -- itself vying with misanthropic ((or merely misogynist?)) rage. This is nearly Fantasy -- Cotten might be a demon conjured by Wright to help her shed her dream world and translate her sparkling self into the realm of the sluggishly, obtusely, living. But Uncle Charlie is real enough to the widows he's strangled, and little Charlie is his last victim. She lives to learn at the expense of innocence and some of her capacity for love, and bears the burdensome bequeathment of her uncle's true nature.",

That is what Alfred Hitchcock's 1943 suspense thriller Shadow of a Doubt does so beautifully.In the quiet innocent town of Santa Rosa, California, terror is about to enter in the form of a man named Charlie. He is visiting his sister for a while. She has a daughter that is named after Charlie. Young Charlie looks up to Uncle Charlie as a father figure, someone she loves and who loves her too. But she soon realizes that Uncle Charlie might be on the run from some cops.Hitchcock is widely regarded as the master of suspense which he rightly deserves. There definitely is suspense in this movie but he doesn't use it as much like in Rope or Strangers on a Train where the suspense is built around the movie, this movie focuses on the fear of a person who you know is guilty of a crime but you keep refusing that it's true.Joseph Cotten, who is more well known for Orson Welles' movies like Citizen Kane or The Third Man, masterfully plays Uncle Charlie. It's very similar to the performance of Robert Mitchum in Night of the Hunter or Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs: he's a person who comes around as a complete gentleman, but as you get to know him, he could lash out at you to complete his goal, no matter what. Just the way he talks or how clenches his fists together as he's talking to you is only something Hitchcock can do perfectly.The town is also a perfect setting too. This takes place and was filmed in Santa Rosa, California, my home town. It's kind of cool that one of the most acclaimed directors of all time filmed one of his best movies in a place where I've lived my whole life. Santa Rosa is also the perfect town too, the perfect town where everyone is happy and the landscape is beautiful, unknown of the terror that'll take place.The other actors are also pretty good, but the guy that puts the most effort is Joseph Cotten.Alfred Hitchcock put a lot of effort into the movie and it shows. This is a movie that is the definitive Hitchcock movie. And it just so happened to be, his personal favorite.",

            "content": "Uncle Charlie is a killer on the loose, who stays with his sister's family in a peaceful suburban home in an attempt to hide from police. Mystery and intrigue is maintained throughout as we question whether Uncle Charlie is a suspect, while the latter half creates suspense by putting Niece Charlie in danger, as she begins to uncover the truth. The film is masterfully shot - so well in fact, that it seems to have blinded audiences to the plot holes.First, one of the early clues involves the Uncle ripping out a newspaper article regarding the murderers deeds. But he had no need to do that, as the article never tied him to the murders in any way. In fact, only by ripping it out did it become a clue that could be used against him - a cheap narrative tool.Second, Uncle gives Niece a ring with the initials of a deceased engraved on it. This is a guy who has $40k to open a bank account with, do you think he would risk passing on evidence like that instead of simply buying a new ring? Of course not. Third, when the only other suspect in the case is killed, he is labelled the guilty party and case closed. This makes no sense whatsoever. If he was guilty, then Uncle would be innocent. If he wasn't guilty, then Uncle would still be under investigation. There are only two logical paths here and the film takes neither.Fourth, the film keeps hinting at some \"special\" connection between the two Charlies - they share the same names, and an early coincidence makes Niece wonder if they are telepathic. But this connection runs exactly nowhere and one wonders why it was ever introduced. (The romantic subplot between Niece and Detective is also irrelevant, except to try and provide a happy ending).With all this \"doubt\" about, it would have at least been nice to have a twist ending (hell, I'm sure they could have made the family friend Herbert the real killer - they could have at least set up a few more suspects!), but alas, it will not surprise you in any way.An interesting aside are the quirky conversations the father and Herbert have about how to execute 'the perfect murder'. In a career dedicated to the idea, Hitch must have had many of these conversations himself, and we see a few fruits of those conversations towards the end of the film. Instead of saving the best til last however, the climax on the train was the least creative of all. The user Jason in these comments said it perfectly, \"A good ending involving a villain failing is supposed to happen because of the villain's Achilles's heel. Not a Deus ex Machina!\"Although 'Shadow of a Doubt' is not his original story, I'm disappointed to learn Thornton Wilder was one three screenwriters, for his novel 'The Bridge of San Luis Rey' is excellent.",

And i didn't felt the thriller moments. Due to the fact that we took way too long to discover where the story was going, i didn't care for the niece and uncle Charlies at all. The only plus that i find in the story was the cartoon-like supporting characters and the histrionic acting, which brought more 'life' to the movie.

The reason is that the storyline is rather inconceivable. A niece suspects her uncle to be a serial killer but nevertheless doesn't inform the police in order to save her mother the shock of her brother being disgraced. In so doing she puts her own life at risk.The story maybe less believable, the filming technique is (as always in a Hitchcock movie) of high quality. A staircase is used quitte effectively to communicate lack of clarity and threat. The arrival of the uncle in the small village of Santa Rosa by train emanates as much threat as the arrival of Nosferatu in the town of Wisborg by ship in the film of the same name by Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau (1922).As in many Hitchcock films the spectator knows who is the culprit, but the police doesn't. In many other films (The thirty nine steps\" (1935) or \"Dial M for murder\" (1954)) an innocent man has to prove his innocence. In \"Shadow of a doubt\" the police is on the right track, but fails to see behind the tricks of the cunning uncle.",

Hitchcock may have put other movies  together more tautly and more efficiently, but \"Shadow\" has a weird knack for tugging at your bones.  Cotten's performance has a lot to do with this.  I'm not sure that he was ever used more effectively than as the charming, hollow, unnervingly empty Uncle Charlie, a man who has given up on the world, and on morality, conscience, and compassion as well.  There's a real creepiness to the character, and to the way Hitchcock lets darkness creep into the lovely small town where the film is set.  (This aspect of the film reminded me, oddly but inescapably, of Lynch's \"Blue Velvet,\" a comparison that I thought of as irrational until I happened to see another review which brought that film up as well.  Apparently I'm not alone in feeling the connection.)Shots I love: the train carrying Charlie arriving in town, with the camera aimed unusually high to show the sky filling the sky with black smoke; Charlie approaching his welcoming family in a walk that begins in a limp and suddenly rejuvenates, vampirically filled with new energy; Cotten's famous speech to the camera, in close-up; Teresa Wright instinctively clutching her wrist as she speaks in defense of her uncle; Cotten and Wright at the diner in the \"bad\" part of town; and the final fadeout scene.As in \"Blue Velvet,\" (although considerably less flamboyantly) something quite nasty is welling up in the subconscious of this film.

He is building a tight little plot around a small criminal who gets into some serial killing of rich widows in New York or somewhere back East just because he likes money, because he does not like working at all, and because he hates these women who are wasting the money they inherited instead of giving it to someone like him who would make a better use of it since that would prevent him from working ever and forever and might even enable him to open some small business to cover up the bag of green backs. He is on the run. He escapes from the East and moves to California where his sister lives with her family. But the cops are on his tracks and they get quite close. One manages to capture the attention and care of the oldest girl of the family who is over eighteen in order to arrange with her the leaving of the uncle so that he is arrested out of the city. The uncle, the murderer as you have guessed, understands his niece has gotten through the cloud of mystery and has put two and two together and that it does make four in her head. So he has to get rid of her but he fails probably more out of lack of luck than anything else. But the luck of one is the lack of luck of the ether and vice versa. And during that time our uncle is courting the city and becoming some kind of glorious visitor on the music of some Merry Widow. The end is not going to be what he wanted it to be since he will not be able to leave the town but he will not remain at the surface of it either because he will nicely take residence is some kind of wooden underground chamber six feet under. You really feel the growing pains of Hitchcock under this little film that is probably already definitely too small for the big man who is inhabiting it.

            "content": "IT is indeed a point of interest that this Film Noir, psychological thriller would be offered as a diversion to the very real horrors of World War II; which were only too much of a reality to the folks on the home front in 1943. The engagement of American and other Allied Nations in Europe, the Far East, the Pacific and North Africa was enough of a living horror. Interestingly, or perhaps intentionally, any mention of the War is missing from this Contemporary storyline.WE find it further to be an example of totally unfettered irony that the Film is a co-production of the distributor, Universal Pictures; who also released the production. It was Universal, of course, who made its great fame and fortune by producing such classic works of Horror as Lon Chaney's starring vehicles THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME (1923) and THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (19??). Moving into the Sound Era, it was Carl Lemmaele's home studio that gave us Bela Lugosi in Dracula (1931), Boris Karloff as the Monster in FRANKENSTEIN (also '31) and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935); as well as his portrayal of Im-Ho-Tep in THE MUMMY (1932). Further examples of fine works of Gothic Horror are: THE WEREWOLF OF London (1935), THE WOLFMAN (1941); as well as a whole sh*t house full of sequels, spin-offs and All-Star Monster fest crossovers.OBVIOUSLY, Alfred Hitchcock's SHADOW OF A DOUBT (Skirbill Productions/Universal Pictures, 1943) made for a very different sort of Horror Picture; albeit one that should be all the more frightening, for it could happen.HITCH takes a very fine cast and puts them through their paces in the sort of manner to which we have become accustomed. The interplay among the main characters is near perfection; with the cast featuring: Young Charlie Newton (Teresa Wright), Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten ), Detective Jack Graham (MacDonald Carey in his first featured role), Joseph Newton (Henry Travers), Emma Newton (Patricia Collinge), Detective Fred Saunders (Wallace Ford) and a supporting cast of what, hundreds? Some outstanding work is in evidence by some great Character Actors (Face Players). Among them is a very pivotal performance by veteran Clarence Muse as a Pullman Porter and a young Hume Cronyn, in his film debut as the Newton's neighbor and detective novel fanatic, Herbie Hawkins.WE have read that Sir Alfred designed the whole to be a view of the darker side of Life; which even exists on Main Street USA, in our Small Towns. Allegedly this was spurned on by the adaptation of Thornton Wilder's Broadway Drama, OUR TOWN (Sol Lesser's Principal Pictures/United Artists Corporation, 1940)* to the Silver Screen. Indeed, we can fully understand how an offbeat sort of approach, which may well not have translated into big (bleepin') deal Box Office $ucce$$; but surely inspired a degree of Cult Status and Following.THIS inclusion of a huge talent such as Thornton Wilder is certainly a true feather in the cap of the whole Hitchcock Production Team; as the name alone certainly would elevate any Production, even a Three Stooges 2 reeler comedy, to the level above any cinematic endeavour. For this we heartily congratulate Messers Wilder and Hitchcock; but we fail to give an automatic status as a True Work of \"Art\"; for as much as we do truly like this film and have enjoyed multiple viewings of it and would do it again in a New York Minute. We just believe there are just a few minor details that should be discussed and disgusted. That would be the screenplay itself.WHILE the story is inherently gripping, suspenseful and truly horrifying it, like any work of fiction, must take certain artistic license in maintaining continuity, eliminating any unnecessary or repetitive dialogue and in relating its message (whatever that may be). With or without Mr. Thornton Wilder's considerable ability, under the wrong hands of a lesser film maker, the story could be in danger of getting, well, sort of hokey. Our guess that a writer like the above mentioned Pulitzer Prize Winner wrote this in his spare time and could most likely have just \"phoned it in\"; all for a very hand$ome amount of Cold Ca$h Fee$. (Uh, no problem there, Thornton! After all, we all gotta eat!) WELL, thank God that it was a guy like Hitch who did it; when you add the great photographic work done in the real life Santa Rosa, California and New Jersey (which as a by product provided the world with an archival record of Small Town America, circa 1940. Hey, that's what we were sort of started out to do, no? (And we got it, warts and all!) NOTE * Oh, what a surprise to us it was to us to see Producer Sol Lesser's name in our research for the OUR TOWN movie version. Before now, Sol was only known for his productions, such as THE RETURN OF CHANDU (Principal Pictures, 1934) with Bela Lugosi , the TARZAN THE FEARLESS Serial (Principal Pictures, 1933) with Buster Crabbe in his solo outing with the loin cloth of Tarzan. He also was responsible for all of the post-MGM Tarzan Pictures with Johnny Weissmuller done at RKO Radio Pictures.POODLE SCHNITZ!!",

It was easy to see how dangerous even planting the seed of doubt could do to effect trust in someone, especially as evidence mounts up to support the suspicions.It had a weird moment where it jumped very quickly when girl Charlie went on the date with Mr. Graham (One of the Detectives). It was like a whole conversation went missing and that was distracting, especially when they later became attracted to each other almost out of the blue and her affections were torn as a result. Maybe the censors cut out a snogging scene or something?I did like the character of Herb, played by Hume Cronyn and although the part was not much more than a cameo, I really liked Janet Shaw as Louise Finch too. She was a character that I wanted to find out more about and why she had ended up where she was. She could probably have made a perfect victim for whoever the murderer was, because otherwise it seemed a bit odd to have such a presence in the film.Sadly the Mother was way over the top and jarred with the others who played things a lot more casually and with ease, including dear old Clarence, Angel: Third Class (Henry Travers, who played the Dad).The detectives were an odd pair though and they didn't seem to be the usual trigger happy, hired hands that I would have expected.And there were just a lot of bits throughout that didn't make sense- boy Charlie's \"Illness\" at the beginning for one thing.Boy Charlie reminded me of Lois' brother in 'Family Guy' (1999-) and I had to wonder if this was where Seth Macfarlane had got the idea from (Season 4/Episode 17 - Fat Guy Strangler).This was one of those films that I watched, because it featured on Steven Schneider's Top 1001 films list and it was definitely one of the better ones. The story itself was the real beauty of this film and the not knowing what really happened, so I'm glad that I tuned in. I don't think that I'll rush to see it again, but I would definitely be tempted to watch an updated version or to read a novel interpretation.525.63/1000.",

Hitch asks the question: What would you do if you suspected a relative of serial murder? Like real life, his answers are frustrating and gray.

            "content": "The distinction of dramatic tension in Shadow of a Doubt, which is among the highest class of Alfred Hitchcock's direct hits, rests in his powerful instincts for the abstractions of being totally preoccupied with oneself, the way he understands distress and darkness as less intruding outside energy than as the subdued underneath of matters. A bored teenager, portrayed in a tender, unabashedly feminine performance by the uniquely sweet and wise Teresa Wright, is bothered because nothing appears to be going on in her life. Then, she gets the most exciting news that her uncle, whom she dearly loves, in Joseph Cotton's inarguably greatest performance is coming to town. The contrasting extremities are each safe and sound in its spot, but are both obliged jointly. In spite of Thornton Wilder's hand in the script, this is not at all like Our Town. The film's warmth for romanticized American culture is genuine, but there is an aching curiosity. Is one to simply accept this picturesque environment as is? This is the idealized small town with its family values? This penetrative hankering filtering throughout the sun-spotted squares and courtyards and social gatherings that visibly conjecture Wright's growing consciousness as the film's budding realization. The insular contentment of this quaint community is distrusted by Cotten's arrival, which highlights not how much of an outsider he is but how much a part of it he continues to be since he last left. His portrayal as Wright's beloved uncle appears as nearly a caricature of the clean-shaven, mild-mannered likeness appreciated by conventional public. In the course of one of the swift moments that suggest an unpleasant reality behind his pleasant facade, Hitchcock dollies in tight on him, delicately veering Cotten's mildly agreeable facial appearance into a faint callousness.Exactly as dark, unsavory truths and images are shown to have a face, so does the benevolent surface of morality comes apart to let ominous gravity slip, as intimated by one of the hands-down most brilliant devices in Hitchcock's work, the subconscious hints at the Merry Widow Waltz, which are like Freudian slips for the characters, in a film which is otherwise scored by Dmitri Tiomkin, whose score is the mortar for the film's bricks and tiles. Wright's mother is crazy about her baby brother to a curiously overwhelming degree, the father plays morose games with the neighbor, Hume Cronyn, always a delightful surprise, who is obsessed with murder mysteries, and the air of security is merely a threadbare film taut over the world. The underpinnings of darkness may have just a footstep to go, and at the heart of it all is Teresa Wright, finding her way through troubled waters of her own into adulthood. Her angelic purity is stained in the course of her tribulation, but Hitchcock realizes the course as obligatory, her idyllic life cruelly forced open, and her responsibility to face life's capability of wickedness and malevolence, in addition to her inevitable link with it. (Speaking of which, however, if I'm locked in a garage with a car's engine running, I might reasonably employ the car in reverse to break out, but why nitpick an otherwise enormously effective scene?)That the movie is filmed in black and white is seminal. Its transition from the seedy, mystifying introduction of Uncle Charlie and the simple down-home introduction of young Charlie must not be too obvious. They have the same black and white complexion to disguise the vast distinctions between their initial environments.Wright seems to be pouring her fullest heart into her performance in profuse strains of unpremeditated reactions and feelings as this dark, probing, intensely feeling girl who happens to have been surrounded her entire life by a pleasant facade. So she is prone to a cynical view of day-to-day life until her uncle shows and her perspective is rejuvenated, which makes her suspicion much more tense, resistant and tortuous, as well as when we see how much she hates being betrayed. A great touch I always find cynically funny is the character of her little sister as some idealistic intellectual of the generation to continue, hardly through elementary school and rattling off aphorisms while independently reading Ivanhoe. Cotten, likewise, is able to plunge into the depths he would normally seem too sociable and pleasantly persuasive to be typically asked of him, portraying a dark, shadowy man whose experience is on the subterranean side of the life that he lives apart from his family, that brooding disposition leaking into the sensibilities that once called this small town home.Shadow of a Doubt is about the insulated opening their eyes to the macrocosm of existence, the concurrent shadowing and broadening of the perception of the world. And conversely, Wright's protagonist has to silence her revelation as to not unsettle the harmony of her family and her environment. This masterpiece of suspense is one of Hitchcock's most ruthless portrayals of an outrageous certainty divulged no more than to be renounced.",

            "content": "One of the problems with Hitchcock's films is that he's been imitated so many times by now (an brilliantly parodied by Mel Brooks) that when you see one of his stylistic devices - it seems clich\u00e9d, even though probably at the time it was original. Also, and he admits this, his plots are always full of holes but as long as there is enough pace or misdirection, there isn't time to dwell upon it.In this film unfortunately, both of these problems really make this hard to enjoy. For example, the close shot of Cotten talking about the nasty lives of widows seems comically over-dramatic and the use of music esp the Merry Widow Waltz is corny. The plot is as always, full of holes, made worse by the fact that modern audiences are much more sophisticated than our heroine. Of course, that's true for most older movies but I found them harder to overlook here since everything was being taken so seriously and telegraphed so clumsily by today's standards. I couldn't help but laugh at spots. However, it's still worth watching. Teresa Wright's naivet\u00e9 enhances and indeed makes possible the ethical conflict underlying the tension in the film and Joseph Cotten is very good as the creepy uncle. However, the thing that made this film worthwhile for me was that when you think about it, all the town characters are portrayed as dupes completely fooled by Cotten with Teresa Wright being the smartest of them all and still only prevailing through good luck. Perhaps this is intentional and Cotten's sardonic remark that people like them wouldn't understand the real world was not that of a deranged sociopath but Hitchcock's low opinion of Wilder's Our Town. And he was able to do this directly and in full view of an applauding American audience, knowing full well that it went over their heads. I can see why this was his personal favourite.",

            "content": "There's something extra sinister about this tale of lost innocence in a sleepy little California town. The dramatization and fictionalization of a real life killer takes what could have been completely standard tropes and twists them an extra degree or two by adding in an element of familial loyalty that makes the situation more than just another tale of grizzly murder. It helps that Joseph Cotton is just so great as Charlie Oakley, the alternatively charming and menacing uncle come to visit from the East.At the heart of this story is the spoiling of a dream, of realizing that those you idolize are humans and not super beings, but it takes that rather normal realization that we all go through and goes even further. Charlie Newton, a young woman out of high school and still living at home with her parents and two younger siblings, is in a rut and decides that the best thing to fix everything that's plaguing her would be a visit from her uncle, her namesake Charlie Oakley. At the same time, Charlie Oakley is alone in his small one room residence in a boarding house in Philadelphia. Outside are two men who want him for unspecified reasons, so Oakley decides that the best thing to do would be to go out West to visit his sister and her family in Santa Rosa, California.The news that the elder Charlie is coming after the younger Charlie merely thought of it ignites her with excitement. It feels like some kind of great turn of fate, a telepathic connection between her and her namesake. They're so alike, she notes, with similar traits, and the wide-eyed happiness she shows when she looks at him for the first time in years, but the elder Charlie is hiding something horrible just beneath his placid veneer. This corruption of something that's supposed to be so safe, both the family unit and the small idealized town of Santa Rosa, by the elder Charlie's mere presence is the makings of a horror film. The younger Charlie's slow realization of the reality of who her uncle is functions as the core of the film, and it's what makes it all work. She has her own clues to dig out, things that could be explained away, but she also has external voices pushing her along in the form of two out of state law enforcement officials.Through all of the small reveals, including some from Uncle Charlie himself, the younger Charlie just can't quite let go of her admiration and love for that idealized uncle of hers.Everything about this movie is pitch perfect. From the performances to the steady reveal of Uncle Charlie's past and the younger Charlie's investigation, to the side characters, everything comes together to create a complete package of a story. Emma, Uncle Charlie's sister, loves her brother so much and can't bear the thought of anything bad about him, providing the younger Charlie the perfect emotional reason to simply not out her uncle on top of her own conflicting feelings towards him. Emma's husband gets caught up with a friend talking about the perfect way to murder each other in a friendly game of wits, and it feeds directly into the overall story dealing with Uncle Charlie's past.Forced to operate under war time limitations about the amount of money a movie could spend on a set, Shadow of a Doubt was filmed in Santa Rosa itself, including the two-story house that functions as the family's home. It looks great, filmed in beautiful black and white by Joseph Valentine and with a surprisingly strong score from Dimitri Tiomkin, the movie's disparate elements come together to create a perfectly cohesive picture that focused on ramping up the tension from beginning to end as we discover the truth of Uncle Charlie and then watch as the younger Charlie tries to find a way to get rid of him without outing him at the same time.This is up there with The 39 Steps and Rebecca as Hitchcock's finest work up to this point in his career.",

            "content": "Hitchcock's favourite of his own films, 1943's Shadow of a Doubt is a classic thriller from the Master of Suspense. It's been described as a film noir, although it isn't a typical example of the form: for one thing, it lacks a femme fatale, and for another it's a relatively unusual example of a Hitchcock thriller with a strong female lead.\nShadow of a Doubt sees Joseph Cotten cast against type as Uncle Charlie, a serial killer of rich widows who decides to lay low and stays with his sister's family in the small American town of Santa Rosa, California, in which all of the film apart from the opening scenes is set. Welcomed by his relatives, he soon starts to attract the suspicion of his niece, Charlotte \"Charlie\" Newton, who is named after him and according to her mother is much like him in some ways, reminiscent of the doubles/opposites theme of Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train.\nThe plot has a slowly building, relentless pace, with the first half showing Charlie's growing suspicions hardening into terrible certainty, and the second half turning into a battle of wits between her and her uncle, as she tries to force him to leave - with some encouragement from Detective Jack Graham - and he tries to kill her without arousing the suspicions of his sister, Charlie's mother. It's typically gripping, and masterfully executed. Cotten proves well cast, making good use of his natural charm and charisma whilst proving to be convincingly menacing when the script requires. Teresa Wright plays his niece, intelligent, determined, and refusing to be intimidated to the very end. The actors hint at subtle sexual undertones in some of the early scenes between Uncle Charlie and his niece; Wright makes her seem almost flirtatious and Cotten reciprocates in kind.\nThe characters are well-drawn, with the screenplay - written by Thornton Wilder, Sally Benson and Alma Reville - boasting some excellent dialogue, for example Charlie's philosophical musing about her family. Henry Travers' Joseph Newton - Charlie's father - is an aficionado of crime fiction and whilst his character is used as comic relief, his conversations with his crime author friend Herbie about how to commit the perfect murder contrast the usual tropes of crime fiction with the motivations of Uncle Charlie, who lets his fa\u00e7ade crack when they are talking about the subject in his presence.\nAs usual Hitchcock assembles all the necessary ingredients for a perfectly-crafted film: as well as the two stars, nine year old Edna May Wonacott handles Ann Newton's precocious dialogue very well, Macdonald Carey's Jack Graham provides an affable and reassuring counterpoint to Uncle Charlie's malignant presence in Charlie's life, and Patricia Collinge is excellent as Charlie's na\u00efve mother Emma, who thinks the world of her brother. Dimitri Tiomkin's score tends towards the melodramatic, but suits the plot well enough, whilst cinematographer Joseph A. Valentine provides some fine camerawork, for example the early shots from above when Uncle Charlie evades his two pursuers. The camera following an agitated Charlie through the streets reflects her inner turmoil. The close-up of the newspaper article about the Merry Widow Murderer is striking and it emphasises a key moment, since this cements in Charlie's mind the realisation that her uncle is the criminal that Graham believes. Later, the camera zooms in on Charlie's face during his bitter diatribe about rich widows, emphasising the chilling implications of what he is saying.\nHitchcock made a great many films, and the vast majority of them are highly regarded as classics. That Shadow of a Doubt was his own personal favourite is not too surprising: whilst it is perhaps over-shadowed by later works such as Psycho and Vertigo, it remains a superb example of the director at the top of his game and it retains its power to both thrill and chill.",

            "content": "This 1943 Hitchcock film is really like nothing I've ever seen. It is devoid of twists or needlessly flashy film-making\u0097it just tells a story from beginning to the end, and all the while keeps you very entertained with great acting, dialog and various indescribable nuances.The story revolves around a family in a small California town (interesting note: the movie was made in 1943 yet there's no mention of the war. I think this helps preserve the feeling of small town isolation). The oldest daughter named Charlie is bored with her family's ho-hum life. Then, UNCLE Charlie comes to town (played magnificently by Joseph Cotton) because he wants \"to settle down\", but to the viewer it seems like he's running away from something. He has a lot of cash and wants to open a bank account. Two men have been carefully following him since the beginning of the film. I'm not going to give away any more because it's pretty cool.What was so stunning about this movie is that we as modern movie enthusiasts expect a good movie to have something hidden, something up its sleeve. Well, this one doesn't, which is a fresh change for us modern types. A remake would be impossible--modern audiences would consider it \"tame\". However, the story excels within the confines of its time. Any remake would be a joke.The family is very interesting to observe. The little girl Anne almost steals the show. She's literate and unintentionally snobby\u0097like a nine-year-old Ayn Rand. The father is kind of aloof and simple\u0097he and his neighbor friend are constantly talking about the \"science\" of committing murders, which serves as a great backdrop to the suspense going on right under their noses.Thornton Wilder wrote it.

Her description of her relationship with her uncle is more like that of a soulmate than a \"twin.\" She reacts to his homecoming more as a girlfriend than as a niece. Just the physical interactions between the two of them are strangely ... romantic? Uncle Charlie grabs his niece and, instead of giving her a ring, he slips it on her finger, like an engagement ring. Young Charlie enjoys being seen with her uncle (notice the jealous looks on her friends' faces-they don't know he's her uncle!). Even as her suspicions grow and *spoilers* he becomes more violent with her, he always grabs her so that her face is very near his. He's upset about her relationship with Jack, not just because he's a detective, but because Jack is taking away HIS Charlie. Uncle HAS to dominate. He dominates his sister by manipulating her emotions through memory, but his domination of Charlie seems more sexual. Just another twist in Uncle Charlies malformed character.

This is a serious and unbalancing omission if the film is meant to be watched \"straight\" as a suspense drama with character and situation based tension. However as a dark comedy foregrounding family drama and juvenile/adolescent dreams this sense of ineffectiveness serves the dramatic purpose quite well.I rate an equally comfortable 5.5/10 which I have gladly rounded up to a 6/10 score and I recommend to fans of well crafted cinema and of the stars.

Joseph Cotten is superb as \"Uncle Charlie\" Oakley and Teresa Wright is excellent as well as \"Little Charlie\", his adoring niece.

The turning point though is when Teresa Wright loses faith in her Uncle.  One negative is Macdonald Carey.  I didn't think that he performed as well as the rest of the cast. Although Wright had won an oscar for supporting actress, it didn't seem to me that she ever became really famous.  I told some friends of mine of this movie and they all had heard of Cotten, but they hadn't heard of Wright.  A couple of interesting things about this movie:  1)  Hume Cronyn who was a comical character in the movie would continue to have an association with Hitch in all phases--he would help write the screenplay to Rope and he would appear in a couple of episodes in Hitch's TV series, 2) Cotten may have been in the most memorable Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode ever  entitled \"Breakdown\".

Theresa Wright is his devoted niece who finds her loyalty to her Uncle Charlie, her hero, gradually slipping away. The cast is rounded out by Henry Travers and Patricia Collonge as Theresa Wright's small town parents; Macdonald Carey as the police detective; Hume Cronyn as the father's buddy, who shares his passion for crime as a hobby; and Edna May Wannacott, a wonderful child actor, is the younger sister Anne, who is a delight each time she appears.Thornton Wilder's was Hitchcock's personal choice as writer of the script because Hitchcock enjoyed his book Our Town. However, Shadow of a Doubt lacked the wit or repartee of other movies. Both the script and the film-making itself seemed to lack Hitchcock's usual style. Hitchcock's movies have humour, entertaining sidebars, amusing supporting actors, and vignettes but this movie just seems to lack any resemblance to his usual standard of entertainment. Uncle Charlie's character is charming but totally heartless. The character attracts the loathing of the audience.

Where are the throngs of people on the streets of this metropolis? Why, they're all in Santa Rosa! Note how every street scene there is filled with happy pedestrians. As packed with citizenry as this little town is, they know each other -- the traffic cop and librarian know the girl by name. It's Thornton Wilder at work here.Now why is this complex? Because there's a war on, yet no mention is made of it. Maybe the script was written before Dec, 1941. The only nods to that condition I saw were the Army soldiers happily on the streets, the Buy Bonds sticker over teller window, and the snippet of a TOJO headline on a library newspaper. But the war wasn't lost on Hitchcock, who'd had years of it in Britain and Europe.He was telling us, through the treatment of the towns, and the lead characters, that our small-town innocence was about to be ravished by what was REALLY going on in the world.Uncle Charlie is a metaphor for the evil that is out there, that we assume will never assault our protected, insulated lives. (One could even say he had the mesmerizing charm of Hitler, and was as dangerous.) By the time this movie ends, how his niece must long for the boring, yet happy days she's now lost forever. A coming-of-age story, not just from the eyes of a young girl -- but from the eyes of small-town America.Then there's the complexity of the relationships. I noted a discussion thread here that postulates that Hitchcock was suggesting an incestuous past, or longing, between the leads. Way off base. Some people will see Freudian implications in a train wreck. He didn't throw his hat on her bed to \"claim his territory\" with her, but to flaunt his disregard for the father's superstition. His is an arrogant superiority at work, not a desire for his niece. Hers is not sexual tension; it is genuine joy at knowing her idolized uncle is on the way to visit -- after all, she was named after him, and her mother (his sister) has always idolized him herself. But from the first pain inflicted on her wrist, she slowly grows more and more suspicious of his perceived perfection. She is not starry-eyed, but centered -- after all, she very maturely reacts to the detective's proposal. But to her, Uncle Charlie represented all the good in the world, and soon he equals the opposite.

            "content": "The movie in discussion is Alfred Hitchcock's \"Without a shadow of doubt.\" I was confused saw was when Charlie finally puts together the reasoning of why her uncle Charlie rips up the newspaper to show her siblings how to make a house out of it. The underlying message was that his face was in the paper for being wanted. A second scene of confusion was when Charlie is suspecting her uncle and matches the initials on the ring he gave her to the initials of the murder victim she saw in the paper. She made the connection between the initials, why the paper was being ripped up, and proof for her standing suspicions. The first scene comes shortly after the film starts, when Ann takes a phone call for her mother. She all but blatantly ignores the woman marking her message to her mother as unimportant, and the message she is trying to get to in her novel as more important. Another scene that is when Charlie passes out in the garage and after Herb saves her everyone is cutting him off and ignoring him. Everyone is ignoring or filtering out the message he is trying to get across and filtering in the \"What if\" messages by the rest of the group. I also noticed that just about every time Ann made a comment it was contradictory and had a sense of evaluation hidden in it. One scene where this is prevalent is where Charlie says her family is falling apart and saying that all other families are happy, she is grouping them all together. A second scene that displays this is when Uncle Charlie confesses to Charlie about the murder and says they will give him the electric chair. They will physically kill him and figuratively kill her mother, grouping them together based on consequence. One scene where this takes place is where Charlie's father says that her mother was too busy making dinner to attend the big get together they have at the house. He is pretty much stereotyping women and what they do in the household. A second scene where this takes place is where Charlie says that she is becoming a nagging old maid, passing a stereotype on a certain social oupinggroup. A scene where this takes place is where Charlie's father says that Uncle Charlie is a New York man, generalizing what he is and spreading it to all New York natives. A second scene where this is shown is where Charlie is complaining about her family saying they are boring compared to other families. She is generalizing that all other families outside of her own are much more exciting. One scene where this is shown is where Charlie talks about her relationship between her and her uncle, constructing it to be much more serious than it is saying things have changed(for the better) since he came into town. The elements of their relationship are somewhat far spaced so to speak but now that Charlie and her uncle are closer in proximity she feels closer to him emotionally when in all reality she is not and it is more of a heat of the moment kind of thing. A way this is shown is when Uncle Charlie arrives bearing gifts and wanting to open a bank account with a huge amount of money. The message behind this is one of superiority to the rest of the family. Another scene where this is shown is when Charlie's father and Herb are talking about killing each other and Charlie snaps on them. The hidden message is that something is bothering her and something they were talking about related to her problem. Also I thought it was interesting when Uncle Charlie dies in the end and the trip scene resembles the Widow Waltz from the beginning.",

            "content": "The Newton family receives a telegram that their uncle Charlie is coming to town to spend some time with them. His niece, whom is named after him suspects that he is not all he claims to be, when two detectives start questioning them.Rope, Saboteur and now Shadow of A Doubt. These are the only three films from the legendary Hitchcock that I have seen. Each one couldn't be more different. One is confined to one room, while another takes one character across America. Shadow of a Doubt tells the tale of family secrets and takes us to a small town. The film creates the tension needed to make one just uneasy enough to sit through the film. Shadow of a Doubt is considered one of Hitchcock's classic films and according to his daughter, his personal favourite. I found it to be rather brilliant at times, but testing at others. Joseph Cotten plays the character of uncle Charlie, who is downright frightening at times and made my enjoyment of the film more fulfilling. I won't go into detail about the plot of the film, I went in knowing nothing about it and appreciate it more because of that. The film doesn't depend on star power or any glamour, just the story and characters. The uncle Charlie character is one creepy guy who is portrayed brilliantly by Joseph Cotten. In one brilliant scene he has a monologue that is pretty harsh, even by today's standards and one simple turn of the head makes the scene all the more intense and creepy.The film doesn't reach the suspense levels of other films in his catalogue, I've seen bits and pieces of Rear Window, which was more suspenseful, but it does have the slow burner feel that builds up to something. You know some kind of confrontation is about to happen at the climax and your itching for it to happen the whole time. A few things did bother me though, even if they were intentional.The sexual tension between uncle and niece is just a bit much. It seemed that in every scene they were itching to go at each other. The constant talking about how much they have in common and how they are so alike is fine, until they start to hold each other and get close. It's uncomfortable. Second, the detective declaring his love for Charlie, totally out of place. To me there was not enough room for the two to grow as a romantic couple. Does she feel the same way? No, which is what made me a little bit happier, had she had the same feelings as him, I would have been upset with this film.Shadow of a Doubt is a well crafted thriller that doesn't mind taking it's time getting to where it wants to go. Subtle hints here and there adds to the mystery of what's going and is intriguing. It pulls the viewer into the web that is this story. It's not my favourite Hitchcock film, but rather one that I appreciate and respect the most, at least so far.",

            "content": "By now, this is the fourth Hitchcock film that I've seen and it certainly is a better representation of what I understood his work to be than SABOTEUR was. SHADOW OF A DOUBT, which Hitchcock said was his favorite, is a rather simple tale that explores one of his favorite themes: mistaken identity. Joseph Cotten (THE THIRD MAN) plays \"Uncle Charlie\" who visits his family for a visit in Santa Rosa, California. However, he's not quite what his young niece Charlie remembers. One thing I've noticed about Hitchcock's films is the various ways he's able to create tension and suspense in a way that keeps the viewer hooked. Some of the elements he uses includes light and shadow, camera angles, the score, etc. All of them came together in a rather cohesive way that kept me interested in seeing where the story would go. This film also captures an America in transition. The world created here isn't the paranoia-filled one of SABOTEUR, but still one where suspicion is very palpable and there's a sense that trust is becoming less of an innate quality in Everytown, USA. Like in SABOTEUR, there are two characters who serve as thematic counterpoint to each other. Here, they are the two Charlies. Joseph Cotten's character is somewhat of an idealized figure for his young niece (Teresa Wright), but the reality of how cynical and pessimistic he really is gets revealed over the course of the film. I thought it was a brilliant way of showing how expectations measure up when faced with reality. There's also the \"is he/isn't he?\" sense of if he's really even the person he purports to be, which plays into the themes of suspicion and trust. One thing I wasn't entirely expecting was the awkward sexual tension (in a few scenes) between the two Charlies, which added an incest layer that helped to flesh out the tense relationship between them. If there's anything weak about the film, the ending was a bit abrupt and a romance that develops between young Charlie and a detective seemed to be shoehorned in (and provided for an unnecessary coda. Still, I liked this film very much and it bodes well for the successive Hitchcock films I'll be viewing later this month.",

It isn't until the tension and suspense come to a peak by movie's end, that you feel the true power of this story.

            "review_title": "The Legendary Hitchcock's favorite",
            "content": "\"Shadow of a Doubt\" is a movie surrounded by a particularly special mystique a bit different from Alfred Hitchcock's other better known works. The source of such aura is the rumor that this film was the personal favorite of the Master of Suspense himself. Wheter this is true or not, it is not hard to believe that this flawless mixture of film noir and thriller could be really the favorite of the legendary British filmmaker, as it contains the theme and elements Hitchcock loved in the stories he put on film.Loosely based on a story by Gordon McDonell, the plot focuses on Charlotte \"Charlie\" Newton (Teresa Wright), a young high school girl tired of the monotony of her suburban life in Santa Rosa. One day, she receives a telegram announcing the visit of her favorite uncle, who is also nicknamed Charlie (Joseph Cotten). They have always had a special relationship but this time, a sinister shadow will cover their lives as the young Charlie will discover that her favorite uncle is probably a psychotic serial killer.The film contains many of the aspects of the suspense that Hitchcock mastered through the years. It is no mystery that Uncle Charlie is the murderer, as it is stated almost from the beginning that he is really the \"Merry Widow Killer\"; the suspense lays in the fact that the rest of the characters have no idea of what kind of man Charlie is. And even when the young Charlie begins to suspect, the love for her uncle clouds her vision.The Master of Suspense handles the tension between the two Charlies with excellent technique. Presented as equal but different at the same time; the two Charlies represent two extreme sides of human nature that coexist in modern society. The excellent performances of Cotten and Wright are of high importance for the success of this film, as the two opposite forces in the conflict.Joseph Cotten creates a haunting Uncle Charlie; as charming as deadly, his character may not be as well remembered as Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates, but he contains the same power as the memorable Motel owner. Teresa Wright also shines in her role, with a very emotional performance as the young girl who must face the reality of the world, a world that is scarier than she thought, with horrors a lot closer to home than she ever imagined.\"Shadow of a Doubt\" plays with the idea of the \"All-American Family\" with subtle yet sharp irony, and moves into the dark side of the suburban society and its dubious morale. How can this apparently perfect and happy environment create a serial killer? Uncle Charlie is the absolute representation of evil, and Hitchcock made him not a stranger nor a foreigner, he made him a charming member of the typical American family.Hitchcock made the bold move of portraying the dark side of the U.S. society in a time when most American filmmakers where trying to offer happier tales as a escape from the grim reality of of World War II. However, the film has it's small dose of the witty dark humor always present in the master's works; one has to wonder if the characters of Charlie's father Joseph and his friend Herb Hawkins, as well as their morbid fascination with bizarre murders are not based on Hitchcock himself.\"Shadow of a Doubt\" is one more of the perfect works of art the Master of Suspense's legacy. A movie filled with haunting images and witty social cometary, it truly deserves to be seen and be known for what it is, and not only, as the Master's favorite. 10/10",

Most of the reason Cotten is good is that he lets the camera do its job.The pacing and the editing is where this movie really lost me. It's either a wacky experiment in storytelling or it was left until the last minute. The first twenty minutes are very slow, until we get to the first shock, and it isn't even all that shocking. Then it slows down again and doesn't really get going until the final sequences. Normally, this wouldn't bother me, but it's really obvious and distracting. Crucial plot elements are zipped along, and then the camera experiments take their time to show us the inner lives of the characters, needlessly.Also, someone should remove about 80% of the orchestra from the soundtrack.

The film is brilliant, starring actress Teresa Wright and actor Joseph Cotton in a tense, well-acted display of one man's hidden evil, in juxtaposition to a town's innate goodness. Throughout the film, I kept hoping Young Charlie's uncle would be revealed to be innocent, possibly because his character displayed redeeming qualities. Most of all, the film explored Young Charlie's journey from innocence to reality in such a way that all of us lost a small portion of our childlike innocence. My favorite scene was when Young Charlie came down the stairs, wearing that emerald ring, causing the smile that was on her uncle's hopeful face to change to the sudden realization that he had to silence his favorite niece in order to keep his murderous past a secret.

Unfortunately, trouble seems to follow him.Or...Plot line: Bored, directionless Charles Oakley (Joseph Cotton) - a jobless, thirty-something, single man, with a lot of money - is being stalked by men who look like gumshoes. After expertly giving them the slip, Oakley decides it's best to hide out with his sister's family in the sleepy, wonderous town of Santa Rosa, CA - where he is known as \"Uncle Charlie\". Unfortunately, his favorite niece and namesake, the fawning Young Charlie Newton, is becoming too inquisitive...In this collaboration between Alfred Hitchcock and Thornton Wilder plot lines don't do this film justice. There is a richness of detail in the characterizations and the dialogue that still holds more than seventy years after the making of the film. In truth, Hitchcock would never be able to achieve the communal feel that he masterfully captured in this film, and Wilder would never be able to weave the tension or menace that kept this film going all the way to the end in any of his works.This was the second Hitchcock film I had seen as a child - the first being 1934's The Man Who Knew Too Much. I remembered thinking that this filmmaker must concentrate on family films - dark, family films, though.It is not an average Hitchcock film. There are no monuments to climb such as Big Ben. Nor are there any ships to wreck. If you're a Hitchcock fan, you'll also miss the gunplay and extended chase sequences. Young Charlie is not a cool, icy blonde. She is a raven head, young adult who speaks her feelings plainly. And Uncle Charlie? He is Hitchcock's first (Norman Bates being the second) anti-hero. He also speaks his feelings plainly. But boy can these Charlies keep secrets!The Charlies are the set pieces in this Hitchcock film. Joseph Valentine photographed them in bookend poses, in order to emphasis the closeness...UNNATURAL closeness...between the two. Instead of guns, there is a lot of power play between these self made \"twins\", flipping who is in control and who's not.IMO Young Charlie is arguably Hitchcock's best Heroine. She has many emotional hurdles to overcome, and she does it without fueling anyone's suspicions that something is amiss. Her aim to protect her family is one many of the viewing audience can understand. In a great performance by Wright, Charlie's wits were all she had to keep her alive.She needed it. For all though there is much debate as to who is the best Hitchcock heroine, there is very little over who is the best antagonist. That honor goes to Joseph Cotton's creepy Uncle Charlie. Prequels are needed for this character. This layered, hard to pin down, portrayal of the bad guy (?) was what Hitchcock had wanted for the character of Johnnie, Cary Grant's role in Suspicion. But the studio balked at their matin\u00e9e idol playing a cold-blooded killing villain; so, Johnnie's ending was re-shot to show that he was Mr. Okay.No such road blocks stood in Joseph Cotton's way. As it was, he was able to craft one of the most memorable characters in film history. Why the studios favored Grant over Cotton, idk. Maybe they had high hopes for the end film. (It got an Oscar nomination for Best Story.) (Strangely enough, the only heroine who garnered attention from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences was the weakest, Johnnie's wife, Lina as played by Joan Fontaine.)P. S.Young Charlie gets involved with the silliest love story Alfred Hitchcock ever directed. In a documentary on the film, Theresa Wright said that Hitchcock's wife, co-screenwriter Alma Reville, Patricia Collinge, who played Emma Newton, and Wright, herself, backed Hitchcock off of exploring the relationship any further, due to Young Charlie's age and the tribulations that the character was suffering. As it is filmed, it becomes another trial for Young Charlie: having to deal with a love sick fool. Collinge rewrote the scenes to distance the love interest.",

One of the last scenes where Little Charlie and her brother and sister go out to say good bye to their Uncle, is very obvious that something unexpected will happen, but again, the mystery is: What will happen? Great Movie. I agree with Hitchcock that this is his best one.",

From Joseph Cotton's utterly believable inhabitation of the central character to Teresa Wright's dawning realisation of the facts, this is a very absorbing piece of cinema. As usual, there are some beautiful set pieces and the director really engages your attention, which is really all that one can ask as a viewer.I find it quite sad that Cotton never landed an Oscar for this, or for any of his other roles for that matter, as he really had what it took. As a side note, for any 'It's A Wonderful Life' fans, you will immediately spot the presence of a certain Henry Travers - aka Clarence the angel.In summary, for me this is the definitive Hitchcock film, and should be in any discerning film buff's library.",

            "content": "\"Shadow of a Doubt\" is often listed as Alfred Hitchcock's favorite of his own films, and while it's not his greatest masterpiece, his liking for it is perfectly understandable. Not only is it an engaging and well-crafted thriller, but it also illustrates a typical Hitchcock theme: the seedy underbelly and the dangerous psychological impulses that lie beneath civilized society. The screenplay by Thornton Wilder has the folksy humor about small-town family life that you'd expect from the author of \"Our Town.\" But it also finds room for some hilariously dark jokes \u0097two respectable citizens relax by reading cheap mystery novels and discussing the best way to kill somebody.Meanwhile, these characters have no idea that there may be an actual criminal in their midst. On the run from the law, Charlie (Joseph Cotten) has come to stay with his sister and her family in sleepy little Santa Rosa, CA. His adoring teenaged niece, also called Charlie (Teresa Wright) is thrilled at her uncle's visit, until she finds more and more reason to suspect that he might be the \"Merry Widow Murderer.\"As played by Cotten, Charlie is an outwardly charming man who conceals a vicious nihilism: he believes that nothing matters, that many people don't deserve to live, and that he can do whatever he likes. This philosophy is powerfully disturbing even today, and must have been even more so at the height of World War II, when \"Shadow of a Doubt\" came out. At that time, America was fighting an enemy that also thought certain people just didn't deserve to live, so I can see how the theme of \"heartland values\" versus nihilism might really have resonated.Those of you who find Hitchcock too misogynistic will be pleased that \"Shadow of a Doubt\" features a smart, likable heroine who's stronger than she looks\u0097even if she does have a weird relationship with her uncle. However, weird as the relationship may be, it gives the movie a scary ambiguity. If even a sweet teenage girl is nearly \"seduced\" by this man's nihilistic philosophy\u0097if the two Charlies claim to feel a special quasi-psychic connection, and then, when Uncle Charlie's true nature is revealed, seriously threaten to kill one another, like volatile lovers\u0097maybe there isn't as much difference between hero and villain as we'd like to think.",

There are also times when knowing is the best thing because it allows you to see the whole picture, clearly and without any outer influence upon this knowledge but it's never a good idea of trying and hiding the truth behind closed doors of one's fear of possible consequences that will follow.\"Shadow of a doubt\" is Hitchcock's favorite picture according to the master himself and I can totally see why: the suspense building and the suspicions scattered around here and there all over the movie are at its finest. Personally I loved this rollercoaster of suspicions going on inside my head while watching the film: is he or isn't he? And if it's not him then who? Maybe it's him after all? Yet again maybe not? This is the best thing that could happen to a movie - it receives its own life within its runtime and you can't help watching it till the end.The plot follows the main protagonist who seems to flee from something to his family relatives where he is loved and cherished; the main female protagonist seems to wear shades on her brows and therefore has to get rid of them in order to be able not to flee her whole life and their relationship changes from love to amazement to suspicion to fear oh so quickly.Joseph Cotten is glorious in his role. He is the sole reason I love this movie so much, along with so many smaller ones, like unusual camera angles, beautiful close-ups, stupendous score by Dimitri Tiomkin, great performances and naturally the suspense building, Alfred's trademark and genius.Judging the book by its cover is the easiest thing and it seems wrong to do it this way. But getting to the bottom of it, from cover to cover, helps you see it past the pretty picture right into the heart of it to say without a shadow of a doubt that this is a truly great book.",

She is constantly bored with her idyllic life. Her uncle Charlie Oakley (Joseph Cotten) is having his own problems. He is a suspected murderer who begins to distrust everyone. Oakley makes a visit to the Newton house. Oakley seems like a nice guy. But After talking with detective Jack Graham (Macdonald Carey) Charlie begins to suspect that Oakley may just be a serial killer. Charlie can not believe him to be a murderer but she starts observing him to act strangely and out of place. Like getting angry when someone takes his photo, being outspoken about rich widows (who also happen to be the victims in these murder cases) and taking a newspaper from Charlie when he sees that it has an article about the murders. I won't give away anything else I'll just let you see it for yourself. This is one of the first definite Alfred Hitchcock classics. Hitchcock made several other films before which were excellent, but this is the first one he made that would join the ranks of Rear Window (1954) and North by Northwest (1959).

            "content": "When I first saw the classic SHADOW OF A DOUBT when I was younger, I did not realize it was an Alfred Hitchcock movie. The movie, made in 1943, was unlike any movie Hitchcock had done before or for that matter after. It was Hitchcock's only \"purely American\" movie, and the movie was years ahead of itself in suspense, intrigue, and dialogue. While many films of the day were musicals about how the boy gets the girl, SHADOW OF A DOUBT truly is a film that has not aged much. Some 67 years after its release the film is still quite watchable and the suspense is more riveting than any 3D or special effects movie.Starring Joseph Cotten, Teresa Wright, and MacDonald Carey, SHADOW OF A DOUBT was one of Joseph Cotten's finest roles. Alfred Hitchcock appears about 15 minutes into the film, on the train to Santa Rosa, playing bridge with a man and a woman (Dr and Mrs. Harry). Charlie Oakley is traveling on the train under the assumed name of Otis. Mrs. Harry is eager to help Otis, who is feigning illness in order to avoid meeting fellow passengers, but Dr. Harry is not interested and keeps playing bridge. Hitchcock on his part seems surprised to see that he has somehow been dealt a full suite of spades, a Grand Slam bridge hand.The plot centers around a bored teenager living in Santa Rosa, California, Charlotte \"Charlie\" Newton (Wright). She is frustrated because nothing seems to be happening in her life and that of her family. Then, she receives wonderful news: her uncle (for whom she was named), Charlie Oakley (Cotten), her mother's brother, is arriving for a visit.Two men show up pretending to be photographers and journalists working on a national survey of the average American family. One of them speaks to Charlie privately, identifying himself as Detective Jack Graham (Macdonald Carey) and telling her that her uncle is one of two men who are suspected of being a serial killer known as the \"Merry Widow Murderer\". This murderer has a modus operandi of seducing, murdering and robbing wealthy widows.Young Charlie at first refuses to even consider that her uncle could be a murderer, but she cannot help noticing him acting strangely on several occasions. She confirms her suspicions after seeing the initials on the engraving on the ring Uncle Charlie gave her match one of the recent victims of the killer. Particularly chilling is a family dinner conversation during which Uncle Charlie reveals his hatred of rich widows, comparing them to fat animals deserving of slaughter.Young Charlie's growing suspicion soon becomes apparent to her uncle. He confronts her and admits that he is indeed the man the police are after. He begs her for help; she reluctantly agrees not to say anything, as long as he leaves soon, to avoid a horrible scandal in the town that would destroy her family, especially her mother, who idolizes her younger brother.Then news breaks that the second suspect was killed fleeing from the police in Portland, Maine, and is assumed to have been the guilty one. The detective Graham leaves after telling Young Charlie that he loves her and would like to marry her someday. Uncle Charlie is delighted at first, until he remembers that Young Charlie fully knows his secret. Soon, the young woman has a couple of near fatal \"accidents\", falling down some very steep stairs at her home, and being trapped in a closed garage with a car spewing exhaust fumes.Uncle Charlie soon announces that he is leaving by train for San Francisco, following what is presumably his next victim. As he departs, he contrives for young Charlie to stay on board, planning to kill her by pushing her off as soon as the train gets up to speed. Instead, in the ensuing struggle between them, he falls into the path of an oncoming train. At his funeral Uncle Charlie is highly honored by the townspeople of Santa Rosa, who know nothing of his crimes. Jack has come back to comfort Charlie; she tells him she had withheld from him information about her uncle which would have confirmed him as the murderer, but Jack already knows and accepts that, realizing her difficult situation. They become a couple, and resolve to keep Uncle Charlie's crimes a secret.If you are looking for one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest masterpieces, do yourself a favor and watch SHADOW OF A DOUBT. It was by far one of the best movies of 1943, and one of the best movies of all time.",

Cousin Charlie adores her uncle until she begins to have doubts about who he really is. This is one of the four Hitchcock films that deals with duality. The others are Strangers on a Train, Psycho, and Frenzy. Hitchock exposes the dual nature of people through the use of doubling. Try to count all the instances of \"doubles\" in the film. The two Charlies; two detectives in Philadelphia, two detectives in Santa Rosa; two scenes on the train; Cotten orders a double shot in a bar; two scenes in the garage. The list goes on and on. This film rewards with repeated viewings.The acting in the film is top notch. Teresa Wright is perfect as the innocent girl who is exposed to the horrific world of her uncle. Joseph Cotten is terrific, understated but very creepy. Thorton Wilder's script is one of the best in all of Hitchcock's films.

So, perhaps this film is a time capsule of American culture in the 1940's. It is not an America that I've known all my life. My not being able to know if this is a bad script or an accurate reflection of our society back 70 years ago, makes me question how anyone can tell a movie's reality from the real reality.The other theme is the onset of war, as shown by headlines showing ToJo and seeing soldiers in the caf\u00e9's and bars. So, perhaps this is an allegory of our provincialism (everyone knows everyone's names) and niceness (people dropping by for dinner unannounced) being unknowing of the evil (Hitler/ToJo and Uncle Charlie) that lurks at our door. I was disappointed since it got 4 out of 4 stars on cable TV. Maybe it was a good movie \"for its time\" (that phrase is my knowing reference to the Bible which said Noah was a good man for his time \u2013 implying that after the discovery of religion, there were better men: \"Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time\" ).It is strange to see the Freudian hand gestures of Uncle Charlie move in a strangling motion when he sees his too knowledgeable niece. And Uncle Charlie's speech about fat, rich women was pretty bad \u2013 but (do I have to keep making explanations?) I guess it's similar to Jackie Gleason saying \"One day, Alice, to the moon\" being ignored for it anti-woman domestic violence.I'd say this is a period piece, and may be worthwhile in a way to understand the time and the director, but I would NOT recommend watching this in my era of 2014.",

There is also some brilliant comic relief: the father (Henry Travers) and a neighbour (Hume Cronyn), who are both fans of trashy crime novels, discussing how they would try to kill each other.

For example, the police suspicion that Joseph Cotten may be the Merry Widow Killer results in two of them visiting the family with whom he's staying so that they can pose as survey takers. This seems contrived and somewhat implausible. True, it may provide the basis for a sub-plot romance between Teresa Wright and Macdonald Carey but this sub-plot is unnecessary and besides, there's never any real ardor in this romance. Then there's the matter of the Uncle Charlie character. He's supposed to be one of those charmers whose appearance on the doorstep provokes delight on the part of his hosts. Yet he often comes across as a bad house-guest -- surly and even rude. That scene in the bank, for instance, when he loudly jokes about embezzlement and thus causes real embarrassment for his brother-in-law. What a boor! And if he's so smart, why does he give his niece a stolen ring which bears the engraved initials of its owner, one of his victims? Wouldn't he have checked over this ring first? And why try to hide the news item about the Merry Widow Killer by tearing it out of the newspaper? This only drew attention to the item whereas, if he left it alone, it would probably have passed without any special notice. On the other hand, I've always liked this movie's basic set-up, (though I could do with a bit less of the bookwormish kid sister), and it has a number of fine moments in it, such as when the camera pans down the Merry Widow newspaper article, line by line, as the Merry Widow Waltz plays ominously on the soundtrack.",

How many times do you have to be grabbed violently to only go back to walking along the street with suspected serial killer like nothing happened? Found the ring pretty quickly too though we never see where it was hidden (for a guy on the lam wasn't too careful, busy choking napkins and spouting off about uselessness of widows)$40,000 does not fit in your wallet or amount to a stack 1/2 high by the way in case you're wondering about credulity, Blaring orchestral violin music worthy of chase scene as we ascend the porch in to the house?

His low-key, controlled portrayal of a psychotic murderer, hiding out with \"mostly\" unsuspecting relatives, oozes dread and death. Hitchcock accomplishes this without gore, imaginations are much more detailed.  Murder is a necessity for Uncle Charlie, one for which he feels nothing.  Living in the \"sane\" world, he values no life, and I mean NO LIFE, but his own.This portrayal led me to other performances by Joseph Cotten.  Nontheless, it took an adjustment to forget his \"murderous\" past.  To show his range, I recommend \"LOVE LETTERS\" with Jennifer Jones.  From murderer to lover, totally believable in both.

As entertainment, it merits zero stars.The issue is that the plot's progress depends on all the clich\u00e9d players making the stupidest decisions at every inflection point. Here are two examples that, I think, avoid spoilers.The supposed tension consists of a family member's odd and doubly oddly unquestioned behavior that seems to leave him swimming in money but never questioned about its source. Is he a desperate criminal or fleeing from the police to the sole place in the world the police will look for him because he'd too idiotic to see that obvious flow in his escape plans?So once at the obvious hideout with an Andy Hardly style family, he sees a newspaper article that would, if he left it alone, would do nothing to create suspicion about him but he makes such a silly fuss that it ends up starting a chain of events that lead to further suspicion.In another dopey move, the neighborhood's comic relief is played by a 1940s version of an Incel who passes a detached garage clearly on fire where he hears a woman inside screaming and pounding the door hoping someone will hear and aid her escape. What does he do? He wanders into a nearby house and leisurely mentions the fire whereby the group assembles to attempt a rescue that leads to evidence destruction.

Yet with this is the contrast of a small town family reunion. The lauded closeness between the niece and uncle is kind of chilling with its undertone.The tension and sharp change in mode in restaurant scene near the end just grabs you by the throat and strangles the air out of it. Only part I didn't like was the melodramatic train ending. Give it maybe another 10 minutes - milk it with more suspense and maybe less dialogue, more glances.

As legendary as the Master of Suspense was, his pictures has never really hit the perfect note with me, but strangely he's still in the list of my Top 5 film-makers of all-time. I love all his films (especially Rear Window, and Psycho), but most of them are not serious heavyweights, or in other words, films that you have to be in the right frame of mind before viewing it. Shadow Of A Doubt is a typical Hitchcock feature, a mystery plot set in a small town that starts out like a lighted-hearted family show, but slowly becomes suspenseful.In the tradition of Dial M For Murder, and Rope, the villains are developed in such a manner that viewers tend to like them even though they are evil. Maybe that's what makes Hitchcock films so fascinating. There are engaging performances by the cast, with special mention given to Patricia Collinge (who plays the mother of the family). The ending is masterfully executed by Hitchcock, relying on close-up shots to make the 'struggle' sequence more frightening. This is said to be his favorite film, but it's by no means his best.SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",

            "content": "What I find interesting about the film is the young woman's existential situation: she's alone in her knowledge of who her Uncle really is and what he's doing. Even the detectives leave town at some point, leaving her alone with someone who wants to kill her, and she's the only one who knows it. She feels she has to protect her family, especially her mother, from knowledge of who her Uncle really is. I find this interesting in light of the year: 1943. The middle of the war, and the reports of the horrible atrocities of both the Nazis and the Japanese POW camps, but particularly of the new nature of war itself that had come to be for the world. It's like it's all impacting on her generation, and her parents are too nice, too peaceable and part of a far more protected and homespun world unaware of the evil \"out there\" and under the surface lurking even in people they love. (And even the science of the Unconscious was coming to the fore as the world witnessed the evil human beings were capable of on a colossal scale, not as a sideshow or outcome of war, but rather as the result of central planning. Meantime, at the finish of that war would be the introduction of nuclear weapons -- a whole new scale of planned destruction and deliberate evil aimed at masses of humanity.)I find in Shadow of a Doubt all of this dawning on this generation that fought that war and had to take knowledge of a world quite different from their parents', and that is the central role I see of the character of Charlie, alone with her knowledge, and with the knowledge of her own danger, who must fight her own battles and rely only on her own insights, wits, and intelligence to do so, and not the experience of her parents -- they're not prepared to cope with the knowledge of that kind of evil.I once heard a comment about Humphrey Bogart as a movie hero by Alistair Cooke. He explained that the great film hero of the 30s was Leslie Howard. But when the war and the Nazis came about, Leslie Howard and his image did not seem someone who could cope with Nazis. They needed tougher heroes, people who seemingly could cope with such evil, maybe having had a taste of the darker side of the law themselves. And so, Humphrey Bogart became the new face of the hero (especially with Casablanca, 1942), the type of hero necessary for the new time, the new menace, the new enemy.Makes you wonder about films and heroes of today a little, doesn't it? What does, for example, The Matrix say about what menaces us now?",

This is the tale of two Charlies, one good the other, bad.   There's Charlie Newton(Theresa Wright) the young woman, barely twenty who lives with her family in quaint, all-American Santa Rosa California and then there's her Uncle and namesake - Charlie Oakley (Joseph Cotton).   Charlie Oakley is the impossibly tall man who lives on the wrong side of the tracks back east.   Young Charlie Newton pines away in her idyllic home, waiting for adventure and romance while Uncle Charlie Oakley seems to have some trouble with detectives asking questions about him.  In the first of many telepathic coincidences, Young Charlie sets to send a telegram to her Uncle Charlie inviting him to visit while Uncle Charlie himself sends word that he will in fact be coming to Santa Rosa for a vacation.At last, the two Charlies are reunited.  Young Charlie and her entire family seem thrilled and charmed by Uncle Charlie.   Most happy to see him is Emma Newton, Young Charlie's mother who dotes on her handsome 'baby brother'. Even lonely next-door neighbor and aspiring murder mystery writer (Hume Cronyn) enjoys the bits of fun and wisdom the 'city slicker' brings to the table.    Just when Young Charlie is poised to 'show off' her favorite Uncle in town, she accidently stumbles upon some information and slowly realizes that Uncle Charlie might not be as nice as he seems.   This being a Hitchcock film naturally Uncle Charlie isn't just 'not nice' , he's what we would now a days call - a serial killer.  A tense game of cat and mouse begins as each Charlie realizes that the other is 'on to him'. Unfortunately for Young Charlie,  Uncle Charlie is much better at these games.There's a full, lushness to the Americana at work here that perhaps only script and story  collaborator Thornton Wilder could create.   The mixture of the penultimate writer of small town Americana - Our Town and the perverse sensibilities of Alfred Hitchcock is sublime.    The subtle camerawork and design reveals the shadows in the impeccable Victorian-style house and the garrulous, sit-com style sensibility of the Newton family is perfectly realized.   They seem instantly real and vulnerable to the unexpected violence brewing under their roof.     Slick, and almost comically fiendish, Shadow of A Doubt remains immensely potent, suprisingly sadistic and extremely entertaining.   Hitchcock is in top form as is fresh faced Theresa Wright as breezy Young Charlie and menacing, jaw clenching Joseph Cotton in one of his finest star turns here as her deadly Uncle.",

            "content": "It has been reported that Shadow of a Doubt was Alfred Hitchcock's favorite film from his oeuvre. While it's not my personal favorite of Hitchcock's films that I have seen (Psycho still rules supreme), I was rather struck by the power this film still holds more than fifty years after it's initial release.The centerpiece of this film is the character of \"Uncle Charlie\", portrayed by Joseph Cotton (famously just off of a role in Citizen Kane). He is on the lamb from some detectives tracking him, suspicious that he is the \"Merry Widow Strangler\", a man who charms wealthy widows and then kills them, taking their vast riches with him. Needing a place to hide out, Charlie decides to visit his older sister, Emma Newton (Patricia Collinge) in sunny Santa Rosa, California. There, he is greeted warmly by his sister's family, especially his niece, named Charlie (Teresa Wright), after him. However, it doesn't take long before Uncle Charlie begins to exhibit some strange behavior, ripping out stories in the newspaper, questioning the sudden appearance of some national surveyors who have seemingly coincidentally selected the Newton family for a subject of their survey, and becoming quite irate when individuals look into any of his belongings. When one of the surveyors, Jack Graham (MacDonald Carey), informs young Charlie that he is a detective who is on the trail of her Uncle, she at first doesn't believe him. But when Uncle Charlie becomes suspicious that she knows the truth, he beings to openly threaten her and suddenly the benevolent visitor becomes a palpable source of evil living in their otherwise average home.Hitchcock weaves a tale of menace living beneath a fa\u00e7ade of kindness and good-looks. Uncle Charlie is a romantic notion of what many of us would like in a family member: well-traveled, upbeat, well-off financially, adventurous. Charlie is quickly the talk of both the family and their immediate social circle after he arrives, invited to give speaking engagements in the small town and his sister is excited to have him there, reawakening memories of their happy childhood. Young Charlie is taken with him most, exuberant at his presence, believe he is the key to breaking her out of a malaise she has been feeling about \"average\" life. But Hitchcock quickly shows us the other side of Charlie. He snaps at younger Charlie and the rest of the family when he is concerned that he is being found out, going so far to grab Charlie's wrist when she finds a newspaper article in his jacket pocket. The film contains many scenes of idyllic small-town life before Charlie arrives to show what an ideal world exists there, a world that begins to show some cracks after his arrival.While he receives only second billing officially, this is Joseph Cotton's film all the way. It is reported that this is the only time in his career that he portrayed a heavy, and you wonder why he never gave it another try, because he is outstanding as Uncle Charlie. Cotton's normally cheerful and warm features disappear behind a visage of hate and menace often in the film, creating a chilling persona. Twice in the film, Hitchcock and screenwriters Thornton Wilder, Sally Benson and Alma Reville give Charlie speeches that reveal the hollow, misogynist core of this otherwise normal looking man. During one of the speeches at the family dinner table, the camera slowly zooms in until only Uncle Charlie's face fills the screen, as he mesmerizes the audience with his distaste for the world around him. He is a character who hates women, hates normal, average life, hates people in general and is only interested in his own well-being. When young Charlie defiantly stands against him, he begins plotting to do away with her, shattering whatever image we had up to that point of his good intentions.As with many of his other films, Hitchcock uses unique camera work to tell his story on occasion. This includes an early scene filmed from a high-angle, only to use this as a transition to a character observing others from the same angle, even after viewing the same character from the same perspective just a few moments before. But even more important, Hitchcock keeps the tension high as we watch events unspool, uncertain of where things are going next. In this respect, Shadow of a Doubt is no less accomplished than any modern thriller.Some aspects of this film have certainly dated (the rather prim and proper attitude to family life, for one), but it's still an amazing accomplishment to have stood the test of time. If you have any interest in a good thriller, Shadow of a Doubt is worth a look.",

It was made too early in Hitchcock's career. Had it come a decade later during his peak years, it would have been an easy fit with the rest of his 1950s masterpieces. What makes \"Shadow of a Doubt\" so special is the psychological dilemma, the differing viewpoints of each character, and the formal structure that adds balance and credibility. Hitchcock was so adept at drawing that fine line between good and evil. There are great subtle performances from the stars right down through the children. Though I'm not crazy about Joseph Cotten as a leading man, he does a fine job here. Fifteen years later, the role would have been a perfect fit for James Mason, Hitchcock's most suave villain (See \"North by Northwest\"). Filled with all the Hitchcock trademarks, like humor and suspense, \"Shadow of a Doubt\" is one of his finest films.",

            "content": "This is certainly my favorite Hitchcock (mmm\u0085'Strangers on a Train' comes pretty close too). It has so many great things going for it that I'm not even sure where to begin. For a film made such a long time ago, the way it holds up today speaks volumes about its power. I showed this film to my grandmother who, having never seen it, fell in love with the depiction of 40s small town life (the on-location shoot in Santa Rosa really made a difference here. It is in fact a character unto itself.). By the 40s, my grandmother was a schoolteacher/housewife living in Queens and by no means the teenager Charlie is in the movie. But I think for those looking to capture a fairly accurate glimpse of how people spent their time back then, this film will be of great interest. Here we see as world where teens are certainly not the entity they are now and are more or less treated as adults. Where people took to the streets at night for enjoyment with their friends and neighbors instead of sitting in front of TV or a computer. Where people lived a fairly contained, contented life in a place where the local cop might cut you a break just because he knows you.\nBut this ain't all Frank Capra, baby, it's Hitchcock, and he is definitely making a certain kind of statement about the small town America he found himself fascinated with when he arrived from his native London (this, I think, is his first real American made film). He manipulates us with this great, comfortable, familiar \u0096 and accurate! \u0096 American atmosphere and shows us something extremely sinister lying-in-wait through the arrival of Uncle Charlie (check out the dark shadow cast by the train carrying Charlie as it pulls in to Santa Rosa). In our modern terminology, I guess one could say that Hitch is showing a world that, while a very nice place, is blanketed in denial. The mother, played by Patricia Collinge, perhaps best personifies this notion to the point where she practically flat-out refuses to believe anything amiss could possibly be happening within her glorious household. She is hysterically happy in an almost forceful, even disturbing, way! For younger audiences, I think they will begin the movie with a preconceived Frank Capra-type expectation (which really seems old fashioned today), but slowly develop appreciation as these two worlds begin to collide. John Carpenter approached `Halloween' in much the same way: evil is a natural force in human nature that cannot be avoided or reasoned with no matter how hard one tries to act superior to it. Anyone who believes they can is merely deluding themselves. We often cannot control where or when it will enter and throw our lives asunder.   As for the players, they are entirely outstanding. Teresa Wright practically grows up before our eyes. Hume Cronyn provides intelligently fun comedic relief. Joseph Cotton is absolutely amazing as the heavy. His smirk reflects a cynicism and arrogance that attests to the hardships of the many dark corners of his world \u0096 the world Santa Rosa consciously shuts out. His negative energy would make him the perfect villain, but he's not an easy guy to hate. Just as his niece, Charlie, observes, we too find him dashing, charming, experienced, interesting and even friendly. By returning to Santa Rosa, we know that he's looking for something that has long been corrupted from his soul. We slowly realize that he can't ever truly return to his home, or what it represents for him, ever again. In that sense, Uncle Charlie is quite tragic. On the other hand, Hitch doesn't spare us of the evil lurking within, and Cotton's soliloquy at the dinner table is nothing short in awesome in giving us a peek inside the violent hatred fueling this serial killer.",

            "content": "A film of subtleties, Shadow of a Doubt is a slow moving character study of young \"Charlie\" (Teresa Wright), the namesake of sinister uncle, Charles Oakley (Joseph Cotton), formerly of Philadelphia, a man of dubious talents. Contrasting with the light and seemingly perfect Americana of 40s, middle class, small town Northern California, Uncle Charles is the shadow who comes into the lives of his sister's family. As young Charlie, Wright is an average but purposeless girl whose world has become boring largely by her failure to give it any meaning. She wants her uncle Charles to \"shake them up.\" However, she is part of a family where everyone talks over one another without heed, they present an assortment of conversations lost. The kids prattle, the mother/wife babbles, and the family's men persist in mindless discussions of how to plot murder effectively. Somehow, this connotes as the average family dynamic in Hitchcock's translation. This is a film of many dialogues but only one voice is heard without interruption, that of Uncle Charles. His monologue is the most menacing at the dinner table as he describes the \"silly wives,\" useless, fat, women whom he sees as less than human, faded, fat, greedy animals deserving to die. Young Charlie adores her uncle until the \"shadow of a doubt\" is placed in her mind by detective MacDonald Cary, one of two detectives on a national hunt for the \"Merry Widow\" serial murderer. Once the seeds of doubt are sown, however, young Charlie's dream of the perfect uncle and her perfect world are forever shattered. Uncle Charles rips away at ordinary Charlie, her sleepwalking innocence forcing her to see the warped world he has experienced. The real world is not a nice place and Charlie attempts to shield her simplistic family from the evil under their roof becomes her responsibility for she has ultimately summoned the devil to their door. Will she keep the family ignorant of Uncle Charles murderous past but at a cost to her own happiness?Hitchcock acknowledged the film was his personal favorite and it defines the idea of suspense, noir, and thriller without blood or visual carnage. A literate script by Thorton Wilder (Our Town) alludes to all the violence that is only suggested but never seen, and through the physical presence of the brilliant character actor, Joseph Cotton, the menace and diabolic threat to the virginal Theresa Wright is alluded to in eye, body language, and hands. Sophisticated and cerebral, Hitch was playing with the audience by creating a masterpiece of normality and averageness through the evil veneer of a sophisticated character versus the idealized characters of small town America.",

Such as one the shot tightens up when Uncle Charlie tells something about the widows in the dinner table scene. And like typical Hitchcock, there's always some beautiful mobile framing every now and again in the movie. Was fascinating to see the transition to how jolly young Teresa Wright suddenly becomes stricken and perturbed when she finds out about Uncle Charles.The most frightening scene is the one in the end inside the train and its the final payoff of HOW Uncle Charles murders his victims and the kind of man he has really always been.I hear this is one of Hitchcock's underrated films and I wonder why one called NOTORIOUS inferior to this one. By the way it was the Merry Widow waltz and at the time of this movie, it needed no explanation.Yeah, I only send telegrams the normal way.Grade A+",

The suspense throughout is nicely measured, slowly and surely keeping you on the edge of your seat. Joseph Cotton is marvellously villanious as Uncle Charlie and Teresa Wright is great as younger niece Charlie. The supporting cast is fantastic too, especially the actress who plays percocious little Anne the bookworm and the actor who plays the father: the expressions on his face at various points in the movie are hilarious. All in all, not the most famous Hitchcock - but nevertheless one of the best, and can certainly hold its own against the master's more well-known works.",

            "content": "\"Shadow of a Doubt\" is a one of a kind film by Hitchcock.  It separates itself from his standard formula, in one notable way.  Rather than the usually theme of an ordinary man trapped in an extraordinary situation, Hitchcock presents the main character as a villain, something he did in only one other film, one of his most well known ones at that.A man living in the city (Joseph Cotten) comes to a small town to live with his sister and her family.  His niece (Teresa Wright) feels she has an abnormally strong connection with him - in fact, there almost seems to be a sort of love interest between them, whether it be intentional or not.  She slowly grows to realize that he is a serial killer, and the story builds from that.\"Shadow of a Doubt\" shares the same technical and visual style that has made Hitchcock arguably the most important man ever to direct a movie.  As usual, he is able to bring excellent performances from his actors, most notably Cotten, who is perfect as the evil yet likeable uncle, and Wright, the naive young girl who slowly catches on.The performance of Cotten is important because Hitchcock's films usually feature a character that the viewer can relate to.  Cotten presents a character who, despite the fact that he is a serial killer, still makes the audience like him and sympathize with him.  This is similar to \"Psycho\" and Anthony Perkins.  \"Shadow of a Doubt\" succeeds in doing this because of three things - the excellent screenplay, Hitchcock's direction, and Cotten's performance.Despite the fact that this movie contains fewer great suspenseful action scenes than most Hitchcock movies, the storyline and the acting are as good as they have ever been.  It succeeds in all of its fundamentals, and most Hitchcock buffs will rate it as one of his best.**** out of ****",

It's been a while since I've seen the film, but my recollection is that the cop understands this and that his courtship of her starts out with very mixed motives. The Production Code kept all this well below the surface.If Shadow of a Doubt were to be remade, this triangle would probably be more explicit.  If it had been remade, say, 15 years ago it would have been very explicit.  These days, though, the niece couldn't be played as plausibly naive about her feelings for her uncle if older than 15 or 16, which would complicate her relationship to the detective.",

What makes this film utterly interesting, is the ambiguity of the relationship of the two main protagonists, young Charlie (Teresa Wright) and her uncle Charles (Joseph Cotten). The swinger seems to epitomize the dark side of the charming girl, a motif of romantic (and Victorian?) tradition Hitchcock refers to again and again. Between both there is also a latently incestuous conjunction: Charlie is as excited as a lover before and while the uncle arrives; later, he gives her a (stolen) ring, as if she was his fianc\u00e9.As Truffaut and other critics already commented, the dichotomy of the Charlie/Charles-character is specified in the dual structure of the whole film: There are two policemen in the East and two in the West, two sought criminals and two private detectives, two doctors and two siblings, two scenes at the train station and two in the garage, two scenes in front of the church and two at dinner etc",

            "content": "In \"Shadow of a Doubt\", Alfred Hitchcock takes the action to Main Street USA. To understand this movie as it was meant to affect the average viewer, just read an old 1940s newspaper on microfilm. The advertisements speak with almost surreal frequency of the typical American family, this nonexistent ideal that so many people felt as if they should be striving to be.This typical family ideal was very powerful, and to question it had a power that it simply doesn't today. This movie is essentially a challenge to that ideal, albeit a charmingly clumsy challenge that was all Hollywood could muster at the time. This movie doesn't say that race relations or an evolving economy or lifestyle-altering technology is a threat to the typical American family, but simply that evil, uncaring people are the threat.We are presented with a family that, despite its protestations, is told by a national survey team that they are the typical American family. Indeed the family is off-kilter, but nevertheless Hitchcock intends them as a typical family, if geared toward being audience-pleasing with all their quirks.Their peaceful \"typical\" life is interrupted when \"Uncle Charlie\" comes for a visit. The abrasive city-dweller with many secrets and detectives in tow makes very explicit the threat he represents, telling his namesake niece \"You go through your ordinary little day, and at night you sleep your untroubled ordinary little sleep, filled with peaceful stupid dreams. And I brought you nightmares.\" The suspense in this movie isn't Uncle Charlie's dark past and what he'll do to avoid capture, but, in the context of 1943 America, it must have meant to be shocking that a nihilistic self-loathing man capable of murder without any qualms could be coming to a pleasant, picture-perfect small town USA. The scare here for the original audiences was an attack on \"ordinary America\".\"Shadow of a Doubt\" shows us a pleasant world of (white) people cheerfully walking on sidewalks, being helped along by the kindly policeman and hurrying home to dinner with their idealized families, and asks us to imagine that being under attack. While the threat to \"Ordinary America\" didn't end up being evil uncles, it's still a powerful movie about the fear of change.Stylistically, it is full of wonderful angles and exciting, by-the-books suspense building. I personally don't feel it's the top-tier classic many do, there's far too much formula and clich\u00e9 and not a great deal of truly original concepts, but it's still a worthwhile movie to see.",

            "content": "Alfred Hitchcock preferred to shoot his films on Universal Picture's major sound stage. The \"Master of Suspense\" was a perfectionist, and wanted total control over his products. But now it was 1943. World War ll was raging, and the US War Production Board restricted the cost of set constructions. So to save money the director decided to make \"Shadow of a Doubt\" on location instead.In the movie a young woman lives in a small, South Californian town. One day an older relative comes to visit. But it soon turns out that Uncle Charlie carries a deep, dark secret. The kind of confidential information that would be highly dangerous to reveal.Hitchcock had a hit the year before with \"Saboteur\". That film was a large-scale overview of modern America. A movie that traveled from California to New York, where it ended up in the Statue of Liberty in one of the director's most spectacular set-pieces ever. Now Hitchcock wanted to try something else. Focus his sharp gaze on one single family, in one single town.Before Hitchcock made \"Shadow of a Doubt\", he had often alternated between spy stories such as \"Saboteur\" and tales about domestic violence such as \"Rebecca\". The genius here is that the director effectively mixed the two ingredients. He presented a family circle whose members slowly turn their home into a living hell through their compulsion to spy on each other.Sadly, \"Shadow of a Doubt\" was a box-office failure. Nevertheless, Hitchcock used a similar structure in several, much better known, films. Just think of modern classics like \"Rear Window\", \"Vertigo\" and \"Psycho\" for example. But although those movies made significantly more money than \"Shadow of a Doubt\", that little film still remained the director's own, personal favorite.",

The family are pleased to see him especially his niece,who is also named Charlie,everything seems perfect.Until young Charlie{Teresa Wright}discovers her uncle is a serial killer,and the police are on to him. Because she doesn't want her family dragged into his arrest she urges her uncle to leave,but he has other plans and sets out to silence her.Towards the end of the film he lets his niece think that she has won the argument and decides to leave but insists young Charlie says her goodbyes to him on the train. His plan is to wait until the train starts moving fast and then push her off.But his plan backfires and it is he who falls from the train to his death.Shadow of a Doubt is very good for a 1942 film,the script is good and the acting is realistic.There is also some funny moments between young Charlies father Joe and his friend Herbert,who in their spare time like to discuss the perfect way to commit murder and get away with it. Also others may disagree but Teresa Wrights character is probably my favourite of the Hitchcock women,as shes different to the usual Hitchcock cool blonde's,in that shes playing a typical average young woman who's intelligent but naive,but at the same time very plucky and has the courage to stand up to her uncle,and eventually put an end to him.More than sixty years on this is still a very watchable film.",

Indeed, Wright is just off the set from her Mrs. Miniver performance. The virginal attitudes, the very real naivet\u00e9 of 1940's small town, middle class girlhood never to be seen again, contrasts with the, ah, insertion of evil.Uncle Charlie shows up, the beloved, world traveling, younger brother of weepy mom.

Hence, a confusing romance ensues, but can she give the detective information on her mother's favorite.

The town of Santa Rosa literally pulls all the stops for the fat man. In those days, folks lived a block from the town business center. This is the same area where today there are crumbling buildings and high crime rates.

            "content": "Out of all of the films that he made during his career, Alfred Hitchcock cited this effort from 1943 as his personal favorite. As a result, some might tend to go in with extremely high expectations. And while there is the possibility that they might be disappointed by it, there's also the possibility that they may come to view it as another masterpiece from the \"Master Of Suspense\", which fortunately, is how a majority of viewers usually see it.As for myself, I can perfectly see why Hitchcock viewed this as his favorite film, because it's, quite frankly, stupendous. It's a thrilling film that perfectly showcases all of Hitchcock's signature elements. However, it's also one of his most interesting for the fact that it involves a rather novel aspect, because it doesn't really have much involvement from any outside forces (apart from the detectives), with most of the suspense coming from within the family. Furthermore, it shows how something so idyllic can turn into something very nightmarish.The film is the story of a teenage girl named Charlotte Newton, who lives with her family in a rather quiet town in California. One day, her family receives a visit from her uncle, Charles Oakley. Charlotte is positively overjoyed to see him, who she absolutely adores. At first, everything seems idyllic, but before long, things turn very ominous, which involves Charles beginning to behave in a weird manner, sometimes becoming violent tempered. When Charlotte begins to have reasons to suspect that her beloved \"Uncle Charlie\" is actually a serial killer. However, she puts herself in danger when her Uncle becomes suspicious in regards to whether or not she's aware of what he may have done. In the process, Hitchcock transforms what would initially seem to be a routine thriller into a very deep study of a family, and it's one that manages to keep the audience engaged throughout its length.In regards to the film, Hitchcock at one point said that his intention was to \"bring violence back into the home\", and it would be an understatement to say that he more than succeeded in doing such an objective, in which he allows a rather idyllic setting to take place involving the family, and then allows the darker elements to arrive. The film primarily focuses on the relationship between Charlotte and her uncle, which initially starts out as being genuinely moving and heartwarming, but as more secrets come to light, the rather dreamy atmosphere soon turns into a nightmare for Charlotte as she struggles to comes to terms with what her Uncle has done, in which she tries to cover for him even when it's becoming apparent that he's done something rather grizzly. Hitchcock also utilizes some rather impressive techniques, through the use of first person and close ups, which manage to add to the nightmarish aspects. One moment involves \"Uncle Charlie\" seeing his niece read a newspaper, and he rather menacingly snatches the paper, and then briefly looks directly at the camera. There are also a few scenes involving Charlotte walking down a street and towards the camera, with her Uncle following her on some occasions. Considering the way Hitchcock handled such techniques, one would assume that the characters are looking and moving directly towards the viewer.Furthermore, the story is bolstered by some absolutely brilliant acting. Teresa Wright is sublime, in which she perfectly handles Charlotte's several transitions throughout the film, in which she starts off with a childlike sense of innocence before moving towards a nightmare sense of skepticism as she finds out more about her uncle. Joseph Cotton was incredible, bring a sense of charm and politeness to his role as \"Uncle Charlie.\" Cotton was unnerving with how he played the character, in which he plays him with a touch of politeness that makes he feel like the perfect Uncle, yet all the while, be brings a sense of ominousness and dread that shows that there's darkness that lurks around him, even when he doesn't do anything wrong. While the film primarily focuses on the relationship between Charlotte and her Uncle, the supporting characters also make significant contributions to the story. Macdonald Carey was great as one of the detectives who is on the trail of the \"Merry Widow Killer\", and Edna May great effort as Charlotte's younger sister, which made for one of the more effective efforts from a child actor I've seen in any film. There's also some comic relief in the form of Henry Travers and Hume Cronye, however, neither of their characters seem forced and unnatural. It's a further testament to Hitchcock's mastery as a director that he could make even the lesser characters make a big contribution to the film, as everyone contributed, with Wright and Cotton being the two major standouts.To reiterate, it's easy to understand why Hitchcock considered this to be his favorite out of all of the film he directed, because it's about as perfect as most Hitchcock films can get. By the way, it's also interesting to point out that Hitchcock's signature cameo involves him hold the cards, which was very appropriate, because as mentioned before, this film contains all of his signature elements, all of which worked in his favor to the fullest. Ultimately, Shadow Of A Doubt is one Hitchcock film that shouldn't be overlooked, as it's a suspense film that has definitely earned its place as one of the best in the genre, as well as one of Hitchcock's finest efforts.",

You can see the soldiers here and there, but you really wouldn't know that a war and mass murder is going on in the world at large. World War II is not mentioned. Santa Rosa and America herself look so pristine, clean, and, if the scenes from the film are looked at from a qualitative point of view, a higher standard of living exists than at present. Who cares if the trains are pulled by steam engines. At least, there is a bloody train running from Santa Rosa to Frisco. Yes, the air is clean and the people look happier and treat each other decently....except of course, Uncle Charlie.Crazy Charlie (Joseph Cotten), the serial killer and part-time uncle, looks dapper as, I suspect, many serial killers do. And Teresa (Young Charlie) Wright...is she really a 25 year old playing a seventeen year old who has nothing but innocent bones in her body...well, until she discovers the truth about Uncle Charlie. When, half way through the movie, she moves from worshiping belief, to \"a shadow of a doubt\" and then to CONVICTION about Uncle Charlie, she too threatens murder. You can see it in her eyes! She tells her misogynist Uncle Charlie, to his face that she will kill him, if he doesn't leave town.Is this what happens to the innocence of America herself, confronted by Hitlerian madness, egged on by the arrogance of Japanese Imperial aggression? To be condemned and contaminated by mass murder? Alfred Hitchcock knew. He went to his grave with the answer, unless of course, you can figure it out from his work.By the way, a nice bed of naivet\u00e9 Charlie's family makes for the detectives, who lie their way into the household to get their man. They lie about being government men, on a socially scientific expedition to find and interview and eventually, to publicly display a \"typical American family\" for America herself to see and revel in. After all, these are hard (WWII) times\u0096only hinted at. Come on. It's 1943 when people see this film! Of course, the nice \"g-men\" get the co-operation they came for and of course they violate innocent trust WHILE missing their man. Innocent trust, you say? Think citizens, think : about your attitude to the current \"Patriot Act\".Advantages will be taken of the naive. This is Cotten-Charlie's message...and he's psychotic! Uncle Charlie takes advantage of naive, rich widows. He kills them and takes their money. Is he wrong? Depends. Are you a psychotic misogynist? What will happen to the innocence of America? Look at Young Charlie. What does she say? What does she do? And the minor subplot of the Young Charlie Newton's father (Henry Travers) and his friend (Hume Cronyn), reading mystery stories, while fantasizing perfect murders of their own, perfection to a tee. After all, what can a poor pop do? There's no television in 1943 Santa Rosa. One can only spend one's free-time talking to one's friends. Hell, the kids have no cell phones! And the mother, what does she do? Cook? How un-hip. She actually spends her labour time making meals from scratch and keeping the rather enormous house which accrues from the wages of her bank-clerk husband, tidy and pleasantly adorned.",

However, this is one of Hitchcock's least cinematically interesting films of his American period; it seems he was so tickled by the material that he felt he didn't need to invest his inventive stylistic flourishes into the story. Granted, there are some choice touches: the extradiagetic transitional ballroom dance is haunting, and the easy supernaturality of Uncle Charlie's ability to evade capture is masterfully, subtly conveyed. Perhaps it's shallow of me to yearn for a big set-piece or two, but Hitchcock's set-pieces always did more than merely entertainingly punctuate his narratives; they enriched the meanings of his works on a surrealistically psychological level.

Let it be known that it has changed with my screening of \"Shadow of a Doubt,\" a Hitchcock masterpiece of humor and suspense.Teresa Wright plays Young Charlie Newton, a pretty, vulnerable girl who thinks her family can be \"reawakened,\" if you will, if her dear Uncle Charlie (played excellently by stage theater veteran Joseph Cotten) comes for a visit. He does, but there may be more to \"dear old Uncle Charlie\" than meets the eye, much more.If you're interested, I've finally completed my top ten Hitchcock films list. It reads: #10. \"Rope\"; #9. \"Frenzy\";  #8. \"The Birds\"; #7. (tie) both version of \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\"; 5. \"Psycho\"; 4. \"Shadow of a Doubt\"; 3. \"Strangers on a Train\"; 2. \"Vertigo\"; 1. \"Rear Window.\"And once again, \"Shadow of a Doubt\" is definitely a film, along with those other Hitchcock masterpieces, to add to the favorites. Rated PG. 120 minutes. 10 out of 10.",

It was great to be young then.\"Uncle Charlie (while joking about embezzlement & the bank president): \"$40,000 is no joke. Not to him, I bet. It's a joke to me. The whole world's a joke to me.\"Uncle Charlie: \"Women keep busy in towns like this. In the cities it's different. The cities are full of women. Middle aged widows. Husbands dead. Husbands who've spent their lives making fortunes. Working and working. Then they die and leave their money to their wives. Their silly wives. What do these wives do, these useless women? You see them in the hotels. The best hotels every day by the thousands. Drinking the money. Eating the money. Losing their money at bridge. Playing all day and all night. Smelling of money. Proud of their jewelry but of nothing else. Horrible, faded, fat, greedy women.\" Charlie: \"But they're alive. They're human beings.\" Uncle Charlie: \"Are they? Are they, Charlie? Are they human or are they fat, wheezing animals? Huh? What happens to animals when they get fat and too old?\"Uncle Charlie: \"How do you know what the world is like? Do you know the world's a fat sty? Do you know if you rip the fronts off houses you'd find swine? The world's a hell. What does it matter what happens in it?\"Charlie: \"He thought the world was a horrible place. Couldn't have been very happy ever. He didn't trust people. He seemed to hate them. Hated the whole world.\"In other words: Everybody's out to screw you, so you'd better screw them first. Isn't that what many people think today?",

But I think what makes this movie so creepy, and in a Hitchcockian way, so subversive, is the juxtaposition of the image of sunny, happy small-town America and insensate, predatory violence.  I'm no film historian, so I can't comment on war-time mentality or place this all in context.  I also don't think Hitchcock was slamming us with any specific social criticism.  It's just a shadow of a doubt about human nature, and what we believe about others.  And that subtlety is why it's such an effective film.",

This actually makes the film more interesting and makes it more suspenseful.The main psychological theme, which was really ground breaking for 1943, is the strange relationship between 16 year old Charlie and her uncle Charlie (the niece is named after uncle). At first it seems like Charlie is in love with her uncle. Later she is informed he might be a murderer. At first she does not believe it ,but than the doubt kicks in. Then the relationship eventually changes to a murderous one. This psychological development and initial deviance makes this film in my opinion the first sophisticated psycholigical thriller. An excellent performance by Teresa Wright.Also very good are the alienating scenes of the dialogues between the average family man type father and the neighbor Herbie about how they would kill each other.Joseph Cotton's performance in scenes such at the paper house building and the diners is amazing too.The film actually having been filmed in Santa Rosa, which was rare at the time, gives the film an excellent ambience.All in all, still one of the best psychological thrillers, if not the best, ever made, a 10/10.",

            "content": "\"Shadow of a Doubt\" is one of my favorite Hitchcock films, but it wasn't always so. The first time I saw it I was very surprised by the number of \"leaps in narrative\": 1. We are never shown Charles Oakley strangling his victims. 2. The initial connection between the Niece & the Uncle is not made all that clear, or why he is coming to Santa Rosa. (By the way, her formal name is apparently Charlotte, although this is never mentioned in the film; I read it somewhere else). 3. It's never explained how the Uncle managed to accumulate such a vast amount of money so easily.(That was a lot of money in the 1940's!) 4. It seems silly for the Uncle to give his Niece a stolen ring from one of his victims. 5. The two detectives posing as reporters, and just inviting themselves in without being asked for any credentials, seemed a \"bit of a stretch\". 6. The too convenient plot involving two suspects, so that the Uncle could have an alibi. 7. We don't see the Uncle make his famous speech, so we aren't shown that supposed side of his personality. 8. And finally...how in the world would the Niece explain the Uncle's death in a satisfactory manner, without admitting the truth? And even if she could, wouldn't the news kill her mother anyway...?In any case...after multiple viewings you forget all that, and just concentrate on the interesting historical view of small town America of the 1940's, and the sharply etched characters. The whole cast is excellent and a wonder to watch. Intended to be a subtle reminder to the public that evil exists in the world, and has to be confronted and dealt with. Exactly the message that was needed in the middle of WWII!Trivia: Only the (Newton) house on McDonald Avenue, the railroad station, and the clock tower seen in downtown views still exist. Santa Rosa has changed completely in 60+ years...!Oh...one more thing: it could have used a better music score. Dimitri Tiomkin would later do a lot of good scores for Hitchcock, but unfortunately this was not one of them. Overly dramatic and somewhat tedious in places. Apparently, Hitchcock was actually trying to get Bernard Herrmann, but just could not for some reason. Now that would have been very, very interesting...!",

            "review_title": "Understanding Uncle Charlie In \"Shadow of A Doubt\"",
            "content": "Of all the comments about this intriguing film, only one that I read mentioned the accident Charles Oakley had as a boy: he was struck by a streetcar, and nearly killed. When he emerged from his coma days later, he was changed somehow, and never again the same person he had been, according to an elder female relative.This is the type of detail that another writer than Thornton Wilder, or another director than Alfred Hitchcock, might have glossed over. But both of them had an uncanny sense of how things work in reality, and I believe it is this which lends an air of verisimilitude even to their most outlandish story premise. History tells of people who were injured in the frontal area of the brain, and how their character changed afterward: they felt no more empathy, love or remorse; only greed, fear, suspicion and anger, with joy only visiting their lives when they \"won\" some contest or struggle against another person. Modern science finds that the Conscience seems to reside in that part of the brain, and to \"leak out\" when the area is injured, leaving the recovering patient a functional sociopath.Unlike some of those who have commented, I found Charles Oakley a very believable character. Unfortunately, I knew a sociopath personally (not a serial killer, as far as I know! just manipulative and extremely selfish), and he was charming and likable - until he was crossed. His family knew all about him, yet even so could be lulled by his wheedling and flattery into believing his lies \"just this once.\" Normal people WANT to believe there's good in everyone, and the sociopath takes advantage of that to manipulate them. Once the sociopath knows you're on to him (or her), however, and won't be fooled by him anymore, the mask drops and he shows his true nature. That's when things start to get nasty.That is what we see happening in \"Shadow of A Doubt.\" Charles is quickly able to convince the whole town of what a great guy he is, and even with his little slips and gaffes - like his outrageously cynical banter with his brother-in-law at the bank - people overlook such \"aberrations\" and make excuses for him, because they want to believe in him. The children in the story, however, are less set in their ways. Like children in reality, they take people as they find them, and are quick to wise up about \"Good Old Uncle Charlie,\" even though the younger two never seem to be aware of the full extent of his evil. It's very clear to them that there is something wrong with him, but everyone else is in nearly complete denial, and in a kind of role reversal, the children want to protect the adults' peace of mind. Young Charlie and her younger siblings want to protect their mother from finding out what a monster her beloved younger brother has become (or perhaps they are only stoic about the unlikelihood of her believing anything they might say against him). Unfortunately, his death is the only thing that allows her to maintain her cherished illusions about her brother.",

Charlie gets spooked and goes on the run. He calls his sister and to let her know he's stopping by. After he arrives his niece Charlie Newton (Teresa Wright) and him are really close off the jump. She does find out he has a secret after he cuts out a piece of the newspaper. Soon the two investigator who had come before come to The Newton household. Charlie Newton protects her uncle. Jack Graham (Macdonald Carey) one of the agents befriends Charlie and takes her out. She figures out he's an investigator. Jack explains what he's looking for in her uncle and Charlie goes to the library to figure out what her uncle has done. Charlie and Charlies relationship gets cold after that. Soon after the other man who was a suspect gets caught although Charlie had done the crime. Jack gets close with Charlie Newton and that spooks uncle Charlie. Before he was supposed to give a speech Charlie tries to kill Charlie. She survives with a new found intent to snitch, uncle Charlie then plans to flee town. The overreaction by charlies mother convinces her not snitch. As Charlie is leaving he tries to kill Charlie but with supreme grappling little Charlie pushes uncle Charlie of a training he dies. The movie ends at his Funeral.Shadow of Doubt kept you on your toes through the whole film. The first scene we are introduced to Charlie its clear he had done something horrible. Then for the investigators to follow him to the newton house added to the suspicion. Thought the whole film you think is he gonna get caught will Charlie help him or the police. When he's supposedly in the clear he tries to kill his niece and she doesn't die you assume one of them has to fall and just when everything seems almost ok uncle Charlie is killed when he was supposed to be the killer. These events kept you engaged even after the initial blow was landed. Also they gave a feeling of justice. This movie did a great job of swaying momentum in between the two main characters by how the side characters reacted towards them. The initial problem succeeded by a second bigger problem is a typical aspect in a Hitcock Film. One of the best films to follow this type of directing.",

            "content": "One of the major themes of this film is the reoccurrence of the issue of identity. Uncle Charlie has multiple identities that he only shows to certain people. In the home of his sister, Charlie attempts to have the identity of the perfect brother and visitor. To his niece, young Charlie, he must show the second side of his personality: the murderer. Young Charlie also has to show two different identities: the calm side of being a loving and devoted daughter and the troubled side where she knows Uncle Charlie's secret. She struggles with the issue of turning her uncle in for murder or saving her mother's heart by not telling. Identity of the suburban town versus the gritty city also shows the contrast between good and evil. Identity is definitely a reoccurring theme in this film. Identity also occurs often in 'North by Northwest\" and \"The Lady Vanishes.\"This theme is shown in two major scenes as well as many others. The first is when Uncle Charlie gives young Charlie the emerald ring. The ring was stolen from one of his merry widow victims. The giving of the ring mimics a wedding proposal, indicating trust and devotion. The ring itself represents murder and the dark side of Uncle Charlie. Another scene is when Uncle Charlie is in bed and the mother and young Charlie are talking about being photographed for the paper. Photos usually represent certain times and image. Charlie looks at photos differently because he is a murderer. He does not want his identity to be shown for fear that he could be recognized and caught.There are two film techniques that are also very apparent in \"Shadow of a Doubt.\" The first and major one is the reoccurrence of music. The song that is played the most is the 'Merry Widow Waltz.' The title of the waltz in relation to the film is obvious; Charlie is called the 'Merry Widow Murderer.' The song for some reason keeps on popping into young Charlie's head during the first dinner scene. When she tries to remember the name and mentions the name 'merry' Uncle Charlie suddenly spills a glass of wine, showing that he does not want her to make the connection between the waltz and the title. Dialogue is the other film technique that keeps on showing up. The way that Uncle Charlie and young Charlie talk together is very unique. They constantly say each other's names, making all of the actions very personal. Young Charlie also mentions to her Uncle in the kitchen scene during the first night that they have some sort of telepathy. This would be dialogue in their heads, versus out loud. She feels that they are connected, yet she also knows that there is a secret that her uncle is hiding. The connection between the two characters is apparent through dialogue, spoken or unspoken.",

            "content": "You know, I don't necessarily like being told something is a \"classic\" until I finally see it for myself and judge it on its merits. I don't want to base my opinion on what some swarthy critic condescendingly tells me what makes the film so great, worthwhile ... classic. So, while I was watching \"Shadow Of A Doubt,\" I really tried to retain that in the back of my mind. First of all ... I think \"Shadow Of A Doubt\" IS a classic. Alfred Hitchcock's name-sake alone makes this film worthwhile. Maybe I am channeling more than just a few critics, here, but even Hitchcock's lesser films have flourishes of masterful cinematic technique. \"Shadow Of A Doubt\" is certainly NOT one of those films, however. There's more than enough, here, to place it on the same shelf as \"Rear Window,\" and \"The 39 Steps.\" Here, in his first American film, Hitchcock whittles out an excellent story of deceit, suspicion, and outright terror. One that plunges us, the viewer, deep into its guts. Joseph Cotton plays Charlie, a man whose mysterious criminal past prompts him to flee for California, where his sister, nieces and nephews reside. As he arrives, his niece Charlie (Teresa Wright) greets him with love and more than just a little hero-worship. And yet, after a firm warning from a police investigator, she begins to suspect that her uncle may, in fact, be a vicious killer who has sought asylum in her mother's home. As the tension slowly rises, Charlie's mistrust gives way to bone-chilling terror. And we, as the audience, question everything that we/she sees until the surprising finale. You know ... my only real complaint about \"Shadow Of A Doubt\" is its dawdling pace. Hitchcock takes WAY too much time establishing each character. He's a master filmmaker, but the suspense really didn't add up until well after the mid-way point of the movie. And while I enjoyed the development and the fine writing, some of it becomes moot at the very end. But ... lingering for the climax was well worth the admission price. Besides, Joesph Cotton is pure gold, here. When, at the dinner table, he begins a sort of silent but deadly tirade about widowed women, frivolously squandering their husbands' money, Hitchcock's camera reluctantly pushing in to Cotton's face. \"Are they human or are they fat, wheezing animals, hmm,\" asks Cotton. \"And what happens to animals when they get too fat and too old?\" I don't know where this seething hatred originates ... but it's enough to evoke a nightmare or two. Cotton does it quite well. He knows how to dominate the screen without appearing to even try. He's strikingly handsome, but not pretty enough to be your average dispassionate Hollywood heart-throb. He had the look of an everyman, who only happened to know are really great tailor. I think that \"Shadow Of A Doubt\" indeed is a classic. It's slow to start ... but it finishes very well, under Hitchcock's knowing eye. Also ... check out Joseph Cotton in one of my favorites, \"The Third Man.\"",

            "content": "Alfred Hitchcock's \"Shadow of a Doubt\" might be the most stately, elegant serial killer movie ever made. It stands with \"Silence of the Lambs\", \"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer\" and another of Hitchcock's masterpieces, \"Psycho\", as a film that elevates the thriller genre into art. It's one of Hitchcock's best movies, and one of the best movies in the murder thriller genre.Charlie Newton (Teresa Wright) is a small-town teenager who dreams of a big, exciting life in the big, exciting city. When her Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten), for whom she was named and for whom she feels a mystical connection that only a teenage girl can feel, comes to visit, she follows him around like a lovesick puppy - and finds out that he is a serial killer of elderly widows. Suddenly, the adventure has become a bit too grown-up, especially when Uncle Charlie decides that his favorite niece may have to be his next victim.This is one of Hitchcock's darkest movies, especially considering the time in which he made it. \"Shadow of a Doubt\" was released in 1943, a time when American movies felt they had a duty to be plucky, sweet and optimistic - there was a war on, after all, and the folks back home needed cheering up. With this movie, Hitchcock turns that optimism on its head: Human evil at its worst takes root in Anytown, USA, and flourishes. \"The world's a hell, Charlie,\" Uncle Charlie says. \"What does it matter what happens in it?\" Try finding a line like that in a Ronald Reagan movie.Cotten is perfect as Uncle Charlie, playing him as a monster disguised as a person. Beneath his charm, he is missing a basic element of a human being - a conscience, a soul - and it is getting harder and harder for him to cover it up. There's a desperate hollowness in his eyes as he smiles and makes nice, as if the strain of keeping his homicidal urges under control is eating away at him. There's a wonderful scene where he lets the mask slip during a family dinner: His eyes go dead and his voice flattens as he delivers a chilling monologue comparing old women to animals ready for slaughter. For a brief moment, we see him for what he really is, and it's terrifying.Wright seems callow as Young Charlie, which is right for the part - she is just learning that the world isn't always such a peachy keen place. Hume Cronyn is funny as the Newtons' weird neighbor, an amateur criminologist who likes to muse about the perfect murder, unaware that he is sitting right next to an expert in the field. Patricia Collinge as Young Charlie's mother is charmingly clueless about her brother, as well as the world around her. MacDonald Carey plays the detective following Uncle Charlie, who develops an interest in Young Charlie that is almost as creepy as what her uncle is accused of doing.Hitchcock was the Master of Suspense for a reason - he could make you feel afraid without knowing why. \"Shadow of a Doubt\" oozes creepy atmosphere, playing to the kind of fear you can't quite put your finger on, as if something horrible is lurking just out of view. It's a great thriller, and a masterpiece of anxiety.",

The characters are most likable with an extraordinary cast. Joseph Cotten is at his best as the seemingly devoted Uncle Charlie that hides an evil secret.   Teresa Wright is most effective as the intelligent but unaware niece in this \"average\" American Family.  She soon becomes a threat to Cotten's character and thus is in jeopardy herself.  The \"murder\" games between the characters played by Hume Cronyn and Joseph Newton add hilarity and a bit of irony to the plot.  The entire family's characters are portrayed with ease without over acting.

            "content": "You can view this as a good mystery story (which I did first time), but on a thematic level this is highly interesting. Hitchcocks juxtaposes the American dream with danger. He works extremely hard to fill the movie with many allusions, metaphors. Note how the survey of the typical American family is not a mere plot element, but also a way of rubbing the ordinary into our faces. Similarly, traditional or common-use things like a waltz theme or the mother baking her perfect cake are used to enhance this image. And meanwhile, there is of course danger threatening to rip this apart. At one point, one of the characters even says it bluntly: \"You live in a dream. You're a sleepwalker, blind.\" And young Charlie's idolisation of her Uncle Charlie is for sure intentionally a little brooding, embodying the tension between the two things at work here. As much as this is an entertaining mystery, it is also Hitchcock's way of forcing us to view the danger amidst the ordinary.What Hitchcock does here is very reminiscent of what Lynch does in many of his works, particularly Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks. There are differences: Lynch goes further and deconstructs the American suburb dream, whereas Hitchcock's main concern is not showing the ugliness within the dream itself, rather showing how there is some ugliness threatening the dream. And perhaps Lynch is a little more perverse (of course he had no Hays censor code to work with).",

UC displaces Joe as the father figure (i.e. Hitler becomes the fuhrer), no one around these people sees them as dangerous until its too late, both Hitler and UC are merely \"in business the way men are\", their only job is murder/politics. Those are just a few examples, I'd really like to know if their are scholarly essays out there on this, or to know if I'm just crazy.It also seems that this is a \"what if\", kind of movie-- suggesting what it may have been like if a figure like Hitler had been eliminated early and minimized his deadly effects on the world.",

Joseph Cotton plays the beloved `Uncle Charlie', who pays a visit to his older sister and her family.  Meanwhile his adoring niece is tipped off by a detective that her uncle is a serial killer.  Some undeveloped references to telepathy and an unintended, yet apparent sexual chemistry between Uncle and Niece just added to the things I did not like about this film.  Shadow of a Doubt may be a masterpiece to film majors, but for an average moviegoer like myself, this film is no greater than any other - and definitely nothing special.",

I won't include any spoilers, although some of this won't make complete sense unless you've seen the movie. Joseph Cotten's character, \"Uncle Charlie,\" goes to spend time with his sister's family, apparently to get away from a couple of guys who are trying to hunt him down (why, is not immediately apparent). The drama begins when Charlie tries to get rid of a newspaper page containing a story about him. Problem is, only he knew it was about him. Nobody else would have connected it with him, and he must have known that. Two central characters then concoct an elaborate scheme, involving posing as reporters, to get a photograph of his face, when they could have just set up across the street with a telephoto lens (which I'm pretty sure they had circa 1940). For that matter, they could've simply walked up to him as soon as he came out the front door. There was no reason for the magazine scheme, except as a plot device, that leads to one of the main characters implausibly falling head over heels in love, with further complications ensuing. Eventually we learn that the plot involves some murders. At the end, everybody seems happy to leave things as they are, because the murderer is dead, but it would not have been that simple. There would have been issues to resolve about what was stolen from the victims. No honest police officer would just walk away and leave things as they stood, knowing about those outstanding issues. Well directed, with some nice camera work, and generally well acted. The kids are a little stiff, unsurprisingly, though Henry Travers is excellent in his supporting role as Joseph Newton. But the plot lets this movie down.",

            "content": "Joseph Cotten made one of the great screen villains ever with his Uncle Charlie, who gathers complexity not because of the possibility of his innocence (from the opening scenes it's clear Hitchcock is not playing that game) but because of the identification he elicits from both the viewer and from his niece. He's a tortured soul as well as a torturing one. Teresa Wright matches Cotten every step of the way, as a good girl who never falls into the stilted ingenue trap of the period. That confrontation at the back steps near the conclusion is a classic cinematic confrontation, and the menace is all hers (\"Go away or I'll kill you myself...that's how I feel...\")The supporting players are uniformly fine, especially Patricia Collinge as snookered sister Emma and Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn as the comic-relief pair (the latter two do a lot to liven up some duller patches in the second half.) I may be the only one who feels this way, but I love Janet Shaw as that poor waitress Louise, the kind of person Charlie might have become if her uncle had his way. (\"I've been in half the restaurants in town...Yes sir, for a ring like that I'd just about die.\")The most interesting thing about \"Shadow of a Doubt\" is the marriage of two great artistic visions, Hitchcock's belief in the core evil of humankind and Thornton Wilder's sunnier but no less complex focus on how society, informed with some sense of spiritual responsibility, can shape man for the better. There's a duality here that is presented to us in varying ways throughout the film, most successfully with the two lead characters, \"twins\" who live on opposite ends of a wide moral chasm.I just wish this film moved a bit faster and that the characters weren't so marble-mouthed at times. I don't think this is MTV-era carping, it just feels slow for a Hitchcock film. Then again, compared to \"Our Town,\" this is a Will Smith video, so maybe that Hitchcock-Wilder duality has its downside. I give it an 8, not tops but I really enjoy it and think you will, too.",

I just feel disappointed with the main character, Charlie. She is supposed to be the smartest girl from her school, but she makes countless stupid decisions. She is the definition of really book smart with absolutely no street smarts whatsoever. How many attempted murders does it take before you learn? He tries killing her by rigging the stairs to break and she realizes this, but she still runs right into the garage when the car is running even though she is perfectly aware that A) someone is trying to kill her and B) The door to the garage closes and locks on its own. But guess what! She decides to take a nice little stroll around the city at night with Charles following her around. But the worst of everything is stepping foot on that train. He's tried to kill you multiple times already. Use your brain! My other problem is the way she figured out that he was bad. Early in the movie, you could see how smart she was because she was putting some odd pieces together and realizing that something was not quite right. I wish the detectives had not come around so she could continue to piece this odd mystery together without their useless help. It would have made it a much better movie, in my honest opinion.After all these bad things, you must think I'm rating this a 1, but it is a good movie, but it could have been GREAT!",

It's a dark tale of deception loaded with incestuous overtones, using much hand symbolism as often seen in Hitchcock's movies.A very young Hume Cronyn plays a role rarely seen in older movies. He plays a closeted gay person who seems to be perfectly happy in his own skin and free of personal torment or malice. This character has quite a bromance going with Charlie's father. Throughout the movie the two of them repeatedly pair up and disappear together. This is a far cry from the closeted, tortured gay characters seen in \"Strangers on a Train\" and \"Rope\", and from the evil ways gay men are often portrayed in old movies in general.The romance between the detective and Charlie seems a bit rushed, the detective having known her for only a few days. Certainly too soon to propose marriage by any standards. Plus, although the actor playing the detective, McDonald Carey, is only five years older than Teresa Wright, he looks old enough to be her father.One particularly odd moment occurred when the detective asked Charlie's mother if he could take Charlie out for the evening so he could \"interview\" her. Her mother doesn't seem to mind this request, but instead suggests he take Ann, Charlie's younger sister, who looks to be maybe 9 years old. And the mother knows nothing about the man. Is that what mothers did in the 1940's, just hand their prepubescent daughters over to men who were practically strangers?Overall, an entertaining, if not prefect, Hitchcock movie.",

            "content": "I found Alfred Hitchcock's film \"Shadow of a Doubt\" a very intriguing movie. One of the things that stood out for me was the way Hitchcock put together the film with so much thought, and time. This was my very first Hitchcock film actually, and after seeing this I have picked up on other of Hitchcock's films. Uncle Charlie is viewed upon with mysterious music\u0085shadowing lights\u0085and a look of suspicion. Though he may have a light side to his part of being Uncle Charlie, there is also a dark side that is trying to flee from what is occupying his mind. So he goes to visit his older sister, and family in a small suburban town. He comes in with innocence, knowing he can try to hide his secret. He's zoomed in on with the camera with a look that makes you think. It makes me think of something is going on that he's not telling us. As he smokes cigars, the smoke rises up in front of his face; the smoke hides Uncle Charlie's face for a moment. Uncle Charlie defiantly has something going on. He has a relationship with his niece, Young Charlie that is so pure and sweet. Young Charlie is always excited to be around with her uncle, and she doesn't expect anything from him but kindness. As the film roles on, Young Charlie gets suspicious. With detectives coming to her home, wanting to talk with her Uncle Charlie specifically, Uncle Charlie tries to hide away. Young Charlie catches on to this and gets into some research about what's been in the news paper lately. She has caught on to her Uncle Charlie, wanting to help the detectives out. The way Hitchcock put this film together is amazing. Not once did I draw my eyes away from the scene. He left me at the edge of my seat wanting to know what was going on, and what would happen next. And the way Hitchcock set up the scenes to relate with the characters was wonderful. For example, one that stood out was the train's smoke. As Uncle Charlie is arriving to the station, there is a huge cloud of black smoke that rises up out of the train. It surrounds the station, making the sun disappear. Everything is dark, and as the smoke starts to evaporate into the sky the music gets happier, and Uncle Charlie steps out seeing his family waiting for him. The smoke is gone\u0085for now. Later in the movie, we see Uncle Charlie lying on his bed smoking a cigar. He puffs rings of smoke out of his mouth, and as that happens you hear faintly in the background the train's horn, and the scene of Uncle Charlie is gone. Now that I have seen \"Shadow of a Doubt\" thanks to my Film Studies teacher, I have fully enjoyed the Hitchcock films, and this one in particular was very well done. If what you're looking for is mystery, drama, and a classic I should say, this is your kind of film.",

            "review_title": "analysis of the theme",
            "content": "************************Careful SPOILERS ahead************************\nTheme is the underlying subject of the entire film one is watching.  The theme of Shadow of a Doubt is subtle at times but nonetheless important. The theme of the film seems to be the duality of the human condition. Stated another way, the theme is that human beings are capable of doing good and evil.  As Spoto says, Little Charlie (Teresa Wright) and Uncle Charlie (Uncle Charlie) are two sides of a coin.  Uncle Charlie is an `evil' murderer of helpless widows.  Little Charlie is a kind, loving niece who would never do such things. What Hitchcock does is to almost make Uncle Charlie and Little Charlie the same character.  It is as if they are two dueling sides of one persons mind. One tells the person to do good while the other tells the person to do evil.  This is similar to the relationship between Bruno and Guy in Strangers on a Train.  Bruno and Guy meet `accidentally' on a train and immediately it is evident that they are polar opposites.  However, they are both related in some way.  There is a strange homosexual attraction between Bruno and Guy.  This is similar to the incestuous relationship between Uncle Charlie and Little Charlie.  She says that they are more than uncle and niece.  She knows him.  I do not, however, believe that Hitchcock wants to make them lovers.  Instead, I think the strange relationship is supposed to strengthen the connection between the two and make it clear that they are the same person. This theme of duality is expressed in many of the scenes in Shadow of a Doubt.  One scene Spoto gets at when he talks about the presentation of the characters.  The scene takes place at the very beginning of the film.  We see the camera zoom in on the streets of Philadelphia, cutting in closer to an apartment building.  The camera finds itself zooming in on Uncle Charlie, lying on a bed.  This whole part is done to show the darkness of Uncle Charlie's surroundings, thus showing the darkness of his character.  This is juxtaposed with a shot of Little Charlie's house.  It is in the very beautiful Santa Rosa.  It zooms in and cuts to Little Charlie's room. Like her uncle, she is lying on the bed thinking.  This whole scene shows the beauty and peacefulness of Little Charlie's surroundings, thus showing her beautiful character.  Both characters lie in the same position and are presented very similarly.  What Hitchcock shows is the two sides of the coin.  He shows the good Little Charlie and the evil Uncle Charlie. Another scene, which reflects the theme, is one in which Little Charlie walks up the stairs to find her uncle waiting for her.  He stands in the dark while she is has more light on her.  The young Charlie has found out that her uncle is a serial killer.  She tells him to leave and he says he will in time.  This scene reflects the theme in that it shows the two sides of the psyche conflicting, one in light and one in shadow.  Charlie is the good side trying to get the bad side to leave. The theme of the film can also be seen in the techniques that Hitchcock uses.  One technique is his running motif of the `Merry Widow March.' This tune that jumps from Uncle Charlie's head to his niece's helps to strengthen the link between the two. It makes them more the same character.  This tune is in fact the MaGuffin of the film.  It is the clue that we never notice while watching the film.  One scene in which the motif is used is one that takes place at the dinner table.  Little Charlie comes to the table with a tune stuck in her head.  She says she cannot think of what it is.  Uncle Charlie attempts to call it the Blue Danube Waltz, but his niece soon figures it out.  Before she can say the name of it, he spills wine.  This is a sign that the uncle wants to separate himself from his niece, or perhaps his other half.  This tune brings the two closer together, thus making them conflict more. Another technique that contributes to the theme is Hitchcock's use of angles.  For Uncle Charlie in many scenes, he uses low angle shots to make him seem more imposing and powerful.  In many scenes, high angle shots are used for Little Charlie.  This makes her seem much more confused by her surroundings.  She does not hold power like her uncle.  She looks like a pawn being played in a disturbing chess game.  One shot that exemplifies this shows Uncle Charlie in his room.  He looks out to see his niece talking with her friend/boyfriend Detective Jack Graham (MacDonald Carey).   A low angle shot shows him dropping his cigar and position his hands as if to strangle someone.  This shows the evil power of the uncle.  A high angle P.O.V. shot is used to see Little Charlie conversing with her friend. These angles in the scene make Uncle Charlie look like the evil power, while his niece is good and almost without power. All of these scenes and techniques point to the theme of conflicting psyches.  The scenes show that Little Charlie is the good side conflicting with her uncle, the evil side.  They are meant to be parts of the same person.  The incestuous relationship makes them look closer than just uncle and niece.  They are psychologically linked and will fight for what they believe is right.",

I also think Joseph Cotten (a favorite of mine from Gaslight, Portrait of Jennie, and I think Laura) is excellent. I'm used to seeing him as more of a hero, but here he plays a kind of villain (which isn't giving anything away as you know that from the beginning of the film.) The family is hilarious -- especially the bookish younger sister Anna. I love the way humor, drama, and a sense of horror are blended in this film. It's interesting to note that this was Hitchcock's personal favorite.

As the movie continues we see that Charles lives life in the past and one in the present being disgusted by the current and fond of the old where as young Charlie is happy with the current but not with the reality of the world. It's brutality and barbarism disgusts her and she is very outspoken about it as Charles is. She is all pleasant and beautiful and Charles is dark, brooding.

The identity of the \"bad guy\" in this movie is revealed right from the beginning of the movie so the \"suspense\" is about how this will eventually play out. An effective overtone in relation to \"menace within a family\" plays throughout. There are some early hallmarks here of the polished style to come. The overhead shots, the use of shadow and angled camera etc which mark it out as Hitchcock beginning to develop his art and make the movie well worth watching. However for me the three devices used to seek to bring the suspense to a close (a sawn through step, a smoke filled garage and finally a struggle on a train) do not play out as effectively as some of Hitchcock's more inventive conclusions or sub-plots from other highly rated films. As in a number of early Hitchcock movies the ending (when it comes) feels to me in 2019 to be \"rushed\".

            "content": "Shadow of a Doubt was, according to the Director himself, Hitchcock's favorite of his films, most likely because it opened a door for his later work. He had moved past the point of merely trying to thrill an audience, instead towards shocking them. Coming from an outsider's perspective, Hitchcock saw America for what it was at the time: a culture obsessed with war and violence that wanted to bury the past. America had been involved in World War II for several years at this point, those left behind were mainly older people who had little to do outside of work. He knew people wanted to see a good murder-mystery, and he finally poked at people's interest in the subject, by putting them in the story.Beginning in the average home life of the time, Hitchcock unsettles everything by introducing Uncle Charlie. The viewer is immediately introduced to Charlie's world, where we understand right away that he is a murderer evading the police. But to his family, Uncle Charlie is a charming, charismatic, handsome man, who is also obviously disturbed in some way. The way the characters choose to ignore this fact is telling. Uncle Uncle Charlie obviously has some sort of past abuse of some form or another in order to be a violent criminal, and his character lets his resentment known a number of times. The fact that no one had even attempted at this point to examine what made someone this way is revolutionary, and is not merely a coincidence. Uncle Charlie seems intent on burying the past the same way everyday people at time also attempted. Regardless, he is desperate to bring the family together, even though it can't be ignored that he is a criminal trying to hide himself in a normal setting. The fact that Hitchcock had chosen to bring a killer into a family setting is the source of the film's suspense. He was trying to get under the skin of everyday people at the time. All he had to do to in order to achieve this, was put Uncle Charlie at a dinner table with everyday people. The dinner scene carries the entire significance of the film. All focus is put on Uncle Charlie during the scene. We see, in close up, Uncle Charlie summarize his harsh feelings towards his targets, in a way that the audience is unable to ignore. It defines the entire work, and it is masterfully executed. Make sure to watch intently as it happens.The entire film hints at something unseen. Alfred Hitchcock knew that suspense came from a more mysterious place, and this is him executing that at a masterful level.",

As authentic as she remained to the change in her feelings toward her uncle, she still did not take her authentic intuition to its rightful conclusion, and this may have cost her her life, yet again.\nOne could think of a parallel in real life, as so often happens in the case of childhood abuse. Where the uncle abuses the sweet, innocent and trusting niece, and instead of reporting the incident, the child would keep the news of her abuse to herself for fear of ruining the image of the \"happy, normal family.\" The motif of the \"normal happy family\" was played out most strongly by the mother (sister of Charlie senior)..another case where the mother remains clueless as to what is really going down in her very own household, and blinded by her admiration for her mysterious brother (she does not even know what his real occupation is)- she overrides her own instincts. Or something like that. This interpretation is my own and one does not need any interpretation to simply enjoy this early Hitchcock thriller, filled with tension, dark foreboding and excellent performances by both Charlies.",

It's a wonderfully dark tale about murder, how evil lives next door and the naivety and complacency of the human race.\n\nCotten is ably supported by the fabulous Teresa Wright. The duality and curious nature of their characters' relationship never fails to entrance me every time I watch this film. \n\nI cannot recommend this enough. As one film critic says \"if you don't know Shadow of a Doubt you don't know him (Hitchcock) actually\". I would say alongside Rear Window and North By Northwest it is one of his most Hitchcockian films.\n\nIn all of Hitchcock's works I would only rate Vertigo and Rear Window above Shadow of a Doubt and it's one that deserves to be higher on the list of his best ever films.",

But as the story develops, we understand better the characters as well as Hitchcock's objective. This movie is about 78 years old, but it is amazing how the tension moments still hold up thanks to Cotten's and Wright's performances, and also to the fantastic camerawork. We can realize that the girl is actually in love with her uncle. And all of a sudden, her dream-like life in a peaceful town becomes a nightmare. Young Charlie's love for her uncle turns into hate. And to keep a \"clean image\" of a murderer, she must also keep the appearences by dealing with a deep love feeling and a moral conflict. This is a very contemporary critic about society, so relevant today as it was then. Arguably one of Hitch's best features despite Macdonald Carey's performance which I find kind of flat.",

            "content": "An early shining example of Alfred Hitchcock's directorial genius!\n\nAlfred Hitchcock's suspense thriller Shadow of a Doubt (1943) is a visceral and frightening depiction of a mass murderer on the run. Hitchcock draws out your fear for this small California town family's safety as they attempt to survive Uncle Charlie, who they do not even know is a serial killer. Hitchcock uses his signature long panning shots of stairs, doors, streets, as well as close-ups on faces for maximum effectiveness. Hitchcock simply understands what we are afraid of and exploits it in Shadow of a Doubt for tense encounters between a killer uncle and his astute niece.\n\nThe black and white cinematography is lush with beauty. From waltzers spinning in circles to a dutch angle shot of the unnerved killer fearing his capture and many more clever shots. I adore Joseph A. Valentine's cinematography in the library as young Charlie reads the newspaper clipping that reveals the plot. As young Charlie discovers who her uncle is the camera smoothly zooms out to a high aerial shot indoors with dark moody lighting for a haunting reveal. Shadow of a Doubt is full of neat and expressive shots.\n\nDimitri Tiomkin's score is scary as it swells for the dramatic sequences and carries you away with lovely passages for the sweeter moments. Tiomkin finds serenity in the quiet family moments and builds a crescendo of fear during the climactic sequences. I love Shadow of a Doubt's music.\n\nI adore Teresa Wright as young Charlotte \"Charlie\" Newton. She is so astute, nearing on clairvoyant, which gives her character a maturity and wisdom beyond her years. She is a subtle hero of her tough circumstances. Wright plays Charlie with a fierce determination and willful certainty. Teresa Wright acts pound for pound alongside Joseph Cotton at the heights of his acting prowess in a magnificent display as an actress.\n\nJoseph Cotton demonstrates his range in Shadow of a Doubt as the widow murderer Charles \"Uncle Charlie\" Oakley. Cotton sheds his nice guy persona from all his other classic films like Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, or The Third Man. Cotton's warm demeanor and delightful voice are nowhere to be found in Shadow of a Doubt as he opts to play Charlie as a cold deadpan killer with a silent menace and an obvious distaste for humanity. Cotton's hyper focused and highly nuanced villain is one for the ages. His constant pleasant attitude towards his family is so under-handed as he reveals his inner rage to his unsuspecting niece. It's honestly shocking every time I witness Joseph Cotton's transformation from the calm voice of reason to the monotone monster at the center of Shadow of a Doubt. Joseph Cotton is surely one of cinema's greatest antagonists in Shadow of a Doubt.\n\nHenry Travers is splendid as Joseph Newton, the kindly father to young Charlie, with his funny obsession with murder mysteries alongside his quaint friend Hume Cronyn as Herbie. They give a lot of much appreciated comedy relief from the super tense sequences within Shadow of a Doubt.\n\nLikewise, Patricia Collinge is devastating as Charlie's tired and lonely mother Emma Newton. Her desperation for her younger brother Uncle Charlie to stay with her is really saddening and upsetting. On the other hand, Edna May Wonacott is hilarious and endearing as Ann Newton. Her bright remarks are always a fun reprieve to the suspense in Shadow of a Doubt. Similarly, Charles Bates is a charming young son Roger Newton.\n\nOverall, Shadow of a Doubt elevates Hitchcock's masterful direction with all time great performances. I cannot recommend Shadow of a Doubt enough!",

He lives in Philadelphia and is a bit of a legend in the family, being a wealthy, self-made man.  His niece, also named Charlie, is particularly fond of him.  However, when he arrives, Uncle Charlie starts to act suspiciously.  Soon two surveyors appear at the house and start to ask questions about Uncle Charlie.  (Niece) Charlie starts to investigate and discovers that the two men are detectives and Uncle Charlie is a suspect in a nationwide manhunt and murder investigation.  However, the closer she gets to the truth, the more her own life is potentially in danger.\n\nA reasonably intriguing Alfred Hitchcock crime drama.  In typical Hitchcock fashion it unfolds slowly and deliberately, incrementally revealing just enough to keep you watching, while building up to a tense climax.\n\nNot among Hitchcock's best though.  The build-up is perhaps too slow here.  In addition, despite the title, there is not really that much doubt about whether Uncle Charlie is involved in the crimes, so the possibilities with regard to the outcome are limited.  The conclusion thus feels a touch inevitable, though there are a few other ways it could have gone (however, none of these would have been as exciting or complete).",

Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten) is on the run from the law on the East Coast, and he settles in with his sister and her family in Santa Rosa.  Trouble is just behind him though, and it gets worse when his niece (also 'Charlie', named after him, and played by Teresa Wright) begins to suspect him of being the \"Merry Widow Murderer\".  \n\nI considered a slightly higher rating, but thought the pace in the first half of the movie was a little slow.  Some of the tension is also missing because we're pretty darn sure Uncle Charlie is guilty.  On the other hand, there is a real small town feeling to this setting, helped in no doubt by Thornton Wilder being one of the screenwriters, and the characters of Charlie's father (Henry Travers) and his friend (Hume Cronyn) passing the time by talking about the perfect murder are absolutely priceless.  The second half, including the increasing revelation of Uncle Charlie's dark views of humanity and the lengths to which he will go to protect himself, is what make the film so sinister.   As the movie came out during WWII, it seems to have a direct parallel to the evil leaders loose in the world, particularly in the film's final scene.",

Featuring a very strong female lead in Teresa Wright, Shadow of a Doubt is oddly feminist even if some dialogue is incredibly sexist (though these characters do not leave unscathed).

Finally.\n\nI tend to be wary when I watch old movies, maybe just because I always expect something like Citizen Kane: apparently extremely well-regarded, but ultimately a little boring. I figured it'd be different with this movie, since it's Hitchcock, who always makes thrilling movies, but I still had my concerns. But I was totally held the whole way through.\n\nThis movie isn't a thriller in the same way that a lot of modern-day thrillers are. There wasn't any explicit violence until the last few scenes, and even then, it was pretty tame. Still, though, it's suspenseful, because you don't know exactly what Uncle Charlie's secret is, and even though you can kind of assume it's murder, it's tense knowing that he has a secret and younger Charlie doesn't know.\n\nIt's a really interesting dynamic between the two. The movie starts with young Charlie's devotion to him almost a little too much - there's some uncomfortable sexual tension between them - but that makes it even sadder when Charlie slowly begins to realize the rumors about her uncle are correct, and her expressions of idolatry slowly turn to confusion, anxiety, and a subtle somberness. Teresa Wright is such a bubbly, sunny presence as Charlie, and Joseph Cotten is good at the kind of charming and charismatic yet secretive and deeply contemptuous character. That scene where he described how rich women deserved to die was pretty tense, and as the movie went on, I couldn't believe how evil he became, especially considering I thought the movie was going to feature him more as an antihero. But when Uncle Charlie started actually making attempts on Charlie's life, I was shocked.\n\nThere were a couple silly things, mostly having to do with Jack Graham, the detective. The timing is kind of awkward in one scene, with Charlie suddenly yelling, \"You're a detective, aren't you?\" or whatever before the transition had even finished, with little to no buildup. Also, when Graham said he loved her, it was a little unbelievable considering they only had one date, basically. Everyone at my screening laughed a little when he said that. To the movie's credit, though, Charlie actually rejected him, which I wasn't expecting as much. There's no real 'happily ever after' for Charlie and Jack, though we don't know what happens after the events of the movie.\n\nBesides, there were a lot of really nice touches that made up for any small grievances I had. There were a lot of really funny moments in the movie, usually due to the younger two siblings. That girl (Anne I think?) is hilarious, isn't she? Almost every line she said made me laugh. She was so cute and funny. I also was surprised to be entertained by all the conversations between the father and Herb. That little subplot was nice comic relief, and I enjoyed how it dovetailed with the main plot when Charlie overheard them and exploded at the family.\n\nOverall, this was a great first Hitchcock experience, and I'm really looking forward to watching more of his stuff.",

They added ironic comedy to the tense nature of the tale.\n\nI am not usually a fan of these \"small-town dramas\" but A.H. captures the atmospheric and dramatic aspects flawlessly, and the result is a perfect movie.",

With the assistance of Thornton Wilder (Our Town), Hitch contrasts a highly insulated (insular?) American small town with a darker uglier world outside.  He does this by showing the effects of the arrival of evil Uncle Charlie (the Merry Widow murderer - Joseph Cotten) on his heretofore innocent niece, Young Charlie (Teresa Wright).  As the Master of Suspense (but not surprise), Hitch is able to prolong the audience's anxiety about Uncle Charlie and his doings, as the detectives descend on Santa Rosa (the town) and Young Charlie cottons on.  He also takes the opportunity to work in his classic themes - the banality of evil (and \"wrong-doing\") and the complicity of guilt -- and to display his transgressive sense of humor (for example, Young Charlie's father Henry Travers and neighbor Hume Cronyn read true crime magazines and plot each other's murders). The movie is full of rhymes, starting with the two Charlies and extending to matching or doubled scenes, two suspects, two detectives, and so on. One of Hitchcock's most subversively wicked and fully realized films.",

            "content": "In 1941, Alfred Hitchcock just had \"Suspicion\", but now there isn't... or is a \"Shadow of a Doubt\". Yeah, without the \"Beyond\", it's kind of hard to guess the full level of urgency to this mystery thriller, regarding the possibility of an evil deed being done. Hey, Hitchcock is the Master of Suspense, so either his titles are even supposed to drive you mad with wonderment... or I'm just making up nonsense as I go along because there really is so much ambiguity to this film that it's hard to figure out what to talk about. I mean, it's Hitchcock, and by 1943, alone, he had a pretty firm formula down as a thriller storyteller, and yet, this was one of the first ones that people really remembered. Well, that's probably because, for 1943, it actually was kind of thrilling, at least more so than \"Suspicion\", which was alright and all, but not particularly eventful.  Granted, there's only so much momentum to this thriller, seeing as how there's apparently still a shadow of doubt keeping things from really hitting the fan. Still, the point is that this film is not simply a little more exciting than \"Suspicion\", but actually pretty darn decent, despite the flaws.\n\nWith all my ramblings about rambling thrillers like Alfred Hitchcock's \"Suspicion\", a film held back largely by natural shortcomings, this film itself has its conceptual limitations, of which there aren't enough to prevent compellingness from consistently standing firm, yet nevertheless enough to limit potential that is further shaken by familiarity. On top of being kind of thin, the path followed by this film is too familiar for its own good, or at least seems to, because among its tropes are Hollywood histrionics that are rarely all that carried away, and are ultimately pretty limited in quantity, but still recurring enough, as well as severe enough, to deliver on some questionably dated dialogue and melodramatics. Quite frankly, the big issue behind the histrionics is their betrayal of subtlety, for although this suspense thriller has enough sober intensity to thoroughly intrigue time and again, those lapses in subtlety all but aggravate in their shaking the thriller's genuineness, in addition to the dramatic momentum. Of course, the drama's momentum is not the only loose element to storytelling here, as structural momentum is itself questionable, as the generally solid, though arguably overblown scripting team of Thornton Wilder, Sally Benson and Alma Reville have their moments in which they leave certain segments to feel tight, and leave others to feel draggy, resulting in an inconsistency in pacing that is all but outdone by an inconsistency in tone. Not unlike something like \"Suspicion\", this film gets too lighthearted with its dramatic build-ups, so much so that when tensions begin to rise, they go rather undercut by tonal unevenness, which isn't to say that the dramatic heights are all that soaring, not so much because of storytelling hiccups, but by the natural shortcomings. Hitchcock's direction, at the very least, is actually inspired enough to transcend natural shortcomings and make a mighty compelling and ultimately rewarding dramatic thriller, but it all comes back to the natural shortcomings, which limit dramatic depth, further limited by all of the inconsistencies in tone, pacing and subtlety. Speaking of subtlety, the film runs a risk of subtly, but surely, collapsing into underwhelmingness, yet when it's all said and done, the thriller doesn't simply compel adequately, but proves to be worthy as Hitchcock's first true triumph as a thriller filmmaker, with impact, and even good looks.\n\nLimited by technical limitations of the time, Joseph Valentine's cinematography actually used the shortcomings of the time pretty effectively, carrying a certain fitting black-and-white palette whose bleakness goes reinforced by dapper plays on shadows that draw you into the near-claustrophobically intense environment that this thriller thrives on. Even more essential in the driving of this type of tight thriller is, of course, the characters, who are brought to life about as effectively as the visual style is, in this case by then-solid and still-impressive performances whose subtle dramatic layering is sometimes ahead of the time, and consistently effective. Joseph Cotten proves to be particularly impressive in his slickly charismatic and atmospherically intense portrayal of a seemingly caring man with deep, dark secrets that he can filter out only so much, so much so that Cotten, especially when working with an emotionally roughed Teresa Wright, drives much of this thriller whose bite relies on the minimal, perhaps too much so. Again, in addition to being formulaic, the story concept is kind of thin in scope, having an intentional tightness that threatens compellingness, but also establishes a potential for it through human intensity that screenwriters Sally Benson, Alma Reville and Thornton Wilder sell through well-rounded characterization, and an attention to light bite that was refreshing at the time, and has aged well. Well, maybe the compellingness hasn't aged especially gracefully, but make no mistake, it is ultimately secured, because if there is meat to this idea, its juiced and drawn upon about as much as it can be by highlights in the acting, script and, above all, direction. What can make or break this potentially underwhelming minimalist thriller is, of course, Alfred Hitchcock, who, through this film, surely had to be revelatory as a thriller filmmaker, because where the film's steadiness could have devolved into dullness, Hitchcock's thoughtful storytelling is realized enough in its celebration of bleak style and audacious material to immerse you into the narrative, whose gradual build in intensity is sold every step of the way enough for the film to grow more and more compelling as the plot thickens. I don't suppose the plot ever thickens all that substantially, yet meat never thins all that substantially either, and between thickness and thinness, Hitchcock cuts far enough to the bone to keep you attached, until the shortcomings are, if you will, over\"shadowed\" by thorough intrigue.\n\nOnce the shadows lift, reward value finds itself all but obscured by conventions, subtlety lapses, and pacing and tonal inconsistencies to the telling of an almost thin narrative, yet pronounced enough through fine cinematography, solid performances, - especially by Joseph Cotten - well-characterized writing, and biting direction to make Alfred Hitchcock's \"Shadow of a Doubt\" rewarding as one of the Master of Suspense's first triumphs in suspenseful cinema.\n\n3/5 - Good",

            "content": "This is a great, relatively early film in the Alfred Hitchcock canon. Parts of it have the cheery, all-American small-town feel of a Frank Capra film, but it also goes to darker places than his earlier The 39 Steps ever does, and anticipates films like Rope and Vertigo, as well as David Lynch's Blue Velvet and the recent Stoker. There's a lot of creepy stuff just under the surface of the movie, and it's got brilliant performances.\n\nThe movie opens with a man we come to know as Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten) fleeing from detectives in Philadelphia for unspecified reasons. Then we meet his post-high-school-age niece, also known as Charlie (Teresa Wright), who is excited to learn that her beloved Uncle Charlie is coming to visit her and the rest of the family. However, despite Uncle Charlie's superficial charm, the reason why the police are after him eventually gets in the way of the family's seemingly happy visit.\n\nTeresa Wright to a great degree carries this film, and she really is excellent here. Young Charlie's progress from gullible naivete to a troubled awareness of the darkness of the world is handled quite well, and Wright has the earnest charm and expressive face to do justice to the role. Joseph Cotten is terrifically creepy as Uncle Charlie - even before you find out exactly what he may have done, there's something off-putting about this guy. Henry Travers, who played Clarence in It's a Wonderful Life, is wonderful comic relief as young Charlie's father, a milquetoast obsessed with murder mysteries.\n\nHitchcock himself is of course the primary attraction for any of his films, and in this one we see him in full, seemingly easy command of the medium. Everything from the most dramatic camera movements to the most meticulous details of the scenery and lighting is meticulously planned, and it always contributes to the story. If it doesn't quite match his very best films, this is still a very important entry in his body of work, and probably better than just about any of the films he had made before it.",

This allows Hitch to pull off his famous 'twists' throughout the course of the movie, hitting you every now and then with something you simply weren't expecting.\n\nOne of my favourite elements in the movie is the ongoing dialogue between Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn, avid mystery readers who are constantly discussing the best ways to murder each other. Apart from being a bit of comic relief in an otherwise very dark film, it also demonstrates how lightly people think of murder and murderers...until they encounter them face-to-face.\n\nMy advice then, if you want to see this movie, is not to learn anything about it beforehand. Going in with no knowledge will increase the movie's initial impact, and will help you to appreciate why Hitchcock was the 'Master of Suspense'. This is a taut thriller with no gratuitous violence, foul language, or mature situations.\n\n(Hitch considered it 'a family film'.)\n\nEnjoy!",

            "content": "Out of all the films Alfred Hitchcock made, such as Psycho, Vertigo, and North by Northwest, Hitchcock revealed that his favorite film to make was Shadow of a Doubt, an early Hollywood film that helped define Hitchcock's career, though it's hardly noticed by viewers who have been into Vertigo.\r\n\r\nIn Shadow of a Doubt, we meet a mysterious man named Charlie (Joseph Cotton), who is a notorious criminal known as the \"Merry Widow Murderer\", who heads to the family of her niece Charlie (Teresa Wright), in order to hide. The niece Charlie loves her uncle, claiming that it's a miracle for him to show up. When a pair of detectives, led by Macdonald Carey, disguised as photographers show up for some information about the family, Young Charlie gets suspicious, and when she finds out the truth, Uncle Charlie starts a plot to kill off his \"favorite\" niece.\r\n\r\nHenry Travers plays Joseph Newton, Charlie's father, a banker, Patricia Collinge plays Charlie's mother, and although I missed this, Alfred Hitchcock supposedly cameos as a man who plays bridge on a train. Boy, does Hitchcock love his trains.\r\n\r\nWith Hitchcock claiming this to be his favorite film, I knew I had to see it. And boy, was I wowed. One again, Hitchcock delivers on the suspense, with some moments coming out as disturbing, such as Uncle Charlie's plots and the really crazy climax on, you guessed it, a train.\r\n\r\nAs for the acting, it's incredible. Joseph Cotton is menacing as the uncle, and some moments are downright creepy, such as a scene where he describes widows as swine. I enjoyed the family portrayed in the film, and it provides some good humor for the 1940's, and still does in 2013. But who is the real star of the film? For me, that would be Teresa Wright as Young Charlie, and SHE'S NOT EVEN A BLONDE!!!!!!     It's incredible that a non-blonde actress, that Hitchcock usually picks in his films, would deliver a strong performance as this. In her scenes with Cotton, the chemistry delivers, even if they weren't a romantic couple, a couple that Hitchcock succeeds a lot.\r\n\r\nHitchcock's favorite film is a winner, even if I prefer Vertigo. To put it straight, Shadow of a Doubt is a Hitchcock delight with a suspenseful plot and some phenomenal casting. Highly recommended for every fan of Hitchcock who hasn't seen it already.",

            "content": "By now, this is the fourth Hitchcock film that I've seen and it certainly is a better representation of what I understood his work to be than SABOTEUR was. SHADOW OF A DOUBT, which Hitchcock said was his favorite, is a rather simple tale that explores one of his favorite themes: mistaken identity. Joseph Cotten (THE THIRD MAN) plays \"Uncle Charlie\" who visits his family for a visit in Santa Rosa, California. However, he's not quite what his young niece Charlie remembers. One thing I've noticed about Hitchcock's films is the various ways he's able to create tension and suspense in a way that keeps the viewer hooked. Some of the elements he uses includes light and shadow, camera angles, the score, etc. All of them came together in a rather cohesive way that kept me interested in seeing where the story would go. This film also captures an America in transition. The world created here isn't the paranoia-filled one of SABOTEUR, but still one where suspicion is very palpable and there's a sense that trust is becoming less of an innate quality in Everytown, USA. Like in SABOTEUR, there are two characters who serve as thematic counterpoint to each other. Here, they are the two Charlies. Joseph Cotten's character is somewhat of an idealized figure for his young niece (Teresa Wright), but the reality of how cynical and pessimistic he really is gets revealed over the course of the film. I thought it was a brilliant way of showing how expectations measure up when faced with reality. There's also the \"is he/isn't he?\" sense of if he's really even the person he purports to be, which plays into the themes of suspicion and trust. One thing I wasn't entirely expecting was the awkward sexual tension (in a few scenes) between the two Charlies, which added an incest layer that helped to flesh out the tense relationship between them. If there's anything weak about the film, the ending was a bit abrupt and a romance that develops between young Charlie and a detective seemed to be shoehorned in (and provided for an unnecessary coda. Still, I liked this film very much and it bodes well for the successive Hitchcock films I'll be viewing later this month.",

            "content": "Yet another Hitchcock masterwork.  This time, the villain (or IS he?) is Charlie Oakley, played to perfection by Joseph Cotten. Charlie is on the East Coast, and slips by some detectives on his way to small town California to stay with his sister and her family. His niece (named after him) is at first delighted to see him, but begins to notice strange things he does and how he reacts oddly to others. When 2 reporters show up at the house to do an interview, it is revealed that they are actually detectives tracking Charlie, as he's one of the suspects for the 'Merry Widow' murders back East. Jack, the younger detective, asks Young Charlie to keep an eye on Uncle Charlie and see what if anything happens. She is torn between loyalty to the Uncle she worships, and the common sense that tells her something isn't right. Is Uncle Charlie really a cold-blooded killer? Or is it just a case of mistaken identity? Hitch has you hanging on until the very last moment to find out what happens.\nThis really is the master of suspense at work...the first chunk of the movie just sets things up, but the second part is where it really takes off. The camera work in Hitchcock films is marvelous making everyday things seem off, and combine it with a score from the great Dimitri Tiomkin (who worked on many Hitchcock scores) and you've got a great piece.  This also includes a famous/infamous speech made by Uncle Charlie about the nature of women that would surely set off a firestorm of controversy today, but in the film is perfectly suited to the character and advancing the plot at the same time. The genius of his films are that they take place in the everyday world, which makes them even more genuinely believable and therefore, potentially able to happen for real, even to people like you and me.  I mean, when a director can make a trip to the library seem like a matter of life and death, you know he's got you in the palm of his hand.\nThe only thing that kept this from 5-stars is the first half, which is a bit slow, and the performance of Teresa Wright as Young Charlie, who really grates on my nerves early on. Keep your eyes open for Henry Travers (Clarence in 'It's a Wonderful Life') and Hume Cronyn.\nRight up there with the Hitchcock classics, but not my absolute favourite. Definitely a must-see though.",

            "content": "In my opinion, Hitchcock's first masterpiece. Shadow of a Doubt is a classic movie that I have seen many times. The movie really succeeds at creating characters and tension.\r\n\r\nThe story starts out with a charming young woman. Charlie is a teenage girl who is named after her uncle Charlie. Uncle Charlie comes to visit Charlie and her family. Everything is idyllic except for one thing, Uncle Charlie is a mass murder, known as The Merry Widow Murderer. He kills old ladies, who he thinks have no reason to live, and takes their money. The family doesn't know about it, but young Charlie slowly comes to find out the truth about her uncle, who begins to act strangely. The question is, who will Uncle Charlie kill next.\r\n\r\nJoseph Cotten gives one of his best, if not his very best performance ever. And of course, psychopaths are always scarier when they seem somewhat normal and rational. Cotten isn't known for playing villains, but after seeing this movie, you'll wonder why. Teresa Wright plays young Charlie. Given the character, she really couldn't be much better. Also look for some nice supporting roles for Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn.\r\n\r\nThis really is a great movie. Of all of Hitchcock's films, this was his favorite. I can't really blame him.\r\n\r\n\"You live in a dream. You're a sleepwalker, blind. How do you know what the world is like? Do you know the world is a foul sty? Do you know, if you rip off the fronts of houses, you'd find swine? The world's a hell. What does it matter what happens in it?\" 10/10",

The narrative doesn't stop to build-up the suspense, and while the viewer knows for most of the time what's really going on, the true quality of the movie comes from the fact that the players don't know, and we're anxious all the time, being unable to help them in any way. That's true realism of this tale. And it's also disturbing. A story about a girl, who becomes convinced that her mysterious uncle is a deadly killer on-the-loose, but isn't able to convince other family members, as there are too little clues and evidence. Great juxtaposition of two marvelous actors, Joseph Cotten as an uncle-from-hell and Theresa Wright as the overly suspicious, yet astute girl with a bold attitude. A Genuine psychological thriller.",

For me, \"Shadow of a Doubt\" is just to disparate for me to embrace. While each of the elements seem interesting on their own, none of it congeals. The film has no back story, you are supposed to be caring for Charlie (or at least that's what the overwrought score seems to convey). How can we care for this main character (and Young Charlie) if we don't know anything about them. We know she is good and he is bad, but WHY? How can we possibly love a character when we know so little about their decision making process? To me, this is lazy filmmaking. The film tries to be thrilling, funny, dark, romantic and fails every step of the way due to the lack of characterization. All we end up with is a film that will only scare the naive morons of Middle America... (which is what the film is about, so maybe it works?... nahhh)",

So understandably, I didn't remember much of it, so when I watched it the other night, it was almost like watching a new movie for me...And I have to say, I loved it the first time I saw it, and I loved the second time I saw it. \r\n\r\nThe Story: A young woman, finds out that her favorite uncle is a ruthless killer. At first she doesn't want to believe it, but it becomes clear to her, that her beloved Uncle Charlie isn't the man she and her family thought he was. It's one of my personal favorite Hitchcock films, partly due to the fact that it was one of the first I'd seen, but also because I love the story. What's more terrifying than a killer in the one place you can truly feel safe? The cinematography is great, and the lighting really makes uncle Charlie look evil. It gets from point A to point B in no time, you won't find any time to be bored with it. An all around great film. \r\n\r\nThe Cast: Teresa Wright, Joseph Cotten...There's more people in the cast but these are the only two that you're really going care about. Joseph Cotten is Uncle Charlie, the charismatic killer. He's so undeniably good at this role that, you'll have no choice but to fear him. Teresa Wright is young Charlie, Uncle Charlies favorite niece. You'll feel such a great connection with her, that you'll actually fear for her life as she's becomes aware of the danger she's in once she solves the mystery of her favorite uncle. These two have great chemistry on screen, Hitchcock knew how to cast people back in the day. \r\n\r\nOne to Five Scale: 5 \r\n\r\nOne of the best Hitchcock films ever made. If you've never seen a movie of his, this one is a great place to start. Every so often at movie stores, you'll find these old movies as re-releases on DVD or even VHS, and if you ever stumble across this one, don't hesitate to pick it up. \r\n\r\nTyler",

Of course, a less significant work from a grandmaster is still plenty good. Even though a lot of the characters are clich\u00e9s or the town is so \"American,\" I noticed implications of young girls desiring older men, and even the relationship between the uncle and niece at times does not seem ethical, although nothing intimate actually happens between them. This is what's most essential in Hitchcock's films, the characters are well groomed, well dressed and appear to be \"perfect,\" yet they are very much like how people are in reality and hold dark secrets. This to me is the essence of a world created by Hitchcock, which only few are able to do, to invent something of your own. Not to go too much into the movie, I would say it was mostly satisfying; however the ending could have been executed better. Joseph Cotten definitely delivers a chilling speech at the dinner table! It is quite strange that Hitchcock considers \"Shadow of a Doubt\" his best work, rather than \"Vertigo,\" \"North by Northwest,\" \"The Wrong Man,\" or \"Rear Window,\" etc. If I am not mistaken Scorsese's favorite from his films was \"The Age of Innocence,\" Welles' was \"Chimes at Midnight,\" and Bergman's favorite was \"Winter Light\" among his work. All those favorites are not considered the very best of their respective director by the majority. I guess everyone has their own preferences.",

            "content": "This film according to interviews with director Alfred Hitchcock was his favorite to make. He enjoyed the thought of bringing danger and evil to a small town. I will say this is one of the better of the Hitchcock films, but it has aged in a way that some moments to me are creepy in different ways. Charlie Newton (Teresa Wright) is a young teenage lady that is living in her small little town. One day her favorite uncle that she hasn't seen in quite some time Charlie Oakley (Joseph Cotten) arrives in town. Charlie herself was named after Uncle Charlie and she's always felt a strong connection to him. Things seem to be great, but Uncle Charlie starts acting very suspicious. Cutting out certain articles in the newspaper about a murderer, acting strange around everyone else and overall just being kind of plain creepy. Soon enough Charlie's family is visited by Jack Graham (Macdonald Carey) and Fred Saunders (Wallace Ford) two undercover detectives that are actually looking into Uncle Charlie showing up as he is one of two suspects in a string of murders. Soon enough Charlie realizes that Uncle Charlie is not the man he said he is which leads Uncle Charlie to start plotting on how to silence young Charlie for good. Ok, so as opposed to Saboteur (1942) i found the pacing for this movie to be great. This is the second time I've seen this film and I remember not exactly being the greatest fan last time, but I enjoyed it more this time. Uncle Charlie is just creepy. Cotten does a great job in his portrayal here and I really found him to be the kind of suave gentlemen with a very dark secret. Wright as Charlie is kind of annoying. She's very naive in the beginning and she even has a subplot with Jack that was very strange to me since Charlie is a teenager and Jack is a full grown man. This romance subplot comes out of nowhere and gives me that 1940's feel of shitty writing. Yup once again I'm criticizing the great Hitchcock, but come on. The suspense here is great though and I overall enjoyed the twists and turns this one brings. I still don't appreciate the somewhat sudden endings to all these films though and would like a bit more meat on the backend, but like I said before that's the 1940's style here. Overall, a better film than Saboteur and overall a pretty solid film. We aren't quite at the legendary status of Hitchcock films yet, but we are getting there!",

            "content": "Have you ever had a family member that you dearly love who has been keeping a dark secret about themselves from you for your whole life? If so, then you'll be the first to relate to the main character of Alfred Hitchcock's 1943 mystery Shadow of a Doubt. Our main protagonist is Charlotte \"Charlie\" Newton (Teresa Wright), a bored teenager in a small California town who has just learned that her uncle (Joseph Cotten), with the same name, is coming to town to visit her and her family. During his visit, she notices that her uncle is acting very odd at times, mainly when he refuses to have his picture be taken by strangers. Things change further when she discovers the last thing that her uncle would want her to discover, that he may indeed be a murderer on the run. \n\nDirector Alfred Hitchcock considered Shadow of a Doubt his favorite film out of all the films he made. Coming from the same talented filmmaker who made Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), and Psycho (1960), that's a high honor indeed. Looking at it again, I can certainly understand why that might be. It's basically a story about a young woman who goes through the most backstabbing situation she could find herself in. That, of course, being that she has a family member whom she can no longer trust because of a crime they committed. What's worse is that she wanted to know what secret this person was keeping from her in the first place. It's devastating because she sees another side to this person that she never thought she'd see and also didn't want them to become. \n\nShadow of a Doubt tells a powerful story that reminds us that there are going to be family members that aren't always going to be as trustworthy as we think they will be. No matter how hard we try to keep in touch with everyone in our families, there's always going to be difficulty in keeping tabs on each other and trying to know everything about a certain family member. In the case of the relationship between Uncle Charlie and Charlotte's mother Emma (Patricia Collinge), we have a brother-sister relationship in which the brother is trying to keep a secret that would separate him from his sister further. \n\nIf there are times in this movie in which you have to close your eyes because the worst thing imaginable is about to happen to these characters, then that means this film is doing its job. The reason being is that through all this dread with Charlotte emotionally separating further from her uncle, there is underlying suspense that indicates that it only gets worse. The screenplay by Thornton Wilder, Sally Benson, and Alma Reville creates tension all throughout the film and makes these characters feel real. It's fascinating that Charlotte's father (Henry Travers) invites his neighbor (Hume Cronyn) over for dinner every night just to talk about committing the perfect crime. All I can say is it's no wonder Charlotte doesn't react kindly to these conversations at dinner on top of her dilemma with her uncle. \n\nI sincerely believe that films and shows along the lines of Breaking Bad owe their existence to this masterful thriller. Joseph Cotten is chillingly good as the fishy uncle and Teresa Wright is full of life as his most cherished niece. The plot is powerful and very well paced by Hitchcock and his screenwriters. To talk any more about Shadow of a Doubt would only spoil the suspense along with your enjoyment of seeing it firsthand. So by all means, check out this Hitchcock classic and see why it's Hitchcock's own personal favorite.",

This does not make Cotten's performance bad, on the contrary,  he's incredibly terrifying. But without a doubt the best in show is Teresa Wright, whose performance is absolutely brilliant. She goes from innocent to paranoid so naturally and believably, that you're waiting to see what she'll do next and if Joseph Cotten will thwart her. Still, with a better climax and an ending that doesn't feel so rushed, this would've easily been counted as one of Hitchock's best. As it is now, it's a good movie with a fantastic performance from Teresa Wright.",

However, you've got to hand it over to Joseph Cotten's chilling role as Charlie Oakley for making this a somewhat stylish thriller. At the same time, I wouldn't say the same thing for the other performances - definitely not for Teresa Wright's forever chiming Charlie Newton. By far  the biggest disappointment of all was, in my view, the final scene at Charlie's funeral - what a sudden and anti-climatic ending! Let's just hope that none of the other Merry Widow murderers end up in such a macabre and lifeless funeral ceremony as that. And one more thing - wasn't it obvious to Mrs Newton that the garage scene, where Charlie almost got suffocated to death, was no accident? Seems like the sky would have fallen on her and yet she and her family would remain just as oblivious. Those wonderful techniques Hitchcock used in this (such as the dialogue and that revelation scene in the library where Charlie finally realizes her ideal uncle's real worth) were what I ultimately enjoyed. Other than that, Shadow of a Doubt left didn't leave me a shadow of a doubt with regards to its drab plainness.",

But Charlie's delight soon gives way to suspicion, then fear, then terror as she gradually comes to realize that he is hiding a dark secret -- that he is a serial killer on the run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is said to be Hitchcock's personal favorite among all the movies he made, and he was well within his rights to be very, very proud of it. With a script that is absolutely perfect in every way, a setting that captures the essence of the idyllic small American town so perfectly that Ray Bradbury would be moved to tears, and a cast that all deliver great performances in parts it seems they were born to play, there simply is not a single sour note in this movie.\r\n\r\nIt starts with a script that deftly sets up all its characters and manages to draw them as fully realized, three-dimension people within minutes of their first appearances on screen... usually through subtle character actions or exchanges. The most impressive of these is the film's lead character, a typical whiny restless teenager who in a script from lesser writers and interpreted by a lesser director would have been extremely annoying and someone you might wish ill upon. However, the character is so deftly written here and her reactions so believable--a mixture of childishness and adult and perception of what it means to be an adult--that you are rooting for her almost from the moment she is introduced into the story. \r\n\r\nThe same is true of the opposite side of the coin, the film's other Charlie... a man on the run with a secret, who may or may not be a serial killer. Like Young Charlie, he is deftly established a few touches that are followed up with further development that lends texture and deep character to him. \r\n\r\nThese two characters, and the oft-referenced \"special bond\" that exists between them, are the solid center around which story and other characters rotate, each developed as they relate to the two Charlies and each eventually emerging as fully realized as they are. Even the \"special bond\" ends up taking on personality, evolving from childish imaginings born of coincidences to something more real and that gives sinister weight to either Charlie when the younger of the two promises she will kill the older one if he hurts her mother.\r\n\r\nHeck, this script is so perfect that the insta-romance the develops between Young Charlie and one of the detectives who come into town on Uncle Charlie's tail doesn't bother me one bit. Where this has nearly ruined a couple other Hitchcock films for me, here it \r\n\r\nOf course, as well-written as these characters are, they would have withered in the hands of the wrong actor. Here, the casting is so absolutely perfect that the actors have an exponential impact when it comes to breathing life into the characters. Casting Joseph Cotton as a serial killer, who up to this point in his career had played nothing but lovable good guys, was a stroke of genius, and petite Teresa Wright nails her teenaged character perfectly despite being 25 at the time this film was made. Even the bit-players--like the small town's librarian and traffic cop--fit their roles perfect and instantly make the audience feel they know the person in question.\r\n\r\nThe great script and the perfectly cast actors are further supported by a great location and even better sets. A problem I sometimes have with Hitchcock's American films is sometimes jarring and obvious difference between footage made on sets or the studio back lot versus footage made on location. The quality of the environments change so drastically that I am sometimes pushed out of being absorbed in the movie. Not so here. Location and sound stage merge seamlessly and undetectably to form a perfect whole.\r\n\r\nIf you only watch one Hitchcock film, this is the one to choose.",

It's still somewhat shocking when you see that monologue today because it's so raw and features an abundance of anger and emotion.

            "content": "One of the scariest nightmares I have is finding out that someone close to me, be it a family member or friend, is a serial killer. That's a scary thought, and Alfred Hitchcock captures the pure fright of such a situation in Shadow of a Doubt, one of Hitchcock's best films.\r\n\r\nIn this story, Charlie a young woman is ecstatic about her Uncle Charlie coming to visit her and her family, but as the story progresses, she slowly begins to realize that Uncle Charlie may not be who he says he is. This story isn't anything original, even for Hitchcock, but what makes this story special is the way the story unfolds. The film is told from Charlie's point of view, and we go through what she's going through. Before we find out about Uncle Charlie's past, we get to know him just like the other family members do, so that we understand how impossible it sounds to them that he could be a killer.\r\n\r\nThe build-up for this film is some of the greatest I have ever seen in film. The film makes scenes that seem normal and yet make you sit on the edge of your seat. Alfred Hitchcock has always been a fantastic director, and this is some of his best work. He creates suspense with nearly every single shot, even if the scene on screen is charming. This creates an atmosphere in which anything can happen and gives the movie an unpredictable aspect about it.\r\n\r\nThe performance for Uncle Charlie is also very good. Joseph Cotton gives one of the most realistic performances ever. He does good as the man we know is hiding something, and yet at the same time gives a fa\u00e7ade so flawlessly that nobody suspects who he really is.\r\n\r\nThis film is almost flawless from start to finish. The beginning picks up your undivided attention, and the ending comes to a satisfying emotional turmoil and takes your breath away. The pacing is done really well, the acting is great from everybody, and there some real romantic chemistry between the two leads.\r\n\r\nAlfred Hitchcock often cited this film as his favorite film of his own, and who could blame him? Even though I've only seen a few, out of those, this is my 2nd favorite film that he has made, behind only Rear Window. A masterpiece in its own right, Shadow of a Doubt isn't given enough recognition, especially considering how well-crafted it is. Bravo.\r\n\r\n9.9/10",

He claimed that Jimmy Stewart ruined \"Vertigo\" and he ended up hating the film and never speaking to the actor again, I on the other hand think it's his crowing achievement and a fantastic Stewart performance. For me, \"Shadow of a Doubt\" is just to disparate for me to embrace. While each of the elements seem interesting on their own, none of it congeals. The film has no back story, you are supposed to be caring for Charlie (or at least that's what the overwrought score seems to convey). How can we care for this main character (and Young Charlie) if we don't know anything about them. We know she is good and he is bad, but WHY? How can we possibly love a character when we know so little about their decision making process? To me, this is lazy filmmaking. The film tries to be thrilling, funny, dark, romantic and fails every step of the way due to the lack of characterization. All we end up with is a film that will only scare the naive morons of Middle America... (which is what the film is about, so maybe it works?... nahhh)",

If you take away the technical excellence you've got nothing left.  Then again that's true of a large portion of Hitchcock's work; with the exception of a few masterpieces (some that are masterpieces perhaps also only on their technical merit, but that burst at the seams with it), many of his pictures seems to stem from tackling the challenge of taking one suspenseful idea that is probably in no way new and turning into an entertaining low-budget feature-length movie.  The sort of thing Stephen King has done with writing (King once referred to himself as \"the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and fries\").  At any rate, this is exactly the sort of movie that backs up my assertion that Charlie Chaplin and Stanley Kubrick are the two smartest people ever to come out of Hollywood; while Shadow of a Doubt is a masterful effort by a consistently strong auteur, the bulk of Hitchcock's work could be obliterated by almost any single randomly selected Chaplin or Kubrick feature.",

Uncle Charlie brings with him lavish gifts and over time she gets to feel something is fishy especially when they are visited by two supposed surveyors who turn out to be detectives (she knows of it after Det. Jack Graham played by Macdonald Carey takes her on a date). Turns out her beloved uncle is the wanted serial killer known as the \"Merry Widow Murderer\". \r\nThe tension really builds towards the second half of the movie when Charlie and her uncle turn confrontational. Cotton is good playing the sweet faced killer - you really feel he continues to deceive us until the very end of the film. It holds well after all these years - it is a clean, well and smoothly layered and constructed piece of cinema. \"Shadow of a Doubt\" is definitely a unique movie within Hitchcock's extensive resume but not one of his utmost best!

The only other Hitchcock film I've seen to date is \"The Birds.\" Yes, I am missing out on many classic films, currently working on it. Anyways, Shadow of a Doubt is a masterfully made film. It is more suspenseful than most films I've seen in recent years. The subtle acting of the two leads also helps propel this film.\r\n\r\nThis film is, once you boil it down, about the relationships between two characters: Charlies and... well Charlie. They are both seemingly nice people, and it is established early that they are not interested in material things. Of course both have deal with this very differently. In the beginning of the film Hitchcock makes their relationship appear as if it may lead to a sexual one. Of course they are Uncle and Niece, and so seeing the two flirting and being close make the viewer very uncomfortable. It is rather brilliant.\r\n\r\nThere are so many motifs, subtleties and attention to detail that makes the film intriguing without even focusing on the plot. Hitchcock uses camera angles, recurring themes and photographic images to aid in the storytelling. Take the introductions of Charles and Charlie. Both these scenes are parallel to each other, showing both characters lying on their bed, shrouded in shadows. These small touches, and motifs really drew me in to the film, and made me yearn to watch more, and isn't that what a film is supposed to do?  \r\n\r\nThere are several images in the film that are hauntingly beautiful. As Charlie's brother stands at the train station, becoming enveloped by the shadows of the train, When Uncle Charlie is describing his hatred for rich widows and turns to the camera and says \"Are they?,\" And the devastating scene of young charlie realizing that her uncle is getting away with his crime and stares at him in the doorway. All of these images will most likely be etched in my memory for eternity. \r\n\r\nThis film has no gratuitous violence, in fact it has none. It is a quieter film than most thrillers today. I will need to watch it again in order to pick up on the numerous details of it. I suggest you do the same.",

While the ending leaves a gaping plot hole and some of the dialogue can come across as corny and obvious, the positives outweigh the negatives largely here. Both Joseph Cotten and Teresa Wright do what is expected of them skillfully (although the beginning of their relationship is quite, unintentionally, somewhat inappropriately \"touchy\", if you will). Still, what makes this film a classic is Hitchcock's feel for increasing suspense until his coda, where everything explodes and its entirely satisfying (the act, that is, not quite the aftermath). Definitely a must-see for any Hitchcock fan.",

He explained that the surprise felt when the mystery is revealed is nothing compared to keeping suspense throughout the film. I agree.\r\n\r\n\"Shadow of a Doubt\" is a film about a man named Charlie Oakley, a real charmer with plenty of swagger to go around. From the very opening of the film, we can see that he has done something wrong and that he is being watched. Charlie decides to hide away as a guest in his sister's house. His niece, Charlotte, was named after him, and she goes by the name \"Charlie\". As soon as Charlie comes to stay at the house, everyone is happy to see him, most of all Charlotte. But as she begins to learn more about him, and what he has done, she wants him out. The problem: Charlie knows that she is privy to his crimes, and will stop at nothing to keep her silent.\r\n\r\n\"Shadow of a Doubt\" is a taut suspense film with plenty of dark humor as well. Like much of Hitchcock's work, it will keep you on the edge of your seat till the very end.",

Well, this didn't happen, but I kept thinking that he really wasn't a serial killer. Even after the death traps for some reason I still remained skeptical, although it should've been obvious at that point. I think that's what made my viewing so compelling though - I thought just as Charlie Newton did, that he couldn't have been the killer. I think that perspective is useful in relating to Teresa Wright's character and it makes Charlie Oakley seem that much more mysterious and interesting.\n\nRegardless, it's a great movie.",

If he finds out what she suspects, could that put even the life of his beloved niece in jeopardy? \n\nI don't really know how to review Shadow of a Doubt. I found myself liking it, even though I can't give any particular reasons why. In fact, I found it to be meandering and a little unfocused, at times. Yet it still left me with a positive impression. It had a different feel from any of the other Hitchcock movies that I've seen. There's little mystery to it, and the thrills and suspense are of a different kind than those that were offered in North by Northwest or Notorious. I'd struggle to compare this to any of his other movies. Yet, the director felt that it was his favorite. I can't deny that I found the relationship between Charlie and her uncle to be interesting, in all its phases. And since so much of the plot hinges on that, then perhaps that explains some of Shadow of a Doubt's likeability.   \n\nI'd say that if you're a fan of Hitchcock, give this film about family menace in Santa Rosa a try.

The change in mood and tone between that and \u00e2\u0080\u009cShadow\u00e2\u0080\u009d is considerable, and it shows the versatility of the director, as he maintains his style through unique blends of culture and genre.\n\nCharlotte \u00e2\u0080\u009cCharlie\u00e2\u0080\u009d Newton (Teresa Wright) is a bright young girl who is intensely bored and dismayed with her uneventful life. She lives with her family in a small Northern California town where everyone knows each other. That is until she one day decides that she is going to send a telegram requesting her Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten), whom she is named after, come and visit. Charlie is her favorite relative, and as she arrives at the post office to send her message, she discovers that he is already en route to visit her and the family. This is where it first becomes clear that there is either something telepathic going on between the two characters, or perhaps Hitchcock and Wilder are playing around with coincidence and chance.\n\nThe most interesting thing about the characters that inhabit this small town is that each of them is slightly off-kilter from what one would expect. Charlotte\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chirpy mother Emma (Patricia Collinge) pitter-patters around the house, yapping on and on about topics that have long been forgotten by all others in the room. When her brother Charlie arrives, she is so delighted, as she dotes upon his every need and concern, naively shrugging off his bizarre and morose rants about women and the world itself. These moments come quite unexpectedly, and without much warning, as do most of Charlie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s darker impulses. He is, after all, her \u00e2\u0080\u009cspoiled\u00e2\u0080\u009d younger brother. Why should he have anything to hide?\n\nWith \u00e2\u0080\u009cShadow\u00e2\u0080\u009d, Hitchcock is able to masterfully blend the typical small-town America with the darkness that quietly prowls beneath it.  After Charlotte begins to suspect that Charlie is whom the papers are calling the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMerry Widow Murderer\u00e2\u0080\u009d, strange and sinister events start to unfold, as a couple of detectives posing as government survey men show up and throw her entire sense of security and perception of her uncle off balance. There are wonderfully placed scenes of comic relief amongst the danger and mystery, featuring Charlotte\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father Joseph (Henry Travers) and his friend Herbie (Hume Cronyn), who are both unsolved crime story enthusiasts. They frequently get together and discuss different ways in which they would murder each other. It provides the film with splendid irony and even suspense in one scene when they are at the dinner table discussing how to get away with murder right in front of murderous Uncle Charlie and his next target. \n\nI recently watched David Lynch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlue Velvet\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the first time, and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t decide where my thoughts lie with it until I have watched it a second time. I think that there is an undeniable link to be made between Hitchcock and Lynch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s depictions of small-town America being infested and challenged by dark forces. There is a scene in \u00e2\u0080\u009cShadow\u00e2\u0080\u009d where Charlie takes his niece to a small \u00e2\u0080\u009cunderground\u00e2\u0080\u009d club, a place she says she would never normally go. There is a waitress who speaks to them briefly, and it is in this scene that I was reminded of \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlue Velvet\u00e2\u0080\u009d. From there, many details that followed also reminded me of Lynch, and of the way that he envisioned his small town USA and all of its quirky, off-center characters. The difference lies in how far the two directors go with the split of dark and light, and how far into each they descend. Hitchcock wisely shows the two sides rather evenly, and often times in the same room together. Unlike Dennis Hopper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character in Lynch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s film, Uncle Charlie doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t live in the darkness, but rather the light; the darkness lives in him, and as his desperation grows, he looses control and is forced to act on his inner impulses.\n\nThis is one of Hitchcock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s films that I had never heard much about, and although it is now considered a classic, it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do much business, critically or financially, when it was first released in 1943. I think it was ahead of its time, as many of his projects were. It is an outstanding piece of work that deserves the highest praise possible. The performances by Cotten, Wright, Collinge, and Cronyn (his first film) are pitch perfect. The writing is so sharp and exciting that I would consider it to be one of my favorite scripts of all time.\n\n Charlotte\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother warns her in one scene, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you whisper, anyone could hear you a block away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That line is so well timed, and it is one of the many elements of the movie that elevate it to brilliance. It is a difficult task to blend the darkness and the light, and to still maintain such vivid suspense and biting humor.

I think it was mainly due to talentless acting and the need to provide vast minutes of wasted time to fill in the gaps to an exciting story that would not have had a sufficient runtime. There was something missing in this film: Suspense. This slow-boiler film noir is deemed Hitchcock's favorite film that he has made. I'm sure it looked great on paper, but the delivery was lost in the dull delivery of this film.\n\nIt truly is a shame, because some parts of this were really well done, the famed \"dinner scene\" got me listening intently and made way for a much awaited plot twist. But the characters (especially the women) are one dimensional and at times very annoying and even dim-witted. Surprising coming from the master of suspense.... I just did not feel any real tension.\n\nThis could be blamed on the advancement of technology and the laxness films have these days with the censors, but I do not come from a CGI-loving background, and am very supportive of slower paced films that are both gripping and enjoyable. I could refer to the films of Michael Haneke (particularly Funny Games), a slow-boiling film with not many characters, yet the delivery makes all the difference, whereas in Shadow of a Doubt, you wander around much unneeded sequences for about 90 minutes to finally cut to the chase, and then it just ends abruptly. These are the way films seemed to have been made back then, and especially since the release of Citizen Kane in 1941, there were were some directors trying to emulate Orson Welles' style. This film has some throwbacks to Citizen Kane, but not many, as Hitchcock had a very unique vision.\n\nThis film could have been better. Needed to up the excitement rather than focus on a passive mystery.",

If the film was made today, the approach to the \"Uncle Charlie\" character would have been left a little ambiguous, which I think Hitchcock could have pulled off, but it is an artistic license Hollywood is still not ready to allow at that period of time. Joseph Cotten's character, \"The Merry Widow Murderer\" shares the same motivations  as that of Chaplin's Monsieur Verdoux, but their bitter sentiments about the realities of life differs, but there is no doubt that the two were the product of a harsh, unforgiving world.",

While it isn't my favorite of the directors (that would be \"Strangers on a Train\"), it is certainly one of Hitchcock's classic works and deserving of such distinction.  Two things I really like about this film is the somewhat satirical and relatively light tone that is taken for much of the film for what is essentially a serial killer mystery.  One of my favorite hallmarks of Hitchcock is the bizarre tone he chose in several of his pictures for what is essentially very dark and dramatic material.  You see it in a picture like \"Rope\", where Jimmy Stewart is discussing the practicality of murder in the same way one would discuss the purchase of new curtains for a window.  And in the aforementioned \"Strangers on a Train\", where a psychotic spoiled young man casually discusses the murder of his own man and a stranger's wife, as if it is perfectly natural for such conversations to take place in public settings.  The scenes where \"Uncle Charlie\" is working to fit in comfortably with what is essentially an \"All-American family\" are often as comical as they are suspenseful.  I enjoyed the story in this film, especially Joseph Cotten's performance as the man under suspicion who is living among the family.  Teresa Wright is also very good;  she manages to shift between a steadfast young woman who stubbornly believes her uncle's innocence to a confused young woman who believes \"Charlie\" might have a terrible secret with relative ease.  And of course the direction is spot-on;  I wouldn't expect anything less from Hitchcock.  This film doesn't pack quite as much of a punch as some of my favorite Hitchcock flicks, but it is still makes for entertaining fare.",

            "content": "If there was any question that Alfred Hitchcock had his style down pat before the much-lauded color classics, SHADOW OF A DOUBT puts that to rest. The British-born director displays an uncanny understanding not only of the American psyche, but of the forces of evil that prey there. In a time when Hollywood was plagued with quickie melodramas with lackluster talent, the inimitable Master of Suspense cut through the bullshit and produced a film of real quality. \r\n\r\nIn a seedy New Jersey tenement building, perfectly a propos, we first meet one of Hitch's most memorable villains-- Uncle Charlie. The coldly handsome Joseph Cotten was born to play the part, a role which like all of Hitchock's nemiseses is highly complex and multi-layered. Nothing is black and white beyond the film itself. \r\n\r\nUncle Charlie rouses himself from his contemplations to the discovery that two suit-clad men have staked out the building. The wily Cotten eludes his pursuers and boards a cross-continental train bound for his elder sister Emma's residence, the sleepy small town of Santa Rosa, California.\r\n\r\nIn classic style, the opening shot of Uncle Charlie is mirrored by that of another supine character, who we discover is the \"other\" Charlie-- played by the far prettier Teresa Wright. Worried that her household is stuck \"in a rut,\" she implores her father and mother to invite her beloved Uncle Charlie to visit, just to \"shake things up a little bit.\" Her mother demures, arguing that her uncle has more important things to do than visit them.\r\n\r\nBut of course, before she need despair over her parents having denied her request, Uncle Charlie announces via telegram his impending arrival. \"Do you believe in telepathy?\" asks young Charlie to the world-weary telegram operator. A running theme, we will discover, is the uncle and niece kinsmanship, in which young Charlie attests that she and her uncle are twins. But are they, really?\r\n\r\nThe darkness of New Jersey and the subtle moral deficiency we sense in Cotten's character are again seen, in a brilliant shot, when the train's long shadow encompasses the happy family waiting at the station. The potent symbolism, though somewhat below the radar, is just one of many examples of the decrepitude we'll get the vibe of from Hitch's master direction. \r\n\r\nThe small family of which young Charlie is a prominent member is brilliantly casted, each actor/actress inhibiting their roles sublimely. With the exception of Patricia Collinge's slightly overacted performance as the family matriarch, you sense the cast's preparedness and competence for their respective parts. Also of note is Henry Travers as the father and the know-it-all younger sister, Ann. And not slighting the other family member, youngest brother Roger, but his wasn't much of a remarkable role. \r\n\r\nHumor in the film is provided by the banter between a family friend, Herbie Hawkins (the talented Hume Cronyn), and the father. In classic Hitchcock humor, the two hold morbid conversations inspired by the mystery fiction the two enjoy. In my favorite line from the film, Cronyn's character says earnestly: \"Well, if I was gonna kill you, I wouldn't do a dumb thing like hitting you on the head. First of all, I don't like the fingerprint angle. Of course, I could always wear gloves. Press your hands against the pipe after you were dead and make you look like a suicide. Except it don't seem hardly likely that you'd beat yourself to death with a club. I'd murder you so it didn't look like murder.\"\r\n\r\nTogether the family welcomes Uncle Charlie to their charming home, a two story affair that perfectly conjures up the innocent feel of the characters. Young Charlie especially is effusive in welcoming her uncle, who at this point gives off ever stronger vibes that he is up to no good, and at first refuses the present he gives her on the grounds that his presence is gift enough. Eventually persuaded to accept it, young Charlie discovers in her all-trusting way that the stunning emerald ring has already been monogrammed-- \"CN to LL\" or something of the like. Her uncle is quick to call it a jeweler's mistake, and his niece doesn't suspect a thing. \r\n\r\nIn another scene indicative of Charlie's unnoticed menace, the uncle rashly tears off a piece of the father's evening paper, a piece that we will later discover is tantamount to understanding the crimes Charlie has committed. In another spry defense, he merrily uses the rest of the paper to construct a newspaper house for the children. Young Ann, especially, is not buying it from the outset. \r\n\r\nAnd so the multi-faceted plot boils down to a simple question: will Uncle Charlie's menace threaten the family that adores him?\r\n\r\nNot only do the plot and cast draw you into the film, the sleepy Santa Rosa acts as a third character in the movie. Hitchcock chose SHADOW OF A DOUBT as his personal favorite because he so enjoyed the prospect of corrupting an innocent small town with a swarthy villain. \r\n\r\nAnd it's easy to see how he could enjoy it, and why nearly 70 years later it still holds up as one of Hitch's best efforts. A likeable cast, in tandem with the Master of Suspense's direction, is a sure-fired recipe for thrills and chills of the first order. Not a SHADOW OF A DOUBT about it.",

When he comes to visit none is more excited to see him than his admiring niece \"Charlie\" who's fawning and admiring begins to melt away as she begins to suspect her uncle of horrific crimes.\r\n\r\nHitchcock is less interested in catching the killer and more interested in exploring the reaction and actions of a loved one when they discover a dark secret.  And as the stakes get higher, the actions get even more dire.\r\n\r\nAcademy Award winner Teresa Wright (for Mrs Miniver) is luminous and Orson Welles mainstay Joseph Cotten is perfect.  \r\n\r\nThere's no doubt why \"Shadow\" was one of Hitchcock's favorites.",

All of the characters felt genuine and three-dimensional, and the images of dancing couples is one of Hitchcock's most surreal and clever grounding the film as part of a continuing battle of the sexes. The female characters are all more interesting than the men here aside from the uncle who sets everything in motion. Our heroines suspiciouns about her favorite uncle perhaps bieng a murderer, lead her on a journey into the dissillusionment of adulthood without either aspect of the plot overwhelming the other. I liked this better some of the later Hitchcock stuff (I'm really more of a fan of his color films), but if anyone can suggest to me more of his early b&w stuff of this caliber, I will definitly look into it.",

One of the best, little touches, the film offers is the father's relationship with his best friend. They discuss literature, and have a running conversation throughout the film where they try and come up with the best ways of killing each other.

I love how this movie has a real subversive edge about the illusion of safety that small towns provide.  While it is a mere thriller on the surface it?s really about the Teresa Wright character?s coming of age and newly found self awareness.

The suspense is maintained until the very end of the film and the film is has a fantastic atmosphere: I really loved the beginning where the viewer is trying to understand what is going on. It is a wonder how the two basically naive parents gave birth to those two extraordinarily inteligent daughters! The way Uncle Charlie talks about life and especially widows never make them suspicous not to mention the blatant attempts of Uncle Charlie to kill their daughter! The recurring Merry Widow theme with the dancers is a nice touch. Also the emphasis on Uncle Charlie's strong hands: genious! I strongly reccomend it!",

It accomplishes so much emotionally, once you are on the ride it is hard to get off.  Great movie for rainy day.",

Its a typical film noir film, with frustratingly over the top incidental music at times but I liked the character development and as a Hitchcock film, it's not bad, particularly with the plot twists but its not entirely gripping I suppose. It's not a bad film and so I'd recommend it, yes.",

It continues to be well understood and enjoyed in both the present and the future because of its smart characters and script. I'm not exaggerating, this film is home to, quite possibly, the smartest female lead character at the time of its release. This is just one of many parts that make 'Shadow of a Doubt' so brilliant because when all is said and done, this film was a game changer. Many Thrillers since have been inspired by its modern writing, pacing, and cinematography. It is such a pleasure to watch these film elements unfold because I had fun comparing some scenes from the film with the future films it inspired. Whenever Hitchcock was asked in interviews, 'What is your favourite film from your filmography?' His response was \"Shadow of a Doubt\". It was certainly a damn fine choice.",
