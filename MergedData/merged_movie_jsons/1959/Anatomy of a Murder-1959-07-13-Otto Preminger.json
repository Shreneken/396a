            "content": "'Anatomy of a Murder' illustrates vividly how one lawyer repeatedly faces the heat of a controversial rape-case courtroom battle... The film might be Stewart's finest performance... For his magnificent achievement, Stewart was nominated for an Academy Award... The film itself received a total of seven Oscars in various categories, but was overtaken by William Wyler's 'Ben-Hur', the blockbuster of that year, whose star, Charlton Heston, beat out Stewart for best actor...'Anatomy of a Murder' is one of the few great racy courtroom melodramas ever put on the screen... It is a study of characters superbly detailed, in which a simple country lawyer zealously defends a young Army lieutenant charged with clearly gunning down a bar-owner who, he alleges, raped his young wife... The murder takes place some time after Remick tells her husband (Gazzara) she was raped\u0096enough time to suggest that the killing was not done in the heat of passion but with some deliberation... Stewart, a warm bachelor lawyer with an old-fashioned grace of manner, is wonderfully believable as the qualified defense attorney, who tries to establish whether or not Lee Remick has been raped... He masterfully guides his defendant to the most exciting climax, repeatedly drawing forth evidence which he knows to be inadmissible, but which he wants the jury to hear... Stewart smokes cheap cigars, plays jazz piano, and restrains beautifully Remick's flirtatious overtures, but his benevolence is never in question... We see him hauling the provocative Remick from out of the bar telling her to be a good, and submissive housewife for the court...Stewart studies with a cynical eye the peculiar traits of the accused, tolerates, with amused resignation, his friend's drunken lapses, and competently makes his point to the judge and jury...Ben Gazzara proves to be a problematic client, close to uncooperative with his lawyer... Also, it is very clear that he is a jealously possessive man, which is enough to question the validity of the rape charge, he claims that he acted in a moment of insane anger... The film raises fascinating legal highlights on disorders of jealousy...Lee Remick gives a sensational performance as the sexy wife whose missing panties form a vital part of the evidence... Remick knows how to attract and seduce... She is so coquettish that she drives her angry husband to murder... The trial poses tricky questions: Was the Remick character in advanced levels of seduction during her wanderings at the neighborhood bar? Did her bruises come from the man whom she claimed raped her, or from her jealous husband? George C. Scott plays the sly, sardonic prosecuting attorney who offers the character a wonderful air of arrogance and superiority, unnerving with his aggressive antagonism witnesses and defense attorney...Arthur O'Connell rises to the occasion when his lawyer-hero needs him...Eve Arden is Stewart's faithful and efficient secretary eager that the Manion case might bring her a long-overdue paycheck... The courtroom fencing between Stewart and Scott is so convincing with the casting of Joseph N. Welch as the delightful ever-patient judge, Harlan Weaver... Judge Weaver, whose patience is repeatedly tried by the grotesque gestures of the lawyers in the case, appears too kindly to be much of a courtroom disciplinarian... But in the tension between the shrewd old judge and the lawyer for defense, the film raises a crucial issue on the rules of advocacy: To what extent a lawyer should represent a client zealously within the rules and norms of courtroom etiquette? Preminger's penchant for long takes and a mobile camera, rather than cuts and conversational reaction shots, here serves both to illuminate the crucial ambiguities in the characters, and to facilitate an objective appraisal of the mechanics of the legal process... Preminger challenges the American censors over the candid sexual terminology and explicit examination of rape in his courtroom drama... Ellington's score brilliantly captures the tension and the moral ambiguity that characterize the movie... Sam Leavitt's black-and-white photography is particularly impressive, setting as it does the stark mood of the authentic Michigan locations...",

            "content": "Based on the famous Traver novel, ANATOMY OF A MURDER is an extremely complex film that defeats easy definition. In some respects it is a social document of the era in which it was made; primarily, however, it is a detailed portrait of the law at work and the mechanizations and motivations of the individuals involved in a seemingly straight-forward case. In the process it raises certain ethical issues re attorney behavior and the lengths to which an attorney might go to win a case.Paul Biegler (James Stewart) is a small-town lawyer who has recently lost a re-election for the position of District Attorney and who is down on his luck--when a headline-making case involving assault, alleged rape, and murder drops into his lap. As the case evolves, there is no question about the identity of the killer. But a smart lawyer might be able to get him off just the same and redeem his own career in the process, and with the aid of an old friend (Arthur O'Connell) and his formidable secretary (Eve Arden), Biegler sets out to do precisely that. Opposing him in the courtroom is Claude Dancer (George C. Scott), a high powered prosecutor who is equally determined to get a conviction... and who is no more adverse to coaching a witness than Biegler himself. The two square off in a constantly shifting battle for the jury, a battle that often consists of underhanded tactics on both sides.The performances are impressive, with James Stewart ideally cast as the attorney for the defense, Ben Gazzara as his unsavory client, and a truly brilliant Lee Remick as the sexy and disreputable wife who screams rape where just possibly none occurred; O'Connell, Arden, and Scott also offer superior performances. The script is sharp, cool, and meticulous, the direction and cinematography both effective and completely unobtrusive, and the famous jazz score adds quite a bit to the film as a whole.Although we can't help rooting for Stewart, as the film progresses it seems more and more likely that Remick is lying through her teeth and Gazzara is as guilty as sin--but the film balances its elements in such a way as to achieve a disturbing ambiguity that continues right through to the end. If you expect a courtroom thriller with sudden revelations and twists you'll likely be disappointed in ANATOMY OF A MURDER, but if you want a thought-provoking take on the law you'd be hard pressed to find one better.

            "content": "Lawyer Paul Biegler takes the case of Lt. Manion who killed a man after he discovered he had raped his wife, Laura.  Biegler realises that the cards are not all in his favour and begins to ensure that the facts are spun in his favour as much as possible during the trial.This film caused a stir back when it was released \u0096 supposedly over the dialogue that contained words not used before in a motion picture.  However it was more likely that the furore was over the cynical view of the legal profession that the film has.  The story is good, but if you're looking for a John Grisham type film with shouting and ridiculous twists in the final reel then you're in the wrong place.  What we have here is a clever, interesting story that moves slowly \u0096 focusing on Biegler rather than twists and turns in the actual plot.Biegler is sort of clean cut, but he seems like a real lawyer \u0096 he twists facts and prompts lies in order to improve his case.  The various tricks and theatrical shenanigans during the trail are also well observed.  The characters are all interesting with only the judge seeming like a dull stereotype.James Stewart is excellent and helps make the shifty lawyer more likeable and relatable.  Remick is excellent as the flirtatious Laura while Gazzara is cool as the accused.  George C Scott doesn't have much to do, but does well anyway.Overall a very enjoyable courtroom thriller \u0096 it lacks the fireworks of modern legal dramas but has a nice cynical edge to it that shows it isn't as in awe of the law as Grisham is.",

            "review_title": "Gray Anatomy",
            "content": "Anatomy Of a Murder is probably Otto Preminger's best film. It's certainly my favorite. Adapted from a novel by Robert Traver, it tells the story of a lawyer in northern Michigan and his defense of a particularly surly and violent murderer. As is always the case with Preminger, scenes are filmed mostly with all the characters present in the frame. There is no cross-cutting to speak of, which is to say the drama plays out with the assorted characters confronting one another, or at any rate with one another, and the effect is one of surprising warmth and good feeling in the movie's cosier scenes, which for once enhance rather than detract from the drama. I would have been quite happy to have spent much more time in lawyer Biegler's house and study, with its books, old furniture and broken typewriter, but alas this is a murder case so one has to get down to businss. The question of whether the defendant, an army officer, was temporarily insane, is in fact insane, or is merely putting on a good show, is never fully resolved. The lawyer is by no means perfect. He's a little lazy, though he gets over it. One senses he's cheap. He enjoys his shabby genteel bachelor's life and isn't always responsive to the needs of his secretary, who would like to get paid more regularly. In the end he proves far more dedicated and brilliant than we might have first imagined him to be, but the fly in the buttermilk is that the better he gets the more complicated the case becomes, and the more ambiguous everything gets the more he finds out about his client and the man he killed. In this respect the movie is a masterpiece of ambiguity. Beautifully shot on location in black and white, it is more gray than anything else. Morally gray. No one is quite what he appears to be at first. And people change; or rather we learn more about them. The bartender at the resort where his boss was killed at first comes off as a jerk; in time he comes to seem more of a jerk. Then he seems maybe not so bad after all; and then he's a jerk once more, but a jerk we understand. The lawyer's assistant, an on-again, off-again recovering alcoholic, is also a mixed bag. He is dogged but sloppy, and always (or so it appears) on the verge of breakdown. Or at least this is how Arthur O'Connell plays him. The prosecuting attorney is a dolt, but he is aided by a legal bigwig the state has brought in, but this hotshot is no match for the cunning country lawyer. The defendant's wife, who 'started the whole thing' is gorgeous, sexy and provocative. She makes a play for her husband's lawyer, but he doesn't bite. One wonders about her. And one wonders about the marriage she and her hot-tempered spouse really have, and whether it will last. This is a very sophisticated and adult movie for 1959, or for that matter today. The location filming greatly enhances the mood, chilly and very upper midwestern. Yet indoors one feels different, and the tone is often playful. The actors are superb. James Stewart is gritty, lovable, homespun, physically slow and mentally quick; and for all the familiarity there is about his screen persona, out of character, that is, in character he manages continually to surprise and delight. He was a true actor. Ben Gazzara is very Method actorish, which suits him well in his role as the volatile military man. Lee Remick is stunning as his wife, and one can well imagine a man killing for her, many times over. She is also a good actress. George C. Scott plays the state's bulldog prosecutor well, though he's an acquired taste at best. His hamminess contrasts with Stewart's folksy naturalism in interesting ways not ungermane to the plot, but he is out-acted and outclassed by the old pro he is presumably upstaging in this film.",

            "review_title": "One classy, sophisticated and entertaining courtroom drama",
            "content": "Along with Witness for the Prosecution, this is a serious contender for the best courtroom drama on film. What makes it so? It is classy, it is sophisticated and it is entertaining. The story about a man accused of murdering another man after he supposedly rapes his wife is original, suspenseful and never runs out of steam. The screenplay is inventive, and while it is sophisticated and serious, it also manages to be quite funny. The character of Paul Biegler gets the best of them, including \"If you do that one more time, I'll punch you all the way out into the middle of Lake Superior\", \"All right, the cat's out of the bag; it's fair game for me to chase it\" and \"Well it's like trying the take the core from the apple without breaking the skin\". The cinematography is fabulous, and the score by Duke Ellington is wonderful. As for the performances, I don't think there was a bad performance at all. James Stewart, the fine actor he was, seems to be really enjoying himself as the shifty Paul Biegler, and Joseph N. Welch in one of his last roles is sensational as Judge Weaver. Lee Remick is stunningly beautiful and seductive as Laura, and while George C.Scott, yet another fine actor, has a little less to do, he still brings sly and sardonic wit to his role. And Ben Gazzara plays his problematic client part to a tee. The courtroom scenes especially were a genuine joy to watch. All in all, a real delight to watch, and I strongly recommend it. The ending does disappoint, but the performances and the sheer entertainment value of the courtroom scenes more than compensate. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "review_title": "First-Class Courtroom Drama",
            "content": "As a courtroom drama, \"Anatomy of a Murder\" would be hard to surpass. It is a first-class production with an interesting and unpredictable story plus a strong cast. It works admirably, both as a story and as a portrayal of the workings of the law. It avoids the labored dramatics and contrived resolutions in which so many movies of the genre indulge, and it also declines to shy away from pointing out the more ill-conceived features of the legal system.From his first scene, James Stewart pulls the viewer right into the world of lawyer Paul Biegler. It takes little time before you come to know him and to get a pretty good idea of what his life is like. His scenes with Arthur O'Connell work well in rounding out the picture. The two are neither heroic nor brilliant, but simply sympathetic and believable.Into Biegler's world then come the characters played by Ben Gazzara and Lee Remick, a married couple with more than their share of faults. By making them less than ideal clients, the movie takes a chance on losing the audience's sympathy, but it adds credibility and complexity to the story. Both roles are played well - again, it seems as if you know a lot more about them than is specifically stated.When George C. Scott enters the picture, he adds yet another dimension. His character arrives at just the right time to complicate the plot, and his legal skirmishing with Stewart makes some dry material come to life in an interesting way. Eve Arden also has some good moments, and her character is used in just the right amount to add some amusement without causing a distraction from the main story. It's also interesting to see Joseph Welch as the judge, and his portrayal works well enough.Otto Preminger holds everything together nicely, with the right amount of detail and a pace that keeps the story moving steadily. The result is a very nice contrast to the many run-of-the mill legal/courtroom movies that present such an idealized view of the justice system. It maintains a careful balance, making clear the flaws and unpleasant realities of the system, yet never taking cheap shots either. And it's also an interesting and involved story, one of the most carefully-crafted of its kind.",

            "review_title": "A Spot-On Courtroom Drama",
            "content": "Anatomy of an excellent movie:Begin with an extremely tight and well written script, from the novel by the same name. While reportedly the story is based on a real-life case it is nevertheless a timeless story, almost biblical, presenting age-old questions of human conflicts and human dilemmas. Add to that a sensational cast, starting of course with the leads, Jimmy Stewart, George C. Scott, Lee Remick, and Ben Gazarra, but also the rest of the cast, filled as it is with numerous accomplished and veteran stage actors and radio performers from days of yore. Character parts played by actors Arthur O'Connell, Eve Arden, Ken Lynch, Joseph Kearns, and Howard McNear. Someone paid careful attention to the casting for this film.Perhaps the most masterful stroke as far as casting goes was the casting Joseph Welch as the judge. Welch was an experienced and renowned lawyer in real life. Welch turns in a very good and a very believable performance.With the collision of those elements, a great script and a great cast, adding Otto Preminger as director, an overseer who knew exactly what to do with it all, you then have a very fine film.More than any other movie or play, including modern day presentations like the television series Law & Order, this 1959 movie, Anatomy of a Murder, even though it is now 46 years old, is by far the most realistic and technically accurate courtroom drama ever produced. The conduct of the trial, the examination of the witnesses, the colloquy and bantering back and forth between the lawyers and between the lawyers and the judge, is spot-on. Every bit of it. Every question from the lawyers, every objection, every ruling by the judge, every admonishment from the judge, and the testimony of the witnesses, every bit of it, is realistic and believable, lines that were accurately written with care, and then flawlessly delivered.Beyond the technical accuracies of the legal proceedings, some other aspects of the overall story were also spot on. The ambiguous ambivalence of lawyers, their motivations, their ethics, their relative honesty. Nothing is all black or all white. Shades of gray abound. Legal cases as sport. Being a \"good lawyer\" means pushing the envelope too far, bending the rules until you're told to stop. Not for justice. No, not that. To win. That's why. To win. Then sanctimoniously telling themselves that the system really works better this way. The movie accurately captures the fact that real-life legal cases are very often comprised of upside down Alice in Wonderland features. Innocent people are guilty, and guilty people are innocent. Good is bad, and bad is good. Everything is relative. Some call it cynicism. Others, cynically, call it realism. Anatomy of a Murder captures all of these and more.I've read the criticism that Lee Remick was not believable, that as an actress she failed at nailing the portrayal of how a true rape victim would appear and behave, and that her character, Laura Manion, just didn't seem to have the proper affect nor strike the right emotional chord of a woman who had been raped. All I can say is that such criticism misses a humongous part of the point. It is almost mind-boggling that there are viewers out there who, after viewing this film, somehow managed to miss it. Let me clear it up: we the viewers WERE SUPPOSED to have serious doubts about whether Laura Manion had actually been raped. The question of whether she was really raped or not is central to the plot and story line. That's why Lee Remick played the part the way she did. And then, in turn, it was part of the story for the Jimmy Stewart character, Paul Biegler, to recognize this problem, and the problem that it presented to his defense. He worried that the jury would see it and would also doubt that she had been raped, and so that's why he propped her up in court, dressed up all prim and proper, with a hat over her voluptuously cascading hair, and with horned-rim glasses. So, yes, Lee Remick nailed it. Bull's eye.Speaking of Lee Remick, some say that this was the movie that put Lee Remick on the map. She was stunningly beautiful here, at the ripe young age of 24. Even though the film is in black and white, her red hair, blue eyes, and porcelain skin still manage to jump right off the screen and out at you. Has any other actress ever played the role of the beautiful and sexy lady looking to get laid any better than Lee Remick? It was a woman she reprised several times in her career, sometimes with greater subtlety and understatement than others. This was her first rendition of it, and it may have been the best.Anatomy of a Murder is a very complex movie, with multitudes of layers and texturing, where much is deftly explored, but precious little is resolved. It's a movie that leaves you thinking and wondering. I highly recommend it.",

You're going to want to own your own copy, since this exciting courtroom drama can be enjoyed over and over again. I've lost track of how many times I've seen it, and it never gets old. I'm a huge fan of the boundary-pushing director Otto Preminger, and he once again pushed the envelope of the censors in 1959. In this movie, the words \"rape\" and \"panties\" are spoken several times - shocking at that time!James Stewart, in his silver-haired charm, stars as a defense attorney with passions outside the courtroom. He loves fishing, he loves jazz music, and he loves the sight of a good-looking woman. When the latter appears in his office, in the form of Lee Remick, asking for his help in her husband's upcoming trial, he agrees to take the case. Lee is beautiful and sexy, and she brings out such a flirtatious spark in Jimmy. Her husband, Ben Gazarra, will be on trial for murdering the man who raped and beat her up. It seems like an easy case, right? Not exactly.There's much more to the situation than meets the eye. As Jimmy explains to Ben on their first, memorable meeting: \"There are four ways I can defend murder. . .\" I love that scene. It's clever and concise without seeming glib or artificial. The chemistry between every member of the cast is so electric, you can feel the words bouncing off the actors. Jimmy and Ben spar with their eyes, George C. Scott and Jimmy love to hate each other, and George practically undresses Lee with his words. Who knew a murder trial could have so much sex appeal?The script is intelligent, the performances are energetic, and the subject matter is modern for its time. There are so many reasons to watch it, and so many things to appreciate when you do watch it, that you'll keep coming back to it over the years as I have.",

            "content": "Most of Preminger's films haven't aged well, but this one still works, thanks mostly to the casting of Jimmy Stewart and Geroge C Scott. Stewart, much like Henry Fonda in \"12 Angry Men\", commands the stage. He's an iconic actor, and every moment he's on screen tingles with a sort of fun electricity.But the problem with old crime films and courtroom dramas is that they've now been done to death. Every TV show, from \"Law and Order\" to \"Columbo\", has squeezed the life out of the genre. Most of these TV shows offer far cleverer scripts.\"Anatomy of a Murder\" still packs a punch, though. It's filled with a nice sense of sexuality, a riveting trial scene and some pretty risqu\u00e9 dialogue. The script, which focuses on rape, sexual assault and abuse, was very daring at the time. Preminger even sly acknowledges that his film was uncomfortably near to violating the Production Code by having his characters debate the proper way of referring to a pair of panties in court. Is this allowed, they ask, or is it going over the top? The plot is the usual murder mystery fare, but there's a nice sense of ambiguity. Nothing is clearly resolved, and the moral waters are very murky. In the end, we aren't quite sure whether justice has actually been served.Premminger - usually a very flat director - maneuvers his camera with skill during the courtroom sequences, juggling angles and making the most of the small spaces. Architecturally, it's not as brilliant as what Lumet did in \"12 Angry Men\", but it's still pretty entertaining.But the film's real star is Jimmy Stewart. Stewart plays the usual country lawyer archetype, but though he appears easy going, he reveals some impressive fangs when challenged. It's a far cry from Capra's small-town lawyers. Issues are never clear-cut, characters are always morally ambiguous, and everyone seems to have a nasty streak.7.5/10 - I generally don't like Otto Preminger, but this film held my interest. It's not as good as Lumet's \"12 Angry Men\" or \"The Verdict\", but it still works, thanks largely to the ever reliable Jimmy Stewart.",

Lee Remick is seen establishing her early image as the somehow fragile, undeniably seductive pawn (see also \"A Face in The Crowd\"), while Gazzara wavers intensely somewhere between heartless murderer and protective husband.  The supporting cast is strong, creating a human backdrop for the senior players, keeping the story in the real world,  effectively preventing this from becoming an exercise in legal theory.This film is noteworthy for a myriad of reasons, but most specifically because it addresses the still controversial issue of acquaintance rape, and presents us with a victim of questionable morals.  At the same time our murder victim is seen as a monster, then a friend and father. There really are no heroes here, no noble defenders, no pristine heroines, no completely innocent bystanders...both sides take their turns pointing fingers, each claiming that the other only got what they deserved.We are forced to re-evaluate our thoughts on what constitutes justifiable homicide--the unwritten law that Manion speaks of in the film versus the law as written that Biegler must now interpret.  This manipulation of intended meaning sets a somewhat tragic precedent evident in the legal system we work within today.This film is highly entertaining, and excellent for discussion.

It is one of the first films I've ever heard describe the details of a rape in graphic terms, and it must have been pretty shocking in 1959.The film revolves around attorney James Stewart's reluctant taking on of Ben Gazzara's case of murdering the man who allegedly raped his wife. The beautiful Lee Remick must relive the horror as the prosecution, led by Brooks West with assistance by guest attorney Scott, seems to be determined to prove that something is being kept from the court and break the case of temporary insanity on Gazzara's behalf. As more information comes out on Remick's past, the doubts of her story take over the case.Desperate for a case to make some money and pay his staff, Stewart can't afford to take this case but he also can't afford not to because of what he believes as far as the reasoning behind the murder. There's no doubt that Gazzara killed a man. The doubt comes from Remick's sincerity, a controversial subject then and now. Much of the court case surrounds the missing evidence of Remick's missing undergarments, which creates a bit of juvenile laughter in the courtroom.In spite of the length of the film, this flows by with humor thanks to the irony of some of the things going on behind the scenes and in court. There's more to Eve Arden as Stewart's loyal assistant than the wisecracks as she works hard to aide Stewart in collecting necessary information for his defense. Arthur O'Connell, an aging attorney with a drinking problem, also figures prominently in the story as well, causing worry when he disappears for no reason.Much of the cast were praised in this film season with various Award nominations even outside of the oscars, and Stewart, Scott and O'Connell did receive Oscar nominations. Scott, already well known for his stage and TV work smoothly moved into film with his calculating performance, his trademark grin prominently featured as he questions several witnesses in acerbic ways.Leave it to Otto Preminger for bringing something as controversial like this to the screen. Only someone with his desire to present such situations in harsh realistic terms could dare to face the censors. Joseph N. Welch, a real life controversial attorney in the McCarthy trials, is superb as the judge taking the case, providing humor and frustration, and totally commanding and stealing the scene every time the camera flashes on him. This film is practically perfect in every way and will keep you gripped from beginning to end, one of the finest court dramas ever released in the cinema.",

            "content": "This might have been a stunning movie for 1959, but I fail to see how it holds up in the Twenty First Century. If one could get away with a murder rap using that 'irresistible impulse' argument, I think there would be a lot more murder trials today, not to mention a whole lot more killers running around loose. I mean really, a 'psychic shock' which creates an almost overwhelming tension which a person must alleviate, by KILLING SOMEBODY!!! I know there are real live cases of temporary insanity that have gotten people off the hook, but in those situations, the accused is usually deranged enough to merit the argument. I don't see how it worked here, except of course, as being a product of it's times.Even the courtroom drama seemed a little bizarre to me. I can understand the prosecuting attorney Mitch Lodwick (Brooks West) making all those challenges to Paul Biegler's (James Stewart) questioning of witnesses, but couldn't figure out why he thought they were out of bounds. Why wouldn't the alleged rape of Manion's (Ben Gazzara) wife be relevant to the case? It's why he killed bar owner Quill! Or the photographer's pictures of Laura Manion (Lee Remick). If they could corroborate the fact that she got beat up by Quill, even if she wasn't raped, putting them into evidence should have been a no-brainer.There's also that scene in which Mary Pilant (Kathryn Grant) rolled over so easily when Biegler asked her to get the bartender to cooperate with his investigation. Any other person would have told the attorney to take a hike if it was going to implicate her own father. That scene just didn't pass the smell test for me.But with all that, I still thought the film was fairly compelling in the way Biegler sniffed out his opportunities and played them out for the court. Some of his over the top antics didn't seem realistic but he was putting on a show for the jurors. I liked Judge Weaver (Joseph N. Welch) by the way, I was surprised to learn he was a real life attorney during the Army-McCarthy hearings. No wonder he seemed so credible in the role of the judge.The most surprising thing about the movie for me was the way it handled some of the era's sensitive subjects like rape, women's undergarments, and male sperm as evidence in an abuse case. Don't forget, this was the tail end of a decade when the Ricardo's slept in separate beds and topics involving sex were still taboo subjects for TV. The dialog in the film was credibly done without getting sensational, so that was a plus.The thing that really got me though, no one even mentioned in a couple dozen reviews of the picture I read on this board. When all was said and done, and after Manion was found not guilty, Jimmy Stewart's character arrives at the trashy trailer park and gets handed that message about Manion's irresistible impulse to hit the road. The guy scammed Biegler, the court, and the jury, and got away with murder! Time to go fishing, I guess.",

            "content": "Thoroughly engrossing courtroom drama, famous as much for its adult subject matter and use of \"dirty\" language as anything else. It has some casting faults but equally there is some memorable playing, especially in the artifice-free courtroom finale played out over several tense minutes.Let's deal with the subject matter and language issues. It must have come as a shock to middle and upper-class Americans at the end of Eisenhower's second term to be faced with a film which examines in some, if not gory detail, the possible rape of a, let's be generous, flighty but pretty young wife of a Korean War vet who, after the alleged act, cold-bloodedly shoots down the so-called perpetrator out of revenge, jealousy or was it temporary madness. No stranger to controversy, Otto Preminger pushes the envelope all the way home here, making an epochal film on the cusp of the permissive 60's, dragging America into the modern world. Hitchcock, another well-known agent-provocateur perhaps following the lead here, would take it further next year by showing Janet Leigh in her bra, taking part in a clandestine affair. As for the use of everyday vernacular in employing strong terminology for the time, with words like bitch, sperm, rape and of course panties, while they're obviously inserted for shock value, they nevertheless ground the film in realism even if the last of them is probably over-used.Some of the characterisations, I felt, worked, some didn't. James Stewart sees it through gamely but I sense a mis-casting and why he has to be saddled with a clich\u00e9d drunken Dr Watson-type as his assistant, I don't know. Better are the performances of a young George C Scott and Lee Remick as the slimy prosecutor and floozy housewife respectively, their climactic exchanges being absolutely electric, while there's a performance of great subtlety and nuance by Joseph N Welch as the fair-minded judge.So did the trailer park trash-couple get away with it? Preminger leaves that open and bravely eschews the use of flashback to give us no easy answers. The film's at its best in the court scenes, less so in its depiction of small-town Americana but I was certainly gripped by the last 45 minutes in particular and will give it more than the benefit of the doubt in that regard.",

            "content": "Fantastic acting, excellent shots on location in Michigan, entertaining courtroom scenes, but a flawed script, and a little overrated. The premise is simple. A former prosecutor (Jimmy Stewart) is convinced to come out of retirement to defend a man (Ben Gazzara) accused of murder. There really isn't any doubt he's done it, since he's confessed. After some encouragement from Stewart, his plea is not guilty by reason of temporary insanity, that he simply 'lost it' after finding out that his wife (Lee Remick) was raped, and went out and killed the guy.Stewart turns in an outstanding performance, effortlessly combining intelligence and wit, and sparring with the prosecutor brought in from Lansing (George C. Scott). The scene where he questions his own client after a surprise piece of evidence is introduced by another inmate, real doubt in his eyes, is wonderful. Scott is also brilliant, sharp and reptilian, quickly surpassing the local prosecutor. The scene where he deliberately moves back and forth to obscure Stewart's view of a witness is great, and well shot by director Otto Preminger. Joseph N. Welch as the judge is also strong and such a natural, in one scene appearing in the background with this arm wrapped around his head so that his hand rests on his opposite cheek as he listens intently. It was also nice to hear jazz from Duke Ellington, and in one scene to see him playing briefly with Jimmy Stewart, though I'm not sure the music always fits.The trouble is, even if this is based on a real case, legally and morally, it's a mess. I certainly didn't want Stewart as protagonist in the role of the defense attorney, where it feels he's in the wrong, starting with him nudging the guy to claim he was temporarily insane. It's apparent that the only real question is whether that was true, and yet, most of the trial revolves around whether his wife was actually raped, and worse yet, what her possible culpability was in that. Was she wearing clothing that was too suggestive, was she promiscuous, etc. Even if you can get past the misogyny of attacking a rape victim, which is a disturbing reality, it's absurd to me that it became so central to the trial, Stewart's 'apple core' argument notwithstanding. Also, her missing panties get far too much attention throughout the movie, including the dramatic find at the end, when they're irrelevant. In tone, there are several aspects that didn't ring true. Remick's playfulness and flirtation with Stewart a short while after being brutally beaten and raped, and with her husband charged with murder. The victim's daughter (played unconvincingly by a constantly wide-eyed Kathryn Grant) remotely considering helping the defense. The level of levity in the courtroom for a trial involving rape and murder. In one absurd sidebar, the judge and attorneys sidebar to discuss what panties should be referred to as. With a very serious look on his face, Scott says \"When I was overseas during the war, Your Honor, I learned a French word. I'm afraid that might be slightly suggestive\", to which the Welch replies \"Most French words are\". The courtroom then cracks up when he announces that the garment in question will be referred to as panties. More than once, one attorney or another is surprised by a witness being produced, without having had a chance to independently interview them. More than once, an attorney will ask a question that he clearly doesn't know the answer to, one that he has no business asking. Most likely, Preminger amplified all of these theatrics - the jokes, the obsession with Remick and her panties, the banter between attorneys, the little doggie inexplicably being brought into the trial so he can jump up into Stewart's arms - all for entertainment value. The central theme of what justice should be doesn't get explored enough. Perhaps that's Preminger's point, that in the circus of a trial with sharp minds on both sides, circling each other like sharks, the system of justice is fallible. If it was though, the ending doesn't bear that out. During the 160 minute run time, I kept hoping for a plot twist that never came. That the guy doesn't just skip out on his bill at the end, he kills his wife in a rage, and calmly deadpans that he did that one too because of an \"irresistible impulse\". That the wife reveals she was never raped that night, and manipulated her husband into killing. That either the fellow bartender or the victim's daughter were somehow involved in a setup, for the money. Nope. As it is, Stewart's a hero, and if anyone has any qualms about it, they try to pin a happy face on the whole thing by saying his next case is going to be helping the victim's daughter with her estate. Oh, wow, well that makes it all right then, and let's all leave the theater happy. The film is still worth seeing for the performances - Stewart at 51 is still quite an actor, and endearing as well - but prepare to be conflicted, and a little irritated.",

I became aware of the following information while attending Northern Michigan University in Marquette, MI over a few tall drinks with John D. Volker, the author, years ago.This great courtroom drama is set in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. To be more specific the cities of Marquette, Negaunee and Ishpeming and the village of Big Bay and is based on a true murder case that took place there. The names of the cities and people are changed in the movie but it is filmed on the same locations that the murder case took place. The screenplay was written by John D. Volker (who wrote his novels under the pen name Robert Travers) and was based on his first novel. He was from Ishpeming (Iron City in the movie) and a Michigan Supreme Court Justice when he reviewed the appeal of this case and turned it into a detailed novel and then screenplay. The movie is given an extra dose of authenticity by using the unique people of the Upper Peninsula as extras and in minor roles. The point of all this historical information is that along with a hard hitting realistic style by director Otto Premenger, great score by Duke Ellington, plus top notch true to life performances by the excellent cast (Jimmy Stewart, Ben Gazara, Lee Remick, George C. Scott, et.al) this black and white film is more reality than fiction and being aware of this adds to impact of this psychological courtroom drama. This is a true human experience written by an author from the area directly from the original court transcripts, filmed where it happened in a style that fits the subject matter where it actually happened with a cast that really knows what they are doing.

And this is under the larger branch of the detective narrative, that one where there is a special agreement with viewer about rules.Since the late 50s, detective>courtroom>drunk lawyer movies have been about playing with the rules instead of using them. This is among the first.A case passes through the world of two slackers, hardly leaving a dent. It is never resolved. The ambiguities are subtle but significant.There are some interesting things here. The first is how dated is the sexuality. This was considered risqu\u00e9 in its time. Lee Remick was considered dangerously sexy. How tame that is now.There are other weaknesses, the hackneyed portrayal of the drunk lawyer. The mishandling of languid pacing. But there is a good performance from Stewart, perhaps his best. The integration of music and vision is still among the very best we have, and the music itself still snaps if Remick does not.You should see this though because of how masterfully the scenes are staged, Even the courtroom scenes, \u0097 traditionally as difficult as staging family meals \u0097 have some novelty, now much copied.

It did not have the ongoing twists like \"Witness for the Prosecution\", character oriented or plot driven. Nor was it a movie with the compelling, issue ploughing story line like \"To Kill a Mockingbird\". At the same time, it lacked historical interest, but the incredibly dramatised realism of \"Judgement at Nuremberg\". Instead, I thought, a film with a two and a half hour run time, and I hate sitting in front of movies running longer than two hours as it is!I found it, but it took me a while to realise the one great asset this movie had. Jimmy Stewart.Without a doubt, this engrossing movie about rape, murder and law evoked memories of a Jimmy Stewart seen twenty years earlier in \"Mr Smith Goes to Washington\". The small town, humble, idealised man who triumphs over the hard headed city men. In a sense, almost the \"It's a Wonderful Life\" of 1959 with no angels, no attempted suicides, no wonderful, sentimental, reminding message of what life is about. One of the best things about the movie is the Duke Ellington score. The brass jazz sounds against the actual darkness of the plot completely and totally surprised me, it being so different to the usual dark sombre tones, screeching string instruments trying to stir suspense in the audience.\nSupporting cast is great. Lee Remick, Eve Arden, Arthur O'Connell and George C. Scott all put in great performances. But I enjoyed Jimmy very much as the fisherman, lively, wise cracking lawyer. Otto Preminger directed \"Laura\" fifteen years earlier. Seems a bit like similar plot lines. Beautiful woman caught up in murder, men lusting after beautiful woman, continual plot turns and all the rest. But Preminger directed this film well. What did I find by the end? I found some of the the sarcastic suspense in Jimmy and the film, similar to Billy Wilder's \"Witness for the Prosecution\". The drama was just as alive as it was with \"Judgement at Nuremberg\". I found myself pulled in as much as I was with \"To Kill a Mockingbird\". In short, I really recommend this film to everyone who enjoys a few thrills and suspense.In fact, I liked it so much, I'm going to read the book.Rating: 9/10",

            "content": "It's hard to think of any film that can surpass Otto Preminger's superb courtroom drama. Having seen this film countless times now, I'm hooked, each time I see it. Usually I find most courtroom dramas not all that fascinating. Most of them work up to the point they enter the courtroom, after which most of the sparkle disappears. That's definitely not the case in this film. The writing is just as riveting (I don't think it's dated, and in a way, every film is dated) as it was back then and the film is greatly boosted by a fantastic cast led by Stewart in perhaps the best role of his career and that says something. It's a long film (160 min) but I never even notice the lengthy running time. It could go on for two hours more as far as I'm concerned.The film is set in Thunder Bay in Northern Michigan, a town that lives mainly of tourism and the nearby army base. Stewart plays Paul Biegler, an easy-going small town Michigan lawyer at the dawn of his career, who likes to spend his spare time going fishing and play a tune on the piano once in a while to relax himself. One day, he is called by a young woman (Lee Remick) to defend the case of her husband, an army lieutenant (Ben Gazzara), who is accused of murdering the rapist of his beautiful seductive wife. He decides to take the case, but the prosecution calls in reinforcements from Lansing in the person of big-city prosecutor George C. Scott, who claims it's a case of cold blooded murder. The unfolding of the story with captivating new insights after each new witness and several surprising twists and turns will have you glued to your seat. The courtroom theatrics are outrageous and they would probably never be allowed in a real courtroom, as the two lawyers try everything, even the lowest tricks in the book, to make their case. The cross-examinations are riveting and at times very funny. Preminger mainly uses long takes without too much cross-cutting and close-ups and in every take there's something droll, like the courtroom scene where George C. Scott continuously tries to block the view between Stewart and Remick, when he questions her on the stand. Strangely enough, when Stewart bursts out in protest about this behaviour, it becomes even funnier, when the two lawyers start bickering at each other in high fashion.Arthur O'Connell is simply fantastic as Stewart's alcoholic sidekick, and Eve Arden is equally memorable as his cynical lace-tongued secretary hoping to receive her long-due paycheck with this case. Real-life judge Joseph N. Welch is a marvel to watch in his role as Judge Weaver. Welch got most famous in real life, because he stood up against communist witch hunter senator McCarthy during the Army hearings and told him on live television, \"Have you no sense of decency, sir?\"Duke Ellington provided the score and also makes a brief appearance behind the piano in a nightly bar scene.This is as good as it gets, extremely well written, superbly acted, directed, scored, every minute of it is supremely entertaining.

Small-time lawyer as well as ex-prosecutor James Stewart living in Northern Michigan takes on a twisted case through a tangle of violation and murder, as he defends an Army Lieutenant, Ben Gazzarra, accused for murder, as he is suspect to have killed a man who raped his philander wife, Lee Remick.Cynical and provoking portrayal of the criminal court focusing the interplay among the various courtroom roles. The movie gets an exciting battle of wits between the obstinate lawyer Stewart and the clever prosecutor George C Scott. At the time the film was very controversial and explosive due to engaging stuff and strong language, though tame by today's standars. Based on actual events, in fact it was written by judge Robert Traver, author of a notorious bestseller. Terrific acting by James Stewart as brilliant, slow-talking advocate at law picking his way determinedly who faces George C Scott as the intelligent prosecutor who attempts the suspect to be condemned at whatever means. Special mention for Lee Remick as the explosive and hot spouse, Arthur O'connell as the friendly old colleague who is instantly likeable, Eve Arden as the madure, wisecracking helper and Joseph Welch as the sympathetic but rigid judge .Evocative and perfect cinematography in black and white by Sam Leavitt, being shot on location in upper Michigan. And appropriate and jazzy soundtrack by Duke Ellington who appears himself along with Stewart playing piano.

It's a pretty woodsy area as shown in the film with lots of tiny towns and villages and very right wing in its politics. A homicide occurred in one of those towns, an army lieutenant killed the owner of a nightspot who he says raped his wife. The lieutenant played by Ben Gazzara is in need of a good lawyer and he hires James Stewart who was the former prosecutor in the county. Stewart's team such as it is consists of secretary Eve Arden and former mentor Arthur O'Connell, a reformed alcoholic whose hold on reform is shaky to say the least.The prosecution consists of Brooks West and a hired gun from the attorney general's office George C. Scott. There's a lot of resentment against Scott in that maybe the locals don't like the inference their own prosecutor isn't up to the job.Anatomy of a Murder gets James Stewart into a courtroom for the only time in his film career though he did play lawyers in other films. He exudes the same kind of down home folksiness that characterized his later Hawkins TV series in the seventies. Otto Preminger took his cast and they operated like a finely tuned machine, they could have all been from the same repertoire company and played with each other for years. Anatomy of a Murder got seven Oscar nominations including one for James Stewart as Best Actor and George C. Scott and Arthur O'Connell in the Supporting Actor category. Unfortunately this was the year of Ben-Hur which blanked just about everyone else out of any awards which also included Best Picture and Best Director for Otto Preminger.Charlton Heston tells a story in his memoirs that Stewart on the night of the Oscars the following year told Heston he had voted for him and was pulling for him as he had already won one in The Philadelphia Story. Only a man of real class would have done that. Stewart was named Best Actor for 1959 by the New York Film Critics though.Besides all those previously mentioned, kudos should go to Lee Remick as Gazzara's slatternly wife and Kathryn Crosby as the deceased's roadhouse manager who provides some key last minute evidence at the trial.Anatomy of a Murder is one of the best courtroom dramas ever put on film, catch it by all means.",

Now he gets a huge case - an army Lieutenant has apparently murdered another man after that man allegedly raped his wife.

One of the reasons you can't look away is that Preminger wrings the maximum out of every scene and shot - great use of actor's body language and subtle little things that help the plot, mood and intrigue.Completing it all is the nagging feeling that you aren't sure whether the accused is guilty or not. There's no good guys vs bad guys, just prosecution vs defense (like in real life). It's this ambiguity and mystery that make the movie so gritty and utterly compelling. Anatomy of a Murder was nominated for seven Oscars in 1960, including for Best Picture, but won none. 1960 was the year of Ben Hur.",

Scott).A lesser, more obvious movie would have made the defendant a sympathetic, righteous avenger and his wife as pure as the driven snow; here they are both unsavory, untrustworthy types. And Biegler is not a man on a mission, just a professional who tries to do his job at the best of his considerable abilities. Stewart is wonderful, of course, and the rest of the cast is on par.9/10",

            "content": "The sly old German, Preminger, proves a hard nut to crack today as in 1959 when the film was first issued. This is a denunciation of the trial-by-jury system, and apparently continues playing on today's viewers the same tricks it played its original ones. A gin-drinking, tough, cold blooded beast of an army veteran, beats his wife black when he catches her cheating with the local barman, shoots the offender and forces her to swear on the rosary (she's a guilt ridden Catholic because she's divorced, and clings eagerly to her creed's symbols) to lie to the authorities, claiming she's been raped by her lover, so her brute of a husband manages to obtain an \"exception\" as \"temporarily insane\" (an 1885 case is unearthed to sustain the claims of his defense) and get away with the murder. Which he does, helped by a former prosecutor (Stewart) whose place is been held by \"an inferior mind\" today and needs to prove to the others and himself he's not finished. Helped also by a judge whose lenience is established once he understands the defense attorney to be an equally passionate fisherman as he. Time and again the jury is advised to \"disregard\" what they have heard, whenever \u0096 and it is very often \u0096 the defense systematically overrules court procedure and creates impressions that favor the accused \u0096 indeed this is a recurrent instance during that long trial. Everybody (but the average viewer!) is from a certain point on quite sure that the decorated soldier (excellent Gazzara) is guilty as charged, that his wife (equally excellent Lee Remick) is a loose morality woman, indeed a charming little harlot, that the murder has been one of cold premeditation and everybody is lying. But the system is such that impressions carry the day. This is a masterpiece of concealed realities and guilty consciences. As the defense lawyer and his \"assistant\" (his crony, a sympathetic old drunkard, as keen for success as is Stewart's lawyer) bless and praise juries while waiting for the verdict, as Stewart's faithful and likable secretary longs for victory only because she needs to see her long overdue paycheck made out to her, from the fee her employer is due to collect, Preminger is going all out to denounce the fallibility of the system in the most understated and at the same time the most deafening manner. I am amazed so few seem to realize this and lay instead the (great) value of that masterly directed, played and photographed film only to it's faithful, humorous, well paced and exciting depiction of the trial. This is a definite masterpiece of irony and hidden contempt, a movie angry as it is soft spoken and caressing both the public's sensibilities and the system's watchdogs \u0096 apparently very stern during the late 50s.",

Jimmy Stewart, at the peak of his craft (well before he had to \"re-invent\" himself a bad guy in westerns to stay in the biz) comes across as someone you went to school with, but forgot the name. He is so easy to identify with that you immediately start to see the whole film, the whole narrative, through his eyes. Which is precisely what Preminger intended. Lee Remick, short and sharp-featured, someone you might not notice in a crowd, shows the world the true meaning of \"charisma\" and steals every scene she is in. Only a star of this magnitude could say the word \"panties\" on screen and still make viewers blush decades into a new century. And Ben Gazarra, also at the peak of his craft (long before he started doing it \"for the money,\" like his work in Road House) fights Remick for audience attention on a scene by scene basis, and often wins.

            "content": "Otto Preminger's Anatomy of a Murder features a cast of some big stars (Jimmy Stewart, George C. Scott), and some notable character players (Ben Gazarra, Lee Remick, the underrated Murray Hamilton and Orson Bean), but the real big attraction for audience's is its 100% absorbing story and whole lot of characters (and, sometimes, those aforementioned actors playing them). It might remind some younger viewers of Law & Order, with it bearing a resemblance to Dick Wolf's show that is beat for beat as its sole fixation on the Facts In The Case. But unlike L&O, where any characterization is pretty much one-dimensional, Anatomy of a Murder is chock-full of development on the personalities, even for characters that appear on the witness stand for no more than five minutes.Preminger also has the daring to add some touches of comedy, or at least some (for the time) risqu\u00e9 humor and language that rises it not simply above other more standard pictures, but into a realm of truth that reflects what it's like to be in a court-room for a case such as this (i.e. when the judge addresses the courtroom about the use of the word \"panties\", he's also addressing the audience- don't giggle, it's a serious word... even if you might giggle for it being almost self-conscious). The premise itself, 'the core' of it for lack of a better term as from what Stewart's lawyer uses at one point, is something out of vintage L&O: an ex army lieutenant (Gazarra) with a possible penchant for tempers and jealousy, kills a man who raped his wife one night driving her home from a bar. Guilty of the murder? Not quite, says Stewart's defense attorney and jazzman Biegler, who goes for the temporary insanity defense.But past this premise, Preminger crafts a fascinating study of how character reflects everything during a trial, including (maybe even especially) that of the attorneys in question, who start to \"provide the wisecracks\" as the Judge says in deadpan. At first the case looks open and shut, but there's a lot more to it than meets the eye, and not just in the traditional form of a courtroom drama where there's a last-minute twist and some surprises in store for the jury and other attendees in the courtroom. And, sure, there is the former of those, but everything builds up not based solely on the facts, but on what is revealed, the underlying tension and anxiety for all parties involved. Stewart, of course, is up to task in one of his quintessential performances. But least not forget Gazarra in a role that should've nabbed him an Oscar, and for Remick who's Laura is both sultry and vulnerable. And who can't love seeing Hamilton (the mayor from Jaws) on the stand, or George C. Scott give a somewhat subdued portrayal that provides one of the slickest, most cunning prosecution parts in movies. He literally oozes his character's big-city gumption.Chock-full of snappy dialog that doesn't feel like it's been written for the usual MOVIE crowds (i.e. it is still a movie, but there's a lot that doesn't feel forced or contrived), and scenes that deliver on shifting tones between comedy and melodrama on a dime, Anatomy of a Murder is a near masterpiece. It even goes so far as to appear to have a happy ending, and then give just the hint of ambiguity, or inasmuch that we as the audience, unlike the jury, can't be totally sure what the outcome really is. It has its cake and eats it too, all to one of the great jazz scores in cinema by Mr. Ellington.",

            "content": "Bachelor lawyer Paul Biegler is hired to defend Lt. Frederick Manion, who has admitted murdering the man who raped his wife. The defence,? that Manion acted during temporary insanity.Few, if any courtroom dramas have the panache, daring and outright quality that Otto Preminger's genre bar raiser Anatomy Of A Murder has. Hiring Wendell Mayes for screenplay duties and entrusting the role of Biegler to James Stewart, Preminger's picture is still today influencing as much as it enthrals.Adapted from the novel of the same name by John D. Voelker {alias Robert Traver}, Anatomy Of A Murder is based around the real life 1952 Big Bay Lumberjack Tavern murder trial in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Choosing to shoot much of the film up in that neck of the woods, Preminger was determined to add authenticity to his excellently structured story. With some scenes even shot a short walk away from the actual Lumberjack Tavern in the Thunder Bay Inn. Aiding the authenticity is that Preminger cast Joseph N. Welch, a real life lawyer, in the role of Judge Weaver {tho Burl Ives and Spencer Tracy did turn down the job first}. Welch had made a notable name for himself when representing the U.S. Army in hearings conducted by Senator Joseph McCarthy.A number of things make Anatomy Of A Murder a classic among classics. From the snazzy Saul Bass opening title credits and the Duke Ellington jazzy score, it's clear this is no ordinary movie. Preminger had to fight tooth and nail with the Hays Code Censors to get his film the way he wanted, the result of which brings frank and daring dialogue featuring words such as \"panties,\" \"rape,\" \"contraceptives\" and \"spermatogenesis\". But perhaps most notable, and something of a masterstroke from big Otto, is that we are never shown the crime or influential points of reference. While you will search in vain for shots of the jury reactions during the trial. We as the viewers are part of that jury, much like them we are in the hands of the lawyers and witnesses, only difference being that we are privy to character back story with the principals. Yet it actually makes things harder for us such is the performances from the cast.Three of the male cast garnered Oscar nominations for their work in the film. James Stewart rewarded Preminger's faith with a fabulous show, his Biegler is gritty and determined, yet engagingly off beat as well. Up against him in the prosecution is a powerful and convincing George C. Scott as Asst. State Atty. Gen. Claude Dancer, whilst Arthur O'Connell as Parnell Emmett McCarthy delivers a memorable performance of substance. But it's with the warring Manions that the piece, played by Ben Gazzara as Frederick {tough, slick and shifty} and Lee Remick as Laura {slutty and duplicitous} achieves its crucial intrigue. Both actors are so good we all are not sure quite what to believe. With the intrigued capped off by a tantalisingly brilliant finale that drips with ambiguity and cheek.The film was also nominated for awards in the departments of adapted screenplay, cinematography and editing. That it won none is irrelevant {this was the year that Ben-Hur swept the board}, because Anatomy Of A Murder's lasting legacy is that it is still today held up as one of the genre's leading lights, and then some. 10/10",

            "content": "ANATOMY OF A MURDER was Otto Preminger's attempt to relate a subject hinted about in motion pictures, but rarely gone into great detail. The subject was rape and it's consequences, and how the rape victim frequently found herself under attack in our law courts when the issues of the case hinged on her moral innocence or guilt.The story takes place in the upper peninsula of Michigan, near a resort town. There is a military base nearby, and Ben Gazzara is a lieutenant there married to Lee Remick. It is the second marriage for both of them. Remick is extraordinary pretty, and her best features are highlighted by the tight fitting casual clothes she wears. She also is aware of how attractive she is to other men than her husband.One night, while Gazzara is sleeping after dinner, Remick goes to the local bar for some fun (austensibly drinking and playing pinball). She is playing it with the bar owner, who subsequently gives her a car ride home. Except for her pet dog, nobody witnesses what happens in the car - her story is that the man raped her twice, and she ran home and told her husband. Gazzara, one hour later, goes to the bar and shoots the owner five times.Was there a rape? The police made a cursory examination, and find that while there are some signs of a struggle, there is no trace of sperm. Remick's panties are missing, but they may just have been hidden by her. She did have some bruises (including one of her eye), but they could be due to a beating from anyone else. Gazzara is arrested and charged with the murder. And Remick calls in Jimmy Stewart.He was the former District Attorney for the town, but has been recently defeated after ten years of service. His staff consists of Eve Arden, and (when he sober) Arthur O'Connor. Stewart has handled prosecutions, and has never handled any criminal defense. He would not only face the current District Attorney (Brooks West) but an additional big city prosecutor (George C. Scott - in his first major movie role). Stewart finds that aside from the ironclad case the prosecution has, the lack of evidence conclusively showing a rape, and the time issue of one hour between said rape and the killing, prevent him putting forward a defense of temporary insanity. He also finds that both Gazzara and Remick are difficult figures to fit into a \"respectable\" couple image for what he has to do.There had been plenty of first rate courtroom dramas in previous years in the movies, such as THE STORY ON PAGE ONE and WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION, but nothing had been so carefully shown as this case was. The tactics of both defense and prosecution are demonstrated, with the careful maneuvering of questions and answers, and the attempt to probe for weaknesses in each other's cases. And Scott's cross-examination of Remick, bringing out her somewhat promiscuous character, reminds us of what usually happened (and still does) in rape cases. The character of the wise judge in the case was played by Joseph Welch, the Boston legal whiz who smashed Senator Joseph McCarthy to kindling very quietly and with dignity in 1954 at the Army-McCarthy hearings on television. Here, in his only movie role, Judge Welch shows the same courtly calm and dignity that adds to the sense of reality of the film.Well acted and directed this film has to be on anyone's list of top ten court room films.",

The one responsible, Army man Lt. Frederick Manion(Ben Gazzara)says he had couldn't control the impulse to kill Quill who had just a while before abused and raped his wife Laura(the lovely Lee Remick).Laura's character will be questioned and we do see she can be a flirter(mainly the way she behaves toward Paul). We also see that nasty streak that rises in Manion when someone seems to be offering lusty remarks or other ways of behavior toward his wife. These actions will leave opposing questions in the viewers mind to whether they are honest with Paul or holding back certain truths.Parn does some nosing around and finds out something regarding Mary Pilant(Kathryn Grant), a certain young woman Quill brought down from Ontario, Canada. Quill's bartender, Al(Murray Hamilton), knows certain things about the possible rape that could also hold a key to the guilt or innocence of Manion(..and how Laura might behave when loaded a bit with drink).Paul's opposing prosecution is two cunning lawyers who really give him one whale of a time during the trial. Asst. State Atty Gen. Dancer(George C Scott..his moments opposite Stewart are magic)will assist newly appointed DA, Mitch Lodwick(Brooks West, who shows his weariness of battle with Paul in that courtroom which can often wring sweat from any brow), who beat Paul soundly for his position.Outstanding courtroom drama..the best of it's kind. Eve Arden produces wonderful chemistry with Stewart and O'Connel, as Maida, Paul's secretary who hasn't received a check in some time, but stays pat with him hoping this case will bring them some kind of monetary gain. Joseph Welch is inspired casting(a real judge who brought down Joseph McCarthy)as Judge Weaver, the one man who exasperatingly tries to control his courtroom which can often turn into a circus with heated fireworks as both sides' attorneys duel.The film was quite controversial at the time for it's adult content along with specifics regarding taboo subjects at that time.",

            "content": "This movie doesn't try to get too complicated or smart with its themes or issues and the case in this movie, along with its characters seem like very random and standard ones. This is what mostly makes \"Anatomy of a Murder\" such a simple, great and effective one.What I like about this movie is that it's a movie without any high morals or a strong message in it. It's just a movie about a random case and the lawyer just takes the case because it's a case. He doesn't feel that strong to, at the cost of everything, try to proof the innocence of his client and he doesn't get emotionally involved with the case or any of its key players, like often movies normally try to attempt. Movies more often try to get you behind the defendant, or else at least his attorney and feel strongly for the case. But in this case the murder suspect isn't presented as being either totally innocent or not. He even isn't that sympathetic of a character and you question his motives and his defense, during his trail, at times throughout the movie.It's a movie that doesn't really sidetrack with its story and it's being kept as straight-forward as possible all. So no odd occurrences happening in this movie, that are unlikely to ever happen in real life. This, together with its absence sense of morality, together with guilt and compassion, make this movie a mostly throughout realistic one. This works really pleasant for the movie and really helps to get you drawn into the story and its characters.I basically love all court room themed movies and this movie has pretty much everything present I want from such a movie. Granted that this is the sort of movie that would had not been as good or interesting to watch if it had a completely unknown and bad cast in it.So yes, the movie definitely benefits from the presence of James Stewart, as the movie its defense attorney and it also has a quite solid supporting cast. Quite fun to also see George C. Scott and Ben Gazzara in some of the more early roles out of their career. Seems that Scott was still holding back a bit, since he didn't had of course that much of a status yet as an actor. It's probably one of the more sophisticated and 'clean, quiet', roles out of his career but it was also really great to see him like that for a change and it at the same time also shows his range and versatility as an actor, since he was great in this movie as well, playing this sort of character.For its time it also was a quite daring movie, regarding some of its, still at the time controversial subjects. The story is also a rape case, so it features lines regarding that subject as well. Of course rape was an already known issue at the time but it wasn't something that really got featured that explicitly yet in any sort of movie at the time, simply because it was something at the time that you just didn't really talked about. Again an example of how simple and effectively straight-forward the movie was being.Just like its story, the movie is also being kept simple in its style. No fancy tricks or out of the ordinary sequences and set up here, just some plain, good old average film-making, like you would learn at film-school.One great and effective movie within its genre.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

It also had a topic and some language that was new and \"daring\" for its era, which gained it more favor from the critics. Today, this would be like a Disney movie.It's a courtroom drama film that lasts almost three hours, but in its day did such a good job of entertaining and shocking people that time was not a problem. I mean, audiences back then were not used to hearing details of women's panties! The story bogs down, panties aside, big-time in the middle, which was tolerated 50 years ago but wouldn't be today. I found it fascinating, myself, but that was years ago. You can thank great acting and an interesting script for that. What it lacks, of course, is credibility (and justice).....but, hey, it's just a movie, right?Jimmy Stewart and George C. Scott are terrific as competing attorneys. Liberal Hollywood always takes the side of the accused so you know Stewart's role is going to be the likable one, a la Perry Mason, Matlock, Atticus Finch, etc. Nonetheless, acting from everyone in here makes you riveted to the screen. The language also was quite shocking for a 1959 film, in addition to rape details. A few examples were hearing the words \"bitch\" and \"sperm.\"This story might have inspired all the \"insanity pleas\" that became popular afterward. If so, the film provided a negative service to this country. No one ever points out in the movie that - rage or not - you can't grab a gun and shoot somebody you're angry with and get away with it! Sometimes, that seems to be the message here.....that, somehow, that's okay. Well, as we know, it is permissible if your trial is in California.Ben Gazzara plays \"Frederick Manion,\" the accused and a very fortunate man. His flirtatious wife \"Laura\" (Lee Remick) claims she was raped. She isn't our normal idea of an innocent victim, and she's one that's hard to evoke sympathy from, but that's part of the dramatics. By the way, speaking of dramatics, Lana Turner was supposed to play that role but reportedly got into a big tiff with director Otto Preminger and left the project. (The two wound up slapping each other, reportedly.)Back to the story: \"Manion\" says he was in a \"trance\" when he killed the guy and I guess that's good enough to believe if you talking to a jury filled with morons or you have the wonderful and always witty Jimmy Stewart defending you.We also get the normal Hollywood exaggeration of the good-guy defense attorney doing all this work out of the goodness of his heart or for just a minimum fee. (I've never heard of one real-life lawyer like that. They want the money - all of it!) And we get longtime alcoholic who can suddenly stop his habit and help the defense attorney. You can nitpick this film to death with all the legal proceedings that would never be allowed, but are in here for dramatic reasons, but you can do that for almost any movie.One other reason this film gets rated so highly by Left Wing critics is that the man who played the judge in the film was Joseph Welch, who was the actual judge who asked Sen. Joseph McCarthy if \"he had no shame,\" making him instantly a hero to all Hollywood Liberals and film critics forever, all of whom hate McCarthy and his anti-Communism stance.Believability and bias aside, it's still an entertaining film, especially for one so talky, and is recommended for people who love courtroom dramas and don't care how long it goes on, and appreciate acting at its best.",

            "content": "Most court drama have an agenda going in - a bias to uncover and attack, a crime to solve, a mystery to unlock. They feel almost like a detective novel at times; information is doled out as required and at the end the audience is satisfied by how the script has forged a perfect and neat conclusion from the bits and pieces. Otto Preminger's Anatomy of a Murder does not follow this framework. It doesn't have a pre-planned narrative it wants to unfold, or an angle that wants to be highlighted. There are the usual courtroom flourishes, but they echo a sentiment from Preminger that these should not be dramatised or glamourised in any way, lest they mar the objectivity of the jury process. But of course, they do. Preminger's actors understand the roles that they play - how their roles are doubled in themselves, how they have to step up in the courtroom as lawyers putting on a performance. Stewart is brilliant; he slips so easily into that persona as if it was like putting on a hat himself, and making the weary hobby fisherman disappear. To win this case he doesn't need a justification, just an excuse, as he so snidely whispers to Manion at the beginning. And then he makes a big show out of it, pushing the rules of the courtroom to its peak theatricality: throwing his hands up into the air at injustice served, loudly slamming his palm into the opposition's table, using wisecracks at the right moments, and crucial, perfectly planned accusatory questions that are struck off from the record, but not from the jury's minds, or the screen. Preminger makes a clear note of these occurrences, because it happens many times and with great effect on the case.Lee Remick knows her role too, to be the fetching, coquettish object of desire that may or may not be the adulterous trigger that starts this chain of events. She doesn't seem like a rape victim, some have pointed out. She is of course deliberately flirtatious and touchy-feely because Preminger wants to throw her claims up into the air. Remick shows great range here, from the way she flashes a dazzling smile and flourishes her long golden locks (again, a performance intended to show off) when asked to remove her hat and shed the puritan image, to the way she breaks down into tears on the stand, and how her first appearance is sprawled out seductively on the couch at Biegler and asking her to address him as Laura. We see persuasive arguments for both sides of this women, and from both the defense and prosecution - we see all the facts, all the testimonies, all the research that Biegler goes through to prepare his position.And even at 2 hours 40 minutes it doesn't seem a touch dull at all. The scenes of the courthouse proceedings themselves could have been boring and dragging, but they are livened by a script that is quick on its toes and clearly communicates all the legal jargon, as well as imaginative staging. The triangles that Leavitt composes drip with dramatic intensity - always a figure lurking in the middle background gazing intently, eyes flicking from head to head, as the momentum swings back and forth. So delicately is this handled that even nearing the ending of the film with mere minutes to go, we have no idea what the jury's outcome will be. Preminger doesn't offer straight, simple answers, but offers the audience a seat in the jury itself, and shows us how these facts can be twisted in that fateful building.",

            "content": "I seem to have a somewhat different take on this movie than many. People are very hung up on the apparent moral ambiguity of the characters and ultimately, the movie. But I don't think that's the main point. This movie isn't really about whether or not the defendant is actually guilty or innocent.The movie is really *about* Jimmy Stewart's character, Pauly, the lawyer. The whole deal here is that he *used* to be the prosecutor, but got voted out, and has now become a defense lawyer who isn't trying very hard to be a defense lawyer. He has no clients or cases to speak of and doesn't really seem to care, spending most of his time fishing. His friend chides him for it, recognizing how hard it is for him to have been booted out like that, but that none-the-less he's got to get on with being a lawyer. A *defense* lawyer, not a prosecutor, with the key inherent difference: a prosecutor can afford to be moral, concerned only with guilt and innocence, whereas a defense lawyer has to provide the very best defense possible for his client, innocent or not. That's his job, and you can't make any bones about it. His friend has to remind Pauly about that after the first meeting with the defendant lieutenant.And so, the *real* issue is not, was the guy guilty or not; the real issue is: can Pauly really step up to the plate as a good defense attorney, and win a case where he *does* have to fudge, does have to use courtroom shenanigans, does have to overlook the moral ambiguity of his client and his wife. In short, does have to go all out to win the acquittal of a man who he probably has his own doubts about. To tell *this* story, of course the people and the facts of the case *do* have to be rather ambiguous. But the ambiguity isn't the point of the story. The role of a defense lawyer is. (and any one of you who ever for any reason needs to *hire* a defense lawyer will be very glad of that).So in the end, the importance of the jury's verdict is not on whether or not the Lt. goes free, but simply on whether or not Pauly won the case. Having won the case, he's shown himself that he can do it, and so he doesn't even care that much when he finds that his client in the end has skipped town and stiffed him. Because he's clearly ready to get down to really being a lawyer, rather than a fisherman with a legal shingle out front. Really, the guilt or innocence of the client is just this movie's MacGuffin. That doesn't mean that all these other issues aren't interesting and thought-provoking. They're simply not the point of the movie.",

            "content": "***Possible slight spoiler***This movie still ranks as my all-time favorite. Let me admit now - I am a lawyer, but I saw this movie long before I became one. I love it for several reasons. Yes, of course, it takes liberties with the law, but it also admits to many of the courtroom tactics/theatrics that are still in use today, and admitted to them at a time when people still liked to think of the law as a noble profession.The performances in this movie are incredible - Jimmy Stewart is the very picture of subtle humor and cynicism. Lee Remick and Ben Gazzara are perfect. But I'd like to point out two oft-overlooked performances that really shine. Arthur O'Connell's portrayal of Parnell develops beautifully over the course of the film as he comes to believe in himself again. My favorite character is Maida, played by Eve Arden. She's wry, she's funny, she mothers Paul and Parnell, and it's clear to everybody that not only couldn't they survive without her, but she's also the smartest one of them all.I could spend a great deal of time on territory others have covered - the soundtrack, the filmmaking, the courtroom scenes, the performances. But instead, I'll focus on my favorite thing. The story is my favorite. Not because it was groundbreaking or shocking - but because of its point of view. Everything you see and know in the movie is through the eyes of Paul Biegler. Through the entire courtroom battle, all the interviews with the Lt. and with Laura Manion, every strategy scene, straight through to the end, you only know what Biegler knows.  You never see the usual \"flashback\" scene to what \"really\" happened that night, and it would cheapen the film if you did. Biegler never knows if the outcome of the film is the \"right\" one, or if anyone told the truth at all. This same POV means that you never see any aspect of the events that lead to the trial - the murder, the alleged rape, etc. Nor does the viewer ever meet Barney Quill, thus never allowing the viewer to base an opinion of the events on Quill's \"character\" - just the same way as Paul  Biegler cannot.That POV aspect is the thing that makes this film my favorite of all time. It's why I've seen it dozens of times, spent a year tracking down the videotape (before they rereleased it) and have the poster hanging in my living room.  See it. Trust me.",

A former ADA, he took a job as a defender for a jealous army lieutenant (Ben Gazarra - now, he WAS a revelation and an extremely attractive man back in 1959) who pleads innocent in murdering the rapist of his very seductive young wife (Lee Remick). There is no doubt that he did the killing. The question is what strategy and tactics his lawyer will choose for his defense? The other joy of \"Anatomy of a Murder\" is George C. Scott in a role of ADA Claude Dancer. The gripping exchanges between Scott and Stewart literally keep the viewers on the edge of their seats. Both actors received well deserved Oscar nominations as well as Arthur O'Connell who played Stewart's drinking loyal friend, Parnell. The film is masterfully shot by Otto Preminger and features a brilliant music by Duke Ellington. \"Anatomy of a Murder\" is based on a seemingly simple story of a real life 1952 slaying at the Lumberjack Tavern in Big Bay, Michigan. It is packed with excitement, controversy, passion and intrigue where nothing and no one are what they seem.",

After watching for the first hour and a half, I was still wondering where this movie had been all my life. James Stewart gives a wonderful performance as a brilliant small-town lawyer, a cross between Perry Mason and Ben Matlock. The courtroom duels between Stewart and prosecutor George C. Scott are wonderful. A very young Lee Remick is excellent as the sex-starved tramp of a wife to Ben Gazzara - a precursor to today's Desperate Housewives perhaps? In addition, the film is directed by the legendary Otto Preminger, best known to those of my generation as Mr. Freeze on the old BATMAN show. So why isn't this film better known? The answer is simple - the ending is terrible. You keep waiting and waiting for all the loose ends, all the characters, all the drama to be wrapped up in one slam-bang finale, a la WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION. Sadly, none of this occurs. This film left me feeling empty and cheated. I guess it is never a waste of time to spend almost 3 hours watching Jimmy Stewart at his mid-career best, but this was a one-shot deal for me.

            "content": "I'm not crazy about this film. Despite the fact that it seems to get a good rating from everyone else, it doesn't work for me in a number of ways, numerous enough to begin counting.1) The Jazz. It's noisy, brash, and unpleasant. Reminds me of Orson Welles' movie with Vivian Leigh, and I wasn't crazy about the sound in that one either. And speaking of the music, it's so obvious that Jimmy Stewart is miming at the piano. He isn't even trying. Music is just the beginning of misses for this movie tho.2) It's never entirely clear what happened. I have to surmise that Lieutenant Manion struck his wife out of jealousy that she'd returned home having been with the bar owner and presumably Manion killed him as part of that same rage, but it's not clear to me that this is true. Therefore, it's not really clear to me what this movie is about. I prefer the ambiguity of the Big Sleep (which was already pretty ambiguous before a series of edits made it almost indiscernable). The diff is that in the Big Sleep, I felt like even if I didn't understand the exact turn of events, the characters were deeper and there was more to grab onto.3) Parnell's character is pedantic and tiresome, and only grows more so by the end, with his oration about juries;4) It's not clear to me how the prosecution failed to expose Manion's poor character to the jury. The prosecution barely asked him any questions save two. Manion should have been grilled. He should have been induced into a fit of anger, and the prosecution should have been able to clearly link it to his violent feelings for his wife. There relationship was a sham, and it's surprising to me that the prosecution couldn't reveal that.5) I don't understand the pivotal scene where Mary Pilant admits finding white panties. Exactly what would torn panties be doing in the laundry? I can think of two reasons: 1) her father put them therebecause he had done nothing wrong, or 2) someone else put them there as a frame. The prosecution did not pursue either idea carefully enough.6) Jimmy Stewart had a whole fridge full of fish. Was his intention to throw a buffet, because fish only keeps 2-3 days in a fridge.So these are just things off the top of my head, but there were more inconsistencies which bugged me. I'd say this film was not carefully planned. However, it does have Jimmy Stewart and George Scott in it. Murry Hamilton was also a strong point. There are some things going for this film, but it's too hastily conceived to be one of my favorites. Still, I watch it from time to time.",

Even the bar where much of the movie's action occurred is the same place where the original murder was committed in 1952.I am very thankful that director Otto Preminger refused to allow Lana Turner model her fancy gowns as Laura Manion and that he had the insight to choose a much more appealing newcomer, Lee Remick, instead. Gowns in a trailer camp? How would that have worked? With her usual stiffness and self-consciousness, Turner would have significantly weakened the action while Remick's natural sassiness and simmering sexuality enliven a script that might otherwise be dull and lifeless. Beyond her very pleasing physical appearance, Remick's smooth acting ability is established beyond a doubt here and her performance in this film launched her career, which peaked only a few years later in her Oscar nominated role as Kirsten Clay in \"The Days of Wine and Roses\" (1962). When Lee Remick died at the young age of 55, it was a very sad day for Hollywood and for all of us \"out here in the dark\" who truly loved her and still love her.In addition to Remick's zesty portrayal as Laura Manion, the supposed victim of the alleged rape that triggered the murder in the first place, we are treated to top notch performances by James Stewart as Paul Biegler, her husband's unappreciated defense attorney, Ben Gazzara as Lt. Frederic Manion, the accused husband, and George C. Scott as the visiting prosecutor from the state capital of Lansing. Add to that dynamic list an always entertaining, wise-cracking Eve Arden (\"Mildred Pierce, \"Our Miss Brooks\") as Biegler's loyal legal administrator and a lovely Kathryn Grant Crosby (\"The Phenix City Story\", \"Seven Voyages of Sinbad\", and several Bing Crosby Christmas TV specials) as a miscast but still very appealing Mary Pilant, who plays a critical role in the film's final outcome. Another noteworthy contribution comes from Arthur O'Connell (\"Picnic\", \"Man in the Grey Flannel Suit\") in his Oscar nominated role as an endearing Parnell McCarthy, Biegler's devoted, alcoholic sidekick.Regarding Laura Manion's much discussed panties, the seductive wife of the murder suspect struck me as a woman who often lost track of her panties, so you'll have to decide on your own whether Barney Quill actually raped her or whether she was rather a willing, consensual partner. While the Manions may appear to be a very engaging couple at first glance, approach them with an abundance of caution or you too risk being victimized by them. To no fault of his own, poor Muffy, Laura Manion's cute, little dog, is stuck with them, and I am very sad about that.Watch this one for the outstanding cast, the intriguing, authentic locale, the quirky, interesting characterizations, and that classic and very cool 1949 Pontiac Silver Streak convertible in which Stewart and O'Connell cruise through town. It takes a special breed to ride through the UP of Michigan with the top down at any time of the year. Bundle up, guys.",

Here, indeed, we see the process of justice being done, but would the author of that original statement be any happier as a result? At one level this movie is a straightforward good guy (defence attorney Biegler (Stewart)) versus bad guy (prosecutor Dancer (Scott)). But this simplicity masks a deeper question that Preminger poses - how is true justice obtained?As portrayed here justice is achieved through verbal pyrotechnics between articulate lawyers with a judge acting as umpire. Sadly, of course, this might well be nearer the truth than those who see justice as a finer concept might allow.We, of course, must side with the good guy and, aw shucks, it has to be Biegler. But even the most dedicated Jimmy Stewart fan will be uneasy with his army client, Lt Manion (coolly played by Gazarra), on a murder charge. Showing no emotion, except for one courtroom outburst, we can penetrate neither his mind nor his idea of the truth. We are never allowed to feel sympathy for him, nor indeed, for his sluttish wife (Remick) who alleges rape against the murder victim. Our reaction to the outcome is based solely on our affection for the good guy, rather than any feeling that justice has been done.In a sense the film is marred by the caricatures of the lawyers. Dancer is a hard-nosed, successful, big city lawyer (Scott well and truly deserved his Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor). His defence assistant, the local prosecutor, who hands the case over to him is a buffoon. On the other hand we have good old homespun Jimmy Stewart enjoying fishing expeditions, playing jazz piano, and happily bearing the financial implications of being ousted from the post of Prosecutor by the aforementioned buffoon. How much more challenging the film might have been if the prosecuting team had been less caricatured as bad guys.However, such reservations do not detract from a movie deserving of our utmost respect, especially with its sensitive, yet precise, handling of the details of the rape allegation. Mention of semen must have represented a major step forward in 1959, although clearly `orgasm' was a tad too far and we have to settle for `completion'. Neither is the film devoid of humour, despite its dark subject matter. The scene in which the judge and three lawyers discuss, with acute mutual embarrassment, the use of the word `panties' is a gem.Interesting that Preminger opted for black and white. Maybe he wants us to recognise that there is no such thing as black and white, especially when it comes to justice. Like the movies, it's just shades of grey.  All this and great music by (and a cameo from) Duke Ellington. Highly recommended.",

I was only mildly entertained by this film, mostly thanks to Jimmy Stewart and his as-per-usual impeccable acting, but when the ending came and there was no payoff, I found that what little entertainment present was not satisfying enough to make up for it.Good ol' Jimmy Stewart is Paul Biegler, a lawyer that was recently ousted from his position as district attorney by some younger blood. Biegler comes upon the case of Lt. Manion (Ben Gazzara), accused of murdering the man that raped his wife (Lee Remick), and Biegler, hesitant at first, decides to take it, defending Manion with an insanity plea. This insanity plea could have led to some good drama, indicting the justice system as containing too many loopholes for guilty men. Instead, the movie continues the story without focusing on this and misses the chance to make the point.Here at the beginning, the movie shows promise. The actors prove to be very good from the very start. Stewart, who was often unjustly accused of lacking versatility, is actually quite different from the George Bailey everyone knows; the difference in Stewart's characters is always subtle, but it's there nonetheless, and he received an Oscar nomination for his subtlety. Here he seems weathered and jaded, but still good-natured and sensible. Lee Remick begins the movie wonderfully as a carefree femme fatale who doesn't properly react to her husband's incarceration. The scenes between Remick and Stewart are the best in the movie as she flirts with him and seemingly looks to seduce him; however, the film doesn't follow through on this, as with so many other things. Halfway through the movie, the script seems to forget that Stewart and Remick had such good chemistry and removes from our sight any juicy scenes with the two of them.The trial part of the movie is entertaining enough, even though it falls into the clich\u00e9 of overly loud laughter from the court audience whenever the judge or attorney makes a joke, but it still left me longing for more. George C. Scott, who was nominated for an Academy Award inexplicably, adds barely anything to the movie. Scott is definitely a great actor (see Patton), but he's greatly underused here as the lawyer the district attorney brings in to help with the case. All he manages to get across is that his character is a snob.And then at the end of the trial, the ruling is given and that's that. Is it too much to expect something more from a movie? I understand there are movies that are made specifically for entertainment, but this is not one of them- there is nothing so entertaining here to rest an entire movie on it. I know it's adapted from a novel so I don't really know if the author of the book is to blame or the filmmakers, but it doesn't really matter who's to blame- the movie still isn't good.",

            "content": "Time has dulled the sensational aspects of a story daring to mention \"panties\" in a courtroom trial about a man accused of murder because a man attempted to rape his wife. LEE REMICK is the woman about whom we never really learn the truth, JAMES STEWART is defending the man on trial for murder, and GEORGE C. SCOTT is the relentless prosecuting attorney whose cat-and-mouse game with Stewart forms the heart of the film. Indeed it's the inside look at the strategies of a defense and prosecuting attorney that gives the film its real strength, because we are never quite sure about the outcome of the trial.ANATOMY OF A MURDER is directed in stark, cold, clinical fashion by Otto Preminger with a jazz score background punctuating the sleazier aspects of the story. Frankly, it's not a film I ever warmed up to--not then, and not now.It does have compensations in its excellent, crisp B&W photography and in watching pros like JAMES STEWART and GEORGE C. SCOTT hold the screen with dramatic courtroom confrontations, but the story seems slick and contrived, based as it is on a pulp novel by John D. Voelker that had built-in mass marketing appeal because of the sensational (by '50s standards) aspects of the unsavory story.It seems a dull thing today, not helped by a running time well over two hours.",

Stewart's benign presence no doubt helped audiences at the time to more easily navigate the rough waters of this film's language and mental images. I don't know that a major Hollywood film before this had addressed the subject of rape so candidly. It's no surprise that Otto Preminger, that most provocative of provocative directors, helmed this one.George C. Scott has a lot of fun with his role as the cocky, snarky prosecuting attorney. He brings a predatory, menacing edge to the film, an edge enhanced by stark black and white photography and a jazzy score.In the end, whether or not Stewart wins his case is beside the point; in this film, the ride is more important than the destination.Grade: A",

Even James Stewart as the defence lawyer, whom I normally like a lot, was strangely uninteresting and even physically ugly in this movie. The whole thing was somehow flat... I at least expected some big, surprising twist at the end - but there was nothing like that either.

            "content": "Anatomy of a Murder (1959)A classic, step by step, humorous but seriously acted crime and courtroom drama. But that's only a tenth of it. Otto Preminger was pushing forward in many ways with this innocuous looking movie. Take the jazz score, for starters, by Duke Ellington, which merges with the movie world in the scene where Ellington and a small combo (the real players) are in a roadhouse \"juke joint\" playing it up. Or watch a slightly aging Jimmy Stewart as a down on his luck lawyer confront a new America, a modern age where girdles are being replaced with panties, much to the scandal of this quaint little Midwest city.Or catch the rather brilliant, slightly too taut, pitch perfect performances by three side characters, all of which are exaggerated into believable caricatures for good reason: Lee Remick as the modern liberated woman, Ben Gazzara as the last of that kind of WWII soldier used so often in film noirs (he served in Korea), and Arthur O'Connell as a throwback even earlier, the man saddled with a drinking problem, the original drug of addiction. Throw in a sharp, acerbic George C. Scott as an opposing lawyer, and you see what you might be in for.This is a compactly molded story, the variables carefully limited, the details honed down to what matters, even the comic details like the fly fishing, added in little ways throughout the story. I went to school in this area, near where this fictional place would be, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and the honest folksiness is close enough to work (though the locals lack the accent, the yup instead of yes casual vocabulary). It's a great story, almost a stage play in its small ensemble interplay, but beautifully photographed, and expansive visually.It's also a great movie for what it was bucking against. All that talk about panties is making fun, behind the serious faces, of the Hays code, which was preventing reality from entering the movies of the 1950s. Of course, culture keeps going anyway, and the code fell apart, and Preminger played an important, brave role in helping that along. This movie was challenged for using words like \"sperm\" and \"rape\" and yet Preminger insisted, and the board gave it its seal of approval in the end. Even the general topic of rape and, uh, sex, was pushing the limits, for the late 1950s.Thankfully, it's still an artful film, not shock for shock's sake, and not racy by any means. But you can feel its edginess even so. There are hints of a sexist edge--the movie takes a male view of everything, even as it does make the public face the horrors of sex crimes--but overall Stewart is a model of respect, old school.",

The gorgeous Lee Remick doesn't seem to care much about being raped and beaten, and Ben Gazzara presents as a temperamental type who is not much bothered one way or another. We are left not even knowing the truth of the matter, and the victim's loving daughter seems quite prepared to hand over the most circumstantial evidence. 'Are you sure Quiller dropped these panties down the chute?' 'Yes' How on earth could she have known? Why would a rapist bring home some torn panties and then put them in the laundry? The film is full of these discrepancies. Some posters have praised Stewarts role, but its just his usual phoned-in part with a bit of cynicism thrown in.

            "review_title": "Stylish, Filled With Strong Characters; Realistic, Fascinating Courtoom Drama",
            "content": "This film is about sensational case tried in a rural courtroom. Robert Traver, real name John D. Voelker, had been a D.A. in an upper Michigan area populated by ethnic types such as Finns, Poles, etc. he wrote several popular books, \"Small Town D.A.\", \"Laughing Whitefish\", and this, his masterpiece. In this famous best seller he envisioned himself as Paul \"Polly\" Biegler, a man defeated for a political office and eager to try a sensational case. He is enjoying fishing with his old friend, but when an opportunity comes, he seizes it, after asking some penetrating questions. The case is peculiar because the man accused seems so calm, self-possessed; yet his defense has to be temporary insanity or impulsive loss-of-control. There is some evidence to suggest his wife is promiscuous, and that he, a man with a temper, might have been the one who damaged her before killing her sexual partner rather than the case being a rape. This is an old-style film, meaning highly-competent, movie narrative, complete with discoveries, insights, strong characters, interesting motivations and courtroom pyrotechnics. It is one of three Otto Preminger films that were shockers, by far the most successful. The difference here is the very fine cast. James Stewart was the attorney, Arthur O'Connell his skilled but alcoholic partner and Eve Arden his dynamic secretary. The opposition in the courtroom were Brooks West, Arden's husband in real life, and George C. Scott, in his first major role; the arrested man was Ben Gazzarra, his wife Lee Remick, the judge real-life jurist Joseph N. Welch. Also showing well in this powerful aggregation were Kathryn Grant, Orson Bean, Murray Hamilton, Howard McNear, Ken Lynch, Ross Brown, John Qualen, Irv Kucinet and Joseph Kearns. Technically, this B/W drama is first-rate all around, I suggest. With a script by Wendell Mayes that follows the novel closely, it boasted cinematography by Sam Leavitt and music borrowed from Duke Ellington who also appeared briefly; Boris Leven designed the stylish production; Howard Leven was the set dresser. The subject matter of the case was explicit for its time; so was the suggestion that Stewart took the case knowing his client was probably guilty and the incident perhaps not a rape at all. The language was unusual for its time; and the case's effect non the local area was magnified because the accused was a serving military officer. it has been suggested lee Remick is played against a pseudo-Christian standard, the one that was applied to Hollywood situations before the 1960s secretly; the rule was any woman that had or invited sexual relations outside of wedlock had to come to a bad end. Here the implication is that if Remick had not had sex with someone other than her husband, she wanted to do so. So the defense is as much of her rights to equal legal liberty with any male as about the truth of her assertion., at least in plot terms. The device of employing a \"big city\" type like Scott as Stanley Dancer brought in to oppose Biegler (Stewart) is an interesting one; we have spent time in the small town, so we resent his intrusion along with Stewart. the film is in no way dated; it is about a time when adults were a lot more intelligent, less cynical, and more confident their fellows' abilities to control themselves, male or female. The time of the film, 1959, made it a precedent-setting and very-often-copied sort of movie. it is long at 160 minutes but I suggest never flags and is never less than fascinating.",

            "content": "Otto Preminger's 'Anatomy of a Murder\" was released at a time where most trial movies followed melodramatic threads or tended to infantilize its adult audience. Even an indisputable masterpiece like \"12 Angry Men\" seems guilty of patronizing sentimentality unless we accept that Juror #8 is a manipulation expert. But what is difficult to swallow with Henry Fonda miraculously works with the ultimate likable actor James Stewart whose Paul Biegler constitutes his most complete and complex character he ever played.Paul Biegler is a fascinating character indeed because unlike his contemporaries, he doesn't try to earn our sympathy. He's a trickster and he knows it, toying with any helpful technicality, resorting to objectionable objections in order to leave the witness more time to come up with an answer or using calculated mistakes or wisecracks to sow doubt in the jurors' minds. Biegler turns the court into an arena where the defendant's sympathy depends on the lawyer's showmanship as much as his credibility.In this big circus under a fa\u00e7ade of protocoled respectability, we're as excited by Biegler as if we were watching a magician showing the tricks and then making an act. As far as the legal system goes, we see 'how it works' and 'how it works'. This is why the film is certainly the most accomplished movie from Preminger and one of the all-time best courtroom dramas: it's entertaining and insightful, thrilling and intelligent, linear and complex, but the best compliment I can give it is that it is new and fresh.The film uses familiar elements all right but it was the first to open the trash bin, literally. The film's last shot shows a high-heel open-toe pump and cans of beer in a trash-bin in the middle of a trailer park. This is not exactly the inspirational imagery legal movies seek, but it encapsulates the main idea of the film: victims aren't always innocent and we haven't much followed justice but a job being done. And that's about it. We learn a lot about the truth of justice but neither about the truth or justice, only the sharp intelligence of lawyers, prosecutors, judges and defendants.And this is one of the few films where every single player is memorable, besides Stewart, there's Joseph N. Welsh as the benevolent deadpan snarker judge and also a few newcomers who proved that a great story can do with fresh new faces. There's Ben Gazzara as hot-tempered and overly confident Lieutenant Manion, Lee Remick as his sexy trophy wife Laura, and naturally George C. Scott as Claude Dancer, the competent, rarely failed by his intuition, and moderately cynical attorney from New York, the Dragon as he's only an Assistant. But seriously, who's a bad guy anyway, you could make the same film from Dancer's perspective and it'd work.Cynical a bit? You bet. But this was a different kind of cynicism, one that sealed the crepuscular conformism of the 50s, and put the nails on the American Dream's coffin with the beatnik and jazz revolution. It had started in France with the \"400 Blows\" and \"Elevator to the Gallows\". In America, Cassavetes had pioneered independent cinema with his ground-breaking \"Shadows\", a small masterpiece that used jazz and characters with grey morality. \"Anatomy of a Murder\" is a studio picture that ignored Hollywood dogma as well, using Duke Ellington's soundtrack and the iconoclast simplicity of a minimalist poster, one of the most iconic of all time.Obviously, the film is an exercise in style but you've got to admire its guts and the way it addresses the hypocrisy of our times, calling a spade a spade and panties panties. Before \"Psycho\" would show a toilet bowl, this film literally flushed all the conventions and presented the ugliest realities of men and women's relationships. And what could be uglier than a case of sexual assault that ended with murder. The prosecution ignores the rape and makes it a case of jealousy while Biegler finds out with the help of his alcoholic colleague (Arthur O'Connell) precedents of temporary insanity, he's still got to prove that it was Manion's state at the time of murder.All the irony of the film is that while we follow Biegler trying to convince the jury that Laura was raped and Manion avenged her, their attitudes push our minds into opposite intuititions. Laura doesn't act shell-shocked when she meets Biegler and notices how tall he is. As for Manion, although he doesn't play his suave middle-age magnetism from Cassavetes movie, you can't watch Gazzara and believe this is a man that can be taken by any irresistible impulse. We can tell Biegler smells something fishy (isn't he an expert fisherman of the Michigan lakes) but he's a man of his job and that might be the only area of respectability in an overall delightfully subversive film.So, \"Anatomy of a Muder\" is certainly a pioneer in the way it made the trial play like a game with tactics and strategy, like the way Dancer brings an inmate to testimony against Manion so that Biegler can call Manion again and allow Dancer to cross examine him. Both Stewart and Dancer are delights to shows and at parts you can tell they're playing with their egos, the body language of Scott is so subtly perfect that the film would seriously benefit from several viewings. It's quite fitting that jazz is the overarching sound of a film which is moody, full of technicality and leaving enough room to improvisation.But I'm not a jazz expert (\u00e0 la Chazelle). However I know quite a lot about drinks and I can say \"Anatomy of a Murder\" shakes and stirs minds like Bond's martinis, with a straightforwardness served 'scotch neat'-style and a James Stewart who's aged like a good French wine. Moreover, the film accomplishes another miracle: it respects both the intelligence and the maturity of the viewer.",

And, this being one of his most well-known roles, it stands to reason that it would be a pretty good film in general. It certainly doesn't disappoint.The plot, based on true events, goes that a former district attorney (Stewart) gets pulled in to defend a man charged with first-degree murder. Alright, all in day's work, except that the man really did commit the killing, no way around that. But his wife also claims that the murder victim had raped her beforehand, offering mitigating circumstances. So our hapless DA protagonist faces a true uphill battle to get a no guilty verdict for his client.Anatomy of a Murder isn't all that different from all other courtroom dramas you might have seen. At least story-wise, that is. It's the all-star cast and the great script which elevate it above its peers. Stewart especially, but the film also includes names such as Arthur O'Connell, Ben Gazzara and George C. Scott, all powerful actors in their own right. The score featuring one and only Duke Ellington doesn't exactly hurt the film either.Not that the story doesn't have some good things going for it as well. It's pretty rare to see a film crime case where the accused defended by the protagonist is actually guilty. And also a pretty unlikable person as a whole. But the whole point of the film is that it shouldn't matter. If there is a case to be made within the law that he is not guilty due to the circumstances, then not guilty he should be. And that's something you don't see in every film.Anatomy of a Murder is one of my favourite courtroom dramas and a great film by any standard worth setting. Definitely worth your time.",

            "content": "(There are Spoilers) The 1958 best selling crime novel gets the star treatment in the Otto Preminger directed block buster \"Anatomy of a Murder\" that besides having James Stewart playing the lead role as ex-Iron City district attorney Paul Biegler the movie has that really wild and jazzy soundtrack that grabs you as soon as the opening credits start to roll down the screen by Duke Ellington and his band. Being retired from the courts since he was defeated as Iron City's D.A Paul Bieglar has been looking to get back practicing law and finally sees a case, and client, he'd like to represent. Paul represents US Army Let.Frederick Manion,Ben Gazzara, Manion murder case in the murder of local Thunder Bay Inn owner Barney Quill whom Lt. Manion shot five times. Talking to Lt. Manion's wife Laura, Lee Remick, Paul finds out that she was raped by Barney the night Lt.Manion shot and killed him which give him an opening for a temporary insanity defense for his client Lt. Manion.Paul by having his friend and old time country lawyer Parrnell McCarthy, Arthur O'Connell, help him out in doing the leg work on the case turned out to be the best thing he could have come up with in getting Let. Manion off. It looked at first that Paul was going to lose the murder case with all the evidence staked against Lt. Manion. Old man Parnell, against Paul's wishes, nursing a bottle of bourbon drives all the way up north across the USA Michian/Canadian border almost getting himself killed in a car crash to get some very important information that in the end will break the trial wide open and totally dismiss the very solid and almost air-tight case that the prosecution had against Let. Marion.Trying to get Let. Marion to cooperate was somewhat difficult for Paul with his very negative and defeatist attitude toward himself and the civilian courts, this guy was GI Joe all the way. Lt. Marion's hair-trigger temper didn't help him either in him almost strangling one of his fellow convicts Duke Miller (Don Ross), who would later be called by the prosecution to testify in it's behalf, for making snide remarks about his very sexy wife Laura. Lt. Manion wife's Laura was also anything but cooperative with Paul spending all her nights in bars being picked up, or picking up, men and getting drunk made her look anything but the innocent rape victim that she claimed to be that lead to her husband ending up behind bars for first-degree murder for killing her alleged rapist Barney Quill.By far the best parts of the movie \"Anatomy of a Murder\" are the ones in the courtroom with both Paul and Asst. D.A Claude Dancer, George C. Scott,skillfully sparring with each other over the facts and evidence in the case. With the case against Let. Manion hanging on the very slim facts, that Paul was desperately trying to prove, that he wasn't in full control of his mental faculties at the time of the shooting and also, what looked like prosecutor Dancer's ace in the hole where Dancer was scoring his biggest points, that Mrs. Manion wasn't all that forthcoming about her husbands violent temper and that it was Let. Manion, not the alleged rapist Barney Quill, who was responsible for the marks and bruises on her face and body. The trial finally came down to the lost panties that Lara Manion claimed that Quill ripped off her during his sexual assault.With the very aggressive and no holds bars, and take no prisoners, Dancer sees an opening when Paul brought in the waitress Mary Pilant, Kathryn Grant, of the late Barney Quill's Thunder Bay Inn as a surprise witness. Dancer smelling blood, mistaking just what her relationship to Barney Quill really was, quickly came in for the kill not realizing that he was falling right into a trap that Paul set for him. In a dramatic theatrical-like show of righteous indignation, against the beleaguered Mary Pilant, Dancer got the surprise of his life getting clobbered so hard between the eyes that he just slowly and embarrassingly slinked, like the snake in the grass that he is, away hoping that everyone in the courtroom, especially the jury, would forget what a complete fool he just made of himself.Also in the cast is the late Judge Joseph N. Welch as the presiding , what else, judge in the case Judge Weaver. Welch the real life hero of the 1954 Army/McCarthy Hearings really was enjoying himself playing more or less himself with some of the funniest and note-worthy, in regards to the law, lines in the entire movie.",

He does a good job of playing the country lawyer going up against a seemingly overpowering prosecutorial team. Remick is very believable in her role of the overly flirtatious wife of the accused. And George C. Scott is quite effective in his role of the Asst. State attorney general assisting the local, somewhat bumbling DA played by Brooks West.However, the overall plot of the film did not make for an exciting story. Much of the story line was completely predictable. And the ending completely stunk. One is left somewhat feeling like none of the loose ends are tied up or that the story isn't at a satisfactory conclusion. I wonder if they were forced to leave some on the editing room floor due to the length of the film. I would have preferred less courtroom bantering for a more satisfactory conclusion.I realize this was based on a true story, but I still think they could have adapted a better Hollywood ending to reward viewers for hanging through a LONG 2 1/2 hour movie.If I had to do over, I wouldn't have invested the time.",

When a newsworthy case is offered to him, his buddy Parnell McCarthy (Arthur O'Connell) urges him to take it, knowing he needs the income.Lt. Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara) is accused to killing the man who raped his wife. The lieutenant is a challenge for Paul to decipher---guarded, argumentative, sarcastic. Conversely, his wife Laura (Lee Remick) is unguarded, cooperative, and to the point. She is also beautiful, in an obvious, common way.When the two sides face off in the courtroom, Paul finds that the prosecution has added the talents of Claude Dancer (George C. Scott), a clever opponent from the big city of Lansing. What follows is one of the best courtroom dramas of all time. And that is just part of the appeal of this excellent film directed by Otto Preminger.Every actor gives a wonderful performance. The score is by Duke Ellington, which gives the film a cool, intelligent tone. The script is filled with moments of brilliance---from subtle comedy to intense confrontation. The presiding judge actually is a judge who possesses a magnetic screen presence.Special mention should go to Lee Remick and George C. Scott who command the screen no matter who they share it with. Arthur O'Connell is a favorite of mine, and he shows why in this film.\"Anatomy of a Murder\" was nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture.",

            "content": "Most movies make it clear throughout who's good and who's bad. \"Anatomy of a Murder\", on the other hand, keeps you guessing. Jimmy Stewart plays Paul Biegler, a lawyer hired to defend Lt. Fred Manion (Ben Gazzara), charged with murdering a man who allegedly raped his wife Laura (Lee Remick). Fred wants to cop an insanity plea and say that he committed the murder out of sympathy for his wife. But some things remain unclear throughout the trial. How much does anyone really know about any of these people? Is Fred really insane? And what role do Laura's missing panties play in the whole thing? The fact that they used the word \"panties\" is part of this movie's status as one of the many films that was pushing the barriers. The judge (Joseph Welch, the real-life judge who took helped expose Joe McCarthy) has to tell the courtroom that the evidence in question is \"...Mrs. Manion's panties.\" After everyone giggles, he reminds them that he wanted to get that point out of the way and that there will be no more giggling.Director Otto Preminger, who dealt with a real-life trial in 1955's \"The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell\", puts an interesting spin on this fictional trial. The black-and-white cinematography helps to give the feeling of both sides in the trial. You literally can't tell which side is the \"right\" side for most of the movie. \"Anatomy of a Murder\" is truly sublime.",

One of my favorite character actors, Murray Hamilton, plays a key part (Al Pacquette) to perfection.

            "content": "(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon.)Otto Preminger, who produced and directed this fine courtroom drama starring James Stewart, Lee Remick, George C. Scott and Ben Gazzara, had a knack for translating best-selling mid-cult novels to the screen (The Man with the Golden Arm (1955); Exodus (1960); Advise and Consent (1962) and others) usually in a nervy manner, sometimes heavy-handed, sometimes pretentious, but always worth a look. Part of his secret was star power. Like Hitchcock, he liked to go with big names supported by fine character actors.And part of his secret was his long experience in both the theater and films going back to the silent film era. He knew how to put together a movie. But more than anything it was his near-dictatorial control over the production (something directors seldom have today, and never in big budget films--Preminger's were big budget for his day) that allowed him to successfully capture the movie-going audience at midcentury.This and Laura (1944) are two of his films that go beyond the merely commercial and achieve something that can be called art. Seeing this for the first time forty-three years after it was released I was struck by the fine acting all around and the sturdy, well-constructed direction. James Stewart's performance as the Michigan north country lawyer Paul Biegler might shine even more luminously than it does except for a certain performance by Gregory Peck three years later as a southern country lawyer in the unforgettable To Kill a Mockingbird (1962). Lee Remick, in a frank, but imperfect imitation of Marilyn Monroe, co-stars as Laura Manion, the wife of army Lt. Frederick Manion (Gazzara) whom Bielger is defending on a murder charge. The defense is temporary insanity because the man he shot raped his wife. Bielger slyly gains sympathy for his client by deliberately allowing it to come out that Laura is sexy and flirtatious enough to drive any man crazy. Indeed, he tricks the prosecution into doing his work for him. George C. Scott plays Claude Dancer, a big city prosecutor, with snake-like precision while Gazzara manages to combine introspection and cockiness as the young lieutenant. Fine support comes from Eve Arden (best known as Our Miss Brooks on TV and in the movie of that name) as Biegler's loyal secretary and Arthur O'Connell as his alcoholic mentor. Kathryn Grant, who gave up a promising film career to marry Bing Crosby and have children, has a modest role as the murdered man's daughter.I've seen many courtroom dramas, some real, some fictional, since this film first appeared, but I have to say it stands up well. The action (for the most part) feels realistic and the tension is nicely created and maintained.The resolution is satisfying and the ending is as sly and subtle as any country lawyer might want. Incidentally, if this movie had more total votes cast at IMDb, it would rank in the top one hundred of all time, which is where it belongs.See this for James Stewart whose easy, adroit style under Preminger's direction found full range. Although he gave many fine performances, I don't think Stewart was ever better than he was here.",

A hotshot prosecutor however has other ideas ...Along with Inherit The Wind, this is the archetypal courtroom drama, full of wonderful badinage, great performances and nail-biting tension. Brilliantly scripted by Wendell Mayes, it was quite daring for its day (much is made of the significance of Remick's underwear) and plays a beautifully balanced line between witty point-scoring and a sobering adherence to judicial prosecution. What makes it so good is the excellent cast, with virtually every performance near flawless. The triumvirate of Stewart (as a traditional gone-fishing small-town good guy), Scott (as a peerless, hard-edged character assassin) and the wonderful Welch (as a replacement judge who specialises in spitting barbed comments at pontificating lawyers) are a joy to watch, but Remick (as a trailer-trash hottie), Hamilton and Arden are all terrific as well. The movie features a great big-band jazz score by the legendary Duke Ellington, who also has a cameo role dueting on the piano with Stewart. A great courtroom movie, with a finely-judged perspective on the legal process - when Stewart asks if a dog can be admitted as a defence witness, the long-suffering Welch sighs heavily but then agrees, because at least, unlike the lawyers, it's incapable of speech.",

The courtroom scenes were probably groundbreaking in 1959 but seem more than a bit ridiculous now. The duels between Stewart and prosecutor George C. Scott are often times forced and silly. Lee Remick gives a decent but slightly amateurish performance as the gorgeous and flirtatious wife of the accused husband Ben Gazzara. The film is directed by the legendary Otto Preminger and he did a good job of mingling the court room scenes into the rest of the story. However, the explanations of what \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" means, are so childish and illogical by modern legal interpretations, that the whole plot and story falls apart. In 1959 these elementary school level explanations about legal matters might have seemed adequate, but by modern standards it is just plain laughable. The ending comes a bit suddenly and this is definitely another weakness to throw onto the list. Really, this movie wastes some fine performances from the cast.

            "content": "Clearly, Preminger intended this film to be morally ambiguous; the less than sympathetic accused, his slatternly wife etc.  As other reviewers observed, the film's treatment of sensitive issues/taboos were quite groundbreaking, perhaps not so apparent in this modern day & age when such issues are so commonplace.The film is almost procedural in its courtroom scenes, hence the film's length which perhaps hinders its overall dramatic intensity.  The drama revolves less around a simplistic portrayal of good & evil, but is about the cynical uses/abuses of the legal system.  I liked the manner in which the lawyers, both Beigler (Stewart) and Dancer (George C Scott) raise questions that are dubious, are warned by the Judge and apologise profusely for their indiscretions, only to reveal that this is a key technique used to plant doubt into the jurors' minds.  However, I found too many anomalies in the film. Laura Manion (Lee Remick) plays a woman who has allegedly been raped yet a few days later, her character is flirting with every man around.  The plot slips into the proceedings \u0091doubts' such as the location of the rape, a known \u0091lovers-lane'.  Yet I found Remick's depiction of a rape victim slightly disturbing.  It is clear that rape victims suffer from shock and mental trauma, often withdrawing into themselves.  Watching Remick, one is reminded of Jodie Foster's much more emotionally charged portrayal as a victim of a sex assault in \u0091the Accused'.   However, the lack of flashbacks in this film work to its advantage and maintain its air of ambiguity.My second main criticism is that Beigler is never really certain about his client's innocence and whether anyone told the truth at all.  The end is ironic after Manion (Ben Gazzara) exits suddenly, by saying that he had \u0091an irresistible urge to leave', a witty play on the Army psychiatrist's explanation for his crime.  In the film, James Stewart's character never really confronts the moral doubts that he maybe defending a man who is less than innocent.    Perhaps we are expected to view Stewart's lawyer as a professional, like a doctor, both of whom treat cases with professional detachment.  The film's performances are outstanding including the supporting roles.  I expect Stewart's role as a jazz-loving, idiosyncratic lawyer must have shocked his fans with his home-spun image suddenly confronted with the issue of rape  and explicit post-mortems.  I particularly liked George C. Scott, a complete contrast to Stewart's home-spun folksiness.  Intense & belligerent, the courtroom scenes really do come alive when he cross-examines the witnesses.  His expression of sudden disbelief after a key revelation \u0096 one that literally ends his case \u0096 is great to behold.",

Scott) the viewer must decide whether the evidence provided is sufficient to a charge of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and/or is the defendant innocent as explained by his councilor Paul Biegler? You decide.Lee Remick plays Laura Manion the liquor loving, pinball playing sexpot promiscuous battered wife to her jealous retired military husband Lt. Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara). Gazzara plays himself once again portraying a pouty low keyed husband with a known jealous temper who admits to shooting the presumed rapist who sexually assaulted his hot looking and promiscuous wife Laura Manion.Laura likes to socialize with other men, wear tight fitting clothes, go out drinking, and she specifies to her lawyer Paul Biegler that she doesn't wear a girdle because she doesn't need one. This statement will come into play several times throughout the courtroom proceedings. For 1959, the sexual complexity of this courtroom drama must have been groundbreaking and I can only imagine what the director had to leave on the cutting room floor to appease the film censors for this period in film making.It is extremely well acted and the supporting actor performance by actor Arthur O'Connell who plays a \"past his prime\" boozehound named Parnell Emmett McCarthy has his own \"come to Jesus moment\" when he makes a conscious decision to help investigate and corroborate the defenses testimony that it is not all that it is perceived to be.The film is in black and white which adds to the realism and our ability to focus on the characters and nothing else.

Of course; that was 1959 and \"we\", being the 'Editorial We', were a most definite pre-adolescent 13 years old and understood little. No matter how \"grown-up\" and sophisticated we may have thought of ourselves, we were scarcely little more than children then.STARTINGLY true, yet some way so very amusing is the glaringly inept misconceptions that were so rapidly cultivated in our little heads. Having read somebody's movie review of it in THE CHICAGO American that the story revolved around a most delicate subject, namely R-A-P-E; many of us (the \"Editorial Us\") and our peers mistakenly jumped to the conclusion that 'ANATOMY' in the title referred to the female form.WELL, that was then.THIS is now and we've just viewed the film, beginning to end and uninterrupted. We now know just a tad more about life than we did during those days of nearly half a century ago. This period has been time well spent in rendering our understanding to fully spread and mature. We hope that this will also apply to the rest of our intellectual and emotional makeup.SO it has come to pass that today's special guest of honor, Otto Preminger 's ANATONOMY OF A MURDER (Carlyle Productions/Columbia Pictures, 1959) we are presented with a fine drama that makes high grades in all areas on its report card and more than passes in all areas. In the film, we have a rare combination of realism and artistic license; dramatically driven sequences counter-balanced with characterizations that could come right out of life.PERHAPS Mr. Preminger's approach was predicated by his own life experience with not American Jurisprudence; but with the behaviour of people caught up in a crime anywhere. People are people and react in some universally similar manner; their particular cultures notwithstanding.MR. PREMINGER'S father had been the Attorney-General to Emperor Franz Josef von Hapsburg in his role of dual Monarch of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Whereas we don't know if the Elder Preminger had young Otto (Ain't he cute?) study law in preparation of following in Herr Preminger's foot-shtops or not; however it is reasonable that the young Master Preminger was indeed familiar with the rudimentary practical application of law, at least as a family's livelihood.OUTSTANDING is the cast that the director has to work with, he manages to get the very best from all involved. Stem to stern, each and every performer gives the best that they have in them; culminating with what can only be described with one superlative after another; all being fit to be elevated to the best examples of type casting available. As top quality each characterization is, there is an amazingly uniform sort of calm and balance maintained throughout its nearly 2 \u00bd hours on the screen.MR. JAMES STEWART heads up a fine cast, yet fails to \"Star\" in his lead; for in the best Shakespearian Tradition. \"The Play is the Most Important Thing.\" All others featured make the most of their screen time and manage to contribute their maximum to the final product. This none too shabby a cast includes: eyeful Lee Remick (Woo,woo,woo,woo!), a young Ben Gazarra, Eve Arden (\"Miss Brooks\" herself in a sort of Della Street-esquire portrayal), Murray Hamilton, brilliant George C. Scott (pre THE HUSTLER & PATTON), Arthur O'Connell ('Grandfather' from Central Casting), jack of all trades Orson Bean, Ken Lynch (eternally the Cop); as well as veterans such as Jimmy Conlin, John Qualen and Joseph Kearns.THE whole story is done in a ground-breaking manner; having the discussion of Rape as an on screen topic. The production team manages to pave the way for more serious topics to follow. For example, prior to this Film, the word \"Sperm\" wouldn't be used unless it had \"Whale\" following it in a sentence; as in: \"Avast! Tis the Great Sperm Whale, Moby Dick!\" WE are furthermore treated to the Original Score composed by none other than Duke Ellington; who makes an uncredited and all too brief an appearance as a Cabaret Key Board, Honky-Tonk type piano player-singer, The theme and the incidental music are the ultimate ingredient in knotting the whole masterpiece together.OUR (\"my\") own experience as a Chicago Cop for 35 years stands as a testimony to another aspect of this Otto Preminger.all time masterpiece; that being a work of fiction which is truly grounded in a reality. Without this anchoring in a world that at least could be, the story and film, could well be relegated to the status of \"B\" Movie Pot Boiler.NOTE: This is the first time in a month of Sundays that Schultz and myself didn't have a Footnote for your edification and enjoyment.POODLE SCHNITZ!!",

And who would want to replace Lee Remick as Laura Manion? She is so amazingly sexy in this. I never tire of seeing her on the screen at any stage of her career. Like most of the stars of this film though, she died years ago; too young at 55.It's fascinating the way Polly resists the charms of Laura when she fully expects to ensnare him like she does just about all men. We sense that Polly knows where his happiness lies. He is content with his insular existence; his close circle of friends; his passion for fishing and the study of the law with his old friend Parnell McCarthy (Arthur O'Connell) \u2013 battles in the courtroom are one thing, but he doesn't encourage the kind of disruption to his life that someone like Laura Manion would bring.Lee Remick, Ben Gazzara, George C. Scott and Kathryn Grant were all newcomers; what a cast, and the interesting thing is that this would remain one of the best movies of their careers.Director, Otto Preminger liked to push the envelope. Even now, the rape case at the core of the film and terminology used in the court still sounds a little shocking \u2013 amazing for a film made in 1959.Preminger also had a reputation as one of the meanest, most fractious filmmakers in Hollywood. However according to a recent biography, \"Otto Preminger: The Man Who Would Be King\" by Foster Hirsch, the participants of the film claimed that he created almost a family atmosphere on location in Michigan and it was one the happiest shoots they were ever involved in.Otto made a number of very good movies in his career and some pretty ordinary ones. But \"Anatomy of a Murder\" is a masterpiece, and surely no artist can line the ducks up perfectly every time although Otto's batting average was better than most.",

Instead the film picks up a few days after the event it self and is just a trial movie from start to finish. This still could have been the makings of a good movie. Stewart defending an innocent man with huge amounts of evidence stacked against him would have been a good way to go, even if not a very original trial movie. Instead they have a some sleazy Jerk named Manion, who lives in a mobile home and is unkind and unappreciative of his gorgeous wife. Manion shot a bar owner with a dozen witnesses, because the guy had raped his wife. This  was obviously not a good thing of the bar owner to do, but Manion kills the bar owner hours after the event because he says, \"I have the unwritten law on my side.\" So he thought he could do it in cold blood and get off scot free. So Jimmy tells Manion he can only get of if he actually committed the murder while insane. So Manion fabricates a lie that he went temporarily insane. Manion goes to see an army psychiatrist to add some weight his lie. He lies to the psychiatrist and the psychiatrist says Manion had an \"unavoidable urge\" to kill the man.  The rest of this overly long movie is the trial. In which Jimmy calls up a bunch of witnesses in order make the jury somehow thing that this dirt bag deserves to not be punished for his crime.  Then at the end of the movie (160 of the longest and most boring minutes of my life later) Manion is declared \"Not Guilty\" by a jury that has been lied to immensely. Then Masion Repays Jimmy Stewart by.............Driving off in his Mobile home with his wife with out paying Stewart a dime. He leaves' Stewart a note: \"I had an \u0091unavoidable urge' to leave.\" Masion may have Committed a felony by lying under oath during his trail, but at least he can joke about it.  Besides, what is the reason they made this film? To teach us that you can abuse the legal system in order to not be punished for your crimes? All and all the movie is pretty slow and boring and pointless. if you like Jimmy Stewart and want to see him in a movie were a your actually get to SEE a murder, instead of just hearing about it for two hours and 40 minutes, see the brilliant Hitchcock film \u0091Rope'.",

I have to be once again the turd in the punchbowl of encomia here and side with the minority who ask where the emperor's clothes are. I was drawn to the movie by the wonderful cast; the great Jimmy Stewart, Lee Remick, Ben Gazzara Eve Arden, of whom we don't see enough, and the great character actors Arthur O'Cpnnell and Murray Hamilton. It's a long movie and I spread it out over 2 nights. The first night I found myself reveling the proceedings, all in glorious, nostalgic black and white. The second evening I found myself starting to look at my watch and by the end terminal boredom was setting in. The movie is just plain too damn long. And it would have been worth it if there were any surprise revelations or plot twists, but there aren't. Verdict announced, end of story. We find ourselves asking to what end did we sit through almost three hours of courtroom dialogue. An interesting premise is that raised by one viewer, who advanced the idea that this is Preminger's critique of the American justice system. Maybe so, but even if that were the case, he could have done it more succinctly.",

            "content": "Otto Preminger had a knack for sniffing out provocative projects then shoving them into the public's puss before it was quite ready for them.  The Moon Is Blue raised a ruckus in 1953 for using the word \"virgin.\"  Six years later, Anatomy of a Murder sprayed the audience with clinical forensic testimony about a sexual assault, though, oddly, the word deemed most offensive seems to have been \"panties.\"GI Ben Gazarra shot and killed a bar owner who, he claims, raped his handful of a wife, Lee Remick.  Easy-going country lawyer Jimmy Stewart defends him; the prosecuting attorney is the young George C. Scott (and clearly the actor to watch).  Preminger holds our attention all the way through a very long movie by keeping us in the dark about what really happened.  Was the sex consensual between the slain victim and Remick, the talk of a small town for her tight sweaters and nocturnal excursions to bars?  Were her black eye and other bruises the result of the attack or the work of her jealous, abusive husband?  With perverse brilliance, Preminger ends the movie with these questions unanswered.Though remembered as a courtroom epic, the best hour of Anatomy of a Murder is probably its first, before the legal fireworks  -- as the best part of the following year's equally notorious Psycho took place before Janet Leigh's car pulled into the Bates Motel.  Here, Preminger shot the movie on Michigan's Upper Peninsula, a chilly spit of land moored between the northern border of the U.S. and Canada.  It's a rustic backwater peopled by hardy loners who hang out in log-cabin roadhouses hung with fluorescent fixtures, an isolated society where hunting and fishing constitute the chief amenties.  The government buildings have the stolid, glum look of fortresses against backwoods anarchy.The roles are cannily cast.  Eve Arden offers tart refreshment as bachelor Stewart's girl Friday; playing the presiding circuit-court judge is Joseph Welch, whose footnote in history was his eloquent rebuke to Joe McCarthy during the Army-McCarthy hearings, a rebuke widely thought to signal the beginning of the end for the red-scare tyrant.  Some plot strands aren't worked through to the end: an automobile accident by alcoholic defense attorney Arthur O'Connell leads nowhere, and Kathryn Grant as the murder victim's illegitimate daughter ends up a red herring.Preminger's showman's instincts may have been keener than even he realized. By retaining the element of doubt as to the facts of the case, he has managed to keep the story fresh even while attitudes towards the issues it explores have shifted.  Had he chosen a more judgemental ending -- had he opted for a ringing, Hollywood resolution -- the movie would now look dated, out of touch.  But Anatomy of a Murder, surprisingly, has aged very well indeed.",

Stewart steers the boat well, guiding his troupe of cinema newcomers (who later gain distinction in their own right) that includes Gazzara, Remick, George C.Scott as the special adviser brought in to beef up the prosecution, while veterans Arthur O'Connell, Eve Arden and Murray Hamilton offer reliable support.Preminger's picture takes a very clinical view of proceedings, and in particular, the letter of the law which is often painstakingly explained in layman by the characters, so much so, that pacing is sometimes a distinct challenge. It's a fine line between precision and tedium, and while Preminger's examination flirts with the latter, fortunately, the characterisations and sub-plots as Stewart and O'Connell build the defence, creates a focused and compelling narrative of considerable quality that manages to defy the near three-hour runtime.",

Ben Gazzara is excellent as the army official on trial for the murder and Lee Remick certainly showed her capability as the so called victim in this film.Stewart acts like an attorney as he garnered his 5th and final Oscar nomination. Supporting nominations went to Arthur O'Connell as his alcoholic associate and George C. Scott, who is just great as a District Attorney. Watching Scott and Stewart go at it in court is just terrific. Kudos to Joseph Welch, a real life judge, for playing the judge. There were times when the judge spoke that I thought I was hearing the voice of Percy Kilbride.

            "content": "The film is about a lawyer Paul Biegler (James Stewart) who takes the case of a Lieutenant in the Army Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara) who shot and killed a bartender by the name of Barney Quill who his wife (Lee Remick) said raped her. It seems like a no win case because there is a witness to the murder and the Lieutenant only has his wife's word that she was raped. Stewart must show that the Lieutenant was temporary insane, a task that is not made easy by the overzealous of the prosecution team.What Otto Preminger does with this film is give no affirmative answer at the end of it, it is left up to the audience to decide what is the truth and he doesn't tell the audience one side is lier's and the other isn't, there is evidence that supports both the rape happening and the Lieutenant being temporary insane when he killed Quill and evidence that contradicts the story the Lieutenant and his wife has given the court.The supported evidence is the bruises the wife had after the attack. Tourists heard the screams. The police believed the wife. The police saw car tracks and dog tracks where the wife said the attack happened. Also, they find where her glass case fell, near to the rape. She took a lie detector test. Her ripped panties are found in the laundry, right next to Quill's room. The doctor can't be certain, one way or the other that she was raped. At that time 1959, it was hard to determine this especially with a mature married woman. The Army doctor said Manion was temporary insane. The dead man was a very good marksman and had guns behind the bar.The evidence that doesn't support the wife and Manion is there were no witnesses to the rape. The wife's conduct before and after the rape, she is very flirty. She wore tight clothes and seemed to touch the dead man in some sexual way. When she is telling Stewart her story, there is no emotion, she is not upset talking about it. There are the hidden looks between the husband and wife that seem to say there is more to the story then they are telling. The wife is obviously scared of her husband and she has been hit by her husband before. She swore on a crucifix so her husband would believe her and that seems to say that he didn't believe her before she swore on it. The prosecution doctor says Manion wasn't temporary insane and the eye witness backs this up by saying he was calm and cool when he killed Quill and even threatened him. Manion is clearly jealous of men who show his wife any attention.In the end, Manion is found Not guilty but there is no overall thing that says what truly happened and it makes a refreshing difference that the audience watching the film has to think what might have been the true events.I don't agree this was James Stewart's last best film, he carried on his stealer performances in other films and TV roles after this film. Lee Remick is brilliant as Laura Manion who has two sides to her personality, she likes men and can come across as a tigress and then she has a vulnerable side who is lonely at times. George C. Scott has a small role as a state Attorney who is trying to help the prosecuting attorney convict the Lieutenant.The music fits so well with the film, music by Duke Ellington who plays a cameo in the film as Pie eye.The film keeps the audience guessing and makes you pay attention throughout to get you to think and decide what you believe. I can understand why the film was considered racy at the time because it mentions sperm, contraceptive, climax, penetration, bitch and slut and it shows the ripped panties but it is pretty tame compared to the films that have followed such as The Accused but I say well done to all the people who worked on it as they didn't try to shy away from any aspect of the rape and that must have been a hard thing to do with the society being what is was when the film was being made.",

Although the slick and mephistophelean prosecuting attorney is given the coup de grace by the dramatic device of the surprise witness, the verdict really hinges upon a legal precedent from 1886.Let us not forget that Preminger was the son of a noted Viennese jurist and despite the Law and Justice being distant cousins they are, in this film at least, on speaking terms.",

            "content": "Despite the pretty good acting and excellent cinematography, there were many things I didn't like about this picture-it's just one of those films that one can't help but feel is quite overrated. The film is entitled \"Anatomy of a Murder,\" but should have been called \"Anatomy of a lugubrious murder trial.\" When you hear the word \"murder,\" you're expecting a story that's exciting and interesting. Not so here. It's all about a murder where all the basic facts are known from the outset-there are no real twists and turns. The worst thing you can say about the story is that it lacks suspense!Jimmy Stewart plays attorney Paul Biegler in a small town in the upper peninsula of Michigan. He's a bachelor, a former district attorney, who enjoys fishing and playing the piano. He has an older attorney buddy Parnell McCarthy (Arthur O'Connell) who happens to be an alcoholic as well as a secretary, Maida Rutledge (Eve Arden).What's really unconvincing is that when Paul agrees to take on the big murder case, his client admits that he's broke and can't pay him. What attorney in his right mind would take a murder case for no money? Wouldn't happen. Especially when it's made clear that Paul is unable to pay Maida her salary.It takes quite awhile before Act II begins and certainly Act I could have been tightened up considerably. Things begin in earnest when the seductive Mrs. Laura Manion (Lee Remick) contacts Paul and asks him to defend her husband, US Army lieutenant Manny (Ben Gazzara), who has just been arrested for murdering a bar owner, Barney Quill, after learning that Quill raped his wife.The trial is presided over by the folksy Judge Weaver (played by the real-life lawyer Joseph Welch, most famous for facing down Senator Joe McCarthy during the Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954). Welch manages to bring some comic relief to the proceedings. Also in the mix is DA Mitch Lodwick (Brooks West), joined by a prosecutor from the State Attorney's office, Claude Dancer (George C. Scott).The prosecution's strategy is basically to impugn the character of Mrs. Manion who they portray as a woman of low moral character who seduced the murder victim. The prosecution unsuccessfully tries to prevent any mention of a motive as to why Manny killed Quill. Eventually however, Paul manages to introduce the motive of rape as part of the legal proceedings.Paul pursues an insanity defense in which he attempts to use the concept of \"irresistible impulse\" (a precedent that hadn't been used in Michigan law since 1886), to get his client off. The whole idea of \"irresistible impulse\" appears to be a rather flimsy legal stratagem as there are plenty of cases where a murder has been committed after the killer acts impulsively. That's why the charge of manslaughter exists as part of legal jurisprudence to explain mitigating circumstances when a murderer commits his act under emotional duress.But here the DA doesn't bring the lesser charge and must rely on impugning the character of the defense's main witness (Mrs. Manion). It all backfires when the bar manager, Mary Pliant (Kathryn Grant) finally fesses up that she found Mrs. Manion's panties in a laundry hamper after it appears that the murder victim threw them down a laundry chute. Dancer attempts to imply that Mary made the whole story up out of jealousy, but Paul (after learning from Parnell who travels to Canada to unearth newly discovered information) that Mary was Quill's daughter and was telling the truth.So because of Mary's testimony, it becomes clear that Mrs. Manion's story was basically true. Without the lesser charge of manslaughter and the jury's natural predilection to blame the victim in this case, Paul manages to get Manny off by reason of insanity (in the real life case the film was based on, the defendant is found sane by a psychiatrist two days later and is let free).Where is the suspense here? A man whom we already know is guilty manages to get off through a defense attorney's base appeal to the jury's thirst for revenge (the murder victim is also a rapist!). I suppose the use of such unsavory tactics on the part of the defense to free an obviously guilty client is part and parcel of a defense attorney's job. But it still leaves a bad taste in one's mouth.The same goes for the Manions who prove to be highly unlikable characters. Especially when Manny skips out on Paul at the end, fails to pay him and claims it was an \"irresistible impulse\" that made him not only take off but leave his wife as well. The Prosecution team hardly accrue any accolades either as they are bent on maligning the character of Mrs. Manion.Lee Remick is a standout here as the \"party girl,\" seeking the affection of men to prop up an always insecure ego. The rest of the cast is pretty realistic and George C. Scott proves to be a good foil to Jimmy Stewart.In addition to the lack of suspense, the characters hardly merit any sympathy. That includes the defense attorney who employs a highly dubious psychiatric defense, a prosecution team hell bent on distracting the jury by maligning the chief witness and the defendant himself who proves to be a base manipulator of the first order.",

            "content": "Anatomy of a Murder (1959) is described by critic Nick Pinkerton as \"maybe more universally loved by law students than by cineastes.\" It is also enjoyed by people who are both film aficionados and former- law students. The film dramatizes the trial of an army lieutenant who shot and killed a resort owner after he raped his wife. We see none of this violence, so the action is in the dialogue and the emotions. Here, the film is a success- the acting and dialogue is smooth and believable, heavy but eased with occasional wisecracks. I watched Witness for the Prosecution (1957) at about the same time and thought the ending lacked these qualities; I was quite satisfied with Anatomy of a Murder.Not showing us any of the violence, the film allows the viewer to piece together what happened along with James Stewart's character. We meet the lieutenant, described by Stewart as hostile and insolent, not very likable. We meet his wife, a \"free and easy\" type, attractive and friendly. The film teases us with possibilities- the prosecution suggests sex between the woman and victim was consensual, that her injuries were inflicted by her husband. But we know she passed a lie detector test and other evidence supports her story. Generally, the film makes us question whether the lieutenant really was under irresistible impulse- we get the feeling he wasn't, and it's debatable as to how much Stewart's character believed this himself, as he was coaching him on defence strategies in an early scene. As we piece together the mystery, the attention to detail is commendable- the lawyers press for details, addressing inconsistencies, as we see when Stewart wants to know if the dog was in or out of the truck during the sexual assault. This is, as the title suggests, where the anatomizing factors in.Some of that detail gets rather personal- when George C. Scott's prosecutor grills the lieutenant's wife on whether she always wears underwear, and relentlessly demands another female witness to say the victim was her lover. From one perspective he's doing his job, from another he is prosecuting women in general; with extensive testimony on how the wife was dressed and behaved, we see the old stereotypes and the old attitude that it was either consensual or that she was asking for it. Interestingly, Anatomy of a Murder dramatizes not only a murder trial but an old-fashioned rape trial, a sort of two-for-one affair. In doing so, it uses blunt and courageous language defying censorship- sexual details, use of words like \"slut\" and \"bitch.\" The result is a powerful film, a trailblazer of sorts that retains its impact.",

Shot in 1959 in northern Michigan, the on-location shooting has, over time taken on a period look that further enhances the movie and the story also has the realism of mid-20th century America. Jazz music with a cameo by Duke Ellington is a cool touch from the era. Leading man James Stewart as lawyer Paul Biegler, returns from a fishing trip to his home-based office where he gets by on divorce cases and whatever else comes along to pay his bills. His friend and confidante Parnell McCarthy tells him about an upcoming case that McCarthy feels he should take up. The case involves characters in conflicts involving love, romance, jealousy, and revenge. The courtroom drama was particularly well performed with Stewart and George C. Scott as out-of-town prosecuting attorney Claude Dancer on opposing sides of a murder case, using every trick and strategy to win over the jury. Ben Gazzara and Lee Remick are Lieut. Manion and his wife Laura Manion, who are the centre of the case, with Gazzara, as a Korean War veteran, charged with the murder of a bar employee who allegedly raped Gazzara's wife. Laura is a free spirit who likes male companionship. It is the murder charge, however, that the court must decide. Arthur O'Connell, as Parnell McCarthy, plays a down-on-his-luck lawyer who assists Jimmy Stewart in the leg work and research. Eve Arden is Maida Rutledge, Biegler's secretary, who also fetches beer and keeps track of his personal finances. The courtroom drama is ruled over by the homespun Judge Weaver, played by Joseph Welch, who keeps the courtroom under tight control and makes quick decisions on the line of questioning. The two lawyers engage in a verbal sparring match that must be one of the most dynamic courtroom confrontations ever filmed. A very satisfying movie that never lags despite its length, I would recommend it without hesitation. Full value to director Otto Preminger, one of Hollywood's great directors.",

            "content": "In what could only be interpreted in a cosmic sort of irony, I watched \"Anatomy of a Murder\" shortly after serving a stint of jury duty. Thus, I was in the right frame of mind for this kind of film. Unfortunately, it doesn't rise above being a strict courtroom drama.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees country lawyer Paul Biegler (James Stewart) defending soldier Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara) for murdering a man who had supposedly raped his wife Laura Manion (Lee Remick). During the long trial, Biegler runs into hot-shot city lawyer Claude Dancer (George C. Scott), who engages him in a battle of wits right up to the very end of the case.If you view this movie strictly by what goes on inside the courtroom, you would probably have to give it a higher star rating. The sparring between Stewart/Scott is tremendous and produces the best scenes of the entire film. There is also a feeling a tension that the courtroom brings, as with each new witness comes a new wrinkle to the case.The trouble with \"Anatomy of A Murder\", though, is that the experience actually doesn't differ all that much from what I was supposed to do during my jury duty: disregard anything outside of the court proceedings. The film just fails to capture any other semblance of emotion outside the courtroom. Besides Stewart/Scott, the acting is quite pedestrian, and there are certain character arcs that seem interesting at first but (due to the 2:40 runtime) run out of gas by the conclusion. Even the case that is being debated should have had a bigger finale than it did (instead, it left me feeling a bit frustrated that \"all that time\" was spent for such a generic finale).Overall, I am surprised that \"Anatomy of a Murder\" gets such generally high marks. I supposed if one idolizes Jimmy Stewart or really, really is entranced by courtroom dramas it will be better, but I couldn't give it any more than the \"okay\" ranking. There just wasn't enough happening \"outside the court\" to sustain my whole interest.",

It also has a lot of ambiguity throughout, which leaves the viewer wondering at the end what really happened. It's based on a novel written by a Michigan Supreme Court judge, so has the legal procedural stuff down pat. It also has a musical score by Duke Ellington (who also has one line in the film). The setting is a small town in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.Lt. Manion (Ben Gazzara) without question has walked into a bar and shot and killed its owner, Barney Quill (we never see Quill). Manion's wife, Laura (Lee Remick) says that Quill raped her when she went to the bar after her husband was asleep. Laura asks an older former prosecutor, Paul Biegler (Jimmy Stewart) to defend her husband. The local prosecutor, Mitch Lodwick (Brooks West), has brought in a high-powered prosecutor from the state capital to assist. Claude Dancer (George C. Scott) is slick and confrontational. Paul Biegler is folksy and sharp as a tack. Judge Weaver (Joseph N. Welch) oversees the proceedings.There are many machinations in the trial. Did Laura encourage Quill? Was she actually raped? Was Lt. Manion actually not guilty of murder because of \"irresistible impulse\", a defense allowed in Michigan? What actually was the nature of the relationship between Lt. Manion and his wife, Laura?In the end Lt. Manion is found innocent, but the ambiguity does not end.The most interesting actor in the film was Joseph N. Welch, an actual attorney who was famous at the time of the film's making because he was a lawyer that during the Army-McCarthy.I had forgotten how engaging this movie was, and thoroughly enjoyed seeing it again, even though it is over 2 1/2 hours long.",

There was no twist or surprise. If you kill because of passion then it doesn't matter at all if your wife was really raped or not. It is only important what you think that happened. The movie however likes to wallow in erotic expressions and using such 'obscene' words as panty over and over again. The prosecutor never seemed to really want to win his case and we know from experience that Jimmy Stewart isn't a loser in his films.The film had been better if we would have known from the beginning that Mansion was guilty and if the case of the rape would have been mostly omitted.

Sure, it's in black and white, some of the courtroom banter seems a little too tame and not an f- or s-word in it. But you can't really say that this is less engrossing than \"A Few Good Men\", a movie made several decades after.In fact, this is a much more intelligent study of court trial because we are not told, like Roger Ebert wrote in his review of A Few Good Men: What they are gonna do (meaning the defense), how they are gonna do it and when. Almost everything is left to the imagination up until the end.Also, a truly fascinating performance by Ben Gazzara. You can't peg his character. One moment he looks guilty as sin, the other he looks like a victim of circumstance. If you have seen the movie, you know what he did, but like both the defense and prosecuting attorneys argue: The circumstances make the case.James Stewart is his usual quirky self but it doesn't hurt the character he plays. He is in a movie with a pretty heavy subject matter for its time, but he doesn't hold back on the Jimmy Stewart \"aw shucks\" charm that he was famous for, and you know, it fits the character perfectly.Lee Remick is also brilliant. At first, you think she's a bit of a floozy and I hate to admit it, I thought exactly what the prosecutors set her up to be: A woman who had it coming. She turns it all around in one crucial scene between her and Stewart. Look at the change of expression. That's brilliant acting.Of course, you can't forget George C. Scott. Has there ever been a lawyer as cool as him? Not by a long shot. I could go on and on. All the performances are brilliant. Even by the judge (forget his name).The one little flaw is the verdict. I would have liked to see a little hint of the jury's deliberation. Also, the movie does seem to gloss over the psychiatric aspects of the case. The book was more in depth at that argument. By the way, the combined age of the jury looks to be 1200 years. Look at all of those craggy faces. Certainly a great difference from 12 Angry Men where there was a little more age variety.Anyway, if you haven't seen this do yourself a favour if you are into this genre, look it up and see it.

And a story that may have things in it that are morally in quite the grey area! So while this seemed like a clear case at the beginning - open and shut - there is way more to it than meets the eye!

He has to practically order her to stay away from \"men, juke joints, booze, and pinball machines\" and wear a girdle in order to play the part of a \"meek little housewife\" rather than that of a happy-go-lucky party girl. She also agrees to give up her tight-fitting clothes and wears a formal dress, glasses, a hat and a woman's suit in court.Biegler's folksy speech and laid-back demeanor hides a sharp legal mind and a propensity for courtroom theatrics that has the judge busy keeping things under control. However, the case for the defense does not go well, especially since the local D.A. (Brooks West) is assisted by a high-powered big city prosecutor named Dancer (George C. Scott). Furthermore, the prosecution goes all the way to block any mention of Manion's motive for killing Quill, i.e. the raping of Laura. Biegler eventually manages to get the rape issue into the record and Judge Weaver (Joseph N. Welch) agrees to allow the matter to be part of the deliberations. However, Dancer's cross-examination of Laura effectively portrays her as a woman who was not satisfied with her marriage and openly flirted with other men, including the one she claimed raped her.What happens next in the courtroom is for you to find out.As a proud owner of this DVD, I highly recommend this film to you, as it will keep you glued to your seats till the end.Score: 10/10.

Jimmy Stewart and George Scott are, perhaps, the only stars of the time whose reputations endure.

Stewart, the shrewd folksy lawyer for the cucumber-cool defendant, Ben Garzarra, Scott as the \"big-time\" co-prosecutor from Lansing, Lee Remick as provocative sex symbol and rape victim, Eve Arden as the wise-cracking secretary all handle their parts with aplomb, and the score by Duke Ellington, who makes a cameo appearance, is also wonderful.

Not that it was the first film to feature a trial and the courtroom, of course, but it was one of the first ones to make the narrative dynamics develop around the story the lawyers can create out of invented or manipulated facts. The funny things to observe in this kind of court depictions, and cat and mice game between defenders and prosecutors is how words, and the interpretation one makes of words, and how words are thrown (this includes expressions, body and facial ones) can completely change the reality of things. The film is, as the title suggests, the dissection of an event we never get to see, occurred in sets with which we are not so much in touch with. So we have to visualize, and we do that through words and the opinion we form of the characters (witnesses) we are allowed to see so in a way we are at the same level of the jury. What's strong about this film, and why it worked well to me, is that, even though we spend the film following Stewart and the defense, we're never led to believe that we should believe Gazzara's character or story. There are a lot of subtleties, questions left open. Ultimately, the two theories exposed in court made sense, but we really don't know which one (if any of them) is true:-were the facial bruises of the wife made by the murdered or the murderer? -were the panties really where found, or were they planted? -did the wife ever betray the husband?... I enjoyed this ambiguity.Sex was present throughout. I am young, and this is a good way to see how certain things were regarded than: sex and religion. The fuss over the use of the word 'panties' in the courtroom, of course, but also how the prosecutor tries to dismiss the wife by alleging her disregard towards her religion. How that could blow a case in the minds of the jury (and i suppose, the audience 50 years ago). We had two kind of screen female characters depicted: the flashy overtly sexy Lee Remick (whose character would go to a bar with bare naked legs!) and the introspective, closed and mysterious Kathryn Grant. As a screen character i am more interested in the second, as i saw the film i made the mental exercise of switching their parts, or at least, make Remick look more like Grant. I recommend you do that.On purely visual/cinematic concerns, there are two things to point out here, pretty competent and which made the experience worthwhile, to me: one is how the camera moves: it inherited most of what Hitchcock had been making in previous years; including the beautiful 'Rope' and 'Rear window', both featuring Stewart; this means we have a seeking camera, a curious camera which in this case is worried more with characters than with space, even though space usually unfolds as a consequence of what characters do. This is pretty competent, and had been done with a very high level 2 years before, with Lumet's '12 angry men'. I think here we have a mid term between Hitchcock and Lumet's attitude. It's less consequent, not original, but still a pretty competent camera work. The other thing is jazz. Ellington, who even does a cameo playing with his band. Stewart's characters plays the piano also, and the virtuous beat of the Duke really does it. It's a cinematic glue, something that carries the films, as much as the inflated performance by Stewart or our inner questions regarding the veracity of the case we're being exposed.My opinion: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",

The film was based on the 1958 novel of the same name by Michigan Supreme Court Justice John D. Voelker.One former local prosecutor has taken a peculiar case. Specifically, an army lieutenant has confessed to killing his wife's rapist. The lieutenant, with the help of his new defense attorney, claims that he does not remember the murder. The main feature of the defendant is temporary mental incapacity. However, some visible facts are not on his side....The story is interesting and somewhat realistic. It was complemented with a sharp dialogue and explicit themes. Mr. Preminger has presented a dramatic, but a proper and comprehensive judicial process. He has pointed, through some notable scenes, the difference between law and justice. The protagonists are shifty characters in an uncertain courtroom drama. The conflict is reduced to a battle between prosecutors and defense counsel, through comic theatricality and mutual insinuations.James Stewart as Paul Biegler is a clever and resourceful lawyer. The protagonist who, with his petty bourgeois, regularly draws aces from the hole. Mr. Stewart has offered, as usual, very good performance. Lee Remick as Laura Manion is rather unconvincing as a faithful and flirty wife at the same time. The complexity is perhaps the biggest flaw of her character. However, I think that Mr. Preminger has wanted to provoke an ironic attitude towards her character by the audience. George C. Scott as Claude Dancer is a skilled and consistent prosecutor, who has become a sort of antagonist. Ben Gazzara as Lt. Frederick Manion is a cold and nervous defendant. Joseph N. Welch as Judge Weaver, despite his sporadic cynicism, is too stereotypical character.This is a bit tiring, but very interesting trial, which, through ironic and cynical attitudes, solves the mystery.",

            "content": "ANATOMY OF A MURDER is a riveting and powerful courtroom drama that still makes for mesmerizing entertainment even though its 1959 release was eclipsed by BEN-HUR being released the same year. I saw this film for the first time about a year ago and still found it fascinating from start to finish. Otto Preminger, a director who was known for pushing the dramatic envelope, mounted this superb drama about a laid back, unassuming country lawyer who decides to defend a soldier who has been accused of murdering a man who tried to rape his wife. Preminger assembled a first rate cast here, featuring actors at the peak of their careers as well as future stars who show here why they became stars. Ben Gazzara exudes a quiet intensity as the soldier on trial; Lee Remick (replacing Lana Turner) lights up the screen as his sexy, nubile young wife; George C. Scott is electrifying as the prosecuting attorney; Arthur O'Connell is the defense attorney's leg man; Joseph Welch as the Judge; Eve Arden as a wisecracking secretary, and towering above them all is James Stewart, in a powerhouse performance, as Paul Biegler, the small town attorney whose laid back persona belies his brilliance as a defense attorney. Preminger brings us a very adult (for 1959) drama that still packs a wallop today, accentuated by a jazzy music score by Duke Ellington and an effective screenplay by Wendell Mayes. A true classic...they don't make 'em like this anymore.",

            "content": "Otto Preminger was a capable director who knew how to use actors. If we remember Gene Tierney today, it's probably because we loved the use Preminger made of her in Laura. Lee Remick looks sensational in this movie because Preminger photographs her lovingly in rich black-and-white against plain surroundings. You'll remember her performance a lot longer than you'll remember the character she plays.My difficulty with this movie is the excessive length: 2h40m. I realize that directors then were experimenting with longer running times, but in a courtroom drama brevity is important. The viewer is not interested in case law from the nineteenth century, they want drama and truth. Witness For the Prosecution (1957) takes 1h56m to tell a story that is every bit as complicated as Preminger's, while Compulsion (1959) gets the job done in 1h43m. I was sitting in my chair, fighting the urge to press the skip button on my remote.Apart from Remick, I enjoyed James Stewart as the defence lawyer: he's not afraid to show an unpleasant side to his personality. Eve Arden is as appealing as she was on her TV series. George C. Scott as the hot-shot DA from Lansing has a few effective scenes, although his character has little influence on the plot. Only O'Connell as the drunken lawyer failed to interest me in any way.",

            "content": "\"Anatomy of a Murder\" is a 161 minute black and white courtroom drams that some might consider overlong. I disagree. Producer/Director Otto Preminger holds the viewer's interest throughout. It sports a top line cast right down to the last witness.Army Lieutenant Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara) is accused of murdering local bar tender Barney Quill because he had allegedly raped his wife Laura (Lee Remick). She comes to local small town lawyer Paul Biegler (James Stewart) for help. Biegler who was recently replaced as the local District Attorney, has been living in semi retirement.. He interviews both Manion and Laura before deciding to take the case. He has his suspicions that the flirtatious Laura may be hiding some important information, however he decides to take the case.Biegler calls upon his boozy fellow lawyer Parnell Emmett McCarthy (Arthur O'Connell) to assist him. He convinces McCarthy to put down the bottle. They decide to employ the temporary insanity defense since Manion has a short fuse and has a history of jealous outbursts over the flirtations of his wife.In the court room with Judge Weaver (Joseph N. Welch - a real judge) in charge, Biegler begins to mount his defense. He is up against the current D,A. Mitch Lodwick (Brooks West) who has brought in big city lawyer Claude Dancer (George C. Scott) to assist him. Biegler gets army psychiatrist Dr. Smith (Orson Bean) to attest to Manion's \"temporary insanity\" during the alleged crime. Dancer meanwhile challenges Laura's story. She maintains that Quill had indeed raped her and had beaten her afterwards thus angering her jealous husband to kill the so called rapist.Biegler manages to get the jury to buy his defense and Manion gets acquitted. But we the viewers are left to wonder if Laura really was raped (the medical examiner could find no evidence of rape) or did she seduce Quill or was their relationship consensual? There is no doubt as to Manion's short and violent temper but did he deliver the bruises to Laura rather than Quill? Dancer suggests an affair between Quill and his manager Mary Pilant (Kathryn Grant) but she soon explains the situation. A very complex story to say the least.The performances are excellent across the board. Stewart as always leads the way with Scott and Remick, close behind. Welch as the judge gives a nice balance to the proceedings. In addition, we have Eve Adren as Maida Rutledge the faithful secretary and Murray Hamilton, Ken Lynch, Howard McNear and Joseph Kearns as various witnesses and John Qualen as the Deputy Sheriff.Mesmerizing from start to finish.",

            "content": "Tightly written and passionately acted, ANATOMY OF A MURDER never feels a minute of its almost three-hour length. I was riveted the entire time, needing to know how the case would turn out. And even by the end, the story is still cloaked in heavy ambiguity. I spent much of the middle part of the movie believing the Manions were lying entirely, but certain revelations at the end cast everything into doubt. By the end, I still did not know what exactly happened-- and no one in that courtroom did either. There's an almost RASHOMON-effect to the whole story, but not everyone seems convinced they're even telling the truth-- they're saying whatever makes them look the most noble of the whole bunch.I think the most impressive feat accomplished by this movie is that it has the audience rooting for Paul Biegler even though he is far from a heroic figure. He never seems particularly convinced in the innocence of the Manions and only loses what little faith he had in them as their apparent dysfunction becomes all too clear in the courtroom. He takes on the case because he needs the bread and wants to win, not due to any higher ideals about justice and that is fascinating.",

They keep you into this courtroom trial, though interesting, seemingly forever and then give you a little trite and predictable ending. Seems like such a waste. Also you don't really get to know Manion, the guy who's fate is being determined, so you don't care much for him. Character development has come a long way since this film.

            "content": "\"Anatomy of a Murder\" is based on a novel, which was itself based on a real 1952 murder case. The author of the novel, John Voelker, had been Counsel for the defence at that trial, although he published it under a pen name. The film was a controversial one when first released in 1959 because of its surprisingly frank treatment, at a time when the Production Code was still in force, of sexual matters. It is said to be the first mainstream Hollywood movie to use the word \"contraceptive\" (and also the first to use \"spermatogenesis\", although in that case it was probably the last as well). Even the word \"panties\" raised some eyebrows.In a small town in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Lieutenant Frederick Manion, a US Army officer, is arrested and charged with shooting dead a bartender named Barney Quill. Manion does not deny killing Quill, but claims that he was justified in doing so because Quill had raped his wife Laura. His lawyer Paul Biegler has to point out to him that the fact that the victim was an alleged rapist, or even a proven rapist, is not a defence to a charge of murder. Biegler's suggestion is that Manion should claim that the killing was the result of an \"irresistible impulse\" amounting in law to temporary insanity. With some difficulty he persuades Manion to plead not guilty on this basis, setting the stage for a courtroom drama.The odds at first seem stacked in favour of the prosecution. Biegler is a former district attorney who failed to be re-elected; since the election he has tried to revive his private practice, but with little success, and spends most of his time on his hobbies of fishing and playing jazz piano. He agrees to take the brief to defend Manion even though he has little experience of defence work. His assistant in the case is his old friend Parnell McCarthy, an elderly alcoholic. The prosecution are represented by Mitch Lodwick, the district attorney who defeated Biegler in the election and by Claude Dancer from the State Attorney-General's office.Manion is clearly a man of strong passions with a hot temper; he has a distinguished war record in Korea, but the prosecution team are able to use this against him, showing that he is a man habituated to killing. All this makes the task of the defence team harder, especially as Laura comes across as provocative and flirtatious. Although she is only in her early to mid-twenties, Manion is her second husband. Biegler and Dancer are strongly contrasted. (Lodwick is something of a cypher). Biegler at first seems out of his depth, a second-rate small-town hick up against Dancer, a hot-shot trial lawyer from the big city. Yet it gradually becomes clear that beneath Biegler's apparently bumbling manner he is more crafty and experienced than he at first appears, not above using some dubiously ethical ploys to assist his client. Dancer can be formidable in cross-examination, but he can also come across as a bully and allows his feelings to run away with him. A key scene comes when he is examining Laura, trying to persuade her to admit that her sexual encounter with Quill was consensual and almost drooling over the attractive young woman as he gets much closer to her than courtroom etiquette would normally permit.The acting in the four leading roles- from Ben Gazzara as Manion, Lee Remick as Laura, James Stewart as Biegler and George C. Scott as Dancer. Scott, hitherto better-known for his work in the theatre and not yet a major Hollywood star, received a \"Best Supporting Actor\" nomination in what was only his second feature film. (He was to receive another in his third, \"The Hustler\"). The film received a total of seven Oscar nominations, including \"Best Picture\" and \"Best Actor\" for Stewart, but did not win any. 1959 was the year of \"Ben-Hur\", and other films found it difficult to get a look in. Special mention should also go to the jazz score composed by Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn.Perhaps surprisingly, Otto Preminger was not nominated for \"Best Director\". The running-time is around two-and-a-half hours, surprisingly long for a film which tells a single story with no subplots and contains no action scenes; neither the rape nor the killing is shown on screen, but this length can be justified by the need to explore some complex legal issues and the personalities of those involved in the case. Preminger handles his material superbly, never allowing the attention of the audience to flag or allowing them to feel that the length is excessive. Sixty years after it was made \"Anatomy of a Murder\" still holds up well. Unless you count \"Twelve Angry Men\", in which most of the action takes place in the jury-room rather than the courtroom itself, it remains my favourite courtroom drama. It reminds us that the law is about real people and that all those courtroom theatrics have a purpose. 9/10",

            "content": "This ahead-of-its-time courtroom drama is infamous for its frank discussion of sex and sexual violence, which pushed the limits of what was allowed by the strict production code of the time and caused some - including, apparently, star Stewart's father - to label it as \"pornographic\". Today, of course, 'Anatomy Of A Murder (1959)' seems relatively mild. That's not to say that it's lost any of its power, though. The picture essentially places its audience in the same position as its jury, presenting the facts of its focal case - alongside some subtle suggestion as to what they may add up to - without ever overtly telling us what actually went down on the night of the murder in question or, perhaps more importantly, revealing the motives behind any of those events. The story is incredibly compelling because of this; it's a very active viewing experience that constantly causes you to shift your perspective. Its characters aren't what you'd typically consider to be heroic, either. In fact, the leading lawyer does some fairly shady things in his effort to alleviate the punishment coming his killer client's way. Yet, he has an amazingly charming and captivating courtroom presence. It's this, rather than any redeeming quality of the man on trial, that makes you want to see things go the ageing attorney's way. That court case is an invigorating and entertaining one. It's rather realistic (it is based on real events, after all) and it brings up all sorts of interesting ethical questions, too. The movie is clearly one of the best courtroom dramas of all time. Its commanding lead performance complements its high-quality, surprisingly candid screenplay. 8/10",

I remember Jean Stapleton's portrayal of Edith Bunker in \"All in the Family\" after she was the victim of an attempted rape. She was terrified even to answer the door.

            "content": "\"Anatomy of a Murder\" is an excellent motion picture that showcases one of James Stewart's finest performances. His character - Paul Biegler, attorney at law - is a modest, small-town, cigar-chomping gentleman who, as established in the film's opening, spends a great deal of time as an expert fisherman and an accomplished jazz pianist. But underneath this seemingly easygoing and uncomplicated exterior lies quite a brilliant steel-trap legal mind, ready to take on a challenge and refusing to accept any nonsense from anybody. The end result is a more-than-convincing characterization of a lawyer, thanks to James Stewart's tireless work ethic as an actor. (Please DO NOT read the next few paragraphs if you have not yet seen this movie.) Paul Biegler's monumental task in \"Anatomy of a Murder\" is to defend a lieutenant in the United States Army named Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara), who is on trial for murdering a bartender who apparently raped his wife Laura (Lee Remick). This becomes a challenging case for Biegler, who surmises that his client is a violent, abusive husband, and that Laura is morally unstable and flirtatious with other men, thus possibly enticing the otherwise likable bartender to rape her. In spite of the fact that Biegler has his doubts about the moral character of Lt. Manion & his wife, Biegler is still determined to crack the case and get Manion out of jail.Director Otto Preminger could not have chosen a better cast for \"Anatomy of a Murder.\" Two up-and-coming actors in particular absolutely loved working with James Stewart and appreciated his professionalism; they are Ben Gazzara as the not-very-likable defendant Lt. Manion, and George C. Scott as the sharp-minded attorney general Claude Dancer, serving as the prosecutor. Not to mention Lee Remick as the slinky, voluptuous Laura Manion; Eve Arden as Biegler's somewhat sharp-tongued & witty secretary Maida; Arthur O'Connell as Biegler's alcoholic-turned-sober law associate Parnell McCarthy; Kathryn Grant as the sad-faced Mary Pilant, who unwillingly becomes the ultimate source of help for Biegler; and a non-actor named Joseph N. Welch, a real-life Boston lawyer (famous for speaking out against Senator Joseph McCarthy) who does a fine acting job as the presiding magistrate. Also, watch for Joseph Kearns (Mr. Wilson in the \"Dennis the Menace\" TV series) in a small role as commercial photographer Lloyd Burke.My favorite moments from \"Anatomy of a Murder\" include the following. Some of Biegler's more dramatic moments in the courtroom include his analogy about separating \"the core from an apple without breaking the skin\" (in order to introduce the story about the rape), his outburst at prosecutor Mitch Lodwick (Brooks West) for supposedly turning a cross-examination into a high school debate, and his tension-building interrogations of the annoyed bartender Alphonse Pacquette (Murray Hamilton), nearly resulting in a blowup. The temperamental Lt. Manion displays his fury at the prosecution's hastily placing upon the witness stand one of his cell mates, who may or may not be lying about personal conversations he's had with Manion. In one of the lighter moments in the courtroom, Biegler shows the court Laura's little dog Muff, who carried a flashlight in its mouth on the night of the rape & murder; Muff clearly \"doesn't know who his enemies are\" as he runs, with the flashlight, towards Mr. Dancer and jumps on him. At a dance hall shortly before the beginning of the trial, Biegler, after spotting the tipsy Laura dancing with another soldier, seizes his opportunity to scare some discipline into Laura, escorting her out of the hall and driving her home. Incidentally, the leader of the jazz quintet, with whom Biegler sits in, is arguably the greatest American composer & bandleader of the 20th Century: Duke Ellington! Bearing the character name of Pie Eye, Ellington wrote a fantastic music score for this courtroom drama. (Some have debated as to whether Ellington's score fits the movie, but author Jonathan Coe accurately described the score as \"weirdly appropriate.\") To summarize, \"Anatomy of a Murder\" is a fine, entertaining, and riveting courtroom drama with superb acting, fine direction, suspenseful moments, and a great music score. Not to mention that the film contains some of the finest work of my favorite actor Mr. James Stewart.",

The plot covers the defence attorney's attempt to convince the jury that his client's act was temporary insanity.Directed by Otto Preminger, the film is based on a book which itself was inspired from a real-life case and is a work of expert craftsmanship. Meticulously researched as well, it presents an authentic atmosphere of a courtroom & is also pretty sound in the depiction of the investigation carried out by the lawyers themselves in the preparation of their cases.The black-n-white cinematography plays its part rather well while editing keeps the whole story tightly arranged & finely moving from start to finish. The cast comprises of James Stewart, Lee Remick, Ben Gazzara, George C. Scott & Brooks West amongst which both Stewart & Scott manage to stand out, thanks to their verbal energy & charismatic on-screen presence.On an overall scale, Anatomy of a Murder features just the right dose of comedy, mystery & drama to go with its act and also offers an insight into the role an impressive showmanship can play inside the courtroom. Notorious for its language which was quite explicit for its time & brilliantly painting the morally ambiguous portrait of its characters, this classic courtroom drama is one of the finest examples of its genre that comes thoroughly recommended.",

            "content": "I was going to start this analysis of this penultimate courtroom picture by saying that Anatomy of a Murder is not just a courtroom drama, a murder thriller, or even a character study, and that it encompasses all of the aspects of life from which those things come in drama, and maybe I would have been right. But even if I am, I could construct an examination more simply by just saying that it is a courtroom drama that goes beyond what most courtroom dramas envision as the call of duty. Its long-drawn-out sequences of extreme tension seem to inconspicuously grow from expository scenes that lounge casually like a Cassavetes film, like the first fifteen minutes with Jimmy Stewart and Arthur O'Connell.What I like about Otto Preminger is that he is relentless, and in 1957, that was surely clear as day to anyone walking into the local movie house. There is a glaring reality to his work, even The Man With the Golden Arm, which seems to unravel from the perspective of Sinatra's intoxicated character in a sort of surreal way but still feels like the most honest depiction of life itself. Perhaps Anatomy of a Murder is the same sort of aesthetic, a world depicted from the perspective of its protagonist, Jimmy Stewart, who unlike Sinatra's Frankie Machine is a clear-headed, seasoned and taurine realist.Lee Remick plays the flirtatious wife of a very young Ben Gazzara, who is charged with murder for shooting a barkeeper who allegedly raped her. Her character's purpose is to cause internal conflict within Jimmy Stewart's defense attorney by endangering their case with her exhibition and flirtation, all rooted from how stunningly drop-dead sexy she is. But the movie has nothing to do with that. That's all Lee Remick. I had a hard time getting up when the movie was over because my loins were parched and blistered with heat, or maybe that was my hand working on its own. Everything in the movie is as real as if it were happening in your living room.The great Duke Ellington not only wrote the jazz score, but appears for a moment playing the piano in a club with Stewart and ostensibly playing himself! And he is given one awesomely infectious period line: \"You're not splittin' the scene, man?\" And there's a superb performance as the presiding judge, shrewd and cunning in a rather humorous way, by Joseph N. Welch, the Boston attorney who shattered Joseph McCarthy on TV in 1954.Complementing the drama in the intriguing and truly perplexing ambiguity of the defendant and his wife, there is the geniality and earthy wisdom of Stewart and O'Connell. O'Connell is a clever but boozing Irishman of great presence, and he and Stewart both have had it up to here with people's crap, and they do not see much reason to repress that sensation. George C. Scott, as the prosecution attorney, has the suave menace that really reminds you that he is quite a terrific actor.",

This is the type of world in which we live, and it is the world of \"Anatomy of a Murder.\"*spoilers* While the movie does not use sleepwalking as a reason of innocence (what fiction writer could come up with that?), it uses the now-overused temporary insanity rule.  He was crazy, so he killed his wife's rapist.  But was she really raped?  The doctor said no, and her husband seems insanely jealous. She is practically a town flirt.  With methods outside, and some in, the courtroom which are still used in modern justice and fiction, the movie still seems fresh.Some of the in courtroom methods may seem over-the-top, they are still around today.  In the last Jeffrey Feiger case in Michigan, the lawyers traded insults regularly, and the judge even got into it.  I've heard that people almost brought popcorn.  But with the wisecracks from all of the lawyers, and the judge, the courtroom scenes are not that intense.  But, how many scenes are like the \"You can't handle the truth\" revelation in \"A Few Good Men\" in real life?  Check out this movie simply for the courtroom banter, and the story and the issues, and the acting, and the score.  Hell, the movie is almost perfect. My only complaint is that the first forty minutes could have been cut down a little.  The rest of the movie is great as a courtroom drama/comedy.  Check it out.9/10",

            "content": "It was less than ten years ago I watched It's A Wonderful Life for the first (I know, I know shocking.) Then it was last year after watching it again (it's a staple in my film rotation now of course) I fell in love with Jimmy Stewart. The man is a legend for a reason. He is mesmerizing on screen. I was very excited to watch this latest film because I had never heard of it and stumbled on it for 1$ in a Goodwill store. Simply put...wow. This is legendary film right here. It was easily one of the most unique, brilliantly written courtroom dramas I have ever seen. The first thing I noticed was the run time...nearly three hours for a courtroom drama...that seemed excessive and I thought for sure it would drag longer than it needed to. The magic of this film is that it doesn't drag for even a minute. The characters are so vibrant and the story intriguing and real and you can relate to it. More than 3/4 of the film is in a courtroom and its witness, question, re-direct, question, witness, question and so on and so forth. You are watching a murder case unfold and you cannot turn away from it. It is a mystery of sorts but the investigation is simple and straight forward and then you're in the throes of the legal system.Jimmy Stewart just simply mesmerizes in this movie. His jaded and often sarcastic Paul Biegler is such an amazing character. Its not an in your face and over the top performance but he endears himself to you and is incredibly convincing in this role. He is subtly brilliant and watching him do what he obviously does best is perfect for the film. There is a back story to his character that certainly doesn't get in the way of the main plot but still does a lot to give him some depth. The stunning Lee Remick plays the wife of the accused. She is a sassy and perhaps abused woman dealing with issues she has with men. If there is one character I wanted to know more about it was hers but she is excellent in the part and her chemistry with Stewart is perfect. Ben Gazzara is the accused murderer and he is also very good. His character is brooding and stoic and he isn't very likable which is the entire idea behind his character. The very first interaction between him and Stewart shows that the two men don't like each other but Stewart still goes above and beyond to get him off. Arthur O'Connell is the perfect addition as Stewart's partner and adds a certain emotional depth to Stewart's character. O'Connell doesn't have a big role but its enough to really be important to the cast. Eve Arden also has a small role and yet it helps to really give depth and an emotional connection for Stewart's character who may come across as hard and jaded at times. Perhaps the only characters in the film that lacked depth and we're even very shallow performances were George C. Scott (a BRILLIANT actor but not so much this time around), Brooks West and Joseph Welch as our esteemed Judge who just seems bored and deliver his lines poorly.This film is brilliantly made. It was like they covered each and every detail and made sure it made sense and was fascinating enough and each character had purpose and would appeal to the audiences. All their bases are covered that make this a near perfect film watching experience. Otto Preminger should be heralded for this piece of film history because I just noticed so many little details that make this great. I think the film also stands up to the test of time because it actually is way ahead of its time. I mean it was banned in many cinemas due to some \"salty\" language for the time (panties was one of those words just to give you an idea of what I mean by \"salty\") But beyond that I feel like Stewart and his team are forward thinkers and there is a moral message here about the law and perhaps even a satirical look at the legal system. It was fascinating. Law students should latch onto this and if you're looking for a film that you can talk about for hours or you can just sit back and enjoy this is one to see! This was truly terrific. This is why classic films are considered the cream of the crop. Where are the films like this anymore? Brilliant. 9.5/10",

After \"To Kill A Mockingbird,\" this is the greatest crime thriller I have seen.Not to mention how pathetic the direction & cinematography is, the tight cast performance, brilliant plot narration & amazing use of humor makes me rate it 8.0 out of 10. Oh, it could've been better.Since the beginning James Stewart makes his viewers glued to the screen with his performance. He is subtle & straightforward. George C Scott brings a whole new dimension into it. Supporting cast is cool, as well. The story is so dynamic, it evolves step-by-step and the writer has managed not to bore with the advocacy jargon. Having references rape, sex & murder factors in abundance, this is a must watch solely because of its boldness. And the courtroom sequences is sure to make you jump out of your seats.BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended due to its humor, cast performance & plot!Profanity: Mild | Nudity: No | Sex/Foreplay: No visuals | Violence: Mild | Gore: No | Drugs: No | Alcohol/Smoking: Strong",

            "review_title": "The best courtroom drama of all time",
            "content": "This is the greatest court room drama ever made. Generally, I would not make such a bold statement, but this film is fantastic. The best part is that it is based on a true story. John Voelker (pen name Robert Traver) was the defense attorney in the case the book and film \"Anatomy of a Murder\" is based on. Voelker managed to get a not guilty verdict for a lieutenant in the military accused of killing a saloon keeper based on temporary insanity. This case to this day is folk lore in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.I'll go into the plot briefly (I want you to see this movie for yourself rather than give a detailed account). Paul Biegler (James Stewart) is a former Prosecutor now in private practice. He is hired by a Mrs. Manion (Lee Remick) to defend her husband Lt. Manion (Ben Gazzara) for murder. Lt. Manion shot and killed a bar keeper named Barney Quill who had allegedly raped Mrs. Manion several hours prior to the shooting.What makes the film work is the interplay between each character. Biegler is in the middle, but constantly has Mrs. Manion, Lt. Manion, Parnell (an old attorney friend), his secretary, the District Attorney and Assistant Attorney General, or Judge to play off of. Stewart does a great job of balancing these conflicting personalities with Biegler's own.The cast in this movie is superb. James Stewart, Lee Remick, Arthur O'Connell, George C. Scott, Eve Arden, and more. Otto Preminger does a fantastic job of directing an already great production. Voelker (who served on the Michigan Supreme Court) wrote an intricate and legally savvy book, which is followed closely in this film. However, the story shows legal and ethical questions in an easy to understand light. Even though there is some content that only a lawyer could truly appreciate, anyone can understand what is going on and sense the suspense. Add great actors and great direction to an excellent book and you've got a classic. To boot, Duke Ellington performed a great soundtrack for the movie that adds so much atmosphere to the film.The movie was filmed in Marquette County, Michigan at the courthouse where the actual trial happened. Being a young lawyer practicing in the Upper Peninsula, I someday hope to try a case in that courtroom.On the humorous side, the door that the judge in the movie opens in the corridor to reveal a law library is actually the men's room.",

            "content": "Who knew you could find Duke Ellington appearing in a saloon in the upper peninsula of Michigan? His score for the film was wonderful. Just in case you were expecting the law office of James Stewart, Arthur O'Connell, and Eve Arden to consist of hicks from the sticks, Duke Ellington's score reminds us otherwise. The quintessence of sophistication, Ellington gives us a score that perfectly suits Stewart's small town lawyer, who turns out to be sharp, knowing, and tough.And it perfectly suits a story that is about the rape of a woman who (in one critic's phrasing) \"would flirt with a fire hydrant,\" her husband, a defendant who is perfectly capable of beating her, and the woman's missing panties, not something that is normally talked about in 1950s movies, let alone as often as they are in this picture.Once again James Stewart makes acting look so easy that one may well overlook the fact that he was a truly fine actor--subtle yet commanding, familiar to all as a screen persona yet resourceful and versatile.George C. Scott gives new meaning to the words \"slick,\" \"cynical,\" and even \"despicable.\" Ben Gazzara and Lee Remick are both fully credible, and in the end, when Gazzara is acquitted, we know that neither person deserves our sympathy. The triumph goes to Stewart's character and his colleagues, played by two wonderful character actors,Arthur O'Connell, and Eve Arden.It's a really great courtroom drama that stands up well 50 years later.",

            "content": "Gregory, the movie cat, had the same mixed feelings about this film as I did. He yawned and left after 15 minutes, his whiskers twitching in boredom. However, he did return for the last hour or so and purred intermittently. A solid 6 from both of us.There are a few reasons about why this film just doesn't quite work. I'll get the first out of the way quickly--the score. Somehow, jazz for a rural courtroom drama just seems wrong--and like most jazz, it's a cacophonous noise. However, realizing that this is in part my idiosyncratic reaction, that just looses 1 point of 10.The rating of 6 builds up from the performances--particularly James Stewart, as good as he ever has been (except perhaps for Vertigo). Joseph Welch, as the judge, and Arthur O'Connell, as Stewart's colleague, both provide textbook examples of superior character performances. Lee Remick enjoys a star turn as the wife who may (or may not?) have been raped; Ben Gazzara is solid as the murderer who may, or may not, have been acting under \"irresistible impulse\"; and George C. Scott gives a memorably showy performance as a reptilian prosecuting attorney. And how can you not love Eve Arden, even if she were only to read the phone book?And the gap? Frankly, the film is just plain too long and the pacing too languid. Much of the first hour seems like filler. The trial, which occupies the last hour and forty minutes, is far better, but still is more than a little prolix.I'm not going to comment on some of the attitudes towards the attitudes towards rape; they are of their time and need to be seen as such without pious feminist posturing.Call this one a near miss. When you watch, be forewarned. If only you could filter out the soundtrack.....",

            "content": "***User reviewer telegonus (\"Gray Anatomy\", telegonus from brighton, ma, 15 July 2001) and Camera Obscura (\"Absolutely first-rate courtroom drama, fascinating all the way\", Camera Obscura from The Dutch Mountains, 8 January 2007) both have good summaries.*** \"Anatomy of a Murder\" (1959, Otto Preminger\ufeff), a desk-slapping courtroom drama\ufeff, is as compelling as it is ambiguous. Set in a small town in Michigan\ufeff, it connects very well with rural, patriotic America. (Characters routinely take country detours with their dialogue.) Despite the lack of mystery in who killed who, \"Anatomy\" is one of cinema's greatest trial films.Everyone agrees that Army Lt. Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara) shot and killed a barman because he believed the latter had raped and assaulted his flirtatious wife, Laura (Lee Remick). However, we are never made completely certain she was raped. Nor are we entirely sure that Lt. Manion wasn't the one who beat his spouse. Because many of the key details are unresolved we feel like jurors unsure of who is lying. Also, by deciding whether an Army Lieutenant was insane when he committed murder we are participating in a specialized legal point. This is a sophisticated law movie despite the country bumpkin backdrop.One of the (much-discussed) characteristics of Otto Preminger's visual style is the unusual absence of cutaways. By never seeing a close-up of someone in the courtroom reacting to the current testimony, the audience is denied an obvious clue about what participants are really thinking. The effect works here, elevating our interest with the rapid-fire legal exchanges. (I wonder if any real trial in history ever had so many objections by counsel. Also, would Biegler not be disbarred immediately for uttering so many slanderous accusations about his legal rivals?) A recurring theme is the idea of a substitute. Examples abound, such as the knowledge that the judge (Joseph N. Welch) is filling in for the sitting judge (who is ailing). There are two prosecutors for Michigan. Laura wears a hat for half the trial until she is asked to remove it, exposing her bountiful hair. Biegler's colleague and buddy Parnell (Arthur O'Connell) morphs from being a drunk and emotional wreck to sobriety and being of value to a law firm. There is Biegler's surprise at the boyish appearance of the Army psychologist. Jimmy Stewart\ufeff and Duke Ellington both sit and play the same piano, etc. The appearance of so many substitutes parallels our feelings towards Lt. Manion. As we learn more about the Manions, we begin to consider the possibility that the husband is a cold manipulator using the insanity defense for convenience only.Jimmy Stewart's portrayal of Paul Biegler is a tour du force. The rest of the cast is also superb. Ben Gazzara and Lee Remick are very effective and believable as small-town provocateurs. George C. Scott makes Claude Dancer, the Assistant State's Attorney, seem sufficiently formidable. Eve Arden is very good as Biegler's street-wise secretary. O'Connell portrays the self-pitying Parnell amiably. While Ken Lynch (as a Detective) has a small role, both he and Murray Hamilton as (Alphonse, the bartender) are both superb, scene-chewing character actors in all their films. Duke Ellington's jazzy score is excellent.By the way, almost every character relishes tobacco. (Jimmy Stewart's cheroot is likely announcing his presence very effectively.) It seems legitimate to opine that while audiences viewing \"Anatomy\" 55 years after its release are more focused on the health risks of smoking, we have lost the depth of appreciation that Americans used to have regarding courts of law.Cinephiles should take a break from cleaning freshly-caught trout and return to the revival theater that shows this first-rate courtroom drama. To paraphrase Noam Chomsky\ufeff, if we don't believe in justice for dirt-balls we don't believe in it for anyone.",

I thought the story wasn't the greatest suspense ever, but the acting and the sequence of event kept it exciting.The acting was really really good, thumbs up for James Stewart and Lee Remick (the raped wife). And I think I am falling in love with black and white movies, I am crazy about the lighting and use of shades. Although the movie is mostly set in the courtroom, the script of the trial is quite interesting, it keeps you wanting to know how will the prosecutor deal with the witnesses and what will happen next. It's simply a classic investigative movie, with a subtle sense of humor.I also absolutely loved Lee Remick's fashion, this outgoing over the top (back then) clothes with high heels and the wavy hair, she is spectacular and is really pretty too. You know what else was really interesting, it's the soundtracks, it old funky jazz, very cool, my favorite was actually the beginning with all the old cartoonish graphics, really enjoyable (a little pink panther kind of music).Let's move to what I didn't like, I thought the movie is way too long 2:40! some scenes were kinda useless. I also wanted to leave the courtroom a little more and that's why I don't have a favorite scene. Also the ending is waaaaay too expected, it killed my buzz.All in all it's a nice interesting movie, not sure how memorable it is, but it's exciting and funny.

            "content": "Let's mention the few positives about the movie first. Duke Ellington's score is wonderful. The black-and-white cinematography by Sam Leavitt is mesmerizing. The director Preminger's steadfast refusal to use the trite narrative device of \"flashbacks\" is admirable. And the movie may have been bold in its treatment of certain topics, and even in its language, in its own era. Which by itself, however, does not make the movie any more enjoyable when viewed in 2016. To illustrate, that was a time when the word \"panties\" was considered dirty. Oh, my.Other than those considerations, the movie is a bloated dud, and excruciating to watch. I only managed to do it in three sittings, because it failed to hold my attention for even a few scenes. The movie is not just boring, but positively annoying to watch, and that's mainly due to uniformly bad performances by all actors. Whenever such is the case in a movie, it is, of course, the director that is to be blamed. And so, I'm afraid that Otto Preminger is the main culprit here.Sorry, but I expect characters in a movie to behave and talk like people in real life behave and talk. I just detest theatrical movies in which all the actors are telegraphing, with every word they utter, \u00e0nd with every gesture or facial expression they make, the following: \"Hey, this is a movie! You're watching a movie! Now, look here, I'm gonna show you what an angry person looks like!\" (Now think back of George C. Scott as the prosecutor.) \"And now I'm gonna show you what a guy looks like who thinks a woman is attractive but can't really say so openly.\" (Think back of James Stewart and all his mannerisms when facing Lee Remick one-on-one.) \"And now I'm gonna show you what a guy looks like when he makes a joke!\" (Think back of the old judge.)Sorry, I'm not buying this type of movie-making. I don't wish to observe obvious theatrical puppets for almost 3 hours. No \"this looks like X, Y, or Z\" for me, please! I'd like to behold X, Y, and Z *directly* \u2013 not merely their theatrical representations. Give me the real thing, please. When I watch a movie, I'd like to believe that these are real persons and real-life situations I'm watching. But while watching _Anatomy of a Murder_, all I could see was an all-star ensemble putting on a show. Admittedly, realistic movies aren't the only type of movies that exists; but what's really objectionable is for a movie to *pretend* it's realistic when in reality, it's only theatrical.Don't get me wrong \u2013 I'm a big-time James Stewart fan and to me, no movie is finer than _Vertigo_ or _It's a Wonderful Life_, but I just couldn't stand Stewart here. He was *playacting* here throughout, and I didn't believe for a second that whom I was observing was some failed small-time lawyer enamoured of fishing.The movie also contains quite a few despicable elements, such as the old lawyer pal extolling the jury system as almost a godsent, supremely dignified institution (are you kidding me?!), or the defendant getting away with what looks like an obvious murder; the trial's verdict seems unjust or random. Now, taking into account how \"jingoistic\", \"pro- army\" public opinion in the US can often be, the assumption cannot be far that if the defendant were anyone other than a \"war hero\", the outcome of the trial might have been very different. Given that the movie is based on a book written by a defence attorney who liberated just such a defendant in a real-life trial, this leaves a really bad taste in the viewer's mouth. It seems as if the author was boasting of the outcome of the trial, when in reality, it's embarrassing. This movie struck me as a celebration of the woefully erratic judicial system, particularly when it's based on a 12-person jury of \"common Joes and Janes\" and on odd precedents dating back to previous centuries.",

The scenes between Scott and Stewart are dynamite. The scenes between Stewart and Remick are squirm-inducing. McCarthy judge Joseph Welch plays the judge and he brings his sublime humor to bear. The great music score is by Duke Ellington and the titles by Saul Bass are among his best.",

How others judge a woman based on her clothes and behavior.I think the way the lawyers and prosecutors are played out are probably very realistic. All the tactics they use and all the objections and witness, evidence etc.The best scene is when Mary Pliant admits on the stand that Barney Quill was her father after Prosecutor Dancer aggressively questions her on the stand thinking she was his mistress. That was a great scene.There are no surprises here. No big twist of a revelation. We see everything played out. It's almost like a docu-drama, and it's really good in that sense. .This was excellently acted. My favorite character was the judge. I think people that want a realistic courtroom drama would really love this. I gave it an 8/10",

The lawyering is based on jurisprudence, not the imagination of a Hollywood script writer. The dialogue and subject matter was way ahead of it's time and addresses very adult issues. Jimmy Stewart is terrific playing the very nuanced and clever attorney-one of his best performances. George C. Scott is compelling as the tenacious and highly capable guest prosecutor. Otto Preminger directs a very intriguing true story adaptation that never drags. You find yourself leaning forward to listen as one might in a real courtroom. Ben Gazzara , the accused, and Lee Remick, his fun-loving wife, are anything but a typical couple. And what an incredible supporting cast of characters Preminger has assembled: Arthur O'Connell, Eve Arden, Orson Bean, 'Naked City' Ken Lynch, John Wayne fav John Qualen, 'Jaws' Murray Hamilton, 'Floyd the Barber' Howard McNear, 'Helloooo Mr. Wilson ' Joseph Kearns and, as the Judge, the actual defense counsel from the Army-McCarthy hearings Joseph N. Welch, who uttered the famous line: \"At long last, Sir, have you left no sense of decency?\"",

            "content": "There is back story galore and glamorously presented to the tunes and strains and riffs of Duke Ellington, who did the musical score along with Billy Strayhorn. Jimmy Stewart is fine once again as the 'aw, shucks, I'm just a humble country boy', Paul Biegler, who, after failing to win re-election as district attorney, feels dissed by his community and spends most of his time fishing and playing jazz piano while hanging out with his boozing friend and one time mentor, Parnell McCarthy, comically played by Arthur O'Connell. Eve Arden does a variation of her 'Our Miss Brooks' persona as Biegler's secretary, Maida Rutledge, and get her quips and digs in at all the right moments, too. Lee Remick plays the rape victim Laura Manion, whose psychological disposition and motives get examined inside out in the narrative and the court room. Finally, you have the admitted murderer himself, Frederick Manion, played by Ben Gazzara, using a cigarette holder for his cigarettes, and calculating with Biegler how to make the legal precedent of irresistible impulse work well enough to enable him to cop of plea of not guilty.There is here this sordid tale of rape and murder, both told at a leisurely pace and in a hotch-scotching sort of meandering and skipping away, giving everybody plenty of time to consider who's guilty and who's innocent and for what and how much. Nothing seems to be entirely black and white here in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and moral ambiguity writhes it's way in and out of the narrative between the scales of justice with the loose footed virtuosity of a tap dancer on broken glass. George C. Scott is a stand out as Claude Dancer, assistant to the District Attorney Mitch Lodwick as played by Brooks West. Dancer's logical assessment of the merits of the defendant's claim of 'irresistible impulse' is as brilliant as his understanding of feminine motivation is faulty.When you see Biegler and Dancer go mano a mano with a little tag team assistance from Lodwick on the side of the prosecution, be advised the fireworks have begun. Each is building a case for conviction or acquittal by asserting those points of truth that help their cause while ignoring or downplaying those points that might invalidate it or at least hold it up to question. The beauty of Otto Preminger's direction and Wendell Mayes' screenplay is that the story has a surefooted elegance to it that suggests there might be a larger truth beyond the mere consideration of who is right or who is wrong, who is innocent and who is guilty. The scene where Laura Manion retraces for Paul Biegler the trail that leads to the scene of the crime and her sexual victimization is a human revelation that makes her appear more emotionally naked than at any time during the incident.We find out a lot about the alleged rapist Bernard \"Barney\" Quill, from the eye witness accounts of a cast of colorful characters. Each of them have seen a side of Quill that they fear, hate or, as in the case of Kathryn Grant playing Mary Pilant, admire and love. The viewer is invited to form a picture of what he was like in their own imaginations without any reliance on flashbacks. The closest we come to an actual physical representation of Quill is through the few pictures of him taken at the coroner's office. The other thing that is remarkable is how many experts take the stand sharing their learned opinion about the crime, sometimes shedding light and sometimes not at all.Meanwhile, we have those wonderful images of Biegler sharing hot licks on the piano with Duke Ellington playing Pie Eye and Danny the Dog turning on a flashlight as Laura Manion's pet Muff. We also get to see Biegler's alchoholic colleague Parnell Emmett doing a little scouting around while on the wagon behind the wheel of a borrowed automobile without a driver's license. George C. Scott as Dancer gets to scare the bejesus out of Laura Manion and everyone else with those killer eyes before reaching for his cape to draw back into a night that is not there, and Frederick Manion comes to regret speaking a little too freely to his cell mates when he is at last on trial for his life. Joseph N. Welch, one of the justices who berated Joe McCarthy for having no shame, makes a memorable performance out of his bored and bemused Judge Weaver, as we are left at the end to wonder whether or not the Manions really did get away with something after being inspired by the witness coaching of their legal counsel. Still, it appears that the scales of justice have an irresistible impulse to balance in spite of everything that has to do with human frailty.",

            "content": "James Stewart plays a lawyer trying to build a defense for a man who's committed a murder. The details of the crime remain fuzzy, and as a viewer you're never quite sure which way the verdict will swing.The film seems to capture the whole trial experience, from preparing a case to swearing in the jurors to cross-examining witnesses to objecting to lines of questioning to meeting informally in the judge's chambers, etc. Neither side is the \"bad guy\", they're just doing their best to play the game and outsmart each other. It's about strategy. (After jurors are asked to disregard Stewart's objectionable questioning, the defendant asks Stewart how people can just forget something they've already heard. \"They can't,\" he replies.)The movie isn't a typical melodramatic courtroom spectacle; it manages to carry a more enjoyable light-hearted air, with some bits of humor. The acting is good and the characters are unique. Jimmy Stewart's easygoing lawyer character is a fisherman and a jazz enthusiast. The judge is even-tempered and personable and loves the legal process. Lee Remick plays a wife who doesn't like being tied down. George C. Scott plays a cunning big city lawyer brought in to assist the D.A. Eve Arden (Principal McGee from \"Grease\") plays Stewart's secretary. The music (where it appears) is done by the great Duke Ellington, who also cameos as a jazz pianist.Made in 1959, the film surprised me with some of its content. Talk of sexual matters, casual treatment of rape (a main plot point) and some PG-13 words. I'm curious how this film would've been rated back in the day.At 2 hours and 40 minutes, this film might be longer than you're willing to spend watching a trial unfold, so keep that in mind. But it's not your typical legal drama, and has a certain character all its own.",

Every scene and line pointed to a good build up that should have led to an amazing crescendo in the climax. As is usually warranted in a courtroom drama. Except that it quite didn't deliver on that payoff. I won't go into spoilers but it's actually baffling that they gave away a major reveal quite early on in the film. They had clearly set it up till that point of the reveal for it to work effectively for the audience. They could have easily continued suppressing that reveal, letting the audience work with a red herring in the meantime, until they could have just let it loose in the final courtroom scene. It would have been quite satisfying as a sort of twist. Likewise, there were some other instances where I felt there could have been a better progression of the story and the way certain new characters are introduced.People might think I am nitpicking too much except that this minor carping only serves to explain why I am giving it a solid 8 instead of a rock hard 10/10",

Then, the defense team digs through previous cases until they find a precedent of \"irresistabe impulse,\" and that was about a century old!

Now we might see the very rape that precipitates the murder of Barney Quill by Remick's shady soldier husband, Ben Gazzara.Three elements raise this above many other films about crime, the law, and the justice system.One is the story itself. Let's face facts, he said. What's the usual trajectory in courtroom dramas? An innocent man or woman is framed or otherwise unjustly tried for a crime and the defense counsel comes to his or her aid and, only at the last minute, after much tribulation, saves the innocent from conviction.Or, conversely, the murderer is about to go free but only at the last minute is exposed through the heroic efforts of the tormented and self-sacrificing prosecutor. The guilty party may break down on the stand, pounding his fists against his temples, shrieking, \"Okay, I did it. I DID IT! But I only wanted to scare her.\" There is no such clear opposition between good and bad in this case. Barney Quill probably did rape Gazarra's wife, but we can't be sure, what with her hanging around Barney's bar while Gazarra is home asleep, nudging Quill with her rear end, belting down shots. And Gazarra may in fact have been in a state of dissociation when he pulled the trigger on Barney but Gazarra gives us ample reason to believe he's lying about his mental condition during the incident.It's a grown-up look at guilt and the justice system, lacking in cartoon characters.Another feature that raises this film above most other examples of the genre is the acting. The performances by all the principles are exemplary. George C. Scott in an early role is almost perfect, in the way that a Smithfield ham can be perfect.Finally, this story is set in Thunder Bay on the upper peninsula of Michigan. These are northern latitudes we're talking about. Even in early Fall the nights are chilly. The trees look as if they're shuddering with revulsion at the notion that another winter is around the corner. The streets and mostly vacant holiday spots look bleak. Townspeople talk about the bears being harmless as they rummage through the garbage for scraps. You can see the northern lights in the middle of July. The local color is precisely pinned down.There are several comic exchanges too. It's about rape, beatings, and a revenge murder, but it's not a heavy drama. Arthur O'Connell is worth a few smiles as an elderly Irish lawyer friend of James Stewart's, trying to stay off the bottle and burping his way through the trial. Eve Arden adds some welcome wise cracks and some trenchant and funny observations.Two slight turn offs. One is Saul Bass's razzle-dazzle titles. Sometimes that man's ego tripped him up. There should have been a credit: SAUL BASS PRESENTS SPECTACULAR TITLES. And then there's the musical score. I love some of Duke Ellington's work but this is not among his best efforts and it would have worked better as source music. That is, it could easily have added to the atmosphere of Barney Quill's bar if the Duke's music had been played on the juke box.Overall, a superior job. Better than John D. Voelker's novel, which badly needed a perceptive and ruthless copy editor.",

If Jimmy Stuart's lawyer believes his client is guilty should we be rooting for him \u0096 or for the cocky prosecutor, a serpentine Scott, who aims to convict him? Is the soldier a cold-blooded killer? Did the bartender rape the soldier's wife at all?

Three main factors are responsible for this sudden upsurge of interest. When it comes to legal tactics and counsel by- play, the author, Judge John D. Voelker of the Michigan Supreme Court, knows what he is talking about. The second factor is the entrance of George C. Scott as opposing counsel and real-life lawyer, Joseph N. Welch, as the judge.

You've got a case of supposed rape, a trailer-thrash slut of a wife, and a dark suave husband who couldn't be trusted. The wife, \"raped and bruised\" by a bartender she fooled around with, the jealous husband kills him in rage, and a naive lawyer takes upon his defense. The film doesn't keep you guessing too much - do not expect twists and turns. The pleasure is elsewhere. The music by Duke Ellington adds greatly to it; you will even see him appearing. And I just loved a final line (remember, \"gentlemen drink gin\"): \"I knew there was something wrong with that guy. I've never met a gin drinker yet you could trust!\". 10 out of 10.",

            "content": "\"Anatomy of a Murder\" is a film that combines a tightly woven story, marvelously ingratiating characters, a great score, a well-paced narrative, the most coherent work of one of the more interesting (and eccentric) directors, and one of America's greatest film actors at the peak of his powers? What can you say when such a film loses several Oscars to -- God forbid -- \"Ben Hur\"?Simply said, \"Anatomy of a Murder\" is one of the greatest films of the 1950s. Even if you're not a fan of legal procedurals, there's something about this film that draws you in -- most likely because it is a film about the behavior of people who happen to be lawyers (and other court folk), rather than a film about talking heads with the title of \"lawyer.\" Wendell Mayes' screenplay takes the source novel, and fleshes out the characters to a point where you can trace the motives of the characters from their behavior, not from convenient dialogue. Indeed, the one true instance of character exposition -- Stewart's speech to the woman who may have been the victim's mistress --is less a matter of tacked-on exposition than a calculated strategy by Stewart's character to provoke a response. In doing so, Stewart creates one of the warmest, and best, monologues of the film.Likewise, director Otto Preminger fought fiercely to maintain the context of the novel by refusing to compromise on key elements of the underlying rape (or simply overeager coupling, depending on who you believe. Preminger's efforts are less a case of trying to keep scandalous (for the time) material in the film than insisting that key flashpoints for character motivation be maintained. Equally, Duke Ellington's noirish jazz score (as well as his cameo) lend texture and gravity to the proceedings.And then, there is Stewart's performance. Many prefer his work in \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (a performance I've always found too naive to fully enjoy) or \"It's a Wonderful Life\", or in the Anthony Mann westerns. For me, however, this performance combines the marvelous boyish sincerity of Mr. Smith, the world-weariness of his western characters, the moral ambiguity of Scottie Ferguson (\"Vertigo\"), the wit of his Margaret Sullavan comedies (\"The Shop Around the Corner\"), and the uncertainty under stress of George Bailey -- in other words, a career of experience and characters all brought to bear. The result is one of most superb performances of the 1950s (or, for that matter, the 1960s). Stewart would never again have another role like this -- and it's almost as if he knows it.Not that Stewart's performance is an isolated occurrence -- every supporting performance is as near perfect as can be: Arthur O'Connell's insouciant partner; Eve Arden giving Thelma Ritter a run for her money as the loyal (and wisecracking) secretary; Murray Hamilton as a biased, but deeply human witness for the prosecution; Ben Gazzara's cipher of a defendant; Lee Remick's sultry (possible) victim; George C. Scott's brilliant legal fencer; and, perhaps most joyously, real lawyer Joseph Welch as the folksy judge -- laid back, but always in control.In other words, a film that should not be missed.",

This guy was portrayed as being virtually incapable of doing anything right.  I didn't buy that; if he were so inept, why would he ever have been hired in the first place?  Good grief, your average debate team member from a high school could handle himself better than _that_.  Otherwise, though, the cast was fabulous; I wanted to know them all better.  The only other character who gave me any cause to grumble was George C. Scott's, who was generally wonderfully snaky, but when he became practically terrified of what to do with a little dog when it jumped up on his lap, I had to say, now come on guys... just because he's the emotional/dramatic \"villain\" character here, that doesn't make him inhuman.  It's hard to believe that bit was based on reality; it felt extremely Hollywood, and clashed badly with the rest of the film, which really drew me in.As far as the plot goes, I ended up being terribly confused as to what had actually happened in the original situation.  The trial resolved nothing for me, really.  At first that irritated me, but now I wonder if that was the intent of the author/director all along.  If so, I suppose it was brilliantly executed.  ;-)8/10 for me, despite the fascinatingly anachronistic hubbub over the word \"panties\".",

Neither of these three principals is exactly chopped liver and there is strong support - by Eve Arden especially - in the shape of George C. Scott, Murray Hamilton, Arthur O'Connell and John Qualen.

The story line puts the \"Order\" part of any Law & Order episode to shame, and the open ended ending is just perfect. This is one of those films to pop in when you have guests under age 35 in the house.What is so different from most courtroom dramas is the lack of empathy between lawyer Stewart and defendant Gazzara, and it's meant to be that way.After meeting the Army officer, and his loose wife Remick, the viewer will be rooting for the prosecution, and hoping Stewart drops this loser and gets back to fishing, but when Scott appears on the scene, the scales of justice for the watcher begin to shift back to the defense, not because we believe Gazzara is innocent, but because we want to see the Hot Dog Scott slip on a banana peel. When he does, we eat it up, but now we hope for a hung jury and a retrial that we don't have to watch.Lawyer Welch, who rose to fame in the Army-McCarthy hearings, is so different in his role than the actors we are accustomed to see playing the men or women in the robes. Most overact and put on extra salt, but Welch seems to be almost reciting his words.

            "review_title": "our morally ambiguous universe",
            "content": "Preminger's Anatomy of a Murder is a masterclass in moral ambiguity, disturbing on its release in 1959 and still arguably ahead of its time half-a-century later.James Stewart is Paul Biegler, a former DA ousted from office who has switched to cruise control, preferring fishing and music to garnering clients and solving cases. The removal from office may not, we suspect, have been totally unwarranted. His mentor/sidekick is Parnie McCarthy (Arthur O'Connell), an unrepentant lush who was also eminent at the bar in his day, and serves warnings both implicit and explicit to Biegler about the path he is now travelling. The shot at redemption arrives in the form of the Manion case, a decorated war hero accused of murdering the man who raped his wife.Except redemption seems a peripheral concern in the moral quagmire that the Manions inhabit. Fred Manion, a testosterone-fuelled Ben Gazzara, has no regrets about emptying a chamber of bullets into his victim. Laura Manion bears the physical scars of her ordeal (that may or may not have been at the hands of the gunned-down bar owner), but behaviorally in no way appears the rape victim, drinking and dancing in juke joints with her incarcerated husband's colleagues, and flirting overtly with his lawyer. The husband's plea of temporary insanity is doubtful, but Lee Remick's performance suggests that one member of this couple at least is genuinely mentally unstable.Mrs. Manion is a flirt and man-eater, but also, possibly, a rape victim. Her husband is a wife-beater and brawler, but also, possibly, a man driven out of his wits. The murder victim may have been a rapist, but he had a child that he cared for, a former lover in Canada that he stood by, and was respected as an employer. And Biegler is charismatic and adroit in defending his client, but blithely unconcerned with getting at the 'truth.' He high-handedly refuses Parnie's suggestion that he coach his client in his insanity plea, but through Socratic contortions leads him there anyway.At the end, Parnie is on the wagon, the law practice is on the up again, and the client couple disappear, to no great show of concern from Biegler. The law seems to have been manipulated rather than served, and no greater cause has been advanced. Take away Duke Ellington's score, the screwball banter with the secretary, the naive incompetence of the prosecutor, and Parnie's hammy lush moments and you are left with a very dark shade of film noir.The film earns every second of its expansive 160-minute run-time, layering in the complexity. There are no red herrings, because there is no absolute truth to work in counterpoint. A rosary set is introduced at first to show sincerity, and then revealed to be possibly a tool of deception. The acting is superb, Stewart effortlessly charismatic up against Gazzara's jagged, flawed masculinity. Remick hold the attention more than most, either ditsy or deeply disturbed. Stewart perhaps employs a tad too much frivolity in his attempts to cope with her overt sexuality, but in the character of Mrs. Manion the film blazes a path that would eventually see Jodie Foster gain an Oscar for her portrayal of the \"morally questionable\" Sarah Tobias in The Accused almost thirty years later.The film's thematic concern is the essence of justice, and whether such high concepts are truly served by our degraded legal systems that claim to conjure up such notions. Arguments presented in black-and-white terms are represented as unrelentingly grey, and it is that achievement that makes this movie timeless.",

This film did a wonderful job of showing the moral ambiguities that were beginning to plaque our country. Was the defendant truely a victim of \"temporary insanity?\" (I'm not giving away much, here...this issue becomes obvious within ten minutes into the film.) What about the defendant's wife, played so wonderfully by a voluptuous Lee Remick?  What was truly motivating her?  We see a small town in upper Michigan in the grips between a seeming moral grayness, and the tried-and-true beliefs of the previous generation.  If you wonder how we got to where we are today, this films captures with clarity the open volleys of the changes that still reverberate through our culture, today. Otto Preminger directs tightly, allowing the story line itself reveal the motivations and struggles of its characters.  All this, plus a dandy taste of the \"new jazz\" that was sweeping the country, as performed by Duke Ellington. We might consider this, today, to be a \"period piece.\"  Yet it vibrates with energy, tautness and great acting; its worth seeing again, if you haven't for a number of years!",

            "review_title": "Self-Indulgent and Unsatisfying",
            "content": "Well, let's make this review as courtroom drama itself and begin with the opening remarks. Ladies and gentlemen, this film claims to be a courtroom classic, but in fact it's an episode of PERRY MASON! Oh, I don't mean that it rips off any particular episode, but it does have the flavor of such. Let me present some evidence. Exhibit A: the lawyer of humble means who wins his case mostly on the shock of producing a surprise witness. It is obvious not only to me, but to Biegler also (notice he tells his partner that he's \"making a lot of noise but Dancer's scoring all the points\"), that the defense's chances are pretty bad. To the rescue comes Kathryn Grant as Mary Pilant. Amazingly, she is Barney Quill's daughter. Amazingly, McCarthy uncovers this dirt by applying himself to one odd detail. Dramatically, but to no plot use, McCarthy almost dies bringing home this news. Amazingly, Pilant is of such a pure heart that she even offers the key piece of evidence, this despite the fact that her father was very kind to her. Sorry, but being a good citizen hardly seems motive enough to destroy the memory of your own blood and the reputation of your own name in a small town. And so, Biegler \"wins\" the case not on tenacity, not even on craftiness, but only because Dancer accuses Pilant of being Quill's lover, not knowing she is Quill's daughter. It stretches my imagination too far to believe that an experienced attorney such as Dancer would blow his cool on a witness, and a piece of evidence, as extraneous as this. After all, panties STILL don't prove that Lt. Manion was temporarily insane, only that the rape did in fact MOST LIKELY occur. Exhibit B: Eve Arden as the tart and worldly Maida Rutledge. Can you say \"Della Reese?\" Exhibit C: Preminger's long camera looks come off more like TV cinematography than anything approaching Hitchcock's direction. Thunder Bay never looked more drab. The references to fishing are thrown in seemingly as an afterthought, perhaps to give us a clue what Thunder Bay is, or to make Biegler's retirement seem more real, or to create a diversion. Between the cheesy bar and the trailer park, I thought I was in Arkansas. The courtroom camera-work was especially boring, even if crisp enough. In summation, it will not be hard for a jury to see these same glaring deficiencies and similarities to television's fabled attorney. On a different note, I was also displeased with the number of red herrings thrown in. First, let's look at the character of Alphonse Pacquette. Is there some reason that he should be hostile? Yes, he is upset that he knows Quill is a rapist, but not because of his sensitivity. Oh no, we can see that he is more than typically-male. It's because he cares for Pilant, perhaps is in love with her, and doesn't want to see her hurt. He also doesn't want to be the one to blow the whistle on her father. So what happens? SHE blows the whistle! Now what? Is Pacquette some kind of hero? Absolutely not! He is still just a dud, a liar on the stand, a wolf. And yet Preminger makes us believe that perhaps Pilant cares for Pacquette also. True, the attraction between man and woman is a mystery, but this magnetism between the stately (!) class of Pilant and the dirt-cowardice of Pacquette is too much to bear. Second, the frog lure which Stewart gives to the judge. What is the significance? Is it a bribe? Is it a tactic? Is it a situation comedy? Third, the relationship between the Manions. Is she a slut? Is he a jealous nut? Does he beat her? Apparently, it's not that important to anybody (not even the jury) that Lt. Manion slaps his wife, beats on flirtatious men, gets into fights etc. Fourth, Lee Remick's character. For somebody who has been raped, she is surprisingly frank, forthright, and detailed. Nobody seems surprised at her unbroken softness. The red herring here is, perhaps MRS. Manion killed Quill! And even in this, she is too easy a mark. Too flirtatious, too easy-going, too boozy. Partying soon after, probably at the same bar that Quill owned. Small-town-attitude, my eye! No detectives follow her, no evidence is brought to show that she is still just wild with the fellas. The Asst Atty General is bright enough to take over the case, but has no instinct whatsoever to tail Mrs. Manion? Ha! I myself was more interested in the mystery surrounding the case. Was Lee Remick raped? Why then is she so jolly? Why can't Ben Gazzara have more range than two emotions: anger and despondency? Why is Jimmy Stewart broke? Why is Duke Ellington in Thunder Bay? This brings me to another point: I thought the film was very self-indulgent. Stewart playing the piano incessantly, and especially at the club with Pie-Eye. Whoop-de-doo, my hero. Lee Remick flaunting polyester suits for no particular reason. Lee, I get it... you have a nice figure. Talk about raising interest for your next film! Even the score was self-indulgent, even self-conscious. It was more like a score for an Ed Wood film-- out of place! Finally (thank the Lord I'm almost finished), the ending. Are we to be satisfied with such a swift decision by the jury? I know, I know-- the verdict is not as important as the courtroom cat-and-mouse game. Sorry, I don't buy that sorry excuse. And the epilogue? Yes, roll your eyes, and what a surprise: the Manions have moved along in their trailer without paying Stewart. Uh.... doesn't Manion have to stand military trial as well? Isn't he IN the military? And don't Stewart and McConnell look the happy pair for having been swindled of their hard-earned cash? Ooh, and we're gonna administer an estate. Ooh, big bucks. Yeah, right.",

There is a reason why even court TV condenses the court coverage to short snippets, courtrooms are generally very boring, and overcome by process and rules.

            "content": "I have been duped into watching this twice, having forgotten its plot from the first viewing, seeing the incredibly high rating on IMDB and viewing it again. Even during my second viewing, before recollection hit, I expected something genius, satisfying and powerful like Witness for the Prosecution. What I got was of course a drama too ambitious for its current capabilities that feels sometimes cheap and sometimes offensive.It should not be too much to expect a courtroom drama to be able to put together a coherent opening and closing statement. However, neither the defense or the prosecution are able to summarize their arguments in the beginning or the end. The beginning is especially important, as it leaves us guessing as to why the prosecution is hellbent on hiding the rape, and leads to more than one loud outbursts from James Stewart. At some point you think it is all done to build up to some great reveal or genuis law trick but its not. It just sort of fizzles every now then in a row between the benches. Coherence is really the main flaw of this not-so-little drama. It is never certain if the point of contention is whether the rape really happened or whether they seriously want to consider if Remick was too drunk and sleazy to even be 'rapeable'. This is now offensive territory. It was sort of unnerving watching a whole room of ADULT men and women snickering when the judge refers to the 'panties' of the raped woman, and the judge chastisizing them because the panties are connected to the fate of two MEN. Not unlike this scene, the whole movie lacks a noble ambition, a moral highground, a sense of comfort if not in the system then in the judgement of the protagonist. James Stewart's role in this movie of an attorney who quite blatantly doesn't care about setting a guilty man free feels like a betrayal of sorts. And this is not in appearance an artsy film that is meant to convey cynicism or bare-bones chaos. It is shot as a well put together, serious drama that has a brilliant story to tell. The story is not so brilliant however. The same dead horse is beaten for a good 160 minutes. Gazzara is vaguely a violent man. Remick is definitely a tempting woman. The victim's honor has to be defended fiercely by the prosecution for some reason, and they fail to see that he was the other half of that bingo date. At some point it feels like they could not possibly be going on about if for so long without making a point about the injustice of justifying rape, but no, the raped wife says she will be happy to have her arse kicked to kingdom come by her husband once he gets off. I mean why make me sit through scene after scene of undermining Remick for that line? Maybe housewives in the 50's loved every minute of the then saucy drama, but I would rather sit through almost three hours of an actual class on anatomy. It would both be more enjoyable and useful.Some antiquated films are still indispensible cinema to this day. Others are just mediocre. All that's black and white isn't gold.",

That is a huge legal no-no. The error is compounded when Scott, the prosecutor, asks the witness, played by Grant, a simple question, that Scott should have already known. It was supposed to be a courtroom shocker, buy it wasn't because we the audience already were aware of the answer several scenes earlier.

Those who pick this movie apart probably are not classic movie lovers and should probably stick to the newer movies.

James Stewart is flawless as always, and his performance in this film is as stellar as any of his others. The supporting cast also performs well, and the film is well-directed. However, the film has become outdated. In it's time, this film was provocative due to its language and subject matter. Today, without that punch of something exciting, the film is just that: not exciting. In other words, the meat of the film does not hold up without the spice produced by the film's aura in its day and age. The word \"panties\" just isn't jaw-dropping any longer.The dated nature of this film is extremely evident in the scenes inside the court room (which comprises the body of the film for the most part). While these scenes might have been acceptable in their time, after all the other films involving court rooms and lawyer-banter, these scenes are long, drawn-out, and furthermore they're flat out ridiculous at times (especially the numerous objections that, while serving their purpose, bog down the story's pace significantly rather than producing an ebb-and-flow into prevalent information).All-in-all this is by no means a bad film. However it is not a timeless film. The story has become worn territory, and for the modern viewer, its just falls flat, feeling more like someone telling a long winded story rather than presenting a film from which the viewer may draw their own conclusions.I applaud Otto Preminger's effort to push the envelope. However, it has been pushed much farther since 1959, and if one strips away the racy elements of the film and takes it out of the time-frame in which it was made, the pacing and monotony of the film make it merely average.",

Of the two, this one is more believable with strong performances all around with special mention to George C. Scott.Preminger was second only to Billy Wilder as far as turning out masterpieces in the 1950's. Interesting, this same year Wilder also made a court drama in which a guilty man was successfully acquitted through strong efforts by the counselor to that counselor's dissatisfaction of the outcome. That film was Witness for the Prosecution that starred former Stewart's co-star Marlene Dietrich.I would have loved seeing Eve Arden better showcased but Lee Remick did just fine as the female lead. The screenplay was strong and nothing said in the court room hit a false note. And it's great to see Joseph Welch, who helped bring down Joseph McCarthy, a judge. James Stewart must have been open minded in helming this; it's been noted that he was a staunch Republican and made general in the arm forces.I'm also a big fan of Duke Ellington and it's a pity he didn't score more pictures. The movie reveals that Stewart himself was a pianist, playing some Ellington like tunes while waiting for a verdict. Preminger was wise though, that no music was played during the long courtroom scenes. I had the most fun seeing Scott and Stewart verbally sparring with each other.Kudos all around.",

            "content": "Anatomy Of A Murder (1959) :\nMovie Review -The Most Humourous Courtroom Drama Ever but missed the essential pointers. The 2 Classic Courtroom Dramas i can never forget are \"Witness For The Prosecution\" and \"Judgement At Nuremberg\" which actually released around same time close to Anatomy Of A Murder hence the direct comparison is reasonable and acceptable. Even though the stories are completely different and the motives are not at all crossing each other the genre factor makes these comparison enough affordable. Anatomy Of A Murder has a long runtime of 160 minutes which is a rare thing for any Courtroom drama i remember, but still the humourous structure and gripping storytelling never let it feel bored. James Stewart in sublime form is a treat to watch especially in arguments and statements segments. Lee Remick as Laura looks gorgeous and comes out as a complete surprise package in acting terms. Rest of the cast is fine but nothing much to be remembered. Now coming to the shortcomings which i feel many movie fans missed about this film and i i feel i must at least try from side and leave it for the readers to understand if it really makes sense. The essential pointers of the films have been sidelined due to the involvement of that Rape thing. As we all know, in every courtroom drama the last 2-3 points from the attorneys are always bang on which makes their stands clear and we get the idea which side will win at the end (we already know protagonist always win) but here the last arguments are weakest of all arguments. Why so? Because they focuse on Rape and not on Insanity which is the main case and also defence's actual Target. The side characters aren't used for any important scenes, neither they even look like trying something on thier own. Otto Preminger makes a gripping tale but not conceptually right. Overall, A Great Fun but not a ClassicRATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "content": "ANATOMY OF A MURDER raises prickly and complex questions about legal ethics, while challenging the audience to decide for itself the tricky issues of justice and truth. There are no clear-cut good guys and bad guys, and the film's resolution has an ironic edge. ANATOMY OF A MURDER is a movie based on the best-selling book by Michigan Supreme Court justice John D. Voelker, who served as technical adviser on the film and was the defense attorney on the real-life case on which his novel was based. The murder occurred in a small town in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan on July 31, 1952. The client never paid the attorney his fee, so he wrote this story to make up for it. ANATOMY OF A MURDER stars James Stewart as a seat-of-the-pants Michigan lawyer. Through the intervention of his alcoholic mentor, played by Arthur O'Connell, he accepts the case of one army Lieutenant played by Ben Gazzara in only his second film, an unlovable lout with a sexy wife played by Lee Remick. Faced with the formidable opposition of big-city prosecutor George C. Scott (starring in his first film), Stewart hopes to win freedom for his client. Also featured in the cast is Eve Arden as Stewart's know-it-all secretary and Katherine Grant as the young woman who may benefit from the murder. ANATOMY OF A MURDER may seem like it has the perfect cast -- once you've seen it, but originally they tried to get Gregory Peck as the lawyer, Lana Turner as the wife, and Richard Widmark as the jealous husband. In his autobiography, Preminger stated that he wanted Spencer Tracy or Burl Ives for the role of \"Judge Weaver.\" But Tracy turned it down as too small a part. Burl Ives also passed on the offer but then someone, came up with a great suggestion - why not use a real judge? The director soon found the perfect 'actor' to play the ever-patient judge. Joseph Welch, the lawyer who helped to bring down Senator Joseph McCarthy's witch hunt by asking him on national television, \"Have you no sense of decency?\" ANATOMY OF A MURDER was filmed on location in two small towns in the upper-peninsula of Michigan. The courtroom, jail and hospital scenes were shot in their actual counterparts. Stewart's office in the film was Voelker's actual law office. Preminger liked the unique effect the real locations had on the actors causing them to give even more authentic performances. Intercourse. Contraceptive. Sperm. Sex. Climax. Panties. These were not the sort of words movie theatre audiences were used to hearing on the screen in 1959 but director Otto Preminger changed all that with his controversial courtroom drama, Anatomy of a Murder. It was a sure bet that the film's questionable dialogue would not pass through the Production Code office unnoticed but it wouldn't be the first time that Preminger had pushed the envelope with censorship issues in his movies. In 1951 he successfully challenged the Code over using the word 'virgin' in The Moon is Blue, and in 1955, he overcame opposition to his depiction of heroin addiction in The Man With The Golden Arm. The more serious and compelling aspects of Anatomy of a Murder were overshadowed by the publicity surrounding the production which played up the more unsavory aspects of the rape/murder trial and sensationalized them. Stewart's father, a hardware store owner back in the small town of Indiana, Pennsylvania even ran in ad in the local paper apologizing for the film and warning folks to stay away from it. And it was even briefly banned in Chicago for using words like, \"contraception.\" Yet, despite the adult subject matter, the film arrived on screens with its dialogue mostly intact and became one of the biggest box office hits of that year. In his autobiography, Preminger wrote, \"Our presence created great excitement in those little towns. The special train carrying cast, crew, and equipment arrived and half the population was at the station to greet us. Duke Ellington arrived a few days after we had begun to shoot. I find it useful to have the composer with me on the set. By watching the progress of the shooting, seeing the dailies....he becomes part of the film.\" The director even cast him in a bit part - as a pianist named 'Pie-Eye,' working at the local roadhouse. The soundtrack marked Ellington's first feature film score. Of all the film's many virtues, Jimmy Stewart's portrayal of attorney Paul Biegler is a key factor in the film's success. According to the actor, he considered it his most challenging role since Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life. \"It was worth all the extra effort,\" Stewart said in one interview, \"I spent a lot of time memorizing my lines for that movie. The picture demanded an awful lot of time and thought. As the defense attorney I knew I had to be glibber than usual. Trial lawyers are neither shy nor inarticulate. I read my script each night until I fell asleep.\" Not surprisingly, Jimmy received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his performance in Anatomy of a Murder. In addition to Stewart, ANATOMY OF A MURDER received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Supporting Actors (Arthur O'Connell and George C. Scott), Screenplay, Film Editing, and Cinematography. The film's unusual trailer opens with a bailiff calling the court to order and announcing that \"there is a new movie coming to this town. All those involved will now be sworn in.\" Preminger then stands up and swears in the principal actors, asking each if they \"swear to have done their job in the picture to the best of their ability.\" When Preminger calls on Voelker, the writer protests that there cannot be a trial without a jury. Preminger then replies, \"the judge and jury sits out there, the millions and millions of people in the theater.\" I hope you find this film GUILTY of belonging on the National Film Registry. --- Thanks.",

The Defense would have been presented with all the evidence and a list of the witnesses--there wouldn't be any \"surprise\" witnesses - although what they had to say might be a surprise.Nor would the D.A. be so unprepared they wouldn't even know the relationship of a witness and the deceased.The legalities of this 1959 courtroom drama shows it's age the most regarding the treatment of the rape victim. It is true that in those times, a woman who alleged rape, was smeared in the courtroom.However, the way they have the rape victim behave is completely unbelievable. Except for an initial case of hysterics, Laura Manion (Lee Remnick), the rape victim, is not in the least perturbed by what has happened to her.In addition to James Stewart, we see quite a few recognizable faces among the minor characters--there's the actor that went on to play Mr. Wilson on Dennis the Menace--and many others.Ben Gazzara, one of the handsomest, as well as talented actor, to ever hit the silver screen, plays Lt. Manion, who is on trial for killing Barney Quill the man his wife says raped her. Another goof is Paul Biegler stating the total price of the defense. There is no way he could know this until he had finished all work in regards to the case and the trial.Nor could a client skip out on paying his attorney, being in the military, he would be easy to trace. We can only hope Paul does get his fee since his sec'y, Maida Rutledge (Eva Arden--playing her exactly the same way she always played Our Miss Brooks), apparently has to purchase her own typewriter for the office! In fact, I would have thought the military would have been handling Lt. Manion's defense, and he might be in danger of being court-martialed, but amazingly except for an Army psychiatrist, the military is not involved at all.And while Laura Manion might think Paul Biegler was \"interested\" in her, his character gives no indication of being interested in any woman, and states he loves an old drunk attorney named Parnell (Arthur O'Connell). Old films often had such scenarios which could be \"read into\" if one wished.",

Stewart probably gives the best performance of his career, almost against type. I can't remember many films when Stewart lost his temper as he does in the courtroom in this film (OK he did lose his temper in \"It's a Wonderful Life\").However, Scott's cheesy courtroom tactics (trying to block Lee Remick's view of Stewart), contempt for the defense attorney and semi-controlled fury highlight this film. Scott's final scene where he cross-examines Mary Palante is mesmerizing, as he gets right into her face with his questions. When she divulges her relationship to Barney Quill, the look of shock on Scott's face is almost reason enough to watch this film.I thought Joseph Welch's inclusion was a brilliant bit of casting. I don't mean to make this political however Welch was known as the man who shouted Senator McCarthy down. While McCarthy's tactics may have been reprehensible, he did ferret out Communists who were working in the U.S. government and should not be dismissed completely (Alger Hiss was #2 man in the State Department under FDR and a Communist spy. Richard Nixon was responsible for exposing him).Lastly, I differ from mostly everyone regarding Duke Ellington's score.

The book then became the basis of the script for the movie.It is a gripping story, it held me glued to my TV for the entire length of the film. It combines the suspense of a whodunit with the authenticity of a documentary. The movie was shot entirely on location where the actual murder and trial took place, including the inn and the courtroom.On reflection it is also a most disturbing movie, at least for this foreigner. It ruthlessly exposes the cynicism of the prosecution who from the very start of the investigation was more concerned about winning the case than establishing what truly happened. All the initial investigations that were meant to benefit the DA, the obstruction to admit the aspect of the rape in the trial, the \"hot shot\" from Lansing whose expertise seemed to be character assassination rather than some legal aspect, down to the \"witness\" Miller who makes a sudden appearance at the very end.Luckily the defense is led by a former prosecutor who knows all the tricks in the book (and may have applied them himself in his time). Makes you wonder why the judge was played by Joseph Welch, the national hero who a few years earlier brought down senator Joe McCarthy.Apparently the movie didn't go down well with the public back then and I think that has everything to do with the picture it paints of the practice of a criminal prosecution.

            "review_title": "Still Looking for My Socks (A Lawyer's Perspective . . . )",
            "content": "I had originally intended to title this review, \"A Lawyer Movie for lawyers\", and before writing it I was careful to read a lot of the other reviews to see what the non-lawyers were getting out of it. The first time I saw it I was still a non-lawyer, and also comparatively young, and I remember left feeling it was a bit flat, a fairly standard old black & white melodrama with a courtroom setting with a lot of loud jazz music and typical old-Hollywood histrionics. The main draw for me was simply that it was a courtroom drama, and a \"vintage\" one at that. It did not offer the delightful English character actor performances or cleverly-drawn plot twists of WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION or even the relentless, irresistible, and authoritative hammering of Raymond Burr in PERRY MASON. Moreover, the courtroom antics struck me as decidedly unrealistic, since they conflicted diametrically with my grand total of two days over Spring Break while in junior high school in California of watching what I would eventually learn was the extremely subdued trial presentation of an otherwise fairly sensational murder case.Thus, I was disappointed when some years later I asked a law school professor with a penchant for this kind of thing what the most realistic classic courtroom or lawyer movie was and he came back with this one.The next time I saw this movie I was a either a law student or a very newly-minted lawyer in an insurance defense (i.e., personal injury defense) practice and with the smidgen of professional experience I had acquired by that time could begin to see his point. But it wasn't until I saw this recently, after 29 more years in harness in general practice, that I could really appreciate it for at least part of its true merit.This is very likely the most realistic lawyer movie ever made. Surely there are few others that could begin to compare. It is no exaggeration to say that I did not detect a single instance of anything in this movie that could not plausibly happen in real life, and in fact, there was so much that was so classically typical. \"Juke joints\" and county jail lockups. A basically trashy defendant (however well he might turn out in the uniform of his country, although one thing I have always wondered is why is he only a lieutenant after about nine years in the Army) and his complimentarily hot-to-trot trashy wife (as one venerable judge in our \"family law\" courthouse used to say, \"2's do not marry 7's\"). The wonderful ambiguity inherent in the RV-park where they live in a large-sized Airstreamesque camping trailer. The locally-flashy small-town prosecutor who must have made a better smiling, glad-handing, provincially Clark-Gablesque candidate for District Attorney than Jimmy Stewart's quirky, essentially iconoclastic character, whom he defeats for reelection, even while his amount of actual legal acumen is seriously questionable. The self-impressed, condescending expert-from-out-of-town lawyer who knows perfectly well what he is doing in the courtroom and doesn't make any particular secret of it. The judge was completely believable as a real, utterly competent \"visiting\" judge handling another judge's docket and this particular trial with these particular lawyers in particular (if he had a weakness, it was only the gentleness of his voice, even when he is reading the lawyers a 100% accurate version of a judge's riot act). The unpaid yet staunchly loyal legal assistant, personally invested in the matter up to her armpits (and I'd still like to know how much damage was done to her car and how that was eventually ameliorated). The old lawyer who is basically a decent old fellow but has fallen on hard times and lost a lot of his self-respect (surely every courthouse has at least one of these). And a main character who who looks decidedly abnormal with his fishing (not to mention fly-tying) hobby exaggerated to the level of a personality quirk. He comes complete with a home-based office and a two-or-three-generations-past body-style car that has obviously seen better days (one can easily envision the studio car shop banging a dent in the passenger side door on one side while another crew is changing the driver's side door for an old used one that doesn't really match on the other). About the only thing he lacks is a saggy old hound dog. He is the type of lawyer (at least on this occasion, now that he no longer commands the hammer of the prosecution, but is only a lowly criminal defense lawyer, begging and pleading) who decides to lavish exhibitions of melodramatic emotion on the court with all the usual results that kind of thing will get you if you are foolish enough -- or simply caught up enough -- to try it. Such types do actually occur in nature (or at least, at a courthouse near you).As another reviewer on here (self-identified intriguingly as \"tightspotkilo\") observed in 2005, practically every single act seen and every statement heard in this movie absolutely realistic (or at least 101% plausible). The story was written by a lawyer from the \"upper peninsula\" of Michigan, where it is set, and the director, Otto Preminger, who made a lot of impressive Crap after this, apparently was wise enough in this case to reproduce it just the way it must have been written originally. In the movie's trailer, he appears with the author and they exchange comments to the effect that every single thing that appears in the film was cleared by the lawyer/author first. I believe this because, when I see the film now, it could not possibly be any other way. What I would not give to do the commentary track on a DVD issue. The hardest part of that would be getting all the logical comments in within the run time of the movie.Thus, the repeated comments of non-lawyer reviewers about all the shades of gray and ambiguity in this picture make me laugh out loud. What they seem to laud as a sublimely-inspired, meticulously and no doubt painstakingly-crafted example of the the screenwriter's art is in fact, nothing more than just plain fact. Yea, verily, if this movie is to be offered as any example of the cinematic art, it is in how it makes what could be a documentary into an emotionally-involving drama. Indeed, it is what the better trial counsel almost always try to make happen in a real courtroom. It amounts to a sort of monument to the adage, \"truth is stranger than fiction\".If there is one thing in this piece which makes me cock an eyebrow, it is Jimmy Stewart's reluctance to take this case in the first place. Now, the lawyers in this picture might well have been dead by the time I started practicing law (certainly, actors Stewart and George C. Scott were at very advanced ages by that time). Moreover, Stewart plays a small-town lawyer, which could readily factor into this attitude of his, while my own experience is largely big-city-oriented. In other words, maybe there is a fundamental difference between his circumstances in 1959 and any I have encountered since 1990. That said, in the film Stewart is seen hesitating because he is afraid he can't win the case at trial. In my experience, this is a very unusual thing for a defense lawyer to do. Normally, a defense lawyer has a stack of bills, both occupational and domestic, to pay, and will sign up anything with any money attached to it. The very best and most sought-after might turn down something because they are just too overloaded with other cases to handle it, but that doesn't describe the vast bulk of lawyers. (At the risk of digressing, it is identical to something Humphrey Bogart said in THE MALTESE FALCON in 1940: he told Mary Astor that his detective agency took her case not because they believed her story, but because they believed her $200.) In agreeing to defend somebody, you sign them up first and worry about how to handle the case second.\nIn that regard, you know that the state usually has plenty of good evidence that the vast majority of your clients are as guilty as the year is long, and those clients will wind up pleading guilty in exchange for a known (hopefully) sentence in what is technically known as a plea bargain. In this movie, the \"in\" expression in the upper peninsula of Michigan in 1959 for this kind of thing apparently was \"copping out\"; today, and at least in other places, it is called pleading out, taking a plea, or even taking a deal (just to name the ones I've heard in my particular neck of the United States). While this movie seems to suggest the competitiveness of courtroom lawyers via this device, it isn't really necessary because there is plenty of other material here to show that without it. Maybe the author thought it necessary as exposition, or to enhance the drama. If so, it would be about the only unrealistic bit in the movie. Either that, or maybe that was really the way it was for some lawyer who lost his DA reelection bid in the back woods of Michigan in 1959, and maybe thought he had something to prove.In that vein, from a modern perspective, at least, it is also unusual that he neglects financial matters generally, and in fact doesn't seem concerned about money at all. Most private practitioners I know are always thinking, if not actually worrying about money, because they really don't want to find themselves living in their car (even if it were an early 1950's Chevy convertible; ironically, today that same car in reasonable condition would be worth a years' worth of paychecks to some people). Of course, even us newer older lawyers know that, prior to the 1980's, the legal business environment was much more favorable then than it has been for our generation.What is suggested by all of this, in modern parlance, is a clinically depressed lawyer, and it would seem that an underlying, if overlooked, theme of this movie is that of a defeated man like Stewart's character reclaiming a critical measure of self-respect via this trial experience, a theme accentuated by bein",

            "content": "It's tough to view a movie like Anatomy of a Murder so far outside of its historical context.  Viewed now, the film is a 160 minute episode of a David E. Kelley law drama and since it's about Jimmy Stewart's defense attorney, it's almost impossible not to think of Stewart as the blueprint for Dylan McDermott's Bobby Donnell on The Practice. The plot, about a hotheaded solider (played by Ben Gazzara) charged with murdering the man who may or may not have raped his free-spirit wife (Lee Remick), has been reused a dozen times since then.The key, of course, is just how outrageously ahead of its time Anatomy of a Murder is. Director Otto Preminger devoted a major chunk of his career to tearing down different aspects of the Production Code, breaking taboos on language, drug use, and other mature subject matter. Anatomy of a Murder is shockingly frank in its discussion of the rape and murder. Or at least it was for its time. The fact that Law and Order or LA Law have become more and more graphic, or that movies like Presumed Innocent or The Accused get to rely on explicit flashbacks, shouldn't take anything away the barriers that this film broke.Similarly, it's portrayal of the legal system as an out of control circus was as dark and cynical then as it is old and hackneyed now. While the Judge in the case is beyond reproach legally, the things he lets the attorneys get away with are frequently hilarious.Anatomy of a Murder goes on far too long and the basic arguments are laid out for the audience early on. Everything in the courtroom scene is essentially a restatement, but that gives the audiences a chance to develop the actual case in their mind, rather than the facts. That the facts and the merits of the case aren't entirely joined is one of the film's strengths. That it takes nearly three hours to make the point is a weakness.That Stewart is good is a given. His performance is surprisingly physical, considering the plot and he delivers the humour in Wendell Mays's script perfectly. Still, I can't help but feel that his character is left pretty stagnant as the film goes along. The lack of a journey is important because it makes it clear just how tacked on the character of Parnell McCarthy (played by Arthur O'Connell, who was nominated for an Oscar) is. McCarthy is a cliche essentially, the old drunk lawyer who regains his love for the law, tackles the demons of drink, and comes out the other side. His character isn't really given enough to do, though, to justify his position as the story's sole redemptive element.The other supporting performances are stellar, which Gazzara and Remick as standouts. George C. Scott, as the big city lawyer whose presence is never adequately explained, has several wonderful moments, especially on cross-examinations.The film's legal veracity is tenuous. The first rule of being a trial lawyer is that you never ask a question if you don't know the answer. Both Stewart and Scott seem to be flying by the seats of their pants constantly.\nI saw Anatomy of a Murder as part of a double bill with To Kill A Mockingbird. To some extent, the audience in Murder fills the same role as Scout plays in Mockingbird: Anatomy of a Murder plays like an end to a certain kind of innocence, the conviction that good and evil and right and wrong are always easy to see in the court of law. For me, I prefer Mockingbird's earnestness and its depictions of community. Anatomy, while set in a Northern Michigan town, really doesn't have enough of a sense of place for me.Of course any discussion of Anatomy of a Murder that didn't mention the incredible Duke Ellington score just wouldn't be doing its job. It's an amazing composition. And Ellington appears in the film as well in a brief cameo made all the more amusing if you can recognize him.\nI'd give Anatomy of a Murder an 8/10.  That's probably a little jealous, but it's unquestionably an important film.",

            "content": "There are some truly great courtroom dramas (\"Witness for the Prosecution\" \"The Verdict\" \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"), but I would argue that Otto Preminger's \"Anatomy of the Murder\" is the best cinematic courtroom drama of all time. Jimmy Stewart plays a lawyer in a sleepy resort community in the upper peninsula of Michigan who's hired to defend serviceman Fredrick Manion (Ben Gazarra in his only second film appearance) for gunning down a local bar owner who he believes raped his wife, Laura (Lee Remick in only her fourth film appearance). There's no mystery who did the murder, but the case hinges on whether Gazarra was in his right mind at the time or was in the grips of an \"irresistible impulse\" at the time of the murder. \"Anatomy\" features an amazing cast of young actors. Stewart, Arthur O'Connell, and Eve Arden are veteran Hollywood actors of the group, and besides Gazarra and Remick you also have a young George C. Scott in his second film role and also early roles for Kathryn Grant, Orson Bean, and Murray Hamilton. Perhaps the most interesting casting is of Joseph N. Welch as the trial judge, who's best know as the real-life lead counsel for the Army in the Army-McCarthy hearings where he uttered the famous line \"Have you no sense of decency, sir?\" This was Welch's first and only acting role, but he's terrific. The folks behind the camera are just as impressive. Produced and directed by Hollywood veteran Otto Preminger (\"Man with the Golden Arm\" \"Advise & Consent\" \"Laura\"), Saul Bass (\"Vertigo,\"Ocean's 11\" and \"Goodfellas\") made an ultra cool title sequence, how can you not love the knockout jazz score by Duke Ellington. Ellington even makes a cameo as \"Pie-Eye\" during a dancehall scene. There's a lot that sets \"Anatomy\" apart from other courtroom dramas. I'm no lawyer, but I've read multiple times how this film is one of the more accurate representations of courtroom proceedings, taking it's time to go through pre-trial research, interviews, and investigations, jury selection, and getting into the minutia of nitpicking objections or manipulating juries throughout the trial. It takes its time to show the court proceedings from start to finish and is almost the entirety of the film. That immersiveness is only part of what makes this film such a classic. The verbal sparing between Stewart, who plays himself up as a simple country lawyer to the jury (when he's anything but), tying fishing lures throughout the trial, setting himself up as the little guy going up against big city prosecutors, the most formidable of which is the great George C. Scott. Their back and forth are simply magic to watch. These courtroom scenes make it the kind of film where if your'e flipping channels and happen upon it, there's no way you can turn it off. And the verbal sparing is not limited to the courtroom. The dialogue between characters outside the courtroom is just as riveting, which gets at what the film is really about, how people endlessly play games with one another. There's always something beneath the surface, or an agenda, or even outright lies in just about every interaction. Sometimes it's just playing around with one another, like when Stewart plays coy about what's he has in a brown bag (it's booze) with a colleague, or Remick flirting with Steward in order manipulate him, or the more consequential moments whether Gazarra was gripped by an irresistible impulse or if he was committing pre-meditated murder. This cynical theme of \"don't trust what anyone says or does at face value\" is given emphasis when Stewart's Paul Biegler states, \"As a lawyer, I've had to learn that people aren't just good or just bad. People are many things.\" This is a must see film that everyone should watch at least once.",

The book and the movie really revolve around his working of a court case (the defendant murdered the man who raped his wife) and is not your typical \"Law and Order\" plot but rather a good look at how an attorney builds a case.

The plot twist is predictable and it takes entirely too long too much screen time to get there, the ending is a bit goofy and anti-climactic, and really, other than the client consultation, the judge's chambers scenes and of course the brilliant courtroom battles, most of the movie is hackneyed and forgettable (although in part that might because of how heavily emulated those scenes are by other courtroom dramas).Still, the actual legal drama in this movie is tremendously written and perfectly acted. Not only is it great fun to watch a flamboyant James Stewart engage in deliciously clever verbal battle with an unusually low-key but still brilliant George C. Scott, but it raises interesting ethical questions: Should a defense attorney present a guilty client with his only tactic to be acquitted? Should an attorney provide a flimsy, but technically valid, legal excuse for a jury to find a defendant they really want to find him for social or moral, but not legal, reasons? Altogether, the movie ages well. Fans of the modern courtroom drama will find the legal content of this movie light years ahead of nearly anything that's come out recently. It's not perfect, but it's about as good as the genre gets.",

Paul Biegler (James Stewart) a humble small-town lawyer, is asked to defend him. Biegler originally wants to plead guilty, but soon discovers the idea that they might have a shot for insanity. But this case will not be an easy one. Biegler finds himself up against the State's Deputy Attorney General (George C. Scott), and Biegler must search everywhere for evidence to prove that Laura was raped, and possibly win the case.Anatomy of a Murder was one of the most brilliant courtroom dramas I have ever seen. The story was pretty similar to a lot of movies such as these, but the direction by Otto Preminger was fantastic. Despite the long length of this film, unlike many courtroom dramas Anatomy of a Murder really keeps you interested throughout the entire film. The screenplay was also very good. I laughed out loud several times in the film, and I can tell you there is no better battle then James Stewart and George C. Scott for a courtroom drama.The acting was superb by everyone. I found no one in the film to be a bad actor, and I really loved some of the performances. James Stewart delivered one of the best I have ever seen him. I still believe that It's a Wonderful Life was his career performance, but this was definitely up there in his best. This is one of the only films I have seen with George C. Scott, but he was amazing in this film. The most interesting parts of the film was hearing James Stewart and George C. Scott yell \"objection!\" every single time one of them would say something.Overall, Anatomy of a Murder is probably the greatest, or at least one of the greatest, courtroom dramas I have ever seen. With perfect direction, and great acting by some of the greatest actors ever, this movie quickly became one of my favorites in film history.",

            "content": "I hadn't seen this one in years. ANATOMY holds up pretty well, considering it was shot in B&W and not corrected for sound. Actually, the crisp B&W cinematography and echo-y sound add a sense of realism to the proceedings. The plot: A woman (Remick) cries and her husband (Gazzara) goes on trial for the murder of her alleged rapist. Jimmy Stewart plays Gazzara's lawyer, who quickly smells a rat. For one thing, the woman immediately puts the moves on the lawyer. And the husband cannot remember having actually killed his wife's alleged rapist. Director Otto Preminger, who in some ways can be thought of as the American Hitchcock, employs a jazz score and some racy dialog, including the first use of the word \"rape\" in a Hollywood movie. Remick, who wasn't the first choice for her role, is fabulous as the whore-ish wife. Loosely based on a true story and novel. Worth a look for Stewart fans and old movie buffs. All others, beware. To those under 30, it will look artificial and certainly old-fashioned (Remick makes a remark about her undergarments consisting of bra, panties and slip, but -- gasp! -- no girdle). It is a hoot, considering that a mere five or six years later, young women were burning their bras in the streets and often eschewing even panties. But the film was groundbreaking in its time.",

The most dramatic moment of the movie, involving George C Scott, illustrates that classic \"lawyer's rule\": don't ask a witness a question unless you KNOW the answer already. George's character gets a big surprise when he asks Mary Pilant \"What was Barney Quill to you?\" Interestingly, there was a somewhat different relationship between Mary Pilant and Barney Quill in the book. Also in the book, a key article of clothing does not figure in the same way it does in the movie. All in all, IMO, the movie is better than the book it was based on. All changes were improvements in plot and dramatic effect.Another highlight of this movie is the performance by real-life attorney and judge Joseph N Welch as Judge Weaver. No stranger to drama in real life, Welch was the one who had berated Sen Joseph McCarthy earlier in the 50s with the question \"Have you no sense of decency, sir?\"",

It is a relic from another era that has simply not stood the test of a time.\"Anatomy\" is a courtroom drama concerning the then-taboo topic of rape, in which the jury- and audience- are treated like slow children that could never possibly handle such a \"shocking\" crime. Jimmy Stewart plays the earnest small-town lawyer lead, like Mr. Smith Goes To The Courthouse, a kind of cross between Columbo and Matlock on Valium. His stammering and shuffling add twenty minutes to the movie's running time, and we as the audience are so far ahead of him that he seems pathetic. This is Jimmy Stewart at his most frustrating.Yes, Lee Remick is good as the wife with the itch between her legs and George C. Scott rocks as the sharp and furious prosecuting attorney. But a movie this long and slow cannot be saved by two performances. What we're left with are embarrassing courtroom sequences in which Stewart fights with the Judge to have the victim's panties marked into evidence. The Judge is afraid that even saying the word \"panties\" in front of the jury is indecent, and that the jurors will be so overcome with shock that they might faint on the spot! (Are you starting to see how dated and silly this is?) Forget the fact that the underwear is a key piece of evidence in a murder trial- \"panties\" is a naughty word! And yes, when Jimmy finally says the word to the jury they giggle like nervous schoolchildren. Sigh...You don't have to take my word for it, but please don't say I didn't warn you. \"Anatomy Of A Murder\" is like the first fifteen minutes of a \"Law & Order\" episode stretched out over two and a half hours. Its \"frank\" and \"graphic\" depiction of a rape trial is backwards and downright embarrassing. The story is boring, and the film moves so slowly you'll have plenty of time to ask yourself, \"Why?\"I have no idea.GRADE: D(panties)",

Laura backs up her husband account of what happened, but the police doctor can find any evidence of raped. Lt.

Scott who received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his memorable turn, makes the courtroom battle into a serious dual of legal wits and personalities between the defense attorney and the prosecution. Masterful direction by Preminger, with extraordinary supporting performances by Arthur O' Connell, Eve Arden, Karthryn Grant, Orson Bean, Murray Hamilton, Brooks West, Ken Lynch, John Quelen, and Joseph N.

And then putting the morals of the victim under the microscope.I especially like the lack of black and white in the characters this film offers a greyness, a depth particularly in the victim who is seen as quite monstrous (a \"wolf\") and then as a loving father.We are challenged again and again throughout as our sympathy and investment in the characters gets shaken and we question our very thoughts on what constitutes justifiable homicide, or was it?

            "content": "This is one of Jimmy Stewart's best performances. He plays Paul Beigler, a small-town lawyer who defends a man on a charge that he murdered a man whom his wife accused of having raped her. Stewart leaves his stutter and naively cheerful personality behind to create a believable character who is to be taken seriously, although we wind up knowing very little about him personally. Lee Remick plays Laura Manion, the woman making the rape charge. Laura is more than a bit of a flirt and, even though that is essential to the story, she seems to overplay it. That she should come on to Beigler, a man a generation older and the defense lawyer for her husband, I found incongruous. It is good to see a young George C. Scott turn in an Oscar-nominated performance as one of the prosecuting attorneys. And Joseph N. Welch, who plays the judge, is one of the highlights.There is a subplot concerning Paul and his older lawyer friend Parnell Emmett McCarthy (Arthur O'Connell). Parnell seems to have a lot of regrets about his career and sees Beigler as a representation of what he was before he took some wrong turns, one such being a turn toward drink. But Paul induces Parnell to become involved with the case and Parnell is transformed by being wanted and being able to contribute. I found this little commentary on how important it is to be valued to be moving and true.The movie is long, playing to 160 minutes, but the leisurely pacing is one of its good points. We get to know the personalities of the characters well and get much background information about the case before the extended courtroom battle. The black and white photography is some of the best and well deserving of its Oscar nomination. There are some great nighttime shots with the lighting just perfect. I suppose the detailed discussion of the rape was sensational at the time, but that aspect of the film will be lost on contemporary audiences. I doubt that the thought of this being in any way controversial in the context of being sexually explicit would even occur to a younger audience.Biegler is somewhat accomplished at the piano and it is a treat to see Stewart playing a duet with Duke Ellington in one scene. Ellington contributed the music and, although interesting, it did not always create the right mood for me.I would like to read a review by a lawyer. I know little about the law, but I think even in the 50s the prosecution could not have introduced a surprise witness at the last minute during the trial. And it is not clear at all why the dog was brought into the courtroom.*Spoiler* If I had been on the jury I would have voted guilty, so I found its verdict surprising. However, in movies of the era it was not at all common that the guilty were set free, or the innocent found guilty. The verdict somewhat undercuts Parnell's soliloquy about the beauty of juries, but he did say \"in most instances\" they do it right.",

Anatomy of a Murder is a quite cut-and-dry film with its very basic slow burn presentation of the proceedings. But with the great performances, deep focus photography blended with the jazz score, the blunt approach to some very taboo topics for the time and the hold of the question of morality as to when murder is justifiable keeps you engaged through all its 160 minutes. The way the film talks about rape and murder often feels jarring, but it gives the film a weight that's very admirable. James Stewart is a highlight as always with a performance that's reminiscent to his iconic performance in Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, but what makes his character more interesting is his wise-cracking sense of humour that often goes unappreciated by other characters. It's a great fascinating film although its payoff are quite weak. I prefer Judgment at Nuremberg by a wide margin of course, but it beats Inherit the Wind, To Kill A Mockingbird and Witness for the Prosecution for sure.8/10",

The fast dialogue is simply one of the most captivating I've heard, with the film giving almost no space to breath.\nThe film is very ambiguous never really revealing wether or not the rape actually happened or if Manio beates his wife even though both are implied, we don't even really know if Laura wants the husband to win the trial, Bieler is in on the case because of the challenge and not because of justice so the entire sense of justice is removed from the film, making it more unique and memourable then other films of the genre.\nThe cinematography is great and the score by Duke Ellington is in my opinion among the best and most iconic jazz scores of all time, and the same goes for the title sequence and the poster, but let's be real the vast majority of Saul Bass's work could be considered as among the best and most iconic of all time.\n10/10",

            "content": "Anatomy of an excellent movie:Begin with an extremely tight and well written script, from the novel by the same name. While reportedly the story is based on a real-life case it is nevertheless a timeless story, almost biblical, presenting age-old questions of human conflicts and human dilemmas.Add to that a sensational cast, starting of course with the leads, Jimmy Stewart, George C. Scott, Lee Remick, and Ben Gazarra, but also the rest of the cast, filled as it is with numerous accomplished and veteran stage actors and radio performers from days of yore. Character parts played by actors Arthur O'Connell, Eve Arden, Ken Lynch, Joseph Kearns, and Howard McNear. Someone paid careful attention to the casting for this film.Perhaps the most masterful stroke as far as casting goes was the casting Joseph Welch as the judge. Welch was an experienced and renowned lawyer in real life. Welch turns in a very good and a very believable performance.With the collision of those elements, a great script and a great cast, adding Otto Preminger as director, an overseer who knew exactly what to do with it all, you then have a very fine film.More than any other movie or play, including modern day presentations like the television series Law & Order, this 1959 movie, Anatomy of a Murder, even though it is now 46 years old, is by far the most realistic and technically accurate courtroom drama ever produced. The conduct of the trial, the examination of the witnesses, the colloquy and bantering back and forth between the lawyers and between the lawyers and the judge, is spot-on. Every bit of it. Every question from the lawyers, every objection, every ruling by the judge, every admonishment from the judge, and the testimony of the witnesses, every bit of it, is realistic and believable, lines that were accurately written with care, and then flawlessly delivered.Beyond the technical accuracies of the legal proceedings, some other aspects of the overall story were also spot on. The ambiguous ambivalence of lawyers, their motivations, their ethics, their relative honesty. Nothing is all black or all white. Shades of gray abound. Legal cases as sport. Being a \"good lawyer\" means pushing the envelope too far, bending the rules until you're told to stop. Not for justice. No, not that. To win. That's why. To win. Then sanctimoniously telling themselves that the system really works better this way. The movie accurately captures the fact that real-life legal cases are very often comprised of upside down Alice in Wonderland features. Innocent people are guilty, and guilty people are innocent. Good is bad, and bad is good. Everything is relative. Some call it cynicism. Others, cynically, call it realism. Anatomy of a Murder captures all of these and more.I've read the criticism that Lee Remick was not believable, that as an actress she failed at nailing the portrayal of how a true rape victim would appear and behave, and that her character, Laura Manion, just didn't seem to have the proper affect nor strike the right emotional chord of a woman who had been raped. All I can say is that such criticism misses a humongous part of the point. It is almost mind-boggling that there are viewers out there who, after viewing this film, somehow managed to miss it. Let me clear it up: we the viewers WERE SUPPOSED to have serious doubts about whether Laura Manion had actually been raped. The question of whether she was really raped or not is central to the plot and story line. That's why Lee Remick played the part the way she did. And then, in turn, it was part of the story for the Jimmy Stewart character, Paul Biegler, to recognize this problem, and the problem that it presented to his defense. He worried that the jury would see it and would also doubt that she had been raped, and so that's why he propped her up in court, dressed up all prim and proper, with a hat over her voluptuously cascading hair, and with horned-rim glasses. So, yes, Lee Remick nailed it. Bull's eye.Speaking of Lee Remick, some say that this was the movie that put Lee Remick on the map. She was stunningly beautiful here, at the ripe young age of 24. Even though the film is in black and white, her red hair, blue eyes, and porcelain skin still manage to jump right off the screen and out at you. Has any other actress ever played the role of the beautiful and sexy lady looking to get laid any better than Lee Remick? It was a woman she reprised several times in her career, sometimes with greater subtlety and understatement than others. This was her first rendition of it, and it may have been the best.Anatomy of a Murder is a very complex movie, with multitudes of layers and texturing, where much is deftly explored, but precious little is resolved. It's a movie that leaves you thinking and wondering. I highly recommend it.",

But, how Paul plays with the facts is what to be seen.From starting the movie has those conventional starts, ummm...like u read in detective books...someone comes to the detective with a case, he sits and listens to it. I just very much loved this approach. Gave me a feeling of reading a book. This kind of approach is rare (non-existent) in recent times.Performance wise everyone involved played his part so well that I just can't name any particular individual. Though would like to specially mention James Stewart as Paul and Lee Remick as Laura. I'm already fan of James Stewart from the movies \"Its a wonderful life\" and \"Mr. Smith goes to Washington\" and this one also adds to the list. Stewart just lives in the character in this movie.And, Lee Remick has successfully portrayed the character of a dubious woman. Just watch the movie to understand what I mean.In the end, the movie has given me a very satisfying feeling, it felt complete though incomplete. So many questions are unanswered, stories touched but never concluded....I love the movie even more.",

            "content": "A soldier murders the man who raped his wife. His attorney says his best chance is to claim temporary insanity.We see the movie through the attorney, Paul Biegler's (James Stewart) perspective. We know only what he knows, his guesses are ours and what comes as unexpected to him is unexpected to us. But he is a seasoned lawyer and most of the viewers are not. Thus, he is able to view the case objectively while we are swayed by our emotions a little. Biegler is not an unreliable narrator, he is a gentleman, yet we see things differently from him. The movie does a great job in pulling off this subtle effect and uses it raise some ethical questions.We all know it is legally and ethically wrong to kill a man for revenge, especially if it is premeditated. But, the defendant, Lt. Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara) is a handsome war-hero. The man he killed was rather uncouth and committed a heinous crime on the soldier's wife. We sympathize with Lt. Manion and want him acquitted, weather or not he went insane before committing the murder.Our sentiments are acknowledged by the movie; Biegler reasons that the jury were likely to feel the same way as we, the viewers, do. The claim of insanity is only an excuse for the law to be followed to the letter. Another layer of complexity is added by Lt. Manion's wife, Laura (Lee Remick). She is sensual and innocent. She is flirty and makes her husband jealous all the time. She seems to have got over the rape pretty quickly. Is it worth all the fuss over a woman like this? Does her nature make the crime committed against her any less brutal? She is certainly concerned about her husband. She seems air-headed but is she? Remick nailed this role and teases us every moment she is on screen.Both the prosecution and the defense know that the crime was committed. The legal battle between them is to prove weather or not Lt. Manion was in possession of his faculties at the time. The prosecution tries to argue that he was. Biegler realizes that it is more important to gain the jury's sympathy and works towards that. The casting of all the characters, major or minor, is done to perfection. The dialog is sublime. Every sentence said by either of the lawyers has a purpose, be it Biegler playing on the minds of the jury and counteracting the prosecution at the same time or the prosecution lawyer, Danser's (George C Scott) increasingly desperate attempts to win. Every argument and counter-argument put forth by them raises the tension and brings relief. The emotions raised by a murder have never been explored to this depth on the silver screen. A true gem of a movie.",

Never before had I seen an actor who so deeply immersed himself into a film such as this. He literally took on the image of John Voelker becoming the man in voice and tonal quality and characteristics. The film also swell illustrated the people of the U.P. and their characteristics. It's a classic for a lifetime.At the time, I was living in the home of James \"Bill\" Kline, President of the Lake Superior and Ishpeming Railroad, a division of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway. It was announced to me by Mrs. Kline that a party was to be held in the home with Mr. Stewart and members of the cast in attendance.

James Stewart is a semi-retired country lawyer who agrees to defend an army lieutenant who has murdered a local bar owner who allegedly raped his wife, a sexy, flirtatious party-girl. The local DA is aided by a smooth attorney from a nearby city. It is the chemistry between this tough, intelligent outsider (George C. Scott) and the shrewd, cynical local defense attorney (Stewart) that gives the courtroom scenes much of their tension. Unfortunately, some of that tension is neutralized by the perverse decision to cast a real lawyer, Joseph Welch, as the judge. His wooden, by-the-numbers non-performance is no asset and suggests that Otto Preminger was more interested in \"making a statement\" than making art. Otherwise, a strong cast does its part to put the twisty plot across. The Duke Ellington score is sometimes effective, sometimes distracting. Good movie scores should be heard but not perceived; Ellington's sometimes invites too much attention to itself",

            "content": "Perhaps I've seen too many movies. Throughout the first half of \"Anatomy of a Murder\" I waited for the revelation of a surprise twist meant to make the audience gasp. Gradually, I began to understand that the concerns of this lengthy courtroom drama were very different from the usual Hollywood fare. The jazz score--not a musical genre usually associated with the Upper Peninsula of Michigan--and words like \"spermatogenesis\" coming from Jimmy Stewart's mouth (Mr. Smith has indeed been to Washington) were clues that this picture was not meant as a \"Witness for the Prosecution\" type of clever courtroom thriller.Once I got past the \"Perry Mason\" expectations, I found the film a spellbinding exercise in American jurisprudence. The ambiguity in the married couple's motives and behavior (played by Lee Remick and Ben Gazzara) is there by design, as is the unresolved ending. The viewer is placed in the position of the jurors--weighing conflicting and confusing evidence and forced to decide what really happened. Given the O.J. Simpson trial more than three decades later, the message of the film is timeless: trial by a jury of one's peers with all the safeguards of our legal system may not always be foolproof, but it's still the best system around. The sobering reality the film raises is the possibility of how easily the legal system can be outwitted by ill-intentioned people who are not legal masterminds.Regarding the script and direction, I was troubled by what appeared to me to be some problems with the plot. If, as was suggested, Lt. Manion was cruel and abusive to his faithless wife, why was she so adamant about defending him? That point was a little too ambiguous for me. And, in contrast to, say, Paul Newman's Frank Galvin in \"The Verdict\"--a disgraced attorney searching for redemption--I couldn't figure out why Stewart's easygoing, devil-may-care lawyer became so adamant, almost to the point of blindness, about defending Manion, even when the red flags about Manion's claim of temporary insanity were hard to miss. He seemed to take everything Manion said at face value. Simply to say Biegler represented the spirit of justice to which all attorneys are ready to rise was not enough for me, as Biegler was not intended as an allegorical or Everyman type of character. I wanted to see some human flaws or frailties in him beyond that he was a little too laid back about his legal practice, at least in Eve Arden's view as his put-upon and unpaid secretary.I've always wondered how well-meaning attorneys can defend sleaze-balls. In the end, I concluded that this film gave me more insight into the defending attorney's duty--to provide the best defense possible regardless of personal feelings--and let the jury decide. It's what everyone is entitled to in our democracy, and thus this well-acted film stands as a useful civics lesson--which is not to say it is dull, but rather thought-provoking.",

Well, that's not what you get with this movie.  The people are human; the situations are ambiguous, and you don't end up necessarily rooting for anyone, let alone for the person you thought you would root for (that would be Jimmy Stewart and his client).  Here we have a lawyer, played masterfully by Stewart, who actually doubts his client's case, and yet defends him, which is a surprising bit of realism; a husband who's terribly jealous either of the rape or the affair (or both?) of his wife; a wife who goes around \"free and easy\" (or \"free and sleazy\" as the case may be) -- but does she deserve to be raped?  DOES she get raped?  Who beat her?  And then the end is a shock, in that it's NOT the end.  It's not typical Hollywood, and at first I didn't like that, but I think I'm changing my mind.

For those of you who did not sit through the entire Army-McCarthy hearings live on TV in the 1954, it may be difficult to understand how a short bald quiet lawyer from Boston destroyed Joe McCarthy in the eyes of the world when everyone else had failed, and few had even attempted.  But watching him in this movie makes it clear how he did it. What a giant he was, and what a brilliant idea on Preminger's part to cast him.

            "content": "I watched Anatomy of a Murder last night on TCM, expecting to renew the acquaintance of a movie I had seen many years in the past. The reunion was not a happy one, however, and I found myself disappointed at almost every turn.The first jarring note (pun intended), came with the Duke Ellington score, which seemed nothing more than an excuse to lay some jazz on the soundtrack without any relation to what was taking place on screen. Time and again these cacophonous cues jolted me out of the movie completely \u0096 exactly the opposite effect to be sought by a music score. Contrast this with the excellent jazz scores by Elmer Bernstein, such as \"Walk on the Wild Side,\" which effectively set the mood and draw the viewer into the drama.The acting was occasionally problematic, most particularly the courtroom histrionics of the normally reliable James Stewart. Why was he yelling so much? I am reminded of an old legal adage: \"If you don't have good facts, pound the law. If you don't have good facts or good law, pound the table.\" Here, however, he had good facts and good law, and no need to be constantly \"pounding the table.\" No doubt this excess zeal can be laid at the doorstep of director Preminger, as can the over-the-top spectator reactions in the courtroom, and the numerous close-ups of George C. Scott, who looked as though he was about to stab someone with his nose. The judge read his lines (it would be an exaggeration to say he played his part) with the passion of a bronze statue, and the prosecutor was played so weak as to leave you wondering how he ever got his job in the first place. Finally, there was the treacly performance of Arthur O'Connell as the alcoholic lawyer reformed by the faith of his friends. That subplot had all the originality of, say, a hooker with a heart of gold. Against these negatives, however, it is only fair to point out the solid performances delivered by Gazarra, Remick, Scott and Arden.Anatomy was made in 1959, adapted from a bestselling book published the previous year, and if memory serves (yes, sadly I am that old) on its release it was viewed as risqu\u00e9 and shocking. Watching it last night, I wondered what all the excitement had been about. The legal issues were anticlimactic and the courtroom sequences were unconvincing and utterly lacking in suspense. It's not so much that this is a bad movie (it isn't), but that stripped of its shock value, it merely whimpers where it should bang.The sad fact is that time has passed it by. For example, in the movie, it was considered scandalous that Lee Remick failed to wear a girdle when going to a bar. Can you imagine? Not wearing a girdle? The fact is that most people alive today have never seen a girdle, and many probably don't even know what they are. Or take the conference at the bench where the three attorneys and the judge struggle unsuccessfully to find a synonym for the word \"panties\" to keep the word from titillating the spectators, as it eventually does when they are unsuccessful. Or the scene where attorney Stewart cross-examines a witness regarding terms used to describe a \"womanizing\" man. When the witness responds \"masher\" Stewart ridicules him suggesting that word to be utterly pass\u00e9. \"Have you ever heard the term wolf?\" he asks the witness. Boy, now there's a cutting-edge term.Watch it for a period piece if you want. Otherwise, this movie simply doesn't pack enough punch or deliver sufficient payoff to justify its 160 minute running time.",

The acting is so consistently good and natural - beyond the scope of consistency of most films - that it becomes totally compelling and demands many viewings. The biggest and most notable fault is Preminger's typical carelessness as far as filming equipment and personnel appearing in the film - compare to his \"In Harm's Way\" for example, where there are shadows, stills, reflections of crew and equipment in the film. This is also evident in this film, and one has to either reject or accept the director's faults in view of the total effect. There are so many moments of visual detail and stunningly subdued acting that it seems hard not to place this as one of the great - and happily not grand - films of all time.",

            "content": "There are some truly great courtroom dramas (\"Witness for the Prosecution\" \"The Verdict\" \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"), but I would argue that Otto Preminger's \"Anatomy of the Murder\" is the best cinematic courtroom drama of all time. Jimmy Stewart plays a lawyer in a sleepy resort community in the upper peninsula of Michigan who's hired to defend serviceman Fredrick Manion (Ben Gazarra in his only second film appearance) for gunning down a local bar owner who he believes raped his wife, Laura (Lee Remick in only her fourth film appearance). There's no mystery who did the murder, but the case hinges on whether Gazarra was in his right mind at the time or was in the grips of an \"irresistible impulse\" at the time of the murder. \"Anatomy\" features an amazing cast of young actors. Stewart, Arthur O'Connell, and Eve Arden are veteran Hollywood actors of the group, and besides Gazarra and Remick you also have a young George C. Scott in his second film role and also early roles for Kathryn Grant, Orson Bean, and Murray Hamilton. Perhaps the most interesting casting is of Joseph N. Welch as the trial judge, who's best know as the real-life lead counsel for the Army in the Army-McCarthy hearings where he uttered the famous line \"Have you no sense of decency, sir?\" This was Welch's first and only acting role, but he's terrific. The folks behind the camera are just as impressive. Produced and directed by Hollywood veteran Otto Preminger (\"Man with the Golden Arm\" \"Advise & Consent\" \"Laura\"), Saul Bass (\"Vertigo,\"Ocean's 11\" and \"Goodfellas\") made an ultra cool title sequence, how can you not love the knockout jazz score by Duke Ellington. Ellington even makes a cameo as \"Pie-Eye\" during a dancehall scene. There's a lot that sets \"Anatomy\" apart from other courtroom dramas. I'm no lawyer, but I've read multiple times how this film is one of the more accurate representations of courtroom proceedings, taking it's time to go through pre-trial research, interviews, and investigations, jury selection, and getting into the minutia of nitpicking objections or manipulating juries throughout the trial. It takes its time to show the court proceedings from start to finish and is almost the entirety of the film. That immersiveness is only part of what makes this film such a classic. The verbal sparing between Stewart, who plays himself up as a simple country lawyer to the jury (when he's anything but), tying fishing lures throughout the trial, setting himself up as the little guy going up against big city prosecutors, the most formidable of which is the great George C. Scott. Their back and forth are simply magic to watch. These courtroom scenes make it the kind of film where if your'e flipping channels and happen upon it, there's no way you can turn it off. And the verbal sparing is not limited to the courtroom. The dialogue between characters outside the courtroom is just as riveting, which gets at what the film is really about, how people endlessly play games with one another. There's always something beneath the surface, or an agenda, or even outright lies in just about every interaction. Sometimes it's just playing around with one another, like when Stewart plays coy about what's he has in a brown bag (it's booze) with a colleague, or Remick flirting with Steward in order manipulate him, or the more consequential moments whether Gazarra was gripped by an irresistible impulse or if he was committing pre-meditated murder. This cynical theme of \"don't trust what anyone says or does at face value\" is given emphasis when Stewart's Paul Biegler states, \"As a lawyer, I've had to learn that people aren't just good or just bad. People are many things.\" This is a must see film that everyone should watch at least once.",

They can't.\"\n\nThis movie might unironically hold the record for the number of the mentions of the word 'panties' in its script. \"Simple country lawyer\" Jimmy Stewart (always wondered where that phrase actually came from) and city suit George C. Scott clash in an early courtroom drama that combined much of what would come to be standard practice in not only legal films but their television counterparts - unsure circumstances, a range of characters with checkered or mysterious pasts, an investigation in the field, and a hotly contested legal battle. \n\nThe film is almost split in half, between the focus on the crime itself as its own little thriller, and the dramatic proclamations of the courtroom. Hard to deny that the film is solidly put together and sustains itself reasonably well through solid performances and just enough breadcrumbs to prevent the audience from nodding off, but it's pretty darn protracted at 2 hours and 40 minutes, and reflecting back relatively little is actually much of a revelation throughout the case. \n\nFortunately, Preminger takes more of a cynical look at the legal system than a Jimmy Stewart character would have if he were back to working with Frank Capra; the similarities between the practices of Stewart's supposedly noble Biegler and Scott's stuffy prosecutor Dancer are notable and could easily be interpreted as an indictment of the legal profession as a whole. There is also some great, simple characterization at play that can easily go unnoticed, as in the case of Brooks West's DA Lodwick; \"Look at this, a real genuine Picasso print\". Immediate establishment as obsessed with the superficial and the appearance of intelligence and taste, good stuff.\n\nFunny to have Duke Ellington in a film in 1959 (after he had already been famous for decades), a film that literally calls out a character's unusual love of jazz, and not even give him a credit.

            "content": "The most riveting courtroom drama ever directed for the screen.\n\nOtto Preminger's massive courtroom drama Anatomy of a Murder (1959) features a full murder trial carried out with meticulous detail and rigorous procedural accuracy. Preminger takes care with his stunningly focused direction. No scene is unnecessary, despite the heavy run-time, as Preminger ensures you are engaged and fascinated by every line, fact, witness, reveal, and outcome. Anatomy of a Murder is taught by law professors for a reason as it is entertaining, realistic, responsible, and thoughtful. You can honestly teach law through each encounter and cross-examination in Anatomy of a Murder it is that good.\n\nI have to say that the two leading performances from James Stewart and George C. Scott are riveting to the end. You get to witness and enjoy arguably the two greatest character actors ever go head to head as opposing lawyers on the defense and prosecution, respectively. James Stewart is funny and likable with a sly manipulation of the facts to a fresh perspective against each testimony. Stewart is ever present in Anatomy of a Murder as we see and understand his thought process and the way in which he builds his case slowly.\n\nOn the other hand, George C. Scott appears halfway through the film and steals many scenes. Scott's relentless line of questioning breaks down his witnesses to admit or reveal facts again and again. Whereas James Stewart finds intrigue in outbursts and performance, Scott thrives in subtle observation and then ceaseless logical tying together of ideas. It's a shame one of them had to lose this cinematic case, but they both fight hard for it. Stewart's slow burn ends up frying his methodical opponent with great flair. I love both James Stewart and George C. Scott's acting within Anatomy of a Murder.\n\nThe cinematography and editing are so interesting. Most of Anatomy of a Murder consists of mid shots of the torso on up to get a feel for the scene. We get a few choice close-ups that wring every ounce of suspense from a character's situation. Sam Leavitt's cinematography is breathtaking with smooth panning shots down roads, through crowds, and across the courtroom. You never see a character that you are not supposed to focus in on in a stylistic decision that I find quite impressive. Likewise, Louis R. Loeffler brings a suddenness to his editing that keeps Anatomy of a Murder moving. The steady pace holds you in suspense, while keeps the audience guessing. Anatomy of a Murder's cinematography and editing are simply top notch.\n\nDuke Ellington's jazz score is mesmerizing and adds a dreamy layer on top of Anatomy of a Murder. The subtle piano passages are as enthralling as the louder horns and lively jazz drumming. The score is iconic and influential, but really contributes a mysterious atmosphere to the entirety of Anatomy of a Murder.\n\nI must mention the adorable dog of Lee Remick's character Laura Manion. This little dog captures your heart with neat tricks and cute faces. I will always remember this sweet dog that brings a lighter mood to darker scenes within Anatomy of a Murder.\n\nLee Remick herself is outstanding as the flirtatious and misguiding Laura Manion. Remick kills with a glance and reveals everything with a look or a word. Her use of seductive and hurt body language alike is very impressive for a young actress. Remick is phenomenal in Anatomy of a Murder just like she is as captivating in The Omen and Thief.\n\nFurthermore, Anatomy of a Murder has a series of stellar supporting roles filled by intriguing characters. Ben Gazzara's fierce army lieutenant is questionable from the beginning and only gets more intense as the film progresses. Arthur O'Connell and Eve Arden are both hilarious and charming as James Stewart's legal aids. Kathryn Grant gives a sweet and mysterious performance that ends up being the final nail in the case's coffin.\n\nLastly, I adored the real lawyer Joseph N. Welch's performance as the amiable judge. His performance rings true with a delightful smile and easy going attitude that makes him a unique film judge. His only anger and frustration comes from Stewart and Scott sending jabs each other's way. He makes Anatomy of a Murder feel all the more genuine for having him included in its already impressive cast.\n\nOverall, Anatomy of a Murder is a beautifully directed film that is well written by Wendell Mayes as based off of Robert Travers' novel Anatomy of a Murder. You will be dazzled by the lead actors, James Stewart and George C. Scott, with their accurate and meticulous courtroom analysis. Anatomy of a Murder will always be worth watching for a frighteningly detailed trial case procedure on screen, but is simultaneously a masterfully directed film from Otto Preminger. Give it a go if you've got some time.",

He is not a pro, just as James Stewart claims himself to be, but a smart cookie like him in the room, could manipulate even the experts of the expensive city lawyers. Armed with such a hefty content embedded by the infamous lawyer-turned-novelist John D. Voelker, this is one of those rare events, where the execution by the director, Otto Preminger, still has managed to surpass the kinetic energy of the film. The entire courtroom seems to be chasing for something it doesn't care for and even after it might get it, Preminger, the trickster, isn't going to reveal the secrets, for his target was never to win the game, but play it, fairly.\n\nWatch him swoosh in camera with a smoothness that is derived more from the flamboyant choreography that stages these characters like chess pieces. And these moments remains to be my favourite. When the lawyers switch in their position or come across a new revelation or cast another perspective in their case, the way they gaze each other as they cross or block or overpower each other.\n\nThis dance is so charming and elegant, that for a brief period, I got lost into their chemistry, forgetting what this fuss was all about. Another major asset is the levity in their narration. The characters never tries hard to lighten the mood, it is just that their nature impacts the humor as a by product- hey, that is the best kind of comedy you can get in a drama like such. James Stewart has a lot in common with the audience. Struggling and shooting in dark aiming to score the points, his confidence in these dodgy testimonies is both absurd and dutiful, he calls it Anatomy Of A Murder, we, the courtroom, the case.",

            "content": "Warning, this review contains spoilers...\n\nFantastic acting, excellent shots on location in Michigan, entertaining courtroom scenes, but a flawed script, and a little overrated.  The premise is simple.  A former prosecutor (Jimmy Stewart) is convinced to come out of retirement to defend a man (Ben Gazzara) accused of murder.  There really isn't any doubt he's done it, since he's confessed.  After some encouragement from Stewart, his plea is not guilty by reason of temporary insanity, that he simply 'lost it' after finding out that his wife (Lee Remick) was raped, and went out and killed the guy.\n\nStewart turns in an outstanding performance, effortlessly combining intelligence and wit, and sparring with the prosecutor brought in from Lansing (George C. Scott).  The scene where he questions his own client after a surprise piece of evidence is introduced by another inmate, real doubt in his eyes, is wonderful.  Scott is also brilliant, sharp and reptilian, quickly surpassing the local prosecutor.  The scene where he deliberately moves back and forth to obscure Stewart's view of a witness is great, and well shot by director Otto Preminger.  Joseph N. Welch as the judge is also strong and such a natural, in one scene appearing in the background with this arm wrapped around his head so that his hand rests on his opposite cheek as he listens intently.  It was also nice to hear jazz from Duke Ellington, and in one scene to see him playing briefly with Jimmy Stewart, though I'm not sure the music always fits.\n\nThe trouble is, even if this is based on a real case, legally and morally, it's a mess.  I certainly didn't want Stewart as protagonist in the role of the defense attorney, where it feels he's in the wrong, starting with him nudging the guy to claim he was temporarily insane.  It's apparent that the only real question is whether that was true, and yet, most of the trial revolves around whether his wife was actually raped, and worse yet, what her possible culpability was in that.  Was she wearing clothing that was too suggestive, was she promiscuous, etc.  Even if you can get past the misogyny of attacking a rape victim, which is a disturbing reality, it's absurd to me that it became so central to the trial, Stewart's 'apple core' argument notwithstanding.  Also, her missing panties get far too much attention throughout the movie, including the dramatic find at the end, when they're irrelevant.  \n\nIn tone, there are several aspects that didn't ring true.  Remick's playfulness and flirtation with Stewart a short while after being brutally beaten and raped, and with her husband charged with murder.  The victim's daughter (played unconvincingly by a constantly wide-eyed Kathryn Grant) remotely considering helping the defense.  The level of levity in the courtroom for a trial involving rape and murder.  In one absurd sidebar, the judge and attorneys sidebar to discuss what panties should be referred to as.  With a very serious look on his face, Scott says \"When I was overseas during the war, Your Honor, I learned a French word. I'm afraid that might be slightly suggestive\", to which the Welch replies \"Most French words are\".   The courtroom then cracks up when he announces that the garment in question will be referred to as panties.  More than once, one attorney or another is surprised by a witness being produced, without having had a chance to independently interview them.  More than once, an attorney will ask a question that he clearly doesn't know the answer to, one that he has no business asking. \n\nMost likely, Preminger amplified all of these theatrics - the jokes, the obsession with Remick and her panties, the banter between attorneys, the little doggie inexplicably being brought into the trial so he can jump up into Stewart's arms - all for entertainment value.  The central theme of what justice should be doesn't get explored enough.  Perhaps that's Preminger's point, that in the circus of a trial with sharp minds on both sides, circling each other like sharks, the system of justice is fallible.  If it was though, the ending doesn't bear that out.  During the 160 minute run time, I kept hoping for a plot twist that never came.  That the guy doesn't just skip out on his bill at the end, he kills his wife in a rage, and calmly deadpans that he did that one too because of an \"irresistible impulse\".  That the wife reveals she was never raped that night, and manipulated her husband into killing.  That either the fellow bartender or the victim's daughter were somehow involved in a setup, for the money.  Nope.  As it is, Stewart's a hero, and if anyone has any qualms about it, they try to pin a happy face on the whole thing by saying his next case is going to be helping the victim's daughter with her estate.  Oh, wow, well that makes it all right then, and let's all leave the theater happy.  \n\nThe film is still worth seeing for the performances - Stewart at 51 is still quite an actor, and endearing as well - but prepare to be conflicted, and a little irritated.",

            "content": "When you throw together actors I love and a genre that I am passionate about, it\u0092s bound to be a hit for me. I was totally riveted by Anatomy of a Murder and the time flew by so fast I never would have guessed it was more than 2.5 hours. Jimmy Stewart delivers brilliantly as the defense attorney, and he has the kind of small-town vibe that feels appropriate for a guy from the Upper Peninsula. (Just a side note: there is not a single person in this movie who sounds like they are from the U.P., but lack of accents is not a big deal.) I loved when George C. Scott showed up as the big-shot lawyer (from my hometown) because he matched Stewart\u0092s intensity. The back and forth between these two great actors was delightful, and I could have taken another hour of it. It was particularly great because the amiable judge was in the middle of it all adding some levity when things got a little overheated.\n\nI think I might be heading into a territory that some might think of as spoilers, so those who want to avoid them, you should probably skip this paragraph of the review: The big risk that Anatomy of a Murder took was leaving it all somewhat ambiguous. A typical movie about a murder trial makes it clear by the end precisely what happened and why. They make it clear that the defendant is either guilty or innocent, and often that is telegraphed very early on so we know who to root for throughout the case. But in this film they stick to the case, they present facts as they are brought up in court, and they never tell you how to feel. Was the murder justified? You decide. Did a rape occur? Maybe. Was justice served? I don\u0092t know. It\u0092s frustratingly open to interpretation, and my own opinion kept shifting throughout the entire runtime. I think this might grow on me if I watch Anatomy of a Murder again, because it puts you in the mind of the jury, but for now I find the lack of clear-cut answers a little aggravating.\n\nI love the way law is practiced in movies. I know that much of the drama and surprises don\u0092t really happen this way in reality, but it is so exciting for me to watch. There are lots of twists and turns in this film that kept me guessing, and the results of the verdict were a mystery to me right up to the end. It did feel like there were some odd rabbit trails taken in the investigation of the case, and I think people who don\u0092t love this kind of movie could get bored with Anatomy of a Murder. However, I took it all in stride and found that many of these things became significant later, so it was all worth the journey. Perhaps the one aspect that never totally clicked for me was the relationship between Jimmy Stewart and his coworkers (the overworked/underpaid secretary, and the drunk partner.) Otherwise, this is a unique film that took some chances and most of the time they paid off big for me. It had moments that made me laugh, and it also had some gripping drama that had me holding my breath. I\u0092m anxious to watch it again and see if it clicks even more on a rewatch.",

Feeling betrayed by his community, he has his own legal practice but hardly tends to it, preferring to go fishing.  Now he gets a huge case - an army Lieutenant has apparently murdered another man after that man allegedly raped his wife.  The case will require every ounce of Biegler's cunning, experience and courtroom theatrical ability, especially when the prosecution bring in a famed hotshot attorney from the state's capital.\n\nBrilliant - the greatest courtroom drama film ever made.  The only similar movies that come close are To Kill A Mockingbird (1962) and Witness For The Prosecution (1957) and though while these have other great qualities neither matches Anatomy of a Murder for sheer courtroom realism and tension. (The TV mini series The Night Of also deserves a mention, I might add).\n\nDirected by Otto Preminger (Laura, Exodus, The Man With The Golden Arm, In Harm's Way, among others), the movie holds your attention for every second of its 160-minute duration.  Engaging, watertight plot with some clever legal twists and turns.  Very realistic and edifying look into the justice system.\n\nAdd to this Preminger's superb direction.  One of the reasons you can't look away is that Preminger wrings the maximum out of every scene and shot - great use of actor's body language and subtle little things that help the plot, mood and intrigue.\n\nCompleting it all is the nagging feeling that you aren't sure whether the accused is guilty or not.  There's no good guys vs bad guys, just prosecution vs defense (like in real life).  It's this ambiguity and mystery that make the movie so gritty and utterly compelling. \n\nAnatomy of a Murder was nominated for seven Oscars in 1960, including for Best Picture, but won none.  1960 was the year of Ben Hur.",

By dealing with rape and the subsequent revenge murder in detail, the cast is able to use descriptive details and words such as sperm or panties that would be too much for younger (or conservative) viewers at home.  Jimmy Stewart is the \"humble country lawyer\" who is craftier than he looks and may or may not be allowing sullen Ben Gazzara to use the temporary insanity defense to excuse his shooting of the man who raped his wife, Lee Remick.  Remick plays the flirt well and allows the film to explore the question of victim-blame - although rather than suggest that she brought it on herself, the script implies that there wasn't a rape at all but rather consensual sex which led Gazzara to fly into a jealous rage.  But was he insane at the time?  George C. Scott plays the slick prosecuting attorney brought up from Lansing (to the Upper Peninsula where the film takes place) to combat Stewart.  What results is a suspenseful drama with a few surprises and some panache (particularly in the context of 1959) from all concerned.  Eve Arden and Arthur O'Connell are solid in supporting roles (on Stewart's team) but this is Stewart's show and he doesn't disappoint (but he doesn't push himself into darker territory like he would in Vertigo or the westerns he filmed with Anthony Mann).

He prefers to fish, harass his underpaid secretary, and hang out with a local drunk who is also an attorney.  One day a murder case falls in his lap that he's enticed to take and prove a military officer innocent, even when it appears there may be some funny business in the case on both sides...\n\n\"I'm sorry if I offended you awhile ago.\"\n\"No you're not.\"\n\nOtto Preminger, director of Laura, A Royal Scandal, Where the Sidewalk Ends, Carmen Jones, Skidoo, Exodus, and Bunny Lake is Missing, delivers Anatomy of a Murder.  The storyline for this picture is amazing and very unpredictable.  The acting and script are brilliant and the film is wonderfully paced despite the long runtime (160 minutes).  The cast includes James Stewart, Lee Remmick, Eve Arden, Bem Gazzara, Arthur O'Connell, George Scott, and Orson Bean.\n\n\"You surprise me sometimes.\"\n'Why?  I've been around.\"\n\nI grabbed this movie off Netflix because I love both Otto Preminger and James Stewart pictures.  This was a very well done courtroom drama and reminded me slightly of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.  The pace of the film is very well done is Stewart and such an amazing and compelling actor.  I strongly recommend this gem!\n\n\"I used to think the world looks better through a glass of whiskey.  It doesn't.\"\n\nGrade: A",

            "content": "I found it interesting the sets and decor. I recognized early on that a lot of thought and a strong emphasis went into the details, the look to make each scene appear appealing and interesting to look at to the audience such as the backgrounds, signs in jail, the shadows of the words Sherif Office stood out in the scenes or designs of the wallpaper or curtains, paintings to make long conversation scenes seem not so boring. \nKeep the eye moving. And for a film largely verbal with very little seen of the crime itself it was very necessary for the audience to be able to look at other things to stay interested in the story. A great deal of this story requires the audience to infer and use your imagination to create the picture of what the troubles were and what happened at the crime scene.  \n\nOne of the things I found it interesting how the audience of the film is not told upfront what the case is all about. so in many ways the perspective or point of view which the audience is learning about what is going on with the case is just like a jury verses from the aspect of the victims or lawyer. \n\nI also realized fairly early on that there is a lot of smoking and alcohol beverage drinking within the film. \n\nI thought is was interesting to watch how the wife acted totally different once Jimmy Stewart mentioned her husband may be watching by looking out the window. She went from very close to her own car door window. She moved to the other side of the car away from the jail window or Jimmy Stewart giving a lot of personal space. \n\nI think that one of the scenes could have been edited out cut when they showed that the victim was with the Psychiatrist.  \n\nPsychiatrist evaluation Temporarily insane. What does that mean? \n\nI was surprised by how Large the courtroom was with two floors and large paintings above that may be 8 or more feet tall. It surprised me because usually you don't see court rooms that large in a film. \n\nI find it interesting yet funny how Jimmy Stewart was seen at the beginning working on something to catch fish while sitting in court to keep him focused. \n\nI find the story interesting in that it is about a controversial issue in the late 1950's like sex or rape. That was an issue rarely heard of fir its time. Things like panties are seen as funny by the Jury in court yet today it is heard more often therefore more common and viewed as not as funny.\n\nOne line that fascinated me that Jimmy Stewart mentioned was somewhat on the lines that; People are not just merely good or bad but are many things. I thought it was an interesting point for its day to bring up. \n\nThe other line that Jimmy Stewarts character brings up is that \"Everyone loves something\" weather it's fishing or any other personal interest. \n\nOne scene that stood out to me from a film aspect was The momentary pause/stare between the husband and wife on the way for the wife to go to the stand. It was a great scene with a lot of tension that leaves the audience curious what exactly could she reveal that may hurt either both herself or her husband whatever she may say. \n\nI thought it was interesting when the Council sued by George C. Scott purposely blocking view of Jimmy Stewart's character. \n\nI enjoyed the realism with ill-relevant discussions that are unrelated to the main story. \n\nThis film stands interesting as this film explores different elements such as  Psychology, fishing, court, police investigation, military aspects are looked at in the film as aspects yet they all come together in the story to create one story.\n\nI found it interesting when Jimmy Stewart brought up the aspect of Country lawyer Jimmy Stewart verses big city lawyer George C. Scott in the courtroom. It identified that there was a major difference in technics or styles how each lawyers went about facing the case. Such as in how the city lawyers has an associate to go to for information verses a small lawyer who had fewer resources to go to. An old style verses the new style of law.\n\nGood points were brought up about how the side with George C. Scott consistently tried repeatedly to not bring up the rape case in court but rather a murder case.",

            "content": "Though this adaptation of a best-selling novel may not seem like it now, it was quite a groundbreaking big deal when it came out.\n\nThe story, a stirring courtroom drama, follows an alcoholic, fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants small town lawyer (Jimmy Stewart going against type), defending a man who openly admits to murdering someone, but only because said individual raped his wife, who, admittedly, is kinda a floozy.  Stewart's character understandably has a lot going against him, and that's not including the fact that the prosecution is made up of some slick, hard-cased big city guys led by George C. Scott.\n\nLike I said, this was a big deal at the time, mostly due to the subject matter, and how director Otto Preminger dealt with it. He did a great job of dealing with stuff that, until then, hadn't really been covered in cinema. Yeah, like I said, some of the impact has diminished, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's still a powerful and engaging piece of work.\n\nThe opening titles by Saul Bass are the stuff of legend, the score by Duke Ellington is a jazz classic, and the performances, as one may expect, are quite good. I mean, there's Stewart, Scott, and Lee Remick as the floozy wife, all of whom are quite great. Oh yeah, and Ben Gazzara as the man on trial. \n\nThis one kinda set the standard for a lot of courtroom dramas to come, and it is quite realistic, accurate, and does a fine job of trying to show things in a pretty down to Earth way. \n\nSo yeah, I dig the film a lot, but I'll admit that the running time could be cut down a bit, and some of the pacing trimmed as well. It's quite engaging, but once in a while it gets slightly boring, but not enough to really derail things. While I don't feel like a lot of people do, I still think this is a fine film worth seeing, even if I don't regard it as a masterpiece like a lot of others do.",

            "content": "160 minutes, this film better actually give me a detailed study on the process of murder on a cellular level that dissects the mentality of a killer. ... Oh yes, because that would be infinitely less boring than a little bit of filler around the edges of a juicy drama. If this film doesn't tell us that you can pull off really long legal dramas, then it's Oliver Stone's \"JFK\"... as well as \"A Few Good Men\", F.F. Coppola's \"The Rainmaker\", \"The Firm\", \"Amistad\", \"A Time to Kill\", \"Judgment at Nuremberg\", Nikita Mikhalkov's \"12\" and \"...And Justice for All\", which feels like it runs somewhere between 130 minutes and two-and-a-half hours. Jeez, people, I know you're able to find plenty of material outside of the courtroom to sustain a hefty length, but for goodness' sake, at least make an attempt at tightening things up. Hey, maybe this film has earned the right to be overlong, not just because Otto Preminger was nothing if not a man who knew a thing or two about making really long films (Dude, why did it take Paul Newman three-and-a-half hours to get around to occupying a boat, then going on a small-scale military mission in \"Exodus\"?), but because it's audacious enough as an extensive discussion on rape and murder in 1959, which is why it's a masterpiece... I guess. Yes, critics, I know that this film was edgy when it first came out, but forget nostalgia, I just want this film to be good on a general standard. Well, in that case, it's a good thing that this film is, in fact, quite good, though this effort would be even better if it wasn't guilty of making some mistakes.\n\nThis talkative thriller has plenty of time to flesh out the depths of its substance, and certainly does do a generally decent job of breathing life into development in certain spots, though not as many as there probably should be, thus making for an exposition-driven drama that doesn't wholly fulfill its expository potential, and leaves enough holes in substance to feel kind of undercooked to the point of slowing down momentum, though not as much as the atmosphere's, well, actual slow spots, of which there are more than I expected. The film is adequately entertaining, but when things slow donw, as they very often do, while dullness never ensues, momentum limps out pretty considerably, and atmosphere dries up just as considerably, blanding things up to a disengaging point that very rarely, if ever leaves the film to dip its toes in underwhelming waters, but decidedly throw things off. Films this talkative need to be careful if they're going to slow down and dry up, and luckily, this film doesn't limp out so often that it falls flat as consistently bland, but there are bland spells, and they retard kick, or at least assist padding in retarding kick. With all of my talk about how this film, at a whopping 160 minutes, is too long, this somewhat minimalist story's execution's relatively sprawling runtime is not simply highly unexpected, but highly unnecessary, being partially achieved through material that outstays its welcome, often going so far as not simply bloat, but tread circles. This film's formula is too tight for the final product to be as lengthy at it is, rarely doing anything outside of building information outside of the courtoom, then dissecting the information found earlier within the coutrtoom, and such a formula, while backed by enough juice to compel through and through, can be drawn out for only so long before it begins to slip into repetition, and sure enough, it doesn't take long for the dynamicity of this over two-and-a-half-hour dialogue drama to grow thin. Whether it be because repetition isn't as severe as it could have been, or simply because compensation for shortcomings is reasonably strong, this film keeps you going as genuinely gripping, but there are nonetheless moments in which grip loosens, occasionally thanks to lulls in exposition, and mostly thanks to bland bloating that could have driven this promising effort into underwhelmingness. Needless to say, underwhelmingness does not claim this film, which is flawed, most certainly, but boasts even more strengths, even within the underexplored musical aspects, which, in all honesty, aren't entirely cleansed of their own issues.\n\nArguably lengedary musician Duke Ellington composes a score for this film that is not used too often, and often has its share of issues when it does, in fact, finally show up, having a lively jazziness that is hardly all that dynamic, and doesn't always gel with this film's conceptually heavy subject matter, but more often than not, Ellington's efforts, when heard, throw in a worthy color to this film that reinforces entertainment value and, to a certain degree, artistic integrity. Even more explored and fitting artistic touches include, of course, Sam Leavitt's cinematography, which, in all honesty, isn't too terribly striking, even for the time, but was still impressive for its time, and has sustained impressiveness throughout the ages, playing with black-and-white limitations of the '50s through clever lighting that graces visuals with a kind of bleak depth that compliments the intrigue of this subject matter, and sometimes proves to be fairly handsome by its own right. Both the musical touches and photographic efforts behind this film play an adequate role in livening up the telling of this tale, though not too large of a role, as the film's more stylish aspects feel a bit underexplored, both in terms of quantity and in terms in richness, thus substance must sustain itself primarily by its own hand, which, of course, makes it a good thing that this film's substance is so valuable. It's not like this film's subject matter is all that unique in concept, and it's not like the ultimate telling of this story is all that smooth, having undercooked spots and relatively limp spells, though not so many that you don't still get a pretty firm grip on the intrigue of this story, because we are dealing with fairly promising material that some filmmakers of the '50s probably could have brought to life more, but wouldn't be done as much justice by most '50s filmmakers as it is in this film, largely thanks to Wendell Mayes' script. Sure, the censors had to draw lines somewhere, so we're not really looking at a legal thriller that is as unapologetically mature in its dialogue as something along the lines of \"JFK\", but when they say that this film, for 1959, got to be pretty edgy with its references during the courtroom sequences, they weren't kidding, as there is some down and dirty talk in the discussions pertaining crimes as brutal as rape and subsequent vengeful murder that are not too shocking in this day and age, but were daringly made at the time so that this film could break down barriers and further flesh out its story's depths, and such flesh-out, unlike shock value, can never be taken away from the final product, whose audacious and extensive exploration of its depths as a legal thriller is still not too terribly profound, but just insightful enough to create some well-rounded thrills in the dialogue department, thus putting some degree of reinforcement behind unevenly distributed exposition, which is further complimented by believable characterization that is itself complimented by pretty strong portrayals behind most every major note to this film's character roster. Whether it be the subtly soulful George C. Scott, or the lovely Lee Remick, or the charismatic James Stewart, most everyone has his or her opportunity to command your attention and breathe some life into this film's depths, though not as much as a certain offscreen performance, because without the inspiration of Otto Preminger, the final product would have collapsed as underwhelming. Preminger's efforts aren't too outstanding, but when his storytelling hits, it grips, sometimes with dramatic intrigue, sometimes with a bit of tension, and consistently with a soul that may not be able to obscure this film's flaws or predictable spots, but manages to grip you, for although there is no getting around this film's behind flawed, Preminger, backed by worthy writing, acting and other touches, drives this courtroom drama as genuinely rewarding.\n\nWhen the case is closed, the film is left wounded by some underdeveloped spots, and takes some serious damage from slow spots that intensify the sting excessive padding, which eventually inspires the repetition that could have driven the final product into underwhelmingness, but doesn't, as there is enough fair liveliness to score work and cinematography, audacity to writing, compellingness to writing and inspiration to direction to subtly, but surely sustain intrigue through and through, and make \"Anatomy of a Murder\" an intriguing legal drama that could have slipped from bonafide goodness, but makes up for its mistakes enough to reward as compelling, maybe even reasonably worthwhile.\n\n3/5 - Good",

He reluctantly takes the case of a man who admits to killing another man.  Biegler hopes he can get the man, Lt. Manion (Ben Gazzara) off with a term called \"irresitable impulse\".  The man killed had just raped Manion's seductive wife, played by Lee Remick.\r\n\r\nGeorge C.

It received much deserved Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Actor for Stewart, Supporting Actors for George C. Scott and Arthur O'Connell.

But the movie's no lesson in metaphysics; the case itself is continually surprising, unusually frank, and always entertaining. James Stewart gives one of his best performances as the morally disinterested defense lawyer (having a lot of fun deconstructing the unwavering all-Americans he played for Frank Capra) as Lee Remick, Ben Gazzara and George C.

Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia, Marcello Mastroianni in 8 1/2, Anthony Quinn in La Strada but I must admit, no one of these beats Jimmy Stewart in Anatomy of a Murder.\n\nHe's pitch perfect as Paul Biegler, the kinda slacky and slow-acting but clever and theatralic small town lawyer and former district attorney who defends Army lieutenant Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara in the second best performance of the film) who is accused of murdering the rapist of his wife.\n\nCourt room dramas are awesome. As much as I love some of the 90s adaptations of John Grisham's novels (A Time to Kill, Runaway Jury) or Sidney Lumet's classic 12 Angry Men, Anatomy of a Murder is both the most realistic court room film (as far as I can tell) and overall the best one I've seen yet.\n\nThe 160 minutes fly by, although much of the film is concerned with Paul Biegler's investigations and the cross-examinations in court (which is not really action film material), it's pretty tense and perfectly paced.\nThere are things going on all the time and the film's ending (although it might be unsatisfying for some) is just a work of genius. Anatomy of a Murder has one of the best scripts of all-time (not so much the dialogue, but the structure and plot) - how it reveals the moral ambiguity of all the characters and the weaknesses of the juridical system (without being too abrasive) is remarkable.\n\nFor all fans of detailed and elaborated storytelling, court room action and great acting - and for all others too - expand your horizons, basterds!",

What is the truth, and will he win his case?''\n\nBrilliant movie. It's probably a bit lengthy, though I wouldn't say unnecessarily so. It's practically flawless. One of the greatest courtroom dramas and entertainments I've seen so far. Uniformly outstanding performances, but I have to single out the James Stewart and George C. Scott performances. Stellar directing by Otto Preminger. Duke Ellington composed a fabulous, though unusual jazz score. Wikipedia: ''This was one of the first mainstream Hollywood films to address sex and rape in graphic terms'' -- I was indeed pleasantly surprised to hear such words like ''panties,'' ''slut,'' ''bitch,'' and ''sperm'' being mentioned. A groundbreaking film for sure. The only misstep for me was right at the very end, the last scene (this is where the SPOILERS come in). He's (the Ben Gazzara character) been found not guilty, by virtue of insanity, yet he's just free to go? Doesn't he at least have to go to an institution or something? At the end of the film, he just takes off with his wife in their trailer... I mean, shouldn't there be some kind of justice for the murdered victim? Maybe I misinterpreted something, and it's not *that* big a thing, but that's the only part that bothered me. Oh, and also as it regards the outcome, I think it was pretty obvious the husband was never (temporarily) insane, nor do I think the wife was raped. The wife's character was just too shallow and sluttish to be innocent. She was most likely having an affair, and the husband knew all about it. I think he just made up the whole rape thing and beat his wife to go along with the story after he killed her lover. But I'm just speculating. I could be totally wrong. You really have to admire how the film doesn't tell us the truth. It's left up to the viewer, in the same way ''Doubt'' was left up to the viewer. Excellent. Anyway, enough of me babbling nonsense. The movie has rocketed into my top 150 favourite films. Storytelling at its finest. Highly recommended!",

Realistic in the courtroom settings and also the way evidence and testimonies are gathered, \"Anatomy of a Murder\" is still the pinnacle of what a trial movie should be, and is still shown in law schools as the truest form of the justice system on film. But as boring as courtrooms can be, Preminger makes sure to keep in very interesting for the viewer, even with the nearly 3 hour length.",

Here is a man convicted of retributive murder after his wife was raped, you feel bad for him, but yet something is off since he beats his wife. So what is right is never cut and dry. It is nothing profound especially where the result has implications on truth, but it does entertain with its good acting, writing, directing and score (Duke Ellington). \n\nStewart is a good touch stone for the movie as the lawyer. At first he seems washed up with drinking, girls and his cynicism, but then he changes to all seriousness when there is a chance to save a man from jail. He is supported by a strong cast, a beautiful Remick, Scott as the big lawyer, Welch as the unusual judge, O'Connell as the need to sober up assistant and the bartender whose name I do not recall. \n\nAnother review needed to be rewritten thanks to flixster messing up! \n\n1001 movies to see before you die.",

            "content": "When U.S Army Lieutenant Frederick \"Manny\" Manion (Ben Gazzara) is arrested for first degree murder when he kills local tavern owner Barney Quill as he believes he raped his Wife Laura Manion (Lee Remick).  Former District Attorney Paul Biegler (James Stewart) who has lost his re-election bid. Biegler now choosing to use his spare time fishing, playing the piano and hanging out with his alcoholic friend and colleague Parnell McCarthy (Arthur O'Connell), as well as his cynical  secretary Maida Rutledge (Eve Arden). Biegler is contacted by Laura Manion wanting to secure his services to defend her incarcerated husband.  Biegler after much deliberation makes the decision to represent Lieutenant Manion.  Biegler realising the chance of getting him off such a charge even with such a strong motivation decides irresistible impulse a version of a temporary insanity as his defence.  Biegler finds himself facing District Attorney Mitch Lodwick (Brooks West), the man who ousted him from office, and Assistant State Attorney General Claude Dancer (George C. Scott) an incredibly smart and ambitious man, when the case comes to trial, holding court is Judge Weaver (Joseph N. Welch, a former U.S. Army Head Council).\n\nAdapted by Wendell Mayes from the best-selling novel of the same name written by Michigan Supreme Court Justice John D. Voelker under the pen name Robert Traver. Voelker based the novel on a 1952 murder case in which he was the defense attorney. Most likely Hollywood director Otto Preminger\u00e2(TM)s most well known and successful film.  The language used while now would seem tame was considered explicit and in one case saw Preminger go to federal court to defend it when Chicago Police Commissioner and Mayor Richard J. Daley startled by its language banned it in the city, the director won the case and the film was shown, the court found the use of the clinical language that Daley objected to, to be appropriate within the context of the film.  While  well received on release, the film was nominated for 7 academy awards and Stewart received the best actor award at both the New York Film Critics Circle Awards and Venice Film Festival,  the film\u00e2(TM)s appreciation has grown even more over the years.   The American Bar Association rated this as one of the 12 best trial films of all time and UCLA law professor Michael Asimow calls the picture \"probably the finest pure trial movie ever made.\" It was also listed as Number 4 of 25 \"Greatest Legal Movies\" by the American Bar Association.  \n\nWhile this clocks in at 161 minutes rarely does it drag or lose your interest, the director uses the first half to introduce the characters and set the scene, the bulk of the second half being the court room. All the actors equip themselves brilliantly both Gazzara and Remick are fine form in the role of the young couple embroiled in the case, Scott\u00e2(TM)s Dancer is a formidable opponent and makes for some effective scenes sparring with Stewart\u00e2(TM)s Biegler.  Stewart an actor by this time with a filmography so impressive adds yet another assured and memorable turn, adding his usual intelligent and humorous character to Biegler\u00e2(TM)s crusading Lawyer, not below goading his opponents and intimidating the witnesses and testing Judge Welch\u00e2(TM)s patience. Welch former Head Council for the U.S army gives a dry reading with subtle humour along with Stewart\u00e2(TM)s lighter hearted persona, offering a contrast to the serious clinical nature of the case. \n\nAnother impressive element of the film is Duke Ellington\u00e2(TM)s terrific score, which won him a Grammy for best soundtrack, one of the first times Jazz was used predominately in a film. Biegler\u00e2(TM)s character himself a jazz fan duets with Ellington on the piano in a cameo appearance as Pie Eye the owner of a roadhouse that Biegler and Laura  have a confrontation at featured early in the film.\n\nHaving only caught this film only once before good 25 years ago or so as teenager one night with my Dad, Despite the time gone by the film as always stuck with me but never had a chance to see it again until now.  I recently purchased a region free blu ray player, one of the main reasons for this was to take advantage of the Criterion Collection, a home entertainment studio devoted to releasing classic films in HD restored using the latest of technology.  Sometimes I feel some people misunderstand the blu ray format, whereas DVD was designed to present a sharper clearer image, blu ray while doing this also allows the film makers and studios to restore the picture closest to when it was originally released. \n\nOne of my friends remarked to me last year when I said was buying my Wife a copy of Some Like It Hot on blu ray for Christmas that he thought this pointless and felt that the charm of old black & white films was their old scratchy appearance and the digital medium would ruin this.  Although I feel if an old film can be restored to look as impressive or more than on original release then this is a plus and the film can still maintain its character as well as have an appearance that would been only seen by those who witnessed when originally exhibited.  This is my first foray into the Criterion studio and I\u00e2(TM)m incredibly impressed, this a new high definition transfer was created on a Spirit 4K in 4K resolution from a new 35mm fine-grain master positive struck from the original camera negative at Cinetech laboratory in Valencia, California. The picture was restored at Technicolor in Los Angeles and Reliance Media Works in Burbank, California.   The film still retains its grain but the contrast is maintained throughout , colours appear rich and strong.  Having the option of both a new 5.1 DTS HD audio track as well as LPCM 1.0 mono track for more purists.  This is indeed an impressive presentation and a suitable treatment  of undoubted classic piece of celluloid.",

Voelker. Despite an epic running time, it manages to hold your attention and it benefits from sharp direction and a jazzy music score. Small-town lawyer Paul Biegler (James Stewart) is struggling to get by and he's trying to get back into the big league of politics after losing the seat of district attorney, he's helped out by friend Parnell McCarthy (Arthur O'Connell) and sardonic secretary Maida Rutledge (Eve Arden). Biegler gets a call from Laura Manion (Lee Remick), wife of the boorish army lieutenant Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara), who has been accused of the murder of a man called Barney Quill, who Manion claims raped his wife. It goes to court, where Biegler agrees to defend Manion, but he meets his match in the courtroom when he's up against prosecution lawyer Claude Dancer (George C. Scott) and D.A Mitch Lodwick (Brooks West). It's a good drama with good sharp dialogue and Preminger gets the best out of his cast. James Stewart puts in another dine performance while this put George C. Scott on the map as a great actor. It's got noirish cinematography by Sam Leavitt and a memorable jazzy score by Duke Ellington, who appears in the film, jamming with Stewart.",

Jimmy Stewart in both lusts after a blonde, of course more vividly in \"Vertigo,\" since it is the central theme. What strikes me most is that Stewart is actually doing a wrong deed in both movies; while in \"Vertigo,\" he is (supposedly) after a married woman, in \"Anatomy of a Murder,\" he is helping out a murderer. Even in all this, we the viewer side with him, because of his charming appearance and how he conducts himself. Excluding the similarities, Preminger has developed a fine courtroom drama with stellar performances from George C. Scott and James Stewart, this being one of Stewart's best films. Rather than finding a verdict, the film is cunningly interested in demonstrating what goes on in a trial in detail; the back and forth debate sequences between Scott and Stewart are the most compelling parts. I still am unsure about the motives of Stewart's character to take the case, unless he needed money or simply because he is an attorney. I have read \"Anatomy of a Murder\" being one of the first films to address sex and rape in explicit terms; you essentially hear Stewart say \"panties\" and \"sperm,\" which was quite unusual. It also has a wonderful music score by Duke Ellington, widely considered one of the greatest composers ever. Otto Preminger's \"Anatomy of a Murder\" is one of the better films to come out of the 1950s.",

Taken as a one-two combo though, this and Advise and Consent make for a potent pair though.  Both are epic in scope, yet are focused on events, characters, and stories that one doesn't associate with epics.  This picture deals with the legal system, while Advise and Consent deals with the political system.  James Stewart and company are superb here, but what really makes it work is the story and the direction.  This is the kind of Hollywood film they don't make anymore.",

The immediate assumption is that someone overdid it.Hire an editor for god's sake. Instead, I'm left feeling that all other courtroom dramas are pale in comparison and must have left out pieces of what was probably more compelling of a story.\n\nIt kicks off like a noir. James Stewart is a recently voted-out prosecutor just about to give up like his alcoholic partner; but instead get a call. Simple defense case. Woman gets raped, husband kills the rapist, now he wants help getting off. A couple of things stand in the way of making it an easy case. A. the guy pretty much a hothead asshole. B. The rape victim is more than a little unsympathetic. Part of the noirness of the first act. Lee Remick is flirty; not really sad when describing the rape, dresses in a way that attracts dog-like attention, loves that attention. Her dog is named \"Muff\", which I'm sure is lost on no one.\n\nIn this noirness, I would have liked to have seen Bogart replace Stewart who was teetering on the edge of inapprpriateness with his new client. Seemed out of character for Jimmy. But when the court drama starts, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the forefront.\n\nThis is one of the best courtroom films I have ever seen. The largest part of the greatness is how George C. Scott dances in from the big-city prosecutor's office. He's astute and rude, but plays it with class- as if you're supposed to be impressed with being treated this way. And Stewart himself vollys back. Playing the shy local boy who's getting railroaded by the big important men.\n\nThe movie doesn't rely on big twists or plot reveals. They fight about the motivation of killing a man. And whether to talk about his wife at all. When they do, they step right into the \"isn't she really just a tramp?\" rhetoric. Not because of some nasty legal boy's club. But simply because one side wants to",

The first half was dragging out to long but once they got to the court scenes the drama started spicing up. This was one of those films where you had to listen closely to understand what was going on. The writing in this was really good. They where using words that I didn't know and the script could have easily have been a book. This has a script that I would enjoy reading except that it would be to long. The film didn't feel long that's if you pay attention. The ending and the overall resolution of the film still bugs me. I don't know what to think whether he's innocent or guilty. All this technical law stuff sure is difficult for me to take in. I would never want to be a lawyer. The acting was good except the judge's. I understand that he wasn't an actor but a real life judge and it was his only role ever in a film. I felt as if he was reading directly from the script.

They're judges, they're probably smart, they could throw a book together, and after awhile your bound to have seen a few noteworthy cases that people would be interested in. I guess today the book just wouldn't succeed though for the same reason most courtroom dramas no longer do well at the box office, Audiences are inundated with TV shows about criminal proceedings. Without fail millions of people every week watch serialized retellings of interesting court cases through Law & Order, CSI, NCIS and their countless spinoffs to the point where you've probably seen a lot of the twists and turns court cases and police proceedings have to offer from a story telling perspective. But this film comes from a simpler time, when TVs weren't showing the same boring and unrealistic criminal cases every waking hour of the day, and IS based on a book written by Michigan Supreme Court Justice John D. Voelker about a case he oversaw. It was adapted and brought to the screen by at the time controversial director Otto Preminger who had entered the phase in his career where he challenged Hollywood norms, fresh off of filming The Man With the Golden Arm about a drug addict. Preminger was notoriously hard to work with and caused some people to leave production, but ran a tight ship and made one of the most important films in his day. It challenged the Hollywood taboo of rape, with perfectly open and frank dialogue regarding the crime and attempted to capture the events with documentary like realism. Despite the limitations of the time he filmed much of it on location, even using a lot of the same jury members who sat in on the original case and casting actual Judge Joe Welch as the big city judge who famously during the McCarthy hearings told the man \"Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?\" But as always the big question is, how does it hold up? Is it worth your time or has it aged laughably poorly? Let's take a pantied look.\r\n\r\nOur film is actually more about the small town Upper Michigan Lawyer Paul Biegler (James Stewart, still taking challenging roles and acting the hell out of them midway through his career) who recently lost a reelection bid for DA than the subjects of the case. Biegler spends most of his time fishing, and reading law with his elderly friend Parnell McCarthy (Arthur O'Connell who's character I found very annoying) and becoming a regular recluse to the chagrin of his secretary Maida (Eve Arden, who has some pretty witty lines from time to time). He is brought out of his self imposed exile however when he is contacted by Ms. Laura Manion (Lee Remick, giving one of the most spirited and challenging turns of the whole movie) who's husband has recently murdered a local bartender under the belief the man had raped her. Against his better judgement after a rocky first meeting Paul takes the case of Lt. Manny Manion (a young Ben Gazzara who gives the best performance here to the easily most interesting and least black and white character) under the grounds he had an \"irresistible impulse\" to kill the man due to temporary insanity. And so begins the legal dogfight between Paul and the man who beat him for the DA position as well as revered city prosecutor Claude Dancer (George C. Scott, he doesn't talk much in this but when he does hold on to your hats because it blows them all away).\r\n\r\nThis is actually a very good movie, it's well done and despite being mostly dialogue driven is consistently interesting and captivating for its over two and a half hour run time that would feel bloated for some films. The performances are all top notch, even if I found the character of Parnell to be insufferably annoying and unlikeable, and I really enjoyed how no one here is really 100% in the right or in the wrong. These characters walk the line in the grey area of morality and that's certainly part of what drives it. Duke Ellington (who actually makes an appearance playing piano with Stewart at one point) delivers some of his freshest work for the score, and despite being over fifty years old now and in black and white the cinematography captures the small town and its many settings rustically and realistically. One of the main things I enjoyed about it though, is that the lawyer who's acting the fool in court and putting on all the theatrics is the protagonist this time not the other way around. Paul is painted as a hometown hero of sorts, against the big city outsider of Claude and yet he's the one putting on a show and making all the jokes and basically doing the types of things that should end with a man being held in contempt. He even at one point deliberately makes an accusation on no grounds whatsoever that he knows will be stricken from the record on the basis that the jury can't \"un-hear it\" as a matter of fact this is one of his main tactics. But it's also not a perfect movie mostly due to its strange ending so I'll throw up a SPOILER here right quick. As the movie ends Paul has put his faith in Lt. Manion and he successfully gets him off on the \"irresistible impulse\" defense. Well than when he heads by Manion's trailer to collect the fee he waived till after the proceedings he sees the Lieutenant has flown the coop without paying and left him a sarcastic letter implying he was in full control of his faculties during the murder. There's even evidence that he beat his wife and took her against her will with him, and despite having shown compassion and desire to protect the naiive little nymph Paul and Parnell laugh it off and make a joke. Alright, the defendant ending up being the piece of shit the prosecution made him out to be, a good twist and even a refreshingly dark ending but the fact that Paul doesn't seem to care at all made him very unlikeable to me in that last scene. I don't expect him to rush to the girls rescue, but at the very least it would have been nice to see him show some remorse for having ruined her life and gotten a murdering douche off Scott-free. Oh well.\r\n\r\nI really did enjoy this, I wasn't sure I would but due to its uncharacteristic for the time period frankness it ends up being a movie far ahead of its time and holds up pretty damn well today. I hesitate to call it perfect, but it's an ethically complex and suitably well made courtroom drama from a time when this was a suitable and effective genre. Furthermore it's one of the best performances I've seen from Jimmy Stewart who is usually a very good actor but one I dare say is often times just playing himself. Not to mention the fact that anyone else his age would have seemed creepy talking about panties and girdles as much as his character does. If any of these things appeal to you I'd say this is well worth checking out but if not that's understandable and I wouldn't call it a must see.",

Once Paul finds out more, he decides for sure that he wants to support them, and that's when the movie begins. Otto Preminger certainly proved his genius in this 1959 courtroom drama. This film is so pure and original, and every single actors performance is taut and believable. James Stewart certainly showed his chops as his lawyer, and whoever won the Oscar didn't deserve it because Jimmy did! As well as Stewart, Remick and Gazzara do great with those small but important roles they had, as well as Arthur O'Connell and George C. Scott who definitely deserved their nominations. Surprisingly too, this movie is full of language that was known for being one of the first movies to challenge the Hays Code, and, it was one of the first movies to do with rape, so as well as being so good, it's groundbreaking. Duke Ellington's music adds so much, and the witty script with dry jokes ease the tense mood. Anatomy of a Murder is a spectacular film, and if you like \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", you'll love this.",

            "content": "Despite its credentials as a first-class courtroom drama, \"Anatomy of a Murder\" squanders some of its excellence on the slow-moving, not particularly involving details of the case. One law professor labeled this one of the best \"pure trial\" movies ever made. Had the film merely stuck with the trial, rather than the circumstances around it, that assessment would seem more accurate. \n\nSemi-retired attorney Paul Biegler (Jimmy Stewart, excellent as always) is called upon by Laura Manion (Lee Remick) to assist in the defense of her husband (Ben Gazzara), a cad of an Army officer on trial for murdering a bar tender. In addition to getting his client off though the odds -- a crime of passion filled with less-than-savory circumstances -- are stacked against the defense, Biegler also takes it upon himself to protect Laura from accusations against her character -- accusations that may have more than just a grounding in reality. \n\nBiegler's chief opponent in the courtroom is Dancer (George C. Scott), a highly professional lawyer who, despite his outward calm and decorum, is more like a feral animal making concentrated attacks against anyone who crosses his path. The finest scenes revolve around Stewart and Scott going toe-to-toe in the courtroom, the simple country lawyer (who possesses more cunning than he lets on) and the big-city prosecutor frequently at odds. \n\nDirector Otto Preminger often seemed a filmmaker unwilling to tell a straightforward story, loading each frame with character flourishes which, despite giving color to the smoky, monochromatic, tense yarns he commonly brought to the screen, tended to trade personality for storytelling. Though it's an admirable trait (especially in this era of plot-driven, flavorless, forgettable spectacle), the sacrifice of pacing makes his films difficult to sit through. The introduction of a witness who turns out to be the victim's daughter, for example, proves less integral to the film than Preminger might like us to believe (though it does lead to a major obstacle for the prosecution).\n\nLike the earlier \"The Man with the Golden Arm,\" Preminger makes us spend time with his characters and makes them into three-dimensional individuals. Unfortunately, he uses less discretion in knowing whom the audience would NEED to spend time with to best advance the story, tarnishing the luster of the passionate, truly peerless scenes in the courtroom.",

It is a brilliant tale of a rape, a murder, a pair of panties, a colorful trial, and a savvy southern lawyer.\r\nThe story centers around Paul Biegler (Jimmy Stewart), a former District Attorney who takes on the case of a military man who's murdered his wife's rapist.  The man in question is Lt. Frederick Manion (Ben Gazarra).  Manion is a cold man who really doesn't mourn the loss of the man he killed.  His wife, Laura Manion (Lee Remick), is about as loose as a woman could be in those days without being fully promiscuous, though one can't help but wonder about that.  Laura has no reservations about being flirty with anyone, even Biegler.  She wears form-fitting clothing and is constantly suggestive.  Frederick is a jealous man when it comes to his wife, and her nature certainly doesn't help.  Biegler, along with us in the audience, obviously wonders if this jealousy was the real reason behind the murder, and even whether or not Laura was even raped.  In the end, however, what matters in this film isn't just the facts, but the courtroom procedure itself.\r\nBiegler is never presented as some kind of hero, nor is his client or the wife.  Biegler isn't a bad man, but he can be a very unscrupulous lawyer, as can they all.  His legal battle in the courtroom with the adequate but overmatched D.A. and his far more qualified partner, Claude Dancer (an excellent George C. Scott) is brilliantly written, highly entertaining, and surprisingly cavalier.  The atmosphere created by the animated attorneys and the less-than-overbearing Judge Weaver (Joseph Welch) makes for the most colorful courtroom I've ever seen in a serious-minded film.  The effect is marvelous.\r\nAnatomy of a Murder is one of the most exceptional courtroom dramas ever filmed.  Jimmy Stewart, whom I believe to be the greatest American actor of his day, is brilliant as always and his verbal sparrings with George C. Scott are a treat to watch.  The only thing the film lacks is a person to like or root for, particularly in the defendant or his wife.  They're highly unlikeable, though not so flawed that we hate them, we just don't feel too sorry for them.  A minor flaw in an otherwise masterful film, one that was way ahead of its time in both content and writing.  The screenplay is one of the best I have ever heard.\r\nAnatomy of a Murder is a true masterpiece.",

It appears that he takes on the case because of the fact that it centers around a woman, rather than he insatiable need for justice. \nThe courtroom scenes itself are very interesting. Rather than try to just bedazzle the audience with big speeches and wild twists, Preminger paces the twists and turns in a way that makes the viewer feel as though this could have been a real court case. There are no John Grisham moments, but the drama is still very palpable.  \nStewart actually surprised me as the morally ambivalent man of the law. George C. Scott is also terrific as the prosecutor. \nIt I had not recently watched Judgment at Nuremberg and have Kramer's flawless camera work in that film fresh in my mind, I would have rated it higher.

James Stewart gives a thrilling performance as Paul \"Polly\" Biegel, a small-time defence lawyer eager to win his case of a man accused of murder. Dominating the prosecution side is George C. Scott, who in this film immortalised the character of the stubborn, insensitive prosecution lawyer who the audience love to hate. For the time that it was made, it's an extremely potent film, and while it takes a bit of time to get started, it definitely stands as one of the best in its genre.",

Scott, all of whom performed wonderfully in this film. That being said, this film is not without its detractors, including its unfortunate lack of knowledge of the legal system...\r\nFor, you see, my dear readers, pleading insanity does NOT set a man free from his murder charge--as is the lawyer's desired outcome in the film--but instead commits the defendant to a mental hospital to undergo treatment. Oh, and the insanity plea is used less than 1% of all criminal cases and has but a 26% success rate and 90% of the successes have histories of mental illnesses. Now, even assuming that the defendant of this film fit into the 1%, 26%, and 10% respectively, he still needs to be committed by the end of the film. He won't be able to just walk free.\r\nThat's my biggest problem with this film, and it is a big problem because that was in the back of my mind throughout the whole picture.\r\nStill, this is a beautifully directed film with a lot of great actors working together to craft a lovely story, including George C. Scott, Lee Remick, Murray Hamilton, and James Stewart. This pretty much over turns a lot of the story's flaws, although not all of them. James Stewart is absolutely brilliant in any film, and Anatomy Of A Murder is no exception.\r\n7/10",

The story was pretty similar to a lot of movies such as these, but the direction by Otto Preminger was fantastic. Despite the long length of this film, unlike many courtroom dramas Anatomy of a Murder really keeps you interested throughout the entire film. The screenplay was also very good. I laughed out loud several times in the film, and I can tell you there is no better battle then James Stewart and George C. Scott for a courtroom drama.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe acting was superb by everyone. I found no one in the film to be a bad actor, and I really loved some of the performances. James Stewart delivered one of the best I have ever seen him. I still believe that It's a Wonderful Life was his career performance, but this was definitely up there in his best. This is one of the only films I have seen with George C. Scott, but he was amazing in this film. The most interesting parts of the film was hearing James Stewart and George C. Scott yell \"objection!\" every single time one of them would say something.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, Anatomy of a Murder is probably the greatest, or at least one of the greatest, courtroom dramas I have ever seen.

(especially because of it's long running time) But this movie in the day did break the boundaries for openness of sex and rape, and presents some great acting from James Stewart and  George C. Scott.\r\n\r\nThis film is a courtroom drama about James Stewart who plays a lawyer defending a former officer of war for the murder of a man who raped his wife. Stewart's character is slick and a smoothtalker when on the job, and he pulls many dramatic expressions and statements when in court. He is going to need everything he's got to persuade the jury, especially when he's defending a man with such an unclear motive for his actions. This movie was very well written and portrays a courtroom case in a very dramatic but natural fasion. But most of the entire movie is in the courtroom and the movie does stretch out too much, especially when it constantly leans towards the innocence of Stewart's client.\r\n\r\nThere are some very interesting shots throughout the movie, which is always great to see in older movies. This film was also nominated of 7 Oscars, including one for Stewart and Scott, Best Cinematography, Editing, and Best Picture.\r\n\r\nThough as slow as this film may be, and though it's pretty mild to today's standards, it is none the less a movie that made an impact in the day, and it is supported with great acting for James Stewart fans. When in the mood, it can be a very intriguing courtroom drama because the movie gives you that feeling that you really can't trust the defendant and his wife. And that's always a good direction.",

Anyway, this is something of a barrier-breaker morally for its time, but not much more about it sets it apart from today's typical episode of Law and Order, short of its sweet soundtrack and a couple of strong performances. Lee Remick and George C. Scott really stand out, even despite the lesser offerings, like the prosecutor who is not George C. Scott and the judge, who is obviously trying too hard. Anatomy of a Murder is also really fucking long and not all that well paced and that subplot jaunt into Canada is completely, totally unnecessary. \n\nDespite the infirmities of technique, the movie still holds up fairly well and is definitely worth a watch, especially if you're a Jimmy Stewart fan.",

It's enough that the centerpiece of the film is an argument about allowing the fact of the rape to be considered in the testimony. This alone puts this 1959 near-masterpiece in the realm of timeless, and squarely in the modern mode. The erosion of the code is in full swing, and swing is a good word for it. Along with a script that crackles with fun at each turn of the courtroom statement, how can you go wrong with a movie that shows Jimmy Stewart in a juke joint sitting beside Duke Ellington on the piano bench and jamming along? The joys of this one never seem to end, and the trump card, along with a handsome full frame presentation on dvd, gorgeous noirish shooting, and Preminger's perfectionism, we get a cast turning out aces, whether it's Lee Remick's wolf-whistling strut as the young and peachy wife, or Ben Gazzera's not-so-innocent ego-wounded husband. The real pearls, apart from Stewart doing what he does best, are Eve Arden's stalwart girl friday and Joseph Welch's utterly and endlessly delightful role as the judge. Knowing the background of Joseph Welch, that he was in fact a real judge who trounced Senator McCarthy during the famous hearings, only adds to the pleasure of the performance. The film on all levels is eloquent, and sharp, and very funny, and nuanced to the point that we forget at times the tenuousness of the argument in the protagonist's favor, or the apparently obtusely skewed values when it comes to viewing Remick's situation, certain articles of clothing, and the significance of the harm done to her. Sometimes it's alarming how great film art can be, in all the best ambiguous ways.",

He is not a pro, just as James Stewart claims himself to be, but a smart cookie like him in the room, could manipulate even the experts of the expensive city lawyers. Armed with such a hefty content embedded by the infamous lawyer-turned-novelist John D. Voelker, this is one of those rare events, where the execution by the director, Otto Preminger, still has managed to surpass the kinetic energy of the film. The entire courtroom seems to be chasing for something it doesn't care for and even after it might get it, Preminger, the trickster, isn't going to reveal the secrets, for his target was never to win the game, but play it, fairly.Watch him swoosh in camera with a smoothness that is derived more from the flamboyant choreography that stages these characters like chess pieces. And these moments remains to be my favourite. When the lawyers switch in their position or come across a new revelation or cast another perspective in their case, the way they gaze each other as they cross or block or overpower each other.This dance is so charming and elegant, that for a brief period, I got lost into their chemistry, forgetting what this fuss was all about. Another major asset is the levity in their narration. The characters never tries hard to lighten the mood, it is just that their nature impacts the humor as a by product- hey, that is the best kind of comedy you can get in a drama like such. James Stewart has a lot in common with the audience. Struggling and shooting in dark aiming to score the points, his confidence in these dodgy testimonies is both absurd and dutiful, he calls it Anatomy Of A Murder, we, the courtroom, the case.",
