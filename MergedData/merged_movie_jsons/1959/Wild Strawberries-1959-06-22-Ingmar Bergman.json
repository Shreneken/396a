            "content": "Although I'm not the biggest Ingmar Bergman fan, I have really enjoyed some of his movies--especially the one that are not so pessimistic. Although the underlying theme of this movie is aging and impending death, the movie is NOT all pessimism. If it had been, it would have lost my interest early on. Instead, I really enjoyed the film--particularly the fine acting by Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m as Professor Borg.The professor is well-respected for his work as a doctor. However, despite his success in his career, he is a failure in his personal relationships. His emotional baggage over the years has prevented him from allowing himself to be close to those he truly loves. This theme mirrors one of the subplots of Through a Glass Darkly, where a father is being destroyed inside by his daughter's mental illness but he CANNOT allow himself to show his anguish--choosing instead to hide in his room with his tears. It is interesting that the same man playing Borg's son (Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand) plays the father only a few years later in Through a Glass Darkly.Fortunately, unlike Through a Glass Darkly, there IS evidence that the professor is willing to change his persona, as he begins to open up more through the course of the movie. This appears to be assisted through extensive soul searching and dreams the professor has concerning his past and his own mortality--along with experiences he has during a long drive down the coast of Sweden. Because of this, even his extremely strained relationship with his son appears to hold some hope of improvement by the film's end. This hope for change lifts this movie above some Bergman films that only wallow in hopelessness.FYI--The Criterion version of this DVD is nice due to its running commentary as well as the accompanying documentary. Get this version if you have the chance.Also FYI--After watching many Bergman films and reading about his life, I detect quite a bit of autobiography in this film and his own stuggles with intimacy.",

            "review_title": "When film was an art form",
            "content": "In this symbolic tale of an old man's journey from emotional isolation to a kind of personal renaissance, Ingmar Bergman explores in part his own past, and in doing so rewards us all with a tale of redemption and love.Victor Sjostrom, then 80 years old, stars as Professor Isak Borg whose self-indulgent cynicism has left him isolated from others. Sjostrom, whose work goes back to the very beginning of the Swedish cinema in the silent film era, both as an actor and as a director, gives a brilliant and compelling performance. All the action of the film takes place in a single day with flashbacks and dream sequences to Borg's past as Borg wakes and goes on a journey to receive a \"Jubilee Doctor\" degree from the University of Lund. Bergman wrote that the idea for the film came upon him when he asked the question, \"What if I could suddenly walk into my childhood?\" He then imagined a film \"about suddenly opening a door, emerging in reality, then turning a corner and entering another period of one's existence, and all the time the past is going on, alive.\"Bibi Andersson plays both the Sara from Borg's childhood, the cousin he was to marry, and the hitchhiker Sara who with her two companions befriends him with warmth and affection. The key scene is when the ancient Borg in dreamscape comes upon the Sara of his childhood out gathering wild strawberries. Borg looks on (unnoticed of course) as his brother, the young Sigfrid, ravishes her with a kiss which she returns passionately; and, as the wild strawberries fall from her bowl onto her apron, staining it red, Borg experiences the pain of infidelity and heartbreak once again. Note that in English we speak of losing one's \"cherry\"; here the strawberries symbolize emotionally much the same thing for Sara. Later on in the film as the redemption comes, the present day Sara calls out to Borg that it is he that she really loves, always and forever. Borg waves her away from the balcony, yet we are greatly moved by her love, and we know how touched he is.The two young men accompanying Sara can be seen as reincarnations of the serious and careful Isak Borg and the more carefree and daring Sigfrid. It is as though his life has returned to him as a theater in which the characters resemble those of his past; yet we are not clear in realizing whether the resemblance properly belongs in the old man's mind or is a synchronicity of time returned.Memorable is Ingrid Thulin who plays Mariana, the wife of Borg's son who accompanies him on the auto trip to Lund. She begins with frank bitterness toward the old man but ends with love for him; and again we are emotionally moved at the transformation. What Bergman does so very well in this film is to make us experience forgiveness and the transformation of the human spirit from the negative emotions of jealousy and a cold indifference that is close to hate, to the redemption that comes with love and a renewal of the human spirit. In quiet agreement with this, but with the edge of realism fully intact, is the scene near the end when Borg asks his long time housekeeper and cook if they might not call one another by their first names. She responses that even at her age, a woman has her reputation to consider. Such a gentle comeuppance meshes well with, and serves as a foil for, all that has gone on before on this magical day in an old man's life.See this for Bergman who was just then realizing his genius (The Seventh Seal was produced immediately before this film) and for Sjostrom who had the rare opportunity to return to film as an actor in a leading role many decades past him prime, and made the most of it with a flawless performance, his last major performance as he was to die three years later.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

            "content": "\"Wild Strawberries\" profoundly moved me. The theme -- an old man coming up fast on death and wondering if his life has had any meaning -- is an old one for Bergman, and one which he explored ad nauseum throughout the subsequent decades. But here Bergman approaches the question with an uncharacteristic optimism and sense of hope. For once, he seems to come close to finding some peace with the unknowns of life that obviously preoccupied him as an artist, and the movie he gives us is sad but immensely warm; resigned but calm and reflective.An unequivocal masterpiece, and only one of a handful of Bergman films (\"Persona\" and \"Cries and Whispers\" being two others) that don't drive me over the edge when I watch them now.Grade: A+",

            "content": "I'd seen \"Wild Strawberries\" as a college freshman when it was first released, and knew right away I'd be a Bergman fan from then on. \nI watched it again just last night, January 2004, at age 63, and needless to say got a whole different perspective on the film.  Where the surrealist touches, moody photography, and incredibly smooth direction had made the big hit with me as a near boy, as an aging man I found myself--I hesitate to say painfully, but...well, closely--identifying with old Isak Borg in his strange pilgrimage, both interior and exterior, the day he receives his honorary degree at the cathedral in Lund.In the last twenty minutes or so of the movie, I found tears running down my face, not from any thrilling sentimental browbeating (I doubt if Mr. Bergman shot five seconds' worth of sentimentality in his whole long career!) but simply from the cumulative emotional impact of this simple, powerful story and its probing revelation of human character, desire, and chagrin. \nBy the time the film ended, I felt wrung out, disoriented, happy and deeply sad at the same time: it's the experience the Greeks wanted their tragedies to convey to the spectator; they spoke of \"katharsis.\"  I experienced it firsthand when I had the great good fortune to see a production (in English) of \"Medea.\"  I walked away in tears and scarcely able to think straight for an hour or so.  The same thing happened with \"Wild Strawberries.\"  This is one of the handful of films I unhesitatingly rate a \"ten.\"A side note: I watched the Criterion Collection DVD.  Before the film itself, I watched the hour-long interview conducted in 1998 by Jorn Donner included on the disc.  It was remarkable to see how the film Bergman shot ca. 1957 contains many elements that were to be present in his later life--like a foreshadowing of his own old age.",

            "content": "(Slight Spoilers) A man's life journey is all seen through a number of dreams and hallucinations on his trip, some 400 miles, to the town of Lund where he's to receive a lifetime achievement award for his 50 or so years of service to his fellow man as a doctor and a professor of medicine at his alma mater the Cathedral of Lund.Disturbed by a dream he had the night before Isak Borg decides to take a ride by car, not plane, to Lund for a ceremony thats to be in his honor for his work as a man of medicine. Isak's maid for some 40 years Agda is very upset with her boss' and good friends decision and decides to stay at home, she'll eventually show up at the ceremony, feeling that the old man has somehow lost control of his senses. It turns out that the long car trip together with his daughter-in-law Marianne was one of the best decision that he made in his long life, Isak is 78 years old. The trip that Isak takes will bring back past memories that he so desperately tried to hide from himself. That past will in effect make him not only a better person but bring back the feeling of humanity that he lost not only for himself over these long and empty years. Not only for Isak but for those close to him whom he more or less also lost contact with. Isak,in both his dreams and memories, is seen as a man who is unable to show any real feelings for those around and close to him in the fear of either being rejected as well as showing himself to be hurt by their negative responses.This defect in Isak personality has cost him the love of his life Sara when he was a young man who rejected him for his handsome and openly aggressive older brother Sigfried. We also see that Isak's marriage to his wife, who had long since passed away, Karin was anything but happy with her disgusted with his inability to show her any real feelings and emotions as a husband. Were also shown, in one of Isak's dreams, that she had an affair with another man Ake Fridell, who was anything but passive with her like her husband Isak was, some 40 years ago behind his back. That may have possibly resulted in the birth of his only child his son, who's also a doctor, Evald Marriane's husband.Seeing his 96 year-old mother on his way to Lund we see in her the same human defect that he has in that all of her ten children, who with the exception of Isak are now deceased, never bothered to visit her in her old age. The only time that they had anything to do with her was when they wanted money from the old lady. This coldness and inability to have any attachment to her children is shown not only in both Isak and his mother but in his son Evald who's so disgusted with life and what it had to offer him, like a beautiful and caring wife like Marianne. Evald threatened to walk out on Marianne when after he found out of her being pregnant, I guess by him, she refused his demand of her getting an abortion.Isak is helped on his long trip to Lund not only by Marianne but a number of people they meet and in some cases give a ride along the way. This included a young girl and two of her friend going on a trip to Italy ironically named Sara, a virtual twin of the Sara that he loved and lost as a young man. Later Sara together with Anders and Victor who later as a singing group serenade a surprised and grateful, to the point of tears, Isak after he received his award. Meeting among others along the way to far flung Lund a bickering couple Mr. & Mrs. Alman, who almost had Isak and his passengers killed in a head-on car crash. Isak also met a gas station attendant, Henrik, who was so impressed and grateful by what he did for him and his wife in the past , delivered their first child, that he refused to get paid for filling up Isak's gas-tank.By the time Isak got to Lund and received his lifetime achievement award to the attendance and cheering of the entire town he not only realized all the good that he did as a man of medicine all these years but also all the hurt that he gave to others, if unintentional. With the little time that he has left, Isak was to pass away three years later at the age of 81, Isak is determined to make up for it.Sweet touching yet simple little film about one man's journey back in time who sees how he missed out on the many wonderful things that life had to offer him by being blind to them. Now given a second chance Isak would try as best as he can to both re-live and at the same time correct his past mistakes.",

It is not a story of an old man who discovers images of his past, about a marital crisis or some teenagers. It is not a confession. It is a mirror. The same crisis is the \"gift\" of everybody. The same silence, fear and desire are the refuge of a man, a woman, a n American or Irakian. At a moment, at a single moment, you discover your past like only reality. Like your real skin, your only voice, your essential eye. It is not strange. We are the fruits of some experiences. Some books, some people, a family, a child or a wife are the Ganymedes of our hours, our evolution, our death. Our freedom, our gestures, our smile are the trees of their presence. Isak Borg is the image of a age. Our age who grow-up in the noise of every day. The isolation is only way to be yourself. The way to Lund, the relation with Agda, the empty attitude, the projection in Evald, the words are the symbols of a clock who is seed of our conscience. Childhood is only reality of our life.",

Bergman's autobiographical story also benefits from the brilliant casting of Swedish film legend Victor Sjostrom as Isak Borg, whose towering performance is essential to the success of Wild Strawberries.  I read that Bergman based the coffin dream sequence on a frequent nightmare that he had -- and it never ceases to amaze me just how effective it remains even after all these years.  Wild Strawberries seems like a quiet, thoughtful, introsepective movie -- and it is; it is also one of world cinema's most impressive motion pictures.",

In this piece of genius, we are asked to consider who God is; what makes a life worthwhile; and whether human nature alters through the generations, or is it just the costumes that change?  As usual, the answers are to be provided by the audience.  We must chose for ourselves what we think is 'right' or 'just'. Bergman uses the usual pattern for him - a man is on a journey (life) and meets people who are going along the same road (friends and family), and they all head toward the end of their trip (death).  They stop in for obligatory visits with relatives and for food (as we all do), receive an honourary degree (fame & success?), and then send the children off to a party held in our honour that we do not attend (funeral).  What happens along the way is important, but we always end up in the same place - the end. Wonderful editing techniques, good story, good images, fantastic acting, and more ideas and questions to ponder than one film can hold - or so you thought.  It's only after the film ends that these ponderings come to you. During the film, you simply watch a man travel from his home to another city, but this is far from what the film is about. See this film once, think about the questions it poses, then rewind and see it again.  You will be rewarded for doing so.",

            "content": "\u00a8 Wild strawberries\u00a8 is a spellbinding masterpiece by the great Ingmar Bergman with brilliant acting by Victor Sjostrom (Sweden first movie filmmaker and star , best known for his silent work , who died three years later , aged 81) and awesome cinematography by Gunnar Fischer ; showing a rich tapestry of fears , dreams , anxieties , memories and occasionally over-symbolic frames . This Bergman's landmark film is developed in Sweden , after living a life marked by coldness, an aging professor is forced to confront the emptiness of his existence , taking place a sentimental voyage . This the story about an aging scientist on the rout to accept a prize and he must come to terms with nightmares , surrealist dreams and guilt .The movie displays haunting and powerful scenes ,it's plenty of intellectual images which stay forever in the mind ; resulting to be one of Bergman's warmest and therefore finest movies . Brooding and thought-provoking screenplay , Ingmar Bergman wrote the script while he was in hospital and thought the movie with Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m in mind and riddled with a real feeling the joys of youth , age and nature . Although sometimes is slow moving ,however the thoughtful screenplay is narrated with intelligence and sensitivity but are developed ethics and moral issues as death , God , religion , family and aging . Surrealist and impressive images as when the coffin falling from the hearse , one of Bergman's own recurring dreams . Victor Sjostrom , Swedish cinema's best known pioneer and in his final screen appearance , gives a surprisingly moving interpretation as a professor on a touching journey to his redemption . The movie is marvelously paced and acted , and realizes an excellent Sweden reunion actors with usual Bergman's players (Ingrid Thulin , Bibi Andersson , Max Von Sidow as a gas station keeper and Gunner Lindblon, among others) , showing the different characters and exploring their apprehensions , ambitions, fears and circumstances . Glimmer and riveting cinematography by Gunner Fischer (The seventh seal) , he's deemed by many to be one of the world's greatest cameraman , he achieved give the movies on the most natural and simplest look imaginable . Cinematographer Gunnar Fischer says that several scenes had to be shot indoors due to Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m's poor health , \"We had to make some very bad back-projection in the car because we never knew if Victor would come back alive the next day.\" Gunnar was subsequently replaced by Sven Nykvist (won an Oscar for Fanny and Alexander) as Bergman's cinematographer . \u00a8Smultronst\u00e4llet\u00a8 is wonderfully directed by Bergman ,it's a real masterpiece who made his major impact gaining international acclaim and winning Gloden Globe 60 , for the best Foreign film . His realization was during an impressive golden period from 1957-1968 when Bergman made stunning masterpieces, plenty of richly observed characters : The seventh seal , Persona, The communicants , The silence , Virgin spring , Hour of wolf .

            "review_title": "A Magnificent Film",
            "content": "There are moments in Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries where you become so enthralled by an image that you want to dwell on it, until you realize that there are so many such moments that to do so would be to stop at practically every scene in the film. The sheer technical and visual skill that Bergman shows here is unsurprising, insofar as we ought to expect this from him, but it is dazzling, even when it is displayed in a film that, on the surface, has a rather tame premise. An old man, Professor Isak Borg (played to perfection by Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m), is driving to Lund, where he is to be honoured. His son's wife, and three spirited young people, two men and a woman, accompany him. They also pick up an utterly depressed couple along the way, only to drop them off when they begin to fight. Interspersed with the present actions are the old man's dreams, and flashbacks to his youth.Out of this material, Bergman crafts a wonderful and touching film about redemption. There is always a tendency to marvel at how an atheist like Bergman can be so deeply involved with religious issues, but many atheists, of course, are atheists precisely as a result of such deep involvement. I don't know enough about Bergman's views on religion to comment on his attitude towards God and religion beyond the basics. What is important, at any rate, is that this film is one in which an old man is redeemed from a miserably lonely and empty existence through contact with others. This is a deeply humanistic view of redemption, and one which is firmly grounded in reality.The film begins with the professor telling us that he has distanced himself from others, because he has shunned human relationships. This has left him feeling empty and alone. The man we see seems nice enough, until we learn from his son's wife, who speaks frankly to him, how this self-imposed exilic state has rendered him selfish and aloof. Through flashbacks and the dream sequences, we learn enough about his life to chart his progress: when young, the girl he loved, Sara, chose his brother over him. The professor married, but the marriage was a bad one; his wife cheated on him, but it apparently did nothing for him. To her, as she states in one of the dream sequences, he was \" cold as ice\". The professor, therefore, is old, lonely, and has an empty existence.How does one find oneself out of that miserable situation? There are three means through which the old man is redeemed. Firstly, the dream sequences serve to warn him of death, which, considering that the man is 78, could come any day. The dream sequences also point out to him just how detached he is from other human beings. In a fantastic scene, he is given a test, which he fails. The point is clear enough: he might be a professor and doctor, but that is nothing if he does not have an understanding of human beings, their emotions and feelings. Secondly, the flashbacks serve to remind him of a time when he was connected with others, as well as of times when he was disconnected from his wife and others. The beautiful scenes of his childhood are marvelously retold, with everyone well dressed in white, and the entire family engaging with each other. Only he is absent, standing in the dark at the threshold, an old man staring at the happy ghosts of the past mingling before him. Lastly, the three young people the professor meets, especially the wonderful Sonia, connect with him on a deeply emotional and innocent level. The girl looks like, and has the same name as, the Sonia who rejected the professor in favour of his brother when he was young. You can interpret this in any way you like, but I think it's obvious that we see here a kind of second chance. In the car, the professor asks Sonia which of the two young men she likes the most. She does not answer firmly. At the end of the film, as the three bid him goodbye, she tells the professor that she loves him the most of all. He brushes it off, but once he gets in bed, there is a great smile on his face. The smile no doubt is a reaction to the whole day's events, but I'm certain that one big reason for his happiness at the end is that Sonia finally chose him, after having rejected him so long ago.What is the overall message of this film? As with all great films, there is no one right answer. What is certain, however, is that Bergman gives us a view of the world that is neither wholly pessimistic nor wholly optimistic, because it is so painfully real. The characters in this film have been bruised. They are broken, and seek a way out of their situation. There is no indication in the film that Bergman suggests that a solution will solve all the problems. Rather, any change for the better can only come once we engage with the past. Through an understanding of our past and our self, we can add a new sense of our self to what the past given. If we can achieve that, through whatever means necessary, then we can be redeemed. In fact, that understanding of ourselves is itself a kind of redemption. Bergman's world is one in which hope is always possible. It can happen to an unsuspecting 78 year old man, and it can happen to us. It is never too late. Every day in our life is a new chance to make something better of ourselves.A+",

Ingmar Bergman's direction as ever is superb, there is a certain warmth to how he composes and conveys everything. Wild Strawberries looks gorgeous, it is beautifully shot with atmospheric lighting and scenery. It isn't a Bergman film either without memorable images, and Wild Strawberries has those certainly. Some people may find the symbolism of the nightmares with the handless clocks and runaway hearses somewhat overpowering, I didn't think so, I found them very haunting and even fascinating to watch. It is the more beautiful images where Wild Strawberries really drew me in, the memories of the idyllic summers are among Bergman's most beautiful and finest moments. The score fits perfectly, while the script is incredibly thought-provoking, and the story contrasts innocence with the expectancy of youth with bitterness with the regrets of old age very movingly. Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m is on magisterial form being both frosty and vain as his character seizes the chance for redemption. Overall, one of Bergman's finest, a wonderful film in all regards. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

But quickly the beautiful black and white photography caught my eye and I was drawn into Isak Borg's story, or rather, his self-examination.The progression of the film is fantastic. Early in the film, Isak has an apparition within a dream and the small events leading up to it, within the dream, are quite brilliant. Throughout the rest of the film there are dreams and recollections; newly discovered secrets of the past that Isak sees for the first time. As he says in the film, \"Dreams, as if I must tell myself something I won't listen to when I'm awake.\"How Bergman shows us the characters is terrific. It's a like a relaxed puzzle that doesn't emphasize any sort of urgency to figure things out. The story unfolds beautifully as we get a deeper sense of Isak, who I assume is an alter ago of Ingmar Bergman at that stage of his life (he was thirty-nine when the film was released).It pains me to know that the majority of people my age would rather watch an Adam Sandler movie or \"The Rock\" than something like this. Hey, I liked \"Big Daddy\" and I love Nicolas Cage, but \"Wild Strawberries\" is one of the few films I've seen that could possibly change the way I live my life. I'm always interested in listening to what aged people have to say about their own life because, well, it can only give me tips about my own, and that's what this film does in a way.There is one sequence in the film that is frightening and \"arty,\" and I don't completely grasp what it means beyond Isak's deterioration and his realization of how people actually feel towards him (he's told earlier in the film as well, but he seems to accept this \"verdict\" more readily), but it doesn't take away from the film; rather, it's an interesting addition to an otherwise satisfying experience. In fact, it's probably the most vital part of the movie -- Isak may not like it, bbut once he gets past it, he has the option to develop.I don't know if the film is a masterpiece -- it's my introduction to Bergman, so once I see \"Cries and Whispers,\" \"Fanny and Alexander,\" \"Persona\" and \"The Seventh Seal\" (if I can get through it, this time) I'll come back to this film with a new perspective, or at least see it as a part of Bergman's whole. I do think this is a great film of its type. It's the kind of film that may require viewings every five or so years, as a sort of reminder.Pauline Kael once said that she didn't think much of Bergman because she'd done her share of soul-wrestling and it wasn't that difficult. The film isn't as challenging as I was expecting it to be, in fact, it's a walk in the park. It's pleasant and rich and beautiful, and the title seems perfect after you've seen the film. It's all about wild strawberries.****",

He is friendly enough with other people, and he appears to be content with his relatively solitary existence. Anyway, Sara, the woman he loved when he was young, married his brother, and somehow that was Isak's fault, because he was cold and aloof. And Karin, the woman he ended up being married to, cuckolded him, but that was also Isak's fault, because he was cold and aloof. He visits his mother, who is cold and aloof. His son Evald is cold and aloof.I suppose the point is that he should have been warm and accessible, and then Sara would have married him and they would have lived happily ever after. Or Karin would have been faithful to him and they would have lived happily ever after. And they would have raised their son Evald to be warm and accessible, so that he and his wife Marianne could have lived happily ever after. And being warm and accessible, Evald would have been happy to hear that Marianne was pregnant, so that they would have a child of their own, whom they could raise to be warm and accessible.Having seen the error of his ways, Isak decides that he will henceforth become warm and accessible. Better late than never. So, he asks Agda, his maid of forty years, if she would like to be on a first-name basis. She rebuffs him.",

He worked primarily in the silent era; his best known films include \"The Phantom Carriage\" (1921), \"He Who Gets Slapped\" (1924) and \"The Wind\" (1928). Bergman said this film could not have been made without him, and it makes sense. Not only was Bergman influenced by these early Swedish films, but it makes sense to have a man at the end of his distinguished career.The real standout performance (besides Sjostrom) is Bibi Andersson, who plays Sara. Is it any surprise she starred in more than ten Bergman-directed pictures, including \"Smiles of a Summer's Night\", \"The Seventh Seal\", \"Brink of Life\", \"The Magician\", \"The Passion of Anna\", \"The Touch\" and \"Persona\". If Bergman had a muse, it was Andersson.Bergman has been a strong influence on Woody Allen, and \"Wild Strawberries\" has influenced a whole series of Allen films: \"Stardust Memories\", \"Another Woman\", \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\", and \"Deconstructing Harry\".

Of course there is much to look for, admire, and saturate with his tale of an old professor/doctor on his way to get a degree who looks back on his life, but the road trip scenes, while somewhat fascinating, can't hold a candle to the work that is displayed in the first dream. We see clocks with no hands (no time left for the old timer), a man with a very tightened face, and a coffin that falls right in front of the old man with himself inside of it, reflecting him. That this is one of Bergman's most evocative and powerful scenes goes to show why the film is so praised, and with the other dreams we see much insight into his fears and doubts on his life and what it's meant. But a number of the scenes go nowhere or ponder on events that slow the film down. Wild Strawberries is a film that can be judged as a display of perfect sorrow or longish observation, you decide. Plenty of beautiful outdoor scenery shots though; Max Von Sydow has a cameo as a gas station attendant. Grade: A.",

            "content": "As I look at all the 10 star reviews that others have given this film I wonder if I am being foolhardy in daring to say something to the contrary. I am and have been for many years a Bergman fan. I eagerly saw most of his films as they were released. I love nearly all of them - this one being an exception. Certainly the film is worth seeing - any Bergman film is. But this one is often cited as his best, and there I would strongly disagree. It is about an academic and although professor Borg has to face some of his demons, he comes out on top in then end. I understand why this film is so popular. Academics see themselves in professor Borg and academics have a lot of influence on what is considered art and what isn't. Borg ends up looking good at the end of the film, and academics, although they have their faults like anyone else, like to think that they are worthy of the respect that their position commands. In many, many cases they are - and this is not a diatribe against academics. I just think that Bergman let this character off too easily, particularly when you compare the way he treats his other characters in movies like \"The Hour of the Wolf\", \"The Silence\", \"Shame\" and so on. He plumbs the depths of the soul and takes no prisoners. \"Wild Strawberries\" starts out that way, when the professor flashes back to the key points in his life where he turned away from love, life and reality in favor of academic honor. But ultimately Bergman backs down. The professor, having seen the errors of a lifetime in a few short hours, is shown to be wiser and a better man now as he receives his honorary award. Bergman does not do this in his other films. For me this gives a certain falsity to \"Wild Strawberries\" that I don't see in \"Persona\" for example. Well, everyone will probably disagree with me, - this is such an acclaimed film - but sometimes it is valuable to hear a contrarian opinion even when you don't agree with it.",

Along the way he confronts the lack of success in his human relationships as opposed to the success he has enjoyed professionally. A string of encounters with the past and with iconic people he meets gradually bring the contrast into focus for the viewer.I particularly liked the subtle and intelligent storytelling in this film. He tells us before the credits that he is just a boring pedant. We realize as he comes to realize what this has really meant to him. We slowly receive hints of the emotional truths that frame the man's life. He is confronted by traces of how things could have been different.Important points are hinted at without being said--the viewer is left to sort them out. For example, the couple at the gas station convince us in a short and seemingly banal exchange that the Professor was a great healer whose service to those outside his family was anything but sterile. Yet speaking to his daughter-in-law, his smug insistence that a debt must be paid gives us a glimpse at what it must have been like for his son to have been held at emotional bay by bloodless, cold rationalism.This film deserves NOT to be remade, in order to preserve its artistic integrity.

The professor (doctor) made no \"bad choices\" in his life; no, the \"choice\" that cast a shadow on the professor's entire life was Sara's choice in loving the professor's brother and rejecting the professor. Sara was/is the girl He loved, the girl he will always love; with that light taken out of his life everything remaining is coldness; the quiet hell of living life in the absence of love; an infection that effects his wife, his son, but oddly not the people he served as a doctor. As the story progresses, the professor witnesses a much younger Sara and her two rival young men, an exact reflection of his own situation decades ago. As the loneliness generated the coldness in his life, the one radiant light was his quiet and close-guarded memory of the love he had for Sara, and in the final scene we watch the old man view paradise as he looks back on the time when Sara was still with him, with his family at a country get-together. What adds to the emotional wallop is the realization that the old man is Ingmar Bergman's projection of himself some 40 years hence, Bergman, a man loved by many beautiful women, yet he can see (and fear) the devastation which can destroy even a strong person if such person loses the spark of irreplaceable love. Immediately following this movie, I evaluated my own life; resolving drastic action to avoid (if possible) the pitfall Bergman warned us about with this powerful movie.",

The deceptively simple story introduces you to characters who are not wholly sympathetic, yet whom you cannot help but care about.  It shows their lives to be rather drab for the most part, yet it also brings out how important the events in their lives are to the characters themselves.The story of old Professor Borg driving across Sweden to attend a ceremony in his honor is complemented by just the right measure of dream sequences and flashbacks to his youth, which put the doctor's life into perspective and raise the questions that Bergman wants his viewers to think about.  The youthful memories, and the symbols they use, often strike an immediate chord whether you can personally relate to them or not.  The dreams are suitably weird without being overblown, and they are always pertinent.  All of this is a difficult balance to maintain, and Bergman had a masterful restraint that most film-makers lack, especially today.  He trusts his viewers to pay attention, and he wants the emphasis to remain on the important themes, where it should be, and not on cinematic artifice.  Of course, \"Wild Strawberries\" also benefits enormously from Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m's excellent lead performance, with considerable help from the rest of the cast as well.Since it has little action and little pretense, but much substance, this is the kind of movie that might never be widely popular.

Unfortunately, I was a little too wet behind the ears to have the proper appreciation. I am now retracing my steps and watching these films again, and now I'm seeing why they've withstood the test of time. This is a tremendous film with so much humanity and so much sadness. It's about all of us who have lived out lives a bit thoughtlessly. I think of Kurosawa's \"Ikiru\" as an example of the ultimate in that category. The good doctor has all he can do to make his way to receive an honorary degree. He brings along his daughter-in-law who really doesn't like him mostly because of what he has done to make his son a cynical, harsh man. He has been beset by dreams with faceless men and handless clocks, where time stands still. He is terrified. As we go along we realize that time often does heal and when we repress what really bothers, we flatten out the rough edges. On the long drive, human beings do what they often do. They begin to forgive and understand. If the doctor is an old inflexible being, it becomes obvious that he has had enough when his daughter-in-law levels with him. He begins to draw up his past for review. He sees that his basic sterility was as destructive as if he had been cruel. The deciding factor is a group of kids going to Italy. The travelers pick them up and their infectious youth begins to come to the fore. They begin to offer new insights to the two unhappy people. There is so much in this movie that I can't begin to tell all here. Let the real critics do that, but this is ultimately about how we need to forgive and forget and let life into us.

Although it's a close call, I'd say this is his overall best movie and is wonderfully, beautifully shot. It's tasteful, just the right running length (short enough not to contain any unnecessary scenes and long enough to feel satisfied when it's over).The point here -- underneath all the layers -- is that we don't have a very long time on earth, and we should make the most out of it. Borg realizes as a frail old man that he has ruined his own life and has no happy memories.It is Bergman's \"Citizen Kane\" or \"Ikiru\" -- a poignant reflection on humanity and a film that, ultimately, can change the way you look at life -- if you open up enough to let it.",

            "content": "Bergman's films, to state the blindingly obvious, are the complete antithesis of the mindcandy (A Beautiful Mind) presented to cinemagoers in sterile multiplexes. They are almost like cinematic art forms, meditations on life and its meanings but, like many works of art, they can be obscure, challenging and demand patience to understand their underlying subtexts. Even after a 2nd viewing!'Wild Strawberries' deals with the past, memories & regrets. It's about an inner journey about one man's subjective state of mind as he sees nostalgic memories of childhood & lost love (regret), surreal visions of denial (mortality) and unsettling weird dreams which hint at a self-awareness and truth that he cannot face in reality.I was touched by Victor Sjostrom's performance as the elderly Prof. Isak Borg reflecting upon his life, and moved by the final emotional scenes where he achieves an inner peace. Is it slightly deceiving, a cop-out that Borg finds peace at the sight of his father and mother, 'the point before betrayal, before the messiness of life' intervenes as another reviewer stated? Well, I think it's commonly accepted that most people, as they grow older, tend to remember more from their past & childhoods. Why? Perhaps because it reminds them of a time of lost innocence.What I found quite difficult to understand was how Isak is supposed to be this cold-hearted rationalist; Sjostrom's touching depiction makes this troubled old man quite endearing (viz the young travelling companions affection for him). Perhaps, as the opening suggests, this is a man who has shied away from intimate contact, whose coldness drove his unhappy late wife into the arms of another and who has approached life solely on his own (egotistic) terms leading to loneliness.This is where the allusion to wild strawberries becomes significant as it is the symbol of regeneration: through his inner journey, mixing dream & reality, Borg sees the truth about his life and its emptiness. The film charts his growing intimacy with his daughter-in-law and an eventual inner peace.The film sounds typically Scandinavian in its gloom but it is also a celebration of youth as well as a study of mortality and one man's mind. It's also not without comedy, particularly the old Prof's relationship with his housekeeper Agfa and the absurd boxing match about 'God'(Bergman parodying himself) between the two young hitchhikers.What makes the film so intriguing is how characters/situations often reflect one another (Borg & his son, their coldness and attitude to life); these parallels extend to the point where characters even play dual roles: Bibi Andersson as Sara (the lost love & then the young vivacious traveller) and a cruel husband who later appears as the stern examiner in an unsettling dream. It's a highly complex pattern of subtle connections (stream of consciousness)that, as Borg states at the end, forms some sort of logical order.\n....................................................................................................................2021 addition. I recently heard Charles Causley's poem 'Eden Rock' which is about the older poet encountering his parents as he remembers them when young, and they beckon him to cross the drifting stream (the passage between life & death).'Crossing is not as hard as you might think.\"I'm not sure I understand all the meanings in this film, but feel the above poem illuminates the final scene of the film, perhaps with the old Professor coming to terms with his life & mortality.",

            "content": "This is still one of Bergman\u2019s finest and, actually, it seems to me that the film improves with each viewing. It was certainly an inspired choice to cast elderly ex-director Victor Sjostrom in the lead, while the main female roles are filled by the luscious Ingrid Thulin (here in one of her best showcases) and a radiant Bibi Andersson (in two roles no less, both named Sara!). Other important members of Bergman\u2019s stock company of actors appear in bit-parts: even Gunnar Bjornstrand in the pivotal role of Sjostrom\u2019s son and Thulin\u2019s husband is only in a couple of scenes; a blonde Gunnel Lindblom plays Andersson\u2019s sister (during Sjostrom\u2019s recollections); and, most incongruously, Max von Sydow turns up as a gas-station owner grateful to doctor Sjostrom for services rendered in the past!WILD STRAWBERRIES also features two of cinema\u2019s most unforgettable dream sequences \u2013 Sjostrom\u2019s character meeting his own corpse while walking a deserted city street and, later, his humiliating exam for a doctor\u2019s degree (by and in front of the people he met during the day\u2019s journey on the way to picking up an award for his distinguished career). The film presents a simple but eventful, episodic narrative that is brimming with reflections and insights about family, love and duty; invariably, these have marked the personality of the protagonist (rendered somewhat cold by regrets and disappointments) and now lead to either reconciliation or resignation on his part with his earlier life \u2013 it\u2019s as if Bergman was doing his own version of \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d!As usual, spirituality (the eternal debate on the existence of God) is touched upon here via semi-humorous incidents \u2013 a bickering middle-aged couple and two young students (both in love with the second character played by Andersson) who determine to settle the argument with a fistfight! By the way, in earlier viewings of WILD STRAWBERRIES, I used to resent Bergman\u2019s rather contemptuous depiction of the twins (being one myself, I can attest to the fact that such siblings don\u2019t speak in unison as depicted here \u2013 though it happens on occasion, for instance, that my brother and I discover to have shared parallel thoughts!); thankfully, however, the two characters\u2019 participation in the film doesn\u2019t last for very long.",

It is uneven, with gaps between the most spectacular and meaningful sequences, however the film certainly has enough in it to rate as a great film. Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m is excellent as the old man reflecting on his past and trying to sort out his emotions, and the camera-work is simply beautiful. The (too few) nightmarish dream segments are very well done: surreal and quite frightening to a degree. The film pushes the boundaries with some aspects though, such as how the protagonist is able to remember events that he never witnessed himself, and a time factor that can only be discussed in light of events that happen towards the end of the film. There a small number of things that one can quibble about here, but the overall film stands up strong. It is relatively pleasant, quite well acted, and the bits that are done well are done very well.",

            "content": "Smultronstallet/Wild Strawberries(1957) features a prestigous professor whose memories of his youth become precious as he comes closer to the end of his life.  Memories are important for Bergman's film protagonists because of a personal desire to return to happier days.  Ingmar Bergman was interested in his own youthful memories which are loosely injected into the youthful memories of Professor Isak Borg.  Memories of Professor Borg are intergrated into his dreams to create a time period both unreal and filled with life moments that can never return.\nDreams are portrayed in Wild Strawberries(1957) as segments of childhood for the Professor.  Early dreams of Professor Borg involve childhood love for an older cousin.  The young woman who is his cousin seems to represent an unattainable love which has eluded the Professor his entire life. Professor's memories of his favorite cousin are the film's main tender moments.\nLight hearted Bergman fare compared to films, The 7th Seal(1957) and The Virgin Spring(1959).  Ingmar Bergman presents the past as a time of innocence before the faults of old age begin to creep in.  Professor Borg is in a way as seen now a stand-in for Ingmar Bergman because like Bergman, Professor Borg is well known for his achievements.  Ingmar Bergman's five masterpieces are Persona(1966), Cries & Whispers(1972), Wild Strawberries(1957), Seventh Seal(1957), and Fanny & Alexander(1982).\nA heartfelt performance by Victor Sjostrom as a prestigious professor who looks back on his early life with nostalgia.  Wild Strawberries(1957) is one of the few times in the Ingmar Bergman filmography to see an important male lead.  Victor Sjostrom's performance is a good as the best of Max Von Sydow in an Ingmar Bergman film.  The performances from the rest of the actors are very good as a whole.\nWild Strawberrie's mis-en-scene moves with amazing imagery to capture the director's personal themes.  Dreams and surreal moments are always soul searchful in the films of Ingmar Bergman.  Ingmar Bergman is the Sweedish equivant of Luis Bunuel and Federico Fellini.  Ingmar Bergman directs with a perfectionist dedication that is definitely typical of a master film director.\nRare Bergman film which wasn't photographed by Sven Nykvist.  Wild Strawberries(1957) does not suffer from the absense of Sven Nykvist because of the marvelous cinematography by Gunnar Fischer.  Wild Strawberries(1957) is an excellent photographed film which is the norm for a Ingmar Bergman film.  Whether by Nykvist or someone else, the cinematography in Bergman's films are for the most part in top form.\nExcellent in every area of film that constitutes a masterpiece.  Strengths are in acting, imagery, montage, etc.  Dream sequences are portrayed in the manner of a memoir.  A viewer must have a degree of patience when watching an Ingmar Bergman film because of their slow moving nature.\nWild Strawberries(1957) also deals with the Professor's fond memories of his parents which are shown in his dreams.  These dreams which involve his parents signify Professor Borg's desire to return to a time that is lost and exists only in memories.  Seems like the professor's relationship with his parents had a strong effect on him when he first became a parent himself. The final dream sequence marks an escape for the professor from the dreads of old age and death.\nMax Von Sydow has a rare small supporting role as Henrik Akerman.  Bibi Anderrson as always in an Ingmar Bergman pic performs nicely as a young woman, the professor meets on his way to his tribute.  Wild Strawberries(1957) is a cinematic classic without being flashy or starstruck.  Title refers to the nature of Professor's inner thoughts and desires.\nWild Strawberries(1957) also focuses on the theme of death and looking back as death is near at hand.  Its with this aspect of the story that Wild Strawberries(1957) shares many common qualities with Seventh Seal(1957). Professor Borg comes to term with past behaviors and events as his time is about to come to a close.  Bitter sweet motion picture that strikes at the core emotions of an audience.",

            "content": "Ingmar Bergman's WILD STRAWBERRIES, on the Criterion DVD version, is nothing short of stunning. Picture, sound and English Subtitles have never been as fine as seen here. Having viewed this 1957 film during its first U.S. release in 1959, when I was 21 years-old, it was quite involving to return to it 43 years later. Like the Professor of the story, I too often reflect upon choice made along lifes path and wonder what might have been if different choices had been made. Victor Sjostron as Proffesor Isak Borg gives the performance of a life-time! What a magnificent face this man had! Bergman films can be quite dark and depressing, but his THE SEVENTH SEAL and WILD STRAWBERRIES are marvelous, thought-provoking dramas that lift the spirit. BEWARE: There are two other DVD releases, one from Asia and one from Brazil -- but neither of these have been cleaned up like the Criterion version. The sound for instance -- I have seen the dream sequence at the beginning of the film when the Professor walks through empty streets, sees handless clocks, a carriage carrying a casket with his body -- a scene with almost complete silence,BUT prints on 16mm, VHS and even Laser Disc all contain a great deal of surface noise. In the Criterion version, the silence is almost complete. And the picture is perfection -- blacks & whites that sparkle and no film blemishes or dirt-- a picture that is a wonder to behold. Peter Cowie's Commentary is outstanding and very worth while. The 90 Documentary from Swedish Television, INGMAR BERGMAN ON LIFE AND WORK is quite fascinating. Bergman, then in his early 80's, is very articulate and thoughtful in his discussion. Over the years Bergman has come to the conclusion that when we die we are no more -- and he has stated that conclusion gives him great peace. BUT his conversation in this documentary puts a wrinkle in his conclusion. He speaks of his final marriage to a woman for over 20 years and of her passing. He can not believe that SHE does not exist anymore. He often has the feeling that she is near him and that she still influences decisions he makes. He can accept not being for himself but not for her. Bergman is getting closer to the truth then he realizes. . . death is not the end -- but only the beginning. When he finally passes from this early life and finds that he still \"is\" -- I wonder if he'll wish he could change the focus of his later film work. Be that as it may -- WILD STRAWBERRIES and THE SEVENTH SEAL are two of the finest films of the last century -- in my humble opinion.",

            "content": "... because Dr. Isak Borg, apparently both an M.D. and a professor, is extremely self-aware. In the opening minutes of the film he admits he has allowed himself to become isolated from others and declares that his most annoying characteristics are being a pedant and thinking that women should not be allowed to smoke in the car. He has one son, also a doctor, and his wife Karen has been dead for many years.Professor Borg is supposed to get an honorary degree in Lund that evening, and after waking from a horrifying dream that seems to be about death and loss of identity that only Ingmar Bergman could cook up, decides at 3AM to drive his car rather than fly as originally planned. His housekeeper of 40 years has a fit and he teases her that she is carrying on like a wife. In spite of the early hour his only son's wife, who is staying with him, asks to come along too.So off they go at dawn for the long drive up the coast. In fact, I found Professor Borg to be a good guy. His daughter-in-law, who is his guest, talks about how ruthless he is. I'm sorry I just don't see it. When they stop at a gas station the young attendant talks about how Borg is still remembered from decades before when he was a physician there and insists on paying for his gas. Borg cheerfully invites a young girl named Sara and her two male companions to ride with them as far as Lund - they are going to Italy together. When the group is sideswiped by a couple, Borg invites them to ride with them. It is only because the husband berates his wife to the point that she hits him repeatedly that they are asked to leave, and then it is the daughter in law who does the asking.Borg makes various stops. He stops at his summer home as a child and revisits, not a memory, but an episode he could not have seen or heard because he was elsewhere at the time, between his first and true love Sarah and his brother Sigfrid, as he tries to steal her away from Isak with some bold physical behavior and must have won, because the two went on to marry and have six children. Yet, Borg does not seem angry. Instead you see a trace of a smile and nostalgia on his face, especially when he sees Sara in tears talking to her cousin about Isak's sweetness versus Sigfrid's physicality and how she is horrified that she is attracted to the latter. This is really the only pleasant dream/daydream/memory of the several along the way. In the end I figured that the young girl and her two struggling paramours are probably signifying Isak, Sigfrid, and Sara in his youth, and the feuding couple probably represents Borg's own unhappy marriage in which, after seeing how he felt about Sara and how he must have felt losing her to his own rather boorish brother, the wife could not have helped but feel like anything but the back up plan. Isak and Karin had only the one child, their son, compared to Sigfrid's six. His own son, married for many years, has none. It's like Bergman is equating fertility to connectivity, not just to a spouse, but to people in general. In the end, it's not like Isak Borg was a bad person who redeems himself because of all of these dreams and touches with the distant past, but he does seem more at peace with his past as he readies for bed that night.I'd highly recommend it. I'm no expert on Swedish cinema or Bergman at all, but I thought it was interesting how Bergman seems to be saying that Borg's \"wrong turn\", if there was any at all, could be traced back to losing his first and true love to his own brother, and that everything after that just fed off of that disappointment. As I look back on my life, I think that I can agree with that assessment.And now a word about the daughter-in-law. She accuses Isak of having said some just horrible things. Things he does not remember saying and things the audience never hears. Perhaps she wants to blame her husband's bleak and icy behavior on someone and Isak is convenient? At any rate, by journey's end she has warmed to Isak enough to confide in him about a great turmoil in her marriage. This was more of a change in her than any change I saw in Isak. This one is really worth a look, even if you normally aren't into foreign film. My review is just my take on the plot. I'm sure it means many things to many people or we wouldn't still be discussing and watching it 60 years later.",

Surrealist instances and magic realism make 'Wild Strawberries' lighter and at least as memorable as 'the Seventh Seal', which was made in the same year.  As a fan of Luis Bunuel I think I can say that Bunuel must have liked these two masterpieces, although here is less humour and less shocking moments than in any of his own films and Bunuel hated family values.  But we already knew from Swedish people that they have less temperament than the Spanish.Victor Sjostrom and 'The Wind' (1928) have been mentioned, so I will not do that again here, but cinematographer Gunnar Fischer was a also a crucial mind behind the success of this film which is at least visually unforgettable and a directorial milestone.  The screenplay of the Seventh Seal is obviously superior, but also a bit more heavy-handed than this eclectic film.Is a honorary degree more important than family memories or family values? What do you learn from life if you spend it studying it?  These are the questions that I would like to ask many academics by recommending to them this film.  After all, questions are more important than answers.  Sokrates said it, and a certain Ingmar Bergman too.10 points out of 10 :-)",

            "content": "Ingmar Bergman is the quintessential, existential filmmaker. To me, he is the black angel of cinematic death, and please, I mean that in the best way possible. He's most famous for attempting to answer the questions that all of us want answered. What is the meaning of life? What happens when we die? Is there a god? Is there a heaven or a hell? Bergman is always asking these questions in his film, and always, does he find interesting answers and hypothesis formed by these questions. He uses his actors and his framing abilities to help drive home the main idea of these films, and thus, his movies are notoriously not very hard to understand. Most importantly, he has an ability to make us understand the answers, and to help us understand ourselves. Bergman is an introspective filmmaker by definition, and because of that, his films have become so cherished and remembered for being so. In a period slightly before his heyday, no film makes a better example of his unique cinematic mission than \"Wild Strawberries\"\"Wild Strawberries\" focuses on an elderly professor, Dr. Isak Borg, who lives by himself with his common-law wife in Stockholm. After a lifelong journey of achieving greatness in himself and academia, he has been invited to Lund University to receive an honorary degree. He gets in a car with his daughter-in-law, Marianne, and together they travel to Lund. Through the travel, Isak is haunted by his own thoughts and dreams that have accumulated after years of isolation and reflection. At the not-so-ripe age of 78, Isak want's to understand what led him to this strange point of his life, where he went wrong, and what on Earth will happen next? He is remembered of the place of his childhood, where the wild strawberries grew. A time when he romanced his young, beautiful cousin, Sara, before being stolen from him by his older, arrogant brother Sigfrid. Before going on the trip, he has a vivid, terrible nightmare of being old, as a dead body follows him through a city street and a hearse crashed in front of him, revealing a clone of himself in a casket. Through the ways of the trip, and through the hitchhikers he meets along the way, his mind keeps racing and the dreams of his past and future keep following him. The journey becomes so strenuous and visceral to his memory, that by the time he arrives at his destination, his psyche is entirely cleansed, and he is greeted with the memory of a peaceful fishing trip with his family. What Bergman is doing here is experimenting with time and space, through memory and reflection. His style reminds me of \"Hiroshima Mon-Amour\", considering that there is no clear pattern between what happens in the moment, and what happens in the past. Bergman is giving us a deconstructed narrative that in essence, gives us a clear indication of the kind of crisis that Isak is going through. As a man that has been through everything and nothing, his mind is racing, much like our own, of scenarios that did and didn't happen. This is quite an interesting introspective device that Bergman uses. He is making movies about people, the exact way that we think about each other. Bergman typically uses characters that wrestle with their own identity, and bravely ask questions that might have no answers. Thus, it doesn't take much interpretation of the audience to understand, because all of the questions and answers are presented on screen. \"Wild Strawberries\" is a very entertaining, beautiful piece to that effect. The entire time, I was haunted, confused, and rightfully engaged with Isak and the characters he meets. My favorite scene of the film is the nightmare at the beginning. The surrealism of this section is frightening and so wonderfully imaginative. I loved the giant eyeglasses that appeared over his head, as well as the dead man with no face that appears to him in the middle of the street. Bergman was really experimenting with some wonderful visual concepts, especially for the 1950's. I thought the acting, was also very real and interesting to watch. Bergman was always known to be a director for actors, and in this film especially, he makes his actors play these characters as real people, not merely as stage personas. What we get because of that is a real, frightening portrayal of an older man, and seeing that alone is fascinating. In conclusion, \"Wild Strawberries\" is a dark and interesting classic about the struggle of understanding our fate, and without question, it should regarded as one of the great films of Ingmar Bergman.",

            "content": "In Ingmar Berman's film masterpiece Smultronstallet (or \u0091Wild Strawberries' B&W, 1957), the protagonist, an elderly professor who is facing death, has to come to face to face with a long life that has failed to answer the important questions. He is old now and faced with his own inadequacy and impotence.Bergman introduces three young people into the drama to introduce life's most important question \u0096 that of the existence of God. The old man gives them a ride. One of the young men is thinking about becoming a parson; the other argues that God doesn't exist. The old man offers no opinion to the debate. He is silent, but it is a loud silence. It's a silence that reveals an amazing dimension of loss \u0096 the loss of year upon year of not coming to terms with this all-important question.In one of the final scenes, Bergman masterfully closes in tight on the aged face of Professor Isak Borg (played by Victor Sjostrom). In that shot, we can see the whole universe in his eyes and all of its cares in the bags beneath them. Only Bergman could have directed that scene \u0096 only him. It makes Smultronstallet one of the most important films ever made. That one scene, better than any other that I know, captures \u0091loss' on celluloid for all future generations to witness. If you see it, you may find yourself having to look away.The imagery in Smultronstallet is unparalleled, except by Bergman's own Sjunde inseglrt, Det (The Seventh Seal, 1957). Look for the handless watch, the corpse wagon, the sparseness of the first scene, the car windows turning to black \u0096 ominous signs are everywhere. Notice the clues that point to Bergman's existential philosophy (the twins write a song for a deaf man \u0096 as futile as Sisyphus' labor!) and the redemption themes (Izak pierces his hand as he looks into the window, or the line: `A doctor's first duty is to ask for forgiveness.'). Notice also the outright defiance of the divine presence that he has bred into his son (`I will not be forced to live one day longer than I want to.').Izak is ready to die, but it seems that, for him, life is more forbidding than death. He is a living corpse, dead already in nearly every way. All of these factors conspire to create a masterwork of pure art, and one that gets richer with each repeated viewing.The film is also cathartic in the sense that Greek drama was cathartic \u0096 a warning to the men of ancient Greece to avoid the tragic flaw that undoes the hero - and may be a fateful knock on the door of your undoing as well. Have we answered the question that Izak has not? If not, Izak is us. Look hard - very hard - at Izak. Do you like what you see? To quote a line from the film: `Is there no mercy?' `Don't ask me.' I hope that all of us will fare better when confronted with the film's important question.",

            "content": "Ingmer Bergman's films are usually about what's happening inside the mind of a character, rather than in the outside world, and Wild Strawberries is a classic of the genre. The story in the conventional sense is almost nonexistent, and I have no qualms about spilling whatever there is. In any case, it's only my version of the story. A 78-year old doctor is to be honored on the 50th anniversary of his graduation from the university. The old man's day is normally filled either recalling his dreams while asleep, most of them he is unable to comprehend, or day-dreaming about the girl he loved in his youth, who ditched him to marry his brother. It's no different on the day of coronation, when he is traveling to the university accompanied by his daughter-in-law, estranged from his son. Significantly, he never day-dreams about his wife he lived with till her death. Occasionally, when she does appear in his dreams, he is guilt-ridden to find himself devoid of any feelings for her other than lust. During the journey, his daughter-in-law confides in him, that his 38-year old son is cold, detached, selfish and vainly principled - traits she observes in him as well as his 95-year old mother they meet on the way. The old man has loaned an undisclosed sum of money to his son, and in spite of son desperately needing money, and old man having no use for it, both father and son insist on returning the money as a matter of principle. Although feeling sorry for his son not enjoying life in his prime, just like himself, he feels himself absolved of any guilt feelings - it's in the genes - and goes back to day-dreaming of the girl he loved but lost. It's a film pleasing to the senses - B&W cinematography is exceptionally beautiful, the background score is haunting and nostalgic. As a character study of old age, it's pioneering. Ingmer Bergman is one of the purists of the cinema, who has not compromised the least bit in any of his movies. He, along with few others notably Robert Bresson and Werner Herzog, has made cinema the art form within 100 years of its origin. Bergman's Wild Strawberries (and Seventh Seal) are among the gems.",

            "content": "An aging professor of bacterium embarks upon a day's journey from Stockholm to Lundsk to receive an honourary award for his career work. The night before, he has a Bunuel-esque nightmare that foreshadows his own fate, seeing a watch with no hands, and his own corpse in a coffin. Cleverly, the film hints that he may be out of time before his own mortality claims him, and thus he begins a journey of self discovery where his skeletons reach out from the closet.For my first Bergman film, I was impressed by the crisp presentation and cerebral story. Its not often that filmmakers explore the aging process in sympathetic ways, and this is helped by the characterization of Dr. Isak Borg as an every man which makes him easier to relate to. He's a successful academic, although happiness in his personal life was sacrificed for concentration on his profession. And so Dr. Borg asks the eternal question of whether his existence has had any significance at all. Along the road trip with his daughter in law Marianne (who resents his emotional distancing), they pick up passengers that each represent and harken back to the failures of Borg's past. An old bickering couple that remind him of his unhappy marriage, and a love triangle between two men and a girl who symbolize a lost love from his adolescence. As the memories come flooding back, the old doctor descends into his recollections and subconscious dreams, where suppressed issues come hurtling forth from the depths. His clinical nature and lack of interest in relationships led to his first love leaving him for his brother, and later his wife having a bastard child with another man, who Borg still raised as his own. There is a haunting scene where he takes Marianne to visit his lonely, decrepit mother, and there the audience realizes along with her that this lack of zest for life seems to run through the family; Isak's son is too revealed to be a misanthropic bore, who rejects his wife Marianne's request for a child. The result of his resentfulness at having been raised as an unwanted child himself.The doctor soon learns that the only good he ever accomplished was tied to his medicinal work, but at the cost of living a life of solitude and isolation, a mindset that has afflicted his own son. There is a subtle theme from Bergman that Borg's ignorance of his family and friends has been the result of his turning away from God, as hinted by the young men they pick up (a minister and a doctor, the two sides of Isak's psyche) who fight and debate over its existence. No real answer is given in the end, symbolized by the men's stalemate in the argument. But as said later in the film: \"a doctor's first duty is forgiveness.\" It seems the first step to even beginning to comprehend the question is by forgiving the flaws of those around you and the ones within. And although Borg fears he may be too late to reconcile the animosity between him and his family, the film makes an inspiring statement by the end that it's never never too late to redeem oneself and begin enjoying life. The story is resolved, and the generational cycle of resentment broken, with the rapprochement between two lovers and the potential birth of new life.Alas, there are flaws in Bergman's work that cannot be forgiven, and he was no God. The first major flashback acts as a crux of the plot, but appears contrived due to Isak being present for an event that was impossible for him to have known. Nor do we ever get to really see this \"cold distance\" that Isak possessed as a man; only its effects. The director is to be commended for not spoon feeding the audience the philosophical aspects (this is an art film from Sweden after all), but sometimes his high brow obscurity gets in the way of my enjoyment of the story. It's all a little too esoteric for me. While the message may seem a little trite and simplistic at times, this is still a heartwarming and life-affirming fable from a legendary auteur. \"Wild Strawberries\" has a comforting aura, although like Doctor Isak Borg himself, the film can be rather too pedantic for its own good.",

I can trust some artists to work their magic to change me in ways that I admire or even like. But I have to be very careful with Bergman: his primary concern is often himself, which immediately worries me. And his method is extreme in the engineering of the presentation, with the focus being an exploration of that very compulsion. The art is more than earnest, it is obsessive in attention to detail, and that obsession is possibly near the brink of madness -- the kind of madness that is contagious.I do not accept this film, but warmly embrace 'The Seventh Seal,' made at the same time, with many of the same sensibilities. But 'Seal' was about the nature of constructed memory in the context of film and general myth. 'Strawberries' substitutes personal experience for the fabric of art and myth, so the constructed memories all have emotional consequence. Odd how he swings. Be careful with this one.The DVD contains an interview with Bergman. Unlike nearly all such filler, this one is valuable.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",

            "content": "For us seasoned film viewers, a film like \"Wild Strawberries\" carries some resonance. It invites both a retrospective and introspective look into one's own life with all it's triumphs along with the disappointments, lost loves and unfinished business that are a part of that sometimes undisciplined thing called life. If done honestly, as in the case of Dr. Isak Borg (Victor Sjostrom), the look back may dredge up moments of recrimination and a wish that things had been done differently. Borg's memories are further haunted by strange dreams that summon up things like empty streets, ruined buildings and faceless men; the horse drawn hearse spilling it's coffin to reveal his own corpse is a precursor to a later dream in which a judge pronounces him guilty of incompetence, callous behavior, selfishness and a ruthlessness as cold as ice. Borg begins to see and understand that his behavior throughout life has also infected those very close to him, including a distant son who lives to carry on his father's traits. Through chance encounters with hitchhikers on the way to picking up an honorary degree, and an unplanned reconciliation with his daughter-in-law, Borg seeks redemption for some of those inadequacies before he's called upon to meet his Maker. Though the film closes on an optimistic note with Borg's dream of his father and mother waving to him on a sunlit beach, it's really up to the viewer to decide if the good Doctor has attained peace with his past. His reflective journey may have planted a seed of humanity in the man's heart, just as the picture challenges the viewer to contemplate one's own life and legacy.",

I don't think multitalented covers it. His acting, as his directing, is magnificent.Here he is Professor Isak Borg, a man about to get a prestigious award. As he contemplates his life, however, he has strange dreams. As he talks to his daughter-in-law (Ingrid Thulin), he realizes that the only difference between his life and death is the coffin. In choosing a lonely, cutoff existence and a life of cold detachment, Borg realizes that he is already dead.This sounds like depressing Bergman, but in fact, Isak learns something as he travels to get his award. Along the way, he and his daughter-in-law Marianne agree to give a ride to some young people, two boys and a girl named Sara, which is the name of Isak's first love, his cousin. Like the woman he loved, Sara is being sought after by both boys, and she flirts with each one. In Isak's life, his Sara fell for his brother. The situation brings back Isak's childhood to him, and he relives family experiences when he visits his old home and later, his 96-year-old mother and sees her own coldness.Isak and Marianne also give a ride to a married couple whose car has broken down. But their fighting is reminiscent of Isak's own marriage (and Marianne's to Isak's son, too, for that matter), and Marianne asks them to get out of the car.\"Wild Strawberries,\" referring to the strawberries that grew on the land of Isak's family home, is the story of a man coming to grips with his life - a life full of accomplishment but not many human connections.The most striking thing about this black and white film is the cinematography - the starkness of Isak's dreams, the family all in white against the Swedish landscape - so many stunning images.People call this film optimistic and uplifting, and it is. It is also profound, emotional, and very warm. Sjostrom shows us a charming old man whose niceness is on the surface only. While Marianne says that she doesn't like him very much, the young people love him and buy into his facade because they sense the real man he is afraid to show others.Bergman tells us that life's questions aren't answered right away - sometimes, it takes a lifetime.",

Bergman's achievement to tell a heartfelt story with a very human message juxtaposed with image after image of stunning beauty is something so rare and so very remarkable. I wont go into a deep analysis of this beautiful masterpiece, as many other users on here have done so. All I will do is simply describe one of the films most lyrically sublime scenes. Near the end of the film, as Isak Borg lies in bed, his son asks him how his heart is (meaning his physical health). Being a doctor of considerable talent and having a tradition of being practical and sensible in his work, you would expect him to tell his son of his failing health. However after his subsequent journey, both physical and spiritual, his attentions are now turned toward his emotional and spiritual well being, a part of himself he has neglected for many years. He simply replies that his heart is fine, and that he is happy and content. In this single moment, we understand that Isak has reached a moment of catharsis, but it also tells us something about every one of us. We strive constantly for physical wealth and materialistic products of our lives and jobs, but we must remember the simple but extremely rewarding pleasures that determine the happiest of individuals.",

            "content": "This is a film school movie; one of the greatest ever made, or so say the experts. I was told to read the play (The English title is \"Wild Strawberries\") in a lit class in college and then we were given the chance to see the film. I watched both showings and it changed my thinking about what makes a good movie. This was in the stone age back in '75. I was a wild boy about campus who's taste for films was more action/adventure, western and mystery/suspense. The funny thing about Wild Strawberries is there's a little of all those genre's in it (if you understand what a cowboy Bergmann was at this point in his career).This is the story about the late-life introspection of an elderly physician. It really appears on the surface to be about as dull a concept for a film as one could ever want to suffer through. But this is a story about facing reality, and reality is rarely dull. The plot moves seamlessly through many phases, but much of it involves a road trip through the Swedish countryside.I recently bought a DVD of the 70's cult car-chase flick \"Vanishing Point\"; I hadn't seen it since the drive-in in my college years. I also own a Criterion Collection copy of Wild Strawberries and I've watched both recently. I realized that Wild Strawberries is a car chase flick as well. But Bergmann's Isak is not running from war weariness but from a life of nihilism cloaked in the old-world respectability of a family doctor. The chase is his lifetime of self-certainty, agnosticism and increasing isolation finally catching up to him. He realizes that he has been a walking dead man for much of his life (something he partially inherited from his mother). Getting too far into the details may fall into the category of being a spoiler, although there is enough complexity in this plot to keep literature classes struggling for an A for a long time (note: the stage play script is exactly the same as the screenplay script).There are a number of notable scenes in the movie that make this day a turning point in the life of the doctor. The ground-breaking dream sequences in the beginning is Hitchcock-like and terrifyingly surreal (or is Hitch being Bergmannesque?). Of great beauty is the reverie scene, where Isak relives some of his childhood while making a stop at his families' deserted summer lake house. The dialog scenes between Isak and his daughter-in-law, and later with the Almans (including another disturbing dream sequence) and with the \"children\" (hitchhiking college-age kids) are all filled with symbols and conversation pointing to Isak's living-dead existence.It's interesting that Bergmann himself, at this point in his young career, was much like Isak; agnostic, distant, self-absorbed, incapable of intimacy. Yet his conclusion to Wild Strawberries is much more hopeful than what Bergmann's own life has been.The turning point of the movie, easy to miss if you're not paying close attention, is the love-promise from the young hitchhiker Sara; a moment of incredible sweetness and innocent passion that is a regeneration, a salvation experience for Isak. Unlike Bergmann, Isak closes his eyes that night with the hope of a life of meaning, of love in service, not just service for maintaining personal dignity and image. Unlike Bergmann, Isak has a hope of seeing God when his death does arrive, and has demonstrated a new life has begun. This is Isak's Today; his day of repentance, of stopping the tortuous task of hardening his heart against the call of life, yielding in submission to love, mercy and grace.Watch this one several times. Bergmann's troupe of actors are incredible, his cinematography is spartan and overwhelmingly effective; his location shooting in the beautiful Swedish summer is fascinatingly effective in giving a foreign yet \"down-home\" feeling that's almost Mayberry like, if that's not too extreme a comparison.This movie shows the dichotomy of living for self versus living for the service of others. Isak thought he lived to serve but discovered that service is only of meaning to the server if it is from the heart. It is ultimately a hopeful picture that we can all learn from if we watch with an open heart. Otherwise, we see the wasted tragedy of existential living with no greater good than one's own dead image. Does YOUR watch have any hands?",

From that day to today it has been in my top five films of all time and one that I watch over and over again.Everything works in what I consider to be director Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece.  The story is simple, though so loaded with meaning and symbolism that it can be dissected frame by frame.  Isak Borg, an old doctor and teacher living in Stockholm, Sweden is to be honored for a lifetime of work, in Lund, a Cathedral town many miles away.  After waking from a terrible nightmare in which he envisions his own mortality, Borg decided to drive to Lund, taking his daughter in law, who has been staying with him, as she is estranged from Borg's son Evald, with him.  The journey, which takes up the major part of the film, is one of self revelation as Borg slips back and forth in time in his dreams, and faces the stark reality of the cold, impersonal person he has become. Only at the end of his journey, is there redemption.The cast is flawless with the luminous Ingrid Thulin as the daughter in law, and Bibi Anderson in a dual role as Sara, the girl Borg wanted to marry and Sara, a hitchhiking youngster, who helps in Borg dealing with understanding his loss.  But is famed director Victor Sjostrom as Borg that stays forever in your mind. (Indeed, the second to last close up of him in the film, has to be one of film's all time most memorable moments.   In an astounding bit of acting, Sjostrom, like a Swedish Scrooge, turns from an old, icy pedant, into a human being right before our eyes.  What a magnificent performance.The direction of Ingmar Bergman, the crystal clear black and white photography of Gunnar Fischer and the music by Erik Nordgren meld together into a seamless work of art that stays with you long after the final frame.If you have never seen WILD STRAWBERRIES, now is the perfect time as it has been released on a beautiful DVD by Criterion.

            "content": "'Wild Strawberries' was my second film from Swedish master director Ingmar Bergman, and it couldn't have come at a more appropriate time, just one month after the director's death, age 89. After 'The Seventh Seal' left me in absolute awe of its flawless beauty, 'Wild Strawberries,' released in the same year, did little to disappoint. Each and every frame is utterly perfect, and Bergman's hand so incredibly assured. Even in the most common situations \u0096 a close-up of Dr. Isak Borg's face, for example \u0096 the images on the screen seem to exude beauty; we see the character's aging, withered features and a sense of irreconcilable sadness lurking behind his eyes, and we, too, are crestfallen.'Wild Strawberries' stars Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, then 78, as Dr. Isak Borg, an aging professor who travels across the country from Stockholm to Lund to receive an honorary university degree. Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m himself was one of Sweden's greatest directors, no doubt a great influence upon Bergman, and he also directed 'K\u00f6rkarlen {The Phantom Chariot} (1921),' among my favourite films of the silent era. As he makes the day-long car journey, Isak begins to re-evaluate his entire life, prompted by memories, daydreams and unsettling nightmares. His wife has passed away some years ago, the end to a somewhat frictional marriage, and now Isak is fully aware that his own minutes are slowly ticking away. In the truly frightening opening dream sequence, he finds himself in a deserted city, with an ominous blackness looming ominously over his lonely form, and the complete and utter silence leaving him only too aware of the frantic beating of his failing heart. Approaching a coffin that has toppled from a carriage into the street, Isak finds within it his own expressionless corpse.Accompanying Isak on his journey to Lund is his daughter-in-law, Marianne (Ingrid Thulin), who is currently facing marital problems with her husband and possesses a certain bitterness towards his father. The marriage between Marianne and Evald (Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand) is very much like that between Isak and his long-deceased wife, and one of Isak's final wishes is that he can convince his son not to make the very same mistakes that he did. Also along for the trip is young hitchhiker Sara (Bibi Andersson), who reminds Isak of his lost childhood love, and her two friends Anders and Viktor, who both love her. A bickering married couple whom they pick up after a car accident (played by Gunnel Brostr\u00f6m and Gunnar Sj\u00f6berg) act as a cold reminder of Isak's many unhappy years with his wife, Karin (Gertrud Fridh).Considering the solemn subject matter, Bergman includes quite a few amusing moments in his film, many arising from Anders and Victor's childlike bickering over the existence of God. There is a genuine air of optimism infused throughout the story, and the ending \u0096 though I thought it came all too soon \u0096 is both gratifying and heartwarming. 'Wild Strawberries' is a beautiful tale of life, death and redemption, and nobody tells it more beautifully than Ingmar Bergman.",

Through flash backs and dream scenes there is much symbolism to punctuate the choices made. The emotional journey the man takes involves soul searching and may lead to potential healing of past relationships he has soured. The film has a rather expected story arc and for me lacks striking cinematography or shot framing.

The absence of hands on the clocks, and his own hand pulling him into the ghostly coffin indicate his anticipation that the end is near. The viewer is exceptionally powerfully drawn into the reality of what is taking place, as the aging man revisits the scenes of his past. Ingmar Bergman described himself as allowing his actors increasing freedom in self-direction, in terms of both action and dialogue. This attitude seems almost to have been initiated with this performance by Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m.

Bergman uses dreams and allegorical images and characters to illustrate his idea that the greatest waste of a life is to live it isolation.  Wild Strawberries is also light and humorous in places, with a gentle and loving depiction of the doctor's family in his youth (though I think it's important that we never see the doctor interacting with his past family until the very end).  He is ultimately redeemed, and Bergman is stating, I think, that there is hope for us to change even until the very end of our lives, and that such change is worth undertaking.  One of the great strengths of this movie, and of Bergman's work in general, is that he creates characters who function successfully as both \"types\" -- embodiments of ideas, philosophies, or points of view -- and also as credible individuals in a narrative about whom we care.  That's difficult to do.",

            "content": "'Wild Strawberries' is the account by a 78-year old man of a day spent on the road with his unhappy daughter-in-law and three young hitch-hikers, as he travels to receive an honorary doctorate for 50 years service as a doctor, scientist and inventor.  The film is full of bitterness and unhappiness - Marianne has left her emotionally congealed husband because he refuses to inflict a baby on the world (that old chestnut); they crash into and give a lift to a married couple who seem like refugees from a latter Bergman movie, lacerating in a sado-masochistic relationship.  Isak Borg has a series of dreams and memories pointing out the emotional failures of his life.  And yet the movie ends on a note of tranquillity and tentative reconciliation.  all the old doom and gloom stuff that riddled earlier Bergman movies - God, death etc. - is wonderfully parodied in the figures of two male hitch-hikers whose metaphysical boxing matches sublimate frustrated desire for the third.With hindsight, we can refract 'Strawberries' through the lens of its sister picture, Bergman's last masterpiece 'Fanny and Alexander'.  In 'Strawberries', and old man looks back at his life, filmed by a young man; in 'Fanny', Bergman himself is the old man looking back at his youth.  As with 'Fanny', not everything in this film is as it seems, and as with all Bergman films, what seems to be narratively transparent is actually a labyrinth strewn with mines for the unwary viewer.We should remember at all times that 'Strawberries' doesn't unfold on an objective 'realistic' level, but is a memoir shaped by an old man with certain vested interests.  Early on, his daughter-in-law accuses him of being an egoist behind his old-world charm, and we should remember this when faced with a resolution that seems to be brought about by his good offices. It is significant that Borg's reputation - for either goodness or failure - is not shown or proven to the audience, but discussed and analysed by other characters, both in the real life story and in the dreams and memories (i.e. he is analysing himself).  In the very process at which he is supposed to be enlightening himself about his life's failure, he remains absent from life, a detached observer, not reaping emotional reward or pain because he has put himself mentally above them (literally, as a man lying alone in bed). The movement of the film is actually quite negative.  The film is that rare thing, a European road movie.  Whereas the American variant is usually a journey into the unknown, the future, a journey of progress, Europe cannot offer that freedom, it is too small, too cluttered, too marked by history. So a European road movie, while seeming to go forward, is actually a journey backwards into the past.  The physical landscape through which Borg drives is also a mental landscape, as he passes crucial personal landmarks, the summer house in which he was 'betrayed' by his fiancee, his mother's house, the petrol station whose owners he once helped.  Bergman is used to playing with layers of narrative reality, muddying the boundaries of dreams, wishes, reality etc.  At the first stop, the summer house, Borg transforms, through memory, a physical landscape into the world of the past, as he watches his fiancee seduced by his brother, the key moment in his life that seemed to deaden him emotionally.  This isn't even memory - he wasn't there - it is a projection, an imposing of his fantasy, his will on a truth he will never access.  He is brought back to 'reality' by a young  woman.  Except this woman is played by  the same actress as the one who played his fiancee, and they share the same name.  this may be coincidence, or it may be part of the defence mechanism of a man who killed human contact with logic, the very logic with which he is writing this memoir we're watching, providing the redemption in which we're expected to believe (later, the petrol shop owners, in a real-world scene, are far too young to remember kindness from decades previously, suggesting narrative boundaries well and truly erased).  This is before any of the 'official' dream sequences.  There is a logic, a progression.  The film begins with a dream, where an old man sees his own death, having ordered his life in such a way that he remains alone, like his dad (Oedipal resonances not just in his dad's handless watch, but the blind eyes as a sign under it),  and ends with a dream, with an old man returning to his birth, the sight of his father and mother, his younger self non-existent.  The point before betrayal, before the messiness of life.  Borg finds tranquillity in a dream of non-being.  if this is happiness, reconciliation, peace, than God help us.",

            "content": "Old professors on road trips, no matter how many fully dressed blonds you add, will probably never provide much wildness or strawberries, especially if they spend more time with them dreaming as they snooze during the trip then take in the landscape and people. Ingmar definitely failed despite apparently the entire country of Sweden voting to the contrary for their film hero. He hints that he may be attempting irony, but that really doesn't work outside of a few instances where the actors pull it off.One way the irony could have worked is if the film is understood more like Robot and Frank involving an old man nearing death with a failing brain. It might be seen as an allegory in why making plans based on a dream you have the night before is unlikely to add wildness or strawberries to your day.The film seems more like that of a young, naive director playing with university ideas and quite possibly trying to antagonize a professor he hated, or simply fool him into grading the film highly by not committing to anything and leaving it open for interpretation.At best, it's an interesting look into the Summer conventions and traditions of Sweden in the 1950s where pipe smoking is viewed as healthy and marrying cousins is normal. All this can be better achieved through some clips of the film, an actual documentary, and some photo essays. You'll also have the benefit of knowing it rather than wondering if you're lost in somebody's bad dreams.",

            "review_title": "Psychological masterwork",
            "content": "Our world filled with adverts and illusions hardly occurs to remark the old age of man. Deep within a reality where beauty and carnal desires take over, seldom is there room for elderly people. Would an old person make for a good leading character in the jungle of muscled idols? In fact, more than 50 years ago the master director of Swedish origin, Ingmar Bergman, proved that to be possible. An old man, Isak Borg (Victor Sjostrom) with his rich experience and subtle psyche is able to win viewers' hearts, is capable of inviting us to join him in the journey through his life, to shed a tear sometimes, to laugh a bit when needed in order to learn modesty and ask for forgiveness... That is the uniqueness of the greatly psychological picture I have seen and would never forget - WILD STRAWBERRIES.Let me first look deeper at the idea of the content as it appears, rightly so, that there are no useless aspects in this masterful film. The old professor Isak Borg is presented to us before the credits as a very intellectual pedant. He has a family but...they go on existing in the photos that we see on his desk rather than in mutual understanding and good co-existence. Soon, the elderly professor invites us deeper into his inner worlds: he has a dream filled with thrill, symbols, angst odd mystery and... as he wakes up, we encounter his outside world, people around him... What begins is a long journey he sets for with his daughter-in-law Marianne (Ingrid Thulin) from the capital city to the cathedral of Lund where he is to receive the honorary doctorate. What a privilege! Yet, he does not see it this way. It does not occur to satisfy him much. There is something else he longs for in the depth of his mind. All the tension is about to fill our imagination when they stop at the old mansion, the very spot where Isak played as a child, spent lovely days of youth, the youth full of dreams, achievements and losses...He starts to live his life again within his memory, all images and stream of events are so clear, all the people so close, including the beautiful love of his life, Sara (Bibi Andersson) and the whole family with cute twins who cannot learn to speak only when spoken to and deaf uncle Aron who indeed loves the song. The past blends with the presence, dreams with reality, memories with fantasies...The psychology is expressed throughout the film from the Freudian aspect of angst, dreams, desires to the very development of reconciliation and forgiveness. The images combined with sounds and symbols (consider for instance the dream sequence) leave a powerful impact in each viewer. The strange combination between events and people resembles a truly genuine insight into the psyche of the character, into his interior worlds and the exterior world. Here, I should add that everything seems to be, on the one hand, individual, on the other hand, deeply rooted within the fascinating country - Sweden, its landscape, its atmosphere and its society. Doesn't this journey through Sweden symbolize it in a way? But now let me focus on one man who makes the film a true rarity.The great psychology manifested in the film is possible to achieve thanks to the leading performance of Victor Sjostrom (the great Swedish actor and silent director - just to mention his PHANTOM CARRIAGE which had overwhelmed Bergman himself). Sjostrom does a marvelous job, he occurs to be unique and powerful and, at the same time, the most convincing and transcendent. He seems to represent his character's feelings in the most astonishing and authentic manner. Seldom do we find such a flawless performance. Here, what is left to me is just quote the director of the film, Ingmar Bergman, who said: \"Sjostrom's face shone, it emanated light - a reflection of a different reality, hitherto absent. His whole appearance was soft and gentle, his glance joyful and tender. It was like a miracle.\"The supporting cast also constitute a very authentic development of different psyches within the professor's exterior world. Just to mention Bibi Andersson who plays Sara, the woman who meant most in Isak's life, yet the woman whom he lost. Gunnar Bjornstrand does a fine job as Isak's desperate son, Evald. His despair combined with sophisticated psyche emanates from the screen. It is the woman, Marianne (Ingrid Thulin), who finds striking similarity between him and his father. Except for others, a mention must be made of Naima Wifstrand who portrays Isak's cold mother. Ms Wifstrand, who was once a queen of the operettas in Stockholm, highlights the most memorable aspects of a reclusive bitterness and coldness of her character. Besides, I think that Professor's housewife is another character that needs special attention. She symbolizes the opposite aspect of a psyche, someone in contrast with the Professor: not a great intellect but rather simplicity. She is so angry with him due to some minor obstacles, but, finally, respects him in the solemnity at Lund...All in all, WILD STRAWBERRIES is a timeless masterwork of psychology, a film that will capture you, absorb you to the very core no matter if you are young or elderly. It is also a wonderful lesson of life, of old age that has its angst, its regret, its bitterness, perhaps, but also the dignity of inner beauty that does not require much from the exterior world: just a heartfelt smile, a nice word or a beautiful song of love sung in your youthful enthusiasm. 10/10",

A metaphor for life and what you make of it. As someone who could understand how Isak could get that way, and even endorse how he feels, this was an eye- opening, and potentially life-changing, movie.While many of Bergman's movies are sombre and depressing, this, having started that way, turns it all around, channeling the negativity to find something positive.

            "content": "\"Wild Strawberries\", or Smultronst\u00e4llet (the original title), was one of two absolute gems Ingmar Bergman wrote in 1957, the other being The Seventh Seal. In both films, we witness the journey of a disillusioned man in pursuit of life satisfaction, an explanation to their existence. We are then introduced to a series of flashbacks, which will reveal a great deal about how they have been shaped into who they have become.The story is of aging professor Dr. Isak Borg and his feelings of remorse near the end of his life compelling him to seek out answers or at least some type of meaning. \"I hate resentful people\" he ironically mutters, though we are given the brief impression that it is all people he despises. As he travels to Lund with his disarmingly candid daughter-in-law, Marianne, to accept an honorary degree, he will encounter both people and places that will elicit memories, both the good and the bad, of his past, as we watch his feelings of melancholy gradually morph into the affirmation of life of which he was always searching for.So much of \"Wild Strawberries\" is, at its core, extraordinarily nuanced, with each new experience revealing another layer of our grouchy protagonist. \"The place where wild strawberries grow\", he gaily reminisces about at the film's beginning. I like to believe that, like 'Rosebud' in Citizen Kane, the wild strawberries serve as an emblem of the innocence in our youth, a memory that evokes hope and sheer joy, parts of life that many people will, as they grow older, seek to regain in some form or another.This film had me in a complete lost for words. It is able to connect with you on such an emotional, profoundly deep level beyond explanation. The cinematography is done with such care, with each detail almost emerging with a consciousness of its own. There is so much life in every frame, whether it being in the forest, the wild strawberry field. The acting and direction is subtle and true-to-life, as we feel that we are witnessing the telling of a genuine life story rather than observing a film. It is, in simplest terms, pure cinematic art.",

Other, more eloquent reviewers have already said it better than me. I'd just like to say that it's a shame many dismiss Bergman's work as the epitome of pretentious, incomprehensible, depressing foreign cinema for art-house snobs, when it really is anything but. Unlike the stereotypical Bergman film, Smultronst\u00e4llet is all at once terrifyingly honest and beautifully uplifting. The performances by Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, Ingrid Thulin and Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand are beyond description, and the script by Bergman himself has to rank among the best ever written. Not to mention the direction, which is by turns spine-tingling and heartbreaking, and the unforgettable cinematography by Gunnar Fischer. Smultronst\u00e4llet manages to combine flawless and impressive technical aspects with an understandable story that is timeless and easy to relate to. No other film does this as well as this one, which is why I don't hesitate to call it the greatest film ever made.",

One very cold and realistic story about the differences in human emotions and aging is full of strange harmony. An aged professor of medicine examines his life while traveling to university where he taught for years in order to receive an honorable mention. His estranged daughter in law travels with him and the two of them visited many important places from his past.The Professor meets, on this journey,interesting people and they become part of his fantasy...The atmosphere is grim and scenery is presented in the form of a beautiful wasteland. They are a kind of symbol of solitude, loneliness and leached life. However, the three youngest protagonists try to disturb this harmony. Young people are full of life, even if that life does not make sense.Mr. Bergman has symbolically linked every appearance, details, events, things and objects together. He connects them in a life story. A certain conflict in the character is visible in this film. Youth, playfulness and innocence against old age, remorse and guilt. Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m as Professor Isak Borg is a cold and egoistic old man. Wild strawberries are a symbol of love in his youth. However, wild strawberries have chosen someone else. His story is real, touching and painful. He is a character who is admired, but never loved.Ingrid Thulin as Marianne Borg is a woman who tries to understand the cold emotion. However, she yields under her own emotions. Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand as Evald Borg is an unwanted son and a ruthless husband. He rejected his life for no reason. However, he understands the difference between love and loneliness. Bibi Andersson as Sara is a playful girl who has two wooers. She will awaken deeply buried memories in an old man.The story, perhaps, is not sufficiently simple and clear. Life is not simple. Redemption is not the point of this story. Life is strange and tortuous path between emptiness and self-realization. Some people manage to fill their emptiness with emotions. Some people fail. Understanding and reconciliation between the different characters are the point in this movie.Mr. Bergman is a genius.",

Not every film from any director is good; they all have ones they would like to forget. This film is actually quite simple; if you are arrogant and self-righteous, you have a good chance of being lonely when you enter old age. This is really a cautionary tale; a bit like A Christmas Carol, but without the Future. I can identify with the professor, because I am one as well. I have been arrogant and self-righteous in the past as well. And I have suffered the consequences of my poor behavior as a result. Luckily, I am a half dozen years younger than the professor in the film, which gives me a little time to recover, but not a lot. Bibi Anderson is excellent as well as Skostrom in the lead role. Bergman films always have an excellent supporting cast; especially the housekeeper. Honors like an honorary doctoral degree mean very little in comparison to fostering your personal relationships with other people; particularly family. That is the cautionary aspect of this film.",

            "content": "This is a quiet film, with an old man reflecting back on his life as he travels to an awards ceremony with his daughter-in-law. It may sound too sedate to hold one's interest, but it does. Through dream sequences filled with symbolism and dialog with people he meets along the way, we get a picture painted of his life, its key moments, and how he evolved over time. We see the common thread \u2013 his serious, intelligent, considerate, yet cool and judgmental personality \u2013 and how that made him a very successful doctor, but created difficulties in his personal life. We see how he lost the real love of his life when she was picking wild strawberries and his own more passionate brother pursued her, and how his subsequent marriage to another was plagued with strife and his wife's infidelity. We see how this carried down to his son, his unhappy childhood, his depression, and the difficulty he has in his own marriage. We also see the perils of old age, seeing death coming, being sentimental, and fearing becoming obsolete. We see that despite his brilliant career and the very prestigious award he's just been given, the most meaningful, happy moment in his life was simply fishing on a peaceful day with his father, a sentiment which has a 'Rosebud' feel to it.The film is not heavy or hard to watch and just enjoy Bergman's storytelling, but at the same time it does have a weightiness to it - in recalling the soul-crushing moments of sadness in life, in his sentimental reflections of his childhood, in his weighing in on two younger men's debate about God's existence (\"I see His traces wherever flowers bloom\"), and as he thinks about his mortality. Some comic relief is provided in his relationship with housekeeper, who brings a smile when she leaves her door ajar as she goes to bed in case he \"wants anything\", after having bickered with him for the entire movie (and presumably decades of their lives).I don't see the film as being optimistic or pessimistic, or as much 'warmer' than his other work, though other viewers certainly seem to and there are moments of charm, such as when the young woman of the three he gives a ride to talks to him, asks him for advice, and sweetly says she loves him as they part. Bibi Andersson played both this role and the role of the girl in the strawberry patch that he lost, which has a certain symmetry and renewal to it. However, I think the movie is realistic and balanced, with just as much bittersweetness as sweetness \u2013 even the married couple they nearly get into a car accident with make endless snide comments about one another \u2013 and its genius is in showing us truths about life that are common to us all.While the movie doesn't preach or overtly push a message, you realize just how hard it is to lead a virtuous, positive life without regrets - and reflect on your own life, where you place priorities, how you treat people, whether you appreciate the small moments, or recognize the pivotal ones \u2013 all the things that you will probably remember at the end. Great art does this, spur reflection, and that's the case with 'Wild Strawberries'. Don't believe all the hype, but at the same time, don't be intimidated either \u2013 this would be a good one to see.",

            "content": "What a poetic coincidence! The night after I finished my second experience of Ingmar Bergman's \"Wild Strawberries\", I couldn't sleep, invaded by countless thoughts about the purpose of my life, questioning every single choice I had to make since I was given that privilege, and ultimately wondering which path my sentimental life would have taken, had my heart not picked the chosen one. \"Wild Strawberries\" chronicles a series of occurrences such as melancholic reveries, nightmares, nostalgic reminiscences or real-life encounters during the unforgettable journey of Dr. Isaak Borg, an affable and educated 78-year old physician, who must travel from Stockholm to Lund to receive a Doctoris Jubilaris celebrating the 50th year after his doctorate. From our perspective, there's no doubt that Isaak was and is still an honorable man. Early in the film, he stops at a gas station and a young Max Von Sydow recalls the days when Isaak was a general practitioner, speaking very highly of good old Doctor Isaak Borg.If not a flawless man, Isaak immediately inspires our respect and admiration, and this is a credit to the Swedish veteran actor Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m who exudes a powerful mixture of charismatic wisdom and sympathetic shyness. These traits are often branded as coldness by his entourage, but we personally suspect that only a defensive mind, such as his pregnant daughter-in-law Marianne, played by a breathtakingly beautiful Ingrid Thullin, would be so critical of Isaak's manners. However, as the story progresses, and as we get deeper in the relationships between Isaak and his mother, and with his son Ewald, played by the inevitable Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand, we realize that maybe, Isaak inherited from his mother (and Ewald from Isaak) this strange capability to inspire defensive mechanisms from the others. And maybe the key of some mistakes that might have undermined his life can only be drained from the well of memories.\"Wild Strawberries\" features an enigma of a man told from the others' perspectives. Given its surrealistic undertones, the film is ahead of its time, but not quite. I found personally ironic that Bergman loathed so much \"Citizen Kane\" when he unconsciously borrowed some elements from Orson Welles, except that the mystery doesn't focus on a man who's dead, but on a man who contemplates death at the twilight of his life, and wonders which other paths could have brought more happiness in his life. And as a genuine genius, Bergman understood the value of the road-movie format for character studies, that would inspire such memorable movies as \"Five Easy Pieces\", \"Easy Rider\", Woody Allen's \"Deconstructing Harry\" or Alexander Payne's \"About Schmidt\".The road format is indeed crucial, as if the way that leads to our soul's abysses were like some tortuous roads with as many encounters as there are facets in our personalities. During Isaak's journey, the most significant moment occurs when he picks up three young hitchhikers among them a lively blonde girl, Sara, played by a young Bibi Anderson. And Papa Isaak (the tender nickname she gives him) grows reciprocally fond of her, thinking back of Sara, her youth's sweetheart, as if she was resurrecting the old sparkle that defined his younger years, or reopened the concealed wound of having let Sara slip from his hands, to one of his cousins.Each scene of \"Wild Strawberries\" carries a symbolic resonance, an embittered couple reminds of his failed marriage and a sordid episode where he symbolically lost his wife and didn't try to conquer her back, out of guilt or an apathetic weakness, surrendering to the humiliating weight of fatality. The most significant episode of the film is still the titular one, where plunged in a deep meditation, Isaak finds himself in his family cottage at the seaside, with Sara, the girl he used to court in the wild strawberries patch. Ingmar, like Proust for literature, invented a symbol to define the most cherished places of our childhood. Sadly enough, Isaak's cookie-Proust left a bitter taste. And while the pieces of the puzzle are assembled during this unforgettable road trip, Borg's odyssey highlights many aspects of his life and memories, inviting us in retrospect to question the value of our own lives. As usual, in Bergman's films, there are two levels of appreciations, as we follow the story of protagonists, we're tunneled into our own soul and are invited to meditate on the meaning of our lives, even more because we (contrarily to Isaak) can afford hope. And so does Marianne who embodies our perspective and refuses to see her husband inheriting the same traits Isaak took from her mother. Marianne's future is the fresh air that extinguishes some of Isaak's demons. For it is wise to learn from our mistakes, but even wiser and nobler to help other people to learn from ours. And this might be what the 'wild strawberries' stands for, a cinematic metaphor for this state of felicity following a great achievement. As a poet said: it's when you have reached the mountain top, that you shall begin to climb. No doubt that Isaak was finally climbing his way to some peace of mind at the end of the journey.\"Wild Strawberries\" is a humanistic masterpiece inviting us to discover ourselves, to find eternal peace and happiness through our memories. This is not 'inner child' material but a survival move guided by the nihilism induced by life as a linear movement toward death, ruled by mistakes, but paved by achievements, the very tools we use to build a personal history and connect it with our family's, thus contributing to the never-ending transmission of life.If Isaak's experience can contribute to the happiness of his son, his daughter-in-law or a young stranger, his life had a purpose after all... in this vaster scheme driven by the superior forces Ingmar Bergman tried to touch through his Art, like he did, the same year with another masterpiece: \"The Seventh Seal\".",

The themes are universal, death, family, the generations, even technology. I think it helps a viewer to realize the care with which a Bergman, or a Kubrick, or any film maker of the first rank approaches the script, shoot, edit, release sequence. Because Bergman had his hands in all of that he had a chance to look at every scene from all angles. Any seeming clunkiness or absract reality presented has a reason for being there. I found it best to sit without concerning myself with why anything happened and let the movie roll forward trusting the people to be who they were and go where they would.

The action converts past and present, reality and fantasy, the present harshly and starkly lit, the earlier memories more relaxed and lyrical as if, for an old man, the past - that other country - was better than the time and place he inhabits now. Each new character, each reminiscence as it springs up in the mind of professor reveals something new about him - his failings, his shortcomings, the reasons why, in his apparently successful and honored old age, he is alone and lonely. This is, admittedly, an uneven film, verbally over explicit, but it is packed with vivid imagery - an early dream sequence, both mysterious and yet significant; a disenchanted couple squabbling fiercely in a car; the sad beauty of Marianne, unhappy daughter-in-law; the words, memories and gestures of professor's mother; the distancing effect produced by the device of having the professor visiting his own past unseen by those who shared it with him; the meeting with Akerman. It is a sombre, striking work, uncompromising in its examination of the protagonist and Victor Sjostrom, in his last screen role, is splendid.

It is very useful at that age to discover that other generations had intelligent ideas about how to construct film, and that you and and your neat friends don't have a patent on originality.This is one of those works you respect for it's filmic contributions but that a viewer doesn't really enjoy per se. There are enjoyable bits in it, but it suffers, like many Bergman movies, of a stagnating sameness from moment to moment. No Bergman film I've ever seen \"builds\" over it's running time; which would seem to be the benefit of placing one moment next to another in a narrative format. Consequently I have no idea how Bergman decided this was \"done.\" It meanders. The rampant symbols (& dream imagery) offer no middle ground being either a) positively obvious and Fruedian or b) so murky that I just don't care what they might mean if I unraveled them.I used to be able to make it through Bergman movies. (Well, actually I never made it through the Seventh Seal) But now, there's not a chance. If he shows people sleeping (Wild Strawberries) or lazing about (Persona) it's a doubly fatal to me; like Snow White's poisoned apple. I fell asleep in the theater during one of the later dream sequences.I'm a cerebral guy, but Bergman is just too lost in his head as a film-maker for me. I couldn't find my interest in Wild Strawberries with a team of Swedish film analysts helping me. As distant as the silent era felt in the 70's the mid-century classics now begin to recede identically for me. And these films feel very dated & ungenerous, despite their merits in context. Lars von Trier once said \"The best thing that could happen to Swedish film is for Ingmar Bergman to die.\" Bergman died last week. Long live the new Swedish cinema.",

The grotesque dream where a hearse containing his double symbolically disintegrates and so on, has been mentioned. The doctor dreams on during the journey: he is  scientifically detached when his (now long dead) wife is assaulted by a stranger;there are surrealistic vignettes of a garden where wild strawberries are spilled,or a dinner where they are eaten,all fifty or more years earlier.The contrast between golden youth...more Swedish blonde goddesses...is marked when his aged features gaze on childhood scenes. Perhaps the examination scene in a medical students' class sums it up: he is ineffective,is weighed and found wanting. His son,stiff,upright,resembling Scandinavian royalty is also estranged from his wife because of her revelation of an early pregnancy. In a final rejection he cannot even presume first names with his housekeeper who insists on standing,very uprightly for her years,on her professional dignity. In order to perceive the nuances,this  existential film of Bergman's about what might be miscalled the \"Categorial imperatives\" requires certainly more than one viewing. Look for Max von Sydow as a Texaco gas station attendant. They are all four-dimensional characters.",

            "content": "Although I have only seen it once, I can safely say that I was taken aback by this film. Ingmar Bergman is a master of self-exploration and takes a beautiful, sometimes haunting, look at the emptiness in an elderly man's life. Professor Isak Borg is on his way to Lund to receive and honorary award from the college at which he used to teach. Now seventy-eight years old, Borg is cantankerous, cold and arrogant to the people around him. The film begins with some narration, Borg is setting the story up for us, filling us in quickly before we begin to follow him. He has a dream at the beginning of the film that sets the tone for the rest of the film. He is on a street that is devoid of any signs of life. The clocks have no hands and he is all alone. He knows what this all means; death is near. A solitary man is seen standing on the sidewalk and Borg goes to speak to him. When he turns, we discover a shriveled and disgusting face staring back at him. A cart comes carrying a casket and catches itself on a lamp post, losing it's wheel and dropping the casket into the street. Borg goes to examine the body and finds that it his own. When he tries to move away, his dead self grabs him, refusing to let go.After waking from the nightmare, he informs his maid that he is going to Lund to receive his award without her, and instead takes with him his daughter-in-law, Marianne. Along the way, Marianne tells Borg why she (and her husband) dislike him. This forces Borg to think about the things he has done in life and his dreams take him back to specific events in his life, events he did not get to see, in which the people he cared for were explaining their feelings about him to another person. Borg was, in his early years, in love with his Cousin Sarah, but eventually lost her to his brother, Sigfrid. Now, in the present, Sarah has come back into Isak's life (despite the fact that she had died years ago) in the way of Sara, a hitchhiker with two companions (obvious representations of young Isak and Sigfrid) all of whom ride to Lund with Isak and Marianne. After a long journey filled with bizarre dreams, discussions on the existence of God, discussions of love and it's importance and a near deadly car accident, Professor Borg finally arrives in Lund, receives his award and goes to stay at his son's house. While there, he realizes the errors and mistakes he made in life and vows to reform himself, though he knows death is right around the corner. Sara and her companions are leaving for Italy, but congratulate him before departing. Sara takes this time to tell Isak that she loved him all along, a fact which seems to make a huge mark on the old man. He later helps to reunite his son and Marianne, whose marriage is failing as his once was, so that they do not have to suffer as her has. We leave Borg after his final dream, a dream in which he is reunited with his mother and father who are sitting on a river bed, just outside their summer home. We see a sparkle of life in Borgs eyes that was previously thought to be non-existent. Death is near, but he is able to accept it know, knowing that he has come to terms with his life.",

            "content": "To compare \"Wild Strawberries\" to a story that's a bit more grounded (yet still part fantasy), what instantly comes to mind is \"A Christmas Carol.\" Though that classic is much more exaggerated, it shares that reflective spirit, sense of personal regret and un-fulfillment and the desire to make amends. The difference is that in \"Wild Strawberries\" we need no ghosts - - only Ingmar Bergman as our guide.Isak is a very old professor on his way to Lund, Sweden with his daughter-in-law to receive an honorary award, when in his aging state he's confronted by dreams of his childhood and consequent past regrets. On the trip, he also meets some vivacious young people and a bickering couple who continue to steer him toward a path of using his last days/months/years to bring meaning into his life.Released at the same time as Bergman classic \"The Seventh Seal,\" \"Strawberries\" is also incredibly contemplative and full of incredibly philosophical dialogue. Both films confront themes of mortality, but \"Strawberries\" is the more hopeful of the two. Although we pity Isak and the film's other characters who seem to have failed miserably to suck any joy or positive meaning from life, there's nothing imminently bad or unavoidable -- there is great capacity for betterment.Bergman's excellence as a director resonates throughout the film through its opening scene with ticking clocks and first major dream sequence on the barren streets to the final zoom-ins and close-ups. His every shot is a portrait of an emotion or at the least of a man caught somewhere between the past and death. Like all great classic/black and white directors, Bergman understands the powerful moments of his story and reserves his best just for them.Although Bergman creates more pity than empathy (though it could be my fault I've always struggled to really find personal epiphany in viewing his stories) and his language more intentionally mystical at times than intrinsically inspired, he manages to capture the uncertainty he's trying to address better than anyone else; His portrait of emotion brings us closer to life's toughest questions than any other director has ever dared.It's the hopeful ending, however, that really makes \"Wild Strawberries\" a great film. Despite Bergman showing us a mirror that's very tough to look at for an extended period of time, he never suggests that we can't look into it and change whatever it is we don't like. It's that outlet that makes the thematic difficulty of the film all that much easier to bear.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",

            "content": "There are certain themes that connect Ingmar Bergman's films together, despite them being so dissimilar with one another in terms of story and subject matters. He goes from a medieval knight to a psychological thriller about two women in a beach cabin. From a period costume drama to a road trip movie about a professor yearning for the days of his youth. That last one being Wild Strawberries in a nutshell.Yet all these films have a distinguishing cinematography and style uniquely Bergman. They're also thematically similar. You can see thoughts about death, mortality, the meaning of life and the existence of self in all of them. This film focuses most heavily on the meaning of life. How much are we shaped by our youth, how much weight the individual aspects of our life have, what is the proper balance between the sentimentality of relationships and the responsibilities of career. And so on, and so on. It's probably the most thoughtful film I've yet seen from Bergman. Also the most prone to symbolism and art tropes. Usually I'm against those, unless done really well, but with Bergman they are, more often than not, and he's also really blatant and honest with them. He wants you to notice all the little tricks and touches, instead of hiding them in the background for only true cinephiles to find and appreciate.Wild Strawberries is worth a watch if you've liked other Bergman film - especially The Seventh Seal - and/or if you like a film with a lot of panache when it comes to the art of making films. It bears some resembles to the Christmas Carol on a story-level, without being a Christmas movie at all, so if you're interested in that, you might want to check it out as well.",

            "content": "Last night, at our monthly film series \"Great Films @ the Cathedal,\" we showed Ingmar Bergman's \"Wild Strawberries.\" This film is one of his early films that propelled Bergman's recognition by his peers as one of the greatest and influential film directors of all time. It's a psychological drama about a Swedish physician (Dr. Isak Borg), later a professor, coming to terms with his life in his elder years: his mistakes, weaknesses, his successes, his strengths.Knowing Bergman's life in the family in which he grew up helps one better understand both this film as well as his others. Bergman's mother was a fairly strong-willed nurse while his father was also strong-willed and a very strict Lutheran pastor who later was appointed pastor to the King of Sweden. Bergman's father was punitive with his son, e.g., putting him in a dark closet for hours as a young child as a reaction to any wrong he considered his son had done. Young Ingmar was entranced by the stained glass in his father's churches -- their saints, angels, devils, scenes from Biblical stories. Ingmar's father and mother did NOT have a comfortable, happy marriage. One sees echoes of these experiences in the issues, the traits and behaviors of the characters Bergman gives us as both a scriptwriter and film director.Bergman described how the germ of this \"WS\"'s narrative came to him while he was driving across Sweden and passing through the town in which he grew up. He imagined going to homes in which he'd once lived--opening the door and observing life and his relatives as they had been and then, after a bit--exiting through the door back to life in the present. So this device (plus some troubling dreams) is used to help jolt his main character, Dr. Borg, into reassessing his attitudes and behavior.My explorations of my own family plus my work as a family therapist helped me appreciate this movie very much. One sees ample instances of how some of these traits are transmitted and cascade through the generations. The tone at the end of the film is largely satisfying to most. Our group unanimously thought \"WS\" ranked among the very best of the best films we've seen this season.Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, a renowned Swedish film director and former actor who played Dr. Borg, was in somewhat precarious health throughout the filming and died not long after completing this film.FWIW, the title \"Wild Strawberries\" refers to a scene in the movie in which a young woman goes to a patch of little known wild strawberries to pick some as a succulent gift for a relative.",

            "content": "Wild Strawberries was one of the first Ingmar Bergman movies that I ever saw. I watched it for the first time about fifteen years ago, and I haven't seen it since. It's been a movie that I've always spoken very highly of, but also one that I've grown to remember less and less over the years.Well, when my mother bought me the 39-movie collection of Ingmar Bergman films from the Criterion Collection, I decided that there was no way that I wasn't going to go through every film, whether I've seen it or not, in the order that the collection recommends. It's not a chronological order, but one designed to demonstrate the three major stages of Bergman's career. Wild Strawberries is movie number four in the curated order.Anyway, the story of Isak Borg taking the long way south to a ceremony in his honor is amazingly affecting. I see a lot of parallels to Kurosawa's Ikiru in terms of theme and, to a lesser extent, tone. Considering that they were released only 5 years apart, it's not hard to imagine that Kurosawa's film influenced Bergman's, if only indirectly. Reading what I have about the conception of Wild Strawberries, I've seen nothing to indicate as much.However, there's still a story of an old man, filled with regret, looking back over his life. In both films, the central characters decide to do something with their remaining years. It's much more pronounced in Ikiru with the building of the playground, but Borg, as he looks back over his life and his failures as husband and father, also looks to the future, in particular, around his son and daughter-in-law. His regrets around the past he tries to mend by perhaps trying to mend the relationship troubles that his son and daughter-in-law are going through, a relationship that, he says, reminds him of his own loveless relationship with his deceased wife.The film overall really is a balance between travelling backwards and forwards at the same time. There's a literal travel forward as Borg drives south towards what little there is of his own future, as well as the future of his line manifested in his son, but there's also the travel backwards, where he stops the care to visit the house where his family spent their summers in his childhood. He sees scenes that he never actually witnessed (where he's described as being on the other side of the lake), and what he sees are bright and pristinely white portraits of life at the time. This flashback contains a bright almost theatricality that creates an unreality around the action, which is appropriate since Borg is inventing the whole thing (or living out an invention he's previously created). He also visits his mother where he finds an old picture of him and the brother who stole his childhood love away from him, a relationship that produced several children in juxtaposition to Borg's single (potentially unwanted, and most likely illegitimate) child.It is this dual journey, including the dueling back and forth between two young suitors both fighting for Bibi Anderson (one a minister in training and the other a doctor in training) about the nature and existence of God, which Borg just watches with detached bemusement. The only thing that ends up allowing the two young men to set aside their differences is when the three youths decide to honor Borg and his lifetime of work. And here, I think, is the key to the message of the film. Borg is unsatisfied with his life because he never loved his wife and was cruelly disciplinarian to his son. He was dedicated to his work (despite having obvious concerns about his ability in that regard through a late dream sequence) instead of his family, and when he falls to sleep in his son's guest bedroom, he has just seen his son and daughter-in-law reconciled and dreamed of seeing his own mother and father at that isolated house in the Swedish countryside. What made Borg happy wasn't his accomplishments, but his long ignored attachments to actual people.It's a wonderfully humanist tale from a director who is more well-known for existential dread and stark images rather than a gentle touch.Wild Strawberries, much like Ikiru, is one of my favorites precisely for those attributes, how well they are executed, and how much they contrast with the rest of the respective directors' work.",

            "content": "Smultronstallet or Wild Strawberries, by Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, is one of the greatest films ever.  Its cinematography, screenplay, acting, and directing are superb.  This motion picture is amazing in its emotional impact and in my opinion is better than Bergman's other masterwork, The Seventh Seal.  I say this because although Seventh Seal's plot is more ominous and the ending is a little more well done, Wild Strawberries could actually make you change your outlook on life.  Great films do this.  Just look at \"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest\", \"The Deer Hunter\", \"Platoon\", \"Natural Born Killers\", and \"JFK\", among others.  Overall, a fantastic film that deserves many viewings and more attention than bloated American Hollywood blockbusters.4/4 stars",

This is firstly explored on a personal level, our protagonist's road trip also functioning as a catalyst for journeys back in time: the juxtaposition of moving forward, propelled by an external force, yet looking backwards at every point.Such is our experience of time that in moving forward we always glance backwards - I am reminded of Vonnegut's superb comment on the story of Lot's wife in his novel Slaughterhouse Five, that to look back is to be human, especially when we are forbidden. The wonderful observation from all of this in Wild Strawberries is that the past and the present do exist together, that the former forges the latter and that though time affects us in a linear fashion we experience it in a different way, a more flexible way.This meditation is only further deepened by the inclusion of the younger generation. These young characters play at adulthood and echo what came before - the older generation see themselves in them. Interestingly, where our protagonist finds nothing but sorrow and regret in the past, they fetishise it in a naive way - using him as their symbol, an anchoring point to an illusory past. They glorify the oldness of the old man, seeing him as an antique and simplifying him with their perspective.What we learn is that all of this is false, the past is not a thing to be but on a pedestal or feared, the past exists in the present.",

Quite moving in spots, but somehow never ended up with as much power as I expected. Two critics' notes made sense to me. One said that, for as great and transparent as Sjostrom's performance is, he is so sweet and likable a presence it's hard to reconcile him with a man his daughter in law openly admits she doesn't like because of his cold nature. The other point \u2013 which could also be applied to 'The Seventh Seal' is that the film seems less special today because the stylistic barriers it broke and the doors it opened (an almost totally subjective film, dream sequences of depth and meaning, etc) have since become a familiar part of film grammar.

At first sight Isak Borg seems a friendly old man, but already at the beginning of the film he proves that he is not by the way he treats his housekeeper.The rest of the movie is not only a roadmovie (from Stockholm to Lund) but through the places he visits and the memory's these places evoke we also learn a lot about the (selfish) life of professor Borg (as he does himself!). Bergman uses three storytelling techniques to underline the egocentric personality of Borg.The first is the conversations he has with his daughter in law Marianne (Ingrid Thulin).The second is the interaction with the three hitchikers (2 boys and 1 girl) they pick up. The girl has to choose which of the boys she likes more, the one who is very intellectual or the one who is very sensitive. The girl looks very much like professor Borgs first love (which we met in dream sequence number 2). Not coincidentally these two girls are played by the same actress (Bibi Andersson).The third are the three dream sequences. I already mentioned the second dream sequence in which professor Borg meets his first love. The first dream sequence is maybe the most famous. In this sequence professor Borg wanders in a city in which the clocks have no clock hands, hinting at mortality. This first dream sequence made me think of the famous scenes designed by Salvador Dali in Hitchcocks \"Spellbound\" (1945). The third dream sequence maybe not the best known but is in my opinion the most relevant with respect to the theme of the film. In this scene professor Borg has to pass an exam. Much to his surprise the examiner does not ask technical questions but personal questions, to which professor Borg does not know the answers. The exam closes with the following dialogue:Professor Isak Borg: (In Professor Borg's dream) And the punishment?\nThe Examiner: I don't know. The usual, I suppose.\nProfessor Isak Borg: The usual?\nThe Examiner: Loneliness.At the end of the film there is some sort of redemption.

Indeed, can there be an objective reality? this film, which its beautiful aesthetic stylisation (note especially the use of shadow in the dream sequence; the shape of the trees in the woods)seems to suggest that there is no objective reality, no symptamology which we can read and will allow us to reach a true conclusion. Rather than interpreting the moment when he sees his parents as him opting for non-existence over life, though, can we not read it as the moment when Isak realises that there is a chance for a connection, that happiness and intimacy are possible, that he waves to his parents across the gaps of time, memory and space and it is in his realisation that they had a moment of happiness that he is finally reconciled to his own existence? And, of course, this seems to suggest rather then that the new baby's happiness is dependent on the reconciliation of his son and daughter-in-law, which he attempts to effect. I especially enjoyed the early dream sequence with its haunting imagery and then the rather more loopy examination scene, which feel would definately support a second viewing...

            "content": "Watching Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries for the first time was an interesting experience because of three reasons. One, the film itself is terrific. Two, I watched it the same night as the 2006 Academy Awards, and was struck by how Bergman's film never condescends to its viewer, unlike the major nominated Politically Correct films Hollywood churns out and rewards. Three, having always known of Bergman from the films of American filmmaker Woody Allen, I was struck at just how much Allen steals from Bergman in many of his films- from camera angles and techniques, to outright theft of scenes. Not that I am accusing Allen of wrongdoing, for T.S. Eliot basically admitted that if an artist is to steal, they should steal from the greats, and Bergman crafted a great film, rife for purloining, back in 1957.The story the film tells is rather simple- it's a road film that journeys into the past and psyche of a retired widower and Professor of Medicine named Isak Borg (Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m). Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m was apparently a greatly influential actor and director in the first few decades of Swedish cinema, but by 1957 had spent a decade or more in declining reputation. This film and role sealed his immortality. It is a great performance, and one which a lesser actor could easily have gone over the top with. There is a perfect modulation to not only his performance, but to every aspect of the film, starting with Bergman's stellar screenplay. I would be hard pressed to think of a great film, or even a good one, that lacks a good screenplay. This is one of the ironies of film, versus the other visual arts- it's almost wholly dependent upon an art form, writing, with an entirely different paradigm.Bergman was wise to have his film clock in at a mere hour and a half. It is a small, personal film, despite its cosmic undertones and themes. In a sense it balances the best of the dramas of Shakespeare and Chekhov, which is where the plays of Ibsen and Strindberg, Bergman's two greatest claimed influences, reside. He also wisely fills the detritus of Borg's life with symbolism that others- in the film or out- can interpret, but to Borg are just there. In a sense, the most important scene in the film, the one which acts as a fractal refraction of the whole film, is that where Borg and his mother pick through the old box of children's things as Marianne looks coldly on, misinterpreting both mother and son for her own reasons. For this reason, Wild Strawberries stands out not only as a great piece of cinema, but its screenplay as a great piece of literature. And given the multivalence of such art as this, to skillfully combine great imagery with great storytelling in a poetic vein, it's no wonder that film has become the dominant art form of the last half century, supplanting the novel and painting, just as they had supplanted poetry and the romance. Let me end this essay where I began, lamenting the greatness of this film juxtaposed with the supposedly 'great' films that Hollywood proffered for Oscars this year. It is like comparing a rich, diverse banquet with a greasy bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken. Period. One of the complaints that I have always found valid about great art is how it is usually always too expensive for the average person to enjoy- be it paintings in swank galleries, small books of poetry several times the price of novels, outrageously priced theater and opera tickets, or even foreign films on video or DVD. This was one of the major reasons it took me so long to watch this film, because the DVD I purchased, from The Criterion Collection, retails for $39.95, while your average Hollywood blockbuster can retail for a third that, or less. Is it any wonder, then, that the masses choose swill to fill their free time? In the name of raising up the filmic awareness and appreciation for the great films of the past, foreign or domestic, like Wild Strawberries, I urge companies that distribute foreign films to do their best to make good quality DVDs of such classics available more cheaply, for there is a market to be filled with great affordable art, and once a taste of greatness is given, the market will only expand, and justify the demotic impulse to lower prices with an increased quantity of sales making up for loss of high profit margins per unit. Dover Thrift Editions in America, and Wordsworth Editions in the U.K. have proved that great books cheaply distributed is an economically viable strategy, and I believe the same is true for great films. Why should films like Wild Strawberries remain only in the province of film snobs, and not made available to compete for viewership with contemporary schlock like Brokeback Mountain or Crash simply for economic reasons? Greatness in art may exact a price from its creators, but price should not diminish art's reach. Great films like Wild Strawberries deserve to be freed to the masses, to be enjoyed and enlightened. Watch it and you will agree.",

            "content": "Mere words cannot describe what Ingmar Bergman was capable of with a camera. Certainly from a metaphysical standpoint, his films consist of the the typical images and framing nearly all other films have. Yet, on a spiritual and emotional level, his films are unlike practically any other director's. Not a single film maker today, save Woody Allen, is capable nor willing to tackle the subjects and ideas Bergman so willingly explored.In this film, we have an elderly professor on a journey to receive recognition for his life's work. In a sense, he is on his way to death as this award signifies his life is near the end. He travels by car with his daughter-in-law as well as three youths and begins having strange and powerful dreams and hallucinations. What they mean remains unclear, but what they do to our protagonist is shake to the core his foundation of beliefs. No longer does he fully accept what his past has been or what his life can be summed up as. Now, he must face the inner demons tormenting his subconscious.These were typical themes of Bergman's films and his unique visual style married his ideas perfectly. Moody, bleak cinematography filled with frightful and beautiful images create a powerful atmosphere to plunge us into. For Wild Strawberries, he makes great use of voice-over narration and flashback sequences, using them to fill in the back story as well as create a sense of disillusionment and misdirection with the audience. Many of the professor's dreams either make no sense or seem to have no relevance to the larger arc of the story. The same is true with many dreams we have. Indeed, this whole film could be seen as a dream, but when is he awake and when is he asleep? The purpose of it all is not in the end of the journey, but in the journey itself. Nearly everyone he comes into contact with symbolizes part of his life be it his son and his wife, the young hitchhikers who despair of growing old, or the bickering married couple who have an uncanny resemblance to the professor and his late wife.This is not a film to discuss, rather to watch. Most of Bergman's work is one that must be experienced fully and then talked about afterward. He is certainly one of the most fearless directors ever, never afraid to tackle issues of God, meaning of life and relationships. So many others attempt to do what he does, but none can match his eye for quality nor his mind for intelligent, coherent, philosophical dialogue. In this case, the art form is of life.",

Well I always thought that memories will vanish like \"tears in rain\", but no, since this movie I know that my memories about my family are there to bring me peace and joy.

Along the way, they come into contact with different types of people, stopping at times for a rest. The Professor falls asleep on more than one occasion, and it is during his dreams - which unlike the one at the start of the film, now seem to be retracted memories - that he begins to chip away at the ice cover around his heart.The end may come rather suddenly for some, but if you have been feeling the gist of the story as it has progressed this likely will not be the case.Another thing which some people may not like is the black and white photography. Those people would be wise to still give this film a chance - mainly because of the way Bergman can handle this particular medium: there is none of the stuffiness or atmospheric smothering that misuse of black and white brings; the sky does look bright, the youth's skin does look full of youthfulness.Keep in mind this is not a film that overbears it's message; concentrate on it from start to finish and you may just learn something of yourself.",

            "content": "I came to this movie after having watched several of Bergman's others; \"The Seventh Seal,\" \"Through a Glass Darkly,\" \"The Silence,\" and \"Winter Light,\" among others. I always had to be in the mood for one of those emotionally draining experiences, so, in a suitably heavy mindset I watched \"Wild Strawberries.\" Many of the Bergman themes are present: lost love, loneliness, marital and family dysfunction, God versus science, anxiety, isolation, and fear of death. However, the touch seemed lighter than expected, provoking only a wistful melancholy.The storyline is simple, being that of 78 year old Professor Isak Borg (Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m) traveling by car from Stockholm to Lund to receive honorary recognition for his lifetime of service in the medical profession. Initially he is accompanied on the trip by his attractive daughter-in-law, but they are joined along the way by a young girl and her two male companions as well as a bitterly cynical middle-aged couple. If you are wondering how all of the people fit into Borg's car, it is rather large and old - befitting its owner, as Borg comments. A Bergman road movie is a novelty in and of itself and makes seeing this a must for any Bergman fan.In the opening scene Borg (who narrates the film) says that he has chosen to withdraw from most personal interactions, since they seem to dwell on interminable discussions about people and their motivations which, one assumes, bore him. He remarks on this as leaving him rather lonely, but this seems more of a remark than a complaint. Early on we are treated to a Daliesque dream sequence that led me to feel that we were indeed going to go deeply into the psyche of Dr. Borg, but the ponderous tone created by the dream is not carried over into the remainder of the movie. The dream is spectacularly realized and, while I assume that Freud would have a field day with it, its meaning beyond having a life without much time left inducing a fear of loneliness and death escapes me. I think the dream sequence misleads us as to what is coming. It establishes the main premise, but sets the wrong tone. Toward the end of the movie we are offered another lengthy dream sequence - an anxiety dream about being unprepared for an examination (that is commonly experienced by most academics) together with revelations of the infidelity of Borg's long since dead wife and a searing interrogation by the wife who comments, \"You know so much, and you don't know anything.\"Sandwitched between these heavier dreams the trip itself is almost lighthearted at times, primarily due to the exuberance and beauty of the young Bibi Anderson. This is not to say that Professor Borg is not hit with some weighty accusations by his daughter-in-law, like being told he is selfish and ruthless, and that his son hates him. It is fun to see Max von Sydow playing a gas station attendant who expresses thanks to Borg for services once rendered.Probably all old people wind up in Borg's position of looking back on their lives and summing up. And there are many who have regrets about foregoing personal relationships in favor of career, as Borg does. But, in the end it is difficult to see Borg as an anguished or tragic person. He made choices, some good and some bad, just like we all do. Maybe he could have had more personal happiness with different choices, who can tell. By opting for more personal happiness, maybe his talents as an honored scientist would have been lost to society. Is the social good of a life less valuable than personal satisfaction? Besides, at an old age Borg has a devoted housekeeper who is almost a surrogate wife, he is well off, he is honored by his peers, he is still intellectually active, he is engaged enough to recite poetry, and, importantly, he is still flexible and thoughtful enough to be changed by his experiences. After his long day he has had not only sobering, wounding experiences, but also the delight in his young companions and the satisfaction of being publicly honored. He is able to integrate these experiences and, near the end of life, find peace rather than confusion and despair.Woody Allen's \"Another Woman\" has been compared to this movie. Indeed Allen's movie was surely inspired by \"Wild Strawberries,\" and I think it is the superior movie - deeper and more involving.",

Bergman's use of light and dark scenes to create a sense of the character and atmosphere is wonderfully achieved in this outstanding film of the late 1950s. The opening scene of the movie provides the viewer an excellent synopsis of Dr. Isak Borg's life and family. The scene acquaints the viewer with his son, mother, house keeper, deceased wife and the doctor himself. The first dream by Dr. Borg is dark and puzzling due mainly to its unclear meaning and uncanny nature. The street is deserted and clear. Dr. Borg approaches a clock and looks, but it is without hands. He looks at his pocket watch and it is also without hands. The black and white scene is subdued and calm, but draws the viewer in all the while guessing what's next. The scene is without music and progresses with the sound of a heart beat that quickens with each step taken as he walks along the desolate boulevard. When Dr. Borg approaches a man, the man turns and lacks a face. Shortly after, a cart-drawn casket passes and knocks its wheel off after colliding with a lamp post. The casket falls, opens, and a hand hangs exposed. Dr. Borg approaches the casket preparing to look inside when the hand reaches and clutches his hand. Surprised and frightened, he struggles to free the grip and soon recognizes that the face of the man in the casket is his own.The movie was filled with Dr. Borg's puzzling dreams and remembrances of his early life, but much of the charm and warmth that is contained throughout the movie is owed to the secondary characters. Dr. Borg's daughter-in-law, Marianne is a delight to watch because she can smile like an angle and can be bluntly frank, all at the same time. Her stunning classic looks and assured mannerism helps the movie in a great way. Agda has lived with the doctor as his housekeeper for forty years. She and Dr. Borg hysterically argues as if man and wife. She knows the doctor well and understands him like the other people in his life do not. Sara, the young girl who wakes the doctor as he lay near the wild strawberries is a joy to watch. She shows the doctor new ways to look at the world by not taking anything too seriously. She takes in all that life has to offer and brings out the joy. Her slight touch to the doctor's face while they drove is one of the warmest scenes in the film and defines her loving character. There are many warm moments in the film, and many moments of darkness. The beginning of the film was dark, puzzling, and melancholy, and the end of the film was warm, bright and full of life and tenderness. The movie brought to mind, Charles Dickens' Scrooge, from A Christmas Carol. Although Professor Borg was not nearly as cold and unpleasant as Mr. Scrooge, he did however isolate and distance himself from his wife, friends, and family. His cruelty was hidden by his charm, but affected people quite similar to Mr. Scrooge's nasty mannerisms. On several occasions, in dreams and reality, Dr. Borg had to endure scrutiny from family members about his coldness. While driving to Lund, Marianne charmingly reminded him of his lack of warmth, love, and understanding and how she only knows him as a father-in-law. Marianne also lets on to Dr. Borg that his own son hates him; words that rang in the doctor's head. The doctor's dreams pointed out to him how he isolated the important parts of life and the people who cared for him. During one of Dr. Borg's dreams, he was taken by a teacher to see his dead wife. She was in a grassy field where she was making love to another man. Afterwards, she sat there talking to the man about her husband not caring, not giving her the attention she needed and how he would dismiss the entire event as his fault, but she says he does not mean any of it, because \"he is cold as ice.\" Dr. Borg also became puzzled by a pocket watch that once belonged to his father. His mother showed him the watch and had wanted to give it to her grandson. The watch was missing the hands, just as the one in his dream. Throughout the movie, Dr. Borg let more and more of his old ways die and by the end of the day he was beginning to live and be happy. The crabby old coot that emerged at the beginning of the movie, softened and begin to see how happy he could be if he allowed himself. The Drive with the good people that Dr. Borg was fortunate to have accompany him, allowed him to experience the love and joy of others.",

            "content": "For anyone just starting with Bergman, they should have a look on the Wild Strawberries. It's a perfect film to understand Bergman's philosophical standpoint and how he used it to create cinematic masterpieces one after the other.The film follows an old worried man who've spent his whole life as a cold arctic plate. If we look around ourselves, such characters are not in dearth, but rarely have we found films which provide a character study of such sort. Bergman not only gives us a realistic portrayal of Isak Borg, but he also uses him to put forward the profound ideas of death, religion, and family.Apart from having a very well-written screenplay, Wild Strawberries is so good on its visuals that dialogues appear to be ornamentations rather than a necessity. In the very first scenes, for example, the constant ticking of clock, close-ups, lonely roads in the dream sequence, and details as such tell a lot about the character even without any lines.Bergman also utilizes few other characters such as Marianne, Isak's mother, the three friends, a middle aged couple among others to reflect life to Isak. The coldness of his mother, the unhappy marriage life of the couple, the liveliness of the friends, and the effects of having a cold companion which Marianne depicts: all of these force Isak to accept the emotional constraints he has put on himself in the past. He is going to get an honour, but his lifeBut he is not an evil of any kind. The brief scene involving Max von Sydow tell us about the humanitarian aspect of the old man. After around 90 minutes with him, we see hope as the camera captures his calm demeanor in a beautiful closeup.Wild Strawberries is a beautiful film, one which stays with you for long, and makes you look for yourself in a moment or conflict in the film.",

            "review_title": "Another Bergman Road Movie",
            "content": "Veteran filmmaker Victor Sjostrom plays Dr Isak Borg, a man who has shunned social contact where possible, who is nearing the end of his life. Borg decides to drive to the other end of the country to collect an honorary doctorate in recognition of his work, and is accompanied by his daughter-in-law, Marianne (Ingrid Thulin). Although Borg is supposed to be something of a misanthropist, he doesn't really come across as one in the film; in fact he comes across as quite a pleasant old chap. This could be because of a dream he recently had in which he wanders deserted city streets before coming across a clock with no hands and a carriage containing a coffin within which lies his own body. It's an undeniably powerful sequence \u2013 and must have been even more so back in 1957 \u2013 and it indicates to both Isak and the audience that death is not far away.This realisation triggers a series of hallucinations which cause Isak to re-assess his life, and the incidents that resulted in him becoming the way he is. We learn that the woman he really loved left him for another man, an act which he perhaps has regarded as one of feckless cruelty, but which his hallucination informs us was actually a tortuous decision.Isak and Marianne stop on the way to visit Isak's 96-year-old mother who lives alone, and largely unvisited, in a detached old house. There is little intimacy between mother and son, and it becomes evident that Isak was an unwanted child (much like Bergman). It's perhaps easy, then, to see the genetic conditioning that led Isak down the path he chose.The film continues in this revelatory vein for its relatively brief running time, and it is never less than an intelligent and absorbing tale. Isak and Marianne pick up hikers on their travels: a young girl \u2013 played by Bibi Andersson, who also plays Sara, Isak's lost love \u2013 and her two male companions, whose situation mirrors that of Isak's Sara, and a bickering married couple, with whom Isak relates because they remind him of his own troubled marriage to a wife long dead.Wild Strawberries is one of those films that tempts the viewer into ever deeper thought: the more you think about it, the more you realise you've yet to uncover. The best films are like this: you keep peeling away one layer only to reveal another underneath \u2013 and while they don't provide the visceral thrill of more popular films, they are undoubtedly infinitely more rewarding. The subject matter might be grim \u2013 coming to terms with the imminent end of one's life, the nature of death, and the perilous path misinformed decisions can lead us down \u2013 but Wild Strawberries isn't a depressing film. It's not exactly uplifting, either, but it has something to say, and says it in an intelligent and insightful way. Victor Sjostrom, whose last film this would be, gives a near perfect performance as old Isak. He was 78 when the film was made \u2013 the same age as the character he plays \u2013 and in poor health, a fact which ironically enhances the realism of his performance.",

We see Isak, an old doctor who, on his way of receiving a honorary award, is confronted with his entire life, and the way that life changed him. He realizes that he aid his selfishness with loneliness, and that time took away his joy to live. The characters of Isak's mother, on one side, and Marianne and Evald on the other, remind us that this drama is recurrent in every human life, like a self-repeating prophecy that haunts all generations: Is it worth living? Should we even bother bringing new creatures to this meaningless world? How can we avoid falling into the trap of loneliness eventually?On their trip to Lund, Isak and Marianne pick up two very different groups of people. First, there's Sara, Viktor and Anders; young, happy, and cheerful. They are still innocent and worried about the existence of God and the beauty of art. Then, they pick up a bitter married couple that are constantly arguing with each other. These passengers mirror Isak's stages in life, from his cheerful youth to an already cynical marriage, the path that Marianne and Evald also seem to be taking. It is meaningful, then, that Marianne forces the married couple to leave the car. In the end, what prevails is the desire to live happily.Though, like all Bergman's movies, the plot moves a bit too slowly for modern audiences' taste, this should not overshadow the depth of this movie, so rarely found in today's cinema. Wild Strawberries is an insightful movie that brings us all to the bottom of human existence.",

You won't have a clue about the meaning of life, the real essence of it- the WILD STRAWBERRIES of YOUR life. To comprehend this last phrase, you will have to think of the wild strawberries as they stand in the Scandinavian countries (where this movie comes from). They are pretty rare to find. If and when you find them, they won't even put out your hunger (as any other food, easily found in your refrigerator would accomplish). You don't really need them. But that's the whole point, the true value they carry.The film begins with Isak Borg making a trip to another town to get an award for his great achievements as a doctor. But, unexpectedly, this journey will be of a very different nature. He will pass from known places that will wake up memories well hidden in the unconscious, places which will take care for the development of this nature. He will meet personas who will play a part in this. He will go through situations that will ring a revealing bell of truth, they will be a strong reality check... for him and the audience...Ingmar Bergman, with his flawless masterpiece, presents to us the meaning of life in something like 90 minutes. Many films, especially in the '00s, have tried to walk through this path, but we easily reach the conclusion that they have achieved very little as we watch wild strawberries. In the same time, Bergman gives us a punch in the face. It's a painful procedure; to see what really counts and then realise you haven't valued it as you should all the previous years of your life until this moment of realisation. That you have not given it the time and space that fits to it, that you have spent your time and emotional space (the only things that really belong to you in this world) in other unimportant matters (like arguing about the existence of god ;-) ). Bergman's \"wild strawberries\" have a sublime flavor and during their digestion comes real personal valuation and change. I have seen hundreds of movies, but this is the one I always looked for.

The technical brilliance is visible throughout but this journey is driven by character interactions & revelations.Through its protagonist, the film treads on existential themes such as mortality, ageing, aloneness, self-reflection, faith & forgiveness, and consistently switches from present events to past reminiscences. Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m delivers an excellent, assured & committed performance. The graceful demeanour in his rendition just works, and he is finely supported by the rest.Overall, Wild Strawberries is going to be a very arresting, engaging & rewarding experience for anyone who find themselves interested & invested in the leading character's trip down memory lane.

Sometimes it is hard to label a dream if it is a nightmare; I think Isak's dreams are that kind of dreams.The essence of this movie is the loneliness and emptiness of the modern human in the modern world; as we see Isak as the symbol of modern human and his life as the modern world.\nThrough the movie, Isak dreams about five parts of his life and many different people. Whenever he dreams about his childhood the scene gets brighter with more people around him, but as he grows up the loneliness makes his friendship stronger.\nOn the road, Isak meets Sara, who recalls the memories of an old love named Sara and two other boys, one is an atheist and another one is going to be a priest. These three people are the symbol of three ways of looking at life; life with or without god and life with focusing on pleasure and lust.One of his dreams is about being questioned about his knowledge. At first, he was questioned about his expertise and he couldn't answer; this is a sarcasm to the appreciation medal that he will be given. At the end of the Interrogation, he was questioned to read what is written on the board, but he wasn't able to read that. The inscription that was written on the board was the simplest thing that every human must know: \"apologize for something wrong that you have done\"; this is a sarcasm to the way modern human lives.In the end, we can't be sure if all of the scenes were a dream or not; if Isak was alive or not! as we see many symbols of death, such as casket, sleep, and handless clock.",

Ingmar Bergman gives a masterful direction and his b&w work is so superior to other directors that all scenes are impressive. A cruel, touching story about an old man who has to confront loneliness and aging. A must see for any Bergman fan and for all the people who are looking for great films. One thing i noticed in Bergman's films is that he has kinda an obsession for wild strawberries, watch \"The Seventh Seal\" and you'll agree with me.10/10",

            "content": "\"Wild Strawberries\", Ingmar Bergman's classic film in which an elderly physician examines his life while traveling to receive an honorary award for his years of service is probably not a household name, but it should be seen. Professor Isak Borg (Sjostrom) has been living alone for years with only his housekeeper to keep him company, as he has alienated his grown son and his daughter in law. His cold demeanor and brusque mannerisms don't help to win him many friends, so on the advent of the award ceremony, while his daughter in law drives him there he reflects on his past and things that happened/decisions he made that led him to become the man he has, and led to the life he is living. Whether they are nightmarish dreams about death, or bona fide memories he experiences while they visit his childhood home along the way, each occurrence makes him more introspective (and a bit frightened) about his life and the lives of those around him.\"Clarity\" is not the first word that comes to mind when I think of Bergman, but the words \"introspective\" and \"provocative\" do. \"Wild Strawberries\" was like a less sentimental \"Goodbye Mr. Chips\", and even has some similarities to \"Deconstructing Harry\". After experiencing Bergman films like \"The Seventh Seal\", I was expecting there to be a lot of room for interpretation, and what I got was a beautiful, interesting and thought-provoking study of a man who didn't realize all that he had lost until he finally allowed himself (or forced himself, depending on which way you want to look at it) to come to terms with certain turning points in his life, some of which he had complete control over, and some which were decided for him.Bergman's black and white cinematography is gorgeous and artful, and Sjostrom's performance is heartfelt and natural. The supporting cast is good as well. If you're trying to get someone to get into Bergman films, this may be a good warm-up before exposing them to \"The Seventh Seal\" or even \"Persona\". With \"Wild Strawberries\", Bergman proves once again that he is one of the most thought-provoking and creative directors of the 20th century. I would definitely recommend this film. 7/10 --Shelly",

As Isak looks back at his life, he has the horrifying realization that his life has been meaningless.

Isak realizes he needs to let emotion in, and in the end he is at peace with himself at last. \tThis film was very well made and directed.

            "content": "I remember, back when I was in high school, I was just starting to get into film, at least as more than just a cheap way to kill a couple of hours. I'd heard a lot about Bergman, about how he was one of the all-time greats, so I decided to watch \"The Seventh Seal\". Frankly, I wasn't overly impressed. I've seen it again since then, and I liked it a lot better the second time, but my first impression was disappointment. But not long afterward, I decided to get back on the horse and give Bergman one more shot. The second movie I tried was \"Wild Strawberries\", and that was another story altogether.The story is a relatively simple one. Professor Isak Borg (Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m), an aging physician, is traveling to Lund to receive an honorary degree. Accompanying him is his daughter-in-law, Marianne (Ingrid Thulin). Along the way, they make various acquaintances \u2013 a trio of young travelers, an embittered married couple, Borg's mother, a former patient, etc. Each of these encounters recalls some memory, some event in Borg's life, recollections of his childhood, his family, his estranged wife, his boyhood sweetheart. Over the course of the film, Borg's life is reconstructed before our eyes, and through HIS eyes, we see our own questions being asked, our own tribulations being explored.The film has its share of many typical Bergman trademarks: psychology, existential angst, questions of the existence of God, strange dream sequences, feelings of loneliness, and an exploration of the apparent meaninglessness of life. But at the same time, the film has a warmth that you don't often get from Bergman, as well as glimmers of hope, a sense that maybe all isn't lost after all.The acting is solid throughout, and the performance delivered by Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m is particularly touching, portraying a tired, trouble man, struggling with his own stubborn, judgmental, alienating tendencies.I've seen many Bergman films since I first saw \"Wild Strawberries\", and he's come to be one of my favorite directors, but to this day, \"Wild Strawberries\" is my favorite of his films. To me, it's one of his most cohesive, well-conceived, clearly executed films, and its impact survives repeated viewings. I recommend it highly, especially to people who are new to Bergman, or who watched another of his films and weren't impressed.",

Some of the techniques, both in story telling and in visual stimuli are very dated. Although I can appreciate the care and attention to detail utilized in the making of the film it does not deliver anything that I have not seen before. Mostly it conveys a familiar message in an time and tradition that may have been ground breaking in it's day but is not now. The photography is beautiful. The characters are not singular in their originality or their behavior. I recognize many of the actors from other Bergman films such as the Magician, The Seventh Seal and the Virgin Spring. This is a nice little movie about an old man reflecting on his past on an important date in his life. Good but not necessarily a classic. Classic in the sense that it is from a classic era of film making and by a heralded director no less but it does not reside in my top 100 movies of all time. Perhaps that opinion is a byproduct of my era? Perhaps it's not. There are other films made before this one that I regard much more highly. Gone with the wind, Double Indemnity, Spellbound, Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Sunrise, Pride of the Yankees, Key Largo and 12 Angry Men are all old films yet they suit my sensibilities better.",

Basically seventy-eight year old physician and professor of medicine Dr. Isak Borg (BAFTA nominated Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m) is travelling from Stockholm to Lund to receive an honorary award for fifty years in medical practice. He is joined on the journey by his daughter-in-law Marianne (Ingrid Thulin), and along the way he tells how he has been having strange dreams, nightmares and hallucinations, and this returns again. These nightmares include clocks with faces but no hands, runaway hearses, an open coffin with his own body coming out, and of course the meaningful summers he spent with cousin Sara (Bibi Andersson) and stuff. Slipping back and forth, in and out of these questionable places, he realises choices he made int he past involving him, his love life and ultimately his family have created a lonely life. He finds he has no real purpose for living without his children and love in his life (family and passionate together), thankfully he achieves redemption, and the forgiveness and love from his children. Also starring Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand as Dr. Evald Borg, Jullan Kindahl as Agda, Folke Sundquist as Anders, Bj\u00f6rn Bjelfvenstam as Viktor, Naima Wifstrand as Isak's Mother and a brief Max Von Sydow as Henrik \u00c5kerman. This Swedish film has many weird and wonderful moments, especially during the dream sequences, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m is a good choice for the leading character, and even though it was hard to keep up with the dream and reality placings, it is certainly a must see foreign drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film.

Bergman uses dreams and allegorical images and characters to support his thesis that the greatest waste of a life is to live it in isolation.\"Wild Strawberries\" is also light and humorous in places, with a gentle and loving depiction of the doctor's family in his youth (though I think it's important that we never see the doctor interacting with his past family until the very end).  He is ultimately redeemed at the end, and Bergman is saying, I think,  that there is hope for us to change even until the very end of our lives, and that change is worth undertaking.On the whole, \"Wild Strawberries\" makes an affirmative statement.  One of the strengths of this movie, and of Bergman's work in general, is his ability to create characters who function successfully as both \"types\" -- embodiments of ideas, philosophies or points of view -- and also as credible individuals in a narrative about whom we care.

            "content": "Wild Strawberries\nDir. Ingmar Bergman\n(1957)I must first preface this review by telling you that I am 15 years old as of two weeks ago. During quarantine I was often extremely bored because of the minimal school work I was receiving and the repetitive nature of the video games I was playing. As an escape to try and find something better to do with my time I began watching movies. I started out with some of the very highest IMDB rated movies that interested me. The Shawshank Redemption, The Godfather Trilogy, Schindler's List, One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest, Pulp Fiction and Fight Club. I was amazed and completely riveted by the new emotions and worlds I was experiencing. As time went on I attempted to expand my taste and watch some new and unfamiliar styles/types of film making. I wanted to watch some classics so I watched 12 Angry Men (A personal favorite), Casablanca, and Citizen Kane. I was dissatisfied with my opinions on these films because with the exception of 12 Angry Men, they weren't all that enjoyable. Sure, I could see where these films got some of the praise from because they were certainly well made all around. But where was the enjoyment factor? Are \"classics\" not meant to be enjoyed, but rather be discussed in film school In front of a bored class? Last night my entire perspective on that question changed. I had given The Seventh Seal a go sometime In June and was absolutely bored out of my mind and felt like a total idiot. From that point on I felt intimidated and nervous to start a film by a director like Tarkovsky, Kurosawa, or Bergman. For some reason while scrolling through my HBO Max watchlist last night, I decided to watch Wild Strawberries. Wild Strawberries is truly a remarkable stamp on film making and deserves more respect than it gets. The story is touching and human, something everybody can relate with. I don't want to talk about this movie more than I should. After all, I went into Wild Strawberries blind and I wouldn't have wanted to experience it any other way. If you have read my review up to this point and haven't seen Bergman's masterpiece that Is Wild Strawberries, check it out. It's firmly in my ten favorite films of all time and is enjoyable beyond belief.",

I laughed aloud several times during the film at the interactions between the very real seeming characters. The protagonist learns something about life during the progress of his journey. The dream sequences, far from being tedious or thrumming me on the head with their symbolism, are, to my mind, the most accurate depiction of the dream state I've seen on film. In no way is this film dated. (except, perhaps in that the beautiful women seem normal size rather than the unhealthily thin monstrosities we are forced to watch these days).Watching this (the Criterion collection version with subtitles) has made me want to see more Bergman films to see if any of the optimism and accuracy of this film are in his other films.",

I still graded it much higher than wild strawberries.Here, the acting is excellent, the directing is unsurprisingly excellent too. The storyline is very profound so are the dialogs and before all there's grace. Although the soundtrack is disappointing and the photography still doesn't deserve any awe.I was interested by this story of an old man looking back at his life; some people compared it to About Schmidt, on a similar subject it's true, but not as profound. An equally profound movie on this subject that I think is superior (despite some slow and long passages) is ETERNITY AND A DAY by Theo Angelopoulos. Bruno Ganz moves me much more than Sjostrom and the symbols all along make the dreams more subtle. The photography is better and the discreet soundtrack accompanies magnificently the pictures.In conclusion, wild Strawberries is a very good movie but we may have done better since and it seems to me that it's a little bit overrated.",

The great ones that I've seen tend to stare straight at the face of this depressing subject: \"Tokyo Story\", \"Make Way for Tomorrow\", \"Amour\", and \"Ikiru\". \"Wild Strawberries\", while probably one of Bergman's more straightforward and accessible films, is for sure the most abstract and surreal of the films mentioned here.Close to the beginning, there is a dreadful dream sequence. Dr. Isak Borg, an old man who will be receiving an honorary degree for his work next morning, is lost on empty streets that he doesn't recognize. He is alone, as he is in life, searching for a person (or place) that he knows. He sees a clock with no hand ticking away, symbolizing his impending death, although he doesn't know when it will happen. He sees a man at the end of the street and approaches him, only to have him drop dead right in front of him. A carriage then drives by and drops a coffin with an arm sticking out. Isak grabs it and is pulled in by his own dead body.Isak knows he is going to die alone, and although all he wants is a friend (\"Where is the friend I seek?\"), it is much too late for him. To console himself he thinks back to his peaceful memories, surrounded by family, and even though that time wasn't without its share of problems, he was loved by a woman that he loved, and he was young with his whole life ahead of him. Now that it's behind him, he is finally beginning to realize his mistakes, almost subconsciously, while on a car ride with his daughter-in-law and three hitchhikers.After being told about how cold and distant he has become, opposed to his youth in which he was kind, he begins to become introspective. After almost being killed in a car accident, they pick up the couple who's car has broken down. They find out the wife is constantly upset and the man is totally indifferent, and after being asked to leave the car, the wife asks for forgiveness. Later, after finding out about his son's pessimistic reaction to the news of his wife being pregnant, Isak reveals that the couple reminded him of his marriage, and Marianne declares that is not what she wants her relationship with her husband to become. Isak doesn't know how to respond. He has just had a dream in which he is confronted by his innermost fear: that he is destined to be alone because of his past mistakes. He is told that \"A doctor's first duty is to ask forgiveness\". We see a memory of Isak's in which his (now dead) wife has sex, and then describes how Isak will react: cold and distant. When she asks for forgiveness, Isak doesn't grant it. One thing it seems that he can't do is ask for forgiveness or grant it to others. He is too indifferent to do that, and this results in his ultimate loneliness during his old age, when all he wants is a friend. Even after he tells his maid that he's sorry, and then asks if he can call her by her first name, she denies him because they are too old for that and they need to live up to their reputation. While at the end he does seem hopeful for his son and daughter-in-law, who seem to be sticking together out of love, all he truly has left is his sweet, innocent memories.This is, in my opinion, Bergman's best film. The way in which he frames and edits the many excursions into dream or memory is so perfect, the symbolic meaning and poignancy of the dreams and memories, the performances are heartbreaking and incredibly believable, and the many small nuances added, such as the world around Isak darkening in one particular moment in which he essentially realizes how little he understands and controls about life and the world. It is a hopeful but sad film about the end of life and all that comes with it: the regret, longing, loneliness, and hope.",

Some of his films are only a showing of symbolism, such as The Seventh Seal, this one is also very artsy, though it doesn't sacrifice traditional narrative.But I didn't found it very entertaining. The low visual quality hurt, as the fact that it is black and white (I simply do not like black and white very much: color makes things much better looking) and the score was also very uninteresting.Overall, I would recommend it for someone who likes artsy drama films.

            "content": "The actor, screenwriter and director Victor Sj\u00f6strom was a major figure in the silent film of the early 20th century. Decades later, when film had long since transitioned to talkies and Sj\u00f6strom had disappeared from the scene, focusing instead on theatre, Ingmar Bergman called him back for the 1957 effort WILD STRAWBERRIES. And instead of trying to evoke the great achievements of Sj\u00f6strom's younger days, Bergman let this now 78-year-old man depict with no holds barred what old age and the thought of imminent death are really like.As the film opens, we are introduced to Professor Isak Borg (Sj\u00f6strom), who started out as a provincial doctor but made some new medical discoveries and established a shining career in academia. Borg must travel to the distant Swedish city of Lund to accept an honorary degree from the university there, and he decides to drive the whole distance. He is accompanied by his daughter-in-law Marianne (Ingrid Thulin), who had been staying with him after a row with Borg's son Evald, and who eventually takes the wheel for the old man. Along the way they pick up three young hitchhikers, and later they get into a fender-bender with an unhappy married couple.Initially Borg's housekeeper and Marianne are puzzled that the elderly professor wants to drive all that way, but we soon discover that the route passes some places from Borg's younger days. Flashbacks that are shown during stops, and the professor's own dreams as he doses off, reveal feelings of regret and guilt that the old man had been harbouring all his life. The three hitchhikers in the bloom of youth remind Borg even more sharply of his elderly state, and the married couple only serves as a reminder of his own unhappy family life. He is tormented by the thought that he has little time left to set things right with those close to him that he had alienated years, even decades, before.WILD STRAWBERRIES is very touching, and it is one of those films where the main character is played in such a great bit of acting that all the other details hardly matter. Still, the supporting roles are memorable. Bibi Andersson plays two roles that are worlds apart. In one, Andersson is the main hitchhiker character, a sort of liberated woman and tomboy. The other role is Borg's early love interest, a woman reflective of upper-class society in early 20th-century Sweden with all its strict ideas about proper female behaviour. Other longtime members of Bergman's stable appear: Max von Sydow as a rural petrol station attendant, and Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand as Borg's son that takes all too after the old man.In spite of the film's strengths, I must admit that WILD STRAWBERRIES is not among my favourite Bergman efforts. It seems especially flawed by one subplot: among the hitchhikers that Borg takes, two of them are always squabbling about whether God exists. I find this bears very little relationship with the protagonist's dilemma (Borg himself doesn't muse on what they say), and instead it's like Bergman was trying to shoehorn in the religious themes of his other major films of this era, such as THE SEVENTH SEAL. Still, even what I feel to be lesser Bergman is still great cinema, and I imagine most viewers will enjoy this poignant tale.",

What struck me then was how close Bergman came to evoking the atmosphere of those dreams that linger with us for years or decades. And the atmosphere in which our oldest and most cherished memories are wrapped. Probably the most 'atmospheric' movie I've ever seen. I concur with the reviewer who called it the very, very best. This was my impression as an adolescent -- I look forward to seeing it again when my copy arrives, and re-evaluating it as an old man (like old Isaak).There will, of course always be those who prefer their Quentin Tarantinos, just as there are those who prefer to open their nuts with ten-pound hammers.",

With his daughter-in-law and a few other passengers joining in on the trek, Professor Borg faces down his own loneliness and must reckon with the factors that caused it. Against the backdrop of societal recognition for notable professional accomplishment, Isak Borg confronts his own profound shortcomings as a human being.Shot with innovative camerawork and told through a series of expertly interweaved memories, dreams, and present-day encounters, Wild Strawberries plants the viewer in the shoes of Professor Borg, forcing us to ask the same fundamental questions about life.

Opposed to the majority of films that I have seen that piece by Bergman really touched me even though I have not understood many of the underlying conflicts. In spite of the difficulty and seriousness of the topics dealt with in this film one does not feel depressed or empty towards the end of the film. I guess this is because of the artistic brilliance evoked by the actors and the camera. I am not familiar with film analysis and I won't go into formal details for that reason. I am grateful to Bergman for the film because it makes you realize that all the hardship and heaviness of love and facing oneself is in a way natural and a universal task that everyone seeking for these things has to accept. I am still quite young and naive but I believe that love in one form or the other might be that one idea that can sort of tame that inner longing or drive for other things or beings, which could not be stopped otherwise. Thanks to people like Bergman I realize that misery and all the other negative feelings one can think are more part of the process than something one has to avoid as good as possible. I enjoy beauty and that film was just that. My favorite shot was the close up of Isak's face staring at the moon after he saw Sara, the love of his life and his brother Sigfrid happily in their share living room.

But quickly the beautiful black and white photography caught my eye and I was drawn into Isak Borg's story, or rather, his self-examination.The progression of the film is fantastic. Early in the film, Isak has an apparition within a dream and the small events leading up to it, within the dream, are quite brilliant. Throughout the rest of the film there are dreams and recollections; newly discovered secrets of the past that Isak sees for the first time. As he says in the film, \"Dreams, as if I must tell myself something I won't listen to when I'm awake.\" How Bergman shows us the characters is terrific. It's a like a relaxed puzzle that doesn't emphasize any sort of urgency to figure things out. The story unfolds beautifully as we get a deeper sense of Isak, who I assume is an alter ago of Ingmar Bergman at that stage of his life (he was thirty-nine when the film was released).It pains me to know that the majority of people my age would rather watch an Adam Sandler movie or \"The Rock\" than something like this. Hey, I liked \"Big Daddy\" and I love Nicolas Cage, but \"Wild Strawberries\" is one of the few films I've seen that could possibly change the way I live my life. I'm always interested in listening to what aged people have to say about their own life because, well, it can only give me tips about my own, and that's what this film does in a way.There is one sequence in the film that is frightening and \"arty,\" and I don't completely grasp what it means beyond Isak's deterioration and his realization of how people actually feel towards him (he's told earlier in the film as well, but he seems to accept this \"verdict\" more readily), but it doesn't take away from the film; rather, it's an interesting addition to an otherwise satisfying experience. In fact, it's probably the most vital part of the movie -- Isak may not like it, bbut once he gets past it, he has the option to develop.I don't know if the film is a masterpiece -- it's my introduction to Bergman, so once I see \"Cries and Whispers,\" \"Fanny and Alexander,\" \"Persona\" and \"The Seventh Seal\" (if I can get through it, this time) I'll come back to this film with a new perspective, or at least see it as a part of Bergman's whole. I do think this is a great film of its type. It's the kind of film that may require viewings every five or so years, as a sort of reminder.Pauline Kael once said that she didn't think much of Bergman because she'd done her share of soul-wrestling and it wasn't that difficult. The film isn't as challenging as I was expecting it to be, in fact, it's a walk in the park. It's pleasant and rich and beautiful, and the title seems perfect after you've seen the film. It's all about wild strawberries.",

What is the purpose of life? To just have fun and enjoy your time on this planet?Wild Strawberries is a commendable film since it displays the inner conflicts we all go through to seek meaning. No one really knows what their time on Earth is for. At the end of the day, will we be satisfied with all we have done and left undone? Movies generally focus on entertainment and try to provide a platform for audiences to enjoy themselves and superficially relate with characters. I truly believe the connection viewers built with Isak was a deeper one since this misunderstood elderly man is just trying to find his way in life like we all are.

Borg's character challenges the stigma \"the older, the wiser\" due to his sterile personality and obviously stubborn disposition\u2014he is emotionally unavailable for the majority of the story. However, in contrast, the film as a whole represents the sad and inevitable changes one endures over a lifetime and is amazingly quite human.

On his journey he meets Sara (Bibi Andersson), Anders (Folke Sundquist), and Viktor (Bj\u00f6rn Bjelfvenstam) who help him reminisce his younger days on his journey to redeem himself of this lonely existence.The movie's starting sequence with a dream which shows Dr. Borg's death catapults the movie along with the changes in the character, and though the usage of such a scene is a little risky as it can change the tone, it truly was dealt in such a way that it maintained the heartwarming effect of the movie.The beauty of this film lies in the development of the character, Dr. Isak Borg, and this is largely done by best utilizing the characters around him. In fact the 180 degree turn in the character of Marianne Borg (Ingrid Thulin), Isak's daughter-in-law, is noteworthy as she starts the film expressing her disliking towards Dr. Isak Borg and ends the film by expressing her love towards as Dr. Isak Borg. A similar technique is used with the introduction of the hitchhikers (Sara, Anders, and Viktor) who each cause a different memory from Dr. Borg's life to be remembered and it is these memories and making sense of them that causes Dr. Isak Borg to a warmer, more compassionate person.The newly found warmth running through him causes him to change his relationships at the end of the film upon receiving his honorary degree. He treats his housekeeper Agda (Jullan Kindahl) with more care and respect, and then shares some warm words with his son, Evald Borg (Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand), which completes his turn around. The writing is what truly makes this film such a classic.On the more technical side, it was quite nice to see the way the movie was edited. The movie isn't easy to make an easy watch as it has multiple sequences where Dr. Isak Borg is dreaming and reminiscing some childhood memories, so quality editing is required to help pull this off in a convincing way. The movie editing is truly convincing and the shots are placed so that it is quite clear when the character is entering a dream or memory through some slight visual effects available at the time. Including Dr. Isak Borg in his present appearance into those past memories was a fine touch to help the viewer follow along.Overall, this is a heartwarming movie which captures the development of a character from a cold, lonely state to a state of more warmth and compassion to help him mend his relationships with his family and household members. Despite being a slower film, it manages to create a heartwarming feeling that makes it a movie worth watching.",

That's the journey optimistically answered by director Ingram Bergman in this masterpiece.Professor Isak Borg, a 78-year-old man goes on a car journey along with her daughter in law from Stockholm to Lund to be honoured for 50 years of his doctorate from Lund University. We see him going through some nightmare and daydreams which somehow relates to upcoming events and his past life which is beautifully picturized. In his lost dreams, we get to know Sara, who got disturbed between the love and life of Isak and Sigfrid. And in the same parallel present world, we see one more Sara (both Sara played by Bibi Andersson) who is also confused between her two mates, and they go along together on the journey. In starting, Borg seems to be a rigid old man, but as the journey goes on, he turned out to be a beautiful soul lost into his dreams and reality as we get to know mainly in the oil station scene where a couple working there thanks to him for whatever he had done for them.There are many visible and hidden messages in the story like - A couple that came along with them after an accident turned out to be very negative and later not allowed to be the part of the journey, which showed how negative people are present in life but should not be entertained. The movie also portrays that It doesn't take much to be good enough for the world if human intentions are good. Even if you don't get something in your life, it's not the end there will be something better always waiting for you. Although there are many more incidents and messages present in this masterpiece that words won't be enough to narrate them here.Very moody lighting and smooth direction with a well-written script made it an easy watch. Through the journey, some locations are picturized very intensely which makes it more beautiful.This is a must watch at different stages and ages for all human beings and humanity to find themselves and the true meaning of life.

I don't understand why this film is known as Classic for years when there actually nothing like deep thought or self realisation in it. An old professor, Isak who has been a cold guy all his life recalls the events happened in his life during a journey to University where he is going to recieve an honour. Those main real events of his life didn't look so sad as they are shown or acknowledged in the film. In young age he is in love with the girl Sara who adores him for being tender but marries his Brother instead. Was that so big fault here? Then Isak marries to another woman who is not happy with him being cold and does not hesitate to accept having an affair outside, but after all Iska being cold doesn't really care about it. She dies (god knows how) and Isak spend rest of his life lonely. His mother and son are similar in nature and that's why lonely in thier lives. So what's the big deal being Cold? Actually Isak was loved for being Kind by some people then what's the big deal if he couldn't have any woman in life? Does that really make enough ingredients for a film that is Called Classic? I doubt. Actually there is nothing much wrong being cold as far as you're smart and honest and there are many such people in the world then i don't understand why this small issue has been treated as if it means all the life of a man. Isak never looked a bad or an evil guy in the film so his self realisation of loneliness doesn't make much sense and that too when he has almost finished living his life. I am still trying to figure out why this film got tremendous acclaim and what's there which is so much life-changing or thought provoking in the film. This film isn't gonna change a bit in my life then what's the outcome of it? I would like to recommend this film as a decent watch but Classic? Not by far, at least for me.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest",

His fear is visceral but there's no raw insight to back it up. Maybe he was a simpleton in a gentleman's clothing. I didn't understand the reason for the title though. Regardless, Wild Strawberries didn't come even close to dislodging 12 Angry Men as my favorite movie of 1957, let alone the best film of all time.

            "content": "Despite the amount of weight Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries brings to the table, there's an incredible amount of ease and earnestness in its story, blooming from its leads and the overall subject matter that it so brilliantly handles. Unlike his previous effort, The Seventh Seal, made the same year as this, Bergman unfolds more of a Charles Dickens-esque story, more centered on the modern world rather than the Middle Ages, and a one about how a man can see his childhood memories with piercing clarity, yet can not fathom or even begin to be piece together his present life.The man is Professor Isak Borg, played by the marvelous director Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m. Isak is the bossy and stubborn professor of bacteriology, who resides in a small home with just a house maid for company. He must make the lengthy trip from Stockholm to Lund to receive an honorary degree after graduating from Lund University fifty years ago. Ingrid Thulin is Marianne, his pregnant daughter-in-law who is planning to divorce her husband once the baby is born. She views her father-in-law much like the rest of the world; snotty, ungrateful, and unimportant.It is during this long car trip that Isak begins to see through to his inner-self. This newfound exercise is assisted by three different groups of people he encounters. One is the relationship with his close family, which is closed-off to his mother, daughter-in-law, and son. Another is with people he encounters while on the road, like a bickering married couple, who relationship is apparently physically and verbally abusive, along with a group of young hikers. And the final relationship is with the man's own psyche, which writer/director Bergman does not hesitate to plunge deeply into.We see Isak's psyche through metaphoric and sometimes disturbing dream sequences, one of which takes place right at the beginning of the film. The dream involves Isak walking down an empty road, disillusioned and confused. The clocks do not have hands on them, and everything appears washed-out and unusually bright. We see a horse-drawn carriage collide into a pole, releasing one of its wooden wheels. The horse scurry off frightened when a casket falls off the carriage, opening slightly, revealing its contents to be those of Isak's. The \"body\" attempts to pull him in right before Isak can snap back into reality. That scene plays like a short film in itself and is surreal and poignant, offering more than words could ever.Wild Strawberries is a treat everyone should indulge in. It provided me with one of the most thought-provoking characters I've ever seen - someone who can connect and get on the good side of those he just meets, but truly takes advantage of and detaches himself from those close to him - and gave me one of the rawest and interesting dramas I have yet to see.Starring: Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, Bibi Andersson, Ingrid Thulin, and Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand.

How we all long to remove the hands from the clock, but death will always reach for us; every day its fingers come closer, and it magnifies our past, our memories, our history.This is Bergman's most Surrealist film (there are shades of Bu\u00f1uel, Deren and even Cocteau), and one of his most compassionate and warm -- if anyone tells you that Bergman is simply the harbinger of misery and existential dread, this is the film to prove them wrong. That's not to say that the film doesn't bear a wistful sadness at its core, as all Bergman films do, but his tenderness can be overlooked.A beautiful film, and a great Bergman starting point for those who don't feel ready to jump headfirst into the suffocating intensity of something like 'Cries and Whispers'.",

The wonderfully surreal dreams and nightmares and flashbacks do a terrific job of outlining Isak's character and his empty life, but I felt that the story in the present didn't accurately reflect what the stories of the past implied. The elder Isak wasn't cold, wasn't harsh, and didn't deserve the loneliness which had crept over him. And, as such, I felt like his character didn't really grow over the course of the narrative, as I didn't think he was that distant to begin with. There's some redemption to be found with his son, of course, but why was that redemption required? I just thought Isak's character didn't fit within the context of the flashbacks.I suppose I'll probably like it better once I understand Bergman more and watch it again, but for now, I'll just have to be disappointed.",

The style, however, is talky, the cast do their job but the whole experience lacks a little of the intensity of Bergman's later work.

I found it recommended as \"soothing\" somewhere, and being aware of how much of an important director Bergman is considered, I thought why not give it a try.It wasn't really soothing, but it wasn't difficult to watch either. The Swedish are weird for the less Nordic Europeans, that showed here too. Why are they so quiet, then so dramatic all of a sudden? And in this movie why were they marring cousins? Someone said once it is their climate...I also wondered why it seemed that upper class could meditate of their lives and in the same time waste them, suffer and sigh (not only in this movie, but this one brought it back), while the financially undetermined characters are supposed to always be occupied with the simpler yet equally cruel struggles of everyday life? So, I would contest the validity of the life cameo here because of the main character being so particular. Why take an individual so atypical and expand on life philosophy through him? And the greatest objection is that this movie seems purposeless, a luxury that in our era is very rarely permitted. Maybe judging it by the year it was made this would be less disturbing, but now...The old man has his dreams, his childhood flashbacks, the vague thoughts to change some things, yet it is considered somehow enough that he achieved some kind of human connection with his daughter in law, an encounter with some youngsters and half of a discussion with his son.Well, it is not. People who do not bend all their lives for those close to them, leave traumas and marks that may not heal even after generations have come and gone. It is not enough to have a few dreams and half of a conversation, then forgive oneself and talk about epiphany. The film does not take a stand, therefore the likes of Isak could watch it and think that having thoughts is enough to change the world for the better, even the wrongs they have done.And this is not moralistic talk. It is hard for humans to tell each other the truth, even harder to accept it. A movie, a book, a play can build a bridge over this gap. If a piece of such art tackles such a delicate subject it shouldn't let it in the air.The movie is a cowardly approach of regret.Interesting little thing: the way he was mixing with the past characters, him as an old man, the others young, telling him they remained young.",

After living a life marked by coldness, an aging professor is forced to confront the emptiness of his existence during a journey across Sweden to receive his honorary degree, filled with flashbacks and dream sequences. The market throughout the dead centre years of the 20th century offered the world a considerably large collection of epic-style films orientating around the subjects of introspection, recollection of past lives and regret from all corners of the atlas. As you'd expect it just so happened to become the case that Bergman's finest hour is the gold standard of such an exploit: its sombre tone from the word go mixed with the melodic Swedish-language screenplay make for a truly moving, thought provoking and memorable feature film which explores the aforementioned facets of seasoned-to-misery ageing protagonist Dr Isak Borg (Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m). Laced with flashbacks that remain deeper, more beautiful and more poetic throughout than those of its rivals, Bergman guides Smultronst\u00e4llet with his steady and knowledgeable hand through a Viennese waltz of charming and calming rhetoric and retrospect of dear thought and organisation. When writing about Smultronst\u00e4llet, one has to mention the famous dream sequence, where Borg travels through an empty city: with broken clocks, paper thin faces and a chilling atmosphere that really establishes Smultronst\u00e4llet as not solely a homely film of no distress. The flashbacks provide an insight into the exquisitely crafted life of the many-faced protagonist, funnel towards a cumulative emotional impact of this simple, powerful story and its probing revelation of human character, desire, and chagrin. My grandmother, an immigrant from Sweden, translated a version of Smultronst\u00e4llet and it has remained her personal jewel throughout the years for a fraction of the reasons I've mentioned. On top of its emotional amicability and the journey it shows us into the reminiscent mind of a fascinating character, it shows us moreover an equally brilliant journey through Southern Sweden in its aesthetic glory, with the black and white lens never subtracting from it, until we reach Borg's 'smultronst\u00e4llet', literally translated as wild strawberry patch or 'a place of sentimental meaning'. Never has a lovelier journey been created and realised, with such brutal honesty, a revelation of a life lived of mixed emotions and receptions, and incomparable dream sequences.",

Dr. Isak Borg (Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m) is a bitter old man who lost the twinkle in his eye and love of people during 78 years of a hard, but successful life. A domineering stern mother and an unhappy marriage have left him without apparent emotional attachments. A strange dream shakes him out of his routine and he makes a sudden decision to drive to the town (Luund) where he is to receive a high honor. His daughter-in-law, Marianne (Ingrid Thulin), joins him on the journey, but he is totally uninterested in hearing about her problems. On the way to Luund, he decides to stop at an old house where he spent his youth with his 9 siblings. A patch of wild strawberries takes him on a journey in time to his youth when he was madly in love with his cousin Sara (Bibi Andersson). All of a sudden the memories awaken in him the pain of losing Sara and the failed relationship with his wife. The latter memory finds echo in the relationship of a couple that they pick up on the road, but he also meets an old patient Henrik (Max Van Sydow) who thanks Isak for some unspecified kindness in the past. The road crew becomes decidedly interesting when they pick up hitchhikers, a lovely and lively young girl named Sara (Bibi Andersson again) and her two boyfriends. Little by little and in often imperceptible ways we see Dr. Borg soften and become more human. By the journey's end, Isak has come a full circle. He has reconciled with his own past and achieved a kind of peace few are lucky enough to acquire.Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m is fabulous as the old man and others are cast perfectly as well; many of whom are usual participants in Ingmar Bergman's adventures. Bibi Andersson looks radiant and it is easy to fall in love with her. Ingrid Thulin's character is also changed by the journey and she goes from being a cold and estranged wife to one who is beginning to understand and like her father-in-law. People taking a \"journey\" or road trip is a popular theme in films, and this is one of the most effective ones. It sometimes resembles \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" in its ability to find magic and meaning in the woods. Except for a brief Dali-Hitchcock inspired scene in the beginning, there is nary a false note. It is vintage Bergman.",

As someone who mostly watched hollywood movies that don't really care for philosophy I was very pleasantly surprised. Great acting from the main character, Marianne and her husband.I was also very surprised about the role of women in this movie. This was made in the 50s, and you women driving, smoking, hitting their husbands and overall having a very strong presence in the movie. The \"typical\" feminine clich\u00e9s are really not present here which is brilliant. Scandinavia has always been at the forefront of women's rights and this movie certainly shows that. As someone from southern europe, when I lived in Sweden for a few months one of the things I noticed is how traditional gender roles really don't exist there and it's brilliant.

But it is hardly a worthy reason not to watch a movie.\"Smultronst\u00e4llet\" was directed by Ingmar Bergman and the title can be translated in many ways such as \"cuddle the faith lightly\" which gives out a philosophical undertone behind the movie but doesn't make a good title whatsoever; another version is \"crumbling place\" which is probably the closest to the main idea but worldwide this gem of Bergman's is known as \"Wild strawberries\" or \"The wild strawberry patch\".

            "review_title": "The road trip of life",
            "content": "Wild Strawberries is at once a road trip film, and a trip down memory lane. 78 year old Isak journeys through idyllic forestry on the way to a ceremony that celebrates his life achievements as a doctor. He travels with his daughter-in-law, picks up a young trio hitching their way to Italy, and briefly, an arguing couple who they were involved in a car accident with. He recalls past memories of his younger days, and has bad dreams. It plays out less like narrative fiction than a hodge-podge diary entry, things occurring spontaneously. This means no one mood is ever built upon in layers, rather it ebbs and flows almost without structure. There are themes of death hanging over the film, unanswered questions regarding God and science, bickering and co-operation between men and women, the contrast of expression between young and old, and an appreciation for the beauty of life and the honour of career based achievements, contrasted with incidents recalling great sadness, and a failure in personal relationships - from lost loves, cheating partners, and forgotten family. Although Isak appears quite endearing and the film takes a sympathetic viewpoint, he is nonetheless faulted for his past cold aloofness which caused the women to cheat, yet the women and the partners they took up with are also faulted for their lack of principal. And when Isak attempts a greater warmth towards his maid in the final scene, she rebuffs him, long set in her own manner. In this fashion Bergman veers away from giving clich\u00e9 or easy answers, and manages to capture the complexities of human relationships.Aside from hints that Isak's remaining days are limited, there is not a great deal of tension in the film, meaning it is more poem than a blockbuster. Yet it manages to maintain interest due to the emotional sway, and all encompassing themes - which are ever present, yet never preached. It is a quest for meaning, where the filmmakers wish not to give the answer, but capture the journey - for which a road trip proves a suitable metaphoric vehicle. The freewheeling nature of it helps prevent the weighty themes from becoming too morbid, and feels just as though they would on any road trip spent staring out the window. Vivid and distant at the same time.",

He is a creator of complex characters. In his most acclaimed film Wild Strawberries, on the surface of narration you can't find anything special here. But you can easily find out a 'meaning' is there. Hope you can understand that I'm not using the word 'meaning' in a typical term.Bergman is capable to make a feel of his 'meaning' in his film from beginning to end. In this film you can find two existential element parallel in whole narrative is loneliness and the memories from the past. Here unlike other existential movies the pathos runs into the generations.Wild Strawberries in like an old poem. No wonder that Bergman tells us a story about old people or about those are growing to be old. Some youth are also in this plot but they creates a contrast and the darkness around the main character. It is very difficult to make a simple decision about Bergman and this is truth about all great filmmakers... isn't it?",

            "review_title": "Smultronst\u00e4llet",
            "content": "\"Wild Strawberry\" is a story about life and redemption directed by the Swedish director Bergman in 1957. Starting from Isaac, the hero of this film, he is going back to accept the honorary degree as a starting point, through the dream of the hero in the journey, His conversations with his daughter-in-law, mother, and young people hitchhiking on the road re-engraved the big events in his life and showed his transformation. There is no lack of ingenuity in this film, and I am willing to take Isaac 's first dream in this film, as well as the most \"movie-like\" segment of my personal movie viewing experience so far, as the analysis object of this assignment.It should be particularly pointed out that in addition to the narration of the protagonist who promptly guides the audience to the dream, this paragraph discards all human voices, that is, it discards the artificial prompting interference from the outside world.The informative narration tells the audience that our protagonist lost his way on the empty street during the morning walk. At this time he heard the sound of a bell ringing, perhaps this is to remind the audience that the picture has a close-up of the protagonist in the foreground and a street with a clock in the background, and the protagonist is going in the direction of the clock.He turned his back to us and walked vertically into the picture. A strange clock stood on the right side of the figure: it was like a street lamp standing upright, with icons of two big eyes hanging under the clock. We can only hear the footsteps of the characters. The protagonist must have been surprised by this. He walked to the strange clock and found that it had no hands. At this time his heartbeat sounded, instead of his stopped footsteps. So he opened his pocket watch, but he was surprised to find that the pocket watch also had no pointer. At this time his heartbeat continued. After taking off his hat and stroking his brain in confusion, he walked into the shadow of the sun and stood on the street like a street lamp, and leaned against the wall (this is the subconscious behavior of people when they encounter confusion- -Looking for dependents), looked closely at this strange clock without hands, the camera zoomed in on the protagonist, and we saw him turn his head.At this time, he turned and continued to walk straight towards the original direction. Due to the change of the camera, the position of the character changed from a deep lens to a horizontal lens. After walking slowly for a while, he stopped, hesitated for a while, turned around and walked back quickly, past the strange clock and returned to his original position. At this time, the panorama fade-out was quickly replaced by the close-up of the characters, except for the characters in the picture, the background was all black. We saw him turn his head, and then we saw another street with different buildings. He looked back at the street with weird clocks, and found the back of a man in his costume standing near the clock. He walked towards the back of the man. The editing here appears to be incoherent. The connection between the character's turning head and the next scene shows that the character is not standing in the same position. The latter is shorter than the man's back compared to the former.He walked into the man and touched the man's left shoulder with his right hand. Perhaps under the joint force of the protagonist's hand and the back man, the man turned around. Note that the close-up of the lens at this time is facing the protagonist, and what we see is his obviously frightened expression, which makes the audience consider the reason why the protagonist was shocked. The next second, the audience saw a man whose facial features wrinkled into dough and concentrated on his face. Here shows the director's brilliance, not only brought suspense to the audience, but also quickly answered the suspense for the audience. Next is the same technique, we see the protagonist's eyes down, his head down, and then we heard a sound, and saw the man fall to the ground. The bell rang again, and the fallen man's body turned into a dark liquid (which can only be seen as black in the black-and-white film). The protagonist looked up, looking for the source of the bell. He walked forward again, toward the direction he had originally planned to go back to because of fear. With the bells, we saw the protagonist once again reached an intersection. He saw two horse-drawn carriages passing by on the corner of the street.Among the bells and horseshoes, the carriage walked in the opposite direction to the protagonist. The protagonist's eyes followed the carriage. When the carriage passed the street lamp, one side of the wheel was caught by the street lamp and could not move forward. The unmanned horse-drawn carriage did not reverse its direction to avoid the street lights, but kept hitting the street lights until the wheels close to the street lights fell off. The wheel rolled to the protagonist's side, and the protagonist was shocked. The carriage without one side of the wheel lost its balance and was difficult to pull-by squeaking sound. The lens rotates between the protagonist and the carriage details, showing that the protagonist begins to examine the carriage carefully. He saw the angel on the carriage decoration, and the coffin on the carriage. In the creaking sound, the coffin fell off, and the two horse-drawn carriages moved forward quickly-since their function of introducing the coffin had been achieved, it was time to let them exit.Only the protagonist and the coffin are left in the picture. During the fall from the carriage, the lid of the coffin shook open, revealing the human hand inside. The protagonist walked towards the coffin, the hand inside stiffened to stretch, the protagonist's body shook, we saw the hand in the coffin holding the hand to the protagonist holding the coffin ... he saw that the people in the coffin looked like themselves It's exactly the same! (Background sounds more rapid) He wants to break free, he wants to escape, the camera rotates in close-ups of his face in him and the coffin, the closer the camera gets, the closer it gets ... At this time, he wakes up, confused Eyes are facing the camera. Get up immediately and can't wait to go back home.Such a strange dream was arranged by the director at the beginning of the whole story. It is undoubtedly the revelation of the life as the protagonist of the confession. The clock without pointers, the man who touches away, the man in the coffin with the same face as him, the background is constantly The death knell that sounded all indicated that he was scared of his absence. It was this kind of fear that prompted him to recall on the way back to his hometown and produce dreams, and the director also introduced the episode through these clips to show the protagonist's open hearted process by a cold and selfish man.",

There's really very little here. An old man has a few wistful memories. Uh huh...and...? The main problem is that the old man is simply not worthy of interest. He has had a distinguished career as a doctor and is on the way to pick up an honorary degree. Are we supposed to sympathise with such a successful life? And, quite amazingly, his mother is still alive, a sprightly woman in her nineties. Life and death doesn't really come into context until both your parents have died (so I found), so the mere existence of this old woman undermines much of the poignancy the old man is supposed to be feeling. This women is even older - let's hear about her instead.Then we have the white-flannelled folk in the dacha about whom we learn more than we want to know but not enough to make them interesting. None of it was adding meaning or emotion or even an introspective feeling about life and death.There isn't even any sense that the old man is going to die any time soon - he looks good for another ten years or so. Nor does he come to any startling Scrooge-like conclusions of his own past. He is supposed to be crabby and antisocial but he doesn't appear that way at all - another thing that undermines the film's own intentions.And Bergman is guilty of using too-obvious metaphors again: the three young hitchhikers are so clearly intended to represent youthful devil-may-care that they are impossibly idealised and behave like no human beings you will ever come across in your lifetime - no more than cartoons.At best, it's a decent little chamber piece, but it's intellectually impoverished and misses it's own targets by a mile. I can't see anything great about it. Sorry Ingmar.",

The night before he left, he had a dream that he was being held fast by another issac in the coffin. Isaac woke up anxious, he decided to drive to Stockholm, by the way to visit the old house, to find the answer to the ups and downs of the heart. Fellow daughter-in-law marian and son due to whether to have a child dispute, Isaac sought mediation, Isaac refused to intervene on the grounds of children. Isaac learned from his daughter-in-law that his son had always hated the dysfunctional family in which he grew up and hated being a parent. As the car passed the childhood holiday cottage and revisited the place, Isaac began to reminisce. Issac was busy with his studies and future when he was young, so he ignored his beloved fiancee Sarah. The playboy cousin took the opportunity to capture Sarah's heart. When leaving the hut, he met a hitchhiker who looked like Sarah's girl and two young men. Seeing them young and lively, Isaac secretly regretted betraying his youth.Isaac practiced medicine outside the charity, conduct widely praised; At home, I was wallowing in a vision of Sarah. His wife, in order to avenge her husband's ruthlessness and ruthlessness, sought for an affair, and the couple turned against each other. After visiting Isaac's mother, marian discovers that they share the same personality in the family: both rational and cold. At last they attended Isaac's investitures in Stockholm, and despite the pomp and circumstance of the ceremony, Isaac was still steeped in memories and deep introspection. That night, Isaac finally decided to persuade his son, but found that his son for love, has made concessions to marian. At the end of the film, Isaac falls asleep again. In his dream he saw his parents snuggling up to each other by a beautiful lake. Isaac's eyes relaxed in his sleep and he smiled with relief. After much doubt, regret and remorse, Isaac finally found peace of mind.\nAbout the subject:Bergman is one of the few directors to use the camera to explore the guilt of religious people. \"Wild strawberries\" is a big departure from his usual cinematic style, such as the indoor triad, where bergman pretends to raise the question of death and god without intending to discuss it further. Bergman was suspicious of god, so he asked questions, was in awe of god, and pretended to answer them. The result was a sigh of resignation. The film achieves the inner peace like religious redemption, but also loses the deep discussion and exploration of the theme. Fans of bergman's heckling god style may not be happy with the film.About the soundtrack:The film's few score was given to Bach's the equal law. Despite bergman's religious skepticism, his love of Bach music was natural. The intellectual precision and quiet harmony of Bach's works, both deeply religious and strangely obsessive, may have been something bergman yearned for all his life as he endlessly questioned the existence of god in his films. When Isaac dreamed that Sarah would blame him for his indifference and turn to his cousin's arms, Isaac's heart was in his throat outside the window. At this moment, Sara played the \"equal law\", which relieved the pain in Isaac's heart. The calm, orderly notes of \"the average law\" are the best sedative for the soul at any time.About dreams and metaphors:The first dream triggers the motivation to pick up the old things. Before this, Isaac's inner life was overshadowed by a simple, regular life and unconscious avoidance. A clock with no hands appears in Isaac's dreams and among the old objects his mother keeps. The dial has no hands, indicating that life has come to an end. Old people in their twilight years hope to have their doubts answered and their insecurities quieted before the end of their lives. The second disturbing dream occurred in class, when sark dreamed that he had been convicted of forgetting the first principle of a doctor: \"to ask for forgiveness.\" After gradually alienating the family, issac's medical achievements were denied, and then completely denied issac's former thought of noble and meaningful life. The third dream is almost entirely religious, filled with the atmosphere of redemptive peace. The wild strawberry, a symbol of rebirth, reopens in a dream with the hero's warm memories.Conclusion:\nFor 97 minutes, bergman constructed a complex narrative structure interspersed with dreams. As for the film should choose to avoid the eternal (or temporary?)? Peace and joy; To open the wound, to expose the wound of the soul to the heart for healing, is really a matter of opinion.",

            "content": "Wild Strawberries should be considered essential viewing for anyone, who wants to get in touch with Ingmar Bergman's great directorial career. It's one of those movies, along with The Seventh Seal, that discuss the theme of a meaningful journey, covered with existential dilemmas and spiritual moralities. Dr. Isaak Borg, an old and very acclaimed professor, is about to travel from Stockholm to Lund in order to receive an honorary degree. Normally he would've taken the plane, but due to a eerie dream that haunted him the previous night he starts to reminisce about his whole life, and finally decides to ride there by car, just to have some time for himself and those piercing thoughts of various matters. Yet, along with him comes his daughter-in-law Marianne. In a series of honest exchange of views Isaak realizes how meaningless and full of void his life has been up to this point. He shut out all of the relationship that he had and concentrated only on his selfish life made up of hard work and materialistic needs. Even though he achieved respect in the scientific world, in the humanity's entity he has been dead for a long time now. Emotionless and cold- as-ice, he wasn't able to take care of any person that longed for his attention.Somewhere along the road they stop at the house where Isaak grew up. His hazy memory shows him a few scenes from his early life, and how really bitter and depressing it has been. Without love and warmth, even from the girl he wanted to marry, he blocked his deepest emotions and became as ruthless as the people he was surrounded by. And it all passes down in the family, as it seems that his son is as heartless and dismal as his father. Thoughts of death occur on a daily basis, as if the pain of being alive was too hard to bear. It's really paradoxical, that the only people that ever thought of him as a nice and friendly man were those, who didn't know him one bit: the family at the gas station, and the three young people he took along on the ride.Bergman placed them fantastically in the story to present a sharp contrast between the cheerful young fellows and a sorrowful, nearly dead, old man contemplating his empty life. There is also a notion of the existence of God that those three characters bring onto the screen.It's as if Bergman wanted to evaluate Borg's fatalism with contradicting it with the possibilities of an afterlife. His body is still functioning, but in the spiritual meaning he is long gone.On the side of cinematography, this divine problem is also brilliantly shown by the nightmare that haunted Borg that night. He stands on a street, in a place devoid of time, where people melt and die. Then comes the metaphorical black stagecoach carrying a coffin with Borg inside. Is he still alive, or is he dead? An image that would scary anyone, I suppose.In the end apart from deep empathy I somehow felt happy, as the final scenes provide some kind of a reprieve for Borg. Even though he lead a life of emptiness and was never kind to anyone, and valued death over life itself, at the end of the day he finally caught a glimpse of what real remorse may feel like.",

The main actor is wonderful, but I felt like this film should've been longer and detail was lacking. We never see the main actor with his wife or showing his hard exterior in much of any scene. I just didn't feel for him like I should've. Also his emphasis on human cruelty is always over the top n seems like he likes to dwell in it a lil too much. I get it humans can be cruel but life is more cruel IMO. Still any cinephile should check this one out. I really liked the idea behind this film on reflecting back on ur life n feel like old age is like this well done in this aspect n good message about life's meaning.

            "content": "(a \"you know so much, but you don't know anything\" film review by Timothy J. Verret)\n\nI remember seeing WILD STRAWBERRIES the first time when I was maybe in my late 20s or early 30s. I had already grown accustomed to the marvelous majesty of Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, but I'm afraid this film at that time was a little lost on me. Cut to me now, age 54, and I can honestly tell you that there is NOTHING lost on me about this film. I TOTALLY \"get it\" now and what I \"get\" is encapsulated in the line Sara delivers to the main character, Isak Borg, wherein she is holding up a mirror to Isak and says, \"you know so much, but you don't know anything.\" Yes, indeed, do I EVER \"get\" that!\n\nIsak Borg is a doctor of much knowledge but also much disappointment and much loneliness. The film begins with Isak taking a trip to Stockholm to receive a medal of honor for this much knowledge. What he doesn't receive is much peace on the way to Stockholm by car, for he is treated to flashbacks and \"flashforwards\" that make him question who he really is minus this much knowledge. What he really is, as mentioned, is much disappointment and much loneliness. Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, a most definite favorite actor of Bergman ever since he saw Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m's THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE, plays Isak Borg, and this performance is wonderfully nuanced and wonderfully \"naked.\" Borg flashbacks to the girl, Sara, he wished he had married. He flashbacks that he has not been kind at all to his son, Evald, or Evald's wife, Marriane, who accompanies Isak on his trip to Stockholm. These flashbacks collide with \"flashforwards.\" One such as these was when Isak and Marianne picked up a husband-and-wife hitchhiker whose marriage was infused with humiliation and mean words, all taking place in the back seat of their car. It is Marianne who eventually stops the car to let these troubled souls out, but we know Isak wants them out, too, because they remind him of his humiliating and mean words spoken to his wife, Karin, who has passed away. There are also three young people they give a ride to, and they also are \"flashforwards\" but also flashbacks, because they remind Isak of his lost youth.\n\nWILD STRAWBERRIES has two (BOTH) dream sequences that are the sheer genius of Ingmar Bergman. Isak has a dream at the beginning of the film where he is walking down a deserted street with a blazing yellow sun (you can feel the heat, although the film is in black-and-white). He spots a clock tower that has no hands and an eventual meet-up with someone who has a smudged face and when touched crumbles and bleeds (blood? water? Jesus? (\"one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water\"-John 19:34). A horse-drawn carriage (never one of my favorite things) comes around the corner carrying a coffin that eventually falls to the ground and then a hand with the face of Isak protrudes out, attempting to pull him into the coffin. The other dream sequence midway through the film is Isak being tested for all his much knowledge, only to realize that this much knowledge has led him to \"you know so much, but you don't know anything.\" If there is anything Isak comes to realize, it is that his life up until now has been resentments, coldness, and, yes, loneliness. In fact, it is the medical record from this testing that reveals Isak's diagnosis. And what is that diagnosis? Yep, you guessed it\u2026.loneliness! In fact, almost every character in the many Ingmar Bergman films I have seen have this same diagnosis of loneliness. I know for a fact it's my diagnosis.\n\n\"You know so much, but you don't know anything.\" What does this really mean for all of us? It means, like Isak, we can know so much but not know anything. It means we can think we know so much but actually not know anything. This is such a struggle for the intellectual ones like Bergman and like myself. We have all this knowledge. We have our intellect, we have our words, we have our careers, and we even have our family and friends. But do we know anything about any of these things? Of course not! We don't really know what any of these things will mean in the end. We won't really know until the end if any of these things have meant anything. I have often been quoted as saying (or thinking): \"I know God and yet I am still coming to know God. But, outside of knowing God, I don't know anything.\" I sure do try to know anything about anything, but I only know God and yet I am still coming to know God. The irony here is that there can be much freedom in admitting I don't know anything. I think I am going to lose something by admitting I don't know anything (can you relate?) but, in reality, I know EVERYTHING because I know FREEDOM! When I detach from anything, I have EVERYTHING which is I have FREEDOM!\n\nWriting this film review of WILD STRAWBERRIES made me think of a comment I received once from someone who was reading one of my Ingmar Bergman film reviews. The one commenting said, and I'm paraphrasing, \"Your film reviews are too much of a love fest of Ingmar Bergman.\" I think this one commenting meant that as an insult, but I took it as a HUGE compliment! My film reviews of Ingmar Bergman's films ARE a love fest because I LOVE INGMAR BERGMAN'S FILMS! Should I be hesitant to \"drip\" this love fest all over these reviews I write about Ingmar Bergman's films? I want them to \"drip\" a love fest and, in fact, I want them to downright \"bleed.\" My blog website here has the mission statement of \"I'm gonna to need to bleed for God!\" I still hold steadfast to that statement, but I also can have BOTH by \"I'm gonna need to bleed for Ingmar Bergman!\" Can't I?\n\nTo close this film review out is the closing image of Isak in WILD STRAWBERRIES. Isak has received his medal of much knowledge and after such a long day of flashbacks and \"flashforwards\" of much disappointment and much loneliness, he is seen lying in his bed, quickly falling asleep, and he has a face of TOTAL peace. I think Isak has come to realize, like me, he has detached from anything, and he, like me, has EVERYTHING which is he, like me, NOW has FREEDOM!",

            "content": "A moving tribute to the aging among us.\n\nIngmar Bergman directed Wild Strawberries (1957) with a tender affection for the plight of the elderly. He allows for reminiscing on the past with old memories brought about by Bergman's surreal dream sequences. I marvel at Bergman's creative visual aesthetic. He constantly keeps you entertained and questioning what you are watching with each new scene.\n\nBergman displays his masterful craftsmanship as a director with clever dream sequences brought to life by clever editing and wondrous cinematography. The edit to the car wreck is so sudden it appears before the audience as the actual crash happens before the characters. The fades to the childhood house of old is so beautiful as Bergman depicts pastoral scenes of serenity of happiness next to uncertainty and adolescence. I adored the hard cuts to Isak's face as he discovers his son hates him, his wife cheated on him, and his first love left him. Bergman holds no punches and goes for the most emotionally poignant moments in Wild Strawberries.\n\nThe gorgeous Swedish setting is matched by the beauty of how Bergman uses the camera lens. From slowly panning down a building hallway or following Isak down a deserted street, Bergman finds the most intriguing perspective for each shot. I particularly loved Isak watching his wife's infidelity behind a wooden pillar and the scene towards the end by the lake. They are picturesque in their quiet serenity, but convey a much deeper emotion alongside their striking visual nature.\n\nFurthermore, Ingmar Bergman proves his lovely pen work as Wild Strawberries' writer. His contemplation on happiness, love, marriage, death and many more themes made Wild Strawberries his most profound cinematic experience yet. Bergman brings a thoughtfulness and truthfulness to his words. His themes are universal as are the multiple perspectives of generations he wrote into Wild Strawberries. We see people of all ages experiencing life as Isak is remembering it.\n\nSpeaking of Isak Borg, his character is so movingly portrayed by legendary director Victor Sjostrom. His demonstration of age's wisdom and care is astonishing. Sjostrom brings a humanity and empathy to his role as Isak. You really come to care about this old man and his retrospective. Sjostrom's final role is admirable as it is he who made Bergman's Wild Strawberries shine with emotional depth during Isak's character study.\n\nI must mention the dual role of the adorable and lovely Bibi Andersson. She plays Isak's former flame Sara as well as the lively hitchhiker Sara. She is so sweet and endearing and adds such youthful life and excitement to Wild Strawberries. She is a phenomenal actress displaying the deep regret of the past Sara's indiscretions to the young Sara's uncertainty in choosing a love. Her sweet goodbye to Isak is unforgettable as is her bright smile. Bibi Andersson could play it all!\n\nSimilarly, the stunning actress Ingrid Thulin plays Marianne Borg. Her convincing depiction of a miserable wife hoping for a child and happiness is quite touching. I found myself liking Thulin more and more as Wild Strawberries continued. Her speeches to Isak about her husband not liking him and not desiring a child are captivating to say the least. Thulin was a remarkable actress!\n\nLastly, there are to neat cameo roles that I have to touch upon as Max von Sydow plays an engaging gas attendant for a scene. Sydow shows his acting prowess as you remember him even though he's just a cameo in a short scene, but he manages to convey his character's respect and love to Isak. You even learn how great a doctor Isak is in this scene. It's a nice uplifting sequence, if brief. On the other hand, Gunnar Bjornstrand plays Isak's horrid son Evald Borg. His stern rejection of parenthood is shocking as is his hesitation towards his father and his wife. He gives a great supporting role in Wild Strawberries.\n\nIn all, Wild Strawberries is the most moving film I have seen in a long time. It captures the fears of aging and dying, while showing sincere empathy for a life well lived. Watch Wild Strawberries!",

However the strange kids he meets did nothing for me, and the bickering couple were even worse. I realize that the intent was to use people in the present to get him reflecting on his past, but I was more interested in just watching his flashbacks. The whole film was paced slowly and had many quiet contemplative moments, just as you might expect from Ingmar Bergman. That style of film has never clicked with me unless I\u2019m very deeply connected with the characters. Since Dr. Borg starts the film as a stoic man, it was tough for me to find that deep connection. I wasn\u2019t completely put off by Wild Strawberries, and I could see what it was trying to do.

I don't know that it offered many more insights or facts beyond what I already knew - and it may have impacted on my appreciation of the film this time (too distracting).  That said, Wild Strawberries is still undoubtedly a masterpiece from film titan Ingmar Bergman.  His regular troupe of actors is here: Ingrid Thulin, Bibi Andersson, Max von Sydow, Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand, Naima Wifstrand - but the lead role goes to Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, then 79-years-old and a fabled film director and star actor in his own right (known most famously for The Phantom Carriage, 1921, He Who Gets Slapped, 1924, and The Wind, 1928).  Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m plays Isak Borg (note the initials), a retired professor of medicine who will travel from Stockholm to Lund over the course of the film (a 14 hour car journey) in order to receive an honorary degree.  The journey becomes a psychic exploration of Borg's past and principally his relationships with women; it seems that his has been a lonely existence, possibly due to his own cold selfish nature, which may in turn be a result of his relations with his parents (an autobiographical note from Bergman himself).  This subtext is told primarily through dream sequences that offer some glimpses of reality as it may have been and some nightmarish eruptions of anxiety filled with symbolism (clocks with no hands) and a foreboding sense of imminent death.  We see fond reveries of his first crush, Sara (Bibi Andersson), in the wild strawberry patch - and then we later see her in a frightening scene where she holds a mirror up to Borg to show him his flaws (surely not something that really happened).  Sara is also mirrored by her modern day doppelganger, a modern young Sara who Borg and his daughter-in-law Marianne (Ingrid Thulin) pick up hitchhiking with two male travelling companions on their way to Italy.  While Marianne gives Borg a piece of her mind (informing him how his own son hates him for the way he has been treated), the new young Sara gives Borg a chance to amend his ways, soften his personality, and reflect on his own behaviour. Marianne and her estranged husband (Borg's son; Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand) have fought over whether to have children (he thinks that it is cruel to bring anyone into this terrible world - an existential truism for Bergman, perhaps) but by the end of the film, they will reconcile and Borg's own anxieties will have calmed.  Yet overall, the film seems ambivalent toward life and relationships - Bergman sees them as affording both great torment and the opportunity for beautiful communion.  Each generation passes along its successes and failures to the next one - yet there is still hope that one can escape this determinism, if perhaps only on our deathbeds!  A rich and provocative film that would reward closer study.",

The commentary superimposed more on the film than was there in the form of homages, etc. An old man recalls a life that seems full outwardly but maybe not in reality. Sort of an introspective hoity-toity road movie, actually, that manages to avoid pretension. The protagonist loses his true love fianc\u00e9 to the bad-boy lothario cousin. Bitter & never sweetened throughout a long life. Nice Swedish blondes throughout but not as profound as the serious film'ists would have you believe. The euro school - perhaps advanced for its time.

It may sound too sedate to hold one's interest, but it does.  Through dream sequences filled with symbolism and dialog with people he meets along the way, we get a picture painted of his life, its key moments, and how he evolved over time.  We see the common thread - his serious, intelligent, considerate, yet cool and judgmental personality - and how that made him a very successful doctor, but created difficulties in his personal life.  We see how he lost the real love of his life when she was picking wild strawberries and his own more passionate brother pursued her, and how his subsequent marriage to another was plagued with strife and his wife's infidelity.   We see how this carried down to his son, his unhappy childhood, his depression, and the difficulty he has in his own marriage.  We also see the perils of old age, seeing death coming, being sentimental, and fearing becoming obsolete.  We see that despite his brilliant career and the very prestigious award he's just been given, the most meaningful, happy moment in his life was simply fishing on a peaceful day with his father, a sentiment which has a 'Rosebud' feel to it.\n\nThe film is not heavy or hard to watch and just enjoy Bergman's storytelling, but at the same time it does have a weightiness to it - in recalling the soul-crushing moments of sadness in life, in his sentimental reflections of his childhood, in his weighing in on two younger men's debate about God's existence (\"I see His traces wherever flowers bloom\"), and as he thinks about his mortality.   Some comic relief is provided in his relationship with housekeeper, who brings a smile when she leaves her door ajar as she goes to bed in case he \"wants anything\", after having bickered with him for the entire movie (and presumably decades of their lives).    \n\nI don't see the film as being optimistic or pessimistic, or as much 'warmer' than his other work, though other viewers certainly seem to and there are moments of charm, such as when the young woman of the three he gives a ride to talks to him, asks him for advice, and sweetly says she loves him as they part.  Bibi Andersson played both this role and the role of the girl in the strawberry patch that he lost, which has a certain symmetry and renewal to it.  However, I think the movie is realistic and balanced, with just as much bittersweetness as sweetness - even the married couple they nearly get into a car accident with make endless snide comments about one another - and its genius is in showing us truths about life that are common to us all.   \n\nWhile the movie doesn't preach or overtly push a message, you realize just how hard it is to lead a virtuous, positive life without regrets - and reflect on your own life, where you place priorities, how you treat people, whether you appreciate the small moments, or recognize the pivotal ones - all the things that you will probably remember at the end.  Great art does this, spur reflection, and that's the case with 'Wild Strawberries'.   Don't believe all the hype, but at the same time, don't be intimidated either - this would be a good one to see.",

A sentimental story of an elderly man reaching the end of his life while looking back on it, Wild Strawberries is a film more traditional than Bergman's known for, sweet, funny, and emotionally affecting in a way that most of his work intentionally avoids.\n\nHis signature themes are at play here (existentialism, an awareness of death, religion), but this specific story allows him to move into territory he had not explored previously. Nightmarish dream sequences inform the life of Isak Borg, warning him of his impending death and forcing him into bouts of nostalgia. His story addresses ideas that deal with how life can turn kind people into cruel cynics, how single events completely change a person's trajectory, the guilt associated with devoting your life to a single path and the fear that you've wasted it all in the process, how life's greater mysteries remain even after a lifetime of living, and how we gloss over bad memories in order to coddle ourselves as we move forward. These themes are heady, but coalesce into a genuinely moving portrait of an old man who's going through what all people must go through eventually, a quietly brilliant piece of heartfelt filmmaking from a director known for dealing more with the cerebral but capable of adeptly addressing all aspects of the human experience.",

It's genuinely touching, and I love that there's actually a happy ending for once. I was really invested in Isak, and I really loved Sara, both because of her innate charm and the fact that Bibi Andersson was playing her. I really liked the dynamic with the group, for some reason, and I was actually touched when Sara, Anders, and Viktor sang for Isak at the end. I felt so happy for Isak, and I was so glad he got to make peace with his lot in life.\n\nThere were less fantastical elements than usual in this film, which I also liked, since I've always preferred the Bergman movies that just have a touch of fantasy or mystery, not a whole plot based around disorientation. In this case, the 'fantasy' was the dreams Isak had, but none of them deeply confused me, really. I understood, for the most part, what was going on.\n\nBy the time the movie was over, I was surprisingly moved by it, and it left me completely satisfied, something I haven't gotten from every Bergman movie.",

It's an intellectual, less schmaltzy European version of 'It's a Wonderful Life'.  \n\nThe film is the odyssey of a rather cold, cerebral and elderly highly respected professor Isak Borg (Victor Sjostrom) as he goes on the road with his sensitive and prickly daughter in law to receive an out of town honor.  Along the way, they visit Borg's even older and even colder 90 something mother.\n\nDon't give up.  The film initially seems to meander aimlessly.  Numerous apparently unrelated events unfold, including a submersion into Borg's past memories, picking up a trio of young and naive hitchhikers, the rather prickly exchanges with the mother, an encounter with a bitter and unpleasant middle aged couple that have had a car crash, and various dark revelations by Marianne the daughter in law about her teetering marriage to Borg's difficult son, who has inherited his father's cold and isolating tendencies. \n\nBy the end, the film presents a unified whole of a man coming to terms with his life and taking down the high walls from others with which he has isolated himself.  He forgives himself for his choices and his treatment of others, and is able to not only reconcile but express love for his pregnant daughter in law, the sensual and expressive Marianne, played by iconic Swedish beauty Ingrid Thulin. Look also for Bergman's favorite screen performer Max Von Sydow in a cameo performance as a small town gas station owner who reminds Borg of the good he has done in his life.  He shows some range as he is convincing as a simple goodhearted working man, a contrast from his usual high minded, tortured intellectual characters.\n\nThe crisp and gorgeous black and white photography of Bergman's early collaborator Gunnar Fischer presents the story not in gritty documentary style, but in picturesque, highly contrasting stylized compositions.  This is appropriate to the memories and elegiac retrospective of Borg's life.  Rarely cited as a Bergman favorite due to it's rambling nature, quiet introspection and the subtlety of its revelations, it may be his best film.  It's certainly his gentlest.",

Bergman's choice to develop the narrative around an aged man obviously reflects the notion to what extent does an individuals life contain a sense of purpose; as when we reach such an age, we reflect over the regrets and decisions that we have contributed to the universe and wonder if our life was a failure or an achievement. Borg is man who has achieved such accomplishing ideals; he is regarded as an honorary scientist and is being rewarded a prestige honor for his contribution. However, despite such virtues, Borg is also a man surrounded by isolation and regrets. Through a self reflective journey and a number of typical, but always memorable dream sequences; Bergman ultimately question such ideals that humanity continually stride for and that they only end with a superfluous purpose.\r\n\r\nBorg introduces us into his life; he inhabits a world that revolves around a sense of isolation which has been contributed from his egotistical nature. After we learn Borg's nature, Bergman introduces his favorite motif: Dream sequences. Borg's first dream takes place within a mysterious street. The street consist of clock that has no handles, a 'man' with a seriously weird head with the accompany of a hearse. Each separate figure represents a form of deterioration: the clock has lost its ability to tell time, the man eventually losses his head and there is a dead body within the hearse that resembles Borg's figure. Through this dream, Bergman is suggesting that death is just around the corner for Borg. Similar to the other sequences, Bergman deploys dreams and memories as a self-reflective state to display Borg's past. Each separate sequence contains it's importance, whether it consist of moments of revelation or innocence, they are moments that Borg wishes he could correct.\r\n\r\nIf you are not a fan of Bergman's brilliant ability in conveying the subconscious, Don't be afraid! 'Wild Strawberries' is obviously one of Bergman's most accessible films, contributed greatly from Victor Sjostrom performance. With a film that focuses a substantial amount of it's plot around the actions of a single man, it's important for the audience that we share an emotional connection, to which Sjostrom excels brilliantly in conveying his characters isolation and the lost of his true love. Through a reflective state of his innocence, Borg reveals that his true love left him for another man. In one particular and truly poignant dream sequence, Borg's love holds a mirror to his face and proceeds in mocking and situating Borg to a subordinate position as she tells him \"I'm going to marry your brother.\" We see Borg on the verge of tears as he whimpers \"But it hurts so.\" Undeniably heartbreaking.\r\n\r\nAs I previously mentioned, 'Wild strawberries' functions as a self-reflective journey of an individual. Through typical Fashion, Bergman uses Borg's life as an examination of the human condition in relation to our obsession of pursuing ideals that will ultimately eventuate in reminiscing over the sacred moments that we have neglected. Bergman solidifies this through the final sequences. Borg receives his prestige honor through an empty ritual; his reward contains no purpose. However, through the ending many of characters seem to find a sense of resolution, consider Borg's and Sara's (Andersson) final conversation,  \"Good-bye, father Isak. Can't you see you're the one I love? Today, tomorrow and forever\" to which Borg replies  \"I'll keep that in mind,\" and then for the final time we enter Borg's dreams to find that his mother and father are fishing by the river. Surprisingly, Borg's dream contains a sense of happiness rather than a sense of gloom. Borg now contains peace and tranquility,  he can die in happiness.\r\n\r\nEssential Bergman.",

With him his judgmental daughter-in-law and young hitchhikers caught in a love triangle. While 90% of the film was in the car ride only 50% of that was Isak actively in the car. We had many flashbacks and strange dreams which brought out David Lynches \"Eraserhead\" type of feeling out. The directing was almost perfect except I believe the camera work for the car crash scene was a tad off, making it confusing. It's still a good Ingmar Bergman film that I enjoyed.

His body is still functioning, but in the spiritual meaning he is long gone. Victor Sj\u00c3\u00b6str\u00c3\u00b6m is undeniably convincing, as the intelligent professor, who shut out all of the relationship that he had and concentrated only on his selfish life made up of hard work and materialistic needs.

            "content": "\"may contain spoiler\"\nIt looks like Wild Strawberries implies the nostalgia and the translation has lost the true meaning. This is because Wild Strawberries are the memory of the short nice warm summer in the normally cold Sweden. In this movie, Bergman digs into the layers of the personality of the protagonist once more, this time with everything being around the concept of love (he later made \"through a glass darkly\" where he talks about faith and love. However, love is not the main theme there). \nThere are to time directions in the movie as the movie goes on: 1- in the forward direction, the memories of the protagonist, Dr. Isak Borg, from his childhood to his more mature state of being. He deals with his memories in the face of death. As it is captured in a scene from his car, everything is forward, youth, middle ages, and current state, from back to the front seat of the car. He is in a state composed of dreams (his dreams) and intellectualism (discussions with his daughter in law) and he can clearly understand his remorse (unsuccessful loveless marriage in the shadow of his conceitedness; his life which is wasted on his passion with abstract science, something that he cannot remember anything of it in a surreal scene of his ridiculing examination in an exam room, something that cannot help him; his refrain from approaching Sarah (the way he sees the event. however the event might have happened in another way: Sarah has chosen Victor-Isak's brother- over him, which can be supported by hitchhiker Sarah's argument over her decision between the two other hitchhikers); being betrayed by his wife; not staying at the small town of the gas station, where his science would not remain abstract, where the people would admire him and his work; and finally his relationship with his mother) and remembers his happy moments of life (Sarah and his parents).\nHowever, 2 - as the hand-less clock in his dream depicts, time does not have a neither meaning nor direction here. He lives concurrent with the events from the past (memories) in different time directions. In fact, time and time direction are both undefined. The second direction is how Isak captures himself: from an old age university professor at the beginning of the movie towards his childhood at the end of the movie when he encounters his parents at a scenery lake, next to his childhood house, from his outer-most level of personality towards the inner-most level. There is only one character who represents Isak at all ages, but the sensuality and dreams define him.\nNow let's see what makes Isak happy and calm out of this turbulent journey and what does he remember right before death. The answer is love, and looks like Bergman has a special credit for the love of Isak for his parents (something that he does not utter but it is sunk at the deepest level of his mind). This claim might be disputed based on Bergman's self relationship with his parents, specifically his father.\nThe Wild Strawberries has inspired the movie, \"eternity and a day\" directed by Theodoros Angelopoulos. Despite being strong, the latter falls short with respect to the Wild Strawberries.",

Wild Strawberries has intelligent and well thought out cinematography, and if there's one overwhelming positive to be walked away with, it's that this is worth watching for the sheer craft of it.  There's always a lot going on, from the visuals to the conversational topics, and that's in spite of this not the fastest paced of films.

Superbly written and directed by Ingmar Bergman, we all follow the doctor on a journey where he will be honoured for the fiftieth anniversary of receiving his degree. We find out through the real directing poetry, that for Doctor Borg, this journey is from  life to death while he travels besieged by memories. \r\n\r\nThe original Swedish title is Smultronst\u00e4llet, which literally means \"the wild strawberry patch\", but idiomatically means an underrated gem of a place (often with personal or sentimental value) - and that is a perfect title for this classical work of art. . I watched it few times, since I was 13 and always managed to find something new in it... but Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m's acting wasn't new... it was seen and perfect together with my favourite Ingrid Thulin.  Bergman's immediate choice for the leading role of the old professor was Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m (Bergman's silent film idol) and they both did a great job working together while Ingrid Thulin plays Marianne, the sad gentle and warm daughter-in-law of Borg. The interesting thing is that Bergman wrote the screenplay of Wild Strawberries in Stockholm's Karolinska Hospital (the workplace of Isak Borg).  \r\n\r\nThis is one of the greatest films ever, if you ask me! It won the Golden Bear for Best Film at the 8th Berlin International Film Festival, \"Best Film\" and \"Best Actor\" at the Mar del Plata Film Festival and won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film in 1960. It was also nominated for an Academy Award for Original Screenplay. The film is included on the Vatican Best Films List, recommended for its portrayal of a man's \"interior journey from pangs of regret and anxiety to a refreshing sense of peace and reconciliation\". In a 1963 interview with Cinema magazine Stanley Kubrick listed the film as his second favourite of all time.\r\n\r\nIt should be on everyone's \"must see\" list!",

            "content": "As of this review, I must shamefully admit that Wild Strawberries is still the only Bergman film I've seen. Yet the way it has stuck with me is a testament to Bergman's intimate understanding of the human psyche: fear, desire, regret, loss, cynicism. Bergman managed to coax legendary silent film director, Victor Sjostrom, out of retirement to star as Isak Borg, an aging professor who is traveling to receive an honourary degree. His performance is poweful, and much of the impact of the film's meditation on loss and mortality comes from the metanarrative similarities between Borg, Sjostrom, and Bergman himself. The story is structured as an early road movie, in which Borg recounts memories of the past during his trip, meeting people along the way who remind him of others he once knew. While Bergman's masterful use of symbolism is a subject that could fill a graduate thesis, and is too much to explore in this short review, it is sufficient to state it is in prime form here, and much of the joy of watching the film comes from seeing the ways Bergman weaves symbolism with narrative. Ultimately, Wild Strawberries is a humanist piece that suggests it is our relationships with people, rather than our accomplishments, that will come to define us in our final hour. Surprisingly uplifting  in the end, this is a film worth visiting again and again.",

Elderly doctor journeys from Stockholm to Lund, the location of his alma mater, in order to pick up honorary degree, meeting some likeable, and some unlikeable characters along the way, and pausing for a break at the house of his childhood. That's pretty much all that actually happens in this film, so if you're looking for plot thrills then don't bother to spend 100 minutes of your life watching this. However, if you have the appetite for a dense character study whereby you'll encounter a crotchety, egotistical buffoon at first and end up rooting for him as he finally realises what has been missing all of his life then this is for you. The dream and daydream sequences, particularly the distressingly recognisable nightmare Dr Borg (played to perfection by Victor Sjostrom in his final role; just 3 years away from his own death he lends a completely natural performance to a character who knows it's all coming to an end and there is so much that could have been different and better) has at the beginning of the film, where he dreams his own funeral in a small deserted town are captivating and visually the strongest part of the work.\n\nA wonderful film which bears any number of repeated, regular viewings.",

Don't get me wrong \"Wild Strawberries\" is a strong film that is quite brilliant at times, but I'll take something like \"The Seventh Seal\" or \"Persona\" over this any day. Now, I'll admit, I'm not too good at analyzing these type of films, but like most of Bergman films there's a deeper meaning hidden with everything. Some deal with the harsh realities of life and others ask the question if God exists. I think \"Wild Strawberries\" does a bit a both, and that's probably why it has become one of the most critically lauded films in the European canon. Again, like all other Bergman films, \"Wild Strawberries\" is technically great. The cinematography is beautiful, the acting is wonderful and story is rather touching at times.\r\n\r\nThe film does a magnificent job of taking the viewer inside the life of Isak Borg. While watching the viewer sees that Borg has lived a cold existence and because of this he is all alone, with the exception of his house maid. He lost the one true love of his life, Sara, to his brother and as he got older he became more and more selfish. Borg senses that he is approaching his inevitable death and during his trip to receive his honorary award he is haunted by his past memories. He must deal with his faults and worry wether or not he will be judged for all his wrong doings once he is dead. \"Wild Strawberries\" is a good film that beautifully ask some important questions, however, I just find this to be inferior to Bergman's other work.",

Sjstrm is magnificent in the lead role, and the film has a great sense of mystery and subtle horror to it that I for one was fascinated during the entire duration of it.

What a flipped charmer. What a knock out of the park. What a way to serialize mortality with enlightenment, and carefully translate the familiarity of everyday life with the specific resemblance of teatime dreams. With that \"Wild Strawberries\" romanticizes so surreally a single man's intellectual cripple that he enters the modern age kicking and screaming and breaks Ingmar Bergman's fourth wall. It's clear he doesn't just have connections with each of his characters, but shaped relationships, personal because they're each united states.\n\nEveryone's different degrees of lost in \"Wild Strawberries\", starting first and foremost with patriarch Isak Borg (Victor Sjostrom), a physician under a gravely influence and the remarkable ability to recall his past lives in slumber. His dreams are all that keep him running, and the only falsities he should choose to trust. Daughter-in-law Marianna (Ingrid Thulin) is unsettled to discover she can relate with Isak's doubts, being pregnant and thinking of splitting with Isak's son Evlund and all. Watch the two in the front seat of Isak's car, as Isak discloses to her his having to imagine being dead in order to convince others there's still something beating inside of him. Then a trio of hitchhikers Marianne and Isak have picked up en route to Lund, Sweden, where the latter is to accept a landmark medical award, approach Isak's window and hand him a picked bouquet of flowers. He knows the world by heart, they tell him. If only he could just appreciate the gesture; he's too broken from the aged decease of his wife to comprehend the arms open around him. \n\nIsak isn't a martyr, nor is Bergman. They both of them believe that only through blood can the light of truth be crystal. Isak might have seen his wife as his own, and the kid in Marianne's belly his last untouched heir, but he's moreover jealous of either. He knows the world's heart well enough to understand there isn't much of one to listen for.",

Like DET SJUNDE INSEGLET (The Seventh Seal) and JUNGFRUKAELLAN (The Virgin Spring), it treats issues of religious faith and fear of death, but in a much less coherent way. Yet, SMULTRONSTAELLET may be the most charming and endearing of the trilogy, as we watch a crusty old man examine his past and decide to treat those around him better.\n\nThe Scrooge-like figure is Isak Borg (Viktor Sjostrom), a retired professor of medicine now in his 78th year. Invited from his Stockholm home to receive an honourary degree at Lund University, he decides to travel the distance by car. Accompanying him on this outing is his daughter-in-law Marianne (Ingrid Thulin), who is experiencing marital troubles with his son Evald (Gunnar Bjornstrand). Along the way, Borg stops at some old stomping grounds, such as the summer house he spent his childhood at, and the area where he first practiced medicine. As Borg drifts into reveries of old memories, we discover how he became so bitter and hostile, but Marianne's incisive comments push him towards rediscovering his humanity.\n\nOf course death is an ever-present spectre when Borg is pushing 80. But the strong religious element comes when Borg and Marianne pick up three hitchhikers, a young lady (Bibi Andersson) with her boyfriend and a family-appointed chaperone. One of these lads wants to be a priest and has strong faith, while the other is hoping to become a doctor and doubts the existence of a god. They quarrel, but somehow this entire matter seems unrelated to the main arc of the film. Similarly baffling is Evald's babblings about how he doesn't want a child because he himself does not want to exist, in which the writing almost seems parody Bergman. \n\nThe acting, however, is superb. Sjostrom really brings his character to life with his initial bah-humbug mannerisms and his later senile puzzlement that he cannot win everyone back to him right away. It's amusing to see Bibi Andersson playing a ditzy teenager, a role light years away from her intense turn in Bergman's PERSONA almost a decade later.\n\nThe most economic way to see SMULTRONSTAELLET is in the Criterion Collection set of four Bergman films from the 1950s.",

But I should come to expect deep when watching Bergman. This film to me was about of course, life, death, existentialism, the existence of god (common Bergman so far) and our being for ourselves and of course others.\r\n\r\nI'm always amazed how he comes out with these stories though. They seem to keep my attention when they shouldn't. Bergman was an innovator in the way stories are told on the screen, they feel so natural. His touch is very sophisticated. But maybe it's the black and white, it's mesmerizing. It could also be the babe combo of Bibi Andersson and Ingrid Thulin....wa wa wee wa.\r\n\r\nI think all the actors did a fine job. I believe that Bergman's strength is the conviction of his actors and the way his stories so effortlessly unfold like onions. This one felt like a road trip movie, which it was. I almost always like those because in film the characters tend to find themselves during those trips, which makes for entertaining cinema for the most part. This one in particular. I love how we see the relationships form on screen, and how subtle the story is tolf through the characters and not by beating us over the head or insulting our intelligence. \r\n\r\n(List of road trip favorites off the top of my head: National Lampoons Vacation, Little Miss Sunshine, Sideways, 28 Days Later, Children of Men....well all of these are to some extent).",

The film's focus is to a contemplating doctor(I cannot say protagonist or  hero) way past his prime, whose existence and mortality was emotionally awaken by a nightmare, where him, standing on an empty street, encounters a version of himself lying inside a coffin.It may have been a more than obvious metaphysical symbolism inserted by Bergman, but I think it's the only way to convey his intent: That a man, when encountered by the very hands of death, even in dreams, is an ironic catalyst for a final salvo to re-discover, appreciate, and face life as it is. This simple plot has since been adapted by mainstream cinema, using a 'roadtrip' to further the exploration of the characters. And it is from that sub-genre alone that I can really set apart \"Wild Strawberries\" from other film of the same type. Although some films derived from the idea has been great pieces of cinema all by itself(e.g. \"About Schmidt\"), this film's approach is what made the difference. \"Wild Strawberries\" gets an omniscient insight through man's regrets, guilt and insecurities not through relatives and some problems that are placed on the end of the road to serve as life-affirming plot devices. Bergman found another alternative: The interior world of one's mind. It's so effective that in the end, even though nothing but a bit of subtle change has transpired in the tangible reality, he was much, much better, and refurnished inside. He may not have expressed everything that he would have said and done before to make it all better, but alas, he already knew, that he can just 'fade' away with a smile.\n\nP.S. Ingrid Thulin was extremely beautiful in this film.",

This amongst other quandaries in his indefinite classic, Wild Strawberries, the coming of death film that takes a top down approach to the typical formula of coming of age. Mind you, this movie was made at the turn of the old world approach so in retrospect over half a century later.\nOther questions:\nIs the post-modern world where expressing ones feelings, removal of old world manners and habits more productive?\nWhat does it mean to be a Swedish woman at the turn from traditional to contemporary?\nIs having ten kids still necessary?\nWhat really happens when one dies?\nHow does someone young judge someone so old?\n\n?A doctor earns more money and ministers are out of date.?says a young Bibi Anderson while discussing her potential marriage partners. As the youngest member of the film, her role carries significant weight as to the effect she has on her elder, Professor Borg.\n\nComing out of age or coming into it, the traditional, rational professor enters the modern world and sees the old traditions being thrown out the window. He doesn?t mind despite appearances as he sees the day devoted to his professorship (he is driving to the ceremony for a well-known achievement in academic award). \nIn his death sentence, the professor observes his childhood crush crush him by marrying his brother, later he observes his deceased wife having a rough and wild rendezvous in the forest, his daughter-in-law accuse him of being rude, callous and unaware of his son?s feelings. The only true praise the old man receives is when he stops at a gas station in a small country town and is admired by the gas attendant and his wife for his service of the town in the past. If only my daughter-in-law could hear this, he thinks and then drives on. Well, she drives on for he may or may not be dead at this point. Of course, the film is blurred between the professor?s dream state and his waking state, divided in Bergman?s brilliant fashion. To observe it from a generation standpoint: Every other line in this film is tumblr quotepic worthy. \n\nThe most important scene could be when the professor, after his day of youthful follies, jumbled events, and death dreams, he asks his maid of thirty odd years who is as stubborn as any old woman could be, if possibly they could call each other by their first names. Of course not, Mr. Borg! First of all, the old lady, who the professor is forced to refer to as Ms. Agada, will not take part in any intimacies. Secondly, what would people think? It would ruin their reputation and have people laugh at them. ?But we?re so old now?, why should that matter contemplates the professor. He realizes she is right as his active maid cleans out his mouth guard and busies herself with something housework related. The old man remains the old man, unable to escape his old world ties as he falls asleep alone. Whether he dies or not, we do not know but at least the professor has his childhood memories to put his mind at ease. \nThe man is too humble, caught in his ways of his cold mother, everyone sees him as cold, dead, and lonely and he only realizes it when it is too late. Is this Bergman?s attempt at telling the rather depressed Swedes to brighten up, and live, after all they have his films to watch and can them understand from a perspective I can only dream about. Probably a death dream at that.",

Particularly interesting are the peculiar dreams Dr. Isak Borg (Victor Sj\u00c3\u00b6str\u00c3\u00b6m) has and the fears and other depressing thoughts they encompass. Similarly I could really appreciate the artistic value of the childhood flashbacks with the protagonist taking an anachronistic walk right through the scenes, making it even more clear that all this very much concerns him, especially in his old-age reveries. The good thing about Smultronst\u00c3\u00a4llet, I think, is that its theme is basic and serious without resulting in the depressing movie one might have expected to ensue from this. The people in the flashbacks and the servant even have some silly caricature qualities, and the quarreling friends and couples also add to the amusement. The various cases of marital friction (in past and present) that are not so jolly could at least be called very realistic and recognizable. This movie is the first Bergman production I ever saw, and I must admit it well exceeded my expectations, effacing the fearful hopes I had of his work.",

I revisited it twice; therefore I am completely certain of this unfortunate revelation. \"Wild Strawberries\" stars Victor Sjostrom as Professor Isak Borg, a seventy-eight year old man who is about to receive an award for his long time profession as a doctor. Except for the opening scene, the film is set in one day; basically a long car ride with few other companions and some people he meets on the way, including his very old mother. As a whole it is about self-discovery; the most impressive parts are the dream sequences where the old man goes back to his childhood. The very first dream is astonishing, no words are spoken and the old man is lost in empty streets which involve a corpse; it has a darker tone to it. Another one later in the film reveals Isak Borg's relationship with his wife, I felt it should have been limited, darker dreams have more power if there aren't any words spoken; the images tell the story. The great Bibi Andersson along with Ingrid Thulin and Gunnar Bjornstrand also appear; I was particularly impressed with Andersson who plays two roles, one in the past and the other in the present. She is incredibly jubilant! I don't really have any eye-opening issues with it. I did felt the characters were a bit constricted. My disappointment is mainly because I had such high hopes, having loved it in my initial viewing (it was my first Bergman), otherwise it's a good, essential work that simply lacks a sort of transcendence, a substance that \"Persona\" has. As of now \"Persona\" and \"Cries and Whispers\" are his two greatest.",

I can't seem to pinpoint the exact reason I have this admiration, but I'll figure it out someday.\r\n\r\nWith Wild Strawberries, I was immediately taken with the visual style of Bergman. I'd already seen a handful of Bergman's works by this point, and the cinematography drew me in as much as, if not more so, than the others did. With as brilliant and great a filmmaker as Ingmar Bergman was, this picture belonged just as much to Victor Sjostrom. There's not one negative thing I could say about this film...",

            "content": "Wild Strawberries is a film by Ingmar Bergman that deals with the fear of death.  The film follows Professor Isak Borg as he is on his way to receive an honorary degree.  Along his journey he is confronted with dreams and flashbacks that show the shortcomings of his life and his approaching death.  Through these experiences Isak begins to learn where he failed and how, even later on he can change and rediscover himself.  \r\n\r\nThe film shows what really matter in the end in an interesting and true way.  Isak consistently has flashbacks to his childhood and the times of life he most treasured.  These are vivid, clear, and consistent.  What Isak does not seem to recall much of is what the world would call his prime.  In one dream he fails his examination and cannot remember anything he learned and proceeds to relive a moment where he caught his wife with someone else.  This dream implies that the prime of life is fleeting and ultimately forgotten; it is one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s childhood that often is what returns the closer to death one gets.  As Isak recognizes his coming death it makes his childhood seem so much clearer and he realizes that there really wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that long in between.\r\n\r\nBergman again addresses his own fears of death and the fact that as he gets older the things from his childhood become clearer again.  Throughout the film there are hints of birth and death being close together symbolizes how close our birth and death really is.  There are many allegories within the film and it would take more than one watch to fully understand all that is within the film.  Bergman directs another masterpiece and it is one that can easily and directly relate to all kinds of people.\r\n\r\nWild Strawberries is an impressive technical achievement too.  The music is perfectly matched to the scenes and themes and the sounds (as Bergman always does) enhance the viewing experience and completely add impact to the scene they are in.  The acting is great and the photography and editing is perfect.  The opening scene with him at his desk is beautiful and the following scene of his dream/nightmare the night before is haunting and inspired.  Bergman took great effort to make that scene perfect and it is fully captured that way from the sound of the heartbeats in silence to the extreme light to the body that virtually disintegrates to the coffin which falls off the buggy and contains a frightening discovery for Isak.  The whole film is a work of art and a masterpiece and is yet another one of Bergman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proving his greatness as a director.",

            "content": "This did not disappoint. From the opening nightmare, which is strikingly haunting, to the final look on Victor Sjostrom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, as his Professor Borg lays in bed and contemplates the fullness of his life, I found the film to be a wonderfully sophisticated work. I found it to be different from the other films of his I have seen, Winter Light and The Seventh Seal, in a sense that it felt warmer and more elegant overall, especially with Borg finally conceding and reciprocating his family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love at the end.\n\nHowever, the surreal imagery and chastising dark revelations to the main character are still there, and I think that Bergman hits a flawless balance between handling his themes with gentle commisseration and with penetrating consequence. Sjostrom wonderfully plays Isak Borg, as we see the character change so genuinely throughout the course of his reinacted memories, and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ever seem forced or trite. He does most of the acting with his facial expressions as he watches his childhood memories unfold before him. The same originality and honesty goes for the things that press Borg about his life, as Bergman decides the most prevalent flaw for the Professor: underneath his mechanical \u00e2\u0080\u009cnice\u00e2\u0080\u009d behavior, he is selfish and ruthless, which is a powerful thing to address about anyone. It is open for interpretation, as the ending is bittersweet. Borg realizes his flaws and makes amends with his family, and is told that he is now well-liked. However, he is still an old man who feels he has wasted his life.\n\nAs usual, this is beautifully shot, with very heavy light and dark contrasts. Borg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dreamscapes seem surreal with blurred shadow here and there. The music is forboding yet somber. Bibi Andersson, Ingrid Thulin, and Gunnar Bjornstrand are their usual selves, providing an incredible supporting cast. Thulin really shone the most for me, as Marianne wound up being one of the best female characters I have seen in quite some time. She is empathetic and forgiving of Borg, yet she is also the one who is the most blunt with him about his behaviors as a human being. While we may fault her for being as blunt as she is, we can only thank her for her help by the end. When all is said and done, these words from Bibi Anderrson provide hope of reconcile for our main character:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGoodbye, Father Isak. Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the one I love? Today, tomorrow, and forever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

While hollywood still had a backdrop-hollywood feel to it, with very over the top performances which reminded us more of theater, Bergman wanted realism out of his actors, which is proven by the performances which are all fantastic, and as I said, feel real.

It's about a 76-years old professor who goes on a road trip with his daughter in-law to receive an honorary doctorate degree. On their way, he had weird dreams, going back to his past. In these dreams and day-time imaginations, he's able to see the girl he loved, Sara, who married to his good-for-nothing brother. Besides remembering these unhappy moments, he also remembers his own bitter marriage, and self-reflection of his deeds and his punishment, \"loneliness\". As the plot seems sad and boring, I had to force myself to watch it, but surprisingly it's very enjoyable and sweet. He meets another Sara on the way, a young girl, who is accompanied by two men. They hitched a ride with the old man and his daughter in-law. They have an accident with another car on the way, and that car breaks down, the couple in the car, who are constantly arguing with each other in comedic ways, hitched a ride with the old man's group, adding to the lively dialogues, mood and comedy of the film.
