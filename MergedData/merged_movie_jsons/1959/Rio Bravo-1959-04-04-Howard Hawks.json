            "content": "For many, Hawks' 'Rio Bravo' is the perfect Western... For me it is the antithesis of 'High Noon,' and the clearest exposition of Hawks' philosophy of professionalism... His tough lawman solves his own problem without going out looking for help... So he welcomes volunteers and in fact depends on them... What is more, he wins by displaying superior skills and quicker wits...The survivors in Hawks' philosophy are the ones who conduct themselves with the greatest degree of coolness and discipline... It is not difficult to appreciate why Hawks has used substantially the 'Rio Bravo' plot, with only minor variations in both his subsequent Westerns, 'El Dorado' and 'Rio Lobo.'In Fred Zinneman's 'High Noon,' Gary Cooper struggles to round up a posse that might help him deal with four desperadoes arriving on a noon train to kill him... In \"Rio Bravo,\" John Wayne is faced with a similar situation but takes on the forces of evil in the shape of a gang of local tyrants... Wayne always makes us feel that somehow he'll cope... So when the wagon master Ward Bond asks him if he wants to use any of his men as deputies in fighting Burdette's men, he turns down the offer... Wayne, holding a brutish prisoner Joe Burdette (Claude Akins) on a murder charge, waits for the U.S. marshal to take charge of him... But the prisoner's powerful brother Nathan (John Russell) wants him free and is determined to release him by any method possible...The obvious method is the traditional one\u0097hired gunmen\u0097and, in effect, the sheriff becomes a prisoner himself, in his own town\u0085 But in this instance the lawman is not absolutely without help... The two deputies are a semi-crippled veteran (Walter Brennan) and a pretty hopeless drunk with a past 'fast' reputation (Dean Martin). But the whole point about this cleverly conceived movie is that this unlikely trio do in fact have something to offer when the cards are dealt... Like the sheriff, they're professional people, and what Hawks seems to be saying is that whatever the odds, such people will always have the courage, and the deeds... This is demonstrated in one inspired sequence which has become a classic: Dean Martin \u0096 drying out and eager to win back his self-respect \u0096 tells Chance that he wants to be the one who chase the killer into a saloon, and that Chance should assume the less dangerous role of backing him up from the back door...'Rio Bravo' is a beautifully controlled film... John Wayne, who re-created and heightened the mythology of the West, is at his best...John Ford imitates Howard Hawks' tendency for having his male characters never back down from a fight even when it means they are initiating the fight themselves... In Rio Bravo's famous wordless opening, villain Claude Akins throws a silver dollar into a spittoon, daring Dude, so desperate for a drink, to humiliate himself, and get the coin... Hawks' clever camera emphasizes how far beneath the standards Dude has fallen... Now Wayne is ready to confront Akins...The same scene in Ford's 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.' Lee Marvin trips unarmed James Stewart as he carries a steak dinner to Wayne in the restaurant where he works... He stumbles and the steak falls to the ground... Stewart has been obviously humiliated... Suddenly Wayne enters the frame, and orders Valance to peak up 'his' steak, revealing his gun belt as he faces him... He is ready for the showdown...In 'Rio Bravo,' Hawks' men win out primarily because they fight together... But Hawks helps them by having the outlaws mistakenly play a Mexican tune called 'cutthroat,' a song which Santa Anna tried to intimidate the Texans under siege in the Alamo... As the music plays, we see Dude putting down his glass untouched... He observes that his hands no longer shake...In Hawks' 'Rio Bravo' there is tenderness, and humor... In Hawks' film, a man is defined by how well he relates to women, how well he handles pressure and how he reacts to danger... Angie Dickinson playing the gambling gal, enriches the mixture with a nicely judged performance... 'Rio Bravo' is an action Western, which captures a legendary West that fits the legendary talents of Wayne and Hawks... But what makes the film so special is the relationship between the individual characters... It is a traditional, straightforward Western, good-humored and exciting, rich in original touches...The best moment of the film when Martin and Nelson join each other for some singing and guitar picking, and Walter Brennan joins in with his harmonica and his scratchy voice... The film has a terrific score by one of the great film composers Dimitri Tiomkin...",

            "content": "Howard Hawks initially wanted to reunite John Wayne and Montgomery Clift who had worked so well together in Red River in his second film with Wayne. Clift however was at the beginning of the slide that would ultimately destroy him in seven years and said no. It was then that Dean Martin was cast as John Wayne's alcoholic deputy. By the way if Clift had done the part it would have reunited him with Walter Brennan also who is playing a very similar part to the one he did in Red River in relation to Wayne.In the wordless beginning of Rio Bravo, Wayne while going into the town saloon to fetch Dino, witnesses a cold blooded killing perpetrated by Claude Akins. Akins is the no good brother of rich rancher John Russell who keeps trying to spring Akins from Wayne's jail. He also brings in some hired guns who bottle the town up.Both Howard Hawks and John Wayne absolutely hated High Noon and made Rio Bravo as their answer to it. This sheriff doesn't go around begging for help from the townspeople he's sworn to protect. He's supposed to be good enough to handle the job himself with some help from only a few good men.Dean Martin said that the Rio Bravo role for him was one of the most difficult. At that time he was playing a drunk on stage and was not yet into the substance abuse problems that beset him later on. But turns in a stellar performance.This film marked the farewell feature film performance of Ward Bond who took some time from his Wagon Train TV series to play the small role of a Wayne friend who offers to help and gets killed for his trouble. Fitting it should be in the starring film of his best friend John Wayne.The only bad note in Rio Bravo is that of Ricky Nelson who is too much the nice kid from Ozzie and Harriet to suggest being a young gun. But Rio Bravo marked the first of many films Wayne used a current teenage idol to insure box office. Later on Frankie Avalon, Fabian, Bobby Vinton all the way down to Ron Howard in The Shootist brought a younger audience in for the Duke. James Caan who played the Ricky Nelson part in El Dorado was much superior to Nelson. Then again, Caan is an actor. But I will say that Dean and Ricky sung real pretty.When you hear Dean singing My Rifle, Pony, and Me in the jailhouse, you might recognize the same melody from Red River as Settle Down. Dimitri Tiomkin wrote it and Dean recorded it as well as the title song for Capitol records. At Capitol Dino did mostly ersatz Italian ballads, it was what he was identified with. When he switched to Reprise, Dino started doing far more country and western and it really starts with the songs he did in Rio Bravo.Rio Bravo is a leisurely paced western, probably one of the slowest John Wayne ever did. But Howard Hawks created some characters and a story that hold the interest through out.",

            "content": "There are quite a few seminal classic American westerns (such as 'High Noon', 'The Searchers', 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' or 'Shane' - to name but a few), but 'Rio Bravo' ended up being my favorite among those. It's the quintessential film of the genre, yet although it delivers pretty much all of the classic western tropes in spades, I think the main reason I love it so much is because it's also such a great buddy movie.Pairing John Wayne's stoic hero sheriff against the self-deprecating wit of Dean Martin's alcoholic deputy was a stroke of genius, as was the casting of a very charming Angie Dickinson in the female lead role and veteran Walter Brennan as grumpy old Stumpy. The constant bickering between all the main characters makes 'Rio Bravo' so much fun, but the humor in the great script and the wonderful performances by the game cast are only half of what makes this movie so great.The other quality 'Rio Bravo' has which makes it stand out among other greats of the genre is its mood. There's an almost apocalyptic sense of doom permeating the movie throughout, and that constant dread combined with the film's humor - which is often of the gallows' kind - gives it a special kind of atmosphere that other classic American westerns of that era lack. What also adds to that unique tone of the movie is the central piece of music, the hauntingly beautiful Mexican ballad 'El Deguello' which plays an important role in the film.'Rio Bravo' was the last truly great movie by one of the towering figures from Hollywood's \"Golden Age\", Howard Hawks (who had previously made such classics as 'Scarface', 'Red River' 'The Big Sleep', 'His Girl Friday', 'To Have And Have Not' and many more). The veteran director seemed to have realized he had made something special too, as he went on to remake 'Rio Bravo' not once but twice during his remaining years. In fact, his two last films were those two remakes ('El Dorado' in '67 and 'Rio Lobo' in '70). Both films featured John Wayne in the lead role, and while they're both solid westerns, they couldn't quite capture the unique charm of the original.As it is, 'Rio Bravo' remains a highly influential classic (Quentin Tarantino cites it as one his favorite movies) and a masterpiece of the western genre. 10 stars out of 10.P.S.

            "content": "When Joe Burdette (Claude Akins) murders a man on a whim, Sheriff John T. Chance (John Wayne) arrests him and puts him in small Texas town's jail. The problem is that the U.S. Marshall is a week away from taking Burdette off his hands, and Burdette's brother, Nathan (John Russell), won't see his brother put away. Complicating the situation even further, Burdette is rich enough to hire a score of thugs, and the only support that Chance has is from a drunk, Dude (Dean Martin), and an elderly crippled man, Stumpy (Walter Brennan).Rio Bravo is a sprawling pressure cooker. For anyone not used to the pacing of older films, this is not the best place to begin. Uninitiated audiences are likely to find it boring--the plot is relatively simple, and they would likely have a difficult time remaining with Rio Bravo for its 2 hour and 21 minute running time. It's best to wait until one is acclimated to this kind of pacing, so as not to spoil the experience. The film is well worth it.John Wayne was an enthralling paradox, and maybe no film better demonstrates why than Rio Bravo. He had almost delicate \"pretty boy\" looks and a graceful gait that were an odd contrast to his hulking height and status as the \"action hero\" of his day. He speaks little, and doesn't need to, although he is the star and thus the center of attention. He tends to have an odd smirk on his face. Wayne's performance here interestingly parallels the pacing and tenor of the film--that's not something that one sees very often, or at least it's not something that's very easy to make conspicuous.And he's not the only charismatic cast member. Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, Walter Brennan and Angie Dickinson are equally captivating. Even when the full blow-out action sequence begins (and that's not until about two hours into the film, although there are a few great shorter action scenes before that), the focus here is still on the interrelationships between these characters, with Brennan the continually funny comic foil, Nelson the suave, skilled youngster, Martin the complex and troubled but likable complement to Wayne, and Dickinson as the sexy, forward and clever love interest.Director Howard Hawks seems to do everything right. He guides cinematographer Russell Harlan in capturing subtly beautiful scenery--like the mountains in the distance over the tops of some buildings, and a great sunrise shot--and asks for an atmospheric score (such as the repeated playing of Malaguena by a band in the background) that shows that plot points weren't the only element of the film that influenced John Carpenter (who partially based his Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) on this film). But most intriguing is probably Hawks' staging/blocking. You could easily make a study of just that aspect of the film. The characters are always placed in interesting places in the frame, and they're constantly moving in interesting ways throughout the small collection of buildings and streets that make up the town. There is almost a kind of performance art aspect to it. Wayne, for instance, repeatedly touches base at the jail, then picks up his rifle, circles around to the hotel and back, almost as if he's doing some kind of western Tai Chi.Rio Bravo is nothing if not understated, and as such, it may take some adjustments from modern, especially younger, viewers. But it's a gem of a film, and worth watching and studying.",

            "review_title": "Hawks' last masterpiece",
            "content": "Disregarded at the time of its release, and still underrated by many critics, Rio Bavo is finally coming into its own as a masterpiece. One reason that it has been underrated is that,it does not seem a typical western for the fifties. Most of the great westerns of the period were darker and moodier. Witness for example, the great films of Boetticher and Anthony Mann, or-the supreme example-The Searchers.Others were 'revisionist' and often sought to convey a socially conscious \"teaching'- High Noon is the paradigm here. In contrast, Rio Bravo is unashamedly reactionary. Hawks actually claimed to have made the film as a reply to High Noon..In addition, there are very few pyschological or moral ambiguities here. Instead, we get a classic Hawksian scenario, also found in Only Angels Have Wings and To Have and Have Not. . in which a groups of misfits and outsiders bands together to defeat  evil. Here we have John Wayne- offering a performance of considerable subtlety and self knowledge- as the valiant, yet limited, patriarchal hero, John T. Chance. To save the day, he calls on a cast of standard Western characters:The old-timer( Brennan), the reformed drunk( Martin), The \"kid'( Nelson), and the \"hooker with a heart of gold( Dickinson).Thanks to Hawks' assured, efficient, direction,All of these actors transcend the stereotypes usually associated with such characters to deliver fine performances which are simultaneously \"realistic' and archtypal. Particularly worthy of notice is Dean Martin. John Carpenter once claimed that the scene of Martin's \"redemption\" was the greatest moment in all of cinema. That may be an exaggeration, but Carpenter has a point. It is both moving and unforgettable.In short, Rio Bravo is a triumph for Howard Hawks and his seemingly artless art.",

            "review_title": "It only gets better each time I see it.",
            "content": "I noticed that a few reviewers gave RIO BRAVO scores of 10. Well, I certainly can understand this, as it is one of the better Westerns you can see, but I also am very hesitant to toss out 10s--as not many movies are perfect enough to merit this score. And, while I loved RIO BRAVO, I also must admit that there are a few films of the genre that are better...though not many.One thing I noticed as I saw this film again today is that it is so much better than I'd remembered. Some of this might be because there are a lot of details about films and film making I notice now that I have a bazillion film reviews behind me--I couldn't help but learn a little bit after seeing so many films. Some of it might also be that despite me knowing the plot and knowing exactly what would happen, it just didn't get old--it was that well made.Now the plot itself is amazingly simple and is not 100% new (hence, my giving the film a 9). The idea of a lawman or group of lawmen refusing to give up a murderer to a rich and powerful boss and steadfastly enforcing the law is such a classic plot line. However, this film is a great example of taking a standard plot yet making it come alive due to such incredibly deft direction. Howard Hawks was a master director with a ton of wonderful films to his credit. You can really tell he knew his craft, as he brought so much out of the actors and situation. In some ways, I even preferred it over the John Ford style, as Ford is usually very, very heavy on the sentimentality. Here, while there is a tiny bit, the emphasis seems to be more on character development, redemption and the individual's interactions with each other. Somewhat similar to Ford--just with less of the lovely schmaltz that Ford did so well. I love both style--and it's amazing that Hawks really only made a few Westerns.In some ways, this film seems a bit surprising for a John Wayne film. While Wayne is naturally known for his extreme manliness in his movies, here he is more complex and vulnerable. First, his romantic pairing with a much younger Angie Dickenson is odd but somehow they make it work and bring out a bit more complexity to his character. Second, there is a lot of wonderful male bonding in the film--and a lot of tenderness. This is not a homophobic film, as the men truly seem to love and care for each other in a way you often don't see in Westerns. It's not all toughness but the vulnerability of the characters (especially Dean Martin) was endearing. Also, while it was very, very atypical of Wayne, I loved the scene where he kissed Walter Brennan on top of the head--it was wonderful and made me laugh. It's funny, because as it was about to happen I said to myself that if Wayne should kiss Brennan, it would be the perfect scene...and then he did! One thing that worried me about the film was that in several Wayne films of the late 50s and into the early 70s, Wayne had young pop singers play important roles. While this sometimes worked, sometimes the acting and characters didn't really pan out well (such as Bobby Vinton playing Wayne's son in BIG JAKE). Here, fortunately, Ricky Nelson actually was a positive addition. Not only did his acting seem polished (after years of playing on \"Ozzie and Harriet\") but his singing actually worked well--even if the style was anachronistic to the Old West. I particularly liked his little duet with Dean Martin. As for Martin, he showed that despite the Matt Helm films and his laid back attitude towards acting in the 70s, he was a terrific actor.As for everyone else, they were in top form. Wayne was a gentler and more believable guy--but still the John Wayne everyone wanted to see. Walter Brennan was downright hilarious as the cantankerous old cuss he grew into in his later years (though he was actually a bit younger than he looked and acted). Angie Dickenson also had more depth and appeal than usual. Interestingly, Hawks and the script put so much emphasis on the good guys that the bad guys were almost an after-thought. This isn't a bad thing, as the film chose instead to deal with the way the good guys got along and worked together as friends.Exceptional direction, great acting and a top-notch script, this is a fine film and one any fan of Westerns or John Wayne simply has to watch. I liked the trivia section of IMDb and its entry that says \"Quentin Tarantino has said that before he enters into a relationship with a girl, he always shows her 'Rio Bravo' and if she doesn't like it, there is no relationship.\" I would agree. Anyone who doesn't like this film after seeing it isn't to be trusted! By the way, although I love this film, I am less in love with EL DORADO. A decade later, Hawks basically redid RIO BRAVO (again, with Wayne) and it offers no improvements at all over the original. Hawks denied that it was a remake and if you believe that, I'll sell you some oceanfront property in Colorado! It's watchable, but you see the two side-by-side, there's simply no comparison.",

            "review_title": "Howard Hawks could perhaps have learned something from \"High Noon\"",
            "content": "\"Rio Bravo\" is sometimes described as a right-wing riposte to Fred Zinnemann's \"High Noon\". I am not sure why \"High Noon\" needed a right-wing riposte, because it has never seemed to me to be particularly left-wing. On a literal level it deals with a subject- the need for a strong stance on law and order- which has always been dear to the hearts of conservatives, and on a metaphorical level it would be just as easy to read a right-wing meaning into it as it would a left-wing one. (Given that the film was made during the Korean War, it would be easy to see Sheriff Kane as a symbol of America as the world's policeman, Frank Miller and his gang as Stalin, Mao and the other Communist leaders and the cowardly townspeople as the anti-war movement in the West). The received idea that the film is an allegory for McCarthyism has always struck me as a strained interpretation.It would appear, however, that what angered Howard Hawks and John Wayne about \"High Noon\" was not so much Zinnemann's views on McCarthyism but rather his implication that the citizens of Hadleyville are cowards for refusing to help Kane. This seems to have inspired the most direct reference to the earlier film in \"Rio Bravo\". When it is suggested to John Wayne's Sheriff John T. Chance that he should round up a posse, he replies that asking amateurs to help him fight hardened professional gunmen would only give the villains more targets to shoot at. The inference is that Gary Cooper's character was wrong to ask the townsfolk to risk their lives on his behalf.The two films are, in fact, broadly similar in plot. Both concern a courageous and incorruptible Sheriff taking on a gang of dangerous villains who are threatening the peace of a whole community. (This basic plot was used in numerous other Westerns, such as \"Dodge City\" and \"Gunfight at the OK Corral\"). In \"Rio Bravo\" Chance has arrested a local hoodlum named Joe Burdette on suspicion of murder. Burdette's brother Nathan, a wealthy rancher, organises a gang of gunfighters to try and free him from the jail. Chance has to try and hold off the thugs for several days until the US Marshal arrives to take Joe to stand trial.His chances of doing so, however, seem slim, because his only assistance comes from his deputies, one of whom, Dude, is an alcoholic and the other, Stumpy, is a one-legged old man. (Was Dude the inspiration for Gene Wilder's character in \"Blazing Saddles\"?) Dude and Stumpy, however, find reserves of courage within themselves, and Chance recruits another volunteer, a young gunman named Colorado who has seen his boss murdered by the villains. \"Rio Bravo\", in fact, is not simply an action film, but also a character study. One of its themes is the way in which the characters battle to overcome their problems- Stumpy's disability, Dude's alcoholism and, in Colorado's case, his initial moral cowardice and reluctance to assist.Colorado is played by Ricky Nelson, a teenage pop star of the period, who was brought in to try and attract a younger audience. He was, however, only seventeen when filming started, and seems far too young and callow for the role. If Chance was so concerned about avoiding innocent casualties, he would no doubt have sent such an inexperienced greenhorn back home to mother before the shooting started. Walter Brennan's Stumpy can seem a bit irritating, but with those exceptions the acting is mostly good. I am of the generation which always thinks of Angie Dickinson as the sexy older woman in \"Police Woman\", so this film gave me the opportunity to see what she looked like as a sexy younger woman. (Very nice too). Chance is the sort of role which John Wayne excelled in portraying, but the best performance came from Dean Martin as Dude, a man who finds redemption for his past misdeeds. There is also a good cameo from John Wayne's close friend Ward Bond as Pat Wheeler, Colorado's murdered boss.The main difference between this film and \"High Noon\" is not one of politics but of style. \"High Noon\" is shot in real time and conveys an urgent sense of time rushing towards the final showdown; it also observes the Classical unity of action as well as that of time, with no digressions from the main plot. \"Rio Bravo is much more leisurely and spacious, running to nearly 2\u00bd hours. Besides the main action there is also a subplot detailing Chance's burgeoning romance with Dickinson's character, a female card-sharp and good-time girl named Feathers, and plenty of comic relief involving Carlos the Mexican barman (who closely resembles Manuel in \"Fawlty Towers\") and even Stumpy, who for all his bravery is often treated as a comic character. Of the two films, my preference is definitely for \"High Noon\". \"Rio Bravo\" never drags, as there is always something going on to hold one's interest, but it lacks the gripping pacing which makes \"High Noon\" one of the most thrilling films ever made. (In my view it is perhaps the greatest Western ever). Hawks may have disagreed with Zinnemann over politics, but he could perhaps have learned something from him about film-making. 7/10",

Rating : Above average, essential and indispensable Western , a masterpiece horse opera whose reputation has improved over the years.It's followed by \u00a8El Dorado\u00a8in similar style with a hot-headed James Caan as Mississipi who is a virtual retreat of the previous young sidekick named Colorado-Ricky Nelson. Howard Hawks also displays a number of similarities to the posterior \u00a8Rio Lobo\u00a8 staring Wayne, Victor French, Jorge Rivero and again with an old short-tempered person played by Jack Elam. Furthermore, a semi-remake on modern times by John Carpenter was called \u00a8Assault on Precinct 13\u00a8.",

            "content": "It says much about current cinema that this vintage slice of Hollywood is now considered too long and too slow by the modern generation of movie goers.  Howard Hawks labours to create setting, mood and pace introducing genuine characters are colourful for the flaws they have as their positive points presenting heroes one can empathise with, people with three dimensions, not thin caricatures that popular many of today's movies.No character empathises this more than Dean Martin's broken down drunk Dude. Nicknamed \"Borachon\" by the Mexicans (Borachon is Spanish for \"Drunkard\") Dude battles with the demons that drove him to drink as he desperately tried not to let down Sheriff Chance, John Wayne, who believes in him more than he believes in himself.  Dude's pouring back of a glass of bourbon into the bottle is one of the most life affirming scenes ever committed to film.Wayne never really does anything other than play John Wayne and Hawks spins on this playing with the ethos of the man.  The same steadfast values that mean Wayne's Sheriff John T. Chance will not release the prisoner Joe Burdette back to his murderous gang leave him stiff and awkward in front of Angie Dickinson's love interest \"Feathers\" creating perhaps the quintessential John Wayne movie in which the Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett's screenplay explores the depths of the ideals that Wayne stands for.  This is a movie about not just about redemption, but about the reasons for a tough redemption in a World in which collapse and lawlessness are easier options.And when Dude pours his Bourbon back, affirming that even though he cannot be the man he was but he can still be a good man, you will not be wishing it was film in bullettime.",

Rio Bravo I accept has been acclaimed, but when I saw it myself, I liked it but I wouldn't go to say it is the best western ever. Starting with its problems, it is much too long, it could have done with being 8-10 minutes shorter. Also I have seen reviews not on here that say it is majestically paced but I cannot say I agree, I for one found it too slow. While there was some good acting, Angie Dickinson does overdo her part and it doesn't help her character and situation are both underdeveloped. So what were the good things? Well the scenery and cinematography are magnificent, the score rousing, haunting and bombastic, the story intriguing, the dialogue excellent and the direction superb. And John Wayne, while he has been better, does give a good and charismatic performance in the lead, while Dean Martin is likable enough and Walter Brennan is wonderful. Overall, it is good but not as good as I'd heard it was. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Rio Bravo is perhaps the finest work of director Howard Hawks, and also one of Wayne's very best films. It was made as a response to High Noon, which is sometimes thought to be an allegory for blacklisting in Hollywood, as well as a critique of McCarthyism. Wayne would later call High Noon \"un-American\" and say he did not regret helping run the writer, Carl Foreman, out of the country. Wayne teamed up with director Howard Hawks to tell the story his way. In Rio Bravo, Chance is surrounded by allies - allegorical representations of countries.But over all the deep content that it has, that may be worth of various re-watches, it is an excellent film telling a somewhat entertaining story about a sheriff keeping in jail a bandit, brother of the bandit leader. Although, the allegorical part really plays big in this film.The cinematography is as well very good. Exteriors for the film were shot at Old Tucson Studios, just outside Tucson, Arizona. Filming took place in the summer of 1958, and the movie's credits give 1958 as the year of production, although the film would not be released until 1959.A curious fact about the film is the addition of two singers(Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson) for the important supporting roles in the film. They later do music just a few moments before the great climax of the film.So, yeah. Rio Bravo is really a very good film, and it's somewhat better than it's remake El Dorado. A good choice for a 500th film.8.7/10",

            "content": "Perhaps it is because westerns aren't really my thing but I just never really could get into this movie. It's long, mostly consists out of just talking back and forth and is lacking in adventure, action, true excitement and than some more.Guess you could still say that the movie is good, just not great. Even though it was lacking a lot, it wasn't a movie that I hated watching, simply because it's a far too well made one for that. Howard Hawks and John Wayne are obviously at ease within the genre, I just wished that the story had more to offer.It takes literally almost 90 minutes into this movie for the 'conflict' to finally develop but that doesn't mean that the movie takes off after that point. It's one that more puts its focus on its characters, rather than its story. That's fine of course, as long as the characters are interesting enough and the actors that play them are good in their roles. But no, John Wayne wasn't exactly the best actor that ever lived, which also shows in this movie and Ricky Nelson was also distractingly poor in his role. What the movie is further more lacking, when it comes down to its characters, is a good strong villain. Of course they still found room for a love-story to get thrown in, which just isn't something I'm waiting for when I'm going to see a western. It still is good and fun to see a young Angie Dickinson in this, as Wayne's, almost 30 years younger, love interest.Because the characters aren't really that compelling, the dialog of the movie also falls sort of flat. And the dialog is really something the movie its script had put its emphasis on. This is the foremost reason why the movie tends to feel a bit overlong and slow. I kept waiting for a good stand off or the moment that they got on their horses and ride off but it just wasn't that kind of western. So yes, maybe I was expecting a different movie but I was also certainly expecting a better one.Sorry to say but this movie just never surpassed the level of 'just good' for me.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Filmed by Howard Hawks as a response to what he saw as none macho cinema in Gary Cooper's acclaimed High Noon, Rio Bravo has moments of brilliance that are sadly coupled with failings that are not Hawksian peccadilloes. The macho plot is simple but wholly effective as our heavily out numbered heroes (John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan & Ricky Nelson) defend a jail house against a marauding mob trying to release an incarcerated friend. This alone sounds grand but the truth is, is that it takes the film nigh on close to 100 minutes to get to the adrenalin rush of the siege and even allowing for fine character development, the film is ponderous and even at times dangerously close to being self indulgent.The casting of Ricky Nelson was (as is widely regarded now) one of the worst of its kind in the history of cinema, he was there purely as a marketing ploy to garner the teen audience who were bopping to his pop tunes way back then. In fairness to Hawks, though, he saw straight away that this was out of Nelson's league and promptly (and cutely) gave him few lines of note to speak of. Also a big negative in the film is Angie Dickinson as the Female interest, she is raw and fresh out of water, and it shows, just like sushi on your plate.The bonuses with the film however keep the film talked about for ever more, Wayne is magnetic and believable, whilst Martin comes into his own as the drunk trying to do right, a superlative performance from him and one would think that is really down to Hawks' direction. The action sequences are of a high standard, while the tight intimate feel of the town is precious - and who can resist an ending that makes you want to go fire yer guns in the air?A very good film, but not a Western masterpiece by a long shot. 7/10",

It's two others that separate this movie from other Westerns, though.Pedro Gonzales-Gonzales, as Carlos the hotel-keeper, is a breath of fresh air.  His interplay with John Wayne's John T.

            "review_title": "The film was made as a response to High Noon",
            "content": "Rio Bravo is a 1959 American Western film directed by Howard Hawks and starring John Wayne, Dean Martin, and Ricky Nelson. The supporting cast includes Angie Dickinson, Walter Brennan, and Ward Bond. The script was written by Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett, based on a short story by B.H. McCampbell.In short, the film is about a small-town sheriff (John Wayne) in the American West enlisting the help of a cripple (Walter Brennan), a drunk (Dean Martin), and a young gunfighter (Ricky Nelson) in his efforts to hold in jail the brother (Claude Akins) of the local bad guy (John Russell).The film was made as a response to High Noon, which is sometimes thought to be an allegory for blacklisting in Hollywood, as well as a critique of McCarthyism. Wayne would later call High Noon \"un-American\" and say he did not regret helping run the writer, Carl Foreman, out of the country. Wayne teamed up with director Howard Hawks to tell the story his way. In Rio Bravo, Chance is surrounded by allies - a deputy recovering from alcoholism (Dude), a young untried gunfighter (Colorado), a limping \"crippled\" old man (Stumpy), a Mexican innkeeper (Carlos), his wife (Consuela), and an attractive young woman (Feathers) - and repeatedly turns down aid from anyone he doesn't think is capable of helping him, though in the final shootout they come to help him anyway. \"Who'll turn up next?\" Wayne asks amid the gunfire, to which Colorado replies: \"Maybe the girl with another flower pot.\"No matter where you stand on the political aspects of the film, it is a great example of both Hawks and Wayne doing what they do best. Hawks made some of the most entertaining films of the 1930s and 40s, including Only Angels Have Wings, Bringing Up Baby, and To Have And Have Not, and he had a style of his own that is often unappreciated for its simplicity. Never a fan of the close-up, he preferred shots where the relationships between the characters and the locations were highlighted. Rio Bravo shows us actors framed in windows or doorways, so we see them in a wider setting and build up our own sense of the geography of the small town - the saloon, the jailhouse, the long dark street that connects them. These shots establish the action so well; we know that there is nowhere to run when the showdown starts.\"Sorry don't get it done, Dude. That's the second time you hit me. Don't ever do it again.\"The characters are also a great strength of the film. John Wayne never looked particularly sexy, but Angie Dickinson works so hard as Feathers, the smitten love-interest, that you buy it. Wayne's character, John T Chance, looks poleaxed by her attentions, which gives him a charm that sometimes eluded him. There are other great performances, particularly from Dean Martin as Dude, the drunk who has to sober up, and Ricky Nelson as Colorado, the young gunslinger.StyleHawks was versatile as a director, filming comedies, dramas, gangster films, science fiction, film noir, and Westerns. Hawks's own functional definition of what constitutes a \"good movie\" is revealing of his no-nonsense style: \"Three great scenes, no bad ones.\" Hawks also defined a good director as \"someone who doesn't annoy you\".While Hawks was not sympathetic to feminism, he popularized the Hawksian woman archetype, which has been cited as a prototype of the post-feminist movement.Orson Welles in an interview with Peter Bogdanovich said of Howard Hawks in comparison to John Ford \"Hawks is great prose; Ford is poetry\".Despite Hawks work in a variety of Hollywood genres he still retained an independent sensibility. Film critic David Thomson wrote of Hawks in The New Biographical Dictionary of Film \"Far from being the meek purveyor of Hollywood forms, he always chose to turn them upside down, To Have and Have Not and The Big Sleep, ostensibly an adventure and a thriller, are really love stories. Rio Bravo, apparently a Western - everyone wears a cowboy hat - is a comedy conversation piece. The ostensible comedies are shot through with exposed emotions, with the subtlest views of the sex war, and with a wry acknowledgment of the incompatibility of men and women.\" As David Boxwell states \"It's a body of work that has been accused of ahistorical and adolescent escapism, but Hawks' fans rejoice in his oeuvre's remarkable avoidance of Hollywood's religiosity, bathos, flag-waving, and sentimentality.His directorial style and the use of natural, conversational dialogue in his films were cited a major influence on many noted filmmakers, including Robert Altman, John Carpenter, and Quentin Tarantino. His work is admired by many notable directors including Peter Bogdanovich, Martin Scorsese, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Michael Mann and Jacques Rivette.Although his work was not initially taken seriously by British critics of the Sight and Sound circle, he was venerated by French critics associated with Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma, who intellectualized his work in a way Hawks himself was moderately amused by, and he was also admired by more independent British writers such as Robin Wood. Wood named the Hawks-directed Rio Bravo as his top film of all time.",

This is only my third John Wayne film which I'm surprised by because I feel like I'm more familiar with him. The other two are The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance which I really like and The Searchers which is good but has its flaws. Its charms comes from its colourful and warm network of great characters. It has a lot of heart and I come to care from them all greatly and genuinely wish them no harm during inevitable danger. In particular, the tragic and heart-breaking-or-making Dean Martin, who's a pleasure to watch in every single scene he's in, especially in one in which he sings with Ricky Nelson.The witty script has a great dry sense of humour with every joke hitting the mark and making it an even more relaxed affair than it already is. There isn't much urgency in the plot, with a simple story stretching for 2 hours and 15 minutes, but it never feels too slow or rushed (despite this jarring with the ever-present possibility of death). It effortlessly weaves the compelling character drama within the narrative and it's a genuine pleasure to watch. The great cinematography and sets are the best pre-Sergio Leone era I've seen in a Western with a fantastic sepia colour theme but not completely saturated. Rio Bravo is pure cinematic bliss. A very pleasant and welcome surprise. As a sidenote, this is the third new favourite from 1959 I've seen so far this year. Good year.9/10",

They argue and spar throughout the movie, adding much comic relief to an otherwise conventional story.Joe Burnett is a powerful local rancher who kills an innocent bystander during a fight he provoked, and is arrested and taken to the town jail for it, where the sheriff and the deputized Dude and Stumpy hold him in wait for the marshal. They hold off the rancher's brother and his hired hands, while in the meantime an old friend of Chance comes to town with his group, as well as a woman named Feathers who is a card player and possible cheater. The questions are whether Chance and company can hold off the hired hands, and whether Dude can stay clean and competent as he withdraws from his alcoholism, and how good is Stumpy with his health problems anyway. Also what is the story with Colorado, the young man who came with the supply train, and will he get involved? Not until after watching the movie did I learn about this movie being a deliberate answer to \"High Noon\", where that sheriff kept going to the townspeople begging them for help, only they were too cowardly. Chance is different; he refuses outside help but gets it anyway. A more convincing scenario when you think about it.",

Walter Brennan returns in a familiar casting role -- cantankerous, backtalking, usual role -- so I found that regrettably boring as well, since Brennan's range of acting far outreaches that particular typecasting.

Frankly I can't understand how is it possible that most of them say this is a \"Masterpiece\" or \"Hawk's Best\" or \"Great Movie\" or \"Still One of the Best\" and a lot of similar opinions.The story is rather interesting and could have done a great movie, but it has so many terrible flaws that turns into a B western (and that being generous). Lets see:1) John Wayne is always John Wayne. He doesn't really act (except perhaps in his two best westerns \"Stagecoach\" and \"The Shootist\") both really good. 2) Sheriff John T. Chance looks always as if he knew the script is on his side and he'll come out well no matter what. 3) Ricky Nelson looks exactly like a comic magazine cowboy, totally out of place and surely someone told him about the happy ending too. And we also are forced to listen to his singing! 4) The movie is too long and with plenty of hard to believe sequences. 5) Most of all the final shooting that is really incredible and impossible. Wayne, Martin and Nelson engage in a shooting contest hitting small dynamite bars not only when static on the floor but moving rapidly through the air far from them. Wayne does it with a rifle (difficult enough) but Martin hits them with a six shooter without even aiming!! I can assure you also that dynamite bars don't blow off when hit by a bullet, a spark is always needed. The whole sequence is absolutely ridiculous, more proper of a \"spaghetti\" western and definitely sinks the film to the bottom.My 4 points rank for Rio Bravo comes out of acceptable setting and good performances by Angie Dickinson, Walter Brennan and Dean Martin (shortly after breaking his comedy partnership with Jerry Lewis). Fine music too. But that aside, nothing at all to match the great westerns of the 50's we enjoyed through the decade (High Noon, Shane, 3:10 to Yuma, Gunfight at OK Corral, The Gunfighter and so many others). In fact, I think Hawks himself realized the movie was really poor and spoiled, so he made \"El Dorado\" within a short period of time; though almost a remake of Rio Bravo and not a top western either El Dorado has not the terrible flaws and ridiculous sequences we saw in Rio Bravo and is a far better movie.Don't you agree?",

            "content": "Howard Hawks, smarting from the failure of Land of the Pharaohs, left for Europe for a few years to lick his wounds and consider his next moves as a film director. While in Europe, he discovered that television westerns with emphasis on character rather than plot were fairly popular, so he returned home to America. There he found John Wayne ready and willing to work on a counterargument to Fred Zinnemann's High Noon, the story of Gary Cooper's lone sheriff in a small western town who can't get anyone to help him get ready for the arrival of a known felon out for his blood. Wayne and Hawks were of the opinion that High Noon was simply wrong in its portrayal of the West and the hero, so they made the best counterargument possible, they made another movie.John T. Chance (Wayne) is the sheriff of a small Western town. His deputy, Dean Martin's Dude, is at the tail end of a two-year bender in response to a girl leaving him. In a great, silent opening scene, Dude is so desperate for a drink that when the notorious Joe Burdette, younger brother to the most powerful man in the area Nathan Burdette, throws a dollar piece into a spittoon Dude is reticent but willing to reach in for that dollar to get him his next drink. Chance saves him from the degradation in the final second, and Joe ends up attacking Chance and shooting another man dead. Chance and Dude get Joe into custody, and the standoff begins.What's markedly different about Rio Bravo is its almost lackadaisical pace. The plot gets sidelined for long stretches as Wayne, Martin, Angie Dickenson, and Walter Brennan play off of each other with the other assorted members of the town. Quentin Tarantino apparently showed this film to every woman he ever dated, and if they didn't like it then he ended the relationship. Looking at his filmography through the lens of Rio Bravo, it suddenly all makes sense. He's been making his own version of Rio Bravo in some capacity until Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood where it almost feels like a complete homage. This isn't a movie about its plot. This is a movie about its characters in the middle of a situation. This feels like a movie made from the moments cut out of most movies. Where most movies have their characters endlessly discuss the plot, these characters discuss it occasionally and then simply try to live their lives otherwise within the confines of the situation at hand.All of that rests on a handful of things. The first is the script. Hawks was well known for allowing his actors to improvise freely on set, but in order for that to really work you need to start with a strong script that provides a great guide on who these characters are. The second is the actors themselves. They have to fit their roles almost like archetypes, understanding what the script has created in their individual characters, allowing them that space to improvise but also the boundaries on how far they can go in any particular direction. The third is the world around them. This has to feel complete, populated, and real so that it never feels like the characters have been transported from the place of the plot to somewhere else where they can talk. They still need to inhabit the world completely and at all times.Rio Bravo does all three extremely well.The script and actors use the world to full effect. They feel alive as Chance and Dude interact with Walter Brennan's Stumpy, guarding Joe in the jail with an ever-present shotgun, ready to shoot Joe should anything start up. An old friend of Chance's, Pat Wheeler (Ward Bond) rides into a town with his wagon and men including the young Colorado (Ricky Nelson), a great gunman. Pat is immediately on Chance's side, offering whatever services he can to help, but Chance refuses it all. He doesn't want to endanger the lives of those not involved of their own choosing, including Colorado even though he could use the help for sure. Into the scene walks Angie Dickenson's Feathers. Arriving in Rio Bravo on the stage, she's stuck while the stage gets fixed. She takes up at the local card game, but Chance ends up suspecting her of being noted on a handbill, and when he discovers that three cards are missing from the deck, decides to take action. It ends up she isn't the one sleeving cards (her dress won't allow it), but she was married to a noted card cheat who died a few months back. It was another guy at the table, helped caught by Colorado, who was cheating.So sets in motion the string of character vignettes that come to make up Rio Bravo. We see how Chance and Stumpy are friends with constant bickering, almost like a married couple. We see Feathers steadily fall for the manly and brave Chance. We see Dude steadily find his sobriety in the face of danger, allowed his badge once again. We see Nathan show up to start showdown with Chance, but the situation Chance has created, waiting for the US Marshalls to arrive for Joe while holding Joe under guard, is too well maintained for any sort of rash action, allowing the whole character based story to play out comfortably but believably at the same time. Colorado becomes more and more useful until he gets too involved to deny official involvement anymore, Chance finally offering him a badge.The finale centers around Dude, and I just have to take a moment to talk about Dean Martin. Martin was a lounge singer who started as the second half of a duo with Jerry Lewis, breaking off to follow his own career. He sang in Vegas alongside his buddies in the Rat Pack, even starring in the original Ocean's 11 as pretty much himself. Here he plays the drunk, self-doubting Dude really well. In fact, there's so much of him that if Hawks had been forced to cut down the running time from two hours and twenty minutes to a hundred minutes, he would have had the choice of two main characters, Chance and Dude, to center the proposed shortened movie around.Dude ends up getting captured by Nathan with the intention of trading the deputy for Joe. This leads to a shootout with Stumpy throwing dynamite that Colorado, Chance, and Dude shoot at. It's a good, explosive ending, finding a way to provide genre thrills at the tail end of a movie that's largely more concerned with character interaction.I suppose if there's a problem I have with the movie, it's that John Wayne is so obviously so much older than Angie Dickenson that it ends up coloring their interactions in a weird way that reminded me of my reaction to John McTiernan's Medicine Man. I mean, I can believe that a young woman would fall for John T. Chance, especially in the face of the danger he's up against. He's a very manly example of the sex, and I could see the appeal. But the age difference is just so obvious that it becomes a small barrier for me.Anyway, this is Hawks returning from a failure (maybe not a complete artistic failure, but definitely a commercial and critical one) in grand form. He makes a statement about heroism from one of cinema's most defining heroic personalities, countering a film he considered unbelievable (Cooper walked out of Rio Bravo apparently thinking the same thing of Hawks' film), and making a great film overall. This is just good old-fashioned movie making.",

            "content": "Rio Bravo (1959)I saw this again because I just saw (and loved) the similar Howard Hawks movie, \"El Dorado.\" This earlier one is more famous and revered, and I can see why at first. \"Rio Bravo\" is archetypal. It's more serious and a little more gritty and violent than the later one. It's also extremely well done, a kind of paradigm for the good guy/bad guy Western. There are some humanizing factors here for this type of movie. John Wayne is his usual likable stern self but with a sense of humor. Dean Martin plays a (dirty) drunk in a way you can empathize with. And Ricky Nelson is mild and cute (and sort of dispensable). And then there is Angie Dickinson who has a kind of sculptural presence and comes off with pretty good ease as a young actress (she was a television actress all along, and later was a t.v. icon in \"Police Woman,\" a middling cop show in the 1970s). This movie is partly about relationships--friendships, budding romance, rivalries. And the overriding theme is one of sticking together against evil. The town is \"good\" and all of Sheriff John Wayne's friends are \"good.\" I put it in quotes because they represent good, as opposed to evil. Or at least to indifference, which is a deliberate counterpoint to Zinnemann's famous \"High Noon\" where the town will not help the sheriff. (John Wayne was angry about High Noon and wanted to do Rio Bravo partly to set the record straight about how decent people really will rise to help their sheriff in dire times.)The result is a surprisingly feel-good experience. The movie has its dark moments, but you learn quickly that our gang of good people (including, by the way, a cackling Walter Brennan) will prevail. So encounters might lose their chill and sinister edge, but they gain the power of winning. Maybe this is like Bruce Willis in the Die Hard movies, where you know, in his joking way, he'll succeed. So these jokers, who really like each other and who even take time to sing a couple songs as a group (John Wayne just watches), succeed.So is this a great movie? Yes, pretty much living up to its reputation. It is almost a final punctuation mark on two decades of Westerns (if we look at 1939 as the start, when four major A-list Westerns hit the screens after a terrible decade of trashy B-list versions). It sets the stage for the arch exaggerations like \"Fistful of Dollars\" and other Italian productions. And it sets the stage of Hawks's own \"remake\" of sorts, \"El Dorado.\" And for my money, I like the way El Dorado pushes the ideas a little harder--both into a kind of campy humor and into a true buddy relationship between the leads in that film. Here Dean Martin is always marginalized, even as he pulls of some life-saving feats.See them both. Check out the idea. Throw in High Noon and you'll have an idea of how the American Western was winding up some very prolific and profitable years.",

He embodies this genre. Tough but fair. Hard but gentle. Willing to kill, but not liking it. Rio Bravo has Wayne at the top of his game. He is ably aided by a strong supporting cast - Dean Martin as the drunken deputy (he can act!), Ricky Nelson as the young kid learning life lessons from Wayne. Angie Dickinson, though about half Wayne's age at the time of filming, as the love interest and good ol' Walter Brennan as the sidekick, Stumpy.Throw in Howard Hawks strong direction and this movie is what it is. A WESTERN where the good guys take on the bad. No middle ground, no grey area. Just good versus bad.And darn entertaining.9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",

It seemed like he was sleep-walking through most of them (Matt Helm, 5 Card Stud, Ocean's Eleven). But I must say I was really impressed with his performance in this picture. I couldn't get enough of his character, \"Dude\". Troubled, drunken,down and almost out, Martin gives a wonderful multi-layered performance, without overplaying it. I feel that he gives the best performance of this movie.That's not to say that John Wayne and Walter Brennan don't measure up, because they do. It's just that by the time Rio Bravo was made, they both had already accumulated many superb performances in other pictures.Angie Dickinson and Ricky Nelson are also good in roles that are not quite as interesting. And of course it's always good to see Ward Bond.Not one of my favorite westerns (I still prefer \"The Searchers\") but I like what Hawks does in contrasting his film from \"High Noon\". It is said that Hawks hated that film because he did not believe that a law man would desperately try to find people to back him up. He believed that a real lawman would behave the way John T. Chance did. I also liked how much of the film takes place in the jail. You really get the feeling that their ability to move about the town were limited.A good, solid western drama.

It's a classic Western film that strays from themes related to the genre. Instead of the stereotypical outlaw vs. sheriff theme, Rio Bravo forces the audience to analyze each character and how their unique backstories explain their actions.One of Rio Bravo's defining features is that, unlike other Westerns, there isn't an overwhelming protagonist. Instead, each of the characters are seen grappling with their own issues and finding their place in the story.All four of our main characters are deputies in the town. John Wayne plays the sheriff and acts as the calm and steady voice of reason in the story. Dean Martin plays Dude, a has-been who delved into alcoholism after he was left by a woman. There's Stumpy, the crippled grandpa and a young, talented new guy. The interactions between all the other characters is quite interesting, especially the chemistry between Chance and Dude.Methodically speaking, this is a really good movie whether you like Westerns or not. The writing is really good, and the direction especially is remarkable. Each scene is intricately set up. I want to bring special attention to the opening scene. There's no dialogue, and we don't fully find out what transpired until later. The opening scene really pulled me in, and set this up to be a really solid film.Unfortunately, the run-time is a bit long. As the movie progresses, Feathers and Stumpy started really annoying me. There's a shootout scene that's really good, but the closing scene is anticlimactic and I wish the movie had ended better for the sake of the story.Despite all the praise I can offer Rio Bravo, I just don't think it warrants over a 7 rating. The scenes with Feathers are too drawn out, and I think we'd have a better story if her character was removed completely. Nonetheless, this is definitely a good Western to see if you appreciate character development, dramas, and John Wayne.",

I ain't kiddin'! Like, how could this film ever get away with being so over-rated for all of these years? Everything about Rio Bravo was tired-tired-tired, including the 52 year-old John Wayne, who looked like he was about ready to nod off at any minute in this one.At 140 l-o-n-g minutes, I must say that Rio Bravo definitely pushed the limits when testing one's overall patience and tolerance. I believe that at least 30 minutes could've easily been cut from Rio Bravo's running time and no one would've noticed the diff, one way, or the other.Considering the so-called \"star-power\" that was jam-packed into Rio Bravo, you'd honestly think that this film would've just snapped, crackled, and popped with pure \"Western\"-style vitality and vibrancy. But, no, sadly enough, Rio Bravo was so tired and slow-paced that, at times, it got mighty close to falling flat on its face.The unusual thing about Rio Bravo was that (since 95% of its action took place indoors) it lacked an authentic, Western-type, outdoor adventure to hold the viewer's interest. This struck me as very odd and this was the main factor that contributed to Rio Bravo's tired and somewhat claustrophobic atmosphere.Naturally with Rio Bravo being the tired Western production that it was, it could only be expected to feature a tired romance, as well. Right? This tediously tiresome love affair took place between 2 people who were, quite obviously, 30 years apart in age. And because there was no on-screen chemistry, whatsoever, happening between these 2 actors (Wayne & Dickinson), the whole affair was just plain tired to the 10th power, going, pretty much, nowhere, fast.Rio Bravo's highlight (if you really wanna call it that) was the duet of sorts that was sung between Pop Idol, Ricky Nelson and Swooner-Crooner, Dean Martin. Needless to say, this particular rendition of the ballad \"My Rifle, My Bow and Me\", which was effortlessly sung by these 2 singers was very much like the rest of Rio Bravo - T-I-R-E-D!Zzzzzzzzzzzzz....

This story is a simple setup -- the secondary plot line is similarly simple: Deano wants to stop drinking. Oh, and there's a love story of sorts. The pacing is a grind, with every turn predictable. There aren't even any shots of the west here, the whole thing was filmed on a back lot.None of what I have mentioned is any better than hundreds of Warner Brothers \u009160s TeeVee episodes. That this is on the IMDB best films list is a scandal; an absolute embarrassment even though Brennan CAN act.What's interesting in this film is the appearance of Ricky Nelson. He would soon become Rick and become a leader (with Graham Parsons) of the western rock movement, which is now the repetitive tripe called `country.' Graham would die in a couple years from drugs, and the same drugs would grind Rick down slowly until his plane accident.What's of interest here is that you can witness firsthand what may be one of the great tipping points in music history. Black music was coming to be kid's music soon -- the Elvis explosion was just beginning. The other indigenous American music was just being artificially split between `folk' which the peacelove crowd would adopt, and this music here. It was first adopted by faux rednecks (like Wayne) and later a mainstream. Both threads were hillbilly music.Film westerns by this time had had several decades of singing cowboys, but it was Rick's genius (actually Ozzie's) to link western music to POPULAR music, which then meant kid music. Check out the hair. Check out the passing of the torch from Deano to Rick to both serve the galoot Sheriff (surrogate for the public). Check out the name: `Colorado.'

This film serves as his response to High Noon, and it's not only vastly inferior to Fred Zinnemann's classic but also bloated, boring & bog-standard.Directed by Howard Hawks, the basic premise is more or less the same except this one is unnecessarily stretched. The supporting characters are far more interesting than the lead, but the endless conversations between them and the repetitive set of events that unfold over the course of its 141 mins runtime only end up making the ride all the more tedious. It is predictable and it is formulaic.John Wayne does his usual shtick and, as often is the case, chips in with a bland & colourless performance in an otherwise bright-coloured film. Dean Martin & Ricky Nelson contribute with good inputs and a purposeless mid-film sing-along. Angie Dickinson's character is the only one who piqued my curiosity. And though Walter Brennan is amusing at first, his grumpy act becomes annoying real soon.Overall, Rio Bravo has its share of occasionally thrilling moments but considering its reputation, it is a surprisingly mediocre western feature that's slow, frustrating & needlessly overlong. And when compared to the gripping intensity & sustained tension of High Noon, it is rather laughable.

I like this movie for what it is, but those who call it a classic western or put it in the same league as High Noon are sorely mistaken. Rio Bravo is essentially the Rat Pack out west but with the Duke filling in for Frank. The Duke is never really in danger or seriously hurt. Okay, he trips down the stairs. The movie lacks a compelling villain since Claude Akins (pre- Movin On) is in jail most of the time. Ed Asner & Chris George were a great pair in ElD. Rickie Nelson as the youngest Rat gets to sing a few tunes and keep his hair puffed. He looks about old enough to shave. Dean Martin isn't bad but can't touch Robert Mitchum's performance in El Dorado. I love Walter Brennan and he's great moanin & groanin and rantin & ravin. Put him and Arthur Hunicutt (Bull from El Dorado) in a cell together and that would be something. There is lot's of sexual tension here provided by Angie Dickinson, but I'm sorry I don't believe she'd radiate it for a guy that old. The Maudie character played by Charline Holt was a more credible and still sensual mate for the Duke. I give the nod to James Caan as Mississippi over the younger Rickie Nelson - Colorado.If this was Hawks'/Waynes answer to High Noon than it's a weak reply. High Noon is a serious black & white look at a town's abandonment of it's sheriff who is in mortal danger. He's saddled with a wife and torn between staying and leaving. There's not a second of comedy in High Noon. John T Chance (Wayne) is a Lucky Chance with everybody he meets offering to help. This is not Western reality its Hollywood.

I liked the way Hawks kept the story within the confines of the town, not bothering to soak up the magnificent scenery so beloved of Ford and Mann.Russell Harlan's fine camera-work serves to increase the tension throughout (Harlan did To Kill a Mockingbird, Witness for the Prosecution and many more fine pictures). The performances are excellent. Many have said Dean Martin has never been better--he outdoes himself here, makes me reflect on how good he was in Some Came Running. Angie Dickinson gives a tremendous performance as Feathers; she seems assured for much of the time, yet there is an underlying insecurity. We keep waiting for her to get on the stagecoach and she never does. Walter Brennan gives a lovely impression of Dogberry from Much Ado About Nothing--endearing confusion. John Wayne is still handsome at 52, and carries himself with that assurance we knew so well. His acting skills were never the point. If Ricky Nelson is hardly a great actor, he is a capable one.

            "content": "John T Chance captures the psychotic brother of a wealthy and corrupt cattle ranger and locks him in the town jail after he killed a man in cold blood. However with almost a week until the US Marshals arrive in the town, Chance is forced to try and hold out against the constant but subtle pressure. Unwillingly he enlists help from the most unlikeliest of places \u0096 a drunk, an old man, an unwilling boy and a woman who seems to have fallen for his western charms.In the top 100 lists of many critics you'll find this western.  I know that there must be some link to the politics of High Noon as this appears to be too similar in theme to that film to have no connection.  However I'm not sure of the politics behind it and to be honest didn't give it a great deal of thought while I was watching it.  The plot is the same for the whole film, the stand off starts 5 minutes in and doesn't stop until the end.  The pressure is not constant and the film could be seen as lacking in action as it mostly is a silent stand off.  However I liked the way this worked as it created a tension that was well serviced throughout.The film feels sow the odd time but it actually goes quite quickly.  The script is witty and clever and every scene keeps the interest quite easily. Even the traditionally weakest strand to the film (the romantic sub plot) is used well and adds a little fizz to the film (mainly thanks to a really feisty and sexy performance from Dickinson, desperately trying to get John T's attention in any way she can).  The action is pretty good although sparse but the film is better when the action is threatened rather than executed.Wayne is easy in this film and he carries himself very well with charm and witty touches to his performance.  Martin steals the acting award by doing something other than mugging (which he does do too often in other films). His character is believable without being too serious and he carries some scenes himself.  As I have said Dickinson was excellent and pitch perfect, while the support cast in all their guises do well (despite the stereotypical `evil land owner' \u0096 in fairness the stereotype was born in these films, not enforced in them).Overall this may feel a little slow but it is a very enjoyable western.  The script is sparky and amusing while the use of dark streets and interiors help build the tension over the whole film.  Good performances and likeable characters also help and make for a western that is well rounded and enjoyable.",

            "content": "Rio Bravo is a movie that has been gushed over by numerous critics (Roger Ebert's review is particularly unctuous). Frankly, I don't really get it. I thought it was a really good movie and gave it 6 out of 10 in IMDb, which is a good score for me. It also scored well in my ranking system with 14 points, but for my money it doesn't belong in the conversation of \"best Western of all time\". Here's what I liked: Obviously, Hawks is a great director. He's at his best here at the interplay between the characters, especially Chance and Dude. Stumpy and his relationship to everyone is well drawn also, as are Feathers and Colorado. You've got to like the names of all the characters too, right? Chance, Dude, Stumpy, Feathers, Colorado. Great stuff. Really cool use of the haunting trumpet in the Mexican \"Cutthroat Song\", which Burdette orders the band to play in order to harass Chance. One of Wayne's better roles, which is saying a lot. Dean Martin is fantastic in this. There's an interesting story about how Hawks cast Martin, if you can dig it up. Scored well in my Mexico/Indian/Civil War category with the well characterized Mexican hotel owners who come to Chance's aid. Also, town was well populated with Mexican characters, which was historically accurate. Good use of comic relief. Claude Akins was an effective heavy, although his brother, played by John Russell, could have been characterized a little better. Look for Russell as the henchman Stockburn in \"Pale Rider\" 25 years later. Nothing about his movie was really bad, I just have some minor complaints: I found Ricky Nelson very awkward in this. Too bad they couldn't get Elvis. That would have been really interesting. Once again the stunning age difference between Wayne and Dickinson undermined the romantic subplot. Nice effort by Dickinson, though. Could they have left that town set for just one minute? I guess claustrophobia was part of the theme. I hate claustrophobia Songs by Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson were horrible Does a stick of dynamite automatically explode when hit with a bullet? Not the best shootout at the end and the body count seemed a little on the high side.",

It's just another one of those that I throw into my \"I don't get it\" file, especially given the high rating here at IMDb. Director Hawks was a master of the obvious. His films rarely have any surprises and this is no exception. You know as soon as you see \"Directed by Howard Hawks\" during the credits that every good guy will survive the story. You know John Wayne's character is in about as much danger of not making it as, say, James Bond in a 007 flick.Because of the lack of surprises, the story lacks any punch and is just another tepid bit of fluffy entertainment from the Howard Hawks mold...and he sure did like that mold. It's hard to keep this Western separate in my mind from \"El Dorado\" and \"Rio Lobo,\" as they all follow the same formulaic character ensemble story. Heck, it's hard to separate this in my mind from \"Hatari.\"A couple of \"Dont's\" and \"Dos\": DON'T expect: anything subtle or nuanced, nice cinematography, in-depth character development or absorbing storyline. DO expect: hammy, over-the-top wooden acting, a complete lack of clever dialog, obvious plot lines, typical stage lighting and studio back lot sets.It's occurs to me that \"Rio Bravo\" is to Westerns what \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad Mad World\" is to comedies, and if that kind of broad and obvious treatment is your cup of sarsaparilla then you will no doubt savor this one.",

It can be and has been transposed to just about any era, anywhere in the world. Next, the story is absurdly simple. You have a small group standing off a much larger group trying to get their comrade out of captivity. That's about it. There isn't a whole lot more. Finally, the actors camp it up something terrible. Now I don't hold with those who say John Wayne couldn't act. If you watch \"Red River\", \"The Searchers\", \"The Quiet Man\", \"True Grit\", \"Hondo\", and a number of others, you'll find an impressive body of work by a dedicated professional. Here, however, Wayne plays Wayne and nobody else. The same is true of just about everyone else in the cast with the exception of the great Walter Brennan, who brings dignity to his role. I am aware that many people really love this movie. I am aware that \"Rio Bravo\" is included in some critics' top ten lists of the best Westerns ever made.

            "content": "So this was supposed to be the \u0084real\" spirit of the West as opposed to the one shown in High Noon? A fashion conscious sheriff who wears a red shirt on one day and a blue one the next (who does his laundry?). A drunkard and an old geezer as his helpers. A \u0084funny\" stereotype Mexican couple who run a hotel. A dance hall girl who has sort of a crush on the sheriff. A saloon keeper. And lots and lots of firearms and ammo. In the beginning there are quite a few people on the streets, later the town seems to be deserted except for the afore mentioned persons plus an unspecified amount of hired gunmen out to free an imprisoned murderer.Where did all the people of the little town go? They just disappear without any trace. My guess is that there was much more gun action than shown on screen and that many a good citizen succumbed under the \u0084friendly fire\" of the forces of the law. John Wayne and his companions are nervous and extremely trigger happy, the sheriff's plan to hold out alone and wait for the Marshall to pass through the town does not seem to be dictated by common sense (there would have been alternatives) but by personal pride. There is no interaction whatsoever between him and the community he is supposed to serve. Frankly, the sheriff seems to be a pretty irresponsible guy with the mind of an adolescent \u0096 and responsibility was the main theme of High Noon, a film, it must be said, of a different league.On the whole I find Rio Bravo an unconvincing movie. The main protagonists have to deliver long, winding, unnatural monologues as to their motives and feelings, which makes the movie also slow at times. This surplus of talk unfortunately does not give it or its message more substance but harms it suspensewise. Amidst the general mediocrity, the brilliant performance of Dean Martin as the alcoholic who wants to regain his standing among men stands out. The same can be said for the use of music which is beautiful and fitting.I am a great admirer of John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13, a low budget movie reportedly based on Rio Bravo. I count it to my all time favorites. Amazingly, Carpenter's version of the story works far better, is more convincing (also in a moral sense), more gripping and on the whole more intelligent than the \u0084original\".",

Some little things don't always make sense or gel, but there are no glaring plot holes. Don't just a shoot-em-up western, there is character development too, especially in the case of Dean Martin's character, and even some romance, though this is dealt with a touch superficially.Good action scenes, as you would expect from Howard Hawks and John Wayne.John Wayne is his usual cool, swaggering, albeit one-dimensional self. Probably the best performance comes from Dean Martin, as his character has the most depth, and demons.As if one singer in the cast wasn't enough, we have Ricky Nelson too. Wasn't expecting much from him, but he is fine in his role as the Colorado kid.Having Martin and Nelson in the movie means the producers are obliged to have a musical interlude. It is fairly gratuitous, but I didn't mind it. Good music, well played and sung.Angie Dickinson provides the love interest, and does so very well.Only blemishes are two of the supporting cast: Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez as Carlos and Walter Brennan as Stumpy. You'd swear Gonzalez-Gonzalez's performance inspired the character of Manuel in Fawlty Towers. So clumsy and stereotypical it is irritating. At least Manuel was funny.Walter Brennan's Stumpy talks far too much and complains far too much, about nothing. Very irritating. Hawks should have dialed him down a bit. A classic western.",

My main interest in seeing RIO BRAVO is that it served as a big inspiration on John Carpenter's ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, and as a massive fan of Carpenter I knew I had to watch it. Having just watched it, I can report that it's an involved and engaging western, one with flaws but which overcomes these by offering strong action scenes and good characterisation. The similarities to the Carpenter film are fewer than expected, as this doesn't have any of the siege action I was expecting.The plot sees Wayne and his buddies holding a notorious criminal in their town jail while the guy's gang members and brother attempt to free him. There's little more to it than that, and it's a decent template for thrills and action. The shoot-outs in this film are well directed and exciting, and the large scale climax approaches brilliance. However, the film does drag in places with the overlong running time. Angie Dickinson is an arresting presence for sure, but her romance scenes with Wayne feel unnecessary (not to mention unbelievable). Dean Martin lends solid support as the drunken aide, but that whole sub-plot of him getting drunk and taken advantage of feels a bit redundant too.

            "content": "A thoroughly enjoyable Western, directed by Howard Hawks and featuring John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan, and Ricky Nelson. Hawks was at his best here. Everything in the film is strictly utilitarian. The camera shoots only from eye level. The set design, props, and wardrobe are perfunctory, sort of generically \"western.\" Hawks doesn't reach for anything beyond the immediate pleasure of watching what's on the screen. No messages, except maybe that friends have to stick together and that pride doesn't goeth before a fall but rather is an intrinsically admirable quality.Hawks takes a boyish delight in having his characters display a kind of boy-scout level ingenuity. You want to knock Sheriff John Wayne out? You simply string a line across the bottom of the staircase, have a woman scream, and when Wayne comes rushing down the stairs he trips over the line and is knocked conveniently out. Maybe you want to have two people communicate with one another without revealing their presence. You have them creep around and whistle to one another like bird imitators. This device is used not only out of doors (at night) but inside a big hotel. It might be argued that big hotels don't have birds in their hallways but who cares? The film rarely deals seriously with any of its elements. Yes, Dean Martin is a recovering alcoholic (barely) and there is occasional genuine friction between him and Wayne, and of course there is the question of seeing justice done, but it's all handled rather lightly. The problems are all overwhelmed by the humor that Hawks and screenwriter Furthman have laid on. Gonzales-Gonzales contributes mightily to the amusement quotient. When Wayne learns that Angie Dickinson, who has the hots for him, has stayed up all night to protect him, he tells Gonzales-Gonzales, \"Well, you can . . . tell her for me that . . . the fool.\" Gonzales-Gonzales: \"Jew want me to tell her that sheece a fool?\" Wayne: \"What? No! I'll tell her myself.\" Gonzalez-Gonzalez: \"Jew are going to tell her that sheece a fool?\" It isn't that funny in print but the way the two actors play this scene is exquisite.Props are there mainly to provide little details of interest, some important and some not, but they wouldn't be there in the first place if they weren't going to be used. A black hat. A set of six shooters. A potted plant.The inevitable climactic shoot out dissolves into outright mischief. The good guys have the bad guys penned up in a warehouse and practically squealing with joy they bombard the building with sticks of dynamite, seeing who can throw farthest or most accurately. Everybody joins in the fun and a good time is had by all, including the viewer.Hawks decided to make \"Rio Bravo\" after watching \"High Noon,\" a story about a sheriff who goes around town asking for help and gets none. \"High Noon\" is sometimes interpreted as a metaphor for the McCarthy witch hunts. Anyone accused of having been a communist was automatically alienated from the community and deserted by his friends. Hawks was disgusted by the message, as undoubtedly John Wayne and, especially, Ward Bond were. \"Rio Bravo\" was designed to serve as a riposte to the earlier film, but none of that shows on the screen. What we see on the screen are a crew and cast that seem to be having enormous fun.",

            "content": "For me this movie glistens with the reflected magic of movies. It might not be a Western to everyone's liking because it isn't strictly speaking \"realistic\" in every aspect, but it presents basically a complete package of entertainment with action, comedy, characterization, and even singing.The story is a pretty simple affair, with John T. Chance (John Wayne) arresting a murderer (Claude Akins) whose brother (John Russell) happens to be a big wheel in this frontier town. As he sits and waits for the Federal Marshall to appear to take the murderer away, everyone in town offers their help but he doesn't want any (\"we'd just be giving them more targets to shoot at\"), in a reversal of \"High Noon\". His only companions early on are an \"old cripple\" (Walter Brennan) and his recovering alcoholic friend \"Dude\" (Dean Martin). After Chance's friend Pat (Ward Bond) is killed by the brother's hired killers, they are joined by Pat's friend who they name \"Colorado\" (Ricky Nelson). Then he begins to fall for a lady of somewhat questionable repute, a possible criminal gambler who he names \"Feathers\" (Angie Dickinson). The nicknames are typical of the movie's excellent style of characterization and also its macho aesthetic -- which interestingly is extended to the very aggressive woman Feathers.One of the film's better aspects is the way in which it avoids overt symbolism, allegory, and is generally speaking anti-epic in its style and goals. The movie isn't about \"how the West was won\" or \"how the West was lost\" or any other such topic.... it's really more of a war/combat story about how men are able to rise above their problems by staying true to each others' friendship and by respecting each other even to the point where you would hurt your friend in order to tell him the truth.The film's style of characterization is not subtle, but it is effective. The very first scene is a good example -- Dude walks into the bar where Burdette (Akins) and his friends are carousing and the camera lingers on the liquor bottle while we see Dude smacking his lips. Burdette laughs and tosses a coin into the spittoon, and Dude begins to fish the coin out of the filthy tobacco receptacle but is interrupted by Chance, who the camera did not observe entering the room. This scene lets us know that Dude is an alcoholic and that Chance cares about him, while others mock him. All of these elements are important throughout the film.I'm very impressed with the way the romance between Chance and Feathers was worked out. It bears comparison to another Brackett/Furthman screenplay, \"To Have and Have Not\". But it's even more amped up here, with Feathers for instance insisting on a strip search while the embarrassed Sheriff Chance hems and haws. This is really the only film I've seen where Wayne was used convincingly as a lover. The screenwriters and Hawks deserve only part of the credit -- I would credit Wayne for being willing to underplay and let Angie steal a lot of scenes, and certainly Dickinson shows the kind of fire that makes you wonder why she didn't become a huge star. This is one of the best aspects of the film.All the supporting cast is excellent as well. Martin really surprises for anyone who is only acquainted with his comedy work -- he does a good job of showing both his torture and self-loathing and the gradual path to self-respect. Brennan, always a delight, is here especially fun as a sort of Gabby Hayes-esquire malcontent coot. Nelson is perhaps the weakest of the 3 principals but he doesn't look completely bad, just a bit too smooth and casual compared to the amped up performances given by the others.Not to be missed by fans of classic movies.",

            "content": "John Wayne detested HIGH NOON and Howard Hawks thought even less of it, the sight of Sheriff Gary Cooper humbling himself by asking cowardly townspeople for help against a vicious outlaw seems to have deeply offended their concept of who and what constituted a hero in a Hollywood western. So like good Americans, they didn't just bitch and complain, they made their own movie and told the story their way, the result being RIO BRAVO, and the big winners were us movie buffs and western fanatics.The plot of RIO BRAVO is simplicity itself: Sheriff John T. Chance locks up brutal outlaw Joe Burdette (Claude Akins) on a murder charge and awaits the arrival of the Marshall in a few days. Nathan Burdette (John Russell), Joe' wealthy rancher brother, hires a gang of killers with the intention of freeing his brother, at the same time making sure the good citizens of Rio Bravo get the message that if they try to come to Chance's aid, it won't be pretty. Wayne's John T. Chance is a true professional, who does not bemoan his fate or beg for help, he stands for the rule of law and won't be intimidated, going about his job calmly and without without any outward fear. But the script (co-authored by Leigh Brackett) makes it very clear that as good as John T Chance. is, he does need help in this tight spot and gets from a most unlikely group: Walter Brennan's crippled old deputy, Stumpy; Ricky Nelson's young gunfighter, Colorado; Angie Dickinson's dance hall girl, Feathers; Pedro Gonzales Gonzales's hotel operator, Carlos; and most significantly, from Chance's alcoholic deputy, Dude, played by Dean Martin in what is surely his finest hour. This typical rag tag band of misfits come together for a common good, and prevail over the villains by being loyal to each other and exhibiting competence in a crisis, thus earning the respect of Chance and the esteem of the others. Courage is defined not as the absence of fear, but as the willingness to confront danger in spite of it. All of these are some of Hawks's favorite themes, thus making RIO BRAVO intensely personal while at the same time, deliberately commercial. There are great touches of humor and lots of great dialog, while each scene appears to be laid out with great care, especially the famous wordless opening in a saloon; the positioning of the actors, the laying out of the sets (mostly the dusty streets, the town's hotel and the jail) appear to have been done with an eye that knew how to tell a story visually. Few reviewers note how well the night time scenes are done.John T. Chance is probably the finest realization of a John Wayne hero in any film, a compliment from Chance is the highest honor a man could receive, and I think Wayne smiles more in this movie than any other, often at the antics of Brennan, in the kind of role he played better than any other. Martin's performance as Dude, a role originally offered to Montgomery Clift (who worked with Wayne, Brennan, and Hawks in RED RIVER), is a revelation; nothing much tops the scene where he pours the whiskey back in the bottle when the band starts to play the \"cutthroat\" song, which Santa Anna used in an attempt to frighten the defenders of the Alamo. Angie Dickinson's Feathers (with her stunning legs on display) has to give the sexiest performance of any of Wayne's leading ladies, we even get inside her bedroom, a rarity for westerns at the time. Many think Ricky Nelson was out of his depth in this movie and was cast only for box office appeal, but I think he more than holds his own. RIO BRAVO is the last pairing of old pals and frequent co-stars Wayne and Ward Bond.At two and a half hours, RIO BRAVO moves along very leisurely by modern standards; maybe Hawks should have copied HIGH NOON's tight pacing.In the end, I think HIGH NOON told us much about contemporary America and the degradation and corruption of civilization; while in RIO BRAVO, Wayne and Hawks give us the heroic myth of the Old West at its finest. Both films are equally valid in what they say and are enduring classics in their own right. Want to see how relevant RIO BRAVO is, go see GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY.",

Angie Dickinson is radiant and razor-sharp as Feathers, a cunning but warmhearted lady drifter (Wayne & Dickinson's scenes are absolutely priceless).  Ricky Nelson is instantly likable as the fresh-faced but streetwise Colorado (I LOVE that name!).  And, of course, Walter Brennan steals the show in a film made up of show-stealing performances as the infinitely cantankerous and chatty Stumpy.There's lots of great action and comedy here, but the part that had the deepest impact on me was the singing scene.  For some reason, it just really hit home for me--Martin and Nelson's soulful crooning, Stumpy's harmonica, and the Duke hanging back with a small, genuine smile on his face; all of them realizing that they may not live out the night, but thinking to themselves that life will have been worth it nonetheless.  It was that rare gem of a cinematic scene that feels completely real--where the emotions of the characters and the audience become one.  After watching it, you feel as if you were actually in that cramped, stuffy little jailhouse, whiling away the hours with these unlikely friends.  It was during this scene that I really felt what director Howard Hawks was getting at.\"Rio Bravo\" is a thoroughly enjoyable and at times touching watch--even for someone (like me) who's not the biggest fan of the Duke, the Rat Pack, or teen idol actors (Nelson).",

            "content": "The number of Westerns that Hollywood has made is mind boggling. I hate to think how many there have been. And, Westerns have suffered because of that. Just about everything you could do in a Western has been done over and over again, of course with variations, but I guess you could say that there's nothing new under the desert sun.So, to be considered one of the very best Westerns ever made is quite a compliment. But what is it that makes this Western truly special. There's nothing new here. Just about every thing in this film had been done in some other Western. But here, all those various elements come together in one film. The sheriff in trouble; nothing new. A boozy cowboy; nothing new. A hot shot young gunfighter' nothing new. A Gabby Hayes like sidekick; certainly nothing new. A seemingly floozy woman gambler; nothing new. A bully who thinks he can control everything and everyone; nothing new. A bully; nothing new. A shootout; nothing new. Ac crusader; nothing new there. And, most importantly, the camaraderie; nothing new there, either. Most Westerns are lucky to have a few such elements, but in \"Rio Bravo\", all those elements and many others come together perfectly.The opening scenes of the film are considered by many to be brilliant. NO DIALOG as the drunk (Dean Martin) walks into a saloon, and is seemingly offered a drink by the bully (Claude Akins), who throws a coin into a spittoon. The drunk is beginning to reach into the spittoon when it is kicked away by a towering man (John Wayne). The drunk reacts by clobbering the sheriff with a piece of firewood. The bully laughs, and is in turn attacked by the drunk. The drunk is beaten. A bystander steps in and is hot to death. The bleeding sheriff follows the bully to another saloon. Nearly 4 minutes later, finally some dialog. But that opening sequence sets the stage (so to speak) for all that is to come.A second brilliant set of scenes takes place again in a saloon after Ward Bond's character is shot to death. The assassin apparently runs into the saloon, but then disappears. Dude (Dean) wants to go in the front door for a change, so Change (Wayne) goes in the back. But no bad guy. Dude orders a drink, and then just a few drops of blood drips down from the loft above into a mug of beer. Absolutely fantastic scene.When it comes right down to it, the pivotal character in this film is Dude, played by Dean Martin. Almost everything in the film revolves around the drunk's redemption. Even Wayne once noted it. Dean's character here, however, isn't just a drunk. He coming off of a drunk and having withdrawal symptoms. A commendable performance, and an indication of what Dean was capable of...when he summoned up his ambition to really act.Another strength here is a strong supporting cast. Ricky Nelson does quite well in a very laid-back role as a sharpshooter. Angie Dickinson -- never one of my favorites -- does nicely here as slightly disreputable woman who ends up with...well, you know. And, by the way, John Wayne was often rather clumsy in romantic scenes, but here he plays well off of Angie Dickinson. And of course, special commendation to Walter Brennan -- always great -- for one of his very best film performances. And there's also Ward Bond, a character actor that I have always felt was highly underrated. For comic relief there's Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez as the hotel keeper. Gonzalez-Gonzalez made an interesting splash in show business about this time -- first noticed for a visit to Groucho Marx's \"You Bet Your Life\".Some have made much about the \"singing segment\". As illogical as it is, it works. Dean's performance of \"My Rifle, My Pony, And Me\" is one of Dean's finest vocal performances. And, it advances the story.Of course, there's got to be real shootout, and the shoot out in \"Rio Bravo\" is a humdinger and rather unique. Dude is kidnapped after a foiled jailbreak, add in dynamite at an old warehouse, mix in Wayne, Deal, and Nelson, and you've the recipe for an explosive...yet fun...conclusion. And then there's the concluding scene..,implying that Wayne and Feathers are having sex...but it's done in a clever and humorous way.A perfect picture? Well, no, but then again how many films are...probably none. I can't find anything here to criticize, but lots to praise.Well, actually I do have one criticism, but it's not about the film. It's about the Blu-Ray disc from Warner Brothers. It's not up to what we have come to expect from Blu-Ray. That's not to say it's a bad print, but it's also not top-notch.",

            "content": "One professional critic referred to Howard Hawks' \"Rio Bravo\" as a \"super Western.\" Released in 1959, John Wayne plays Sheriff John T. Chance of Rio Bravo with three deputies: Dude (Dean Martin), who struggles with alcoholism the whole story, the cackling Stumpy (Walter Brennan) and, later, the youthful Colorado (Ricky Nelson). They try to stave off a rich rancher (John Russell) and his hired heavies who are intent on freeing the rancher's murderous brother from jail (Claude Akins). Angie Dickinson plays Feathers, a gambling saloon girl who develops a things for the Sheriff.\"Rio Bravo\" was Hawks & Wayne's response to \"High Noon\", the popular Western released 7 years earlier. They rejected the cowardly depiction of a town of Westerners toward 4 outlaws out to kill the ex-Sheriff. It's hard to believe that any townspeople in the real Old West would have turned yella when faced with just 4 gunmen. These were tough folks, after all, who had faced Indians, wild animals, bad weather etc. to get to the West and were as familiar with guns as we are with cell phones. Many were Civil War veterans.A good example is the James-Younger gang, who were shot to ribbons in Northfield, Minnesota, when the townspeople got word that their bank was being robbed. Same thing happened to the Dalton Gang in Coffeyville Kansas. Both of these gangs were far larger than the 4 gunmen of \"High Noon.\" Since banks were not insured by the FDIC in those days, depositors were very nervous about unauthorized \"withdrawals\" by outlaw scum.Is \"Rio Bravo\" really a \"Super-Western,\" as that aforementioned critic called it? No. A classic perhaps, but certainly not a \"Super-Western.\" It struck me as a Western soap opera more than anything else, which isn't a bad thing, as I enjoy dramas now and then, but this is hardly an action-packed Western. There are four confrontations/gunfights in the first two hours before the final showdown; other than that it's all soap operatics. Which, again, isn't necessarily a bad thing; I just think it's important for potential viewers to realize that \"Rio Bravo\" is not an action film. It's a dialogue-driven drama with a few gunfights.\"Rio Bravo\" was shot in Old Tuscon, Arizona, and the studios of Burbank. Despite the former this is a fairly studio-bound Western, but it does successfully create the world of Rio Bravo where the viewer spends 2 hours and 21 minutes. \"Rio Bravo\" has a unique vibe. It's almost weird, like you're entering into this surreal Old West world, which I guess explains its cult status. Since the film has a strange ambiance it helps if you mentally prepare to watch it. It also helps to use the subtitles so you can keep track of the interminable discourses since this is such a dialogue-driven picture. For instance, the first time I watched \"Rio Bravo\" (in the early 2000s) I failed to fully appreciate it because I missed a lot of the talk. Using the subtitles really helped me appreciate the movie more.Hawks made two other Westerns with Wayne that bear similarities to \"Rio Bravo\" -- \"El Dorado\" in 1967 and \"Rio Lobo\" in 1970 -- but these are far from remakes, as some claim, especially the latter (only the second half of \"El Dorado\" takes the \"Rio Bravo\" route). They're all of about the same quality so, whether you prefer one or the other depends on what you want. I like \"El Dorado\" best, followed by maybe \"Rio Lobo,\" perhaps because they're less dated and far less soap opera-ee. Yet I've come to appreciate \"Rio Bravo.\"Angie Dickinson is a highlight. She was 28 during filming and beautiful, particularly in her stunning closing scenes, but you have to wait well over two hours to get there. One critic panned the romantic subplot between Feathers and Chance, but I found it compelling in a low-key, heartwarming way. If anything was going to be cut to shorten the runtime it should be the song sequence at the Sheriff's office with Martin and Nelson, but it has its old-fashioned charm, so I'm glad it's there. Speaking of music, the \"El Deg\u00fcello\" piece by Dimitri Tiomkin is outstanding. FINAL WORD: If you brace yourself for entering the unique world of \"Rio Bravo\" this is a solid character-driven 50's Western characterized by the camaraderie of the protagonists and grace under pressure. It's largely an Old West drama limited to the confines of the town of Rio Bravo, i.e. Old Tucson (I guess that's why they called it \"Rio Bravo\", huh?).GRADE: B-",

Too much has been written about him as a Rat-Packer sycophant.

            "review_title": "Perfection",
            "content": "This film is perfection.I hesitate in calling it the \"greatest western of all time\", as so many defining elements of the genre are lacking (for one thing, all the action takes place within city limits \u0096 so much for horse riding across western landscapes). More importantly, it transcends genre barriers and stands in a world of its own. A world of pure and simple correspondence between ends and means of the film-making process, that is, of classic perfection.As many have noted, the starting point is simple: a sheriff needs to keep an outlaw in custody, other outlaws try to spring him. The ease and grace with which Hawks creates a two-hour long narrative from this, both elaborate and always radiantly clear, at the same time fast-paced and seemingly immobile, would be overwhelming if the result were not of such classic evidence.This he does by perfectly balancing the characters, whose common point is the need for redemption or fulfillment, whether they are too old (Stumpy), too weak (Dude), too young (Colorado) or even too desirable (Feathers). Sheriff Chance is both unwilling to relate to them and unable to do without them \u0096 thus conferring a constant ambiguity to his behavior, balancing between pardon and anger, an ambiguity instantly redeemed by the righteousness and the physical grace with which he moves among them \u0096 \"Sorry don't get it done, Dude\" must be my favorite quote from any movie.The same balance can be found between the few action scenes and the more gentle episodes. The action is scarce, but then all the more intense as it comes both inevitably and at unexpected moments. It is climactic and beautifully shot and choreographed. There are few gunshots (excepting the ending), but always to the point (if not always on target). To illustrate this, let us examine the episode in which Dude shoots an outlaw he and Chance are pursuing. He is unsure of whether he has hit him: this uncertainty is at once transmitted to his whole character, and to a characteristically sceptical as well as sympathetic Chance. In this sense, not a shot is wasted, as they define so powerfully the essence of characters and relations between them. The same could be said of young Colorado's ascension, materialized through his gun fighting ability. This is a classic feature of westerns, brought to unseen heights by Hawks.These action scenes contrast beautifully with three other kind of scenes: the romantic seduction scenes in which Angie Dickinson shines; the comedy scenes taking place in the hotel, and the alternately anguishing and joyful scenes in the prison \u0096 culminating, as a reviewer has noted, in the songs shared by Dude, Stumpy, Colorado and an appreciative and silent Chance, a blissful moment in which time, the plot, the suspense are cast aside and all is left is an exceptional complicity between the characters, the director and the spectator.Many defects can be found here and there, yet as a whole, the movie is perfect, as it creates with seemingly effortless grace a world \u0096 complete with strong and weak characters, a sense of time and space, right and wrong, necessity and chance (not a meaningless name for Wayne's character) \u0096 we at once recognize and love as our own.",

            "content": "Howard Hawks''Rio Bravo' is a film so simple in appearance and execution that contemporary critics tended to brush it off as just another 'John Wayne Western', a charge they also leveled against John Ford's 'The Searchers'. In both cases, the critics misjudged films that captured the directors' talents at the apex of their careers. Certainly, no film could better be defined as 'A Howard Hawks Film' than this magnificent western!While Hawks worked in a wide variety of genres, the core of his films most often revolved around the camaraderie of friends to fulfill difficult, if not impossible tasks. This sense of loyalty and devotion made him the 'father' of what we call, today, 'buddy pictures'. The idea that a man might be deserted by those closest to him at a time of need was unconceivable, which prompted him to speak out against 'High Noon', with it's 'Man Alone' theme. His attitude was shared by John Wayne, who once called 'High Noon' the worst film his friend, Gary Cooper, ever made! Together, the pair decided to create a film that would tell a similar story on THEIR terms; the hero, here, hasn't a shortage of allies, but too MANY who are willing to risk their lives!In putting together 'Rio Bravo', Hawks reunited 'Red River' stars Wayne and Walter Brennan, and composer Dimitri Tiomkin (Legend has it that Hawks and writer Leigh Brackett originally wrote the part of drunken deputy Dude with Montgomery Clift, from 'Red River', in mind; unfortunately, Clift, whose life and career had crumbled following his near-fatal car accident, was unavailable, and Dean Martin stepped in, giving one of the finest performances of his career). Beautiful, tough, feisty females were always a staple of Hawks' films, and Angie Dickinson continued the tradition, verbally challenging Wayne repeatedly, until he finally acknowledged, by film's end, that he loved her (in a most unexpected way!) Rounding out the cast were veteran actor Ward Bond, as the 'Sacrificial Lamb', another Hawks' staple, and TV and musical star Ricky Nelson, complete with a 50's Pompadour hairdo and an acting style that could most kindly be called 'wooden', as a young stud gunslinger, to attract teenagers to the film.As with all of Hawks' best work, relationships are given equal status with the plot, and each character has ample opportunity to shine in his role, while bonding with the others. A film highlight is a cozy scene in the jailhouse, where, as Wayne smiles on approvingly, Martin and Nelson warble a couple of tunes, with 'Stumpy' Brennan accompanying them on a harmonica. In the hands of a lesser director, scenes like this would seem an unnecessary distraction from the story; in Hawks' skilled hands, we hate to see the scene end!There is so much to like about this film that whole essays have been devoted to it, and it's importance, not only as quintessential Howard Hawks, but as one of the finest westerns ever made. Hawks, himself, was so pleased with the results that he 'remade' the 'Rio Bravo' story twice more, with Wayne; first, as 'El Dorado' (with Robert Mitchum taking the Martin role), then as 'Rio Lobo'.If you want to see one of the screen's greatest stars and a legendary director at 'the top of their game', or you'd just like to kick back with a classic western, complete with rip-roaring action, comedy, romance, and even a bit of toe-tapping music tossed in, look no further...'Rio Bravo' is for you!",

            "content": "They say that the best way to make a comment about a movie is to make a film of your own as a form of rebuttal. Both actor John Wayne and director Howard Hawks were not fans of the classic HIGH NOON: Wayne (who had been offered the part of Will Kane) felt that the movie was an un-American portrayal of the Old West while Hawks simply felt that Kane was a wimp for asking for help from the very people he was assigned to protect. That dislike led to the making of RIO BRAVO. Is it better than HIGH NOON? I don't think so, but it's still a good movie.RIO BRAVO stars Wayne as sheriff John T. Chance, who always totes his trusty Winchester rifle (because he doesn't feel as confident with a six-shooter). At the opening of the movie, Chance and his drunken deputy, Dude (Dean Martin), are bringing in outlaw Joe Burdette (Claude Akins). After Burdette's arrest, his brother, Nathan (John Russell), brings in his gang to bust him out by any means necessary. Meanwhile, cattleman Pat Wheeler (Ward Bond) comes into town and hears about Chance's problems. He offers his men as help, Chance refuses, feeling that they'd be no match for the professional guns hired by Burdette. However, when Wheeler is killed, one of his men, Colorado (Ricky Nelson), decides to help out Chance. It ends up being Chance, Dude (nicknamed \"Borachon\", Spanish for \"the drunken one), the gimpy Stumpy (the irrepressible Walter Brennan) and Colorado against the killers of the Burdette gang.Also thrown into this mix Feathers (Angie Dickinson), the woman who just may have sent Dude on a drinking spree. She's not a femme fatale but she is also no damsel-in-distress neither as she makes romantic overtures towards Chance. This leads Dude into getting captured by Burdette and sets things up for a big showdown that ends with a bang in more ways than one.The best performance in the movie, hands down, goes to Martin, who sort of dirty ups his \"lovable drunk\" image here. Nelson does well too as a fast draw. However, as comparisons to HIGH NOON come up, I find this film lacking: in the former film, the hero asks for help, doesn't get it and ends up standing alone. Here, the hero is offered help, refuses, but gets help nonetheless. The villains here aren't exactly given much screen time and what they have isn't utilized well. I had no idea why the Burdettes were supposed to be such bad men. The shootouts in both films are good for different reasons; HN's is more suspenseful while RB's is pure action. The women in both films are good, again, both for different reasons. I still like HIGH NOON more, but RIO BRAVO isn't a bad way to spend a night if you're in the mood for a good Western.",

In 1952, \"High Noon,\" one of the greatest--if not the greatest--westerns ever made was a smash hit. A brilliant story, told in real time, of a man of uncommon integrity and valor, \"High Noon\" is, by any measure, a classic, made by several people who were blacklisted by cowards of the John Wayne ilk. So, instead of a story of a man of high principles, called by circumstance, to stand on them, we're given a tale of a lawman, surrounded and assisted by buddies. Especially awful is the not very subtle misogyny which mars Howard Hawks' version: \"High Noon\" presents several strong-minded, mature women; Rio Bravo offers a quivering, quaking mess, who calls herself an \"idiot,\" mysteriously falling in love with the aging, hulking Duke. In \"High Noon,\" the May-December romance is explained by having been preceded by lengthy correspondence and they do have their troubles. But Angie Dickinson simply melts merely at the first sight of John Wayne. Hollywood powerhouses from Harry Cohn to Harvey Weinstein have needed to feel that they are irresistible to young women: indeed, Howard Hawks married Dee Hartford, when he was 56 and she was 24. In \"Rio Bravo,\" Angie Dickinson--a Dee Hartford look-alike--at 27, swoons at the first sight of John Wayne, aged 51. This must be a popular yarn for the moguls of Hollywood, but it's not so plausible for most moviegoers. Most of the actors are very professional, but tepid \"teen idol\" Ricky Nelson sticks out like a sore thumb. Walter Brennan is cast as the obligatory cantankerous codger \"sidekick,\" a role which Gabby Hayes pioneered so well. There's no shortage of corn in a Howard Hawks western, but the cowboy crooning is greatly inferior to veteran cowboy singer/actor Tex Ritter in \"High Noon.\" When you have nothing to say, it's easy to say nothing: the flat staging and setups are nothing compared to Fred Zinnemann's and Floyd Crosby's excellent craftsmanship. Ironically, Hawks' and Wayne's opinion that Will Kane in \"High Noon\" would not have been betrayed by the good folks of Hadleyville is challenged by history: according to Jeff Guinn's fine book, \"The Last Gunfight,\" Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday stood trial for murder following the gunfight at the OK Corral. So \"High Noon\" makes more sense than Howard Hawks' schmaltz. Sadly, this picture is pivotal in film history and criticism.",

Everything goes according to formula, but it's so well scripted, acted and directed that whenever it appears on our beloved TCM, I cannot stop watching until the movie is finished. It appears as though all the lead actors were having a great time going through their paces, and the result is an incredibly joyful experience for a movie lover. Ricky Nelson, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan, all at the top of their games. John Wayne really has never been better. This movie is just so well-crafted, that anyone that doesn't embrace it as one of the best examples of the Western genre, is just not getting into the spirit of the great American Western. And please tell me who was ever sexier than Angie Dickinson in her role as \"Feathers.\" Really one of the greatest movies of all time!",

            "content": "Eleven years after Red River(1948), John Wayne and Howard Hawks would team up again to do Rio Bravo(1959).  Rio Bravo(1959) is an action packed and entertaining film that never ceases to be boring.  Rio Bravo is about a lawman and his deputies who are traped in their town by outlaw friends of a murderer.  The opening scene gives a wonderful introduction to the characters of Dean Martin and John Wayne.\nThe film has a good story with its share of good guys and bad guys.  The dialogue is what carries this movie along.  The best scene of the movie is when Dean Martin walks into a bar saloon full of hired hands and outlaws to introgate them on the whereabouts of the man who killed the sheriff's friend.  The gunfight during the climax is both exciting and humorous.\nThe romantic angle between Angie Dickinson's Feathers and John T. Chance has a humorous edge to it.  Their relationship is a repeat of the one in To Have & Have Not(1944).  Feathers says about the same things that Bacall said in that flick.  John T. Chance and Feathers seems to enjoy getting on each other's nerve.\nRio Bravo(1959) would provide the main source of inspiration for John Carpenter's Assault on Preceint 13(1976).  It is beloved by famous filmmakers John Carpenter and Quentin Tarantino.  It is one of the most influential westerns of all time.  The Saloon sequence foreshadows the great bar room introgations of The French Connection(1971) and 48 Hours(1982).\nJohn Wayne does a terrific job in doing a parody of his film persona.  Dean Martin provides some pathos in his best role ever.  Walter Brennan gives some comic relief as the eccentric deputy, Stumpy.  Ricky Nelson comes close to being the weak link of the cast and his performance is nowhere near as good as James Caan who did a much better job in a similar role for El Dorado(1968).\nThe music of the picture is played serious with spurts of humourous tones in some parts of the movie.  The song sung by Dean Martin sounds similar to the theme music of Red River(1948).  Its when the music of the Alamo starts playing that Dude becomes fully sober.  Ricky Nelson does a good job in the film when it comes to playing the guitar and singing.\nThe main theme of Rio Bravo is male comradiare.  No matter what obsticles lie in their path, the four lawmen manage to stick together.  There is a strong bond between the main four that is as unbreakable as that of the outlaws in The Wild Bunch(1969).  Male bonding is another famous trademark of director Howard Hawks.\nThe direction is done with professionalism.  This maybe Howard Hawks most accessible film in his career.  His great films are, 1.The Big Sleep(1946), 2.Scarface(1931), 3.His Girl Friday(1940), 4.Red River(1948), and 5.Sergeant York(1941).  The action scenes are some of the best sequences done by Howard Hawks.\nThe art design of the film wonderfully captures the feel of the Old West. The story is well written by Leigh Brackett.  Rio Bravo(1959) was made as a result of Howard Hawks and John Wayne's dislike of High Noon(1952).  This was because the Marshal played by Gary Cooper was asking for help from people who refused to give him any and this was considered by John Wayne as unmanly.\nRio Bravo(1959) is a terrific Western with a good sense of humor.  It would be redone twice by Howard Hawks into El Dorado(1968), and his final film Rio Lobo(1971).  The musical score by Dimitri Tiomkin is one of his best.  My five favorite Howard Hawks features are 1.Rio Bravo(1959), 2.To Have & Have Not(1944), 3.The Big Sleep(1946), 4.El Dorado(1968), and 5.Ball of Fire(1941).",

After visiting Old Tucson Studios I decided to watch a trilogy of movies made there: The Three Amigos, Tombstone and Rio Bravo. The preserved movie sets have more of the flavor of the first (and more recent) two, but the surrounding mountains, the blue sky and the forlorn desert are the same for all. If you're a movie fan and visiting Tucson, I'd recommend seeing this.I have some reservations about recommending Rio Bravo, though. As Americana, as a campy experience, OK, but not as a great movie. Who wrote this thing? It seemed for a while like it could have been the Grateful Dead, but they didn't come into existence for several years after it was made. Dean Martin and Walter Brennan (aka Stumpy) are great, in a substance-abused sort of way - particularly WB's incoherent cackling and babbling. But the rest of the cast appears to be sleepwalking their way through what measures out at a little over 2-1/2 hours length. With some cutting - let's just say this could have been a lot better. But Angie Dickinson is a bit too random, and John Wayne a bit too wooden to make this great.",

Walter Brennan, who was even more racist than Wayne, overacts and Dean Martin was too lightweight as the drunken deputy. Angie Dickinson gives a typically weak performance, while Ricky Nelson couldn't act at all and gets the fewest possible lines for a third billed star. The two songs were completely out of place. For a good intelligent liberal masterpiece watch High Noon. For a dated badly acted reactionary piece of crap, watch Rio Bravo.0/10.",

This was one of his more relaxed roles, but the scenes where he has to take the rifle and belt someone with it sure do work too.Rick Nelson was okay but obviously there to yank in his fans. Kinda sticks out like a sore thumb. He tries but isn't anything great. As a shootist, he's not exactly persuasive.Deano I liked. He was vulnerable, troubled, flawed, a good performance. Robert Mitchum in El Dorado was about the same but such a malevolent big man himself, you don't quite worry about his state of mind as you do Dean's here. The 50 buck piece in the spittoon, Walter Brennan in the jail, the dynamite, and a good nasty perf. by Claude Akins-almost John Waynes size by the way-help push this one across.

Basically Sheriff John T. Chance (John Wayne) in a small town of Southwest Texas must keep custody of murderer Joe Burdette (Claude Akins) whose brother, powerful rancher Nathan Burdette (John Russell) is trying to help him escape. After a friend is killed, Chance gets new deputies, a disgraced drunk, Dude (singer Dean Martin), a young gunslinger, Colorado Ryan (singer Ricky Nelson) and an old cripple, Stumpy (Walter Brennan), and they must hold out against Burdette's hired guns till the marshal arrives. Meanwhile, the only subplot worth mentioning is Chance and his relationship with mysterious beauty Feathers (Angie Dickinson). Also starring Ward Bond as Pat Wheeler, Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez as Carlos Robante and Estelita Rodriguez as Consuela Robante. Wayne is very good, Brennan is fantastic with that accent, and when the story actually sees some action it is very fun to watch. It may not be the most sophisticated and high action western (in my opinion), it may be quite simple, but it is a good western all the same. John Wayne was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 13 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men. Very good!",

            "content": "The name John Wayne immediately conjures up images of the wild west much like the name Alfred Hitchcock conjures notions of suspense. Starting on the silver screen at nineteen, John Wayne still holds the American record for the most lead roles (142) in a career spanning into the seventies. Plainspoken, strong-willed and more than willing to take a tumble or two, John Wayne's name still stands the test of time; a name ubiquitous even today.Rio Bravo begins in near total silence. Local sheriff and former gunslinger the Dude (Martin) tries to pay for a drink at the local watering hole. Already drunk and out of money, local miscreant Joe Burdette tries to roughs him up. In the chaos Marshall John T. Chance (Wayne) tries to intervene but is punched in the jaw by the Dude who's trying to save face. A man is killed and Joe is arrested by the sore Chance and the still drunk Dude. In order to bring Joe to justice, Chance must team up with the Dude, Colorado Ryan (Nelson), a young gunslinger; local codger Stumpy (Brennan), and a travelling gambler named Feathers (Dickinson). In the shadows lurks Joe's older brother Nathan (Russell) who comes to town with a posse set on freeing his brother and killing anyone who tries to stop them.Much like Arthur Miller's \"The Crucible\" and On the Waterfront (1954), The story of Rio Bravo was written as a response to High Noon (1952). Famed for being the western for people who hate westerns, High Noon is regarded as an allegory to Hollywood's reaction to the House Un-American Activities Committee's red- baiting. Wayne at the time, was president of the Motion Picture Alliance and set out to make a counterpoint to Gary Cooper's Marshal Kane. Sheriff Chance doesn't ask for help from the townsfolk despite overwhelming odds. In-fact at several points he refuses help from anyone he doesn't feel would be useful in a fight. He's practical and duty-bound as opposed to wry and moralistic.Each important player, comes into the film with something to prove to the world. Dean Martin's career as a nightclub crooner was on the wane and while his third billing in The Young Lions (1958) was well received, nothing thus far compared to his partnership with Jerry Lewis. Looking to become a \"serious\" actor, Martin ended the partnership tumultuously in 1956. Meanwhile the eighteen-year-old Ricky Nelson was hot off the billboard charts and was given the role of Colorado only after Elvis Presley dropped out. Ricky symbolized the coming era of rock & roll to some of the old timers; an attitude that was not lost on him when Wayne and Martin threw him in a pile of steer manure on-set as a \"right of passage\". Then there was The Duke, who had not had a surefire hit since Hondo (1953). He dabbled in a few war films since then as well as a few historically misguided films, The Conqueror (1956) being the most loathsome. He also made what's widely considered his greatest accomplishment The Searchers (1956), a film not well received during its time but has since been ranked as one of the best westerns ever.Director Howard Hawks was also trying to get out of a downward spiral since his sword-and-sandal epic Land of the Pharaohs (1955) epically tanked at the box office. The famed studio director, dubbed The Silver Fox for managing to ferret his way into every Hollywood genre met his Waterloo. After a few years living in Europe, Hawks was ready to return to the director's chair and decided on Rio Bravo's beautiful script as his comeback. To hedge his bets Hawk's had his sets built 7/8ths to scale to make the actors and characters appear larger than life; not that the 6'3'' Wayne ever needed help with that.At two hours and twenty one minutes, Rio Bravo feels much more episodic than El Dorado (1966) or Rio Lobo (1970) (two films with identical conceits, said to be indirect remakes). The story also feels stronger, grittier and more universal. Those not intimidated by the film's near-mythic status and are itching to see multiple talents reaching for redemption, you'd do well to watch Rio Bravo.",

It's not all tobacco chewing, gun slinging, cattle rustling and burlesque ladies. There is a story to it and while it is a bit long, at no point did I feel that it had paused anywhere too long to make it drag out deliberately or for \"Artistic Effect\". I think a large part of that was building the tension for the eventual and obvious shoot-out that had to finish the film. It certainly had a good pace.The characters are all well rounded and well played and actually I think Dean Martin gave one of his best and most natural performances.\nI also loved Walter Brennan who, although it was often quite hard to understand him, did provide some comic relief.\nIt could perhaps have done without Angie Dickinson, as a love interest really wasn't crucial and she was a tad over the top in places.\nAs for \"The Duke\", I cannot watch any of his films without seeing and thinking of my Grandad who would get so invested in these films that my Nan always said that it was like he was riding the horses with them. Having also read a few bits of the IMDB trivia it seems like he was a very interesting character in real life too, just like Gramps Mont.Although it is a rough and tough and old skool masculine film, it's soft and gentle in its presentation, so that you could almost watch with most generations, mostly because the younger ones would be on their iPads, but more because it isn't in your face with blood and death and unnecessary cussing.It may have scored higher if it was from a genre I had more of an interest in.",

Dean Martin's character Dude is an addict, just like Christopher Moltisanti. And John Wayne's Sheriff Chance is in the same position as Tony. Because he loves the guy, and wants to trust him. But he's a man in a dangerous profession, and he's painfully aware of what a big risk it is.Watching this movie is really poignant, but even more so if you've seen the last few seasons of the Sopranos. In Season Four, we don't yet know what Christopher's fate will be. But I understand now why Tony loves this movie so much. Tony is just as tough as Sheriff Chance. But Sheriff Chance is surrounded by people who will never let him down, no matter how weak or silly they may seem to be on the surface. Tony is surrounded by people who will always let him down, no matter how tough or loyal they may pretend to be.And there's one more point to make. The movie as a whole is all about teamwork and loyalty, but Dino's song, \"My Rifle, My Pony, And Me,\" is all about going it alone. That's the part Tony is watching. That's the part he can relate to. Because sooner or later every man who's truly tough, who's truly a leader, has to go forward alone. And Tony gets that.The shoe fits!",

            "content": "\"Red River\" director Howard Hawks and his leading man John Wayne made \"Rio Bravo\" (1959) as a rebuttal to \"From Here to Eternity\" director Fred Zinnemann's \"High Noon\" (1952) with Gary Cooper. Hawks and Wayne hated \"High Noon\" because veteran town marshal Will Kane (Gary Cooper) lost his nerve in a crisis when a quartet of hardcase gunslingers arrived in town to kill him. Kane's regular deputy quit on him and Kane resorted in desperation to citizen deputies to help him stop a revenge-driven villain that Kane had sent to prison. Hawks and Wayne contended that the professional \"High Noon\" lawman should have stood his ground alone. At the last minute, Will Kane's Quaker wife came to his rescue. Wayne didn't like the ending where Kane tossed his badge in the dust. Quoting the Wayne biography by Randy Roberts and James Olson, the Duke said, \"It's the most un-American thing I've ever seen in my whole life. The last thing in the picture is old Coop putting the United States marshal's badge under his foot and stepping on it.\" Hawks puts his \"Rio Bravo\" protagonists in a similar crisis. Town sheriff John T. Chance (John Wayne) must confront an angry rancher and his army of trigger-happy gunmen after he arrests the rancher's younger brother for murdering an unarmed man during a saloon brawl. The primary theme of professionals versus amateurs pervaded Howard Hawks' movies and the highest tribute that any Hawksian hero or villain could pay to each another is that they were 'good' at their job. Unlike the weak-kneed \"High Noon\" hero, the heroic \"Rio Bravo\" lawman maintains his poise under pressure despite insuperable odds.After the disastrous box-office reception of his 1956 Biblical epic \"Land of the Pharaohs,\" Howard Hawks went into a self-imposed, four-year exile in Europe. Hawks made his comeback with \"Rio Bravo\" and assembled a stellar cast including Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, Walter Brennan and Angie Dickinson in a thoroughly ordinary but often suspenseful oater about a fearless lawman who has to hold a killer, Joe Burdette (Claude Atkins of \"Return of the Seven\"), in jail until the deputy marshal shows up in six days to take him. Predictably, Nathan Burdette (John Russell of \"Unforgiven\") isn't about to let Chance turn his brother over to the sheriff. A recovering alcoholic deputy, Dude (Dean Martin in his first dramatic role), and an old, crippled jailer, Stumpy (Walter Brennan of \"Sergeant York\"), stand alongside Chance. When one of Chance's loud-mouthed friends, Pat Wheeler (Ward Bond of \"The Searchers\"), tries to convince citizens to help Chance, Burdette's men ambush him in the street. Dude wounds the killer in the foot and Chance and he track him into a saloon where the patrons say they saw nobody enter. Meanwhile, the Wheeler's killer stands in the rafter dripping blood into a whiskey glass and Dude spots the blood and guns the felon down. Wheeler's ex-bodyguard Colorado (teen singing sensation Ricky Nelson of \"The Ozzie & Harriet Show\") joins them after rescuing Chance in a street shoot-out. A lady gambler, Feathers (Angie Dickinson of \"China Gate\"), complicates matters in a romantic subplot. Eventually, Burdette's gang abducts Dude and arranges an exchange for Joe. The resourceful heroes thwart Burdette's plans to free Joe and kill Dude in an explosive finale. The entire picture looks like a metaphor for the Cold War and specifically the eve of the Berlin airlift about the Soviets \"bottled up\" the Allies and let nothing get into the city.The critics and the public hailed \"Rio Bravo\" as a superlative western, and Hawks was back on top again. Later, Hawks recycled material from the Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett garrulous screenplay and made \"El Dorado\" (1966) and \"Rio Lobo\" (1970) with Wayne who finds himself in a similar predicament facing long odds. Despite its popular and critical reception at the time of its release, \"Rio Bravo\" is far from being a classic western. Hawks himself has said in interviews that he detested dull pictures where the heroes stood around and palavered. Essentially, for most of its indulgent 140 minutes, the sympathetic \"Rio Bravo\" heroes stand around a jabber with several comic interludes involving a Hispanic innkeeper Carlos (Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez) over peripheral matters. The subplot about Feathers is clearly material that Hawks used in his first Humphrey Bogart & Lauren Bacall thriller \"To Have and Have Not,\" but Wayne and Dickinson don't generate the same chemistry. The \"Rio Bravo\" heroes never seem like they are in jeopardy. They have time to argue and sing songs. Meanwhile, Burdette's bad guys lurk on the fringes. Aside from a miscast Ricky Nelson, who resembles Mickey Mouse with a pair of pistols, the cast qualifies as first-rate.\"Rio Bravo\" boasts many entertaining scenes and the Furthman & Brackett screenplay does an admirable job of setting up situations at the outset that they pay off at the showdown. Apart from its title credits scene, \"Rio Bravo\" emerges as a claustrophobic western that confines itself to the environs of the town with no wide open spaces. Academy Award winning \"High Noon\" actor Gary Cooper wasn't impressed and called \"Rio Bravo\" phony. Nevertheless, this memorable Hawks movie has acquired a reputation among many genre aficionados as one of the top ten westerns. Ironically, although its title refers to the famous river the separates Texas from Mexico, none of the \"Rio Bravo\" action takes place anywhere near it. Incidentally, there are three close-ups in \"Rio Bravo.\" The first one is Joe pulling his six-gun and firing it. The second is the blood dripping into the whiskey glass on the bar. The third is Dude's fingers trying to shape a cigarette out of tobacco and papers. \"Rio Bravo\" is a good western, but John Sturges' \"Last Train from Gun Hill\" with Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn tops it for drama, suspense, and action.",

            "content": "\"Rio Bravo\" is Director Howard Hawks' reaction to \"High Noon\".  In the 1953 Academy Award winner Gary Cooper spends the first half of the movie trying to recruit help to fight four baddies.  Ultimately, he faces them alone.Hawks believed that Cooper's Marshal should never have expected help.  His Marshal (played by John Wayne) makes it clear from the beginning that he doesn't need help from \"well-meaning amateurs\".  He does get some help from a young gunman named Colorado (played by Rickie Nelson), but Colorado is a professional.The cast does a good job with the excellent script.  Angie Dickinson has a particularly strong part as John Wayne's romantic interest.  She plays her role with understated humor.  \"Whoever heard of a stagecoach with a bathtub?\", she asks in response to Wayne's question about why she isn't on the stage.  In another scene she helps Wayne by throwing a flower pot through a window.There is a strong supporting cast.  Wayne's helpers include Dean Martin and Walter Brennan.  Ward Bond is on board briefly in the early scenes of the movie.  John Russell does an adequate job as bad guy Nathan Burdett.Ricky Nelson's performance as Colorado is a disappointment.  This is one of the strongest parts in the movie and he blows it.  His performance is wooden and stands out as one of this film's few weaknesses.The pace of this film is leisurely. The tense buildup paced by Dimitri Tiomkin's music and the clock in \"High Noon\" is not there. Instead, the increase in tension is interspersed with light moments.  In one scene Martin takes a bath while Wayne and Dickinson chat outside.  Music plays an important part in pacing this film.  Dimitri Tiomkin scored this film, too. His \"Deguello\" underlines the increasing tension.  Colorado describes the tune as a \"Mexican song I heard further south.  The Mexicans played it for those boys at the Alamo\", he says.  The implication is clear.  There will be no quarter for Wayne and his companions.  In another scene the music helps define one of the film's lighter moments as Martin and Nelson sing.  The tune is familiar.  It is the title theme from \"Red River\" with lyrics.This Western worked so well that Director Hawks felt compelled to do it twice more.  \"El Dorado\" is a not very subtle copy of this film, and \"Rio Lobo\" borrows from it as well.\"Rio Bravo\" is a pleasure to watch because of its good cast, script and pacing.  This is an outstanding production and Howard Hawks has seldom been better.  There is real chemistry at work here.  \"Rio Bravo\" is a landmark in Western films.",

Which is not a surprise, since nearly all the cast and crew involved here in RIO BRAVO were REAL CRAVO witch-hunting bullies or their cowardly craven enablers, and NOT right-thinking Americans such as Gary Cooper's U.S. Constitution-loving really brave sheriff in HIGH NOON. John Wayne's RIO BRAVO character is once again named \"John,\" probably because \"Il Duce\" had a few too many grid-iron concussions at Southern Cal. This gave him more trouble remembering to answer to a third name (layered on top of his childhood handle \"Marion\" and his studio flunky tag \"John\") than any other actor in cinema history. Why else are there nearly 100 movie credits in Mr. Wayne's IMDb filmography where his characters are named either \"John\" or \"Hey, you!\"? Though \"Feathers\" (teenager Angie Dickinson) parrots teen Lauren Bacall after kissing John a second time on-screen here (\"It's better when TWO people do it\"), RIO BRAVO cannot even rise to the level of second-rate Bogart, such as the lame TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT flick in which director Howard Hawks goes on his scavenger's hunt. (And Ms. Dickinson was too sharp to follow Ms. Bacall's Real Life lead in breaking up a Real Life marriage and saddling herself with a geezer for the rest of his Real Life, despite Mr. Hawks attempts to play a Real Life Cupid again.) John, as \"John,\" references THE ALAMO here, a mendacious vanity project then in the planning stages that would temporarily bankrupt Il Duce a few years after RIO BRAVO was released. When talking about RIO BRAVO composer Dimitri Tiomkin's fake version of the Mexican Army's \"No quarter\" Deguello dirge foreshadowing the eventual fate of Texas Race War Terrorists Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie, William Travis, and their ilk, the RIO BRAVO characters never explain that the reason for the heroic Mexican Freedom Fighters taking such an understandable dislike to the self-proclaimed \"Texicans\" was that the latter bunch of lazy racists were Hell-bent upon Re-enslaving all of the Free Black People of Mexico's Texas Province!",

            "content": "Not only is \"Rio Bravo\" one of the greatest Westerns ever, but it's about the most fun you'll have watching one too. For that, you'll have to credit an eclectic casting decision matching Dean Martin as a drunken deputy with the Duke himself, and nineteen year old teenage heartthrob Ricky Nelson as a sharp shooting gunslinger who throws in with the good guys. Round it out with Walter Brennan's finely tuned stereotypical turn as a real McCoy deputy sheriff and you've got the ingredients for an entertaining Western. And oh yes, I don't want to forget Angie Dickinson as the romantic interest for Sheriff John T. Chance (John Wayne), but at twenty eight, she didn't look like the kind of girl who'd go for the fifty two year old Duke, looking more like ten years older. I think if you play the picture in your head without her, you'd still have a decent outcome, even if someone else had to throw the flowerpot.Say, could you have picked two better Western character actors than Claude Akins and Myron Healey to challenge the Dude (Dean Martin) with the old coin in the spittoon trick? You know, they weren't on screen very long, but if you follow the genre as a fan, it's always a kick to pick out the players in even the most minor roles. Then there's John Russell, someone I'll always remember first as the \"Lawman\", but for some weird reason, I think I like him better as a villain. Trouble is, his screen time here wasn't nearly long enough to establish a sinister presence like the role of regulator Stockburn in Clint Eastwood's \"Pale Rider\" a couple of decades later. Still, I'll take him in a heartbeat if it means facing down the guys in white hats.The only thing that really catches you off guard in the story is when the good guys are holed up at the jail, and Dino breaks into song accompanied by Rick Nelson on guitar. Roy Rogers used to do that a lot too, even when he was behind bars! It's a nice diversion even if not very believable, especially when Stumpy (Brennan) knows the words to the song too! I guess what makes the picture work above all is the way Chance stays behind his guys through thick and thin, even when it looks like he's throwing them over. Especially effective are the scenes with Stumpy, played for comic effect, but always with some introspection and wise advice laid in between the lines. On the surface, it's not the kind of team you'd select if you were choosing sides for a pick up game, but when the dust settles, it's the one you'll have the most fun with and still win the contest.",

Unfortunately, the killer's brother is a rich man with dozens of hired guns, and Chance's only friends are Dude, a drunken hasbeen deputy, Stumpy, a gimpy old man, Colorado, a greenhorn kid, and Feathers, a big-hearted card sharp. The siege is on ...In terms of excitement, drama, interesting characters and classical film-making, this may well be the best western ever made. Why is it so good ? Because the three key elements of any movie - the direction, the writing and the acting, are all top notch. The script, by Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett, is a terrific yarn but more importantly a great drama with five intriguing characters, any of whom are interesting enough to have a movie all of their own. Chance is the leader everyone looks up to, Dude is a broken wreck of a man tortured by grief and self-loathing, Stumpy a stubborn motormouth coot, Colorado a laid-back cowboy whose chief allegiance is to himself, and Feathers a good-time grifter looking for something more substantial than the high life. These five performances are exceptional, particularly Wayne, who underplays his hero as a grumpy pragmatist, and Martin, who proves in this movie what a truly fine actor he was capable of being. This cast has a terrific easy rapport, typified by the quiet moment when Martin and Nelson duet together. The direction is a textbook example of how to construct a good movie; the physical landscape of the town and the relationships between the characters are painted with simple clarity, scenes flow together seamlessly, the photography and editing are dynamic but unhurried, atmosphere and subtext are subtle yet effective - the work of a brilliant director. This film exemplifies the richest themes of the western - the importance of courage, friendship, loyalty, honour, dignity, love and trust in a lawless age - but it's also cracking good fun all the way, full of humour, badinage, suspense, action and romance. Although its traditional heroic sensibilities were largely usurped in the sixties by the equally brilliant films of Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah, its influence on the western genre and many aspiring filmmakers (check out John Carpenter's semi-remake Assault On Precinct 13) is inestimable. A great American movie. 7/10",

The killer's brother, a wealthy rancher, has hired a small army of professional mercenaries, with the intent to rescue him from prison. The sheriff has resisted against bandits with the help of unusual friends...Mr. Hawks has, above all, drew attention of the audience to the protagonists in this film. Characterization is not ideal, but this is a very bold move. Gunfights in a tense atmosphere are certainly part of this film. However, melodrama with comic and somewhat ironic reflections is primary in the story. Dialogues are simple and witty. The final calculation is very fast and exciting, but it does not represent a classic confrontation between good and bad guys in the Wild West.John Wayne as Sheriff John T. Chance is one sturdy and charming character. He has offered a confident performance. Mr. Wayne is a real macho with an ironic attitude and a clear objective in this film. Angie Dickinson as Feathers is a traveling entertainer. She is a chatty lady and sheriff's support. Two of them created a special story. Unfortunately, the chemistry between the two of them, was not good. Romance, except for some comic and sexy interruptions, was unconvincing.Dean Martin as Dude is a former sheriff's deputy and a local drunk. He leads the battle with self-esteem. His character is serious and credible. He is the element of surprise and healing in this film. Ricky Nelson as Colorado Ryan just did not get the right opportunity. A young gunman, who has swaggered with his guns and a guitar. Walter Brennan (Stumpy) as a crippled and garrulous deputy is truly funny.Perhaps, this is only a conservative response to \"High Noon\", but I think that this film is an enjoyable western fun with pretty unusual protagonists, who are resisting violence in the background of the story.",

Angie Dickinson is another who comes in for criticism but although her performance is not a particularly confident one, again it fits the role she has to play in competing with the guys and flirting with the big man. John Wayne brings a legendary back story all his own and if he seems at times to be coasting, why should he not? Completely in control, he is ably assisted by a fantastic performance from Dean Martin and a very likable one from Walter Brennan.

As I've said before in other reviews, I think the decline in the western film is in part due to advances in color photography. Once the exaggerated hues of Technicolor dimmed, the west just didn't seem as bright.The one flaw of Rio Bravo (and a lot of films at the time) is how badly integrated the romantic subplot between Wayne and Angie Dickenson was with the rest of the script.

            "content": "Rio Bravo is simply about a small-town sheriff who arrests local bad guy's brother and only had the help of a drunk, a cripple and young gunfighter. John Wayne plays the sheriff in one of my favorite films of his. In fact Wayne had taken a break from the western genre for ten years before returning alongside two talented musicians in Dean Martin and Rickey Nelson. What do you do when you have two famous singers in a film together? You come up with one of my favorite scenes of the two singing together - guitar in hand - in the jail house.Putting their musical talents out of the question, the two hold their own with Dean Martin's portrayal of Dude; an alcoholic we join on his first day of sobriety. The once accurate two gun man is constantly questioning his ability to shoot with his shaky hands, but proves time and time again he is capable of getting the job done. We're introduced to Dude as he attempts to fish out a silver dollar from the spittoon on his hands and knees; only to be standing tall by films end. While Ricky Nelson's Colorado adds a much needed young gun to the aging dynamic of the group which apparently was role meant for Elvis Presley.I absolutely love this film and would put it as one of my favorite westerns of all time - probably just one notch below The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. It has the classic western tropes with a more gritty approach. The only thing that threw me off a bit was the romance between John T. Chance and the stunningly beautiful Angie Dickinson's Feathers. She is introduced as twenty-two years old while we're meant to assume Chance is in his late 40s, early 50s. I automatically assumed Feathers would end up with Colorado and when she started in on Chance I cringed a bit. I guess we can just chalk it up as; those were the times of the old west.This film is widely considered director Howard Hawks' final masterpiece after a long career. He is able to place you in the character's shoes while watching; feeling the edge the town is on throughout. The character's are meant to feel larger than life on the smaller built set; a creative choice by Hawks that worked. If you haven't seen this film I'd highly recommend it because just for the actors alone it is a time capsule of the 1950s and a classic western that is sure to entertain.",

            "content": "This highly lauded 1959 western contains an intimate clique of haywire individuals who secure their reparation through group effort and brushing off exclusive self-sufficiency. The nixing of real names and the clannish custom of nicknames like Chance, Dude, Colorado and Stumpy by this humble troupe of losers and odd men out epitomizes a formation of cumulative self-coinage, which is imperative for them, into an able and firmly self-reliant regiment of heroism, a demonstration of the men's longing to embody gingerly makeshift mock-mythic whimsical story lines for their lives.Supposedly, this gunslinger ballad was made as a comeback against High Noon, which is often seen to be an parable aimed at the Hollywood blacklist, a criticism of McCarthyism. Wayne approached director Howard Hawks to tell the story his way. Wayne was a conservative and an unyielding partisan of blacklisting. He felt insulted by Fred Zinnemann's classic western. So in Rio Bravo, his character is encircled by allies such as deputy Dean Martin recovering from alcoholism, young gunfighter Ricky Nelson, ranting and raving old man Walter Brennan, Mexican innkeeper Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez, and Angie Dickinson, and again and again rejects help from anyone he doesn't think is fit to help him, yet in the climactic showdown they come to help him anyhow. All this supposed subtext I find extremely annoying, but all the same, I feel comfortable enough watching a John Wayne film like Rio Bravo, because unlike John Ford, who was so vain he might've taken his own hand in marriage, notoriously clever Howard Hawks avoids the era's often extreme religious ardor, schmaltz, flag-waving populism and maudlin mushiness. Fortunately, I don't feel that Wayne's intentions resonate.The opening scene, with positively no dialogue, is a testament to flexibility of the prolific director, famous for his gabby, street-survivalist classics like His Girl Friday, To Have and Have Not and The Big Sleep for instance. Rio Bravo is nevertheless more talk than action, which is part of its charm, but Hawks fashions a cliquish succession of compositions and dismisses all but two close-ups. In the opening, Dino's town drunk, enters a saloon wanting a drink. Joe Burdette, seeing Dude eying his glass, throws a silver dollar into a spittoon to mock him. Just as Dude goes for the spittoon, John Wayne's Tough Interceder protagonist Sheriff John T. Chance kicks the spittoon away, judgmentally looking at Dude with dejection and repugnance. As Chance turns to face Joe Burdette, Dude snatches up a piece of wood and clubs Chance on the head, knocking him out. Dude then starts toward Burdette, but two of his hired cowboys seize Dude and Burdette starts to beat him up. An onlooker grasps Burdette's arm so he can't swing on Dude again. Burdette draws his gun and shoots the bystander. The close-up of Joe's revolver firing is the first of the two close-ups. Burdette then leaves the saloon and sets out for another one seeming to have already forgotten about the ugly scenario.Rio Bravo is the kind of film that wants the audience to relax for its pleasantries. It's a male bonding picture with comic reliefs, heartthrobs, tough guys and even cool cats. It's about the things that we don't normally see in westerns, which are usually bone-dry parables, for better or worse, with a very impersonal edge. The music here is a big part of the film's lounging effect. Because it starred a crooner, Martin, and a teen idol, Nelson, Hawks includes three performances by them. Martin sings My Rifle, My Pony, and Me accompanied by Nelson, after which Nelson sings a brief version of Get Along Home, Cindy, accompanied by Martin and Brennan. God forbid Wayne sing, what with his masculinity complex and all. As a foil to these quasi musical numbers, the musical score itself by Dimitri Tiomkin includes El Deg\u00fcello, a nostalgic air which is played several times to layer suspense. Nelson recognizes the melody and tells the song's history.The Texas town in which the film is set is hardly anything but a soundstage as our band of brothers fortifies themselves. It is in the jailhouse and the Mexican-run inn that the movie plunges, where Sheriff Chance determines that he nurture a family of friends, a small network on whom he can rely for both affection (exclusively Dickinson) and support (everybody else except Dickinson). We begin to enjoy seeing such moments as when Dino and Brennan share a laugh that when they encounter Joe Burdette and his minions again, the tension is already perceived by us, the audience, because the camaraderie of the good guys makes us abhor the idea of any of them getting shot. There are long intervals, but nonetheless Hawks manifests his urge for consistent inspiration at the hub of excitement, whether it be fighting, shooting, singing, talking or sitting.",

Walter Brennan plays \"Stump\" virtually the same character he was in Hawks' 1948 \"Red River.\" The great Claude Akins and TV sheriff John Russell are solid as the bad guys, the Burdette brothers. Ricky Nelson, in his prime as an early teen R&R performer and featured weekly on the insipid sit-com \"Ozzie & Harriet\" plays 'Dude\" (you gotta love the nicknames in this-Colorado, Stumpy, Dude, Feathers) a young hot shot gunslinger who joins Sheriff Dukes team. Angie Dickinson plays the gorgeous saloon girl who for some reason becomes Wayne's love interest. Never mind she's young enough to easily be his daughter. The romance is about the only real negative to this, although it gets a bit slow in a few other parts, about 10-15 minutes could have been trimmed.",

There are plenty of other worthy westerns from the Duke, such as \"The Searchers\" and \"Red River\", but this one is seemingly the most electric of all his westerns. The acting from everyone is wonderful. The synopsis is simple - try to keep the bad guy with dangerous connections in jail until the marshal can get there. He has just a small handful of highly varied characters to help out. But this makes for a very captivating two hours plus some. Besides fun tension and great wit, this has some of the most enjoyable multiple-character developments of any film I can think of. I can highly recommend this, as you can hate westerns and still probably enjoy this movie.",

            "content": "I've seen Rio Bravo two or three times. It is a well above average western. It is more \"adult\" than the typical western of the period. The dialogue makes it a cut above the routine. Wayne is good in the lead. Radiant Angie Dickenson makes for a good love interest in one of her earlier films. Dean Martin is well-cast as the recovering drunk/deputy. And Walter Brennan is perfect as the old coot/deputy. The bit of casting that mystifies me every time I watch Rio Bravo is Ricky Nelson as Colorado Ryan, the young, honest gun hand. Why in the world Ricky Nelson? I could think of four or five better even if there is some insistence that the character must be young. I realize this is the epitome of hindsight but how about Clint Eastwood in the part? Paul Newman maybe. Were Vic Morrow or Ben Gazzara considered? Okay, I'll stop.The only other problem some might have is Angie Dickenson's romantic chase of John Wayne. There is nearly 30 year age gap between the two. I am now \"older\" so that is not so I much a complaint as an observation. Anyway, if you are a fan of 1950s westerns, Rio Bravo is pretty solid. It averages about a 8 rating on this website. I can't go that high. I gave it a 7. Blame Ricky Nelson.",

Howard Hawks directed western-lite is underpopulated, but is nevertheless full of wily good cheer, shootin', spittin' and singin'. John Wayne's cowboy is matched up quite nicely with ex-shady lady Angie Dickinson, while scene-stealing Walter Brennan gets most of the funny lines. Hawks later tried to duplicate this film's success with the lookalikes \"El Dorado\" in 1966 and \"Rio Lobo\" in 1970, both starring Wayne, but this is the one you want.

In this particular version, Dean Martin is a run-down sheriff who has lost all self-respect and is busy drinking his way to the bottom of the barrel--but old friend John Wayne drifts into town and soon sets about whipping him into shape. With old-timer Walter Brennan and youngster Ricky Nelson at their sides, and with a little support from Angie Dickinson, they clean up the town.As the first of the three versions, RIO BRAVO generally receives the most approval--but although enjoyable, I have always felt it compares unfavorably with EL DORADO. Both films have a relaxed tone, neatly mixing the western-style action with healthy doses of enjoyable comedy, but of the two RIO BRAVO seems much looser in both script and execution and somewhat less well cast. Then pop-star Ricky Nelson is cast in an effort to appeal to teenagers, and believe it or not the film comes to a grinding halt that he might perform the obligatory song; in the meantime, the usually expert Angie Dickinson is broadsided by some of the worst dialogue this side of the Pecos.Even so, Wayne and Martin play very well and have considerable chemistry--certainly more than enough to hold your interest right through to the end--and although the film sometimes feels slow, when the action kicks in it kicks in hard and with plenty of excitement.Gary F.

The scenes are awkward despite the efforts of two good actors.In a movie that should build tension towards it's climax it pauses for a scene with two musical numbers.Rickey NelsonIt's too long. Especially for a slowly-paced film with nothing of any gravity to share.It's derivative story. Told too many times by the director, Howard Hawks, and Wayne. (AND, told better by the two AFTER Rio Bravo).A ludicrous, implausible final shoot-out scene that offers no emotional payoffIt's not all bad, of course.

Full of recognisable people playing to an easily recognisable plot it's certainly not too taxing on the mind and a thoroughly enjoyable classic Western, made by past masters of the genre. And artists who thoroughly knew how to create something clever and entertaining as routine.It starts as a balletic silent, culminating with a good natured bystander getting shot dead point blank and the guilty baddie eventually dragged off to jail by Sheriff John Wayne and Deputy Dean Martin. For the next 2 hours there's plenty of scheming to spring him out by the baddies' brother and gang, romance, comedy and soap from the cast, all in the best Howard Hawks tradition. With the sheer length it can get a bit confusing whether Martin is succeeding beating the bottle and whether Wayne believes him, whether Angie Dickinson is succeeding winning Wayne's heart, whether smart kid Ricky Nelson is succeeding in minding his own business, whether cantankerous Walter Brennan is going to succeed shooting anyone by accident - but I would've loved a 4 hour version! And there was probably enough possibilities in here for a 26 part condensed soap series, so maybe Hawks did well to squeeze it all in. Sergio Leone must have seen this and learnt all he needed to do was tell similar stories similarly but turn up the sex and violence.It's not perfect (eg Wayne conking out so quickly after he tripped on the string at the bottom of the hotel stairs) but still beautiful to behold, and over and over again.

            "content": "This is a good example of viewing a film 'then' and 'now'. RIO BRAVO was a big movie with the Saturday Matin\u00e9e crowd in its original release, in 1959. Every kid in the neighborhood saw it. We loved it. But what about years later, being 60 rather than 13. How does it hold up? Just what went into creating a picture with such wide appeal? Take the grizzled,old veteran Westerner, the 'Duke', himself. Cast him as the solo Lawman, facing a tough battle in a Town that's a veritable Powder Keg, just ready to 'splode real good! Now, we add a Big Time, Big Ranch Owner and Wealthy No Goodnik, Nathan Burdette(John Russell). Let Burdette's less 'urbane', but just as nasty brother, Joe Burdette.Let's have everybody's favourtie TV Grandfather, old Amos McCoy*, himself, Walter Brennan as that lovable, old coot of a Deputy/Comic Relief, \"Stumpy\". After all, a town needs a deputy to stay in the office and be the \"Offical Town Jailer.\" Being the Old West, an awful lot of the action would have to take place in a Saloon. A Saloon means Beer, Whiskey and drunken hands. It also nurtures a steady succession of Poker, even more than we have on Cable TV nowadays. The Gambling draws a lot of professional gamblers, and a steady supply of those Ladies with bad reputations. You know, the type you date, but never marry. So, along comes lovely, leggy \"Feathers\"(Angie Dickinson). She has a bad reputation that is undeserved. She has to live it down.Now RIO BRAVO, unlike most Westerns, has not just one,but two (2) singers. We have Crooner Dean Martin as 'Dude', a has been Deputy trying to get back his confidence and respect. Teen Idol, Rick Nelson is young gunslinger/cattle drover, turned Deputy, 'Colorado' Ryan.Ward Bond (Major Adams on WAGON TRAIN) plays a trail boss, just passing through town, but he is not afraid to help old friend,Sherioff John T. Chance (the Duke), no matter what. Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez gives a serio-comic performance as the Mexican Hotel Keeper.** All levity aside, the film involves a killing by Joe Burdette (Claude Aikins)and the job of maintaining the safety of the town against the seemingly endless number of hired guns that brother Nathan (John Russell) would keep running at them.The Fim has some spectacular action scenes. The Logistical Problems of staging Pitched Gun Battles and the accompanying Equinne Choreography involved are well executed and even fresh.There are some very comical scenes as well as some highly dramatic ones. One very touching scene near the beginning of the film involves Dean Martin, Claude Aikins and a 'Cartwheel'(Silver Dollar). It really helped to both give a background as well as to set the serious, sympathetic tone of the main story line.At 141 minutes, it seems to go on and on and on. After all, we had been conditioned to the hour and half-hour TV series format, complete with commercial time, for trips to the kybo and the refrigerator.When viewed recently, we found it to be a little long, yes. But the extra time is used to amplify and strengthen the story.It was not just padding for padding's sake.It seems that a lot of film critics and writers seem to agree. For you see, this RIO BRAVO is now seen as a prime example of the Western Film at its best.. * Walter Brenman was Grandpappy Amos McCoy on the ABC Sitcom, \"THE REAL McCOYS\"(1957-59). He starred in 2 other series, THE TYCOON(1964-65) and THER GUNS OF WILL SONNETT(1967-69). ** Having done some local radio work in Texas, Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez was discovered as a contestant on Groucho Marx's NBC TV YOU BET YOUR LIFE.

I'm not familiar with that movie, but I'm wondering why. John Wayne (\"Sheriff Chance\") truly played John Wayne, which was never hard to do. All of his later movies - as other people have noted - were profitable because of his large fan-base and choosing popular artists to draw-in their fans, too.

They lean on shadowed walls, sit back in dusty saloons, and play ominous, trumpet melodies, largely unseen from the perspective of our heroes. Because there is nothing for Wayne and company to do about them being there, a large portion of the film is spent on character development while the audience waits for the proverbial pin to drop.My favorite of these character arcs belongs to Dean Martin's \"Dude.\" He personifies the film's oozing anxiety with his sweaty brow and edgy disposition, a result of being on the wagon. John Wayne is tremendous, of course he is, but here it's because of his relationship with a fervid gambler-on-the-run (Angie Dickinson) who's infatuated with his endearing stubbornness.There are moments of action tossed in, and of course it ends in a bang, but the film is more akin to the first forty-five minutes of Carpenter's HALLOWEEN than it is to any western I've ever seen in the way it works to build tension. Entirely, it takes place in a small town, trading the traditional sprawling landscape for the claustrophobia of a single, dusty street.

            "content": "There's almost a kind of bridge between the westerns of old and the sort of last legs of the western in this film- it has the good ol' sensibilities of the classics (loyalty, honor, the power of the sheriff, the quirkiness and durability of the ones around him, shoot-outs), while also giving some room for some more modern ones (Dean Martin as 'Dude', Angie Dickinson as 'feathers', and the overall excitement). It has a song at one point (obviously for one its stars, the late Ricky Nelson, a popular singer at the time). It has the crotchety, funny old man (Walter Brennan as Stumpy, one of his best roles). And, of course, the 'Duke' John Wayne, who has his usual swagger and qualities that make him a prime figure of the 'male' in films. This time though, he does have some of his tough exterior shed away a little, maybe.Howard Hawks, if nothing else, is most powerful as a storyteller, doing almost nothing with the style of his camera to be creative except to shoot these people, going through the motions. The story, which later was used as a basis for John Carpeneter's Assault on Precinct 13, has Wayne as the Sheriff and Dean Martin as his on and off again drunken deputy 'Dude', who have to look after a criminal in their jail, as he has a brother with a gang who are plotting to break him out. As the Sheriff, or Chance as he's called, has to deal with this, he also has the woman, and the old man, and Dude (Martin is great in the film, maybe the best male performance of the lot), not to mention the hot-to-trot young gunslinger played by Nelson.In all, it's the kind of genre film that should be taken seriously on one hand, but on the other, its meant to be a rollicking good time through the less tense and exciting parts (and there are quite a few from a director who once said that 'there's no action without danger). It lacks a kind of urgency that some of Hawks' other films have, and occasionally Wayne is a little too much \"The Duke\" to see if he's really giving a well-rounded performance as the sheriff. But besides that, it makes for some very memorable moments, a slick ending, and some endearing performances. It's also a film that takes its characters to heart as much as its story; a credit to screenwriters Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett (the later one of my favorites of the period). Not quite a masterpiece, but its definitely worth watching at least once if you're getting into the genre.",

When the killer is taken, Dude decides to re-join Chance as his deputy.Meanwhile, a lady gambler known only as \"Feathers\" (Angie Dickenson) arrives in town and a relationship gradually develops between her and Chance. An attempt is made by Burdette's men to goad Chance into a gunfight but they are thwarted through the efforts of Wheeler's friend \"Colorado\" (Ricky Nelson) and Feathers, who come to the aid of the beleaguered sheriff.With Dude and Colorado now helping out, Chance awaits the final showdown with Burdette until.......The early scenes between Wayne and Dickenson are reminiscent of the May/September romance of Bogey and Bacall in Hawks' \"To Have and To Have Not\" (1944). Hawks was not above re-using old material. In fact \"Eldorado\" (1966) is a virtual re-make of \"Rio Bravo\" again with Wayne as the sheriff, Robert Mitchum in the Dean Martin role and James Caan in the Ricky Nelson part.Also in the cast are Pedro Gonzolez-Gonzolez and Estelita Rodriguez as Carlos and Consuela the hotel proprietors and western veterans Bob Steele, Myron Healey, Yakima Canutt, Riley Hill, Chuck Roberson (who was also Wayne's stunt double) and Eugene Iglesias play a variety of small roles.

At his side are recovering alcoholic, Dude (Dean Martin), young gunslinger Colorado (Ricky Nelson) and cantankerous old cripple Stumpy (Walter Brennan) who doesn't leave the jail for the majority of the film.This isn't so much about the plot as it is the characters, atmosphere and tension. The Duke is perfect as John T.Chance. His effortless star quality and laid back persona comes across great in every scene he's in. He's tough, brave and not scared of any man but introduce him to a woman and it's an whole other matter. When he meets sexy new woman in town (Angie Dickinson)he's shy and awkward and completely out of his comfort zone.One of the best aspects of the film is the fact that it was made in 1959, when men were supposed to be men, rough, tough and \"a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do\" but surprisingly the men here are portrayed as warm, flawed and vulnerable.It's way ahead of it's time in that respect. This is also a buddy film. The main characters have an underlining respect and affection for each other that is hardly ever spoken, it's shown purely through their expressions and actions. For instance the scene where Chance hands Dude his guns back that Dude had sold to buy booze and didn't even know Chance had, speaks volumes. As does the scene where Stumpy mistakes Dude for a villain and nearly kills him. Dude finally realises just how low he has sunk after getting cleaned up if his own friend didn't recognise him and Stumpy feels terrible and scared that he nearly killed him. There's so many great moments between the cast.This isn't really a movie about holding a prisoner at all, that plot point is merely an excuse to show the loyalty and friendship between the characters. The cast is great and the chemistry between them is terrific. It's consistently humorous without coming across as forced and on many occasions even looks ad-libbed it's so natural. Even the moment when the guys lock themselves away in the jail and kick back for a sing along (minus the Duke) somehow works.The bad guys are out in the street, the sheriff and his men are locked up bored. What are you going to do? It's a fun scene that fits in nicely rather than jarring with the other events that play out. And a mention to the Mexican tune that occasionally plays throughout the film which is a great piece of music. The Duke seemed to have an habit of starring in westerns that were ahead of their time and before the spaghetti westerns came along, this Hollywood western already seemed to be showing off a spaghetti vibe with it's scenery and music. In fact it's the very music that inspired Sergio Leone for the type of sound he wanted from Ennio Morricone for A Fistful Of Dollars.All in all, Rio Bravo is a fun movie and one of the all-time great westerns. A leisurely paced film with endearing characters, witty dialogue and well staged shootouts. They really don't make them like this anymore.",

About ten minutes worth. The rest is just a waste of time, the actors going through some kind of horrible amateur motions. Nothing like a bunch of people from the actors studio throwing on some costumes and being themselves, I guess. However, the person here who spotted just how good Martin is in this is right: it is a wonderful performance. As for the rest of the bunch, well, right its New York, actors studio. This is not a western folks. For that try Red River. The greatest western ever made. However, the scene where Martin makes the guy grab the coin out of the spittoon is fabulous, in fact nearly every scene Martin is in is very watchable.",

            "content": "Usually I don't like these types of old westerns. They often present a \"let's go camping with our cell phones and gourmet freeze dried food\" version of the old west. I think the old westerns tend to make it more glamorous than it was. I do like many of the recent westerns. Probably starting with \"The Unforgiven\", and I also like any of the classic spaghetti westerns with Mr. Eastwood. Those are often more gritty and quite different compared to this type of \"amusement park western\" with John Wayne.However, this one was just plain dang fun with great characters and a believable romance (Every time there's any type of romance in any movie that the film maker's want me to believe in, I compare it to Star Wars Episodes 2 and 3. Two movies to create a convincing love story and it failed miserably). What I appreciated was that it wasn't \"simplistic\". The developing romance between the Wayne and Dickinson's character had some \"relatively\" complex elements that weren't simple western cookie cutter, not all spelled out, type of cinematic relationship. Yeah it wasn't that complex but it was interesting to figure out the motivations and fun to follow along. There was even some comic relief! Quite frankly, Angie Dickinson was a major hottie in her day. Whoa! She looked familiar but I couldn't place the face. Didn't recognize her AT ALL. I had to check the credits.Some reviewers don't care for the romance and the longer story development elements, but just like one of those man made climbing walls at a sporting goods stores, without it there aren't any good handholds. I need those parts to hang on to, keeping my interest so I can keep climbing to the top.Without some slowing down and something to care about, the rest of the action is just another old western that bores the heck out of me. I know people who \"fast forward\" or \"talk\" through the slow bits in action movies. I am the complete opposite. Without that back story, without the stuff that happens BETWEEN the action sequences, I have no commitment or involvement in the outcome. Without light there's no dark. Without contrasts it's all \"one color\".I couldn't sleep, it was early early morning so I was up anyway, flipped on the TV and this was on. Was going to change channel but was too lazy and hadn't planned to watch anything \"with commitment\", just background noise. But then I got sucked in and before I knew it was totally engrossed in the characters and story and really enjoying it.The only thing I might have left out would have been the kind of out of place, awkward \"musical break\" from the two major singers in the cast. I thought this would be coming at some point but hoped they might skip over it... but... at least there wasn't too much of it. I can't imagine two \"cowboys\" with singing voices like that just randomly thrown together in the same town in the same dangerous situation. Another one of those \"throw out all believability\" old western clich\u00e9.The Colorado character seemed a bit out of place and unconventional but I think he pulled it off. Acting was a bit stiff but I didn't mind. He was almost like a \"Deus Ex Machina\". Might be too strong to say that but close enough. He was always in the right place at the right time.Some say it was too long? Wow... I was actually disappointed when it ended. I wanted more. Guess I have to watch some Gunsmoke reruns. I had to give it a 10 out of 10 based on how much I enjoyed it. When the time just flies by without consciously noticing, and I feel sad when the credits roll, I have to give it a 10.",

When Dude is giving another chance for redemption, especially since he tries hard to quit drinking. When one of those trouble makers by the name of Joe Brudette (Claude Atkins) starts making trouble in the town. Chance and Dude takes care of that problem, since Brudette is a killer.

Now Chance and Dude finds themselves in trouble. But they are not alone, since they have help from John's loyal jail guard old crippler Grumpy (Walter Brennan), a young eager gunslinger Colorado Ryan (Ricky Nelson), a kind man who owns the hotel/saloon (Perdo Gonzalez Gonzalez) and a clever care-free woman named Feathers (Angie Dickension), who finds Chance interesting.Directed by Howard Hawks (His Girl Friday, Red River, Scarface) made an intelligent Western that has a big heart, great performance, creative action sequences and an refreshing sense of humour. I never seen this movie until now, although i heard of Hawks. I never seen his films before. I did see \"The Thing from Another World\". Which he co-directed but he's uncredited. The picture still looks great, since it's been nearly 50 years ago it came out. This is very well filmed by cinematographer Russell Harlan, which he's makes this feature looks stylish for its time. There's many good sequences... especially when it's character-driven dialogue scenes, moments of romance or action.The two-disc set from \"Rio Bravo\". DVD is been digitally remastered for clean picture-quality and sound. Disc 1 has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono Sound. DVD includes trailers from other \"John Wayne\" pictures and an informative if somewhat quiet commentary by \"Time\" film critic:Richard Schickel and filmmaker:John Carpenter (Assault on Precient 13, Halloween, The Thing). Disc 2 includes an documentary about Howard Hawks' film-making career, featurette on \"Rio Bravo\" with interviews from cast member Dickenson, film critics & fans of this movie and a small featurette about the film's location and the other classic Westerns were filmed there. \"Rio Bravo\" is a movie that still looks good after 50 years, it shows how strong that this feature could such an impact over all these years. Some viewers might find this silly at times, especially when the Characters start bonding and singing in the sheriff's station. But it's all in good fun, probably the only complaint in this movie. It's goes on a bit too long than it should. But still, don't miss this excellent movie. Screenplay by Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett (The Empire Strikes Back, The Big Sleep, The Long Goodbye).

            "content": "One of the best westerns I've seen, directed by the great Howard Hawks on his return to Hollywood after a four year gap. I frankly didn't fancy the cast-list here as I'm no great admirer of John Wayne and didn't think Dean Martin capable of acting straight, but they unquestionably gell, with the glue of old-timer Walter Huston binding them together. I read with interest the IMDb trivia section for this movie and noted that it was posited by Hawks and Wayne as an alternative take on the plot of \"High Noon\", as ageing sheriff Wayne marshals his sparse and motley crew of drunkard Martin, invalid Huston and bright-eyed kid, then current pop-star Ricky Nelson (I wonder how first preference Elvis would have worked) in trying to detain the murderous brother of the corrupting Mr Big of the town, Burdette, who it seems can buy everyone else in the town to his side, bar Wayne's team, the latter assisted by visiting show-girl-cum-gambler Angie Dickinson, and a husband and wife Spanish hotelier. The film grips from the start as we're introduced to Martin's desperate drunk and soon after Wayne's archetypal commanding, incorruptible authority figure. The story unfolds naturally, always involving the viewer until it reaches its literally explosive climax, but takes in along the way an unlikely-seeming romance between the young and spirited Dickinson and the old curmudgeon Wayne and Martin's own battle against the bottle and for his own self-respect. Old Huston delivers most of the humour with his bickering and prattling but Ricky Nelson is completely out of his depth here as young gunslinger Colorado, at times seeming positively star-struck between Wayne and Martin. No matter, even his wooden acting, plus Dickinson's over-accented playing, can't detract from the excellence of the other three. I could also have done without the musical interlude, obviously a sop to Nelson's teenage followers and perhaps the baddies could have been painted a bit blacker, but this was still an enthralling yarn, masterfully helmed by one of the greatest of all directors.",

            "content": "Rio Bravo was famously conceived as a red-blooded riposte to the controversial 1952 Western High Noon. Now, whether this was the primary reason for its being made, or whether it was always intended simply as a decent example of the Western genre is not entirely clear. Director Howard Hawks was a man who liked to add a little story to the creation of each of his classics. But however significant the link between the two pictures, the similarity in plots and differences on almost every other level does invite comparisons. One of the few flaws of High Noon (a good picture in itself, but not a Western classic) is that it does not really throw itself into the Western genre with all its rugged atmosphere and time-honoured clich\u00e9. Rio Bravo on the other hand is a Western of the purest and most whole-hearted kind.Howard Hawks only directed five proper Westerns, most of them towards the end of his career, but he is often remembered as one of the most important Western directors alongside Ford, Peckinpah, Leone and Eastwood. Why? I think it is because he really captured the spirit of the Old West, perhaps even better than those other directors just mentioned. In all his pictures he showed a knack for atmosphere, and he's really good at just creating a certain look of dusty plains, windswept homesteads and mean-looking saloons, all under careful control too. Take that opening scene. We first see Dean Martin in amongst all this typical saloon business, then all of a sudden he's framed in mid-shot against a bare wall, and the busy establishing shot has turned into a close look at individuals. Hawks was also a master at pacing, and really creates some classics of the tense standoff. A great example is the scene where a gunman is hiding in the saloon loft. The tension is closed down by the carefully measured performances \u2013 the gaps the characters leave between their lines, the leisurely walks, punctuating sounds like John Wayne slamming the door. Gradually the pace speeds up, with lines delivered a little quicker, and a little more nervous movement around the room, right up until the point where Martin fires. The effect High Noon achieves through rapid editing Hawks can achieve simply through well-choreographed long takes.Star John Wayne is of course a key ingredient in an archetypal Western such as this, and it is in Hawks' careful pacing of shootouts that you can see one of the major reasons why. The Duke was a very rhythmic actor \u2013 delivering lines in dribs and drabs, walking like he was never in a hurry to go anywhere but aiming to do something pretty big once he got there \u2013 and this really made him ideal for those iconic and tension-filled standoffs. Rio Bravo sees another steady and commanding performance from him. His co-star Dean Martin also gives one of his finest turns. Considering he is playing an alcoholic, the script never actually demands he play drunk, which is a good thing since it wouldn't do to have the audience laughing at him as well as the villains (this was a mistake made in the loose 1966 remake El Dorado). Instead, he gives a tortured and poignant portrayal of a man torn between getting his next drink and salvaging his dignity, and in so doing places himself squarely at the heart of the movie.Although Rio Bravo is very much a town Western, set entirely among the homesteads without ever venturing out into the really wild west, we are nevertheless continually reminded that the open plain with all its romance and danger is not far away. Gunmen ride into town with the dust flying off them, the far-off hills and cactus plants are always to be glimpsed between the ramshackle buildings, and the Dmitri Tiomkin song \"My Rifle, my pony, and me\" (a great second-act pick-me-up) tells us just where any man of the west would rather be. This again is something High Noon failed to conjure up \u2013 that sentimental allure of the unspoiled wilderness. Rio Bravo does not present a historically accurate account of the West, but it is completely faithful to the classic vision of the Western, a land where young cowboys look like rock 'n' roll stars and old cowboys look like they were chiselled out of the mountains themselves. This is one of the giants of a genre that once was.",

            "content": "The ultimate John Wayne movie for people who like John Wayne movies, \"Rio Bravo\" features the Duke playing not against type, like \"The Searchers,\" \"True Grit,\" or \"Red River,\" but to type, as the strong, good-natured champion of law and order battling bad guys in the Old West.Wayne is Sheriff John T. Chance, who faces trouble when he jails the brother of nasty rancher Nathan Burdette for murder. Burdette sends some desperados to break his brother out. It's up to Chance to make sure they don't, with the help of \"gimp-legged old man\" Stumpy (Walter Brennan) and a drunk called Dude (Dean Martin).\"Is that all you got?\" Chance is asked.\"That's what I got,\" he replies.\"Rio Bravo\" is a marvelously quotable film, in part because it has so much dialogue in it. Instead of shooting, the main characters spend much of the time talking about the battle to come, passing the time by getting on each other's nerves. Dude is a bit of a walking nerve on account of his trying to quit drinking, and though Chance finds himself a girl in the form of the captivating \"Feathers\" (Angie Dickinson, looking like a young Renee Zellweger), it's his relationship with Dude that's central to the film.Dude figures out early that Chance is leaning on him in part because he figures Dude needs the impetus to get in shape. \"Be nice to him, and he'll fall apart in small pieces,\" Chance confides in Stumpy. Noticing Dude suffering from the shakes, Chance suggests a walk around the town. Dude tells him he knows what's up, sounding hurt. \"Don't set yourself up as bein' so special,\" Chance snarls back.The chemistry between Wayne and Martin goes a long way toward making \"Rio Bravo\" so special, aided by Dickinson, Brennan, Ricky Nelson as a young fence-sitter handy with a gun named Colorado (easy to ignore because he doesn't crowd anyone, but still good in his understated way), and especially director Howard Hawks, who shows here as he did with \"Only Angels Have Wings\" and \"Hatari!\" that action scenes work better when you have more invested in the characters experiencing them.I never understood the notion, advanced apparently by Hawks and Wayne, that this is an answer film to \"High Noon,\" because Will Kane in the latter film asks around town for help and thus shows himself somehow less manly a lawman. It just doesn't wash. Kane takes on the Millers pretty much alone, whereas Chance has deputies from the start. Perhaps it was the tone of \"High Noon\" that bothered them, the sparse, apathetic nature of the town and its people. While \"High Noon\" literally ticks its way to an efficient resolution, \"Rio Bravo\" demands you slow down and take stock of things.Yes, \"Rio Bravo\" is slow, and far-fetched in parts, like when Dude and Chance ignite dynamite without fuses or matches. But it's hard to whine about the two-hour 20-minute running time when you get such a comfortable feeling watching it. If you regard \"The Searchers\" as the ultimate journey film, \"Rio Bravo\" is like the destination, a place worth fighting for because it grants you the company of such vividly etched, fun-filled characters.",

            "content": "The Howard Hawks' answer to \"High Noon\" (also great, go check it out!). Its a great tale about male comradeship, professionalism and standing your ground against injustice, even when the odds are against you.The plot is fairly simple: The local sheriff (portrayed by John Wayne) locks up the criminal Joe Burdette whose brother Nathan Burdette, a rich and ruthless rancher, promises everyone who is willing to get his brother out of jail a good prize, resulting in the local sheriff department practically being under siege by the local thugs. Sheriff John T. Chance's job is then to hold out with his two deputies, a recovering alcoholic (brilliantly portrayed by Dean Martin) and an old man talkative man with a limp (portrayed by Walter Brennan, he adds a lot of comic relief into the story) until the Marshall arrives to take Joe Burdette with him. Later they get help from another young gun man (portrayed by Ricky Nelson, who's a good addition to the trio). Chance has to enforce law and order all while dealing with his deputies alcoholism, with non professionals offering their help and with a mysterious woman who later becomes his love interest (portrayed by Angie Dickinson, in a typical hawksian woman role).What makes this movie is so great is the great dialogue, strong performances (especially Dean Martin and John Wayne), likable characters and the great portrayal of their interactions and relationships with each other. You end up really caring about them and see them deal with their personal struggles, like you would with characters in a long running TV show, the only difference being that it happens in 2 and a half hours without feeling rushed. There are several small subplots that all add up in the end in a satisfying way, feel relevant and bring more depth into the characters.In my opinion Howard Hawks' masterpiece with a strong message. Stand your ground and do what you believe is right, even if it seems impossible. And if no one is fit to help, then do it yourself. No one is responsible for your actions, except for yourself. Good can overcome evil.One of my all time favorites and in my opinion the best western of all time. Highly recommended.

Bond was in 250 movies (a number his drinking buddy Wayne often conflated as his OWN filmography, in his later CTE-racked years), including 26 of director John Ford's and 6 of director Frank Capra's (who can forget his Bert-the-Cop in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE?). Bond and Wayne played chess, dominoes, and poker together, also serving as \"Best Man\" at each other's weddings. They both played football for the University of Southern California, though Bond was three years ahead of Wayne. Bond was about the same size as John Wayne--6' 3\", 220 pounds--but did NOT wear elevator shoes in his later years, as did Wayne. This short mentions 30 of Bond's films by name, and states that 1935 was his biggest year, when he appeared in 30 flicks!

It's basically good clean fun, with the badguys on one side wanting to spring one of their own from jail, and the Duke and a couple of sidekicks trying to stop them.What makes this film stand out as memorable is essentially the characters. Dean Martin is great as the main deputy recovering from a drunken spell and finding his knack for firing a gun again. Ricky Nelson has a smaller role as a determined young kid, and Walter Brennan is simply wonderful as the crotchety old man. The Duke is naturally a powerful presence on screen.These characters provide the entertainment, and there's plenty of action to help the film along the way as well. However, at two and a quarter hours, it is a little too long. There is a scene in the jail where Martin and Nelson show off their fine singing voices which is unnecessary to the plot. Similarly, the romance subplot between the Duke and Angie Dickenson doesn't exactly help the story along either. But then what kind of a western would this be without romance? A shorter one, sure, but also a lesser one. So basically it's as good as it can be, but with that quality also comes length. It seems to me as though that's the way it has to be.It's a good romp, definitely worth seeing once and enjoyed. Don't expect a masterpiece and you'll leave with a smile on your face. **** / *****",

            "content": "Angie Dickinson may get all the best lines in Rio Bravo, but John Wayne is the one that she surrenders to in the end. She is the prototypical Hawksian woman; witty, sharp as a knife, wielding her sexuality with provocation. Her drawl is the antithesis of Hawks' earlier screwballs and their mile-a-minute dialogue, overlapping and building to a comedic climax. When Feathers sashays and suggests a strip-search, and when she dangles her arms around his neck and pulls him in for a second kiss after a lacklustre first effort, you'll see a rare glimpse of a John Wayne character flustered.By slowing it all down, Hawks was able to build his scenes from the ground up, filling them to the brim with tension. See the iconic opening, a wordless 5 minute sequence that renders a simple bar scuffle into an operatic showdown. Dude enters from the back door a sweaty outsider, lurking in the shadows and pacing back and forth, eyes darting towards the drink. The camera doesn't rush him; you can see why Kurosawa drew inspiration from the American western, where Mifune got his steady, measured shuffle from. Dean Martin, the disgraced star, crawls to the ground for a coin, only to usher in the entrance of the town sheriff, Wayne towering over his failed prot\u00e9g\u00e9. No more than a minute later, they are holding a murderer at gunpoint together.It was filmed at the Old Tucson studio backlot, so there are no expansive vistas of the west ala John Ford. The daytime exterior shots do little to hide the appearance of a set, reflecting a campy western aesthetic (see the bickering over dynamite throwing in the climax), but the interiors of the homesteads and taverns, particularly at night, come alive. Russell Harlan's lighting is sparse, throwing long, hard shadows across the rooms; one striking shot captures the standoff between Dude and a group of tight-lipped men on Burdette's payroll from an overhead view, the stare-down framed by the shadowy recesses of the ceiling, and a bloodied man waiting behind a pillar with a gun. Patrolling after sundown, the pair find danger and menace lurking around every corner, with sudden noises (a neighing horse, or a gunshot) punctuating the nervous energy in the air.On the surface, Rio Bravo is a pure, red-blooded American western, a full-bodied tonic for the patriot in the wake of High Noon. While Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot pushed against the boundaries of the Hays Code in the same year, Hawks' film represented a return to normalcy. The rules of the game are clear cut and simple. Shoot a man and it's murder, unless he has a gun, in which case it's upholding the law. A man's worth is determined by how quick he is on the draw, and his life, mere gold pieces. Women? Window dressing, unless you're Feathers and as stubborn as a mule, in which case you become an honourary member of the posse. But even she yields to Wayne eventually.Chance, unlike Gary Cooper's Will Kane, does not ever admit he needs help, nor does he make an overt show of asking for it. Wayne, at the height of his career, was enough; strutting around with a glare and rifle, he was the living embodiment of the dutiful sheriff, the heroic figure, reaffirming his moral authority with every growl. But look who answers the call anyway. A old timing cripple, a kid gunslinger, the local drunk, a Mexican innkeeper, and a gambler; an endearing band of misfits if there ever was one. They sing and smoke together (whether it be cigarettes or villains), and have each other's backs. Wayne's tough exterior never truly cracks, but he comforts and protects in his own way. Look at his sneer of disapproval at Dude quitting and running back to the bottle; it's almost enough to force the whiskey back in. And during the film's most tender moment, the narrative pauses while three cowboys sing along to the soft strumming of a guitar. In an era of tough men and political divide, as Mark Cousins puts it, this might be the closest thing to a family the western frontier had. Chance is there, too. He does not sing, but he just might be humming along.",

            "content": "It's hard to go wrong with a western with a cast that includes John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan, Ward Bond, John Russell and Claude Akins, and with a master director like Howard Hawks. The by-play between the characters, the overlapping dialog (a Hawks trademark), the bursts of violent action all contribute to an almost perfect film. There are, however, two drawbacks that keep it from being just about perfect, one minor and one major. The minor one is Angie Dickinson. While a competent actress, she just doesn't seem to click with Wayne onscreen (although she has stated she clicked with him very well offscreen). She tries hard, and she does have her moments in the film, but overall her part drags the film down a bit. The major obstacle, though, is Ricky Nelson. It's blatantly obvious that he was brought into the movie to draw in the teenagers, as he was a major singing star of the time. He's so laid-back he's almost comatose; he mumbles his lines, and when you can understand him it sounds like he's talking in his sleep. The film comes to a screeching halt whenever he starts to talk, and even in the action scenes it loooks like he's doing everything in slow motion. You don't believe for a second that he's a tough Texas gunfighter; he looks more like a schoolboy playing hooky and hanging out with the older guys. However, Nelson isn't onscreen all the time, and when he isn't, everything clicks to make an almost perfect western . . . almost.",

John Wayne Fan Clubs might have put a bio in their social media profiles if available in those days saying, \"John Wayne in Western, Nobody does it better\". Rio Bravo is a solid proof that how simple yet excellent a western drama could be with no further intentional implications and efforts. It's just so fine without any mess, twist and thrill. A small-town sheriff in the American West enlists the help of a cripple, a drunk, and a young gunfighter in his efforts to hold in jail the brother of the local bad guy. An ordinary looking script on paper is built by extraordinary vision of director Howard Hawks. Not to forget he's the same man who had several classics in Comedy, Thriller, Noir genres and yet he grabbed the core of western genre much before we saw universal classics in the same genre. Rio Bravo has engaging screenplay and tight orders of all sequences that can be enjoyed in repeat viewing too. It has good comedy too, such a rare thing in dark Western genre. The background score is designed perfectly to help the scenes look more impactful. I kind of like so many things about this film that i even forget to mention some, nevertheless, i would go on with the mandatory ones. John Wayne delivers yet another remarkable performance as Sheriff. Like i said, nobody does it better than him when it comes to perfection in the characters for Western dramas. Rio Bravo is yet another feather on his hat that will shine with Colours forever. Angie Dickinson looks hot, Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson were good too but a real surprise was Walter Brennan. What an amazing act it was. What a great dialogue delivery and accent he had, Terrific. Overall, an evergreen Classic Western Drama by Wayne-Hawks pair.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "review_title": "The working title of the film was A BULL BY THE TAIL.",
            "content": "RIO BRAVO was both produced and directed by Howard Hawks. The working title of the film was A BULL BY THE TAIL. The screenplay was written by Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett and loosely based on a short story by B.H. McCampbell. Which is an inside joke\u0085 B.H. McCampbell was Hawks' daughter Barbara. But according to Hawks, she only came up with the ending. Most of the story is by Leigh Brackett (THE BIG SLEEP & THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK) & what Hawks came up with while shooting. John Wayne had worked once before with Hawks, back in 1948 (RED RIVER.) Hawks wanted to make RIO BRAVO as a reaction to - HIGH NOON a complete inversion in every detail. Both movies unfold chronologically, but where HIGH NOON takes place in real time, RIO BRAVO sets a surprisingly leisurely pace telling a story spread across three days. Hawks said the only thing he did like about HIGH NOON was the music by Dimitri Tiomkin; but in contrast to HIGH NOON's ballad that only the audience could hear, RIO BRAVO's score included a trumpet dirge that weighs on the characters minds. The Hollywood Reporter review described composer Dimitri Tiomkin's scoring of a \"bullfight trumpet\" playing \"El Deguelo\" as \"one of the film's most vital elements of suspense.\" Notice the great care with which the screenplay lays out its material -- in what is essentially a cinematic chess game. Every key character and plot element is introduced early along with the relationships that drive them, leading move after move to the violent end. The simple storyline has a sheriff take on, not 4 like in HIGH NOON, but 40 bad guys with some unexpected backup from the least likely characters - an alcoholic drifter, a crippled, elderly man, a naive young gunslinger, a dance-hall girl, and a hotel clerk. John Wayne was at the peak of his career in 1958 and Howard Hawks could not think of a better actor to play this lawman who embodied duty, decency, and integrity. It contains one of Wayne's best performances as Sheriff John T. Chance, playing what he himself called \"the John Wayne role.\" He even wears the same hat, now battered and torn, that he had worn in Westerns ever since John Ford's \"STAGECOACH\" (1939). Much of the strength of the character comes from the way he holds himself in reserve, not feeling the need to comment on everything. When Dean Martin and Walter Brennan get in a loud argument, Hawks holds Wayne's character in the background, observing, not interfering. Wayne is always the unspoken source of authority, he is the audience the other characters hope to impress. Yet here he calls upon the role and his own history to bring nuance and depth to the character. Even grumpy old John Ford upon seeing John Wayne back in Howard Hawks' earlier western film \"RED RIVER,\" said of Wayne \"I never knew the big son of a bitch could act.\"It has surprisingly warm romantic chemistry between Wayne and Angie Dickinson in her first major film role (she turned 78 on Sept. 30, 2009.) He never sweet-talks Dickinson's character and indeed tends to be gruff toward her, but his eyes and body language speak for him as he (and we too) fall for her. Actress Angie Dickinson's role was compared in several reviews to the role played by Lauren Bacall in another film directed by Hawks, TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT. Dickinson absolutely holds the screen against the big man. She's not a saloon floozy but a competent professional gambler accustomed to sparring with men. The film opens on Ward Bond, a wonderful character actor (his 22nd film with John Wayne) and his last major film role. Peter Bogdanovich praises the long opening sequence in \"Rio Bravo,\" which runs, nearly, five minutes without dialogue. Hawks said he wanted to get back to his silent film roots, where the tools of story telling with out dialogue pulled the audiences in much better than the pabulum of the masses called television which in the 1950s was killing the movies. Dean Martin was trying to prove he could make it on his own. Old Walter Brennan, as the peg-legged deputy, provides comic support. And, people forget he is one of only 3 actors to win three Oscars. In a lull in the action, the men relax inside the barricaded sheriff's office, and Martin, resting on his back with his hat shielding his eyes, begins to sing about a cowboy's loneliness. Nelson picks up his guitar and accompanies him. Then Ricky sings an uptempo song of his own, with Martin and even Brennan in harmony. Martin and Nelson were two of the most popular singers of the time, and the interlude functions well as an affectionate reprise for the men before the final showdown. RIO BRAVO was one of Wayne and Hawks's most successful and satisfying vehicles, which may help explain why they liked it so much and were so impressed with its potential for further exploration, that they remade it twice, once as EL DORADO and once as RIO LOBO.",

Considering they played characters named, respectively, \"Dude,\" \"Colorado,\" and \"Stumpy, you know these guys had a blast making this movie. Angie Dickinson is terrific to look at as usual, and plays Wayne's romantic interest.They're holed up in the town jail, guarding a prisoner (Claude Akins), whose powerful brother is trying to bust him out. The action is typical John Wayne/Howard Hawks (director) fare: frequent gun play and action, mixed with humorous, snappy dialog, as the film good-naturedly pokes fun at itself. (Who would expect a singing collaboration of Martin, Nelson, and Brennan?) Martin's character is a drunk trying to dry out--that sounds like an \"insert joke here\" setup, not to mention an old western clich\u00e9. But Martin's acting is strong and effective--Dude is a character that is developed well and is integral to the storyline. Brennan perfected his \"old geezer sidekick\" routine (frequently imitated by others), and Nelson obviously got a kick out of his \"young gunfighter\" role. Wayne is, of course, patriarchal, and predictably good at shooting bad guys.A cleverly done final confrontation between the two camps does not disappoint after the build-up throughout the movie. Definitely recommended for western fans, and Wayne fans, but even other viewers should find this movie a good watch.",

He plays a squeaky-clean, upstanding law enforcer, someone who is quite easy-going until provoked and always believes in doing the right thing. That was the image John Wayne stuck with for most of his career and it works in \"Rio Bravo.\" There is plenty of fun in this film, thanks to some good dialogue, being quite lighthearted in places, the story being pretty good and also for featuring some great action near the end. Dean Martin gives a better than average performance as the former sheriff who deals with his own demons via the bottle. He eventually finds his courage and regains some of his former glory. Old hands like Walter Brennan and Ward Bond give their usual sterling support, they were veterans of the Western genre. The running time is a bit long at 130 minutes but I personally don't find that a problem. In a town not far from the Mexican border, an outlaw is being held in the town jail. For John Wayne, that means the entire gang of which the outlaw is a member, shall be riding into town with the intention of springing their comrade. Wayne only has a drunken former sheriff, a deputy with a crippled leg and a young and inexperienced gunfighter for support. The direction from Howard Hawks keeps the film ticking along at a good pace. Wayne's movies with Hawks are equally as good as the ones he made with John Ford.",

            "content": "Rio Bravo has an emotional connection with me which makes reviewing it objectively virtually impossible. It is just about the most perfect example in a film, that I have ever witnessed, of action blended with a philosophy of living. Howard Hawks would, no doubt, scoff at such a description--but that is my feeling about it.I first saw the picture when I was about 10 years old in a Saturday matin\u00e9e at my local theater. The theater was packed with other kids around the same age as myself.The scene that will always live with me from that theater experience, is when, near the end of the picture, two bad guys have managed to dodge John Wayne's bullets and are coming up behind him. We see the two bad men blown away by two shotgun blasts and then we hear the familiar cackle of Stumpy, played by Walter Brennan. When that cackle was heard in the theater that afternoon, the kids in that theater erupted spontaneously into cheers. In some visceral, indefinable way, we kids identified with Stumpy, and his \"supposed uselessness'. And when Stumpy was vindicated in that moment, we felt vindicated.Rio Bravo has many moments like that, especially with its dialog. When Feathers asks Chance what he thinks she should do to avoid being unfairly harassed by lawmen wherever she goes, Chance suggests that she stop dressing the way she does. Feathers looks straight at Chance and says, \"That's the kind of thing I'd do, if I was the kind of girl you think I am, sheriff.\" Rio Bravo is a deliberately slow movie. And in its deliberateness, Rio Bravo examines a number of different themes. Some of them are: Rio Bravo is an exploration of what loyalty means. Besides the obvious loyalty of Chance and Dude and Stumpy, there is the example of Chance's friend Wheeler, who ends up dying for his loyalty. And Carlos the hotel owner, who by the end has come up to help Chance--with a shotgun that is as big as he is. But again, there is the dialog, such as when Chance hands Dude his own set of guns, that Dude had pawned long ago for a drink. Dude looks up at Chance as they are walking, \"You've been holding these all this time?\" Chance replies, \"Been waiting till they fit you again\".Rio Bravo is also an exploration of what bravery is. Again, there are the obvious scenes of bravery involving Chance, Dude and Colorado. But there is also the scene, for instance, of Feathers, sitting in a chair asleep in the morning--outside of Chance's bedroom at the hotel. She has obviously been \"standing guard\" all night. Chance exasperatedly chides her for this, but her bravery is undeniable and touching But most of all, I think that Rio Bravo is an exploration of friendship, and what it can mean for us to have a friend by our side, through it all, no matter what.As a young boy, watching this movie years ago on the big screen, it had a profound effect on me. Like Mia Farrow in Woody Allen's The Purple Rose of Cairo, I felt like I was transported into the screen. Whenever I watch Rio Bravo, it still has the same impact for me.I can't say that about too many other movies.",

If you're a fan of John Wayne, then THIS is the perfect film for you. Wayne is effortless in his portrayal of the movie's hero Sheriff John T. Chance. He was so natural in Westerns, born to play in them. No matter how challenging or different the role, Wayne always thrived in Westerns. And he rarely played the same character, which is ironic since many thought he was typecast as the Western hero. You're telling me that the heroic everyman John T. Chance is the same as the disturbed, racist Ethan Edwards (THE SEARCHERS) or the stubborn pioneer John Dunston (RED RIVER)? I don't think so. And Mr. Wayne played all these challenging roles with amazing accuracy and aplomb. The man could act! I've seen some say that this role for Wayne was 'easy' for him b/c he just got to play himself. One thing is for sure: Wayne completely carries this long film from start to finish! The characters are what drive RIO BRAVO. The plot isn't so much important. But Chance is holding local thug and killer Joe Burdett (effectively played by Claude Akins) in jail while waiting for the territory marshal to pick him up. All the help Chance has are his 2 deputies Dude (brilliantly played by Dean Martin) and Stumpy (the funny Walter Brennan). Special mention should go to Martin, who has to have given the best performance of his career in this film. He realistically relays the role of the alcoholic who is truly trying to change. It's actually amazing that they put such a powerful topic in a film like this, but it completely works. Also, Martin is NOT a supporting character in this film. He is essentially the second lead next to Wayne.Brennan is as usual a card as Wayne's sidekick. Also in supporting roles are Angie Dickinson and Ricky Nelson, who are both a little immature for their roles, but still both do a fine job with what they are given to work with. Main kudos go to Wayne and Martin in the acting department. The director Howard Hawks creates a special, isolated world in this tiny Texas burg. The dialogue is especially simple, but yet situations and characters are so well-defined, you almost feel like you are spying in on this world, rather than watching a 'movie'.",

In \"High Noon\" because the rogue was trapped by the Marshal of the town and was recently released.

In \"High Noon\" the Marshal is looking for help in vain and is on his own in his struggle against the criminal. \"High Noon\" is in essence a very pessimistic film. Too pessimistic in the opinion of the makers of \"Rio Bravo\", especially lead actor John Wayne, and they made a more heroic Western in which the Sheriff does get help from different people.In my opinion \"High Noon\" is the better film, but \"Rio Bravo\" is not bad either. It was the come back film of Howard Hawks, after (the failure of) \"Land of the Pharaos\" (1955), and he proved that he had not forget his trade. The emphasis on the film is not on the battle with the criminals (although the shootout is spectacular ebough) , but on the dynamics in the inner circle of the Sheriff.The centre of the inner circle is of course Sheriff John T. Chance hilmself, a subdued and remarkable \"un-tough\" role of John Wayne. Dean Martin plays his assistent who has problems with the bottle. Walter Brennan (winning in his career three Oscars for best supporting actor) plays old Stumpy. He is the comic relief of the movie and his humour is well dosed. Ricky Nelson, at that time a rival of Elvis Presley, plays the overconfident boy. Of course he gets his own song in the movie to promote himself. Most striking in this inner circle is the young Angie Dickinson as \"Feathers\", the love interest of John T. Chance.

Never mind, \"Rio Bravo\" does not strive for authenticity, just rousing fun.The three western veterans that head the cast, Wayne, Brennan, and Bond, have performed in so many horse operas that the dust of the open plains is lodged in their lungs. Although Dean Martin's slick image initially works against him, he tries hard and eventually convinces the audience that, even if he does not fit the image of a gunslinger, he is a fine sensitive actor, when given the chance. Unfortunately, one singer was not enough for Hawks, and he evidently hired Ricky Nelson to attract teenage girls to the film. Whatever Ricky Nelson was, a sharp shooting gunman he was not. His acting skills were honed on \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet,\" and they do not carry him here against heavyweights such as Wayne and Brennan. His voice and American Bandstand haircut are 1950's New Jersey, not 1880's frontier. Although Angie Dickinson is also coiffed out of period, she does well as the leading lady, who inexplicably pursues Wayne. Why the leggy twenty-something would overlook the dark good looks of Martin or the baby face of Nelson for craggy middle-aged Wayne is one of the plot's deeper mysteries.At 141 minutes, \"Rio Bravo\" runs long, and the aforementioned crooning scene could have been judiciously trimmed, although the teenyboppers would have likely protested. Tightening the scenes between Wayne and Dickinson would not have hurt either. Her coy come-ons to the fatherly Wayne are not convincing in any case. However, despite the quibbles, \"Rio Bravo\" will satisfy most with its humor, genial performances, classic good-guys-versus-bad-guys storyline, gunfights, fistfights, and male bonding. And, yes, even Martin's mellow voice and Nelson's guitar plucking are pleasant diversions. However, \"Rio Bravo\" does not depict how the west was really won. Gunshots are bloodless, hotel rooms are freshly painted, and women play poker with the guys. Perhaps, \"Rio Bravo\" shows how the west should have been.",

            "content": "\"On one side is an army of gunmen dead-set on springing a murderous cohort from jail. On the other is Sheriff John T. Chance (John Wayne) and his two deputies: one a recovering drunkard (Dean Martin), the other a crippled codger (Walter Brennan). Also in their ragtag ranks are an unseasoned, trigger-happy youth (Ricky Nelson) and a woman with a past (Angie Dickinson) - and her eye on Chance. Director Howard Hawks lifted the Western to new heights with 'Red River'. Capturing the legendary West with a stellar cast in peak form, he does it again here,\" according to the Special Edition DVD description.Mr. Hawks' \"Red River\" is in a class of its own, and though \"Rio Bravo\" does not approach the heights promised by the above comparison, it's still an excellent film. Hawks goes off on some tangents, but they're worth watching; it's not really that \"Rio Bravo\" is too long, but that some of its length seems not to add much. Interesting, too, is how Mr. Wayne further develops his persona under Hawks' direction. Perhaps unexpectedly, Mr. Martin excels in a dramatic role which seems written for him. Mr. Nelson exudes youthful sex appeal like few other teen idols. There is certainly a lot of charisma on screen.Martin and Nelson were both very successful in another field, and you'll hear a sample. Johnny Cash wrote a superb song for Rick to sing in this film, which appeared on his \"Ricky Sings Again\" LP and was the lead track of a hit EP. A listen to the song \"Restless Kid\" will reveal why it wasn't included. It couldn't be a title song since it is about Nelson's \"Colorado\" character exclusively. And if inserted where Nelson and Martin sing a couple of folksy tunes, \"Restless Kid\" would have stopped the show. Come to think about it, that might not have been a bad idea. Still, see \"Rio Bravo\" for some iconic performances.******** Rio Bravo (3/18/59) Howard Hawks ~ John Wayne, Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, Angie Dickinson",

He hires a town drunk to be his deputy and an old man to protect his jail. When he arrest a local bandit and is waiting for national authorities to come get him, time is not on his side as the gang will try to breakout their arrested friend. A love interest and young cowboy joins the band of misfits to help the sheriff.This movie is directed by Howard Hawks (The Big Sleep) and stars John Wayne (True Grit), Dean Martin (The Silencers), Angie Dickinson (Point Blank), Walter Brennan (To Have and Have Not), Estelita Rodriguez (The Golden Stallion), Claude Akins (Battle for Planet of the Apes) and Ricky Nelson (The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet).This movie has some fantastic characters that make it an absolute must see. Dean Martin was an entertaining and unpredictable character. Angie Dickinson was smoking hot. The hotel scenes were always fun and of course Wayne was a great main character. The old man was also hilarious, especially the scenes were he shot at, or almost shot at, various characters.

Helping out our hero is a sobering-up deputy (Dean Martin), an old cripple (Walter Brennan) and an eager young gunfighter (Rick Nelson). Angie Dickinson is also hanging around to get under Wayne's skin and look gorgeous for the camera.It's an epic revenge oater with lenty of buildup and a legendary shootout to cap things off.

The sheriff only has an old galoot named Stumpy (Walter Brennan) and a drunken deputy (Dean Martin) to help him. Most of the action is saved for the big showdown at the end. Much of the rest of the movie is a character study. Hardly Howard Hawks' best work, but worth a look. Martin disappears from a sizable segment of the story, supposedly because he runs off for a time. Once he returns, the movie seems oddly disjointed, and I have no idea what might have happened. A virtually unrecognizable Angie Dickinson is on hand as a troubled woman who falls for Big John, and a teenaged Ricky Nelson plays a Billy the Kid type who eventually sides with the good guys. .

            "review_title": "Bravo, Mr. Hawks for this tale of pure bravado filled with so many bravura performances...",
            "content": "\"High Noon\" is one of my all-time favorite westerns and I really believed a film couldn't be the antithesis of a masterpiece and a masterpiece. I was a fool and \"Rio Bravo\" was a fantastic experience.I can't recall one scene that didn't grab me or touch me or made me laugh or smile. The acting and writing blended into a flawless story, smoothly directed by Howard Hawks at the top of his game. Each episode enriches the psychology of the characters -villains included- exploring every Western trope while deviating from the tiresome norms... and basically retelling the \"High Noon\" story with a new angle. A successful one.It's common knowledge that Hawks loathed \"High Noon\" because of its portrayal of a marshal asking townspeople to help him, a move he deemed as unprofessional. Wayne didn't beat around the bush and called it \"un-American\". Whether the two were right or wrong is irrelevant, Hawks applied the 'Godard' principle: the best way to criticize a film is to make one. After \"Rio Bravo\", I finally could hear what he and Wayne kept saying.Now, \"Rio Bravo\" doesn't open with a catchy ballad like its rival but its opening is nonetheless brilliant by pure cinematic standards. No words spoken for five minutes. Dean Martin enters the bar, his eye language suggests a lost man at the verge of breaking down. We gather he needs a fuel. He's Dude and Martin's acting was so incredible I hardly recognized the glamorous singer. A man, Joe Burdette (Claude Atkins) asks him if it's about drinking -no words spoken again- Dude nods, Joe throws a coin in the spittoon. Dude kneels down to take it but is stopped by a Winchester, the extension of a body that can only belong to one man: John Wayne. He shakes his head and kick the vase out of Dude's reach.Dimitri Tiomkin's music that has followed the action rhythm like in old silent films, goes crescendo as violence escalates. Dude knocks the Duke down, a fight ensues and a man who tried to interfere is brutally shot by Joe. The ruthless killer goes to another saloon where he's finally arrested by Sherif Chance (Wayne) with Dude's help. Je is taken to the jail where we meet Stumpy, the two-teeth limping deputy played by the unique Walter Brennan, the actor who always seems in his element when he plays supporting comedic characters. And that's it, in a school-case of minimalist directing we get half the cast established and whole set-up. Joe's got a brother and many supporters in town. Until he's taken to the marshal, surveillance is needed, it's the \"High Noon\" situation stretched for days.The plot builds up to the part where an old friend of Chance, Ward Bond in his final role, offers his help but Chance dismisses it: men are paid to free Burdette, why would he make widows or orphans for such a worthless sacrifice? (A subtle \"Take That\" to \"High Noon\") Then there's Ricky Nelson as Colorado Ryan, one of Bond's employees. Nelson is as believable a cowboy as if they had cast Elvis instead, but he is just as cool as James Coburn in \"The Magnificent Seven\". When Wayne talks about him in his presence, Ryan says \"I understand English, you can ask me\", and when offered the chance to help, he'd rather \"mind his own business\", this is not cowardice, but pragmatism.And Chance admires a man so capable he doesn't feel like proving it. In a film where even the little Mexican hotel owner Carlos (Pedro Rodriguez) ends up proving he's more than a comic relief, we get the point: men you can count on need no \"calling\", if you need them, they will come. And as if the story wasn't multilayered enough, and to spice it up with a romance with the Duke, Hawks gratifies us with one strong female character played by Angie Dickinson. The beautiful and flirtatious Feathers knows she's dealing with a poker-faced man, one of few words; and so she carefully chooses hers, loading them with the right amount of wit and sexual innuendo. The dialogue between Dickinson and Wayne, reminded me of Hawks' laws of attraction in his screwball classics and movies like \"To Have and Have Not\" or \"The Big Sleep\". Wayne never makes the moves, but gives enough rope to be reached little by little, not good at acting but at reacting.Indeed, I praised Dean Martin's acting not just because of the poignantly sinuous road of his redemption or his total insecurity, but also because it inspired the best of Wayne's reacting skills. Don't let his seeming expressionlessness fool you: the trick with Wayne is to never show that he's scared or worried while allowing the attentive viewers to sense a certain vulnerability. \"Rio Bravo\" is full of subtle moments, generally silent, that'd make you believe this one of the Duke's best performances... also one where he can gives a big kiss to Brennan's head before getting kicked with a broom. You never get too much sentimental.Now, to the villains: they're not the one-dimensional ominous-looking trigger-happy thugs: Joe's brother (John Russel) tries to lay the diplomatic card while maneuvering in the shadows. But as Chance warns him, if something ever goes wrong, his sibling might be \"accidentally\" shot before anyone frees him, Stumpy approves with a glee that shows that they mean business. And what if things escalate? It wouldn't matter, they'll all be dead. The arrogance is calculated but pays off in the way it makes the enemy equally cautious and ingenuous and the whole confrontation a little more a battle of guns. In fact, everything in \"Rio Bravo\" is a little more than what you'd expect ... and if I concluded my \"High Noon\" review saying \"with all due respect, Mr. Hawks, Wayne and Ebert, \"High Noon\" is perfect the way it is\". Let me add with the same due respect:\"So is \"Rio Bravo\".",

            "content": "Although this wasn't Howard Hawks final film, it almost certainly was his last great film, one that transcended the usual standards of the genre and used character study and dialog to overshadow action sequences. Supposedly the conservative response to High Noon, Hawks and star John Wayne have created a glorious tribute to the Old West, as well as gathering a great supporting cast to help along the way.Wayne is perfect here is John T. Chance, with his slow drawl delivery and gimpy walk, he resembles a man who has witnessed plenty of evil in this small town and just wished it would go away. He has to try and keep a man from being sprung from jail and his only help is an old cripple named Stumpy (Walter Brennan in a scene-stealing role), a recovering drunk named Dude (Dean Martin in the best role of the film), and a quick, young sharpshooter named Colorado Ryan (Ricky Nelson in a very fine performance). All the elements come together here along with the strong writing which allows for the characters to embrace their own situations and work to resolve the one they are all in. The first hour or so simply sets up the background: Chance is the longtime sheriff, Dude is struggling to stay off the sauce, and a woman gets off the coach and immediately starts up a relationship with Chance.In another director's hands, this would be all action leading up to one final explosive scene. Here, action is minimal and used sparingly, so when the final action scene does come it is not only expected but exciting and satisfying. As I mentioned before, I though Dean Martin's performance was Oscar-worthy as a former drunk with plenty of problems, but realizes he needs to fix this one. It is such a great work of sympathy and desperation, you just feel for this guy and hope that he gets it all worked out. Certainly not the best Western I've ever seen, but this one works in Hawks' famous definition of a good movie: three great scenes, no bad ones. It was never more evident here.",

Especially Duke and Angie seem to be standing in different countries in their scenes together. A roster of talent doing one-person shows. None of the characters appears to have a life beyond the immediate scene, and the clich\u00e9d dialog does little to advance the story. It seems to me that Hawks would have been better off taking this outing to the beach. It's beyond the viewer what the Wayne and Nelson characters are doing in the same room together.",

It found every involved artist in a top form: The actors, off course a giant performance of the Duke, impressive acting of Ricky Nelson and Angie Dickinson, Dean Martin at it's best as the drunken deputy and a wonderful Walter Brennan as the grumbling and slandering old sidekick Stumpy; Hawks intelligent and calm directing; the perfect dramatic and humorous script from Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett; Russell Harlans indoor-photography; and at least the powerful music score from Dimitri Tiomkin, who did his best job since \"High Noon\", the Western which made Hawks so angry that he filmed \"Rio Bravo\".

Along with that, my favorite director Howard Hawks directs with unbelievable precision and compassion which was shown through this film unbelievably likable characters. Amazingly Ricky Nelson and Dean Martin pull out fantastic performances, which can be attributed to Hawks' direction.Beyond that this film includes everything that people love about westerns.

            "content": "So if you were going to make a western, you'd perhaps compile a list of ingredients, or components, that you think will help to make your film a classic.Your thoughts might go like this: \"First we need to have a boring, unrealistic romance between a 50-something year-old guy and a 20-something year-old girl. And we need to make sure that it takes up a lot of time in the bloated 140 minute production. Because nothing screams 'great western' like an unnecessary, unconvincing romance! Heck yeah we need that!\"\"Let's see, what else....we should get some young musician who can't act very well and stick him in the film. And have him sing a song or two, songs that don't sound very vintage to the 19th century old west. This is a MUST to make a great western!\"\"Hmm...and let's have some comic relief. Let's have this old guy walk around and complain and gripe about everything under the sun, because that's funny, right? And let's make his voice so annoying that it grates on your nerves, to the point where you're hoping somebody, anybody, kills this character off. Gotta have that or it's not a great western.\"\"The plot has to be inanely stupid. The bad guys are all around town but they don't do very much. They just watch you. They are willing to kill the good guys sometimes, but other times they just stand around and watch. Until the end of the film, then they are willing to kill the good guys again. We need to drag this out for a long time because our film is going to be really long and really slow and have as little action as possible until the last 20 minutes. This will make a great western.\"I could go on, but the point is made. A film with this many negatives simply cannot be great, despite what others might say. Rio Bravo is pretty weak all things considered. When I am in the mood for a western, I will never, EVER think of watching this again.6/10. Extremely slow-burn of an 'action' film that is little more than mediocre or average. Multiple negatives that cannot be ignored saddle it with -4 stars off the top.Would I watch again (Y/N)?: As I mentioned above, not very likely. I would watch 'The Magnificent Seven' 100 times straight before I watched Rio Bravo again.",

            "content": "John Wayne famously said that the events depicted in HIGH NOON (US 1952) could never have happened in a US town, and in 1959 he jumped at the chance to do a Western with Howard Hawks showing how the people of a town under siege do not abandon their lawman.I happen to believe that the events in HIGH NOON could have happened anywhere in the world. In addition, I have never rated John Wayne a good actor, but in this film he fares better than usual. He's still the ever dominant macho, he gets the beautful girl in the end, but this time he has some respect for the three souls helping him out of a tough situation: Dean Martin, Walter Brennan and Ricky Nelson.Dean Martin, also a limited actor, posts his best performance ever in this film. He plays a drunkard, and a has-been pistol wizard on the comeback trail by containing his booze intake, and taking on the role of deputy sheriff.Ricky Nelson embodies the growing importance of youth in the movies in the 1950s - he actually has the temerity to stand up to Wayne and earns the latter's respect in the process!Angie Dickinson, then in the middle of affairs with the Kennedy brothers, is beautiful beyond words. I don't think any man could ignore such beauty, especially when she is in her undergarments at the end of the movie.But it is the wonderful Walter Brennan who steals the show as Stumpy, a cripple with a squeaky voice, and a spirited hoot of a laugh. Brennan is, of course, the only actor to have won three supporting actor Oscars so far (Daniel Day-Lewis won three Best Actor Oscars, Jack Nicholson two Best Actor and one Supporting Actor Oscars).Hawks' direction is fantastic, as is the photography.The reason I do not give RIO BRAVO 10/10 is the script. It is impossible to believe that Wayne, Nelson and Martin can walk around so carelessly in a town supposedly under siege from Burdette, a criminal seeking to remove his brother from jail, together with his band of henchmen. And that finale with Wayne and Martin shooting sticks of dynamite in the air really made me suspend all my disbelief, fun as it was to watch...In the final analysis, RIO BRAVO is good fun, and its self-deprecating humor is its loftiest quality, along with a terrific soundtrack, the cherry of which is the duet by Martin and Nelson - both great singers, then at the top of their considerable crooning powers.Definitely must-see if you like Westerns.",

            "content": "The Wikipedia entry for this film declares it a masterpiece. It's certainly a classic: Howard Hawks directed, John Wayne starred, Dmitri Tiomkin wrote the music, and Leigh Brackett (The Big Sleep) wrote the script. It delivers a classic Western scenario: a sheriff and his sidekicks facing down a town full of villainous henchmen while they await the arrival of a federal marshal. Quentin Tarrantino claims it's his favorite movie; John Carpenter likes it too, and his \"Assault on Precinct 13\" is just one of the films influenced by \"Rio Bravo\".John Wayne stars as the sheriff, John T. Chance, and his trusty Winchester costars. There's not much that can rile Chance, perhaps because Wayne had reached a point in his career when he wasn't expected to act. Dean Martin plays Dude (not THE Dude), a recovering drunkard, crooner, and former deputy. Ricky Nelson, who takes his emotive cues from Wayne, plays a young gunslinger (perhaps descended from Cherry Valance of \"Red River\") along for the ride. Walter Brennan plays himself, and Angie Dickenson plays a neurotic young woman who falls for Chance.There are occasional gunfights, and an explosive climax, most of which are incidental to the plot. The movie is so relaxed in its pacing, and the lead performances are so restrained, that there is hardly any real suspense or tension. The bad guys who pop up now and then fail to threaten our heroes, and they are quickly despatched. The main villain doesn't make much of an impact. On its surface, \"Rio Bravo\" is hardly comparable to other Western Classics like \"The Gunfighter\" or \"High Noon\". What makes the movie stand out, and perhaps what gives it classic status, is the easy rapport of its characters and the bantering dialogue that was Hawks' trademark. It was apparently a political response to \"High Noon\" -- a similar story told the \"right\" way -- but the movie is so chilled out that it's almost impossible to read any sort of political subtext into it. It's just a fun movie.",

It also began to set the habit of John Wayne using popular young entertainers in their early acting roles, as well as beginning to build the second tier of his stable of screen regulars. Dean Martin is excellent as the recovering drunk \"Dude.\" You really feel his struggle to get over his alcoholism in the course of this film. And Walter Brennan as \"Stumpy\" was as always great. Another excellent actor in this film, aside from Ward Bond, a regular in 22 of John Wayne's films (this was their final parring) was John Russell as Nathan Burdette. Russell would later be seen in Clint Eastwood's film \"Pale Rider\" in 1984. And finally is Claude Akins, who just makes you hate him in this picture. As westerns go, this is often cited as one of the very best. Also a good beginning for the career of Angie Dickinson.",

            "content": "I had not seen El Dorado for several years but I had seen and enjoyed The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, The Alamo, and El Dorado's template, Rio Bravo several times. In a very concrete sense these are all the same movies, and could well be considered to be the godfather of the series, Deadwood. All the films include a very specific use of a broken down alcoholic, apparently not an unusual feature of the real Wild West, usually a good guy, or like in Liberty Valance, Lee Marvin, a quintessential bad guy, or as in the Alamo, well they were all drunks there apparently. John Wayne, a fine if underrated actor, of course sets the pace in all these films, even when surrounded by such excellent actors like Jimmy Stewart, Richard Widmark,Lee Marvin, Ed Asner, Woody Strode, Dean Martin, Robert Mitchum, and Walter Brennan. These movies were morality plays in the finest sense of that genre. We all know that the good gunfighters, led by Big John, will save the day, except at the Alamo where only honor was won, and they will save the day against insurmountable, almost unbelievable odds, but the action and the acting is so extraordinarily convincing that we suspend our cynicism and eagerly and breathlessly follow the action. Unfortunately, the bad gunfighters, and their leaders, are all too one dimensional, so thoroughly evil that the viewer practically prays for their demise. But except in the case of Lee Marvin's portrayal of Liberty Valance, even Ed Asner, or Claude Akins, or Santa Anna had some good qualities, or were at least fighting for a cause of some sort. It might have been more interesting, at least, to show these men as characters and not just cardboard cutouts. In the end, however, all these movies stand out from the many badly done and sadly done westerns were made around the same time. My personal belief is that John Wayne is the main reason. His drawl, his understated and yet strong, manly, and courteous character, and his exemplary behavior both on and off the screen is what made and makes him an enduring role model, and real Hollywood star, even now in our jaded and tawdry times.",

I think she ( along with Walter Brennan as Stumpy) steals the picture. Here is something;':. It is a fact about John Wayne, that after he became a star, very few women got the best of him: They were Claudette Colbert, Gail Russell, Jean Arthur, Capucine, Elsa Martinelli and Angie. Feathers wins over John T. Chance ( Wayne) by proving him wrong when he thinks she is a card cheat, and by doing what is necessary for him. How: Sleeping in a chair outside his door so he can sleep and she was going to take on gunmen holding him hostage until Colorado ( Ricky Nelson) had her throw out a flower pot to distract them. It was her willingness to go save Chance that inspired Colorado. Spoilers ahead: The final scene with her in tights was classic, with Chance saying \"He will arrest her\" if she goes out in public and finally admits that he will be the only one to see her in the tights. Her response was about making him talk as she said \"You will have to.\" She knew then they were getting married. It is interesting that of all the women on that list the only one who changed him more was Russell in 'Angel And The Bad Man' I know everyone in Rio Bravo is great ( especially Brennan), and it is an easy 10/10 classic but watch the scenes with Feathers they are the best in the movie.",

            "content": "It is almost impossible to talk about this movie without talking about other movies as well. First, there are the comparisons to other movies previously directed or produced by Howard Hawks, such as \"To Have and Have Not\" (1944) and \"The Thing from Another World\" (1951); as well as two of his subsequent Westerns, \"El Dorado\" (1966) and \"Rio Lobo\" (1970), each of which also stars John Wayne.Then there is \"High Noon\" (1952), which Hawks disliked so much on account of the way Marshall Kane (Gary Cooper) goes around asking ordinary citizens for help and finally has to be saved by his Quaker wife that he made \"Rio Bravo\" in response, in which Sheriff Chance only wants professionals to help him. But whereas \"High Noon\" is grim, \"Rio Bravo\" is lighthearted, with many scenes played for laughs, and with a scene in which the good guys sing a couple of cute songs. Had Hawks not explicitly made the comparison of his movie to \"High Noon,\" I would never have noticed, for the plot is quite different as well.Then there is \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence\" (1962), directed by John Ford, who apparently did not approve of what happened in \"Rio Bravo.\" In \"Rio Bravo,\" the humiliating spittoon scene in the beginning leads to someone getting shot; in \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence,\" when Valence (Lee Marvin) trips Stoddard (James Stewart), which leads to a confrontation with Doniphon (John Wayne), Stoddard defuses the situation and nothing bad happens.Then there is \"Assault on Precinct 13\" (1976), which has a similar story, although it is not a western.Then there is \"A Fistful of Dollars\" (1964). Director Sergio Leone told composer Ennio Morricone that he wanted the music in his movie to be like the \"Deguello\" played in \"Rio Bravo.\"That much I learned from reading reviews of film critics. But one comparison that occurs to me is \"North to Alaska\" (1960), also starring John Wayne, but, more importantly, starring Fabian. Fabian is a rock 'n' roll singer like Ricky Nelson, but a much better actor. I would have preferred to have him cast as Colorado in \"Rio Bravo,\" and he could have sung along with Dean Martin.Another performance in the movie that I did not care for was that of Angie Dickenson as Feathers. If \"Rio Bravo\" were the only movie I had ever seen her in, I would think she was a bad actress. But her acting in other movies is fine, so the fault must be with the role that was handed to her. It comes across as forced and artificial. In fact, now that I think about it, maybe Ricky Nelson was not to blame for his performance as Colorado either.Despite these weak performances, and despite a weak plot that does not always make sense, it nevertheless all adds up to a pretty good movie. It's not as good as \"High Noon\" though.",

Co-character Stumpy is perhaps the star of the film, his hillbilly rants making for some funny scenes. The film builds in tension very effectively before things all erupt at the end. The closing shootout is well paced and enjoyable, Wayne's shotgun seeing plenty of action. The film is certainly dated, but is still fun to watch. The Spaghetti westerns of the 60s make it look tame, but viewed on its own merits its a fine film. Wayne has an undeniable screen presence, he really is an A-lister, and much better than today's dull offerings. Rio Bravo ranks alongside the Shootist as his premier movie, I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in cinema.",

Overall I'm not a big fan of the Western genre itself but some of my favourite films of all time are Westerns and my favourite Western (and one of my favourite films ever) is Rio Bravo, the main reason is without a doubt the performances, they are phenomenal and so likeable and the chemistry of the group is so great that after the movie ends I just want to spend more time with Dude, Stumpy, Colorado and the Sheriff. The story is interesting and while the moments of action are fewer then in most Westerns I really like each one of them, but even without much action the film is still very entertaing and funny because of the interactions of these great characters, in fact my favourite scene might be when the group is just relaxing and singing.\nOverall, the film is probably not quite the greatest Western of all time but it's surely a runner-up for that spot and the most entertaining movie of the genre that I've watched.\n9.8/10",

            "content": "Of all the westerns John Wayne made, some of his later work was pretty high on the entertainment scale, but not necessarily having much substance. \"Rio Bravo\" may be the best example of the Duke standing vigourously, surrounded by a group of likable cronies, against the odds. I say standing because that is all that was required of him by this point in his career, and that is almost exactly what we see.As to the story, Sheriff John Chance (Wayne) has the task of seeing a murder suspect \u2013 well, not really much of a suspect, we see him do it \u2013 is held until a trial can be held. His accomplices are Dude (Dean Martin), a souse that was once a solid citizen and handy with a gun; a rookie called Colorado (Ricky Nelson) who is quick on the draw and coolly capable; an old-timer going by the name of Stumpy (Walter Brennan) and what seems an afterthought, the stage passenger that stayed in town \u2013 Feathers (Angie Dickinson).The trials and tribulations this ensemble sallies against is formidable. The prisoner is the brother of a powerful local rancher, so there is every possibility of an abetted escape attempt. To that end hired guns begin to cause mayhem in town, so there is never a peaceful moment.This is all western fun at its best. No one would expect high art here, but there is plenty of action (not compared to the latest chase movies, honest) but there is a story that one want to see through.I have heard and read that this movie was Howard Hawks' answer to \"High Noon\". There is much documentation to the effect that Wayne hated \"High Noon\" as well. Well, I like this movie much better than the overrated \"High Noon\" - there's are an awful lot of uneventful moments with only some pretty good action at the end. At least in \"Rio Bravo\" situations occur with some regularity.At this point in his career Wayne was commanding big salaries and darned if he didn't deserve it. His mere presence was box office gold, and the studios knew it. The Duke worked quite hard to preserve his image and this is another example of how he carefully nurtured \"the brand\" \u2013 he may even have been king of the G-rated movies.Three Stars.",

It was so successful that a remake was made under the title of \"Rio Lobo\". I particularly enjoy some of the film-making liberties taken in many of the western movies, not exclusive to John Wayne's. Just a little tip to Wayne fans: look at the background and if you see a saguaro cactus, IT AIN'T Texas! Saguaros only grow in western New Mexico, Arizona, and the north of the Sonoran desert of Mexico. Many of Wayne's (and others) films were filmed in or around what is called \"old Tucson\" which is located roughly 20 miles south of Tucson, Arizona. It was built (and remains) a movie set and is one of the most interesting sites to visit by tourists. I have been there many times and rather than detracting from the movie it only adds to the ambiance of seeing where it was filmed. The main point is: ENJOY a classical excellent western!",

            "content": "\"Rio Bravo\" must be one of the most over-rated Westerns ever. The story as presented is suitable for a TV show, and so are the sets, the lighting and the direction. Much has been made of its \"tight story construction\" and that Hawks made it to refute \"High Noon\" (he was right to do so), but take away Dean Martin's and Angie Dickinson's sub-plots and the story arc, a series of repetitious action sequences that lead up to a predictable climax, is flatter than the Texas horizon.I believe this film really marks the beginning of the end for its two collaborators - Wayne and Hawks. John Wayne in particular, who could be very good in the right role - think of \"Red River\" and Ford's \"The Searchers\" only three years before \"Rio Bravo\" - shows the first signs of acting laziness that would degrade into self-parody over the coming years.  He carries his role through the power of his screen presence, which was considerable, but there's little acting there, (or re-acting, Wayne's preferred acting method). He has no connection with the Angie Dickinson character, the absurdly named Feathers, and the resolution of their love story sub-plot is embarrassing and obvious.  Miss Dickinson tries hard with an out of date character type that Hawks over-employed in his films - the girl who's really one of the boys.  Their scenes together look like early rehearsals.Other roles are capably handled by solid character actors like Walter Brennan, Claude Akins and Ward Bond. There are near cameos by Bob Steele and Harry Carey Jr. Dean Martin as Dude comes off best in the film.  In danger of fading away after the break up with Jerry Lewis (and perhaps feeling the hot breath of the great Duke Mitchell on his neck), he needed to establish himself as a solo performer and thus confounded his critics by demonstrating that he could act, just as Ricky Nelson confounded no one by demonstrating that he could not. Interestingly, it has been rumored for years that Elvis was originally offered the role of Colorado but Colonel Parker wouldn't let him take it. At any rate, Martin is quite good mainly because he has the meatiest role; his is the only character that changes.  Other than Dude and anybody who gets killed off, no one is changed by the experience of the story. Well OK, John Wayne falls in love, but who do you think will do the changing in that relationship?As for Howard Hawks, I see nothing in his handling of this film that I haven't seen in other Hawks films. This can of course be said of Ford and other older directors, but the entire production looks tired and uninteresting. I have watched Rio Bravo many times and must admit its easy to get pulled into the story, but still, I remain mystified by its allure because in the end its a disappointing experience.  The fact that one can tune in at any point in the plot and follow along, is, to me, not evidence of classic structure, but a sad indication of its fundamental shallowness.",

John Wayne is his characteristically rough self, caring but rough-hewn as always in this movie who story line is simple: A spoiled outlaw (even at circa thirty years of age) is arrested for murder, and his older rich brother comes to the small Texas town of Rio Bravo to get him out: naturally, he brings his own hired guns to help him accomplish his purpose. Nothing but chaos ensues: there are a few gunfights and a dynamite explosion. The cast was somewhat stellar: again, Wayne was his rough self, Dean Martin (as Robert Mitchum did in El Dorado) posed well as a pathetic drunk who did sober himself up, Angie Dickinson was a very pretty unhappy lady, Rick Nelson was a baby-faced yet very brave deputy, Ward Bond too was his typical rough, boisterous self. Claude Akins performed very well a spoiled,mean outlaw, John Russell acted well in his role as the cold, crooked brother of Claude Akins. The town was pretty though very rough-looking; though Rio Bravo was actually a Texas town, the movie was actually filmed in Arizona at the Old Tuscon movie sight, as were many other classic westerns. Though, again it was long, the movie was not a sleeper. The well-known Howard Hawks was his same excellent director self, and Dimitri Tiomkin, who practically set a standard for directing music, was still very capable in this movie.

            "content": "A simple case: The good have arrested a bad and entrench themselves in the prison. The to and from is unimportant - what counts is this very moment where the time seems to stand still: four men in a room who are sitting together and sleek their wounds. And they act as if there's nothing more important than their mankind. And then they sing a song which is called \"My Pony, My Rifle and Me\" all right, but - of course - tells from the desire to spend some quiet minutes with a \"sweet girl companion\". In a certain way, this is the natural distance which Hollywood has put between men and women. First, there are the men, then there's the desire - and finally the women take their place who actually and undoubtedly hold the reins. This is the story that always swirls through the minds of men - and sometimes has to be cryptically sung out loud - about the better, invisible half of the story of Rio Bravo. Here, we see Dude (Dean Martin) who had an unpleasant experience with a woman; Chance (John Wayne) who is close to have one in the future; Stumpy (Walter Brennan) who is too old for such things and Colorado (Ricky Nelson) who is still too young. Those are four good reasons for limiting the contact with women to a song which circles around horses and rifles, but actually means That.So, the second, visible half of the story tells from four men in a room - and it would have been only half as beautiful without the short screen offs between the cuts. It is about friendship, responsibility, alcohol and all the things that men just have to worry with. Dude started drinking - they say, because of a woman - and therefor is not the old one anymore. His old friend Chance watched this for too long now, and decided at one point that this man is beyond help. That's why he puts his trust into the young newbie Colorado and wants him to be his next deputy. From now on, Chance finds, Dude can drink as much as he wants - he doesn't care anymore. But exactly this wins Dude over to stop and to pour the whisky in the glass back into the bottle - without spilling one drop. He says that a Mexican tune has brought him back to life, but it was, of course, Chance who said that the boy is at least as good as Dude. Anyway, the old Stumpy becomes so deranged from this whirl that he indulges in taking a big slug.Screen off.The four men are still surrounded by the bad guys, but no situation is as serious when a song at the right time can provide some comfort. Dude lies on a slapstick with the hat moved deep down his face and a cigarette in his mouth when he starts singing while Colorado sets in the guitar to \"My Pony, My Rifle and Me\". Stumpy obviously has his fun and Chance grins pleasantly. Now, Colorado sings his part and Dude whistles to it. And afterwards, they throw in \"Get Along Home, Cindy, Cindy\" which Stumpy knows as well and lilts with them. And Chance, drinking his coffee out of a dented metal cup, puts on his most fatherly face. Before, the world was in pieces, but now, everything is put together again. From now on, you know that nothing can go wrong anymore. One song is enough, nothing else needed. There is no fairer solution cinema has to offer.",

John Wayne in himself is that \"Type\". I don't think any actor before him or since has had such on screen command as \"The Duke\" did. Rio Bravo was just one of many of the examples of the John Wayne in action, who despite playing the role at 52 left no questions who the star was among a cast of stars.One thing that is quickly noticed is the broad range of ages of the stars in \"Rio Bravo\" and the good guys included as mentioned John Wayne at 52, Dean Martin at 42, Angie Dickinson at 28, Ricky Nelson at 19, and last but not least in the old \"spaghetti\" western style\u0085side kick Walter Brennan at 65. Maybe the cast was set that way to attract a broad base of fans or maybe it was just the way the story goes, I can't say.Now of the cast I'll go through it quickly. John Wayne was his same old self, great. Dean Martin did an impressive role and like Wayne was a pleasure to watch. Angie Dickinson, in short played the misunderstood hottie, personally I didn't think she added much but it let the viewers see the star (Wayne) had it really going on. Ricky Nelson was almost an annoyance around such greats as Wayne and Martin although his (Nelson's) part was woven into the story to much to do without. Then there is Walter Brennan, what can you say, great actor in an overdone all-be-it entertaining role.The film really is a case study in my opinion. You have the classic great in Wayne, Martin and Brennan. You toss in an attractive female. And I assume the theory was bring in the younger female viewers with Nelson giving Wayne and Martin might not do it at ages 52 and 42 respectively.By the way there were actually some bad guys in \"Rio Bravo\" but in the presence of the good guys it really didn't matter who they were.I last viewed \"Rio Bravo\" on the DVD and although there is no denying it is a 45 plus year old movie it was clear, clean and nice on the eyes but limited to mono sound.It really is a shame the western genre is all but dead. \"Rio Bravo\" shows that with Stars bigger than life there is more than an abundance of quality entertainment value. Maybe things are as they say everything goes in cycles, maybe one day we will have another dominant figure such as John Wayne have us eager to see outlaws, good-guys and the six gun shootouts.",

He knew how to act drunk and not just in his comedies, as this great film, by director Howard Hawks, shows. And, John Wayne, if you ignore the mannerisms, iconic look of him and just concentrate on the performance, you see he can really act. As Sheriff John T. Chance. He shows so much empathy when he watches his friend the Dude (Martin), struggle with his addiction. The pain in his face matches the pain that Martin expresses.Rio Bravo (1959), joins a list of late 1950s westerns, that look like they were moving towards the upcoming decade's more tougher, sophisticated, brutal, mature side of the content line. Remember, the MPAA would be established by the end of the 1960s. It was time for Rio Bravo (1959), to be made, because without that added grit to the equation, this film may not have been as good as it was. Check out the list of films released in 1959. You can see the changing tides moving towards an even more sophisticated type of Hollywood, relating to more mature content. Films like, North by Northwest (1959) Ben-Hur (1959) and FBI Story (1959), just to name a few.Hawks frames his shots in a way, that help highlight the mood of the scene. He always has Chance framed at a level higher than Angie Dickinson, who plays the love-interest Feathers, always keeping Wayne in the large dominant role. Wayne was pretty tall, so the framing was like that with most of the men too. Hawks needed to express Wayne's strength in his character. It shows the two different sides of Wayne's character and the two sides of this story. Those two sides being, Chance's involvement with Feathers and Chance's job as Sheriff, taking on the Burdette gang with the Dude. It is a good story, because while it gives you an exciting western clash, it also weaves this romantic story with a commentary on alcoholism. Oh, and Ward Bond notches another film on his belt. He was in everything in the 1950s. The cream of the crop is witnessing the combination of the great Dean Martin singing with Ricky Nelson as Colorado. They also get harmonica accompaniment from Walter Brennan as Stumpy. This film has it all.8.6 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",

And all this stoically played down by Gary Cooper In Rio Bravo we see a sheriff relaxedly played by the Duke, even refusing help that is offered to him (also he often puts himself in dire need of it) and going against a strong number of hired thugs with only a cripple and a drunkard. And we see a sexy love interest in Angie Dickinson who relentless provides help by throwing flower pots and not by pretending to be a quaker and then shooting people from behind. All this played out over more then 150 minutes without a really dull moment. And without denouncing \"normal people\" as cowards refusing solidarity, much more as people having their hearts and minds right, even to the expense of their life, as we experience the first one looking for organized help being killed by a paid hand.

            "content": "Some posters who dislike this movie are unable to separate John Wayne the actor from John Wayne's right wing politics, as if that had anything to do with his performances.Ironically, Wayne himself sought out Kirk Douglas for several of his movies despite Douglas's well known liberal sensibilities.Anyone who doesn't think Wayne was a fine actor should view some of his early westerns of the 1930's to see how carefully he developed his craft. You think John Wayne was always John Wayne? He invented his screen persona. He must have practiced that measured cadence of speech until he couldn't do it any other way because it just isn't there till the 1940's. His deliberate body language was also something he created. The 1930's John Wayne didn't seem to know what to do with his hands. Good acting is not just the ability to disappear chameleon-like into a part; good acting is playing your part so interesting or compelling enough that people will part with 2 hours of their lives to watch you. You think Wayne wasn't a good actor? How many actors could walk into a scene and command authority with their mere presence? Brando? Pacino? Deniro? Pitt? Rio Bravo is not a great John Wayne movie like \"Red River\" or \"The Searchers\". In those movies, Wayne is the whole show despite being surrounded by fine actors. Wayne isn't digging deep here. He playing a sheriff who's comfortable in his skin and his job and only seems unsure of himself when Angie Dickinson's around. The part requires authority, and Wayne displays it effortlessly. Rio Bravo is a great, enjoyable movie because Wayne, though still an important part of the movie, allows everyone else to upstage him in their scenes with him. Just look at one of the best scenes, the singing interlude in the jail-house. Wayne is the only one who doesn't sing; just lets his co-stars do what they do best and enjoys the moment.Dean Martin does the real acting here. He and Ricky Nelson also get to display their musical talent. Walter Brennan does the best Walter Brennan impression ever caught on film. Angie Dickinson; was this her first major role? She really sank her teeth into this one. She was brave, funny and sexy. Of the major actors, Ricky Nelson seemed a bit miscast. He's not bad; he just doesn't radiate the menace that you'd expect from a gunfighter. Steve McQueen or Burt Reynolds would have been better choices. Both were young, up and coming TV actors in 1959.Rio Bravo is not strictly a western; it's a character study that just happens to take place in a western setting. It resembles the old TV show Gunsmoke. You kind of wish there'd been a sequel.Other posters have mentioned that Howard Hawks and John Wayne made this in reaction to \"High Noon\". The big knock against \"High Noon\" is that in the old west, there is no case where a town showed cowardice in the face of gunmen. Quite the contrary. The Jesse James Gang and the Dalton Gang both came to an abrupt end when armed citizenry shot them to pieces. Settling in the old west was act of courage in itself and everyone was as familiar with a gun as with a shovel. In \"Rio Bravo\", every member of that town is brave and rallies behind the Sheriff. In that sense, \"Rio Bravo\" is more realistic than \"High Noon\".I'm not rating Rio Bravo a 10 because it's doesn't transcend the genre the way \"Shane\" or \"The Searchers\" did. It's just good entertainment and I watch it whenever it shows up.",

Despite my apprehension, I recently watched Rio Bravo, mostly to ascertain if my assumption was correct. I humbly admit that I was in error. I love Westerns, and Rio Bravo is one of the best. Ricky Nelson actually did a respectable job in his role and, to my pleasant surprise, Dean Martin showed some solid acting chops.

            "content": "There are some on here - IMDB - determined to rubbish what they see as nothing but brainless Fascist propaganda. They're just desperate to boost the ideologically contrived Leftist western 'High Noon' (which is nevertheless a very fine film, of course, from it's own particular perspective). One reviewer here is even determined to puncture the grandeur of the final shoot-out in 'Rio Bravo', by asserting in authoritative tones that 'I can assure you also that dynamite bars don't blow off when hit by a bullet.'Well, sorry , but dynamite sticks - they're not bars - are in actual fact extremely unstable. This is a characteristic of dynamite that Hawks and his writers efficiently indicate when Chance yells at Stumpy to get away quickly from the wagon he has chosen as a firing position, as the old man hasn't realised what lurks under the tarpaulin covering: a load of dynamite. One stray bullet could send the old-timer sky-high! He makes a hasty hobble to vamoose, but suddenly runs back and staggers away with a large case of useful extra armaments.This of itself provides sufficient dramatic logic for the 'explosive-skeet-shooting' scene that finally disposes of the villains, and plausibility is helped along by means of the clear indication in close-ups that no fuses have yet been fitted to these sticks, so that Stumpy must be fully aware of an alternative method of detonation, And indeed he is, and the others quickly catch on. We are enabled to rapidly gather during this fast-developing but clearly motivated scene that an unusual and decisive turn of events is unfolding. From that structural perspective alone the 'dynamite can't be detonated by a bullet' view is exposed as not only irrelevant but just plain ignorant.Such a view is also ignorant of the laws of chemistry and physics which have for long forbidden the use of dynamite for military purposes, having regard to the fact of it's extreme instability in such an environment rendering it more dangerous to your side than to the enemy. Even the professional demolition and mining uses of dynamite are subject to the most demanding controls, for that reason.In any case, an action-man like Hawks would be extremely unlikely not to have direct experience, with his second-unit, of the management and cinematic possibilities of explosives!Really the only question the scene raises is regarding the prowess of the shooters present; but of course all of these characters are already introduced to us as men who are long experienced in trusting their lives to the hair-trigger speed and pin-point accuracy demanded to survive as a gunfighter in an often lawless West.Well you can call that prowess myth or legend or history, but being an incredible crack-shot remains as essential to the Western genre as levitating chinese fighters in kung-fu movies; and anyway Hawks has a sufficient eye for pleasingly humanising detail to show the ageing Chance needing a second shot before successfully detonating one of the sticks Stumpy throws towards the baddies' by now burning redoubt.In fact this terrific scene usefully encapsulates precisely why this film is so satisfying, and so admired: style, and superb technique. The final shoot-out is resolved like a celebratory firework display, a clever contrivance true to the artifice of the Western genre and providing a glorious resolution for the long-suffering characters.Hawks clinches his magnificent film with the persuasiveness of dynamite.",

            "review_title": "Dean Martin Works",
            "content": "As the camera in the saloon swings to a low-angle shot and the orchestra strikes an ominous chord, the towering image of John Wayne fills the screen. Just as Wayne had presided over western pictures for thirty years (and would continue to do for more than another decade), veteran director Howard Hawks (Scarface, Red River) almost certainly intended Wayne to carry his 1959 Warner Brothers film Rio Bravo.Fortunately for us, however, Rio Bravo is not your archetypal John Wayne film.Co-star Dean Martin, as `Dude,' an alcoholic gunslinger struggling with sobriety, steals the screen in nearly every scene of Rio Bravo. Martin's potent mixture of innate coolness, vulnerability, and unflustered acting creates a dynamic and vibrant character that truly drives the unhurried emotional tenor of the film.Rio Bravo opens with Wayne's John T. Chance - a beefy cow-town sheriff with a resilient independent streak - in some considerable trouble. Joe Burdette, the rowdy black sheep brother of powerful rancher outlaw Nathan Burdette, is waiting in the city jail for extradition on murder charges; and the Burdette gang doesn't take too kindly to Chance's vision of court justice.While John T. is as obstinate and ageless as any John Wayne character, the supporting cast, led by Dean Martin's Dude, clearly sets Rio Bravo apart.Because of his stubborn self-reliance and his refusal to place his friends in danger by involving them in the violent situation, John T. relies on only two rag-tag deputies and a young-yet-wise gun-for-hire to protect the county of Presidio, Texas, and keep Burdette under lock and key until the U.S. Marshall arrives.Dean Martin's Dude is known by the local Mexicans as Borachon, or The Drunken One. Dude found his way into a bottle after his woman took off on a stagecoach, and two years later he seems to be in no better shape. Ridiculed by outlaws and cowboys alike, Dude has become a shell of his former sharp-shooting self.Conveniently, however, Dude turns the corner on his grief and alcoholism at just the right time. He joins forces with John T., an old friend and partner, and quickly regains his ability to dispense justice from the hip with circus-style revolver shots.In the best exchange of Rio Bravo, a surprised Nathan Burdette asks Dude: `You're pretty good with that gun when you're sober. How did that happen?' Dude responds with a cool arrogance, `If you mean being good with a gun, I've had a lot of practice. If you mean being sober, I'm gettin' practice on account of your brother.'While Dude is John T.'s close partner, Stumpy provides the happy trigger finger to protect the jail from the Burdette gang, and the wit and thick accent to keep the Fifties audience rolling in the aisles. Unfortunately, like many classic films, most of the humor in Rio Bravo - aside from Stumpy's dead-on impersonation of John Wayne that rivals only Joker's in Full Metal Jacket - does not age well.Young music and film star Ricky Nelson handles the character of Colorado Ryan with remarkable ease. Reluctant at first, John T. learns to trust Colorado for his lightning fast pistol skills, his aversion to meddling in others business, and his silky smooth crooning.Rio Bravo is certainly in the top tier of westerns, and it has its star-studded group of actors to thank. Even with their best work, however, the film just cannot make that considerable climb over the hump to greatness. Like many other films in its genre, the motivations of both the characters and the plotline become hopelessly muddled at times.For instance, the opening scene of Rio Bravo, which sets up the action and main story, is one of the most important parts of the film. In an effort to incorporate most major characters into this scene, however, the inspiration behind the players, especially Joe Burdette, is never clear. In addition, the history between John T. and Dude is never explored or fully explained.That said, director Howard Hawks proves that a wide assortment of actors not usually associated with the genre can help John Wayne carry the film and maintain the leisurely style that propels Rio Bravo.",

Rio Bravo, Hawks' rebuttal to High Noon, like Red River and El Dorado is no different. The male relationships are what holds the characters together, provides their redemptions, and is the primary source for drama and humor like a modern \"buddy picture\". The gunfights for the most part are pre-Peckinpah gun ballet. Duke Wayne provides the granite foundation for one of Dean Martin's best film performances, one of Walter Brennan's finest characterizations, and all are backed up by a stellar cast of western veterans like Angie Dickinson, Ward Bond, John Russell, Claude Akins, Bob Steele, and Bing Russell.

Kelly had a thankless role which she made the best of.

Not that she was the only guilty party. Scene after scene that could be dealt with effectively in a couple of lines and a look or two (if you have the actors, and Hawks did) went on and on and ON! Even the Duke couldn't shut up! Sometimes he'd go on for 10 or even 15 words in a breath! No wonder Quentin Tarantino loves this movie so much! As a follow-up, I asked my students to justify Angie's presence in the picture, and they all agreed (even the girls) it was because of her legs, and (the more perceptive noted) she was replaying Lauren Bacall from \"To Have and Have Not\" who Hawks wanted but Bogie got.

            "content": "I know its a clich\u00e9 to say that but sometimes it is all you can say. You watch movies like Rio Bravo and Casablanca and you just thing how the movies were made in a different era. They were filled with such joy and innocence and were so heartwarming, uplifting and enjoyable that you long for the era that has gone by.Rio Bravo stars John Wayne as John T. Chance a town sheriff who is trying to take on the big shot in town who has all the money. He has two deputies in the form of the Dude who was a drunkard but is now trying to become sober again and Stumpy played brilliantly by Walter Brennan. He played the character very well and I guess in the 148 minute runtime it was he who stood out the most. He was given a very endearing character to play and he made him even more endearing. Angie Dickinson is very beautiful and in every scene that she occupies you find yourself just lost in her face and she gives a good performance as the Sheriff's love interest.The movie begins with the Sheriff arresting the big shots brother and that sets off a series of events. The Sheriff refuses to release the brother and he has to keep fighting for. At first he refuses help and decides to go at it alone but slowly he realizes that everyone needs help and the town bands together at the end in a final shootout.Rio Bravo isn't like most westerns. It isn't the contemplative western and nor is the extremely violent western like The Wild Bunch. It is the 'Perfect Hangout Movie' as Tarantino calls it. Its about a bunch of guys hanging out and trying be happy and chilling out. Maybe it served as an inspiration for all those other movies. But somehow it retains a lot of enjoyment from watching the characters do their daily tasks and their interactions with each other.Rio Bravo was Directed expertly by an old master Howard Hawkes. The directors of America's golden age knew how to tell a story really well. They could keep you engaged in every aspect of the story and you wouldn't feel bored barring a few. Howard Hawkes is at the top of that list of directors.Rio Bravo is for a great afternoon's enjoyment. It is not demanding or challenging or any other things that you find like to find in a good movie. It is just a good movie like the fairy tales of our childhood. As light as a piece of pie but every bit as delicious.",

            "content": "Rio Bravo was apparently made as a personal riposte from Howard Hawks and John Wayne to the controversial, but excellent, High Noon. And while it certainly has its merits as an alternative to that film, the true success of Rio Bravo is its tremendous characters and the way in which Hawks presents and develops each of them.As the town sheriff, John Wayne is typically steadfast and imposing, and Dean Martin's quite brilliant turn as Wayne's drunken deputy, Dude, is a terrific foil for Wayne. In fact, these two characters could quite easily carry the film alone, but Hawks saw fit to spoil us further with a classic comedy role for Walter Brennan as a crippled deputy, a surprisingly enjoyable cameo from Ricky Nelson and a positively sizzling Angie Dickinson as Wayne's love interest.The whole cast work together excellently - even the near thirty year age difference between Dickinson and Wayne is forgivable in amongst the lovably coy exchanges of their courtship. Brennan is wonderfully cast and provides both comic relief and a reliable assuredness for all the other characters. Nelson is used sparingly, but performs admirably in his role as a young upstart - it is absolutely no hardship to hear he and Martin take turns to plug their day jobs in the film's musical interlude. Martin's performance is the real winner though - his acting here is first rate and gives the film a level of earnestness that could not be readily expected from something so apparently commercial.Rio Bravo has all the facets of a great Western - sharp gunfights, intrigue, superb dialogue and high quality performances that never get too hammy. In terms of film-making, I would place it above Red River in the list of Hawks-Wayne collaborations. It has its slight mis-steps - the film's resolution is possibly too quick and simple considering the build up it is given - but generally speaking this is a very fine Western that is easy to enjoy on many levels.",

            "content": "Famously made and inspired by director Howard Hawks' and actor John Wayne's contempt for the western High Noon, Rio Bravo similarly features a frontier lawman waiting on pins and needles until someone can arrive. In High Noon it was the bad guys. In Rio Bravo the bad guys are already in town, it's the U.S. Marshall the sheriff is waiting for. But make no mistake about it. That's nearly all these two movies have in common. High Noon was a dark, cold, and desolate black and white six-shooter melodrama and political commentary. Rio Bravo is a warm, exciting, joyous, and bright technicolor ode to male camaraderie and the old west. Howard Hawks' film contains all of his trademarks. Hard drinking men, fast talking women, enough hidden sexual innuendo to get you kicked out of Church, and of course the dialogue. Sharp, funny, and biting. John Wayne was in fact never much of a talker. He's no Cary Grant. But he is the Duke. Hawks' surrounds him with a colorful assortment of characters to react to and interact with, which is when Wayne is in his element. Walter Brennan is the yappy and big mouthed old codger, Dean Martin is the down-on-his-luck drunk, Angie Dickinson is the insecure but headstrong gambling dance hall girl, and Ricky Nelson is the quiet but youthful rebel gunfighter. Those are the main characters. Ward Bond offers good support as a do-gooder cattle rancher. Pedro Gonzales-Gonzales provides plenty of comic relief as the hen-pecked and stereotypical Mexican who runs the hotel and acts as a go-between for Dickinson and Wayne and their uncertain romantic relationship. Each of them too proud to express their true feelings and emotions. John Russell fills the shoes of the villain, a rich and ruthless cattle baron who hires men to do his killing for him - 50 silver dollars a head. Russell sees very little screen time, but other than the fact that his character is there and we the audience know he's there and so do the characters, he doesn't serve any real purpose. In fact he functions in a similar fashion to what Hitchcock describes as the Maguffin. The good guys need somebody to fight against and he's it. But that's just an excuse to get the ensemble together and have them talk, talk, talk, and then talk some more. You'd be hard pressed to find a movie with more masculine male-bonding and men being men than what's in Rio Bravo. The movie is comprised of one classic scene and entertaining moment after the other. Angie Dickinson throwing the flower vase through the window, the gang sitting around and singing \"My Rifle, My Pony, and Me\", the seven minute opening without a word of dialogue, Dean Martin pouring the whiskey from the glass back into the bottle, John Wayne going up to see Dickinson at the film's conclusion, and on and on and on. Great story, great script, great acting, beautifully shot. What more could you ask for?",

However, Hawks does not forget to bring a little humor to his story, which clearly sets him apart from most other western directors.The cast is perfect: John Wayne, in the role of a sheriff who does not give way in front of the fairer sex, is more touching than usual; Dean Martin, an alcoholic in the process of repentance, undoubtedly finds his best role there; Walter Brennan, as a lame and too talkative old man, is excellent; as for Angie Dickinson, she brings a little freshness to this world of brutes.Finally, the music of the great Dimitri Tiomkin is very memorable. 10/10.",

            "content": "Instead of the suave, easy going partier with a drink in his hand that pretty much defined Dean Martin, we see a serious alcoholic, complete with the shakes of withdrawal and the look of despondence. For Dean's performance, and for Walter Brennan at his most outrageous, Angie Dickinson at her most alluring and Rick Nelson in a rare film role, I give six stars. The dialogue is fun and entertaining so my rating also goes for that. As far as everything else---.The only thing that could differentiate one John Wayne character from another is his age at the time of the production. The later the film, the slower moving and the more crotchety the creature. This one was sometime between True Grit and his early thirties Grade B westerns, closer to the former. He was slightly aged and admittedly tired, but still able to rise for the cause when a beautiful woman, half his age, essentially threw herself at him. He's watchable but if you know anything about my politics, you have to assume that I'm not a huge fan. Every few years, I give one or two of John Wayne's reputed classics a chance. While I'm rarely repulsed, I'm not enthralled that often, either.A semi-crotchety aging sheriff, with limited and barely reliable assistance from a recovering drunk, an old man and a starry eyed young guitarist, decides to take on a gang of roughly forty armed, skilled, cold and ruthless professionals for the purpose of keeping one man in prison. It makes sense to me. Get yourself and your three best friends killed, or if you rely on the fact that you're the indestructible John Wayne, kill forty other people, for the sake of one prisoner. And who was the prisoner? Was he a notorious bank robber and mass murderer who was wanted in fifteen states? Actually, he was the brother of an affluent businessman, who killed one man in an old school western bar fight. Maybe it could have been called murder since the victim was said to be unarmed but was his prosecution worth the many lives it might ultimately cost? The shooter was a rich, well connected white man in Texas in the nineteenth century. Even in twenty first century Texas, a wealthy Caucasian in the same situation would likely be able to claim he was standing his ground and avoid prison. If he just shot someone in a bar, and no one had an abortion, I'd say his chances of walking free would be rather good.The film also takes far too long to get where it's going. The chase should have come ten minutes after the capture. The afore mentioned actors, John Wayne aside, keep us entertained through the lengthy ride, though.Recommended for Dean, Angie, Walter, Rick and the creative, interesting dialogue. And of course, I try to see everything that's considered a classic, even if it takes fifty years. If you expect anything but average John Wayne, then I'd say re-think your standards and enjoy.And did people really have guitars like that in the old west? If the film wasn't made in 1959, I'd have guessed that Rick's instrument came from the Woodstock era.",

Her weary longing for a better life than the one she has, seizing on the Sheriff as someone she wants to stay with as long as she can despite him trying to get rid of her as much as he can, I think it was an excellent performance.I don't want to list any more of the reasons to watch this film that I already have. There are just so many as I mentioned at the start that it's really a no-brainer. It is also one of those films that seeing it several times it just seems to get better with each viewing.But I'm going to list one reason here at the end that also matters to me. This is a John Wayne Western that is not a racist film.

Though both these teen idols were no actors the sheer power of the Duke helped their acting abilities look better than they were.

            "content": "In a small town in Texas, a criminal (Claude Akins) is arrested after committing a murder. He is kept in prison by three guys. The local sheriff (John Wayne) and his two deputies, a drunk (Dean Martin) and a crazy old fool (Walter Brennan). Still, a threat hangs around their necks (and around town). The guy they imprisoned is the brother of a big time criminal (John Russell) who will do anything to help him escape. The three main characters have to do their best in order to keep their prisoner in until the judge comes to take care of the whole thing. But the judge takes too damn long to come.In the meantime a group of people arrives in town. Among them an old friend of Wayne's called Pat Wheeler(Ward Bond), a beautiful ex (?) gambler (Angie Dickinson) and one of Wheelers assistants (Ricky Nelson) who later teams up with Wayne. When Wayne explains the situation to Ward Bond and clarifies that the only people helping him are a drunk who can't stand and an old guy, his friend asks: \"That's all you got?\". Wayne responds: \"That's what I got\". And that's the whole point. Rio Bravo is about people who know life is hard but they accept that as a fact and try to make the best of it. It's a film about a bunch of people in the search of confirmation. Every character in this film is weak and struggles with his weaknesses. This is expressed in a really subtle way through Howard Hawks' visual storytelling and one of best screenplays of the 50s. Just take a look at the opening scene. Dean Martin walks in a bar. He looks dirty and tired. Most customers look at him as if he's the worst bum of the town. Someone throws a coin in a spittoon near Martin. Martin bents in order to take the coin and buy alcohol. Suddenly, as Martin reaches for the spittoon, someone kicks it away from him. He looks up. It's Wayne. That's the first time we see Wayne in the film and the way this moment is directed sets up the way he is related with Martin. Martin sees Wayne from a low angle. He looks imposing, proud and dynamic. He is almost a father figure to Martin. Actually, latter in the film, Martin calls Wayne Papa. Throughout the film these two guys try to balance their relationship. In the first half of the film Martin depends fully on Wayne. He is the one who gets him out of every mess and tries all the time to motivate him in order to get out of the state he is. When Wayne talks, Martin keeps his eyes on him. He exposes his weaknesses, his faults and disadvantages all the time to Wayne, hoping he will comfort him. But Wayne doesn't do that. He expects the best from him. Martin used to be a great shooter in the old days and Wayne tries to get him back in shape. Not though asking him to stop drinking. But through his high expectations. Wayne's character is even weaker and although at a first look he may seam strong and willing he is the most screwed up of them all. He is the guy who has a thing about his image. He has built a persona and he holds tight to it. He wants people to think he's cool and strong and he does his best to achieve that. He is really detractive with everyone. When his friend Ward Bond is killed by the Russell gang he blames Ricky Nelson for not protecting him. He is very ironic with Walter Brennan for everything he does wrong. But Angie Dickinson touches his soft spot. From the first time they meet she has the upper hand though it might appear otherwise. She just has to raise her dress up a bit or throw a minor sexual insinuation and Wayne becomes all sweaty and nervous. He is terrified by her sexuality but if we look at it more deeply we can even say that what terrifies him is the possibility of him bonding with someone in an erotic level. His fear of sex and emotion makes him look like a fool most of the times he's in the same scene with Dickinson. But there is a point where all that stops and Wayne, subtly, changes and accepts his feelings for Dickinson. That point is defined by the moment in which Dickinson calls Wayne's character by his real name (John). She is the first one to do so and that's a way of her declaring her wish to be closer with Wayne. She actually is the only person who is able to see through his hard boiled persona.By the end of the picture, when the bad guys have lost, the relations of the characters are balanced. When Wayne is walking with Martin, who can now stand on his feet (literally and metaphorically), Martin gives him advice on what to do and how to behave with Dickinson. Everything is alright now, not because the Russell gang is gone, but because all the characters of the film have reached a point of consciousness. There is a scene where all the main characters (Wayne, Martin, Brennan and Nelson) are at the prison guarding Akins. The Russell gang has put a Mexican band playing a song which is supposed to warn them that they're about to die. Our guys seam worried and nervous.And what do they do? They grab a guitar and they start singing. That's a moment where these guys really bond with each other. Music (and art) is supposed to do that (bring people together). And that's what the movie finally is about. About people's need to come together. Not because they have to serve the law. But because the need for company is maybe the most basic of all human needs.",

Rickie Nelson, whom most people would not connect with westerns, does an excellent turn as a young baby-faces deputy who is not scared to tackle any villain. Dean Martin plays well two parts, that of a scared drunk and then that of a sober, reformed deputy.There is really little of a plot to speak of. A killer (played by Claude Akins) is arrested for killing a man in a bar, and then his older brother (played by John Russell) along with his brother's henchmen, attempt to break the younger brother out of jail, though it's not as easy as they think it will be.In addition to great action, Nelson and martin do beautiful singing, Martin's voice being melodious.

            "content": "When Rio Bravo was released in the spring of 1959, it didn't receive the best reviews but time has proved how inspirational and timeless this movie is. Unlike most westerns at the time like the films of John Ford, it doesn't deal with moral or racial issues. Ford's deeply haunting and emotional The Searchers (1956) is an example. While director Howard Hawks' film is more fun and less dramatic, it is arguably just as personal as anything Ford ever did.Hawks is a director who has had a profound influence on many American and even foreign filmmakers and critics. He made films that are perceptive and witty but also because he was maybe the most versatile director at the time, his work has found a wide range of audiences. Rio Bravo continues the many themes of most Hawks' films and this time, I would argue that it comes together in the best way. From the very first scene, which is a brilliant piece of silent filmmaking, we get a clear idea who each character is and it sets up the story perfectly. We are then taken on a journey of action, adventure, comedy, romance and even drama and self discovery.I won't give away too much in this review because I feel that it would ruin the emotional impact. To understand this film is to understand Hawks as a storyteller who brings together a unique group of characters who are flawed but by sticking together, they can get the job done and come out stronger people. Dean Martin gives an amazing performance as a man who is fighting with the bottle, we assume that he is weak but we get an understanding to why he is struggling and also, when he holds it together, can be very quick and sharp. I've always thought that Martin plays a character that we can all relate to because we can all find ourselves in that position in life and call me sentimental but it's a moving look at any of us are capable of many things but must fight our demons in order to see it and move on.John Wayne is at the top of his game here, just as much as in The Searchers. He plays the sheriff in town who is in a tough situation and can't get caught up with the new girl in town. It's one of the best romances that only Hawks could pull off. They clearly don't understand each other but is obvious that they can't live without each other. We get a lot of the Hawks wit and insight on men and women as in Bringing Up Baby (1938), Only Angels Have Wings (1939) and To Have And Have Not (1944) and it's always fun to watch. Hawks was the best with romance in my opinion, he always got the best out of his actors as well.We see many other characters through out the film and always understand who they are. Not one dull or underdeveloped character in the whole film the way I see it. The point in this review is that Rio Bravo is the best example of what makes a strong Hollywood film, also Howard Hawks in general. Hawks always made fun movies but the characters were never not thought of and never taken for granted, they were always personal to Hawks as well. Today, big advanced special effects distract us from what makes a good movie, the story and the characters. Maybe my review is too simplistic but for me, Rio Bravo is a great movie that holds up and is still relevant as it ever was. I've learned so much about storytelling from this film and hold it as a personal influence on my ambition of wanting to make movies.",

And it was a damn good movie. The characters were great especially dean martin and IL stumpy, he do make me laugh. I also thought the song they sang in the sheriff building was pretty swell too. The action sequences were good especially at the end when they shoot the holy hell at the house. All in all an excellent film worth watching.BTW I'm only 17!",

I guess most of us who didn't live in those times fail to understand that that is what people wanted.

I felt Dean Martin and Rickey Nelson really stole the show here as well.Yeah sure, it suffers from a few of the same problems spaghetti westerns of the time did. Some of the gunfights were a little tacky and unrealistic, Angie Dickenson as the love interest sometimes overacted. The lead up to the murder at the beginning by Joe Burdette that initiated the whole plot seemed pretty flimsy and forced.But the good far outweighs the bad with this one.",

Good solid western in the Wayne vein, but god awful way too long and drawn out......too much dialogue and not enough action and way too much talking and talking.....director Howard Hawks wanted a film of a little over two hours and got it but bored the viewer for spells. How many times can Wayne jabber over much of nothing with Martin, Nelson, Dickinson and Brennan.......good casting with Martin and Nelson who crooned a couple of songs for the young set in the film.....For my money, Martin gives an excellent performance as a bum and a drunk and town misfit. Angie Dickinson obviously in her 20s is the love interest for Wayne who definitely appeared to be in his 50s and you wonder how Hawks could have had the two become romantically involved in the film.....way too much of an age difference for the two to become interested in each other for my tastes. Otherwise a good solid western and When does Wayne ever disappoint in these kinds of films. You knew when you went to the theater back in those days the Duke would stand tall and knock the hell out of his enemies. Wayne does not disappoint in this film and only in my mind \"The Sons of Katie Elder\" is a better western by him, possibly \"The Horse Soldiers\" also. Sit back and relax and watch but be ready for a lot of useless talk in the film.....still very entertaining Wayne vehicle.",

            "content": "Howard Hawks, director or numerous great films such as \"Scarface\" from 1932, \"His Girl Friday\" from 1940 and \"Red River\" from 1948 gives us an American western like no other. One of the great things about \"Rio Bravo\" are the characters, Hawks has a great talent for making us care so much for these characters and here you get all the sort of characters you'd want in a great western. There's a tough sheriff (John Wayne as John T. Chance), a drunken ex-sheriff (Dean Martin as Dude), a young gunslinger (Ricky Nelson as Colorado Ryan), a beautiful broad who's constantly flirting with the sheriff (Angie Dickinson as Feathers) and an old cripple who can't shut-up to save his life (Walter Brennan as Stumpy). Like another American classic western \"High Noon\", we get a great showdown at the end and let me just say that it's an explosive scene.The plot is simple, a man named Joe is arrested for a murder in a saloon and Chance is holding him in a small jail where his friend Stumpy is guarding him. If Joe's brother's henchmen try to break in the jail, Stumpy will kill Joe. Usually I would say that if Dean Martin was in the picture, then I wouldn't really care for the film. But to my surprise, his performance was the most interesting. Not that the other performances weren't grand because this film simply doesn't have a bad performance, even though I am not a fan of the Duke. Although he did have a few great performances such as \"Red River\", \"Sands of Iwo Jima\" and The Searchers\" which is arguably is best role.Watching this film for the second time, I was reminded of Dean Martin's great battle over alcoholism in the film. From his torn clothes, his facial remarks, his non-stop sweating, to him punching his leg several times to stop the shaking or not even being able to role his own cigarettes since his shaking hands wont permit.Lately I've discovered that \"Rio Bravo\" was remade into \"El Dorado\" also directed by Howard Hawks which may not be as great as \"Rio Bravo\" but it still was a high entertaining western also staring John Wayne and this time Robert Mitchum taking on Dean Martin's role and to my surprise the young James Caan since the oldest film I've ever seen of James Caan was \"The Godfather\" in his most glorious role as 'Sonny'.According to IMDb.com, I've read that director Quentin Tarantino stated that \"Rio Bravo\" is one of his all-time favorite films, and I find this very easy to understand because it's a film that is very hard to dislike. It can easily be called at least a guilty pleasure, although there isn't really anything to be guilty about liking this film. However out of the whole film, I had one objection to it. There is a scene where Dean Martin starts to sing in the jail and young Ricky Nelson joins in with his guitar and sings along. Now this bothered me not because I'm not a fan of these two singers but I just believe that no one wants to see people singing in a western. Other than this scene, I have no complaints towards this film, the acting is great, the directing is great and hence the film is great.",

Angie Dickinson also does a great job as maybe one of the better leading ladies opposite Wayne, but the tone and urgency of the film's plot sadly make her scenes seem wasted and uninspired. In a way the film is overrated by some, but it has just about everything a western needs (besides a terrific theme) and gets better upon multiple viewings. Perhaps the best character driven Western since Stagecoach. Fantastic final shootout, writing, and sets. Short warning: Manly, conservative underlings may turn off feminist and liberal viewers.",

Hawks even contrives a romance between Wayne and Dickinson, for the lady-folkSomething for everyone, although Rio Bravo finished behind Ben Hur and Some Like it Hot in the box office rankings of 1959, so maybe they should have thrown in a cartoon, for the kidsHoward would Hawk the same basic premise around Hollywood for another two movies (Eldorado & Rio Lobo), so the formula was considered successful enough to try again (and again)And John Carpenter used it as the spine of two movies (Assault on Precinct 13 and Ghost of Mars); three, if you count the more tendentious example of Prince of Darkness (which I do)Rio Bravo's creatively and technically more successful than any of those films because it's made by a master craftsman at the peak of his abilities and with a wealth of experience behind himThe film's tense action set-ups play perfectly without dialogue, the film makers' grasp of storytelling meaning it'd work just as well in the silent era, when Hawks began his directorial careerThe scene where Wayne and Martin track down the hired goon who murdered Ward Bond's character is particularly effectiveIt's basically a tutorial in film making - how to communicate the geography of a scene to the audience and when to reveal a hidden threat to create tensionAll that and it's a callback to the film's opening scene, using the narrative device of the spittoon to show the progress Martin's character has made and to reverse his humiliationThat's Martin's role, here - to undergo the transformation and follow the character arc the dramatic lead would usually undertakeBecause John Wayne is playing John Wayne - super competent and as solid and unchanging as the mountains of the film's Arizona backdrop - the function of the lead character is split into twoMartin performs all the self-questioning, doubt and growth that mark the hero's journey and delineate the three act structure of a screenplay *around* Wayne, who stands solid at the centre of the movie like a monument, unaffected by anything that transpires between mortal menThat's not a complaint on my part or a mistake on the part of the film makersBy this point, Wayne was an untouchable god of cinema. He'd battered Victor McLaglen from one end of Ireland to the other, hunted and killed the Comanche war chief Scar, and won WWIIThe idea a bullet could hurt him was ridiculousWalter Brennan's comedy turn as Stumpy is the obvious highlight; irascible but loyal, a heightened performance so stylised it teeters on the edge of absurdity but never topples overDickinson's great, tooLuminously beautiful but animated and humorous in a way glamorous actresses seldom feel the need to be - every bit as good a foil for Wayne as Maureen O'Hara, even if their May-September romance is never convincingRicky Nelson's absolutely awful - stiff, stilted and the least convincing cowboy since John Cleese in Silverado - but we don't need to say any more about thatThe film's use of Technicolor is absolutely fantastic - stylised to the point of abstractionThe highlights in Pedro Gonzalez's hair read blue and the satin of Dickinson's blouse, the walls of the saloon, and the dusty streets of the town are all the same yellow ochreIt reminds me of Dick Tracy (1990), where production designers tried to emulate the four-colour process of newspaper strips, so that every red in the movie was the same red, every green the same greenCarlos the comedy saloon owner, his spitfire wife, and Bert the Chinese undertaker are either dreadful ethnic caricatures or a surprising level of representation in a film of this era, depending which hobby horse you rode into town uponEveryone, including a barely 18 y/o Nelson, smokes in this movie, with Dude's inability to roll a cigarette providing a running gag as well as a metaphor for his loss of confidence in the second actMusic's used sparingly in most scenes, so when it does arrive - in the singalong mentioned earlier or when the villain pays the Mariachi band to play a death song to intimidate the heroes - it's particularly effectiveThe film's finale, featuring a cackling Brennan destroying the villain's lair by throwing sticks of dynamite for Wayne and Martin to shoot in mid-flight, is great fun, even if the heroes never feel in jeopardyIt's a great way to relieve the dramatic tension the film's spent building up during its very long (2 hours plus) running timeApparently, it was Hawks' daughter who came up with the TNT ending, which reminds me of Spielberg complaining he didn't know how to end Jaws, prompting a friend to tell him the shark had to explodeWorked for the end of Star Wars, tooRio Bravo's a pure popcorn movie, but it's a fantastically well made popcorn movie and a lot of fun...",

The acting is very good with great chemistry between everyone and good humor as well which gives lots of charm. The secret is the dialogue is actually very good and carries a lot of the slower moments in this well. The cinematography is very well done also with well framed shots and memorable scenes. Though the town can feel a bit generic and the action is ok it is a bit of a letdown. The music is very good also though it isn't used that much in this which is surprising that this never really feels dry. The editing is excellent overall, this is very focused and really is a character driven drama more than a action western which I didn't expect and more so didn't mind really. It's also paced very well though it definitely felt like it could've had more action in between than what is here. What's impressive again is for over 2 hours despite the lack of action it never feels unfocused or boring because of how well the editing, dialogue and chemistry is amongst everyone. The end battle is ok but it's a bit of a letdown, definitely would've liked a bigger more action packed ending.

            "content": "A stalwart Western from a legendary director.\n\nDirector Howard Hawks' Western drama Rio Bravo (1959) is a sturdy story of real justice full of robust men and their bravery. I'm glad Hawks produced great Westerns like Red River and Rio Bravo among his crime drama classics like Scarface. Hawks' silent opening confrontation is amazing just like every violent encounter in Rio Bravo.\n\nEditor Folmar Blangsted's sharp cuts keep Rio Brave moving steadily for 141 minutes. I found Hawks' direction captivating as he reels you in with particular camera movements to let you know where a gunman is coming from or hiding. Cinematographer Russell Harlan's smooth panning shots and careful framing show off men standing up against numerous gunmen and hard calls. Rio Bravo is certainly one of Howard Hawks' best films.\n\nWriters Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett take a tough guy sheriff with morals and his drunken deputy and thrust them into a tale of courage against a gang of criminals seeking to release a murderer. It's a cool holdout in a town kind of Western with sterling performances from John Wayne and Dean Martin. Rio Bravo is a neat anti-alcohol movie as Dean Martin's alcoholic Dude only suffers because of his withdrawal. You see him ridiculed for his day drinking and he can only succeed sober.\n\nIt's thoughtfully written and pretty to watch. Leo K. Kuter's art direction leans into desolate saloons and the small wooden town atmosphere for a striking Western. Ralph S. Hurst's set decoration has fairly fancy lanterns, and furniture props among all the long rifles and pistols. Composer Dimitri Tiomkin's film score is very nice every time it chimes in during Rio Bravo. Sound designer Robert B. Lee lets Tiomkin's music gently fade in and gunshots ring out clearly.\n\nJohn Wayne is cool as the principled sheriff as John T. Chance. He's a tough guy Western hero with actual values of obeying the law, being kind to friends, and decent to women. Dean Martin is pretty solid as the drunkard deputy Dude. His conflicted feelings over whether or not to quit or drink again. His somber singing shows off his deep voice and mournful tone. Ricky Nelson is excellent as the nice and helpful gunslinger Colorado Ryan. His quickdraw pistol firing and sweet higher singing is quite cool in Rio Bravo. Ricky Nelson honestly may be a better actor than Dean Martin in Rio Bravo.\n\nAngie Dickinson is stunning as the femme fatale gambling lady Feathers. She's charming, smart, and kind. It's easy to see why Angie Dickinson became famous for Feathers. Both Colorado Ryan & Feathers constantly help out Chance so often that I started thinking Rio Bravo is the opposite of High Noon. No one will help Gary Cooper in High Noon, whereas everyone helps John Wayne in Rio Bravo despite him not wanting aid from strangers to get them involved in such dangerous business.\n\nWalter Brennan is a riot as the high pitched deputy Stumpy with his endless complaining. Ward Bond is friendly as Pat Wheeler until his shocking death sequence. John Russell is real quietly vicious as the wealthy ranch owner Nathan Burdette, who is out for blood on behalf of his brother Joe Burdette. Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez is funny and pleasant as the amiable saloon and hotel owner Carlos Robante. Estelita Rodriguez is pretty and fiery as Consuela Robante. Claude Akins is fierce as hothead criminal Joe Burdette, who is quick to fire. It's a fun fact that Kurt Russell's father Bing Russell is the cowboy gunned down by Claude Akins in the stellar opener.\n\nCostume designer Marjorie Best's tan jacket, pants, and hat for John Wayne's Chance's look cool paired with his red collared shirt and brown rifle. Dean Martin's initial jacket with holes is so trash. Dude's blue shirt and brown vest look cool with his black pants once he shaves and cleans up. Angie Dickinson looks breathtaking with her feathered scarf, golden blouse, thin waisted black belt, and checkered skirt and suit jacket. She's a real vision in gold like her combed up dark golden hair. Make-up artist Gordon Bau did a wonderful job with Angie's stylish hairdo.\n\nIn short, Rio Bravo is an excellent Western from the Golden Age of Hollywood.",

            "content": "The sorry bunch.  So this is about an aging sheriff (John Wayne) in a small Texan town.  He has jailed a murderer (Claude Akins) and intends on holding him for the marshal, but the murderer's brother (John Russell) is in town to break him out.  The numbers are not on the sheriff's side, and he only has the aid of a drunk (Dean Martin), a disabled man (Walter Brennan), and a young gunfighter (Ricky Nelson) to maintain law and order.  Now I didn't know a ton about this one; all I really knew was that it is one of Quentin Tarantino's favorite Westerns.  If you couldn't tell by his entire library, that is a man who knows his Westerns.  I'm still working through some genre staples for my birthday week, so I figured this would be a welcome addition to my knowledge on film.  I'm glad that I did, and I had a great time watching it.  Now somewhat shockingly, this is actually my first experience with John Wayne.  I seriously started watching movies back in 2008, and for whatever reason, I just chose Eastwood over Wayne.  Maybe I felt like I owed loyalty to one over the other, like how people will frequent their favorite burger joint over the competition.  I can now say that I see the appeal.  John Wayne has screen presence and this intangible way of commanding the room.  I thought all of those impressions from countless comedians that I've seen over the years were all exaggerated, but for the most part, they are right on the money.  He has a very distinctive line delivery and cadence in his voice, and he always comes off like he is the toughest guy in the room.  Rio Bravo has a fun script that is all about characters.  In fact, I would say that it is more about talking than it is about actual action.  You get to know the group you are spending time with, and as a result, you care what happens to them.  You watch a man go through real struggles with alcohol, and you get true comedic relief from the disabled deputy who complains that nobody tells him anything.  This builds character, and you want to see the group form a plan that will work.  While I did very much enjoy this, I don't feel like Rio Bravo is perfect.  I think that they could have gotten this to run under the two-hour mark if they tried hard enough, and I did feel somewhat fatigued with the length coming in at 141 minutes.  There are pieces featured that could have been cut.  I get that you have Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson in the same film together, but the jail concert they put on could have been scrapped, and it would have zero impact on the story.  Overall, I am content with the selection for my introduction to John Wayne.",

            "content": "This Western movie works in large part because of the interaction of the main three characters: John Chance the town sheriff, Dude as an alcoholic cowboy trying to get clean, and Stumpy as an elderly cripple who serves in the sheriff's office. They argue and spar throughout the movie, adding much comic relief to an otherwise conventional story.\n\nJoe Burnett is a powerful local rancher who kills an innocent bystander during a fight he provoked, and is arrested and taken to the town jail for it, where the sheriff and the deputized Dude and Stumpy hold him in wait for the marshal. They hold off the rancher's brother and his hired hands, while in the meantime an old friend of Chance comes to town with his group, as well as a woman named Feathers who is a card player and possible cheater. The questions are whether Chance and company can hold off the hired hands, and whether Dude can stay clean and competent as he withdraws from his alcoholism, and how good is Stumpy with his health problems anyway. Also what is the story with Colorado, the young man who came with the supply train, and will he get involved? Not until after watching the movie did I learn about this movie being a deliberate answer to \"High Noon\", where that sheriff kept going to the townspeople begging them for help, only they were too cowardly. Chance is different; he refuses outside help but gets it anyway. A more convincing scenario when you think about it.",

But on watching this with that context in mind, you realise that High Noon is a better movie on almost every level. The earlier film is a masterclass in tight pacing and building dramatic tension. Bravo, on the other hand, is waaay too long, and needs at least a third of the script shaving off. Wayne is deeply average, verging on robotic, and Walter Brennan as the supposed \"comic\" character is borderline incomprehensible and frequently plain irritating. Dean Martin is the best thing here as the talented drunk (one wonders how much acting was required), and Angie Dickinson is also excellent but is let down by a poorly written role in which she continually throws herself at Wayne (a storyline as incomprehensible as Brennan's accent). Overall this is a far more simplistic, blunt instrument than the film it was designed to surpass. If you intend to make it through all 135 minutes of it, I recommend you have some strong coffee to hand.",

            "content": "This may be the only classic Western I've viewed and only added it after reading it's one of Quentin Tarantino's favorite movies. A (100/91) on RT, I had high standards for Rio Bravo, which inexplicably felt too slow given all of the rifle-firing action. My inexperience with Westerns will likely come through here, but was everyone really so chill about people getting shot in bars and on the dirt roads separating hotels and saloons? John Wayne, the Western King, plays Sheriff John T. Chance, a lawman who, along with his on-the-wagon deputy, Dude (Dean Martin), handicapped assistant, Stumpy (Walter Brennan), who has a notable, yokel laugh, and young-gun, Colorado (Ricky Nelson), take on Nathan Burdette (John Russell) and his gang who seek to remove Joe Burdette (Claude Akins) from custody. The film would've benefited much more had it actually been a single-location, \"Call of Duty-Zombies\" style hold-out. The opening bar fight felt kinda dumb and I was nervous there would be a lot of eye-rolling, but the action itself is pretty good \u2014 especially the shoot-out when Chance and Co. go on the offensive. I actually enjoyed Dude's struggle with alcoholism, as it wasn't just a character trait but helped propel the plot. Dino and Nelson had the kind of chemistry singing together you'd expect to see in High School Musical. I did a dog-head tilt when first hearing \"The Cutthroat Song,\" before realizing its connection to Kill Bill. The most notable line, which I've been repeating in my terrible John Wayne impression, was \"You want that gun? Pick it up. I wish you would.\" Would've it made more sense just to release the prisoner and have the U.S. Marshals, who were six days away at the start of the film, pick him up at the Burdette Ranch or its environs later? Sure, but this is the Wild West, baby! Less jukin', more shootin'.",

That said, calling it one of the greatest films of all time (looking at you, Sight & Sound), or even one of the greatest Westerns of all time, is absolutely ridiculous. Its contemporary motivation as a response to High Noon is still perfectly relevant today; High Noon is a cynical, thought-provoking, and intelligent look at human nature that transcends the genre, while Rio Bravo is a functionally formulaic devotee to all its conventions, one that stands for nothing beyond \"ol'-fashioned American values\". Good guys are good (and always win), bad guys are bad, women swoon, and nuance doesn't exist. It's just the perception of the world that a host of conservative actors would put together to make a political statement in response to what they perceived as a Communist invasion. None of that means that the film is bad, but it does prevent it from being great, especially when so many other genre representatives have done so much more. It's still a great representative of the Wayne dynamic, a hugely influential piece of popular culture. One major criticism: the antagonists, who seldom seem to form any sort of effective force, and hardly feel threatening despite frequent clashes. (4/5)",

Here the director reunited with his RED RIVER stars Wayne and Brennan\u2014with left-leaning Clift replaced by teen idol Nelson\u2014as a sort of response to the pessimistic anti-McCarthyism of HIGH NOON with a story about the standard conservative platitudes about principled professionalism, personal responsibility, and homosocial camaraderie (not to mention a sense of just barely concealed contempt). In this way, as Richard Brody put it in his review while noting Hawks' authorial signature, \"[t]he movie is simultaneously an apogee of the classic Western style, with its principled violence in defense of just law, and an eccentrically hyperbolic work of modernism, which yokes both bumptious erotic comedy and soul-searing rawness to the mission.\" Nonetheless, today the moralism falls flat and Wayne's larger-than-life persona (even on a smaller-than-scale set) doesn't carry the same weight, yet the sheer craft at work and the nonchalant humor on display keep things engaging and moving, making for a movie and characters (if not the actual cast) you want to hang out with though not hang on to every word and shot.",

I didn\u2019t know what was coming because the cast was such a strange group of actors, including a couple of singers I never imagined in the old west. The first scene was enough to convince me that Dean Martin could fit in despite the fact that I\u2019m used to seeing him in a more suave role. His charisma was used in a different way in this movie, and I thought it was a good method of creating a sympathetic hero. Ricky Nelson also works because they put him in the role of the baby-faced new kid in town. Between these two guys, Walter Brennan, and Angie Dickinson, I was happy with the amount of humor and charm in the movie. They did so much for the film that I could overlook the flat acting of John Wayne. He was allowed to be the straight, boring guy while everyone around him brought energy. Rio Bravo had potential to be one of the more tense movies I\u2019ve ever seen. Every moment it felt like danger was knocking at the door, and the enemy could strike. But I had some trouble understanding the behavior of the characters in the film. For instance there were long stretches when the bad guys would do nothing, despite the fact that they seemed to have an advantage the entire time. There were scenes when the sheriff and his deputies would wander out on pointless errands, and I couldn\u2019t fathom why that was a good decision. Establishing a ticking clock would have helped a lot. I think the result of all these strange choices was a longer runtime than the movie warranted. It dragged more than I would have liked, and I was worried that boredom was going to strike at any moment, but there was just enough tension in the story to keep me engaged. The end was everything that I wanted, and made up for a lot of the slow parts. I think Rio Bravo knew what the audience was waiting to see, and loaded that finale with all of it. Each moment was one more that made me smile like a fool. It was the ideal showdown with some levity, and a healthy dose of drama all mixed into one scene. I was cheering like a fool while sitting alone in a room watching it unfold. It was so delightful and satisfying that I started to forget about the complaints that I had in earlier scenes. The slow pace seemed worthwhile because I started to see it like the pressure building before the cork pops out of the bottle with a glorious fountain of champagne. I don\u2019t think Rio Bravo is one of the greatest Westerns, because they needed to edit somewhat to get the pacing right, but it ended up being a fun ride that was worth the time investment.",

Something to do with some ridiculous love subplot between John Wayne's character and a woman young enough to be his daughter and some other character's backstories that were just unnecessary. The old man in this(not John Wayne, the other one) is amusing here and there, and the final shootout was alright, but man.. this was too damn long and boring the rest of the time. Zzzzzz....",

Howard Hawks directed this film out of his dislike of the anti-McCarthyism Gary Cooper western, \"High Noon.\" Star John Wayne hated that film because of it's politics, while Hawks reportedly disliked the film over it's namby-pamby sheriff who has to go around asking for help and can't man-up and do it himself. As with most Hawks films and just about every Wayne film, it's a very masculine picture. Wayne's Sheriff John T. Chance arrests no good Claude Akins, who drunkenly kills someone. However, Akins is connected and part of a powerful family, so Wayne has to hold off Akins' brother and his henchmen from busting Claude out of jail. Wayne does have the assistance of the town drunk, Dean Martin, and old man, Walter Brennan, a new kid in town, Ricky Nelson (who does sing a duet with Dean at one point), and also the very leggy Angie Dickinson. Ward Bond is also around too. The film honestly does meander at times and is a western that would seem dated to modern viewers, but for me, it's just a perfect western that has been influential on so many action films, everything from John Carpenter's \"Assault on Precinct 13\" to James Cameron's \"Aliens\" to Robert Rodriguez & Quentin Tarantino's \"From Dusk Till Dawn.\" Also of note, the film was written by Leigh Brackett and Jules Furthman. On a more personal note, \"Rio Bravo\" was my go-to movie for testing girlfriends. And for those who know me, my wife did pass the Rio Bravo test, sitting all the way through it's 141 minutes of it and pretended to like it.",

            "content": "It's Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson and, of course, the most dynamite musician of all, Mr. John Wayne, pilgrims. This is a weird cast line-up for a western, which could have just stuck with the singer theme, but seriously, what, were they just supposed to not involve John Wayne in this western? As long as this film is, Wayne would had to have showed up eventually, which is where \"High Noon\" really blew it when it was trying to get Wayne in the lead role... which was probably a little more compelling because Gary Cooper didn't play the same John Wayne role that you couldn't get rid of in the western film industry of '50s. ...No, I'm kidding; there's no getting tired of that good old-fashioned John Wayne charm, especially when it combines with that good old-fashioned Dean Martin charm. Wow, this sounds like one seriously charismatic duo, as well it should be, because two-and-a-half hours might just be a little too long for John Wayne, or at least that's probably what they thought back in 1959, a little bit before Wayne decided to really challenge that theory. Well, folks, this film is at least less overlong and exhausting than \"The Alamo\" and \"The [u]Longest[/u] Day\", which is probably why it's so endearing, you know, outside of that good old-fashioned John Wayne and Dean Martin Charm. With that said, while this film isn't exactly two-and-a-half hours wasted, if it isn't Wayne's voice, then something ought to try your patience.\r\n\r\nIt's debatable just how refreshing the film is in certain places, but it's even harder to deny the film's still often devolving to conventions, with little to say that's new in the unraveling of a story that makes matters worse by taking from melodramatic roots. As with many westerns of this nature, melodramatics play an instrumental role in driving a very Hollywood narrative, and that's fine, but for only so long, before it becomes a touch too obvious that the near-overwrought histrionic plotting seems to be attempting to compensate for natural shortcomings. This is a less adventurous and more intimate Hollywood western that has plenty of intrigue on paper, but also has plenty of natural shortcomings and minimalisms which probably shouldn't be crafted into something of a pseudo-epic. At just shy of two-and-a-half hours, the film tends to seriously outstay its welcome, meandering along with expendable material, as well as potentially dismissible material that seems to be forcibly clung onto the narrative, usually as those aforementioned histrionics. All of this dramatic bloating and structural dragging aren't especially severe issues, but they're recurrent throughout a questionably hefty runtime, and that tires your patience about as much as the times in which, of all things, storytelling falls flat, not just with the thin spells to characterization or anything like that, but with certain thin spells to direction that are near-blanding, and all too often distancing in their sense of stylistic laziness. There's something vacant about this film, and that's a shame, because this film could have done a lot with its length, rather than laze through it, with too much familiarity, bloating and thinness to truly thrive. Still, no matter how much potential goes betrayed, it is still done enough justice to make a pretty decent, and even well-produced western.\r\n\r\nThe production value of this particular, light-scale western is a little too subtle to be especially outstanding, but it is there, orchestrated by art director Leo K. Kuter in a tight fashion that is distinguished enough to draw you into the environment and draw this world about as, if not more colorfully than Jules Furthman's and Leigh Brackett's script. Well, perhaps the art direction does a more consistent job of selling the film, as the screenplay is formulaic, melodramatic and, of course, overblown, but it is still nonetheless clever, with some humor and memorable characterization, in addition to biting dramatic highlights that rally shine a light on the story concept's potential, no matter how limited. The 142-minute runtime wouldn't be as unreasonable as it very much is if the story concept was meaty enough to be more worthy of meaty ambition, which is still not unreasonable itself, as there is still a potential to this intriguing and sometimes colorful portrait on a sheriff's struggles on a path to fulfill justice, and the script, no matter how flawed, does more justice to such potential than Howard Hawks' direction. Hawks seems to understand the limitations of this drama, and therefore feels flat in enough ways for momentum to be retarded to the point of losing reward value, but when Hawks wakes up, momentum is restored, at least enough to entertain, with some effective highlights in genuine tension that actually use the cold storytelling effectively in establishing a certain quiet intrigue. Make no mistake, more than anything, the directorial highlights beget entertainment value that is still pretty limited in the long run, but it's not the only highlight, of which there are enough spread out throughout the near-two-and-a-half-hour runtime for the final product to border on rewarding, at least on the back of what is arguably the most consistently strong aspect. The acting is pretty decent, maybe even solid, for what it is, and while there isn't much to do here, whether it be Angie Dickinson as an intriguingly mysterious woman, or Walter Brennan as the colorfully chatty old deputy, or Dean Martin as a more frustrated and flawed man of justice, or John Wayne as a more soberly engaging, yet also flawed man of justice, there is deliverance across the board, as well as chemistry. Although the film boasts the length of an epic, it's about its characters, and their interactions, and no matter how flat the storytelling is, the performances have heart, of which there is still enough in other areas of filmmaking to make the final product endearing, even though it could have been more.\r\n\r\nAll in all, there's little that's new and plenty that's melodramatic in the draggy and often lazy-feeling telling of a story of only so much meat, thus, the final product falls as underwhelming, but not so deeply that production value, writing highlights, direction highlights and across-the-board enjoyable performances fail to drive Howard Hawks' \"Rio Bravo\" as a plenty entertaining, if plenty flawed western classic.\r\n\r\n2.75/5 - Decent",

Some little things don't always make sense or gel, but there are no glaring plot holes.  \n\nDon't just a shoot-em-up western, there is character development too, especially in the case of Dean Martin's character, and even some romance, though this is dealt with a touch superficially.\n\nGood action scenes, as you would expect from Howard Hawks and John Wayne.\n\nJohn Wayne is his usual cool, swaggering, albeit one-dimensional self.  Probably the best performance comes from Dean Martin, as his character has the most depth, and demons.\n\nAs if one singer in the cast wasn't enough, we have Ricky Nelson too.  Wasn't expecting much from him, but he is fine in his role as the Colorado kid.\n\nHaving Martin and Nelson in the movie means the producers are obliged to have a musical interlude.  It is fairly gratuitous, but I didn't mind it. Good music, well played and sung.\n\nAngie Dickinson provides the love interest, and does so very well.\n\nOnly blemishes are two of the supporting cast: Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez as Carlos and Walter Brennan as Stumpy.  You'd swear Gonzalez-Gonzalez's  performance inspired the character of Manuel in Fawlty Towers.  So clumsy and stereotypical it is irritating.  At least Manuel was funny.\n\nWalter Brennan's Stumpy talks far too much and complains far too much, about nothing.  Very irritating.  Hawks should have dialed him down a bit. \n\nA classic western.",

I also really enjoy John Wayne's performance. He is easily one of the best actor's of all time. John Wayne IS the greatest cowboy ever put on screen. He alone, can make a movie good solely based on how good of an actor he is. Stumpy was another character I liked. He was annoying at times, but I did find him to be pretty funny.

            "content": "\"Rio Bravo\" is likely the best Howard Hawks film and one of the best Westerns ever. It has John Wayne, Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, and Angie Dickinson. I had been wanting to see this for a while now, finally decided to watch it; John Wayne was the only person I was familiar with so I did not know what to expect. Wayne is more of a great personality than a great actor, still he is always convincing in his trademark role. The other actors are pleasant surprises, so is the film. The main story is about Sheriff Chance (Wayne) holding the brother of a wealthy land owner as a prisoner for murder as the wealthy brother tries to get him out with whatever means. It's quite unconventional for a Western and for the 50s; the romance, the eroticism between the lines, and the film's conclusion. The age difference between Wayne and Dickinson doesn't seem strange, I was pleasantly surprised at how well their romance works, and how much clever humor is put into the screenplay. John Wayne never gets out of his tough persona and he and Angie Dickinson are still able to melt my heart. The only thing that prevents it from being a masterpiece is its lack of a great (or even a decent) villain, when the main event takes place, it sort of falls flat; whatever potential John Russell as Nathan Burdette in his introductory scene had disappears in the climax because he doesn't get any scope. To some extent I did like the aftermath of it, which is why I think it's unconventional, it reminded me of a film made decades after in \"No Country for Old Men.\" Because of how it concludes, the decision the director takes regarding its climax, I am unsure about what the film is really trying to say. It works as a romance and a traditional Western, but I am not sure if it completely puts those two together into a single entity. \n\nThe other films I've seen of Hawks are: \"Bringing Up Baby,\" \"Scarface,\" \"His Girl Friday,\" and \"The Big Sleep.\" I really want to see \"Red River\" and \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.\"",

            "content": "Rio Bravo was a film I only picked up on when upon reading that it was John Wayne's response to High Noon, and when I came to the realisation that it was an influence over such quality action films as the John Carpenter classic Assault on Precinct 13 and the Arnold Schwarzenegger comeback The Last Stand I just had to see it for myself.\n\nBut really I was let down in certain areas. I found that for a film with a similar concept to High Noon which got its message across in 85 minutes which had finished its buildup of serious drama with a coup de grace of the one and only shootout in the film which made it awesome and memorable, whereas Rio Bravo took 141 long minutes, sub-intense drama, two short boring shootouts and the stereotypical slow pace. For a film with such a high-concept plot, really the key plot line1 sounds Better than it was actually executed since it's buried beneath a load of boring drama, western traditions and hilarious moments with Walter Brennan. Rio Bravo has an important story to tell and some interesting subplots, but it has way too many of them which prevents audiences from being easily able to connect with them or take interest in what is really going on with them.\nFor a film with such a high concept dramatic plot, I just found Rio Bravo to be a little too childish at the intro due to the way its musical score made so many moments into being cartoonish slapstick jokes, moments such as when people are getting injured or killed. It just isn't gritty, and grit is what John Wayne westerns are all about. I mean, one of his most famous is called True Grit, and there isn't much true grit in Rio Bravo. It falls under the more somewhat comedic category of his poor quality film Rooster Cogburn, and that's what it foreshadows the film to be. That's not what Rio Bravo turns out to be about, but even then that's a misleading intro. There are comedic elements\nThe drama of the story really surrounds the final shootout, but it fails to live up to all the buildup and hype that the characters put on it and frankly it's just dull and generic. It isn't intense, and really by that point with all the colours and humour it's been brought down to a family friendly level that it's more reminiscent of a cartoon with Road Runner and Elmer Fudd than a legitimate western. I mean elements of it are serious and some are fun, but director Howard Hawks fails find a balance between these or to balance the themes or pacing well, and so Rio Bravo is left as a film that you really have to save time to watch.\n\nBut visually, Rio Bravo is great because it's well lit and well shot with strong cinematography, and it's very colourful since the visual quality of the camera captures everything in each ground of the screen, and it breathes a good amount of colour into elements such as the tones of wood on the fence and the life in the grass of the background. It prevents Rio Bravo from falling into a visually dull quality that many other westerns before it have. Plus it's sufficiently scripted by ______ and _______, and so the drama the characters experience is explained well by them or to them, and therefore to the viewer.\nAnd John Wayne does make a powerful lead again. At 51 he never stops the heroism on screen and gives a strong performance which ties the scenes together. His natural western charisma is one of the best strengths of Rio Bravo.\nBut Walter Brennan gives the standout performance, one which is so comedically befitting that either the Academy Awards or Golden Globes should have been willing to recognise it. His stereotypical hillbilly character Stumpy is both strong and even more importantly, hilarious. For the man with 3 Academy Awards for Best Supporting actor, he again reminds us what makes him an excellent man of the supporting role by keeping the charms of Rio Bravo alive with a performance which is so goddamned funny that he saves Rio Bravo from being a generic western and makes it a comedic romp with hilarious voice articulation and line delivery. He is a man worth a million laughs, because half the time it's not what he says, it's how he says it. And sometimes it's even the fact that he is saying it. He alone is what makes Rio Bravo a positive quality film in my eyes, and he should have gotten a lot more screen time. Stumpy is an iconic western character thanks to Rio Bravo.\nAngie Dickinson was also a good mix of seductive and swift in her sexual appeal and line delivery respectively, and even though she was inconsistent at times and her character had some poorly written lines.\nDean Martin and Ricky Nelson were also good, Ricky Nelson in particular.\n\nSo Rio Bravo is overrated and overlong, but it's well acted and largely benefits from the comedic efforts of Walter Brennan, as well as being a very influential film.",

Of course, The Duke is awesome as usual.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPat Wheeler: I told him you were one of the best. \nColorado Ryan: Well, I'll tell you what I'm a lot better at, Mr. Wheeler... that's minding my own business.",

            "content": "If there's another actor you count on when it comes to the Western genre it's John Wayne. Rio Bravo is a Western classic combining the best from it ensemble with deep characters and direction that's perfect for the genre.\n\nRio Bravo is about a small-town sheriff in the American West enlisting the help of a cripple, a drunk, and a young gunfighter in his efforts to hold in jail the brother of the local bad guy. The pacing starts out slow and stays simple for quite awhile but once things start getting interesting you'll be hooked into it. The characters are fleshed out and full of depth. They are funny, serious, flawed, and most of all have a interesting friendship between our heroes. I did feel that the character of Colorado had little to do and only appeared when the plot needed him. The plot keeps getting better the longer you watch it as it's filled with intelligent heroes and a equally intelligent outlaw. These outlaw don't simply just walk into a saloon and starts shooting up the place. These outlaws devise plans that are interesting to see unfolding and builds tension as you'll never sure if our heroes will make it out alive. The dialogue is great and becomes memorable thanks the cast delivery of them. It filled with enough humor to make it enjoyable even when the drama starts building up. The plot might start out slow but great deep characters and a plot that takes interesting turns makes it worth sitting through.\n\nThe ensemble cast have great chemistry on screen, especially when John Wayne and Dean Martin share scenes. Walter Brennan is hilarious as the comic foil, John Wayne does a great job playing himself, and Dean Martin plays the complex and troubled drunk man convincingly. Ricky Nelson  was good as Colorado and manage to hold own screen convincingly with the legendary actors. He unfortunately didn't have much lines in the film which means you'll see him as part of the background. The cinematography is phenomenal doing more than just capturing the beauty of it scenery of it's setting. You'll always see characters placed in interesting places in a frame and adds atmospheric music to setup to scene if necessary to build a particular emotion. Great cinematography and a great cast helps Rio Bravo stand above in the Western gene.\n\nRio Bravo has a great plot, interesting characters, wonderful cast that deliver great performances as well being enjoyable in their roles, and perfect direction that does more than shows us great scenery. Rio Bravo is worth watching whether or not if you're a fan of Westerns.",

It has everything that the makes the genre great. It has tough leader, with two under respected helpers against a lot of bad guys. Then comes the young gunslinger to help out the undermanned sheriff. The setting looks great as a backdrop to the violence that ensues. It may be a tad bit longwinded, but the actors and plot will keep your attention for the 140 minute runtime.\n\nAt the beginning of the film, Chance arrests Joe Burdette for murder and locks him in the local jail. Joe's brother assembles a team to of hired hands to watch the town and make sure that the sheriff can't take Joe away from the town. Soon, a battle ensues between the authorities and Burdette. This plot has been used a million times since Rio Bravo, but never has it been done as well as it was here.\u00a0\n\nThis isn't my favorite Western, nor is it my favorite John Wayne movie, but it is one of the best in both categories. If you're a fan of the genre, there isn't much you can find to complain about here. It's right up there with Stagecoach, Once Upon a Time in the West, and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, when talking about the best of the genre. What makes it so great is Howard Hawk's wonderful direction and a big name cast that includes John Wayne, Dean Martin, and Ricky Nelson.\n\nRio Bravo is a must see for the casual and die hard film fan alike. There's a reason it has acquired its status as a genre masterpiece.\u00a0\n\nJohn T. Chance: Sorry don't get it done, Dude. That's the second time you hit me. Don't ever do it again.\u00a0",

The camera is all on him and he shines as his standard character type -- strong and not overly-wordy.\r\n2)  Originally, Montgomery Clift was cast as Dude, but Dean Martin stepped into the role surprisingly well, in one of his best roles.  \r\n3)  The pace of the film lags in places, and modern audiences may become impatient with the lack of action in areas.\r\n4)  The age gap between Wayne and his love interest (Angie Dickinson) is 25 years -- and it shows.  Dickinson holds her own against Wayne, but its not completely believable.\r\n\r\nWhy I gave it a 60%?  The \"romance\" was actually a distraction from the story.",

However, Wayne's likable performance coupled with Dean Martin's surprising turn as a drunk gunslinger makes this film worth watching, as well as occasionally funny and exciting, especially the closing sequence. Still though, how this is seen by many as one of the best movies ever is beyond me. It's just like \"The Searchers\", it bogs down from time to time and it goes on a little long, but when you have a master actor like Wayne at the helms, more than likely it will somehow, someway, still win you over at the end due to its irresistible charm despite its faults.",

Partially a response to Zimmerman's indictment of cold war cowardice \"High Noon\", Hawks exhaustively explores redemption and bravado. Yet, what sets this film apart from other testosterone charged westerns is that Hawks looks at the price of such courage.  Martin's ongoing quest for redemption amid the battle with the brutes feels very authentic and adds a surprising amount of emotional depth to a genre that allows no time for tears. \nAlso, Hawks adds a dose of realism to the film by having characters feel physically ill after a bout of violence.\nHowever, other than the touching character studies, I never really got a sense of what was at stake during this battle between good and evil. \nThe so called villians aren't really explored and by the time we reach the climactic final shoot out, it becomes really hard to care about who wins.\nThis is made worse by Hawks' idealism, which  often suffocates the realism that could have really made this film incredible. The good seem to always be in the right and one gets the feeling that Wayne's life is never at stake. In the final battle, Wayne is able to pretty much stand out in the open and experiences no danger. He is also able to hammer out any one liner he wants to, regardless of the impending doom.\nWayne's character is of the ilk that if a man is given a chance to do the right thing, he will. While I think this was probably a message that cold war audiences really needed to be fed, it detracts from the realism that Hawks explores elsewhere in the film. Sure Martin's character experiences hard times, but you know he will come surely come around. \nI suppose I set myself up for failure by watching a lot of Italian Westerns before this. After spending so much time with morally ambivalent characters, these characters seem a little too puffy at times to be taken too seriously.\nIt is an entertaining watch and Hawks is a phenomenal storyteller, I just think tonally he wanted it all in this film and it makes it feel inconsistent.",

Wanted to watch the original True grit, but it wasnt streaming on Netflix so I settled for another of John Waynes pictures.  \r\n\r\nOk, this is from 1959, so it looks old.  Though, it doesn't look 1959 old.  It looks 70s TV western old.  Still, it looks quite dated and doesnt seem to have the nice large EPIC shots of wagons roaming and lone men marching across desserts.  This movie does NOT feel epic in scope.  It feels contained and a little cheap for that reason (although it suits the story fine.)\r\n\r\nThe basic story is that John wayne is the sheriff and he has a guy in jail who his gangleading brother or friend wants to bust out.  Sherrif wayne needs to prevent a jailbreak for a few days until the county or state marshall comes to get the prisoner or something.  This is a simple story, but the movie is quite long and the focus often shifts to Dean Martins (good actor for a singer, the justin timberlake of his time) character who is a recovering alcoholic deputy and John Waynes love interest.  \r\n\r\nMy biggest problem with this western is that it didn't feel like a western.  It felt like a romance set in the old west.  The conflict with the prisoner and the gang was more like a problem for the developing relationship than a problem in and of itself.  Lots of old time \"romantic\" lines like, \"why'd you have to go and say a thing like that\".  But man Angie Dickinson is great in this.  Definately my favorite character in this flick.  SO while I liked the romance, I felt it detracted from the \"westerness\" of the picture.\r\n\r\nIve read that this film is supposed to be a reaction of sorts to High Noon, and maybe a greater understanding of that issue may lend some more weight to this picture, but it just feels so light.  They even break into a ridiculous song in the jail cell (now I get that scene in The Three Amigos).  All in all it was alright and maybe was GREAT back in 59.  It just doesn't hold up like the great spaghetti westerns or other John wayne movies like The Searches and Stagecoach.",

I only watched this film because I have always been a big Dean Martin Fan. However I like to watch all different kinds of movies, and study them, I guess that includes the American Western. I did like \"The Searchers\" though. Rio Bravo is a lot of fun with drama on the side. John Wayne does his usual, sort of \"acting\" but its mainly just him trying to look more manly and tougher than he actually is, however he actually kind of acts in the film, I guess he was so popular because he represented the stereotypical \"patriot\" a guy who used his words and was afraid to use violence. Dean Martin was actually a pretty damn good actor. Ricky Nelson did not have too hard of a role, he just kind of had to sit there and sing a little bit and there would be millions of girls flocking to the theater. Angie Dickinson really did not have to do a lot of acting either, she just had to sit there and look beautiful and maybe cry a little bit, just so she could say she did some acting. With this review one might think that I did not like the movie, well that's wrong. It probably the most enjoyable western I've ever seen, it's actually pretty well written and directed, and it's one that I would love to see again",

That's a huge reason why John Wayne was such a larger than life star because he was in so many westerns. Wayne gives an average performance as usual, and he's never been that great, but he's played some great characters and he doesn't so much do that here. However, Dean Martin stole the show as a former drunk turned deputy. I was skeptical at first. I'm like yeah, Sinatra could act, but what about Dean Martin? Twenty minutes in I'm like oh, he's good.

            "content": "Howard Hawks makes a western that is full of great characters, funny moments, and exciting action scenes.  John T. Chance is a normal man.  He doesn't know people are coming when they are behind him.  He is vulnerable. This makes the plot much more thrilling.  Chance is holding Joe in prison with Dude, Colorado, and Stumpy and they have to wait a week for him to be collected.  The only problem is that his brother is in town and he wants to get Joe no matter what it takes.  Dude is freshly off the booze and he is constantly being tempted by alcohol.  Colorado is a young gunman who is stuck because the man he came with was shot.  Stumpy is a crippled old man.  But as a team these guys are unstoppable.  Feathers is a woman who came to town and could leave, but instead she falls in love with Chance and skips out on the stagecoach leaving town.  Here comes the \"John Wayne is the man\" part of the story.  Even though he can lead these people to stop a gang of men from taking a prisoner out of jail, he also gets the most beautiful woman in town.  Everyone has their flaws, and everyone is a believable human being.  Howard Hawks creates a film that is exciting on plot, but is also filled as a character driven film.  Much better than I expected when it started.",

The result is a remarkably entertaining film that takes a simple premise -- a sheriff, his deputies, and a handful of decent folk must guard their town from criminal gunslingers -- and finds many moods, ranging from comical to tense to even introspective (thanks mainly to Martin's revelatory turn as a lawman trying to shake alcoholism). \n\nSo, between \"Noon\" and \"Bravo,\" which of these rival films is better? The answer is \"High Noon;\" it's tighter, more intense, more enduring, and more satisfactory than Hawks' rebuttal. However, \"Rio Bravo\" is still a classic of the Western genre, and though it meanders a bit too much, it's a master class in Hawks' ability to wrangle a great cast and dip his toe in multiple genres to almost peerless effect.",

Now with the outlaw's team of thugs trying to kill the law and break their leader out, the sheriff must deal with protecting the town, calming his troubled friend, and keeping his mind on his job and not the seductive lady coming on to him. This is a good Western with The Duke in his most heroic role. The mission of one man up against many problems. But no matter what, he always stays the hero and finds a way. The movie might be too long for my liking, and Walter Brennan doesn't help that he is the Western equivilant to Jar Jar Binks.\r\n\r\nAll set in a little, seemingly quiet town, the creation of the town is very well done and kept up with a good Western feel. But I like most of all how the movie's director, Howard Hawks, is able to show some really good emotional scenes with Dean Martin, and some really good suspenceful scenes. (my favourite being Dean Martin entering the tavern through the front door).\r\n\r\nDefinitely one of John Waynes most iconic movies, and being one of my favourite roles of Dean Martin.

            "content": "Along with True Grit, I finally got to see the classic Rio Bravo on TCM. So this was supposed to be the \"real\" spirit of the West opposed to Cooper's \"High Noon\". A fashion conscious sheriff who wears a red shirt on one day and a blue on the next, I wonder who does his laundry? A drunkard and an old geezer as his wingmen, a \"funny\" stereotype Mexican couple who run a hotel, a dance hall girl who has a crush on the sheriff, and a saloon keeper. Not to mention lots and lots of firearms and ammo for everybody. In the beginning there are quite a few people on the streets, later the town seems to be deserted except for the mentioned individuals plus an unspecified amount of hired gunmen out to free an imprisoned murderer.\r\n\r\nWhere did all the people of the little town go? They just disappear without any trace. My guess is that there was much more gun action than shown on screen and that many good citizens succumbed under the \"friendly fire\" of the forces of the law. John Wayne and his companions are nervous and extremely trigger happy, the sheriff's plan to hold out alone and wait for the Marshall to pass through the town does not seem to be dictated by common sense (there would have been alternatives) but by personal pride. There is no interaction whatsoever between him and the community he is supposed to serve. Frankly, the sheriff seems to be a pretty irresponsible guy with the mind of an adolescent - and responsibility was the main theme of High Noon, a film, it must be said, of a different league.\r\n\r\nThe main protagonists have to deliver long, winding, unnatural monologues as to their motives and feelings, which makes the movie also slow at times. This surplus of talk unfortunately does not give it or its message more substance but harms it suspense-wise. As for the performances, John Wayne is always John Wayne. He doesn't really act (Stagecoach the exception) but his mere presence just finalizes the job. Ricky Nelson was also a complete misfit, simply in this film because of his heartthrob status he had back then. Amidst the general mediocrity, the brilliant performance of Dean Martin (I was surprised since I heard he was a terrible actor) as the alcoholic who wants to regain his standing among men stands out clearly. The same can be said for the use of music which is beautiful but somewhat irrelevant. In the end, I found Rio Bravo unconvincing and filled with inconsistencies with the filmmaking; the only bright spot was Martins role. \r\n\r\nStory: C\r\nActing: B\r\nDirection: C-\r\nVisuals: C+ \r\nOverall: C\r\n\r\n** out of 4 stars",

            "content": "\"Rio Bravo\" is one of those relaxed, slow paced westerns filled with mysterious characters. Though it was made in response to the film \"High Noon,\" it follows patterns similar to the masterpiece and my favourite western of them all, \"Shane,\" in which a bunch of mysterious characters (played by John Wayne, Dean Martin, and Ricky Nelson) protect a town from a bunch of villainess cowboys from running in. It is like \"Shane\" times three, since there are more heroes and villains alike. Also noticeable is the reluctant affair between Angie Dickinson and Waynes' characters, similar to that of Alan Ladd and Jean Arthur potential love interest in \"Shane,\" only in \"Rio Bravo,\" it does blossom by the end in something big. Despite its relaxed pace, Rio Bravo is an absolutely beautiful western under Howard Hawks. It is fascinating to watch, well-acted, filled with a unique array characters, and has a bizarrely intriguing plot. It is indeed a great piece of work, and, like \"Shane,\" one of the best westerns of them all.",

I have to watch True Grit and see why the fuck he got an Oscar. But if it was a life achievement kind of thing, then I feel pity for the Hollywood society (even more than I did before).\r\nAnyway, I heard so much about Rio Bravo. Tarantino calls it one of the best films of all time (but then again, he also says Taxi Driver is... lol).\r\nHoward Hawks a legend? Well, if this is his masterpiece, then he certainly is as much legend as Ed Wood or Mel Brooks.\r\nI know that Rio Bravo is kind of a comedy. But isn't it sad if the funniest scene is one that isn't supposed to be funny? And I'm talking about the opening sequence in the bar, where Dean Martin hits John Wayne with a club, and that other guy kills someone. I rolled on the floor for that scene's ridiculosity...\r\nI mean, it's not like it's the worst movie ever. The chick was pretty hot. The Mexican guy was funny too.

But, you knew that already otherwise you wouldn't have set things up the way you did. \r\nNathan Burdette: Just what have I done? \r\nJohn T.

He committed twenty murders you'd try and see he didn't hang for 'em. \r\nNathan Burdette: I don't like that kinda talk. Now you're practically accusing me... \r\nJohn T.

I don't like your men watching us, trying to catch us with our backs turned. And I don't like it when a friend of mine offers to help and twenty minutes later he's dead!

Chance: What is it? \r\nColorado Ryan: Well, they call it the \"Deg\u00c3 1/4ello\"... the cutthroat song. The Mexicans played it for those Texas boys when they had 'em bottled up in the Alamo. \r\nJohn T. Chance: Yeah. \r\nColorado Ryan: Played it day and night 'til it was all over.

The next time someone throws a dollar into a spittoon, don't expect me to do anything about it. Just get down on your knees and get it. \r\n[Dude angrily backhands Chance] \r\nDude: I'm... sorry. \r\nJohn T. Chance: Sorry don't get it done, Dude. That's the second time you hit me. Don't ever do it again. \r\n\r\n\r\nPat Wheeler: [Chance needs help to fight Burdette and his men] What about my drivers? You could use them. \r\nJohn T. Chance: Supposing I got 'em. What'd I have? Some well-meaning amatuers, most of 'em worried about their wives and kids. Burdette has 30 or 40 men, all professionals. Only thing they're worried about is earning their pay. No, Pat. I'd just be giving them more targets to shoot at. A lot of people'd get hurt. Joe Burdette isn't worth it. He isn't worth one of them that'd get killed. \r\nPat Wheeler: Then what are you gonna do? All you got for help is that old man down at the jail and this... \r\n[indicating Dude] \r\nDude: [Spanish for drunk] Borrachon's the name, Mr. Wheeler. I'll step outside so you can talk more freely. \r\n\r\n\r\nJohn T. Chance: [Referring to Colorado] It's nice to see a smart kid for a change. \r\nStumpy: Yeah, he ain't like the usual kid with a gun. \r\nDude: Wonder if he's as good as Wheeler said? \r\nJohn T. Chance: I'd say he is. \r\nJohn T. Chance: I'd say he's so good, he doesn't feel he has to prove it. \r\n\r\n\r\nStumpy: Joe don't get no sugar in his coffee; he just gets water poured over the grounds. \r\n\r\n\r\n[last lines] \r\nStumpy: You think I'll ever get to be a sheriff? \r\nDude: Not unless you mind your own business. \r\n[Stumpy cackles]",

I only watched this film because I have always been a big Dean Martin Fan. However I like to watch all different kinds of movies, and study them, I guess that includes the American Western. I did like \"The Searchers\" though. Rio Bravo is a lot of fun with drama on the side. John Wayne does his usual, sort of \"acting\" but its mainly just him trying to look more manly and tougher than he actually is, however he actually kind of acts in the film, I guess he was so popular because he represented the stereotypical \"patriot\" a guy who used his words and was afraid to use violence. Dean Martin was actually a pretty damn good actor. Ricky Nelson did not have too hard of a role, he just kind of had to sit there and sing a little bit and there would be millions of girls flocking to the theater. Angie Dickinson really did not have to do a lot of acting either, she just had to sit there and look beautiful and maybe cry a little bit, just so she could say she did some acting. With this review one might think that I did not like the movie, well that's wrong. It probably the most enjoyable western I've ever seen, it's actually pretty well written and directed, and it's one that I would love to see again.",

            "content": "It's been said that John Wayne was so appalled at the notion that a U.S. Marshall would beg his townsfolk, townsfolk with families, for help in a showdown that he and director Howard Hawks responded to it with Rio Bravo, a film that is the complete opposite of High Noon in every way. Unlike other westerns, Hawks' film takes place mostly in claustrophobic areas such as the hotel rooms and hallways as well as the jailhouse. Furthermore, where High Noon's run time takes place in almost real time around 85 minutes, Rio Bravo takes it's time with a leisurely pace of nearly 2 and a half hours (taking place in three days) to tell this tale of Sheriff John T. Chance (John Wayne) on a border town who arrests a murderer, who's gang, he promises, will take revenge on Chance. Unlike Gary Cooper's character in High Noon, John Wayne's character has a handful of people that are willing to help him out, all of which he entrusts to do so because he knows they can handle the job. One of the people he puts his trust on is a drunken deputy named Dude (Dean Martin) who, while he hasn't lost all of his skill, just isn't the same as he used to be. Walter Brennan is the toothless, crippled old deputy who guards the jail cells. Ricky Nelson plays Colorado Ryan, a young gunman who arrives in town with Chance's old friend, trail boss Pat Wheeler (Ward Bond in his final film). Wheeler offers his and his men's services in helping Chance as deputies but Chance turns his offers down as they're not \"professionals\" but Chance does ask Colorado for his services, though he initially turns him down. Angie Dickinson, a very sexy Dickinson, plays Wayne's love interest, Feathers, a dance hall entertainer that arrives in town and nearly gets locked up by Chance for cheating at cards, until he finds out that he was wrong and that she isn't guilty. Wheeler is later murdered by one of Nathan Burdette's (John Russell) hired guns. Dude kills the hired gun in a confrontation inside a saloon. Colorado joins Chance after his boss is killed and takes over for what Dude can't handle. Burdette eventually takes Dude and holds him up for an exchange for his brother Joe (Claude Akins). This leads the men to the final confrontation between Chance and Burdette, where the dynamite-filled wagons brought into town by the murdered Wheeler play a crucial role in beating Burdette and his men.\n\nRight-wingers John Wayne and Howard Hawks created a classic western that is in many ways, THE quintessential western. It is a western that holds up as high as any of John Ford's classics. It works on all levels with great character development, some good shootouts and masterful direction from one of the best, Howard Hawks. John Wayne is as good as ever as the sheriff of the small town; Dean Martin is great as alcoholic deputy who tries to lay off of the hooch but whenever he does he begins to get the shakes and ends up back on the bottle, causing him to be less skillful with his gun; and Walter Brennan as usual brings most of the humor to film. Ricky Nelson and the beautiful Angie Dickinson are also excellent in their roles. It's safe to say everyone brings their A game. Besides the exploding (literally!) finale, one of the highlights of the film is a very light moment where Dean Martin sings a song with Ricky Nelson playing his acoustic guitar and Walter Brennan on the harmonica. It just wouldn't be right to have a movie starring Martin and Nelson and not have them sing something; luckily for us, they sing two songs. The scene where Dean Martin kills the man hiding at the top of the saloon is another big highlight of the film. In fact, the whole film is one long, leisurely paced highlight. It's just a movie that is enjoyable from beginning to end. It stands as one of the best examples of a truly great western, one that ranks high on the list of classic traditional westerns along with The Searchers, Stagecoach, Red River, Shane and High Noon. Rio Bravo is essential viewing for fans of the western genre, there's no other way to put it. 10/10",

            "content": "Western  directed by Howard Hawks.It stars John Wayne, Dean Martin, and Ricky Nelson, with the beautifun and exotic Angie Dickinson, Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez, Ward Bond, and Walter Brennan.\r\nThe film was shot at Apacheland Movie Ranch, just outside Apache Junction, Arizona.\r\nRio Bravo is generally regarded as one of Hawks' best, and is notable for its scarcity of close-up shots. Only three appear in \"Rio Bravo.\" In the opening scene where Joe shoots an unarmed man: Joe's revolver is shown in close-up, when he rolls a cigarette, and later when Dude pours the whiskey back into a bottle. It features a long opening scene with absolutely no dialogue.\r\nThe musical score was composed by Dimitri Tiomkin. His score contains the haunting tune \"El Deg\u00fcello\", which is played several times to build tension. A character (Colorado, played by Nelson) identifies the tune as \"The Cutthroat Song\". He relates the song's historical playing on the orders of Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna to the Texans holed up in the Alamo to signify that no quarter would be given. The tune was used in the following year, over the opening credits of Wayne's film, The Alamo. Composer Ennio Morricone recalled director Sergio Leone requesting him to write \"Dimitri Tiomkin music\" for A Fistful of Dollars. The trumpet theme is similar to Tiomkin's \"Deguella\" while the Italian title of Rio Bravo was Un Dollaro D'onore.\r\nBecause the film starred a crooner, Martin, and a teen idol, Nelson, Hawks included three songs in the soundtrack. Before the big showdown, in the jail house, Martin sings \"My Rifle, My Pony, and Me\" (which contained new lyrics to a Tiomkin tune that appeared in Red River) accompanied by Nelson, after which Nelson sings a brief version of \"Get Along Home, Cindy\", accompanied by Martin and Brennan. Over the closing credits, Martin, backed by the Nelson Riddle Orchestra, sings a specially composed song, \"Rio Bravo.\" Nelson later paid homage to both the film and his character, Colorado, by including the song \"Restless Kid\" on his 1959 LP, Ricky Sings Again.\r\nA brief clip from Rio Bravo was among the archive footage later incorporated into the opening sequence of Wayne's last film, The Shootist, to illustrate the backstory of Wayne's character.\r\nSimply one of the best westwrns ever made.Dry and direct like a shot this movie makes we want to see more and more westerns.In my collection now.",

            "content": "It's not hard to recognize a classic when you'll see one. In most cases the great movies are established with great characters. It shows also in this 50's piece of US Wester brilliance.\n\nSheriff Chance is the main character -who played by John Wayne- has a very minimalistic approach on everything, a sturdy presence of a man who mostly communicates only when needed and even then with only simple lines or complete one-liners. That is enough because he (both Wayne and his character) suit the movie really well and it's easy to see there's good chemistry between the leading man and the supporting acts. \n\nBut supporting acts are really the ones that steal the show here. Stumpy (Brennan) is one of the most memorable characters I've witnessed on the screen in a long time. A grumpy old man who has crippled leg but is still the most reliable foe when needed. He deliveres some really good dialogue and is also the welcomed comic relief (still not in a corny way!) amonside the drama and action. \"Feathers\", the woman in the centre of the movie (Dickinson) stays a bit distant at times but that is good as the westerns are not about romance. She still stands her ground with cleverly delivered dialogue and is equipped with nice looks suited well for this era. Colorado (Nelson) is a good characted also as a \"trigger happy youth\" but I'm not sure about the casting of Nelson as he seems a bit too polished with his white smirk amongs the more grittier characters usually spotted around the West.\n\nLast centric character, \"Dude\", is played by Dean Martin. Martin of course more known as a singer and part of the \"Rat pack\" that included Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. I will just tell you that I'm sure he surprises a lot of people with his performance, at least the uneducated ones who are not familiar with his acting side. It was usual for the stars in the early-midst 20th century to both sing and act (Elvis, Sinatra all did it) but if you forget for a while that he is a singer you just notice his delivering a really good performance. He has a sort of problem with the alcohol to say the least ;)\n\nHaving seen a bunch of westerns I think Rio Bravo stands on it's own table in it's own saloon. It isn't the usual American Western with the indians and trains etc, nor does it have the artistic touch and feel of the Italo Westerns a'la Leone. Even being situated in a singe town the movie has everything to be worth of one's free time; action, drama, good dialogue, great characters and even some western type singing. I'm glad I have a couple of more westerns still waiting to be watched as Rio Bravo has set the bar pretty high for the non-Leone classics I haven't seen yet.",

            "content": "Who says that the old west is out of style? This is my first exposure to director Howard Hawks, and I am now more than sold on his character building abilities. I wouldn't be surprised if I found out he was an inspiration to J.J Abrams, another director who creates such fascinating characters with uncanny depth. With Rio Bravo, Sheriff Chance (John Wayne) has captured a brother of a famous ranch owner for murder. The ranch owner named Joe Burdette (Claude Akins) vows that he will do everything he can to break his brother free. Chance enlists the help of a drunk sharpshooter simply named \"Dude\" (Dean Martin), an old geyser Stumpy (Walter Brennan) and a sharp, young quick draw Colorado (Ricky Nelson). Together they form an alliance to fight off all the accomplices and plans that Joe throws at them. Hawks dives right into the thick of things with an opening bar sequence that is wordless. Off we go to the jail, then the fun begins. Rio Bravo is not only satisfying on a level of excitement, but also on a level of intimacy with the characters. Many scenes hold your interest as the characters banter and converse back and forth. Sometimes it is comedic, sometimes dramatic. It even gets romantic when a mysterious woman card player only known as Feathers (Angie Dickinson) enters the mix. These performances are so good. They are forced to face their faults and the scenes are delivered so well. I wish I knew these characters in real life. Rio Bravo is a great western that has an incredibly high entertainment value, even for today's generation. Bravo Mr. Hawks, bravo!\r\n\r\nThe plot is simple enough which allows for these characters to grow. Wayne has the straight man role as Sheriff Chance. It's obvious he is a good sheriff and he always means well, which is why he doesn't just shoot first and ask questions later. He believes in giving an honest man a chance. \"Wait for the Marshall,\" he always says. Colorado enters the fray when a stagecoach escort enters town. You can tell Chance sees himself in Colorado. Young, smart, full of ambition and promise. Colorado is such a fascinating character because he seems to be so much smarter than the average teen around those times. He is not out getting drunk and making a fool out of himself, he can shoot a gun and he is crafty. The scene where some gun men hold up Chance is a fantastic scene that is so slick, if you blink you miss it. \r\n\r\nThen, we have two performances that really outshine the rest of the stellar cast. Dean Martin as Dude is so complex and motivational. He is a man who finds his refuge in drinking his sorrows away. The only problem with this is, he is trying to quit. His hands shake as he tries to fight off the urge. He has lost his youth to a stupid addiction. You fall so hard for him as he breaks down and gives up. When Colorado is given a deputy job in place of Dude, he asks Chance \"Is he as good as I used to be?\" These devastating lines strip Dude down to rags. He has lost his way and all hope seems to be lost for this honest and well-meaning man. \r\n\r\nThen we have the gorgeous Angie Dickinson playing Feathers, a woman who seems to be a gambling con thief who Chance accuses and finds out that she isn't exactly guilty. She finds immediate interest for the man in uniform, but she isn't a simple bimbo. Chance wants her to get on the stagecoach and head out of town for safety, but she stays, because she wants to be around Chance some more. When she is confronted by Chance as to why she didn't leave, she nails him with her wit. He says she should stop wearing those feathers, and she replies \"That's what I would do if I were the kind of girl you think I am.\" This girl plays mind games like there is no tomorrow. The edge between Chance and Feathers is infectious. In an incredible drunk scene, Feathers rambles on and on, sometimes not even making sense. Dickinson steals all of the scenes she is in because of her beauty and her sly, sensual tone she adds to her lines. \r\n\r\nIf I had any complaints about Rio Bravo its that some of these characters were underused. The Mexican bar owner named Carlos (Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez) just comes in and out of the movie like a chicken with his head cut off delivering news or panic. He was a tad annoying because he really had no purpose other than a few sporadic laughs and necessary lines to move the plot forward. He was definitely out of place in the films finale when he brought some shells to help Chance. Why would he do something like this? We see he can't even shoot a gun properly.\r\n\r\nThere is also a massive under-usage of the villain Joe Burdette. Much like Carlos, he arrives and leaves very quickly. He is sort of the mysterious, distant villain that I really wanted to know better. It's obvious this guy is smart, with all the plans he set up for Chance and the gang, but I would have preferred to see him more. Instead of being the ghost running the show, why not be the bad guy with balls? I would have preferred he showed his face more often and was more of a threat. He only seems to threaten with his social status and large amount of money to pay off his villains. The pay off would have been better if Joe proved he can shoot with the best of them. Still, Joe is a decent villain with obvious motivation, he just seemed to be missing from many scenes.\r\n \r\nHowever, when the film reaches the grand finale, only then do you start to realize just how awesome all of these characters were. Stumpy is a prime example of comic relief. He is always mumbling and grumbling especially when he gets made fun of. He is a cantankerous old man, he knows that, so he has a ball with it. Particularly in the finale when the dynamite starts to fly, he spouts a classic line. \"Hey Dude! How do you like them apples?\" Classic. Once the characters begin to sing \"My Rifle, My Pony, and Me\" you know that we have something special. Over a simple moment of peace and relaxation, these characters flourish. Howard Hawks fills these characters with so much emotion and credibility, you wish that they existed. Who wouldn't want to just hang out and have a beer with people like this? Hawks uses that audience bondage to craft an impeccable western that is simple and striking. Rio Bravo flies on the strength of its actors, the simplicity of its plot and the wonderful direction by Hawks. After Rio Bravo was done, I was shouting for an encore.",

The cast doesn?t end there though, Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson are a wonderful supporting team that gives so much to the lovable nature of the film itself. Walter Brennan as Stumpy still makes me laugh, by far the greatest comedic relief to ever exist in a single movie. The story is pretty interesting in that it has about four central plots going on at the same time, but it works wonderfully and feels more natural than just having a simple jail defense for two and a half hours.

The plot is smart and suspenseful, peppered with some memorable shootouts, but the true appeal of Rio Bravo is the characters. They're deeply likable in general, and the movie's leisurely, down-to-earth pacing lets them just hang out plenty, with witty dialogue and one warm scene where they all sing together. So while Rio Bravo might not be the most overwhelmingly impressive movie ever made, it's so likable, cozy and (at times) suspenseful that I easily fell in love with it.",

            "content": "Grade: A+\r\n\r\nThe Greatest Films\r\n\r\nRio Bravo is a Howard Hawks Western. As far as archetypal Westerns go, this film is pretty damn great. John Wayne plays Sheriff John t. Chance of a small western town, as he and his 3 deputies attempt to stave off a posse of bandits working for a rich rancher  for six days as they hold the rancher's murderer brother in jail; the bandits would like him released. Chance intends to turn the murderer over to the marshal, who supposedly will arrive in six days. \r\n\r\nWalter Brennan plays a cripple whose job it is to guard the cell. He does a good job of bringing a little straight humour to a sometimes overly dry film as far as dialogue (the formality is sometimes overbearing). Then there is Dean Martin who plays Dude, an extremely talented sharpshooter officer, except he has a serious vice in his alcoholism; the film basically follows Dean's character in his  moral and mental struggle between upholding the law while keeping a job or falling back into alcoholic binges. Dean's character Dude is attempting to keep it together during this particularly dangerous time.\r\n\r\nAngie Dickinson is the Sheriff's love interest, who doubles as an aid to him in some tight spots with the bandits as well. The love story is mildly interesting, and perhaps a bit risqu\u00e9 for a Western and it's better than most Western love stories. Thankfully though, it never gets in the way of the main plot, and invites a bit of Western style relationship humour.\r\n\r\nThe film is very deliberately paced, sometimes a bit too slow, but the pace does evoke the long haul of the six days, as they wait for the murderer's brother to arrive, and then stave him and his posse off repeatedly. A handful of tense encounters between both sides, both using dialogue and with gun slinging, add excitement to the film.  \r\n\r\nAs the days wear on, a young gunslinger by the name of Colorado (Ricky Nelson) catches the eye of Chance, who feels he could use his skills to fight the bandits. Part of the plot involves the increasing trust between Chance and Colorado, and the building of their mutual respect. As the sheriff and his men speak of Colorado: \r\n\r\nJohn T. Chance: [Referring to Colorado] it's nice to see a smart kid for a change. \r\nStumpy: Yeah, he ain't like the usual kid with a gun. \r\nDude: Wonder if he's as good as Wheeler said? \r\nJohn T. Chance: I'd say he is. \r\nJohn T. Chance: I'd say he's so good, he doesn't feel he has to prove it.\r\n\r\nColorado is an interesting part to the film, and pretty much represents the antithesis of Dean Martin's character, even if they both have similar qualities.\r\n\r\nThe film has a number of great sequences, including one in a bar when Chance and Dude are looking for a hiding bandit, and enter the bar looking for him. The final shootout is pretty wild and entertaining as well; its funny how all the main players show up during the climax; contrived yes, but the way they are depicted in these situations is what makes it memorable, despite any notion of implausibility.\r\n\r\nMy knowledge of Westerns is over time becoming more and more, and this is one of the better ones I have seen. With a cast like this and a Director of Hawks stature, I knew this was one I had to cross off my invisible must-see list; I was more than satisfied.",

In the years since its release in 1959,the film has been re-made twice as a Western , and also provided the inspiration for John Carpenter's 'Assault on Precinct 13' (1976.) Hawks' film itself was actually inspired by another Western, which was released seven years earlier. Fred Zinnemann's 'High Noon' (1952), starred Gary Cooper as a town sheriff, who finds himself the target of a vengeful criminal, whom he bought to justice years earlier. Alone against his enemy, Cooper's sheriff appeals to his townspeople for help, and none of them answer this call, leaving him to fight alone. Both Hawks and Wayne believed that a sheriff would never act in this manner and consequently, whilst various people offer to help Wayne's sheriff, he rejects their assistance, preferring to stand alone. For the most part the film eschews the expansive outdoor locales and vistas which characterise many Westerns, and is principally shot inside, which helps create a sense of claustrophobia. The performances of the lead characters complement each other very well, with Walter Brennan providing some very funny comic relief. Meanwhile Hawks' direction is typically assured throughout, not least in the opening scenes of the film, completely bereft of dialogue.",

It also features some of Hawks' other motifs including the Hawksian girl and preserving one's self-respect. It feature's Hawks' typical fast pace, eye-level, objective camera work, focus on gestures, and overlapping dialogue. \n\nA good place to start with if you want to get into Hawks' films or if you want to just have a good time. Speaking of gestures, the opening scene features one the greatest uses of silence ever committed to film.",
