            "content": "Absolutely surprising carnivorous bats tale , derived from abysmal story . The film starts in Skull Valley , Arizona, where the scientific Casper (Dina Meyer) and his assistant Jimmy (Leon) are investigating about bats . They're brought by a government scientist (Bob Gunton) to a small town called Callup , in Texas . There appears a pack of carnivorous bats that prey on citizens , terrorizing the small community . The chiroptera specialist Casper , his helper , along with a policeman (Lou Diamond Phillips) attempt to stop the genetically altered flying foxes before the military comes into action , bombing the caves.This is a slam-bang chiller about flying foxes , full of scares and lots of blood and gore . It delivers the goods with suspense , tension and hair-raising chills ; plus , the astonishing special effects of this nature , as the ferocious bats seem alive . It's an eerily effective thriller , quite entertaining , though many will undoubtedly find repulsive when the bats attack and eat their victims . The tale can't bear such close scrutiny , but while this thrills ride is going, you won't mind . With a final budget of 5.25 million, the film went on to gross well over 30 million worldwide in theatrical , DVD , Digital and Television sales . Although considered somewhat unsuccessful at the time, the film recouped its entire budget during its first week of release . The vampire bats are splendidly made by means of Animatronics in charge of Robert Zurtzman , Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger . The bats in the film were a combination of Animatronics, CGI , and 2 live bats. The 2 original bats in the film were brought over from Indonesia . The acting is uneven , an attractive Dina Meyer , Lou Diamond Phillips as the patrolman who along with the scientific facing off the creepy bats and killing them in their caves . Bob Gunton is an oddball baddie acting as a mad doctor and the comic relief in charge of Leon . Interesting screenplay by John Logan , today writer for blockbusters (Aviator , Last Samurai , Star Trek : nemesis , Time machine) . Produced in just under 6 months , the picture continues to hold one of the top spots for fastest produced 35mm feature films to receive a wide-release . The motion picture was well directed by Louis Morneau , in his best movie . He's a B series director, with no much success (Hitcher 2 , Retroactive , Quake , Soldier Boyz , Carnosaur 2). With similar premise , ten years earlier (79) was shot the movie titled \u00a8Nightwing\u00a8\u00a8 directed by Arthur Hiller with Nick Mancuso , David Warner and Kathryn Harrold , but it was a flop, this one is a superior film .",

            "content": "Bats is a very generic late-'90s killer animal flick that follows most of the genre rules to the letter. All of the expected characters are present and correct\u2014untrustworthy government scientist, brave local sheriff, doomed-to-die deputy, dedicated (and sexy) animal expert, wise-cracking sidekick\u2014and the plot develops in an extremely predictable manner, opening with young couple alone in the dark falling victim to the bats, before introducing a whole townful of potential victims, and climaxing with our brave heroes risking their lives in a showdown against the deadly critters.It all gets very silly at times, with perhaps the most unbelievable scene being the securing and electrification of a whole school by just four people in the space of a few hours, but it still proves to be quite a bit of fun, director Louis Morneau keeping the action moving at such a swift pace that such nonsense is fairly easy to forgive (unlike the director's tendency to 'skew', stretch and blur the image during the frenzied bat attacks, which I found bloody irritating).What really helps to elevate this formulaic nonsense to slightly-above-average are the solid cast and some fairly decent special effects. Dina Meyer (of Starship Troopers fame) and Lou Diamond Phillips make for a likable protagonists, and Leon is far less objectionable as 'token comedy relief black guy' than one might expect. As for the bats, they're a mixture of more than reasonable CGI and nifty puppetry from KNB; my only gripe, FX-wise, is a lack of splatter\u2014a bit more gore would have been very welcome.",

But at home, I watched it with an undemanding mood, and with the feeling this was a basic update of a low budget animal-attacking movie of the '70s. Seeing it that way, the movie was good enough to pass the time. No more, but I wasn't bored.Certainly, there's a lot of the movie that's dumb. Some of the puppets and computer generated effects look really bad. The black character is only there for humor, and his treatment is somewhat offensive. Lou Diamond Phillips can't act. Sometimes you can't tell what's going on with all the close-ups of flapping wings and bad editing.There are a few good things. Some of the cliches I was expecting actually didn't happen. (For one thing, the authorities are quick to the danger for once.) The cinematography is excellent, and occasionally the movie has a \"big\" feeling that makes it look more expensive that its $6.5 million budget.So if you like B movies, are feeling undemanding, and can see it cheaply or for free, you might want to give it a try.",

            "content": "As usual, I find myself on the opposing side of the critics. This movie has NO BUSINESS in the bottom 100 here at IMDb! It's FAR from a masterpiece, but it's also just as far from deserving that low a rating.As is often the case, whenever you have a good monster/creature feature, lurking somewhere in the shadows is a mad scientist. Such is the case in this film. In fact, I found the mad scientist a tad too mad. I think that is the main contributor to the low ratings this movie receives here at IMDb. The \"doctor's\" performance went WAY over the top. Well, he's supposed to be insane, but he plays it like pure camp, and that's horribly out of place in this otherwise serious work concerning a lab experiment gone awry...or has it?The animated/CGI bats are well done, and all performances besides the doctor are enjoyable and on target. Unfortunately, he was bad enough to have brought down the whole film.This is fun, generates some good suspense, and isn't afraid to show you the nemesis. The story itself is quite competent to hold up, and does, IF you can ignore the wretched performance given by Bob Gunton. I must say that I do not believe it to be wholly his fault, as he has given some great performances in the past, and since. The fault must lie with the director, Louis Morneau, who has never done much of note.I like this film and can enjoy it, in spite of the doctor, and do find myself watching it from time to time.It rates a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",

            "content": "\"Bats\" was a treasure i found on the shelves of Blockbuster video way back in the 90's, a great time to be obsessed with movies like i was as there was constantly new & exciting looking movies out all the time & with Cool artwork on the covers & one that caught my eye was BATS.The case looks Awesome & the cast was great with the super stunning & beautiful DINA MEYER, who i loved from Starship Troopers, here she was with the Cool LOU DIAMOND PHILLIPS (Young Guns flicks) as the two leads in a Creature Feature about killer mutant Bats & i was sold.Although \"Bats\" is a B-movie at heart it still had a very decent budget of around 5 million & every penny is well spent in it's production. The look & setting is perfect B-movie Horror with it's All American little town that gets attacked by mutant bats, it's a great setting that felt like \"Critters\" or something & our two leads are great together with sexy Meyer as an expert/scientist type & Philips as the tough local Sheriff, a perfect old school 1950's sci-fi B-movie story just transported to the 90's.The special effects are fantastic as they use everything from practical puppets & c.g.i to real Bats & all expertly done. Great mutant bat designs.The music is exciting & there's some really thrilling set pieces such as the Town attack sequence!!! A few years later i felt the same sort of sequence of the towns full attack was very similar in another Throwback B-movie Creature Feature called \"Eight Legged Freaks\" the big budget spider movie. I love these small towns under attack from creatures films & \"Bats\" is one of my favourites, a real GEM.\"Bats\" is pure 90's Monster fun & a great late-night film & a treasure amongst the B-movies of the 90's & with two good leads.This is what the direct-to-video market was all about, good entertainment & a fun nights viewing.",

            "content": "\"Bats\" had its theatrical run and was widely distributed on rental VHS/DVD. Videostores carried multiple copies which got rented fluently. Yet from the looks of it - its rating on here - most people thought this was bad. Boy, have they not seen 'bad' yet. Things would get a lot worse in years to come with these type of films. For one thing, try watching the alleged sequel to \"Bats\" called \"Bats: Human Harvest\". The thing was made in 2007, for TV and then dumped to DVD as well. Go watch it; it's about 5 times worse than this film. Then come back and tell me which is the bad film out of those two. Or go watch \"Fangs\" from 2001 (starring Corbin Bernsen). It's the silly version of \"Bats\". I tell you, things can get a lot worse than this modest piece of killer bats entertainment. It even stars Lou Diamond Phillips and Dina Meyer. In 'worse' movies, you can't even count on a cast like this anymore. So why the complaints & puss-poor ratings on here?I've seen quite some crappy horror-movies already, and you can say what you want about \"Bats\", but it's not a bad movie. Clich\u00e9d? Yes, kind of. Seen it all before? Yes, most likely. But the production values are more than just okay. It's well made. It looks good. Good camera work. The acting is more decent than what you normally can expect from a movie like this these days (like stuff produced by Sci-Fi Channel, The Asylum, need I continue?). I've seen much, much worse special effects when it comes to the CGI used in this one. And there are actually some cool shots of animatronic bats to be admired (from puppets with full body movement to close-ups of their heads with moving ears, grinning teeth and blinking eyes - it's always a kick to see SFX artists go the extra mile on this). The film's fairly fast-paced, keeps you going and never gets boring. It's basically a B-movie that looks damn good, sort of like stuff similar to \"Tremors\" (a fine early 90's monster movie classic) and its sequels. Or if you bump down the ladder a bit, you'll find a lot more (lower budgeted) genre outings telling pretty much the same story (\"Skeeter\" from 1993 comes to mind).Of course \"Tremors\" works better on a variety of levels and \"Bats\" isn't as great by a long shot. For one thing, it misses some wit, and that black guy (Leon playing Jimmy Sands) trying to provide it didn't do a lot of good either. Still, a fun popcorn-movie for the somewhat less demanding horror-fan. If you have this feeling that genetically altered killer bats might amuse you, then ignore the low rating on here and just watch it.Now, can someone recommend me a better movie with a whole bunch of killer bats in it?",

If it had been made fifty years earlier I can definitely see Boris Karloff or Bela Lugosi in the part that Bob Gunton plays as the mad scientist.The scariest thing about Bats is not the creatures themselves although they are the ugliest looking things this side of the Black Scorpion. The scariest part of the film was Bob Gunton's portrayal of the mad scientist who created this race of killer omnivirous Bats. He's identified as working for the Center For Disease Control. I was watching this figuring out how this creep got government clearance.Yet Gunton is the most enjoyable thing in this film. And you got to love the fact that he had all these government facilities to work with, he's not hidden away in some laboratory in an old castle the way Karloff and Lugosi used to be. He's bred this race of flying fox bats from Indonesia which are aggressive to begin with and they've taken up residence in a bat cavern in Lou Diamond Phillips's county where he's the sheriff. After several suspicious deaths with mutilation, the cause is identified and zoologists Dina Meyer and Leon Robinson are brought in to clean out the bat cave. If you care about how and if they do it by all means watch the film and the hint is, think blob.Bats will never go down as a great science fiction classic, but it does have a certain campiness to it.

My expectations were realistic...meaning I didn't expect much, nor was I disappointed in my expectations.  This film is bad, yet in a way fairly entertaining.  Like many films of its ilk it is not trying to be taken too seriously.  We can tell this by the compact acting styles, the huge loopholes in plot, and the horrendous dialogue.  None of the actors are particularly good.  The CGI effects are dismal, and when the bats attack close-up one cannot see anything in the blurred action. Watching it I almost felt it looked a bit like Gremlins, only to be taken seriously and without the professionalism of all concerned in that film.

            "content": "\"Bats\" is not so much a 'bad' film; it's just very ordinary and d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu. This is your typical creature-feature about a genetically mutated animal-species (in this case: bats, duh!) that becomes a little TOO intelligent after the experiments performed on them and turns against the creators. And of course the two escaped lab-bats infect the normal ones and pretty soon an entire Texas town is overcome by millions of carnivorous bats! It's up to zoologist Dina Meyer, her dim assistant Leon and sheriff Lou Diamond Phillips to prevent that this plague spreads itself throughout the entire United States. This film has quite a few good aspects going for it, but also too many negative ones and the latter make this is a generally unmemorable and lacking horror film. The most important positive element about \"Bats\" is that the screenplay doesn't waste any time! There clearly is a bat-problem and all the characters immediately acknowledge this. Usually in this type of B-movies, it takes another boring hour or so before everyone accepts that harmless little animals can turn into bloodthirsty monsters. Unfortunately, this is where the praising stops\u0085After the no-nonsense opening sequences, the film turns into an endless series of dull clich\u00e9s, lousy dialogues, bad acting and terrible special effects. In fact, there are no special effects! The numerous bat-attacks exist of wide pan-shots of the sky but when the critters eventually descend to assault their preys, everything becomes all blurry and you can't possibly make out what's happening. It's hard to take the acting leads seriously (Dina Meyer as a Doctor??) and Leon's character is just a dreadful stereotype of the petrified and witty assistant who brings some comic relief.

            "content": "Hearing of a series of bat attacks, a scientist and her helper arrive in a small Texas town to deal with the creatures only to learn they're genetically modified killing machines and must find a way of dealing with the creatures once and for all before they escape.There are some pretty good points in this one. What's really enjoyable about this one a lot of great moments is the high-amount of action scenes within this one with a really fast and quite watchable pace to it. The opening attack, where the bats appear to attack the couple in the truck makes for a strong opening while a follow-up encounter where the bats swarm over a truck containing several characters when a second one comes up and they suddenly become aware of the new vehicle and come to an abrupt stop, then turn their heads towards the car so that their eyes light up a malevolent yellow which is one of the best shots. The main sequence in the middle of the movie where a large swarm of bats attacks the middle of town, causing general panic and mayhem also this helps out as the large amount of action including causing cars crashing into electrical poles, gets in tons of small individual encounters of the population getting swarmed allowing for a lot of great action and gore while the fact that it plays out over a long period of time is quite nice. As well, there's the later attack on the school as there's some solid swarming and ambushes there which makes for a fun time, and the finale in the tunnel makes for some atmospheric times with some rather frantic and enjoyable times trying to get out before they wake up which is what's quite thrilling about the sequence while providing a lot of fun action-packed moments here. It's also a little refreshing to see everybody agreeing that the problem is bats right from the start rather than having the clich\u00e9d extended argument among people who had clear evidence that it was bats and someone like the chief cop constantly butt heads over what the culprit is until it had a physical attack done in front of everyone to convince them is a nice change of pace. The last plus here is that the bats are actually pretty good, and they're really believable by abandoning the CGI commonly used for these types of films since the puppets look pretty realistic, and their close-ups make them out to be pretty terrifying to a degree. This is a lot better than it's been made out to be although it does have some problems. The biggest one here is that there are several confusing shots in this. Every time there was some sort of dramatic bat attack, the camera would go off on some sort of hyped-up whirlwind of herky-jerky motion that keeps it from being scary as the attack scenes become moot because we don't even get to see what's going on in the scene the cuts are so quick. The film provides in spades, since you often can't tell what is happening on screen and making the technique even more obnoxious is that it's used pretty much throughout the entire film. The origin of the bats is also a little confusing. All we know is that bats are attacking while how they're attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery. These bring the film down slightly from what it could've been.Rated PG-13: Violence, Adult Language and photographic violence of animals.",

I actually cared about what happened to these characters and I wanted them to Live. I found Leon funny and he gave good lines of dialogue and he was fun to watch. That's another thing that makes this film work,the cast was good. Lou diamond Phillips was also fun to watch and I found him to be a cool character and he played his role of the sheriff well. I also thought the acting from the three main people was Okay. I thought there were a lot of well done attack sequences especially the one at the start of the film which I thought was very bloody and brutal,I also thought the scene was shot well and the bats looked cool. There were some well shot scenes in the film one that I liked is when two of our main characters are trapped inside a car and a swarm of bats completely cover the car,they cover it so much you can barely see it anymore and I thought that was a bizarre but interesting scene. There were scenes where dozens of people were getting attacked in the street and there were bats flying around everywhere in and out of shops,people were getting attacked in restaurants and things were getting blown up and there was non stop Action. I'm surprised most people don't like this film because I thought it was Action packed!. I also liked how our main three characters worked together to try and stop the bats and they set traps for the bats. I especially liked the scene were Leon burns a bunch of bats with a flamethrower I thought that was a very Fun scene. That's why I'm giving praise to this film because it was low budget and they used the budget well and they were still able to create a lot of exciting action scenes and Fun moments. This has a lot of Action for a low budget film,and I found the story interesting. The film also has a very exciting and intense Finale that had me on the edge of my seat. This film was fun and fast paced and I recommend the film.",

            "content": "I think the Oscar race just got a little tighter when Bats was released into the market.  This is clearly one of the best films that has come out this year.  You can forget about the cynicism of American Beauty, the brilliance of Fight Club, the ingenuity of Three Kings and the mania that is Sixth Sense, Bats is set to go down as one of the greats up there with Jaws, Patton, Rocky, Annie Hall and Amadeus.  I think future generations of Hollywood directors and writers are going to turn to BATS to see how it is done.  John Carpenter's Halloween and Spielberg's Jaws used to be the bench mark when it came to horror, but this has put a whole new perspective into how to scare someone at the theater.  When I left the theater my knuckles were a ghostly white from gripping the arm rests and when I looked on the ghastly faces of the hundreds of people leaving the theater, they all had the same expression.  They were frightened.  The show ended at about midnight and we were all anxious to get into our cars because we were afraid those cunning bats were waiting to get us, right outside the theater.  Now that is good film making.  Jaws made me afraid of the ocean, I think Bats is going to make me afraid of the night sky.  I have never seen bats that look this real in a movie.  Those fangs were so real looking that most of the budget must have gone into the production of those intricately designed bats.  Fangs, eyes, and even their hissing sounds were realistic.  What a fantastic film.  If this isn't nominated at Oscar time for best picture and director, then I would say that something is up with the academy.  I am still in awe and utter fear as I sit here and write this review of Bats. This is one of the scariest films that I have ever seen. WOW!!!Okay, I just had to do it.  I had to.Bats is really one of the worst films to come out this year.  But this is a film that is so easy to rip on that I thought it would be fun to do the exact opposite and just confuse the hell out of the readers for a minute or so.  The only award this may be winning this year is the Raspberry awards. But you know what?  Going into this film, I was expecting a really, really, really bad film.  I only got a bad one, so that was unexpected and a nice surprise.  I think I, like most other horror movie nuts enjoy a good \"bad\" horror flick at times.  There is just something about cheese that is fun at times.  And for that reason, Bats delivers.  Everything you have heard about the film is true.  It is all bad.  The bats are laughable, the story is a joke and the writing is awful, even the commercials looked pretty bad.  But there is one good thing going for it, and that is that it had a subtle homage to Jaws in it.  The guy that first gets killed at the beginning is named \"Quint\" and when they do an autopsy on him, it wreaked of Hoopers little angry deposition in Jaws when he tells them that it wasn't a boating accident.  And if you can pick up on little subtleties like that then the film is more fun.  Really, this isn't all that bad, I mean it is bad, but there are really worse out there.  Have you ever seen Truth Or Dare?  I mean the movie where mental patients get a hold of a grenade and blow their own heads off?  Well that is really bad, I mean really, really bad.  And as I said, this is just bad.  But I saw it in an empty theater during the day. Seriously, there was just me and a friend.  And at AMC in Toronto, they have retractable arm rests so that you can put them back and use the seats as a couch, which is what we did.  It was very comfortable and we enjoyed the movie quite a bit more that way.  Bats will probably be gone by the time this review gets to IMDb so you may not have a chance to see it at the theater, but if you are in a campy horror movie mood, then rent this when it comes out on video.  You may enjoy it.  I hope you didn't take my accolades too seriously at the beginning of the film, it was all in good fun.  And remember, sometimes bad movies can be fun to see.  You don't have to think, you don't really have to feel either.  And you get to laugh at stupid people doing stupid things.  Bats is a great example of that.  If Bats is even ever mentioned in the same sentence as American Beauty come Oscar time, there will be a federal inquiry and Mr. Logan and the backers of this movie may go to a maximum state prison and his punishment would be to watch this movie every day of his sentence.  Now that would be funny.",

            "content": "After revisiting this 1990s update of the classic \"nature strikes back\" genre of the 1970s, this viewer can say that he has warmed up to it a bit. It's of absolutely no real distinction, but adequate directing and acceptable acting manage to overcome a VERY routine script. An unending multitude of killer bats (that have been genetically engineered, naturally) are unleashed on a sleepy Texas burg. Among our heroes are a laid back sheriff (Lou Diamond Phillips), a bat expert (Dina Meyer), and her assistant (Leon).The script by John Logan is stupid and clich\u00e9d, and unfortunately treats the assistant character as a comedy relief stereotype. It's also kind of hard to feel sorry for the many townspeople in the movies' big set piece when they prove too dumb to get the Hell out of Dodge. The execution does manage to make this reasonably entertaining, with a fair bit of intense action and some moderate suspense. The effects, unfortunately, are mostly pretty poor. The puppets are not the best work that KNB has ever done, and the digital FX are purely laughable. At the very least, there's some pleasing widescreen photography and scenic locations. Some horror fans may also be pleased with the fairly high body count.Phillips is likable in the hero role; he's at least more convincing here as a cop than he was in \"The First Power\". The real standout is the lovely Meyer: not only is she excellent eye candy, but her character is very smart, very strong, and very capable. Leon is wasted in his role. That brings us to the matter of Bob Gunton, a superb veteran character actor who has one of the most embarrassing roles of his career. Cast as the requisite mad scientist, you'll likely be left shaking your head at the flimsiness of his motivation.NOT an altogether bad movie, but also far from being a good one. Fortunately, it's relatively short.Five out of 10.",

            "content": "Bats starts late one night in 'Gallup, Texas' where a young couple Quint (Tim Whitaker) & Emma (Juliana Johnson) are waiting at a level crossing for a train to pass, however as they wait they are attacked by bats & killed. Cut to 'Skull Valley, Arizona' & Dr. Sheila Casper (Dina Meyer) is the foremost expert in her field, the field of bats. So it comes as no surprise that sinister Government black suit wearing official Dr. Tobe Hodge (Carlos Jacott) asks for her help & expertise. Together with her assistant Jimmy (Leon) Dr. Casper is flown to the small Texas town of Gallup where Sheriff Emmett Kimsey (Lou Diamond Phillips) is trying to work out what happened to Quint & Emma, step in Hodge & genetic scientist Dr. Alexander MaCabe (Bob Gunton) who explain that they have created a new sort of bat, they have taken an ordinary Flying Fox & genetically enhanced it so they are more intelligent, stronger, bigger, work together & are totally hostile to any other living creature, oh & they also carry a viral disease which would infect other bats & turn them into vicious killing machines too. Even though they don't like it Dr. Casper & Sheriff Kinsey decide to help in order to save the town, however it soon become apparent that it won't be as easy as they first thought & it's not long before the entire town of Gallup is under attack from the winged killers...Directed by Louis Morneau I thought Bats was an OK film in a brain-dead rubbishy sort of way, it isn't going to win any awards but for what it was I quite liked it (emphasis on the word 'quite'). The script by John Logan moves along at a nice pace & is never really boring or overly dull but is stuffed with loads of horror film clich\u00e9s, the stuffy female scientist who starts to loosen up & become romantically involved with the brave hero, the annoying obligatory black comic relief character, the evil scientist who cares for nothing but his experiments & is finally killed by them, the shady Government figure, the heavy-handed military who are all gung-ho & cause almost as many problem's as the bats themselves, the disbelieving (at first) local townspeople & the isolated location. It's all here folks but it's done in a reasonably entertaining way that passes an hour and a half painlessly enough I suppose. The film lacks any real violence or gore, apart from an autopsy scene at the start Bats doesn't have enough of the red stuff. The climax where a swarm of bats are chasing our heroes through some mine shafts is fairly decent & manages to create some excitement although I'm not sure two human beings could outrun 1000's of genetically enhanced (bigger, better & badder than your average bat) bats in a straight race...Director Morneau keeps things moving along, doesn't spend too much time on silly unnecessary character development & doesn't seem to take it all too seriously. However the bat attacks are annoyingly edited, loads of ultra quick cuts, so much so that it becomes confusing as to whats happening. Don't expect to see much during these scenes as it really does become a bit of a blur, maybe they are presented this way to hide the special effects up? The bats themselves look pretty cool although it's obvious their puppets.With a supposed budget of about $6,500,000 Bats looks OK & is generally well made but that sounds like a lot of money considering what ended up on screen. The photography, music & production values are good if not spectacular while the special effects alternate between CGI & rubber puppets, both of which have their fair share of effects that work & effects that don't. The acting was OK but no one stands out except the token black comedy relief guy Leon who becomes highly irritating.Bats isn't the best horror film ever made that's for sure, but it's far from the worst either. On a dumb predictable sort of level I thought it was watchable, worth a watch for horror fans but others may find it all rather silly & stupid.",

            "content": "Twenty years after Hollywood made NIGHTWING they decided to tackle the subject of killer bats once again with results that turn out to be less than inspired.It's not that BATS is a particularly bad film; it isn't. It ticks all of the boxes and runs through the scenarios with a modicum of energy and drive. The problem is, as with most Hollywood films made recently, a series lack of originality or indeed intelligence. BATS turns out to be cheesy and predictable in equal measures, delivering up its threat of genetically-modified bats without much in the way of passion or intrigue.The plot follows the likes of THE BIRDS and other classics fairly closely. Moments between the set-pieces are dull, while the bat attacks are spoiled by some average CGI effects work (Hitchcock's superimposed birds are still superior to the creatures here). In close up, the rubbery menaces are about as realistic as the bats in Hammer's SCARS OF Dracula; not Greg Nicotero's finest moment, that's for sure.Cast-wise, it's pretty lacklustre. Lou Diamond Phillips goes through the motions and STARSHIP TROOPERS' Dina Meyer displays a singular lack of presence. Leon's character reveals everything that's wrong with Hollywood's reliance on the clich\u00e9d \"funny black guy\" in otherwise straight films. All in all a largely forgettable movie that disappeared as quickly as it arrived; go back to Hitchcock for a decent winged-menace movie.",

            "content": "Horror is a very poorly regarded genre and you'll notice that the IMDb top 250 movies has a lack of horror movies in the list . Hardly surprising since much of these plots revolve around characters doing stupid things . As soon as someone says \" Don't go into the woods at night \" you know fine well what will happen . It's always puzzled me why the heroes go to Castle Dracula at midnight to kill the vampire when their task would have been much simpler if they'd waited till day break . BATS continues this type of trend but what makes it worse is the way it treats its audience like total idiots Take the heroine Dr Sheila Caspar whose employed by a government agency because she's the world's most renowned expert on bats . The thing is that she can't be a day over 25 ! How long did she spend at university studying bats ? Two minutes ? It's a sad day indeed when the world's most renowned expert on anything looks barely old enough to frequent a bar . I suppose this is possibly forgivable since the producers thought no one over 18 would watch this ( They might actually be correct ) so decided to make the heroine sexy What isn't forgivable is that BATS lacks any type of internal continuity or logic . In fact it's downright offensive on this score . The bats ( Which have to be seen to be believed ) attack a small town . What would you do if a swarm of bats attacked your town ? Would you lock yourself in a cupboard ? I know I would but for some incomprehensible reason people walking down a street don't seem to notice them until it's their turn to be attacked and despite people screaming and crashing their trucks which then explode people drinking in a bar don't seem to notice the chaos for a full five minutes . It also goes without saying that when one of the heroes is attacked they can literally fight off dozens of the critters but one bite from a single bat is enough to kill a nameless extra . If this was a STAR TREK episode most people would be wearing a red top I notice that during the attack on the town the local cinema is showing NOSFERATU which seems to indicate a post modernist sophistication on the part of the makers but again would a small American town be showing legendary silent movies at the local cinema ? Highly unlikely and everything else in this movie indicates that the producers thought the target audience were complete and total idiots",

No, this movie is called \"Bats\", and right after the opening five minutes all the central characters know they're dealing with bats and already make their first plans against them.

Bob Gunton plays the semi-mad scientists who created the genetically-engineered diabolical creatures.This is a solid creatures-on-the-loose movie with a quality cast and a lot of thrills, but it never rises above run-of-the-mill for a few reasons: For one, there's no interesting subtext. This is a film about mutated bats threatening a town and the people who try to vanquish them; that's it. While there's nothing wrong with such an approach, it can only be successful IF the creatures are interesting enough, like 1972's excellent \"Gargoyles,\" but I personally don't find bats that interesting. Don't get me wrong, the filmmakers did their best to make the creatures as malevolent, hideous and formidable as possible, but they're still bats. Another negative is that there's no female eye candy beyond the alluring main protagonist, Dina Meyer, and they don't do anything with her besides showcasing her stunning face. I'm not suggesting nudity or anything pornographic here -- not at all -- but professional filmmakers are able to take advantage of the female resources at their disposal and this film doesn't do that.\"Bats\" strikes me as a decent TV creature feature -- decent, not great or even really good -- and I find it hard to believe that it was a theatrical release.The film runs 91 minutes and was shot in Utah.GRADE: C+",

The acting is surprisingly competent, which is credit to the actors who do a good job with the material provided.Bats isn't a bad film, it's just nothing particularly out of the ordinary. It's full of clich\u00e9s and the bats have this strange habit of letting major characters get a good head start before trying to eat them (as opposed to the meaningless stream of extras who get munched straight away).If you can really be bothered to watch another 'monster-munching' movie, then you could do worse. It's just you could also do a hell of a lot better.",

This soon becomes irritating.Unfortunately, mediocrity permeates every aspect of this film. The acting isn't great, but it's not awful. The same goes for the script. As a result, it doesn't even descend into the so-bad-it's-good category (although there are one or two laughably bad moments).

            "content": "* 1/2 out of ****Prior to Bats, I'd never seen a horror film centered around the winged rodents before, so it's easy to be curious and skeptical about this film. But just as the previews proved, this is a pretty bad movie, not quite as terrible as I'd expected, but still quite the lackluster picture.  The story is typical for any killer animal movie, meaning we get a few specialists (led by Dina Meyer) and the town sheriff (Lou Diamond Phillips) out to stop the mutated bats before they spread their chaos over the entire continent.Easily Bats' weakest aspect is the dialogue and Leon's performance.  Hell, the two even go hand-in-hand as it's Leon delivering most of the pathetic one-liners.  Every time the guy opens his mouth, it's all it takes to keep from covering my ears, that's how embarrassing his stereotypical black man role is.  Bob Gunton is almost as annoying as the mad scientist who caused the whole mess, playing the same role he always does in the same manner. Phillips is usually a fine actor, but he should stray from attempting a southern drawl.  Dina Meyer is both talented and pretty, and fares the best here as the chiroptologist and heroine.Director Louis Morneau has all of one good film under his belt (the underrated sci-fi/action thriller Retroactive), and a whole lotta crap beside it.  Bats is an improvement over, say, Carnosaur 2, but it simply doesn't gel as the fun thriller it aspires to be.  Aside from the small town massacre (an admittedly fun setpiece, the only thing keeping this above * star), the rest of the film lacks thrills, suspense, and a good sense of humor.  While the movie does have a very slick, polished look, most of the visual effects are cheesy and the individual bat attacks are made into big blurs with Morneau's quick-cut editing and shaky camerawork.  Hard to believe this is the same man who gave us all that thrilling action in Retroactive.Bats concludes with the expected prolonged segment of our heroes entering the creatures' lair.  But Aliens, this is not.  The climax is just one long drag that ends in a predictable fashion.  But the final scene, which breaks a standard horror movie cliche, delivers a good belly laugh that made me wonder why the whole film wasn't packed with this kind of humor.",

Scary in parts and witty dialogue. The lead characters were all likable (bad guys excepted of course). This is a fairly routine creature feature in some respects, but more believable than most in as much as the characters are neither stupidly heroic nor embarrassingly cowardly, the response to the emergency by the public and the authorities is also quite realistic. The sudden appearance of such numbers of bats is a bit of a stretch and some of the claims made by Dr McCabe are a touch too much, but other than that and the ultimate cause of the bat problem everything else works OK, for me at least.

            "content": "\"Bats\" amounts to a load of guano. This mediocre animals-run-amok thriller raises little hair either as a horror chiller or as a creature feature. The executives at Destination Films who green-lighted this half-baked hokum as their debut offering on the Hollywood scene should be hanged by their heels! Director Lou (\"Made Men\" & \"Carnosaur 2\") Morneau and an overqualified cast struggle valiantly against predictable writing and ersatz special effects. \"Bats\" teams up a rugged, cigar-chomping Texas sheriff (Lou Diamond Phillips of \"Young Guns\") with a drop-dead gorgeous bat expert (Dina Meyers of \"Starship Troopers\") as they battle two scientifically beefed-up bats that threaten to destroy life as we know it on the North American continent. Scenarist John Logan has cobbled together a thoroughly synthetic script based on classics ranging from Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Birds\" to Steven Spielberg's \"Jaws\" and \"Jurassic Park.\" Logan substitutes genetically enhanced bats for dinosaurs, but (trust me) their lack of size does matter.You've seen it done before and done better. The action unfolds one dark night in Gallup, Texas (pop. 7,000), when two carnivorous bats kill a couple of teenagers. Clearly, \"Bats\" imitates the opening scene from \"Jaws.\" Cut to a helicopter from the Centers for Disease Control whirling into a remote desert location to haul Dr. Sheila Casper (Dina Meyers of \"Starship Troopers\"), a zoologist specializing in bats, and her wise-cracking assistant, Jimmy Sands (Leon), to Gallup for an autopsy. The pick-up scene comes from \"Jurassic Park\" while the autopsy is straight out of \"Silence of the Lambs.\" Although \"Bats\" adheres to a sure-fire horror film formula, this movie delivers few thrills and chills.CDC chief Dr. Hodge (Carlos Jacott) introduces them to the amoral scientist, Dr. McCabe (Bob Gunton of \"Patch Adams\"), who created this mutant strain of killer bats. According to McCabe, he has spent vast sums of government funds over the last decade breeding these biologically altered bats. Experimenting on Flying Foxes, an Indonesian bat with a six-foot wingspan, he has made them smarter and more aggressive. Further, he has turned them into the equivalent of winged piranha. They fly in swarms and feast on flesh. When Jimmy asks why, McCabe boasts: \"That's what scientists do. Improve things.\" Gee, sounds a lot like the unscrupulous scientists from \"Jurassic Park.\" Sheriff Emmett Kimsey (Phillips) shepherds Casper & the CDC people on their search for the bats. The dialogue about these ferocious flying mammals is unintentionally hilarious. \"Are we talking about bats!?\" Nevertheless, the filmmakers go to silly extremes to persuade us that these crafty critters pose a peril. At one point, they trap Kimsey and Casper in his police pick-up and try to burrow through the AC to feed on them. Eventually, the bats decimate the townspeople of Gallup, and the U.S. Army rolls in for the big showdown. Our heroes track the bats down to an abandoned mine, and the military unveils a giant refrigeration bomb (looking something like a chrome-plated colander) to freeze the fiends. Freezing is another of those time-honored techniques for destroying certain monsters.But these villainous varmints come out swinging. They wipe out the troops before they can set off the bomb. The Army retreats and calls in the U.S.A.F. to finish the job. Casper warns them that blowing up the bats will create bigger headaches. Reluctantly, the military permits Kimsey and Casper to reenter the cave and detonate the bomb. In a suspenseful finale, reminiscent of Michael Bay's \"The Rock,\" Casper and Kimsey plunge into the cave, wade through a river of guano, and work against the clock to freeze their foe before the Air Force blasts the mountain to smithereens. Shoddy special effects defang the fright. When the bats fly, they appear as computer generated graphics, but you can barely distinguish one bat from another, so they look like confetti. When the attack their victims, they show up as obvious hand puppets. Worse, the seams between the computer graphics and the puppets are blatantly obvious. As a result, the bats attain little screen menace. They resemble \"Ghoulies\" with wings. Consequently, \"Bats\" drums up very little terror because the titular antagonists never chill your goose bumps. The only thing compelling about \"Bats\" is director Louis Morneau's muscular direction. He pours on non-stop action, rarely letting anything interfere with the forward momentum of the plot, but his roller coaster tactics cannot disguise the substandard special effects or distract us from the corny dialogue.As ecological catastrophe chillers go, \"Bats\" is a trick on movie audiences rather than a treat for them.",

Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a fairly typical \"nature gone wild\" film which suffered somewhat from its lack of horror and suspense.

That's new!). The scientists, one a woman (Dina Meyer) who wants to make up for her errors and a man (Bob Gunton) who wants them back for his own errors. They all are under the shadow of the lead hero, a sheriff played by Lou Diamond Phillips, struggling against CGI and puppet Bats, the real stars of the film, just as bad as the human characters, but at least they don't talk and don't get to have a line in the tailor-made-to-be-Ed Wood's-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 screenplay.That's just about what I remember from BATS, other than the fact that it's a 'Movie-of-the-week' thriller that lost its hands to a big-screen production. It may just be a sincere bad movie, but even if it is, it still ain't any good.

The first problem is that unless we are dealing with vampire bats then the title fails to give off any form of scary intimidation as say Anaconda where the thought of the animal is far more intimidating. Then we have a host of airheads that do nothing to render this scary. There is a meathead scientist who experiments with nature by creating a nasty breed of bat thus letting them loose to attack everything that moves. A bat expert is summoned to assist the local Sheriff. This leads to a rather cruel and disgusting climax. Director Louis Morneau does his best but the scientist featured here is a real joke. Bob Gunton plays the biggest idiot in the history of horror films. He out stretches his arms claiming to control the critters only to be slaughtered by a flock of them. Was he drunk or just on a serious amount of cocaine?

            "content": "This movie is pretty awful. The actors try, but they are so hampered by terrible dialogue, a truly dire script and goofy effects, that the whole thing comes over as pure MST3K fodder.The effects are sub-standard. Oh, the CGI \"in the distance\" bats are fine, if a little obviously CGI. But it's the close-up, rubber bats that really let the side down. The closer the shot of the bat, the more rubbery and less realistic it looks. As an idea, if you've ever seen the film \"Ghoulies\", then you might have some idea of how un-lifelike and rubbery they look.My favourite bat moment, though, was the bat-cam. Here, they stuck a rubber bat to the front of the camera and run around with it, to show you what an attack looks like from a bat's eye view, as it were. But it's so ludicrous I was laughing my head off.But it's not just the effects that are lame. The plot is too. On the whole, its bearable. But right at the end, it falls flat on its face with the most awful and glaringly obvious screw up on the part of the scriptwriters/cutting crew et al.The script is so full of cliche horror moments its unreal. Top of the list are the beautiful heroine and comedy side-kick. Also present is the evil scientist out to protect his creations, which ultimately turn on him. Ho hum. We also have the disbelieving populace (until its too late!). The hard-nosed \"kill 'em all\" military man. The list just goes on and on.Among the many stupidities that the cast are called upon to perform in the name of the script is the holing up in the town school so that they can track the bats by satellite. Apparently, they couldn't do this from a safe location, far from the bats, as this wouldn't have meant an attack by the bats for dramatic effect. As a further idiocy, the back-up generator is installed far from the \"control room\", allowing for a panicked run to start it up when the bats short out the power. Furthermore, its a pullcord starter, so that the heroes have trouble getting it going, to further enhance the already non-existent tension.But the best bit is saved for last.You see, spoilers, they find the bats are holed up in an abandoned mine (now isn't that original). The military sends a team up there and lowers a truck-sized refrigeration unit into the mine on a long cable. The idea is to chill the bats and make them go ni-nights. However, the bats return (did I mention the soldiers do this at night?) and slaughter the lot of them. Enter our heroes, who turn up next day to finish the job. Except......they go into the mine through some convoluted passageways and an elevator barely big enough for the two of them. At this point, not having seen the military actually lowering the freezer into the mine, I was wondering how they got something that size down all these twisty passages, especially since we'd been told (several times) that there was only one entrance to the mine. Anyhow, after some time our heroes enter the bat cavern and, guess what? There's the freezer unit, dangling from a big hole in the roof on the end of a cable. At this point I was scowling at the stupidity of it all. Why didn't our heroes merely go down through the roof where the freezer was? Of course, the answer was that the scriptwriters are stupid, stupid people who believe we won't notice such an awful screw-up. To add insult to injury, after escaping from the bat lair, our heroes blow the entrance to seal the mine and the bats inside. Except, considering there was only one entrance, the explosion covers the whole darn hillside.Oh, and by the way, Mr writer, if you're going to write a story about bats, it might help to actually get a bat expert to tell you some basic facts about them. Like for instance, how bat guano contains a great deal of nitrates and ammonia and is quite flammable. So I don't think a bat expert would be igniting a frickin' flare in the bat cave!One final rant. If they were going to seal the bats in the cave, what was the point of the freezer? It'll run out of fuel eventually, then the bats'll wake up. So what was the point? Maybe I dozed off and missed something.Anyway, a really crap film that doesn't deserve to have Dina Meyer or Lou Diamond Phillips in it. What were those two thinking? This'll harm their careers for sure.If you must watch it, look out also for the CDC guy's mullet (hairstyle). It's one of the worst I've seen for a while and worth laughing at every time he appears. Other than that, though, this is a real turkey and best avoided except as a DIY MST3K with your mates and plenty of beer.",

The lack of script and direction dramatically adds to the aforementioned unimaginative schema, creating a meretricious masterpiece equally appreciated by both the comatose and fatuous. This inanimate roller coaster of a movie has little action or suspense. Sadly these qualities are devoured by the grating ennui. If one enjoys reasons to take naps, 'Bats' is for you.

She reminded me of a young Erika Eliniak, but in a more natural, non-enhanced sense if you know what I mean. Looking at her biography on IMDb.Com, she is indeed very talented and very smart. Lou Diamond Phillips and Bob Gunton brought a sense of dignity to the mostly improbable script. Also, Lou looked believable in his sheriff outfit. The whole thing reminded me a lot of The Birds, but not as scary. Also, in reply to another posting from SAMLCITR, I never did see the air conditioning unit being shut off after the blasts. Seeing this movie reminded me of a section in Candace Bergen's autobiography. She was on location for \"Bite The Bullet\" and was horrified at the (in her opinion) lousy script. She was complaining about it loud and long it to everyone in earshot. Gene Hackman turned to her and said, \"you take a bad script and you work with it. That's what acting is about.\" (or something to that effect).",

The king movies of creature films. And, sadly BATS tried to be just like them. The cast is a bunch of extras that couldn't land themselves parts in bigger movies by having sex with the directors like how their best friend's probably told them. The script is poorly written with bad dialogue (it is written by John Logan, the guy who wrote the remake script for THE TIME MACHINE). The film is just loaded with stupid attempts at heroic efforts but the film fails except in the very begin sequence where two kids \"meet\" the bats who have been genetically altered (typical B-movie plot) by a \"mad\" scientist (Bob Gunton). The film is not all bad. But is not all good either. It is just another movie to take off the shelf every so often when you are in the middle of a hangover.

The closeups are frequent and always disturbing. The sound effects and cinematography are great, and fun, but my main complaint is the \"chaotic camera work\" during attack scenes; effective in short bursts, but sometimes they go on way too long. Aside from that it's a short movie, to the point, and highly enjoyable if you know what you're getting into. Dina Meyer and Lou Diamond Phillips make it even more entertaining.",

Their gambit paid off, and now there's a whole new generation of people who associate Lou Diamond Phillips with bad movies.Is this is a good movie? No. Should that stop you from watching it? Definitely not. Why limit yourself to that which is objectively good? If you can't sit down and enjoy a bad movie about bats attacking people, you're taking life too seriously.

I was in a local theatre with a sound system that had never impressed me in the past, but during this film i swore the bats were hovering and then streaking across the ceiling - it was unbelievable! - you don't really see bats that frequently anyway or maybe you think you do because when you see them you remember them, but the darkness of the theatre combined with what you know about bats makes you feel like you're being preyed upon or like you are in a cave and that the bats are all around you..

It really gave nothing too special other than a few moments. Those moments which work are the scenes in the small town when the bats attack the townsfolk. We get nice location shots of them attacking a bar, a grocery store, the outside of a movie theatre, etc. That was really well done. Where the movie fails is it's ending portion. It drags on way too much in which the experts and Sheriff Emmett Kimsey tries to kill them.

They are picked up by some doctors who claim of a biological emergency involving bats that they can help with after finding the dead couple in the car. Along for the ride is Sheriff Emmett Kimsey who clearly has chemistry with Sheila. The large killer bats are apparently from Indonesia and are an endangered species which Dr. McCabe has been experimenting on in an attempt to find a cure for unnamed viruses. The Indonesian bats are infected (thanks to Dr. McCabe) and when they escaped capture, they've since infected regular bats in the area. As they quickly make their way to the small Texan town of Gallup, it'll be up to Emmett, Sheila and Jimmy to fight against their attacks before the entire state is taken over and killed.This has to have been the third time I've seen Bats over the years and each time I start it I think to myself that it can't be as bad as I remember it being. No way is it as weak as critics say. Well, it is and it isn't. Bats is in no way a great horror or sci-fi flick. There is some bad dialogue, very little tension throughout, and with a weak ending. However, watching it today, I did think that it showed some promise and had a bit of heart. The best part of the movie is obviously when the Bats attack the small town in Texas, chasing all of the townsfolk on the street killing quite a few of them. The live and puppet bats look pretty good too, very effective.The acting is fine, nothing to write home about. Lou Diamond Phillips and Dina Meyer are the leads as the Sheriff and Bat Zoologist. They do an alright job and do have chemistry which is needed. Leon is there only to be the comic relief (sadly), but he does a wonderful job given the material. Bob Gunton plays the evil maniacal scientist/doctor who has caused this outbreak of killer bats and he plays it pretty well also.Overall, Bats is an average monster/killer animal horror movie. It's not as bad as I remembered it being, and I think is worthy of at least one watch. I give it a lot of credit for being on such a low budget and managing to stage that bat attack scene on the streets of Gallup. Very effective moment, but unfortunately it's followed up with a weaker finish.5/10",

They have turned a really BAD film into a bad film, something most film editors don't have the power to successfully accomplish. In most movies we never think about the editing, instead dwelling on more obvious elements such as the writing or acting, but here it is actually remarkable. They didn't concentrate on the actors, who were unimaginably weak, instead on some nice moon and bat shots. The sound editing also deserves points for making it as if the bats are along with you.\tThat said, the rest of the movie is a horrible mess. Lou Diamond Phillips keeps getting role after role even though he couldn't act to save his life. There are a lot of non-acting actors out there, but normally they are known for doing something else well, such as singing (Mick Jagger, Jon Bon Jovi) or modeling (Cameron Diaz). Phillips, on the other hand, doesn't do anything else. His job consists of sleeping in a big trailer, being dragged out to recite his lines, and walking back to the trailer.\tFor whatever reason 'Bats' was a modest hit, it must have been the odd (very odd) favorable review or the flashy previews",

The bat on a pole chasing them down a corridor is great but it's not just the shoddy special effects that amuse you because the scriptwriter clearly knows nothing at all about bats and wasn't prepared to skim a book about them before writing this rubbish. I especially liked the bat experts outrage that the scientist had engineered bats to eat meat as though we were talking about cows or something. Most bats are predators, I don't know what the film makers think insects are made out of, flying cheese sauce or something I suppose.The bat-vision scenes are dreadful, if you've made a substandard film the last thing you want to do is annoy the audience even more with ridiculous warped views that don't tie in with what's happening on screen.None of the characters are credible, there's no tension and the bat attacks themselves are unintentionally funny.

            "content": "\"Bats\" is something of a schitzophrenic movie.  The last 30 minutes are very exciting and somewhat nerve wracking.  Unfortuatly, there's a whole hour before that, and thats not very good.  The premise is this: the US Government commissions research into biological weapons reasearch using bats.  One of the scientists involved in the project apparently loses touch with reality and lets his creation loose on the small town of Gallup, Texas.  Dina Meyer gives a solid performance, but seems to take this movie a bit too seriously.  She is however, as believeable as she is beautiful. \nLou Diamond Phillips makes his big screen return in this movie, and is almost laughably bad.  His character has an on/off accent, and when you first see him he is such a stereotype its hysterical.The bats are not too bad when viewed close up, but when you see the giant swarms of them they are clearly CGI, and move as such on screen.One thing I still have a hard time getting past was a couple rather glaring errors in the movie, and these could be considered spoilers.  Number 1...when the bats are attacking the schoolhouse, Dr. Casper (Dina Meyer) has the scientists gun...and she fires it at the attacking bats....you see her \"dry fire\" the gun when she runs out of ammo.  But automatic pistols lock the slide back when the magazine is empty.  The other very glaring error was the fact that this movie is set in Texas, and the US Air Force is going to bomb the mine where the bats have made their lair.  The planes have French Air Force markings.\"Bats\" was a movie with a good but unoriginal idea, and had potential.  Poor directing and bad execution made this movie a real loser.  If the entire thing had the intensity of the last half hour, it would have really been special.1 out of 5",

This is, by far, the worst performance of his career.  I can't believe he even agreed to this ridiculous bigotry-stereotyped role.  I expected much better of him.Overall, the film was not terrible.  It wasn't good either.  But it is good enough to sit through without changing the channel (I wouldn't pay to see it).  The acting actually wasn't that bad, and the writing was decent.  The special effects were horrible though.  The F/X guys couldn't seem to decide on exactly how big the bats were supposed to be.  In the beginning, they appeared to be about the size of normal bats with a 12\" wingspan.  But in some of the 1-on-1 attacks on people (this was the worst part of the movie), they appeared to be 40+ lb monsters with 4-ft wingspans!  And the close-up shots of the bats were so dumb.  They didn't look like bats at all.  They looked like plastic toys with moving gears.Another bad part of the movie was the jumping around of the camera.  During the most intense scenes, the camera jumped from scene-to-scene so fast, you couldn't make out exactly what they were supposed to be showing.  Calm it down on the camera jumps fellas.  Quick jumps don't add to the intensity; they just make you dizzy.  This was definitely the dizziest I'd been since forcing myself to sit through an entire showing of Blair Witch without vomiting.I still don't understand why directors feel the need to personify deadly creatures in horror movies today.  The stupid head and eye movements and cunning (crawling up your back) of the bats was simply unbelievable.  This reminded me a lot of the worst creature-horror movie, Anaconda.  If you thought the bats looked too silly to be real, you'll get a real kick out of that stupid snake.  Anaconda was more like a cartoon than a motion picture. And somebody PAID to see that garbage?I give it 3/10 and it's just good enough to watch on cable on a night that you had no plans.

Let's analyze the editorial brilliance. In the second scene, Meyer and Leon, some creepy dude, are examining harmless bats. A helicopter sneakily comes up on them and makes them jump (DEN DUN!) which adds to the sheer horror of the scene. You see them argue and moan before they get into the helicopter, and in the next scene they're leaving in a plane. What is this? The helicopter have Firestone tires or something? The cinematography is more erratic than Kaminski's brilliant \"Saving Private Ryan\", or something through the eyes of Ray Charles. Oh one more thing before I leave.

            "content": "\"Bats\" is, first and foremost, a comedy. Too bad it's not supposed to be one. The laughs come fast and furious right from the start when (you guessed it!) two teens in a deserted area of a small town  get ripped to shreds by marauding bats in a scene shot, like all the attacks in this movie, shakily, as if by someone holding a camera during an epileptic fit, which only serves to make obvious what the makers already know: these vicious monsters are about as terrifying as Big Bird and just as realistic. (They kind of look like a discarded design for Yoda.) Watch for the moment when one the leads picks up one of them: try not to laugh when it's crystal clear its wings are made out of cloth and that the actor is jiggling it about in an effort to give it the appearance of something other than a rubber toy! You'll also delight in watching the talented and handsome Lou Diamond Phillips (sporting a cigar and wavering 'Southern' accent) continue his descent into the movie trashcan, though he at least knows this is a lost cause, something which cannot be said for the deadly-serious Dina Meyer (whose character, a scientist, is -- you guessed it! -- \"the best in her field\") who performs as if this is some sort of Shakesperean drama and proves her home really was \"Beverly Hills 90210\", in which she had a brief role; she's not entirely unappealing but someone should have taken her aside and told her to relax and have some fun. That same someone should also have taken the time to have a little chit-chat with co-star Leon, who can give, and has given, good, solid turns, but here performs his role as written: Steppin Fetchit. It's an embarassment bordering on offensive. Other than this, just sit back and be entertained by every horror movie cliche trotted out gleefully and constantly.",

P. is a decent actor but is prone to overacting and in this one he REALLY does.  He's good in roles that call for that but in this one he was passable in the first half but it wasn't until the 2nd half to last 1/3 that his overacting was offset by the action of the film.  The acting overall left somewhat to be desired and the film was rather boring during the first half.  During the 2nd half it finally began to wake up and come to life and about the last 1/3 was actually enjoyable.  It didn't have enough of a budget to do it up right. Mind you, I realize that having a big budget and lots of flashy well done effects don't guarantee a good film or a hit but it certainaly helps when the movie is an effects type of movie as this.  Again they're a new company and don't appear to have the backing of a major studio so it can be forgiven as growing pains.  On the other hand because of the low budget (12 mil) they're likely to do well enough to make a profit and maybe to more with future pictures.  The movie is ok to see but I'd make sure it is either a matinee or even wait until video.  It's just not worth the full price.  But if you go see it, don't walk out.

Just from the name of the movie, I wasn't expecting much, and I wasn't overly disappointed because of this.The basic plot is this... A mad scientist (played by Gunton) invents a new breed of bats that the US military hopes to use as a super-weapon. Unfortunately for a small Texas town and its sheriff (Lou Diamond Phillips), the scientist lets the bats loose. They soon start killing animals, and then people, causing havoc in the town. A doctor (Dina Meyer) and her assistant join the party (Leon Robinson) to try to destroy the homicidal bats.The acting throughout this film is bad, but not as bad as other films (even some with larger budgets). Special effects in this film are average, but could've been a lot better for a theatre release. The plot is thin and flimsy and has a lot of wholes in it. And the dialog is unrealistic and cheezy... not much thought seemed to go into the script.This is the type of movie that would've fit in better as a TV-movie or a direct-to-video release. I'm surprised they bothered releasing this to movie theatres.If I had spent the $7 - $10 to see this movie when it first came out, I would've felt cheated. If I had spent the $3 - $5 to rent this movie, I would've been disappointed. But, I didn't spend any money to see this and I didn't expect much to begin with. If you are into the sort of movie that seems so bad it's funny, it might be worth it to you to rent this movie or to see it more than once on TV. Anyone else, if you are bored and have nothing better to do, this is a good time waster and it will keep you entertained. But after you see it, I doubt you'll want to see it again.Rating: 5/10",

It looks like a real movie, but it has all the best hallmarks of those endearing crappy B-films from the 1950s and 60s.  These include: horribly fake-looking monsters, laughably bad dialogue, a ridiculous script, and one-dimensional cliches for characters. Funny mainly because it seems to take itself seriously (unlike, say, \"Eight Legged Freaks), the movie's hilarity stops only when the black actor delivers yet another embarrassingly unfunny \"Negro comic relief\" line.Not the best \"good-bad\" movie ever, but still recommended for folks who like crappy movies that are unintentionally amusing and thought (like I did) that Hollywood couldn't make them anymore.",

I have sat through \"Challenge of the Super Friends: Attack of the Legion of Doom\" and found it downright funny.Bats, while not the worst movie I've ever seen (I reserve this title for Mission to Mars and Phantom Menace), is still pretty bad. But at least it is funny.  I honestly believe that the people who released this movie KNEW it was bad, but decided to release it anyway.  They were being \"scientists\" and attempting to see how well this stinker could do.  Who will pay $13.50 to see this movie? Will they ask for their money back? Who will LIKE it? How can we clone them?That aside, Bats should be played in Film classes. Not for its merits, but as an example of what NOT do do, especially when it comes to the camera work.  In TV they use a technique called a one shot, one shot, two shot (I may be a little off on the title here. I don't work in TV). Anywho, this is basically a description of how to film a conversation. Film one person's face, then the other person's face, then them talking together. Its a formula. Its an EASY formula. The director of Bats thought, \"hey! I can use that!\" And he does...for a conversation of 6+ people. It is the most disorienting thing I have ever watched. There is all of this quick cutting around the circle of people in an attempt to give them all their screen time. And just when I started to feel like I was going to yak, they did what should have been done in the first place: film all of them standing and talking together (the \"two shot\") in a semi-circle that is diguised to not look like a semi-circle (Hollywood does this so well). Why didn't they just do this in the first place? Were all of the actors clamering to get their close ups?  We may never know. What we do know is that that technique should never be employed for conversations greater that 2 maybe 3 people and each person should have a few lines before the camera is cut away, not just \"No\".There next filming mistake was the attack scenes that go on for a few minutes, but you still never know what is happening, or what happened until you see the corpses. Again to much fast cutting, and now blurry images as well.Now to step away from the camera stuff, we will examine the Bats themselves. I'm sorry, did you say Kermit was your father? I am a fan of muppets.  I liked Yoda as a muppet and was royally p***ed off when Lucas CGI'd him. But I like good muppets and only in their place. In sci-fi you can handle them, but in a killer animal movie?  The killer animals need to look REAL in order to \"scare\" us (the quotes here are being used sarcasticly). They should not look like something the director picked up at Toys R Us.The last major problem I found was with our so-called heroes.  Man do I hate idiot movies.  You know where the plot is only furthered because the characters are complete morons? I mean this chick is supposed to be a scientist! An EXPERT in Bats.  Shouldn't she KNOW how to get rid of them or catch them? Plus given the choice between having killer bats take over the whole continent or nuking the crap out of this small town so that they're gone forever, well just help me down with this missile. Oh, but we can't use nukes, they say. I'll destroy our quaint little town and our way of life. Ummm...so will the bats. The bats will also destroy all of the people on the rest of the continent except possibly the people in the Yukon. Stupid, stupid heroes.But all of that said, I did actually like watching Bats cause it gave me something to laugh at and then rant about, which is always fun.  I didn't go into the crappy dialouge cause after Attack of the Clones bad dialouge has a new high water mark.  Dialouge would need to be something SPECIAL to beat that putrid mess, and Bats, while bad, does not even come close.",

In one scene, the bat expert Jimmy, says to the scientist, \"If one of those bats toutches me, if it moves his head around (while saying this he rolls his head on his shoulders) and even seems like it's going to LOOK at me, I'm comin' after you!\"  When Jimmy is desribing the bats head movement, it seems almost like he is making fun of the way the puppet bats move around.  The bats also vary in size from a regular sized bat to a large bat with a wingspan of about 4 feet!  The people in this movie are idiots!  An officer is cornered by a group of bats in a diner, and all he has to say, with gun pointed at them is, \"Stay back, don't move!\"  In another diner a customer is getting mauled by a large bat, but the little kid near him doesn't notice because he's too involved in an arcade game.  I could go on more about that, but I won't.  The scientist character is a poor weak character (not really the actor's fault, more the writers) upon getting a hold of a bat, the scientist, stereotypically says, \"I must study it!\"  And, (WARNING! SPOILER AHEAD!) it turns out that our beloved scientist released the bats on purpose, as he later reveals.  That whole plot surprise right there is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. So this guy decides to be all evil and for NO REASON WHAT SO EVER, except just to make him a bad guy, he releases these aggressive, carniverous bats on a small town.  Stupid.  I actually kept slipping in and out of sleep during the end.  This movie is terrible in most aspects.  One good point in it, though is Lou Diamond Phillips, who does a very good job acting as the sheriff.  Overall, avoid this movie, unless you want something that is loaded with pointless, stupid plot twists and story.",

So there are these people who work with bats. One is the \"sexy\" smart, save-the-day woman and the other is the comic-relief black guy. They are asked to go to the town of Gallop, Texas to help with the bat problem. They meet a tough cowboy guy, and the scientist who created the evil bats. The scientist looks scary and drops \"subtle\" hints. Bats attack, they barricade a school (why a school? I don't know). They play opera music, the black guy doesn't like it, hilarity ensues. Then they get attacked by the evil bats. Shockingly, the chicken-wire doesn't hold them off. Equally shockingly, the generator doesn't work, so they can't electrocute the bats. And, most shockingly of all, the scientist guy tells us that he created the evil bats... ON PURPOSE. Then the bats kill him, the rest go to the bat cave and kill all the bats and they all live happily ever after. Bad, bad movie.",

            "content": "The title tells you what this movie is about... and that's exactly what you get. Bats! Lots and lots of bats! A mix of Arachnophobia meets The Birds, Bats came out at a time where monster movies weren't big at the cinemas, but it has enough horror movie undertones to make it qualify for the climate of slasher flicks that were popular in the late 90's.And for as many movies as there have been over the years with bats in the background (mainly vampire flicks or any of the Dracula pictures) the nocturnal rodents hadn't realy had their moment in the spotlight. In this film, it's all about the bats. Of course there are stock-standard human characters, who either battle the bats or get killed by them, but the movies soars best when it focuses on the flying killers.Set in the small town of Gallup, Texas, the local bats are actually far from local. As we quickly learn, they were a science experiment overseen by a controlling doctor who wanted to see what would happen if he could make the bats better. Claiming they escaped the lab and were probably breeding with local bats, the scientist is joined by two wildlife zoologists and the local sheriff, who are all pulled into the dilemma to find the bats and bring their blood-soaked reign of terror to an end. And as you might have expected, these are no ordinary bats. They are highly aggressive, coordinated in their attacks, and seek out humans as a snack.Our human characters in Bats are not very-well written, but most of the cast does their best within their cliched roles and limited character development. Some of the lines are downright garbarge in every sense of the word, or mostly just exchanges between characters which serve as providing key information to the audience. The film is most enjoyable when the people just stop talking and the bats start stalking.The idea of thousands if not millions of vicious bats filling the night sky to the point they black out the moon, and descending on a small, unsuspecting town to wreak havoc, is enough to make anyone run and duck for cover. And it's in these scenes, even with their inconsistent special effects, that the director shows some talent at staging a variety of climatic moments. There is the standard attack at the beginning of the film, where the bats pick off a couple making out in their car. Then there's the attack on the towns people, followed by our heroes barricaded in a school they've boarded up with wood and electric fencing.The film does explore imaginative ways to show bats attacking people, and whenever a close up of the feral creatures are on screen, you will see a face that is angry, evil and sinister, which can often come across as comical, but also a bit frightening when handled properly.If you don't like B grade movies about bats killing people, you won't be interested, but if you're open to this kind of thing, you will have some fun with Bats. It's short, swift, often funny, occasionally exciting and never demands very much from you.",

It stars Lou Diamond Phillips (how's the career going Lou?) as sheriff Kimsey, Dina Meyer as Dr. Sheila (basically here so she can say things like \"Bats don't kill people\"), and some dude named Leon who is here to (there is not another black man in this movie) to play the comical(and stereotypical) African American sidekick. The movie also has not one original part. It starts out with (gee whiz, dis ain't never been in a horror film before)a young teenage couple making out. The male hears a creepy noise, so he rolls up the windows and drives away. No wait, that's what an actual person would do. As a traditional movie character, he, of course, goes out to investigate. And guess what happens to the couple. Duh, they're killed by bats. During any of the attack scenes, there is always a couple of close-up shots of the bats. Now, on a $6 million budget, they probably couldn't do much with the bats, but holy crap! These are some pretty fake looking super bats we got here! Anyway, if you're into cheesy horror/science fiction films, you'll probably like this movie. I once called this movie Plan 9 From Outer Space for the 90's, but Battlefield Earth stole that title so I's have to call this .....Hobgoblins for the 90's. That works better anyway.",

Another thought that crossed my mind, was: if they made a sequel would it be better or worse than this film and would it be good? To be honest, when I first saw the commercial which was like 3 seconds - the only thing that I have seen was bats. I thought it would be a vampire-bat movie, meaning that the movie would be about vampires attacking a town and having the ability to turn into bats, something like \"From Dusk Till Dawn trilogy\". (I'm also planning on writing my reviews for the From Dusk Till Dawn trilogy.) In conclusion, I have to give this movie a 5 out of a 10.",

The bats look stupid, and the characters do very unintelligent things.  The movie even has the \"need to start motor - and it won't the first try\" scene...which you see coming several light years away.You can predict early on who will die and who will live.  The bats or the characters make it obvious when the attack is coming - so no element of surprise exists.  What's worse are many of the bat close-ups are filmed in \"confuso-vision\", and you may find yourself looking away from the screen to avoid becoming motion sick.  The great horror movies of yesterday and today make up for a lacking plot and standard techniques by adding \"something extra\".  The director (or screenwriter) of Bats must have been out of ideas.

Unfortunately, I don't think it was done poorly enough to be laughably funny.  By reading others comments, you can see what's wrong with the movie.  I don't need to repeat.I can, however, recommend listening to the commentary track on the DVD featuring the director and Lou Diamond Phillips.  This was funny!  Where to begin?  While we see a young couple making out, Lou comments about the perks of acting.  Though I've often marveled at actors getting paid to kiss beautiful people, it comes across creepy to hear the director and Lead actor talking about it in this context.  Creepier then anything in the movie. They also talk about how the director gave the actors the freedom to explore their characters.  For instance, the director allowed Lou to smoke a cigar and had the actress dye her hair a different color.  If you watch the movie, you realize they're not kidding, this counts as character development!  Also, you learn that several of the actors playing the victims in the film are played by locals.  Unfortunately, these locals, in their brief screen appearances, outshine the leads.Hearing these two gush about the film, the special effects and the 'rich' story is the funniest thing on the DVD.

Why they stayed in town I have no idea, but it gave McCabe a chance to degenerate into mad scientist mode just prior to his death.With an air strike scheduled to bomb the bat's cave (Huh?) it's up to Sheila and Kimsey, they must carry out the original plan: Turn on a huge refrigeration unit and freeze the creatures to death.

Imagine Alfred Hitchcock's `The Birds.'  Now take away every good Hitchcock element of the film and replace the birds with mutant bats with a taste for human flesh.  Mix in a dash of torrid acting by washed up actors and a predictably dull plot and you have the modern marvel of cinema that is `Bats.'  This movie takes itself too seriously to be laughed at like other bad horror films.  Avoid at all costs.",

Namely, i'll be pointing out the errors made with the bats (mind you i've been watching now and then as this movie plays, it's not worth my attention). First off, since when can a single bat overpower a full grown man? One bat flings himself at one nonetheless, and instead of grabbing the bat and crushing it under his boot, he decides to bounce around the cafe knocking over everything that's loose. Second, bats are blind any way you look at it, yet these critters seem to have some red vision - and woe the man who views it, for this is not all. The third point is the fact that when shot at, lots of sparks shoot off the bat, power rangers style, apparently these \"mutated\" bats are made of flintstone. The fourth point (and i'm sure there are more, but in total i've watched this movie for six minutes) is that apparently, bat crap gives off toxic levels of ammonia gas, so naturally the people who enter the lair wear space suits with added padded armor.I'd say this sums up some of the ludicrous material in this movie, and you get the point - bad, bad, bad movie.",

I mean, the nature gone wild genre has covered so much ground in the last three decades. Starting with Jaws, to Grizzlyu with Piranha, Alligator and Arachnophobia and culminating with Lake Placid. There has been other killer creature films since, but what separates this film from the newer films are that these films such as Rogue used cliched ideas in a refreshing way and had a good, well constructed script that used suspense and terror effectively well to tell its story However Bats doesn't do that. Bats uses cliches with a bad script, and it doesn't work. Stick with Jaws, Grizzly and the more recent Rogue.

If there we ever a thing in cinema that could be dubbed a guilty pleasure, its this.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Bats could easily have been Arachniphobia, Snakes on a Plane or Eight Legged Freaks! and you wouldn't really notice much difference. This is mainly because they essentially all centre around the same core premise: animals with a slightly sinister reputation become mutated by a Promethean scientist and besiege an isolated small town, only to be eventually stopped by a scientist/feminist figure, a working class diamond in the rough and a comic relief who just so haoppens to be afraid of said creature. \r\n\r\nDespite a fairly strong effort by Dina Meyer (who this time manages to go a whole movie without getting naked) and a totally believable performance by Leon, the film can not escape its deep genre-confined script and thus is never anything more than a by-the-numbers affair. Lou Diamond Philips in particular feels about as realistic as a Ken doll and at no point is the audience ever led to believe that he may not make it out alive (the premise which made Deep Blue Sea so refreshing could really have helped here).   \r\n\r\nAs with most genre films, the special effects remain the biggest draw and the hideously vampiric bats do successfully satisfy in the creepiness department. Beyond that, Bats stands as nothing more than a time filler. Genre fans may want to watch it if they haven't already but newcomers are better advised to skip straight to Aranchniphobia, Evolution or the far superior Tremors.",

Or just a load of bullshit.  It falls into the latter category.\n\nThe plot involves a a couple of bat experts (Dina Meyer of \"Starship Troopers\" and Leon of \"Cool Runnings\") who hired to by an evil scientist (Bob Gunton of \"The Shawshank Redemption\") to capture and/or kill a swarm of genetically engineered super bats loose in a Texas town.  Of course the stereotypical Texas sheriff (Lou Diamond Phillips, \"La Bamba\") is there to lend a hand as well.\n\nWhy the bats were created in the first place and why Gunton is obsessed with them and believes they follow his every command \"Willard\"-style (but they don't) isn't ever brought up in one of many plotholes.  The ingredients were there for something cool, instead our heroes run around shooting at bats (would a pistol really be the weapon of choice against a zig zagging flying bat?), locking them in a high school, and making plans to freeze the bastards.  No time is given to any kind of character development, so who these people are or why we should give a shit if they're eaten by flying rubber bats is beyond me.\n\nThe cast play this one totally straight without the \"wink at the camera\" which is sorely missed.  Much could have been done with the characters, including Bob Gunton's gung-ho approach to the whole thing.  But the second he starts showing signs of uplifting the film, he's killed off.  The effects aren't terrible for what they are, but better suited had the film chosen the campy route.  The CGI bats don't work as well, nor does fighter pilot footage, filmed with a completely different film stock, look good at all.  Hey, it's 1999 CGI, I guess it ain't horrible.  But what about those fuckin jets?  Oh yeah, that's just recycled footage from \"Iron Eagle II\".  Guess the lifeless rubber bats used up the whole budget.  Or maybe it's Leon paycheck following the critical success of \"Cool Runnings\" 6 years earlier?  He was also in uh...well, he was one of the bad guys in \"Cliffhanger\".  Alongside direct-to-video greats like Lou Diamond Phillips, one wonders how the hell Bob Gunton went from the sadistic warden in \"Shawshank Redemption\" to being eaten by 6 foot rubber bat.  Who knows, who cares.  It's not worth much of anyone's time.",

There's no way to take the material seriously. Genetically engineered bats escape from a government lab, infect other bats outside a small Texas town, and proceed to kill everyone in sight. Of course the government recruits one scientist who is \"the best in the field\" to find a solution to the problem. The movie is filled with bats that look as real as the shark in Jaws. Whether they are animatronic, or computer generated, they rarely look real. But when they swarm, it's a cool sight to see. Director Louis Morneau makes great use of the beautiful landscape, and the quaintness of a small town to give the movie a great atmosphere. The characters are all stereotypical, especially Leon's ultra hip, token black character. But the actors are solid, and keep you interested. Lou Diamond Phillips can't sell a Texas accent to save his life, but he's heroic enough as the sherriff. Dina Meyer...ah me, Dina Meyer. Not only is she one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood, she's also a solid actress, and makes her character tough, and is FAR more credible as a scientist than her Starship Troopers co-star Denise Richards was as a nuclear scientist in The World Is Not Enough. Did I also mention she's has one of the most perfect faces I've ever seen? The movie though, loses a great deal of steam in the third act. When the heroes enter the central nest of the bats at the end, it draws out way too long, and begins to become boring, with a finale that doesn't quite fit with the feel of the rest of the movie. But, if you like drive-in movies, cheesy monster flicks, or need nothing more than to stare at the beautiful Dina Meyer for 90 minutes (that would be me) then this movie is for you. In fact, I'm so taken with her beauty, that I'm going to give the movie an extra half star just for that.",

The bats kill everybody they see, so it's up to a wildlife zoologist (Dina Meyer) and a sheriff (Lou Diamond Phillips) to try and get rid of the bats before it's too late.\r\n\r\n\"Bats\" might have had better success a few years ago, but with the great horror movies that have been made lately, \"Bats\" just can't stand up to them. Sometimes the camera in the movie just goes in circles to where you can't see anything. There's not much plot to the movie other than to get rid of the bats. Finally, \"Bats\" was made in 1999. It's pretty bad when a movie made in the late 90's doesn't even have good special effects.
