            "content": "A beautiful and very emotional \"Harry and Tonto\"-styled movie experience as Oscar-nominee Richard Farnsworth (playing the real-life Alvin Straight) decides to travel on his old riding John Deere mower from Iowa to Wisconsin to see his ailing brother (Harry Dean Stanton) because his driver's license has been revoked, he doesn't like public transportation and he has no one else to drive him. The two brothers have not been on speaking terms for many years and now the clock is literally ticking on one last chance for them to see one another and hopefully make amends for past mistakes. Sissy Spacek gives one of her finest performances as Farnsworth's slightly mentally retarded daughter and the supporting players are all real and heartfelt caricatures of America's heartland. Outstanding film-maker David Lynch (to me the finest living American director, along with Martin Scorsese) goes totally out-of-character with a 180-degree turn from whacked triumphs like \"The Elephant Man\", \"Blue Velvet\", \"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me\" and \"Mulholland Dr.\". He quietly and methodically creates a G-rated family film that has deep messages for people of all ages and backgrounds. He paints a picture of America where the old ways of life are still the most important. Farnsworth (who is a total revelation) was in excruciating pain throughout filming due to terminal cancer and terrible arthritis. Notice he stands very little in the movie and he is almost always filmed from the waist up. Sadly this would be his final performance as he committed suicide shortly after his Oscar nod. He did become the oldest nominee ever in the Best Actor category, but really that will become trivial as time passes and his role will be the thing that shines brightly forever. Truly a legacy production for all involved. 5 stars out of 5.",

            "review_title": "A Shockingly-Straight Story From David Lynch",
            "content": "\"A truly nice story with a moral about brotherly love\" describes this odd David Lynch film. This was especially \"odd\" because it wasn't the kind of film Lynch had been putting out in the last 15 -20 years. Those were dark and shocking films (Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Mulholland Drive) and this is the opposite. I know it disappointed a lot of his fans. Others were delighted by it. Count me as one of the latter, and I own all three of those \"dark\" films, too.This was another supposed-true life story, here detailing an elderly man's trip in a seated lawnmower from western Iowa all the way to Wisconsin to see his ailing brother who he hasn't talked to in years but wants to see before the latter dies. Well, I guess that premise - an old man driving a lawn mower 400 miles - still makes this an \"odd\" film of sorts, so Lynch stays in character with that! Richard Farnsworth plays the title role. He is the type of guy, face-wise, voice-wise, low-key personality-wise, that just about everyone likes. The wrinkles on his face tell many a story. It was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this film was released.The first 25 minutes of this film isn't much, and not always pleasant as it shows the main character's adult and mentally-challenged child (Sissy Spacek) and her tragic past, but once Alvin Straight (Farnsworth) begins his trip, the story picks up. I played this for several friends and they thought the film NEVER picked up, but I am more generous with it. I think it's a hidden gem. To them, it was a sleeping pill.I found his trip pretty fascinating but you have to realize in advance this is NOT going to be a suspenseful Lynch crime story. It IS slow and if that's okay with you, you might like this. Charm enters the picture in some of people Alvin meets along the way, such as a wayward young girl running away and some nice town folks who help the old man out when he gets in trouble. (Henry Cada as \"Daniel Riordan, is a standout in that regard.) Harry Dean Stanton gets third billing, but that's a joke: he's only in the final few minutes of the movie!The Iowa scenery is pleasant. I lived there for several years and can attest to the rolling hills and the rich soil. It's a nice state with nice people....like this movie.",

            "content": "Who would have thought that a movie about a man who drives a couple hundreds of miles on his lawn mower to see his brother, could possibly be good cinema? I certainly didn't. I thought I knew what to expect: one of the most boring experiences of my life. Well I was as wrong as I haven't been wrong too often yet, because this is one of the best, most realistic and honest Hollywood films I've ever seen...Giving a short resume of \"The Straight Story\" isn't very difficult. It's about an old and stubborn man who steps on his lawn mower and drives off to another state to pay his brother a visit when he hears that the man has had a severe stroke. That's already special on itself, but what makes it even more special is the fact that he hasn't seen his brother in ten years because of some stupid argument. In the meantime he has his share of bad luck and problems, but he also meets a lot of people whose lives he influences in one way or another with his philosophical approach to life. Despite all the difficulties he drives on for weeks, not knowing if he will reach his goal: seeing his brother again before it's too late...I can easily understand why there are people who don't like this movie and that's also the reason why I will not say that these people don't have a heart or things like that... This movie hasn't got any flashy action scenes, it is as slow as the lawn mower the man is driving on and no, you don't have to watch it for the nice soundtrack either, because there isn't any. But why should you watch it then? Well, the simple answer is the story. I haven't seen such a touching movie with such a powerful story very often and the fact that this actually comes from Hollywood and - to make things even better - from the Disney Studio's (that's right, the same studios that overwhelm us with sugar sweet nonsense) makes it even more special. I'm not ashamed to admit that I had the tears in my eyes a couple of times while watching it, probably because the whole situation of not seeing someone for many years because of some stupid argument is all too realistic for me.Some people will argue that the story is very shallow, but I really don't agree with that. Perhaps it is because they only see that old man driving on his lawn mower and don't want to think any further. If you look close enough than you'll understand that this man is doing all this because he knows he has once been wrong, that only his pride stood in the way of seeing his brother again and that he wants everybody else to see that too, so they won't make the same mistake. If that isn't deep enough, how much deeper does a story have to go for you then? I would also like to add that this movie really had it all. Some beautiful landscapes (finally an American movie that shows something else than the skyline of New York, Chicago or some other big city), some very fine acting by Richard Farnsworth, Sissy Spacek,... and a very understandable way of telling despite the fact that this is a David Lynch movie. I know now that I was completely wrong by assuming that this movie wouldn't be to my taste. It's one of the very best movies I've seen in a long time. This movie aimed for my heart and hit the bull's eye. I give it the full 10/10.",

            "review_title": "It's hard to imagine that this was directed by David Lynch!",
            "content": "David Lynch is a director known for the weirdness of many of his films. After all, he's helmed \"Eraserhead\", \"Blue Velvet\", \"Dune\" and \"Twin Peaks\"--all very weird films by anyone's standards. However, here he's made a film that is very different in tone from his other famous work--and I wouldn't have suspected he could make such a 'normal' film. Perhaps this is because unlike most of his work, he didn't write \"The Straight Story\"--just directed it. Regardless, it's an exceptional film--one that is really unlike anything else I've seen--and I have seen and reviewed A LOT of films.The film is based on a true story that occurred a few years before the film was made. Alvin Straight was a 73 year-old man whose brother suffered a stroke. Alvin did not have a driver's license, as he had poor vision and was in pretty poor health. So, in order to make it to his brother's home hundreds of miles away, Alvin rigged up a trailer onto his riding mower and set out on a journey that would take him well over a month!While the subject matter is pretty mundane and the story rather slow-going (mostly because Alvin Straight's journey was a very slow one), the film managed to be quite entertaining. The script was excellent, Lynch's direction lovely and Richard Farnsworth was terrific in the film as Alvin Straight. Overall, despite being such a simple story, it is a very special sort of film--one that folks who don't demand action and excitement will enjoy.",

            "content": "Perhaps more than many films, this one is not for everyone. For some folks the idea of slowing down, reflecting and allowing things to happen in their own time is a good description of their personal hell. For others an approach like this speaks to some deep part of themselves they know exists, some part they long for contact with.I suppose it's a function of where I am in my own life these days, but I count myself in the camp of the latter group. I found the meditative pace of this film almost hypnotic, gently guiding me into some realm almost mythological. This is indeed a journey story, a rich portrayal of the distance many of us must travel if we are to come full circle at the end of our days.Much as been written of Mr Farnsworth's presentation of Alvin Straight, though I'm not sure there are words to express the exquisite balance of bemused sadness and wise innocence he conjured for us. Knowing now that he was indeed coming to terms with his own mortality as he sat on that tractor seat makes me wish I had had the opportunity to spend time with him before his departure. I hope he had a small glimmer of the satisfaction and truth he had brought to so many people, not just for \"acting\" but for sharing his absolute humanity with such brutal honesty.Given the realities of production economics, I'm not sure full credit has been given Mr Lynch for the courage he showed in allowing the story to develop so slowly. An outsider to film production, I nonetheless understand there are few areas of modern life where the expression \"time is money\" is so accurately descriptive. Going deep into our hearts is not an adventure that can be rushed, and to his credit Mr Lynch seems to have understood that he was not simply telling a story--he was inviting his viewers to spend some time with their own mortality. No simple task, that.If you'd like to experience the power of film to take introduce you to some precious part of yourself, you could do worse than spending a couple of hours with The Straight Story. And then giving yourself some time for the next little while simply listening to its echoes in the small hours of the night.",

            "review_title": "Genuine rather than saccharine",
            "content": "Whenever I hear a movie being touted because it has no sex, violence, bad language, special effects, and so on, my b.s. detector goes off.  Usually, a movie like that is sentimental hogwash which panders to people who don't want anything to surprise them, but to affirm how superior they are to us craven folk.  So when David Lynch's THE STRAIGHT STORY began getting those kinds of reviews, I was apprehensive, especially since I was not a fan of his other \"uplifting\" story, THE ELEPHANT MAN.  For all the stunning images and the good acting in that film, it seemed more interested in preaching to us than inspiring us.I needn't have worried.  THE STRAIGHT STORY is an honest movie rather than a saccharine one.  Most of that is due to the fact that Lynch and writers John Roach and Mary Sweeney tell it straight and simple for the most part.  There are a couple of homilies by Straight I could have done without, and the shots of grain being harvested are repeated a little too much, but those are only quibbles.  There's no heavy-handed message, no sentimental strings to jerk our emotions, and no condescension towards us and its characters. Instead, they depend on the story to build its own power, and it does, so by the final scene, we are genuinely moved.Of course, casting Richard Farnsworth adds realism to the part.  He really is someone who looks like he's lived through a lot but still perseveres, and except for those homilies, the desire he has to get back together with his brother doesn't seem overly sentimental, because you can sense here is someone who's lived too long and seen too much to be driven by anger for long.  And he knows his time is running out, so he wants to make some peace, not only with his brother, but with his life.  Sissy Spacek also does fine, unmannered work as Straight's daughter.  And although I am a city and suburban boy, the Iowa and Wisconsin landscape are beautifully shot, making me want at least to visit some day.",

Richard Farnsworth caps his career with the year's most genuine performance, sad and poetic, flinty and caring.  And Sissy Spacek matches him as his \"slow\" daughter Rose who pines over her own private loss while caring for dad.  Rarely has a modern film preached so positively about family.",

            "content": "I have always been a fan of David Lynch and with this film Lynch proved to critics that he has the talent, style, and artistic integrity to make films outside of the surreal aura that he's become known for in the past decade. As much as the film is G-rated, it's pure Lynch in style, pacing, and tone. The film moves at a masterfully hypnotic pace and is filled with scenes of genuine emotion and power.The cinematography is terrific, as is to be expected from a Lynch film, and the transitional montage sequences are breathtaking. It's also very refreshing to see a film where the characters are all friendly, kindhearted folk and not unmotivated characters that are clearly labeled as being either \"good\" or \"evil\".Richard Farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast, most notably Sissy Spacek in an endearing performance as his daugher, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role.With this film, David Lynch proved to critics that he could make a powerful moving motion picture just like he did in the 80's with 'Blue Velvet' and 'The Elephant Man'. Critics seemed to lose faith in the past decade after he produced such surreal films as 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me' and 'Lost Highway' but with this film he showed that there was method to FWWM and LH, and it looks as if critics finally caught on with his recent film 'Mulholland Drive', considering the high praise it's received and the Oscar nomination for Lynch.'Straight Story' is to me one of the most moving motion pictures I've ever seen.  It's a loving story about family, friendship, and the kindness of strangers. I would highly recommend it.",

I don't think I can add very much to the previous reviews that sum it up so nicely, but I'll do my best. The Straight Story is not a complex movie, the script is quite simple but it didn't need to be. Despite its simplicity, the script is also very moving and literate and you can tell a lot of heart went into shaping it. The film is also quite meditative in its pace, but again that didn't bother me at all, because as a quite reflective piece of work the meditative pace was deliberate. Besides, even if they were flaws, which I don't think they are if anything they are strengths in regards to The Straight Story, the film has a number of things to love about it. For one thing, the Straight Story is beautifully filmed with the cinematography fluid and the scenery spellbinding. The score adds to the film's poignant tones, in terms of direction The Straight Story is one of Lynch's best directed movies and the story while simple is beautifully told and surprisingly warm too. Also Richard Farnsworth gives a wonderful lead performance, he genuinely moved me and I felt for his character too. In conclusion, a beautiful film and one of Lynch's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The last road he drives down is particulary haunting in this context, as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount.  The last mechanical failure could be seen as a death, and the miraculous rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife, in which he achieves the desired reunion.I only hope some of the people who branded this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more holistic attention.",

Though Straight can barely walk, he refuses a Zimmer frame, opting instead to make use of two canes to get around. One day, Straight discovers that his estranged brother Lyle- who lives some 240 miles away in Wisconsin- has had a stroke and is near death's door. Having no automobile but wanting to see his brother, the strong-willed Straight decides to use his lawn-mower to make the journey, despite the daunting nature of the task. On an odyssey through the American countryside, will Straight make it all the way to Wisconsin before his John Deere breaks down?Based on true events, David Lynch's 'The Straight Story' is a beautiful film that works as a lyrical ballad for the American landscape and a moving character study both. John Roach and Mary Sweeney's screenplay weaves a powerfully unaffected tale that speaks volumes about the human condition. Like Hemingway, the dialogue is simple and profound, and the story full of subtleties. As Straight embarks on his quest, we learn of his life- as well as the lives of the characters he encounters along the way- and the film becomes a tapestry of American Midwestern existence.Containing much warm-humor and genuine drama, 'The Straight Story' is Lynch's least abstract film and arguably his most emotionally percipient. As Straight plods ever onward, his mower straining over hills, the simplicity of the central narrative disappears, and the film becomes epic in scale. Like a Greek tragedian, Lynch uses Straight's story as a canvas to explore human nature, connecting with the audience on a deeper, more profound level. By the time the credits roll, viewers will have gone on an emotional journey as lengthy and impactful as Straight's 240-mile quest; and one just as memorable.Often, Lynch uses the same core crew for his films, and 'The Straight Story' reunites him with many of them; cinematographer Freddie Francis being just one. Francis captures the majesty of the American landscape incredibly, putting one in mind of the work of N\u00e9stor Almendros and Haskell Wexler from Terence Malick's 'Days of Heaven.' With amber waves of grain rippling like an ocean in the wind, red barns erupting from yellow cornfields, the night sky draped in starlight sitting over the world like a crown; the film is a visual feast.Lynch has stated that a successful film is comprised of \"sound and image flowing together through time,\" positing that, in scenes, visuals and sounds must complement each other; as they do masterfully throughout 'The Straight Story.' The late, great Angelo Badalamenti's score is haunting and melodic, tonally matching Francis' visuals perfectly. The film's stunning marriage of sound and image is unforgettable and evocative work, held together adroitly by Lynch and Sweeney's unobtrusive editing.'The Straight Story' stars Richard Farnsworth as Alvin Straight, delivering a tour de force performance of great emotional sagacity and depth. He is completely authentic and utterly charming, carrying with him a mournful air that is most affecting. Throughout his decades long career, Farnsworth gave some terrific performances in a variety of projects. Whether in 'Comes A Horseman,' 'The Grey Fox,' or 'Misery;' he was always believable, often making his fellow actors look mannered and forced through his ease of performance. As Straight, he never puts a foot wrong; turning in what may be one of the finest, most subtle pieces of acting ever captured on film. That he didn't win the Academy Award for his efforts is frankly shameful, and a testament to the fact that the Academy more often than not get it wrong.All from the supporting cast do commendable work, with Sissy Spacek impressing greatly as Straight's daughter Rose, who has some sort of learning difficulty. Spacek doesn't overdo the eccentricity of her character, giving a very measured and thoughtful performance that is a highlight of her filmography. Additionally, Harry Dean Stanton has a short but unforgettable scene where he demonstrates in thirty seconds the boundless depth, range and pure acting prowess that endeared him to so many; and just may leave you in tears.Powerful and poignant, David Lynch's 'The Straight Story' is- for all intents and purposes- a flawless piece of filmmaking. With a strong screenplay from Mary Sweeney and John Roach and captivating cinematography from Freddie Francis- not to mention the great score from Angelo Badalamenti- it is brilliant from start to finish. Featuring impactful performances from the likes of Sissy Spacek and Harry Dean Stanton, and anchored by a career best Richard Farnsworth; 'The Straight Story' is about as close to perfect as a film can come.",

            "content": "Titled after the family names of two brothers, The Straight Story is a true American classic. It would be a very good choice to watch, when you get together with your family.The Straight Story has its plainness and \"straight\"ness, as the first thing to say. The plainness segment includes no technical features; no audio or video aspects, no set decoration or cinematography work, no make-up and no costume. In fact with the use of this plainness David Lynch brings the restful country life to your view.Taking a road trip from Iowa to Wisconsin, a World War-II veteran plunges unhesitatingly into the river of his passion, driving his way with a 1966 John Deere lawnmower, and with his defect of eyesight. I didn't know the lawnmowers are made for traffic since I watch this film. Well, nothing is strange enough in David Lynch' s point of view. Despite this strangeness Lynch offers a complete sagacity through Alvin Straight(Richard Farnsworth)'s successful acting and Sissy Spacek as his daughter accompanying him. Thus, you get the straightness segment through those dialogues full of sagacity.Lynch has filmed his story along the roads that the real life Alvin Straight traveled in 1994. Wisely, Lynch dished out his work very economically except he has used a helicopter to let us see how slowly Alvin driving his lawnmower on the road from bird's eye-view. Still, Lynch could have cut some of the scenes which overshadow the smooth style of the film. His Straight Story taught us the importance of finishing whatever we started.",

            "content": "Spoilers herein.Lynch lives in a very troubled world. His pictures are characterized by being presented through the mind of the protagonist. Here, the protagonist is a simple old man, who thinks slowly and simply. So that's what we get. He has long erotic meditations on fecundity on the path of life (14 kids!), so that is what we see.Lynch must be laughing into his gasmask at those who think this is a Hallmark card. Consider these Lynchisms:-- the deerslaying woman (killed the same number of deer as Straight had kids)-- the man in the bar sharpening his knife-- the graveyard-- the `twin' with the jaw prosthetic-- the burning house-- the fat useless woman from next door-- the WWII hauntings-- the retarded daughter who has had her children taken away (and the mirror of the pregnant runaway who likely will also)-- the brother's glance at the end. Look at it again if you think it is appreciative reconciliation. That glance is why they needed an actor of the caliber of Stanton who was also familar to Lynch.Add to this the notion that Farnsworth knew he was dying and had already planned suicide. This is a very disturbed world, reinterpreted through the elder Kurosawan eye of the determined elder Straight to seem more desperately rosey than it is. Consider this like the first half of \"Mulholland Drive,\" and a more intelligent film it is, because it asks you to provide the last half.The magic in the movie is not that it is saccharin, nor that it has strychnine, but that it is an homage to other filmmakers: Altman, Kurosawa, de Palma, Greenaway. Straight has his memories which he plays over and over, and so does Lynch.",

The slow pace was set by the mode of travel (a riding lawn mower with a big trailer) and was maintained by the background sights and sounds and the slow-paced lives of the other characters.The story actually happened; Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76. There was no acting; everything was completely real, as if the actors had actually transformed into the characters. Sissy Spacek gave a poignant performance as a somewhat disabled daughter who had suffered much but forged ahead, always wanting to do the right thing. Richard Farnsworth was cast perfectly and he beautifully became Alvin Straight, a stubborn but loving elderly man who treks across Iowa to visit his estranged brother, Lyle, who has had a stroke. Alvin had learned much wisdom during his life and that seemed to bring out the best in the people that he encountered along the way.The film underscores the importance of family to this man and, hopefully, to all of us. I eagerly anticipate seeing it again, and again. Directed by David Lynch, this films proves his directorial skill. Farnsworth was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor; at 79, he was the oldest nominee ever for that award.",

            "content": "David Lynch usually makes films that resemble puzzles put together the wrong way. They are interesting to look at and think about but they really don't gel in your mind. Perhaps art will always mean the most to its creator.The Straight Story is not a typical David Lynch film. Not that there's anything typical about them anyway. It's an odyssey through rural America. A real life journey Alvin Straight took on a lawn mower to get to his brothers house. He rode 300 miles from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin to make amends to his sick brother for past offenses.At the heart of this film is sweet voiced Richard Farnsworth. He brings Alvin Straight right to us in a simple and honest way. The fact that the film is slow paced matches Alvin's slow journey toward realization.Along the way Alvin meets a confused and frightened young girl. She is pregnant and has decided to run away from her situation. After listening to Alvin speak about family she reconsiders.Later Alvin witnesses a distraught woman kill a deer with her car. She complains that she has killed several and leaves. Alvin feels bad but is smart enough to cook up some dear meat that night.Later Alvin's lawn mower loses its brakes and nearly kills him. A nice man and his wife let him stay in their yard while he gets it fixed. They even let him call his sweet but slow daughter, nicely played by Sissy Spacek, whose haunted by a terrible tragedy in her own past. Alvin insists on paying for the call. The man even offers to drive Alvin to his brothers with pleasure. Alvin declines with thanks.While Alvin waits he also goes off to a bar with a kindly old man as they discuss the harshness of war and the price it took on their souls. Alvin even confesses a fatal mistake he made as a sniper that has forever haunted him.Alvin also encounters two bickering brothers who've repaired his lawn mower. He talks them down in price wisely calling them on their high labor and repair costs. He even helps them to appreciate one another learning from his own mistakes with his brother.The night before Alvin leaves the man's yard he takes his hat off to him. The man tells him it was an honor having him stay and asks Alvin to write to him. This scene is perfect in it's simplicity. It's heartfelt because it's so straight, so real.The journey continues and we can't help to get more and more involved with it. We want Alvin to get to his brothers. We want him to make amends. We want to know this world is full of forgiveness.This was Richard Farnsworth at his best. It was his last film and his performance was amazing. You can't help but to understand his pride, to listen to his wisdom, and to ultimately feel his pain. One becomes as taken with him as the man who offers him his back yard to stay in.If there's justice in the afterlife then Alvin Straight, his brother, and Richard Farnsworth are together sitting at a bar. I can picture them discussing their lives, regrets, hopes, and joys. As Alvin says in the film, \"My brother and I used to look up at the stars.\" Well, I know they all are with the best view in the house.",

His medical condition is poor, his life is mostly behind him and he knows it.This makes what he decides to do, even more remarkable and endearing. He decides (and at every point in the film his own name reverberates through his actions) to put a few things straight.Alvin is, by this time in his life, a man of great experience but modest means. His daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek) struggles with a speech impediment that makes communication a great effort on the audience's behalf. But it's worth it, because Rose's story cannot help but come out as the film progresses.This film is the story of a journey. But like all journeys it is a journey in the geographical sense and in the human sense. Early on in the film, we begin to understand that this is an ambitious journey, which no elderly gentleman of Alvin's age should reasonably undertake.But along the way, we slowly learn how Alvin has so many qualifications which equip him to achieve his unlikely objective. His objective is very simple and straightforward. His brother is ill and likely to die and he wants to visit him. He has had a falling out with him many years ago and they have not spoken in a very long time.Along the way, Alvin meets many people. The way he behaves towards them and the benefit they get from having known him is the essence of this film. We come to know who Alvin Straight is, from what Alvin Straight does. And at the end of the film, we know who we are .. better.",

We begin with a simple family living a quiet life but end up with an array of absurdly interesting characters with depth in their lives that cannot be apparent from their introduction.  Especially moving was the bar scene with two WWII veterans discussing the events of fifty years ago and how it still affected their current lives and emotions.

            "content": "Upon The Straight Story release in 1999, it was praised for being David Lynch's first film that ignored his regular themes of the macabre and the surreal. Based on a true story of one man and his journey to visit his estranged brother on a John Deere '66 mower, at first glance its an odd story for Lynch to direct. Yet as the story develops you can see some of Lynch's trademark motifs coming through.Lynch's focus on small town America and its inhabitants is still as prevalent as in his previous efforts such as Blue Velvet or Twin Peaks, but the most notable difference is that the weirdness is curbed down. The restrictions imposed means that the film has the notable accolade of being one of the few live action films that I can think of that features a G rating. Incredibly significant, this films stands as evidence that beautiful and significant family films can be produced.The Straight Story was the first feature which Lynch directed where he had no hand at writing. For many Lynch devotees this was a huge negative point. Almost universally acclaimed, the only overly negative review by James Brundage of filmcritic.com focused on this very criticism, that it wasn't a typical Lynch film. \"Lynch is struggling within the mold of a G-Rated story that isn't his own.\" Brundage claims, with his protagonist Alvin Straight \"quoting lines directly from Confucious.\" He argues that the story is weak and the dialogue even worse. Yet this is about the only criticism that many will read for the film. Whilst it is true that it is not Lynch in the sense of Eraserhead, Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive - all films which I also adore, The Straight Story features a different side of Lynch that is by no means terrible. If you are a Lynch fan, it is most important to separate that side of Lynch with this feature.The narrative is slow and thoughtful, which gives you a real sense of the protagonist's thoughts as he travels to his destination. Alvin constantly is reminded about his past and his relationships with his wife, children and his brother. Yet particularly significant is that there are no flashbacks, which only adds to the effect, which reminded me of my conversations with my grandparents. The conclusion arrives like watching a boat being carried down a slow meandering river and it is beautiful to watch. The natural landscapes of the US are accentuated and together with the beautiful soundtrack by Angelo Badalamenti, makes me yearn to go to America. The performances are also excellent with every actor believable in their roles and Richard Farnsworth is particularly excellent. His Oscar nomination was greatly deserved and it was a shame that he didn't win. Regardless, however it is probably the finest swan-song for any actor. So whilst The Straight Story features none of Lynch's complex narratives or trademark dialogue, the film is a fascinating character study about getting old and comes highly recommended!",

The true story of Midwest farmer Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth, in his final role) driving his tractor down a highway to visit his estranged brother, the movie makes us call into question our own lifestyles. Alvin may be about at the end of his rope, but he knows that he has to make amends sooner or later.All in all, this is a very interesting change of pace for director David Lynch. The man usually known for the likes of \"Eraserhead\", \"Blue Velvet\" and \"Mulholland Dr.\" looks at the rustic life and how certain things in it may have to change. It's certainly a movie that I recommend to people. Equally as good as Farnsworth are Sissy Spacek as Alvin's speech-impaired daughter Rose, and Harry Dean Stanton as Alvin's brother Lyle. Also appearing (as the tractor salesman) is Everett McGill, whom you may recognize from \"Silver Bullet\" and \"The People Under the Stairs\".A very unique movie indeed.",

            "content": "Perhaps the greatest thing about David Lynch's \"The Straight Story\" is the Disney logo which pops up before the film begins. The film pretends to be a \"straight story\", the cosy adventure of a heroic old man who travels across America to visit his brother, but is many ways a tale every bit as terrifying as Lynch's other features.\"Story\" begins with shots of a Midwestern night sky. Lynch tells us its a cosmic graveyard, each star representative of \"passed on\" human spirits (Lynch believes in this New Age nonsense, so we'll allow the hokiness). We then get several melancholic shots of a small Iowan town. It's all quite peaceful, until Lynch begins to dwell on the grotesque. And so we see an ugly women, obsessed with beauty products, munching on food out in her garden. She's so self-absorbed she doesn't notice her neighbour, the elderly Mr Alvin Straight, collapsing in his home.Alvin is then taken to a doctor. His legs no longer work and so he is given two walking canes. The doctor says he'll be dead soon but Alvin doesn't share this news with his daughter. \"He says I'll live to a hundred,\" Alvin lies. As the film progresses, it's clear that Alvin Straight isn't ever straight with anyone. Alvin's daughter is called Rose, but there's nothing rosy about her life. She has a mental disability and makes bird houses. Why houses? Because she lost her four children to the state when a fire destroyed her home. It wasn't Rose's fault, though. She had left her kids in the care of \"someone else\". But who was this \"someone else\"? Alvin, after learning that his brother suffered a stroke, sets off to visit his sibling in Mount Zion, a place, we assume, of symbolic redemption. But Alvin can't legally drive (he has no license), and so he hops on board his \"reds\" lawnmower and sets off on a slow journey. Unfortunately Alvin's mower promptly stops working. He responds by taking out a gun and \"putting it down\" like a wounded animal. This is the first sign that there is some violence buried deep within Alvin.From here on the film tells its tale via several symbolic episodes. Alvin upgrades to a green 66 John Dere lawnmower and passes an old woman whose dead husband rode a \"reds\". He then meets a young girl who says she's running away from her parents. This mirrors Rose wishing she hadn't lost her kids. Later, Alvin's pathetic lawnmower is overtaken by a crowd of young bicyclists and huge, virile trucks. \"Worse part of being old is remembering when you was young,\" he says later. Death is approaching the old man, but what he really means is that he hates remembering what he did when he was young. He wants to atone for some hidden past.Alvin then meets a woman who has bizarrely run over 14 deer on the highway. We recall that Alvin had fourteen kids. That's a big family, but where have they all gone? Dead on a highway? Driven apart by something? Alvin, who throughout the film is associated with meat and carnality, later guiltily eats the dead road kill whilst four deer sculptures loom over his shoulder. Didn't Rose have four children? The next day Alvin mounts the deer's antlers on his John Deer lawnmower.Alvin approaches a hill, his brakes failing when he notices a burning house in the distance. The audience recalls that Rose's children were lost in a fire. Alvin, now without mower, spends the night camping out in a family's garden whilst he waits for his mower to be fixed. He makes it clear that he doesn't feel worthy enough to step foot in their home. The \"nice family's\" modern cordless phone is contrasted with Alvin's old wired phone. They are free, Alvin is weighed down by something.Later, Alvin shares a beer with an old man. He talks about how he used to be an alcoholic, using booze to get rid of the trauma of war, and how a priest cured him of his \"disease\" when he got back to America. But is this true? If Alvin gave up drinking shortly after WW2, why did drink cause the fight with his brother Lyle? Meanwhile, a man plays with a knife in the bar.Alvin meets two brothers who constantly argue. One has a bandage on his chin. He's been cut. In the next scene, Alvin makes a stop at another bar. He's on the verge of seeing his brother for the first time in years and now here he is, seeking solace in the beverage that drove them apart?The film ends with Alvin driving his mower up to Lyle's house. His engine mysteriously shuts down. He's unable to go through with it, unable to face his brother, unable to look his sibling in the face. A \"bigger tractor\" then approaches, shaming Alvin into completing his journey. Alvin then ambles up to Lyle's house and sits with his brother out on the front porch. They are Cain and Abel (Alvlin with two walking canes, Lyle with his able walker), looking mournfully up at the night sky; imminent death will end their torment.And so we have the tale of a man who returned from war a violent brute. He impregnated his wife, beat his children and was disowned by his family. Alvin then became an abusive drunk who cut his brother and lost his daughter's kids in a fire. A man who lost control of his car, lost his license, lost his wife and lost his own kids in an accident. And so Alvin Straight is riding his mower, not as an act of forgiveness, but as an ordeal of atonement. Actor Richard Farnsworth, who plays Alvin, would commit suicide soon after. Creepily fitting.9/10 - Worth multiple viewings.",

As often seems to happen with \"based on a true story\" movies, the script gets stretched pretty thin at times (the parable about the sticks that Straight tells the teenage runaway seemed familiar from grade school), and the backstory that slowly emerges may seem a little too pat, but Farnsworth's disarmingly natural acting style is just right for the part, and Lynch's eye for the hidden beauty of the nondescript landscape and his perfect pacing bring out all the drama and poignancy of Alvin Straight's journey.

Straight is struggling to come to terms with his own mortality when he learns that his estranged brother is also having health issues that may ultimately leave them with unresolved issues.All of his associates seem to agree that Alvin remains of sound mind and, for the time being, that seems to be enough to counter balance his rapidly advancing physical deficiencies. That is until he reveals the unconventional and extremely dangerous method of travel that he plans to use to make the approximate three hundred and fifty mile trip to visit his brother Lyle.I can't imagine that there's anyone in Hollywood who could have played the leading role of Alvin Straight better than Richard Farnsworth, whose performance earned him an Oscar Nomination for Best Actor. Sissy Spacek's portrayal of his mentally challenged daughter Rose, is phenomenal as well. They never pinpoint her affliction, but I'm guessing that it's some form of autism. She stutters badly and is somewhat slow-witted, but highly independent and has an uncanny knack for remembering facts, historical and otherwise. The brevity of her on screen appearance may well have been the only thing that kept her from receiving yet another Academy Award Nomination for her work here.Prior to seeing the opening credits I had no knowledge, whatsoever, of the actual making of the film. When I saw the \"G Rating\"; I was surprised. When I saw that it was a Walt Disney Production, I was intrigued, but you could have knocked me over with a feather when I realized that David Lynch was its director.This only helped to confirm what I'd felt all along. David Lynch's talents, in terms of style and imagery, are bound by nothing, including his lack of involvement in the writing of this piece. Despite the limitations of the MPAA rating and the guidelines of Walt Disney, which I imagine are at least somewhat restrictive, this was Lynch in his classic style and at his finest. What he's done, in effect, is produce a work for all ages and cinematic taste without compromising his own technique. By the way, those of you who aren't familiar with his other work have no idea what I'm talking about. I hope that those of you who are can relate.Although I only recently saw this film, over the years I had heard many wonderful things about its subject matter from individuals whose taste in movies I fully trust. With that in mind, there was little doubt that I would consider this to be anything less than tube time well spent. However, nothing anyone ever told me could have prepared me for the degree to which it would touch me on a personal level. Alvin Straight reminded me very much of my grandfather, who had a third grade education and is still the smartest man I've ever known. This film eloquently illustrates the patience, wisdom, courage and yes stubbornness of a generation that is all but extinct. While the elder generations are and will always be, in essence, living history, individuals like Straight are all but gone. Soon the option to listen and learn about past events, first hand, from the accounts of our contemporaries who remain uncorrupted by the influence of the modern age will be gone as well.",

            "content": "When I read a review of The Straight Story, I fell in love with the idea. An elderly man travels by lawn mower from Iowa to Wisconsin, over 370 miles, just to patch things up with his estranged brother, before it's too late.I have to admit to being an enormous fan of road movies, and The Straight Story is one of the more interesting. In more ways than one. For one thing, the director is David Lynch. He is credited for some of the most unusual films and ideas, ranging from Twin Peaks to Dune.The world of the surreal is nothing new to Lynch, but then, neither is the road movie. He already explored this genre with Wild at Heart, but The Straight Story is a polar opposite. The title in of itself is very appropriate, because the story is told completely straight. There is no oddball surrealism, so don't count on dancing dwarfs or red curtains for this one. In fact, this must be David Lynch's most accessible film to date.I was interested to discover this was based on a true story. Perhaps when I'm in my 70's, I might partake on such an adventure. The man in question is Alvin Straight (A marvellous final performance from Richard Farnsworth). A man who is not in the best of health. He has a bad hip, so must walk on two canes, and has very poor eyesight.He lives in a small Midwestern town, one of those towns where everybody knows everybody. Some of the people are eccentrics, which shows some of Lynch's trademarks are still intact. Alvin also lives with his mildly retarded daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek). Alvin is a friendly, decent man who seemingly wouldn't hurt a fly.But his personable demeanour hides some painful memories. He hasn't spoken to his brother, Lyle, in ten years. The film never gives a straight answer why they fell out. When Lyle suffers a stroke, Alvin decides to bury the hatchet, and make amends with Lyle.But as I've said, the two of them are 370 miles apart, Alvin doesn't have a drivers license, and Rose for obvious reasons can't drive him. But Alvin does have an automotive lawn mower. He hitches a trailer to the back of it, and sets off on a journey across America to be with Lyle.Alvin meets quite an array of interesting characters on his journey. Some of them are lonely, like Alvin himself. He meets a pregnant girl, unsure whether or not to have her child, a fellow WW2 veteran, a weird woman who's hit one deer too many, a couple of bickering brothers, etc.Even after watching the film for the first time, I can already tell this is a very nuanced film. There is a richness and multilayered approach to Alvin's encounters that resonate on many levels. Richard Farnsworth was really at the top of his game here. His good natured performance is perfectly attuned to the material, and his acting with his co-stars is superb. Some of the dialogue is almost poetic, and touches many emotional nerves, my favourite being the tragic story of Alvin's days as a sniper in WW2.I could describe the encounter, but you really need Farnsworth's performance to get the full effect. The cinematography is beautiful, showing golden sunlight that illuminates the whole picture, and the music compliments the tone of the film perfectly.The finale is curiously open ended, but it is perhaps best left that way. After following Alvin throughout his odyssey, and listening to him open his heart to so many people, he deserves some privacy with his brother.A truly marvellous film, and the best road movie since Planes, Trains & Automobiles. Both films are similar because they both have a lot of honesty to their central protagonists, as well as poignancy in light of Richard Farnsworth's death. A fitting epitaph to an extraordinary man.Richard Farnsworth was terminally ill during production. Diagnosed with cancer, he committed suicide once the film was completed. He came out of retirement to make it. I believe he'd made up his mind what he was planning to do afterwards. Farnsworth knew this was going to be his last film, and this is what makes it such a powerful fable. He poured every last drop of emotion into the project. It only makes Alvin seem even more poignant. And the story that much more potent.One last thing. I know I'll never look at a tractor driving on the road in the same way again. You never know where they might be going.",

I'm here in Brazil, thousands of miles away, but thanks to music and movies, I have all very close to me, in my heart. But I will talk about this wonderful film. Alvin's journey to review your brother, sick, piloting a small garden tractor, is something that hits bottom our hearts and minds. It is impossible not to be infected by the admirable spirit of Alvin. The stages of the journey are also steps to reflect. Alvin, demonstrating a huge detachment and an uncommon strength of character, embarks on a journey that is a true epic. In his small tractor is slowly going through a beautiful area, finding the most different people in their way. And Alvin influences the life of each of them, with their way of being, with its observations and with his charisma. But it is also affected by what he sees and the people with whom they live. It is undoubtedly a powerful film. It is one of the best and most touching films ever made, a true masterpiece of cinema, a time of great inspiration from David Lynch.",

It's one of Lynch's better films in my opinion. As kind of a flip-side to Blue Velvet, it is a celebration of America rather than an exposure. I saw it a few nights ago and found myself moved and alienated at the same time - similar, actually, to The Elephant Man. I think the way Lynch creates a feeling of detachment, while still evoking a lot of subtle emotion, in both these movies is particularly effective. It's strange, but not just for the sake of being so.Richard Farnsworth (RIP) is excellent in the film. Sissy Spacek is rather annoying -- but the character calls for it, I suppose. We also get a small role at the end by the great Harry Dean Stanton, playing Farnsworth's estranged brother.Farnsworth committed suicide shortly after the movie's release and it's strange to watch this knowing it was his last film, because the general theme of the movie -- old-age, the acceptance of death and the search for affirmation -- is made all the more significant and haunting.In a way, a very eerie, unsettling movie -- but also a beautifully photographed, wonderfully directed character piece and an ode to life -- which is really out of the norm considering it's a Lynch film.",

When he hears Lyle's health is fading, Alvin, whose own health isn't the greatest, is determined to visit him by himself and make amends. With no driver's license, he sets out to make the three-hundred-mile trip to Mount Zion, Wisconsin on a sturdy green 1966 John Deere lawnmower ...Well, I never thought I'd see the credits, \"Walt Disney Pictures Presents A Film By David Lynch\", but that's just the beginning of the charm of this beautifully made and extremely touching movie. Based on a true story (and dedicated to the man it is about), it's a great odyssey movie as Alvin slowly travels across the picturesque Iowa farmlands and shares his accumulated wisdom with those he meets. Watching this reminds me just how formulaic so many movies are, and how refreshing it is to see a movie where almost all the cast are senior citizens, and the pacing takes plenty of time to develop the characters. It's extremely well edited by Mary Sweeney (who also co-wrote and co-produced it), and masterfully directed by Lynch. Whilst it may not be as stylish and exotic as some of his other work, it captures the beauty of the landscapes and the dignity of old age without ever resorting to sentiment or clich\u00e9. The deceptive simplicity of his technique here, such as in the many shots of the night sky, create a tremendous spiritual depth to the film whilst simultaneously serving the story. Farnsworth, after a long career as a stuntman, somehow managed to specialise in playing feisty old codgers (see The Grey Fox, Misery, etc); this was his last and perhaps his greatest performance, ably supported by Spacek as his daughter (she and production designer Jack Fisk are old pals of Lynch from his Eraserhead days). The haunting traditional violin / guitar score by Angelo Badalamenti and the fabulous photography by Freddie Francis (himself an octogenarian) top off what is almost a perfectly realised film. Not to be missed. 7/10",

            "content": "I have a hard time putting this into words.  In order to convey what I want to say, I'm going to have to give some information about me.I have been a film buff all my life.  Before I went into Information Technology, I spent four years being a film major at both BYU and the University of Utah.  I estimate that I have seen over 6000 films in my lifetime.  I have many personal favorite films of all genres.  I am considered by my friends and family the most reliable (and un-shut-up-able) source when it comes to gauging, rating, and examining films.So, when I say that The Straight Story TOPS THE LIST OF MY PERSONAL FAVORITE FILMS, it really, really means something.This movie is directed by David Lynch, who I consider one of the top five American filmmakers, right up there with Martin Scorcese and Stanley Kubrick.  Likely, unless you're a film buff or an old Twin Peaks fan, you've never heard of David Lynch.  Most of David Lynch's movies are considered cult films.  Ever heard of Blue Velvet?  Wild At Heart?  Lost Highway? Eraserhead?  Or even the recent film Mulholland Drive?  If you haven't, it just means you're neither a small-film connoisseur nor a David Lynch fan. And, unless you have a taste for unusual, dream-like, sometimes unsettling (a.k.a. 'artsy-fartsy') cinema, then you never need to remember the name David Lynch.However, to everyone else in this entire world who is willing to devote 2 hours of their short life to watching a movie, there are two films David Lynch has made that should appeal to anyone: The Elephant Man (made in 1980), and The Straight Story.The Straight Story is about the true life experience of a man named of Alvin Straight.  He lived in a small town in Ohio.  He was 73 years old when he decided to visit his younger brother in Michigan who had suffered a stroke. He hadn't spoken to his brother in 11 years, due to an old quarrel.  Alvin had bad eyes, he could not drive himself in a car there.  He doesn't like others driving for him.  So, he hitches a trailer to his riding-mower for use as a sleeping compartment, packs lots of hotdogs and braunaschwerger, and starts out towards his brother's place -- at a speed of roughly 10 to 15 miles per hour.Many things happen along the way.  We discover more about Alvin, the way he sees things, what he's been through in his life.  We learn more about he and his brother.  At a couple points, he must swallow his pride and graciously accept the help of good-hearted strangers.  At times, he is able to provide assistance to others.  Richard Farnsworth (who was nominated for the best actor oscar for this movie) plays Alvin Straight.  He died less than one year after it was finished.  Sissy Spacek plays his sensitive daughter in a hugely underrated performance.This movie, to me, represents filmmaking at its highest form of art.  It is an absolutely perfect blend of visual mastery, appropriate musical scoring and musical placement, a well-presented tale truly worth telling, and it is filled with material that the thoughtful viewer can derive personal interpretation from.  Most others that have seen this film really like it -- on the surface it is sweet and simple.  It is a well made, slow-paced but entertaining film, free of anything that could possibly offend even the easily offendible person.  For many viewers, that's all it is and all it will ever be for them.  In my case, when I watch the film, I find in it all the sublimities of life.  I want to get on my hands and knees and weep and thank God for every day I live, all that I have, and all the trials I've been through.  I want to embrace my loved ones and pour all the love of my soul on them.  I want to look into the eyes of every stranger and say \"I genuinely care about your welfare, I respect you no matter what our differences, and I would love to get to know you better.\"  I am full of love and patience for all mankind.  It is one of the only films I have ever seen that truly influences me to be a better human being, and it doesn't have one single preachy moment in it.Maybe it won't do the same for you, but that is the power I feel in this remarkable film.  Although it is rated 'G', it would be tedious for short-attention-spanned kids 12 and younger to sit through.  It would be tedious for short-attention-spanned adults to sit through as well.  If you're the kind of person who'd rather see two hours of Alvin Straight using his riding-mower 'Jackass-style', like shredding melons, pinecones, shoes and other assorted items with the blades, or flying off ramps into muddy pits, then this is not your movie.  Only those who are capable of enjoying a transcendary film experience may apply.",

            "content": "Ever wondered about a movie that takes it time to really get to where it needs to go and yet you trust it to hold your hand along the way? The Straight Story is one of them. Based on the real-life story of Alvin Straight's 1994 journey across Iowa and Wisconsin via lawn mower, the film was a bigger critical hit on its release than it was a commercial hit, so it's fondly remembered to a certain extent. That being said, there are few movies in the world where the laid back tone actually benefits the slow-moving pacing that would almost plague this type of flick. You learn more from these genuine personalities than you'd first think.Now the movie's main plot about elderly countryman Alvin Straight driving from his Iowa home to see his ill brother Lyle in Wisconsin to make amends doesn't sound too interesting at first. That type of straight-forward narrative would probably fit better in a novel or short film than a feature film. However, that plot line is elevated heavily throughout its execution because everywhere and everyone that Alvin encounters stays with the viewers. These include a young hitchhiker with family troubles, a woman who can't stop accidentally running over animals or even friendly neighborhood folk fixing Alvin's mower. All of these individuals have their own fascinating perspectives that add into Alvin's journey across the country that make you want to know more about them all. Even Alvin's own folks back at home are worth analyzing, such as his kind-hearted albeit \"slow\" daughter Rose and the other elderly people who question Alvin's travel method. If a musty impaired man with no driving license can come across memorable encounters along the roads, then what's stopping anyone else from doing so on their own?In addition to the nice characters Alvin meets along the way, the performances really make the movie worth sitting through. Richard Farnsworth is so endearing and sentimental as Alvin that one could listen to him on a 10 hour long radio show and get just as much out of it as an hour and a half. The dialogue he shares with the people he encounters has an almost Hemingway quality to how realistic yet poetic it feels, whether through themes of how strong a family can be, getting old vs having been young or even how a violent mistake can affect you in the long run (Alvin was a WWII veteran after all). Other noteworthy performances come from Sissy Spacek's bittersweet demeanor as Rose and pretty much everyone else Alvin meets along the way; most of the other actors are fairly unknown so you really see them as the characters and not whoever they appear to be. Also, without actually giving away the ending, based on what occurs throughout the movie, this final sendoff really does make that whole trip worth the wait, as if it's meant to be Alvin's own salvation.It's not everyday when a major movie corporation like Disney shares to the world a movie that reflects the simple, non sentimental beauty of the rural Midwest. Needless to say, The Straight Story remains a mature movie through patience and a laid back tone through its story of an old man traveling on his own just to reunite with his estranged brother. As Roger Ebert put it best, this flick isn't only about-\"the old Alvin Straight's odyssey through the sleepy towns and rural districts of the Midwest, but about the people he finds to listen and care for him.\" So why not check this movie out on your own and listen yourself?",

You don't expect a light, quick \u0091n easy movie from Oliver Stone, nor do you expect something serious and dramatic from Wes Craven. That's why most people would not believe you if you told them that The Straight Story was directed by David Lynch. That's right, the person who brought you backwards talking dreams, fetus children, and midget cowboys connected to the mafia now has directed a small, quite story about a 73 year old man who travels 350 miles on a lawnmower to visit his brother, who has had a stroke.At about a two-hour length and multiple shots of just Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) riding his mower across beautiful landscapes, it's easy for people to complain that The Straight Story is boring and pointless. Yes, it doesn't have a quick pace, but if you can put up with that, you'll see that The Straight Story is one of the most refreshing and, so to speak, intoxicating movies of a long time. Alvin Straight is just one of the people you would love to get to know. It's even great to know that there actually was an Alvin Straight in real life, and he's a character that may not be perfect, but he's one hell of a guy.The cinematography is spectacular. Rightly done in a complete wide screen, it was simply beautiful. I'm not one to gush at landscapes, but\u0085wow! It was spectacular. It's hard to believe that there are still actual places like those still left in America. The camera perfectly captured the area that Alvin Straight drove through.What really got to me was just how simple everything was, and instead of letting it all go to shame, it was actually presented simply. There was nothing that was unbelievable about it, and everything was done realistically. Alvin Straight had faults, no doubt, but all people do. There seems to be something almost cosmic about The Straight Story, something hard to explain. It's flowing with some sort of rhythm, everything just comes together.Farnsworth got an Oscar nomination, well deserved. He didn't have to play someone mentally slow (as Sissy Spacek did in The Straight Story) or anything that's usual Oscar grabbing material. He just played an average guy on a mission to perfection. Although Kevin Spacey won for his outstanding job in American Beauty, I think many actors could have done his role. Farnsworth is one of a kind in The Straight Story, just like the movie itself.My rating: 10/10Rated G.",

This is a film that explores the myths and lore of a crumbling empire, attempting to package them all into one work without veering into the abstract or sacrificing a plot while smuggling this intent under the view of the audience. A wretched, cunning, caring, loving, spiteful, stubborn, foolish, wise and kind, weak and strong old man that has done and seen awful things but is good at heart, alone in the world taking care of his simple but bright child, doing good in the end - uncle Sam.Throughout the course of the film unwanted pregnancies have simple causes and solutions, rural strangers are kind and interesting, swindlers are likeable buffoons, family is the most important thing even when you wreck it, war is bad but the fight and camaraderie are good, businesswomen are hysterical clowns with no sense of opportunity, doctors want to help but refusing them is a trait of one's character not trait of one's poverty, inane and dangerous schemes that can easily be executed in a simpler and smarter manner are brave and beautiful and finally in the end there's no need for men to ever talk about their thoughts and feelings with those closest to them.David Lynch is, as always, a brilliant human being.",

            "content": "When his estranged brother suffers a stroke, Alvin Straight resolves to travel the 300 miles to see him and mend the broken bridges that exist between them. Unable to walk very well, unable to drive a car due to his failing eyesight and too stubborn to accept the help of someone driving him there, Alvin sets out on the only mode of transportation available to him \u0096 a John Deere ride-on lawnmower. With supplies in-tow, Alvin leaves his daughter at home and heads out on the road \u0096 a road that holds breakdowns, adventures, friendships and humility.When I saw that David Lynch had made an U rated Disney film I almost did a double-take worthy of the late, great James Finlayson. But, yes, it appears that the man who has continually confused, bewildered and unnerved me over the years. However the fact that this is such a gentle film does not take away from it being very definitely Lynch's film \u0096 the use of music, the focus on the oddities of smalltown folk and the 'quirky' nature of the story all mark it out as his, even if it is hard to reconcile the man who made Fire Walk With Me with the man who made this. The plot is simple and is no more than a series of low key interactions between Alvin and the people he meets along the way. None of them are individually moving, and the film has none of the 'swelling music, tears in eyes' moments that films often do to force emotion from their audiences; instead I felt I was given an unassuming story that has a gentle warmth that never blazes in any one scene but leaves a heat after the film ends. This is not to say it is perfect because it isn't and I can totally understand why some people are mystified about why it is so popular (even I was surprised to find it high in the IMDb 250) because it is very slow and very little actually happens.However what it does do well is to touch on the usual Lynch theme of small town America \u0096 but here there is nothing sinister behind the white pickets, there are not ears to be found here! Instead he swings to the other extreme; everyone is good, life is slow and everyone knows everyone else. I have never been to America and don't know if it is true or not but the film makes you glad to believe it. The minor stories are warm and witty but also touching with more than enough realism to convince and, more importantly, to care. Lynch's direction is solid and the cinematography uses the landscapes to great effect with slow camera movements that match the overall feel of the movie. The music avoids easy cloying sentiment and settles for a nice little score that helps the film to tells us that it is not 'dull', it is being deliberately slow and there is a difference.The cast are pretty good although they are mostly 'good' support characters with little to them save old-worldly charm and values. Farnsworth steal the film of course with a pained performance that he easily falls into \u0096 you believe that this man has lived a whole life and you can see the regrets he has not only in the scenes where he spells them out but also in his total performance. His Oscar nomination may have had a touch of sentiment about it but he did deserve it for such a good performance. Spacek may have a comparatively minor role but she is also excellent in a role that she could have overdone but, I think, got spot on. Support is mostly OK from people like Pearson, McGill and various small town folk, but like I said they generally have thin roles to deliver. Stanton is a nice cameo but he brings nothing to the picture except his face and name.Overall I really enjoyed this film but will be the first to admit that it requires patience and may leave some unsatisfied. I liked its slow burn of emotion and the gentle, affectionate look at small town characters but there is not a great deal to it and I am a bit surprised to find it as high as it is in the top 250 list. As a Lynch film it is both an oddity but also typical \u0096 his usual themes but a surprisingly warm and human touch to much of it. Worth seeing for the gentle warm feeling you will be left with as well as great work from Lynch and Farnsworth but you should not approach this with high expectations \u0096 the film is unassuming and slight, accept that from the start and you'll enjoy it a lot more than someone tuning in for one of the 150 best films ever made (according to IMDb)!",

So simple and determined, great line. At the end, when Alvin finally gets to Lyle's house, the look on his face will bring tears to your eyes. but the real tear-jerking scene is when they are sitting on Lyle's porch, two brothers who haven't seen each other for years, both very old now. Lyle looks at the lawnmower, and says \"Did you ride that thing all the way here to see me?\". Alvin simply replies \"I did, Lyle.\", then Lyle's eyes start to fill with tears. What's even more emotional is that this was Richard Farnsworth's last movie before he died. He ended his career in the best scene of any movie he's ever done. That is one of the most beautiful scenes in movie history. Only movie that has EVER made me cry, EVER. I recommend it to everyone. David Lynch is a genius",

            "review_title": "Lynch plays it straight... Farnsworth IS Straight...",
            "content": "No twist, no sudden reveal, no fancy film-making, as evidenced by the title, \"The Straight Story\" is a simple and straightforward story about a man named Alvin Straight, who went through a five-week journey across the Midwest, from Iowa to Mississippi to settle some record with his dying brother. It is also one of the sweetest and most heart-warming movies from, of all the directors, David Lynch. As if he embraced the name of the main character, Lynch plays it 'straight' and doesn't indulge to his usual trademarks, there are a few bits of weirdness here and there but they all feel genuine and true to life.Alvin Straight is a man in his 70's, his health has been declining, bad hips, bad vision, bad habits, but he's one of these stubborn men who don't like being told what to do. He's quite lucid about his condition and knows his living days are numbered but this is not an existentially stationary film, it doesn't contemplate the passing of time. Like the best existential movies, this one is combined with a road trip, the inevitable parallel between the road and the path we're invited to take in order to discover more about the protagonist then about ourselves, each encounter is the opportunity to learn something. And even in the film, people are curious about Alvin, how couldn't they? When you meet a man in his 70's determined to visit his brother the hard way, riding a lawn mower, you want to have a few words with him.There's a campfire sequence with a young hitchhiker during which he presents one of the most touching metaphors about the value of family, I won't spoil it but the film finds a touching way to show that the message has been heard. Then he meets a group of cocky youngsters and one of them has a very bold question: \"what's the worst thing about being old\". That answer I will spoil because it's all in the speechless reaction it inspires: \"remembering when you were young\". I could feel Alvin was giving the cocky bastard a taste of his own medicine without hurting him, it's not much the memories of being young than simple and straight memories. Our past is what makes the present difficult and the older we are, the heavier the burden is. And as the story progresses, Alvin's relief grows. The longer chapter of this glorious odyssey involves a trip in a small town where Alvin shares a few memories with another World War II veteran and then you realize these people were not called the greatest generation for nothing, the greatness isn't a comment on their human value but the level of crap they had to deal with before supposedly getting back to the real world. These are guys who had jobs, lead a routine life while trying to hide back their trauma under some habits, such as alcohol or smoking, never mind, these things backfired at them and in Alvin's situation, he can only meditate on what's left from his life and translate it into something good and valuable. The trip culminates with an advice given to two brothers that ends with the perfect quotation \"a brother's a brother\".In that scene, there's a moment when he says \"am I charged for something good or something new\", which means that he's supposed to pay for quality rather than newness and that's exactly what Alvin's presence is about. But at that point I should say that's what the presence of Richard Farnsworth is about. The actor, remembered for his performance as the sheriff in \"Misery\" was a former stunt-man and entered the acting business quite late, a late-bloomer as we say, but he managed to garner a lot of attention and Oscar nomination, this performance as well. I think he didn't play an old man, he was himself, which all the positive things and negative if we count the declining health. It is known that the actor was battling cancer and unfortunately, he put an end to his life before the misery (no pun intended) would get worse, but as far as epitaph performance go, there couldn't have been a better one, it felt so real.Whenever he smiles, he cries, he acts or reacts, I see a man with a past as rich and emotional as life can be, and as I hope my life will be, and when health gets declining, you try to keep the spirits in a good mood and never let anyone stop you. \"The Straight Story\" takes a long time to take off, there are many pauses and incident but no matter what, the man keeps on going, he doesn't even let himself go in a house, he calls it stubbornness, it's more than that, this man carries some guilt and he tries to atone for it, it's about faith, it's about dignity. We never know what exactly he did until the end where he's about to say something, and let's just say that the conclusion is just perfect.This is a film to embrace with all the feelings it has to feature, joy, sadness and melancholy and a few installments of oddity that belongs to Lynch, but it also a movie that invite us to appreciate life and nature. There are a lot of great shots in the film, the camera is like caressing the vast landscapes, the wheat fields, the green acres but even a storm is enjoyable, for some reason, like Alvin, like Farnsworth, we embrace the value of these things as perceived by Alvin. That's the power of \"The Straight Story\".",

            "content": "Perhaps the most personal of David Lynch's works is his most accessible. This time, rather than the enigmatic thematic structures that may or may not involve a plot or represent anything more than vivid nightmares, Lynch provides a reflective, fragile meditation on the universal subjects of aging and family and finds reassurance in both. The simple true story of an Iowa farmer (Richard Farnsworth) who rides a lawn mower to Wisconsin to visit his estranged, stricken brother, there are still plenty of the unique and original visual dreamscapes (some rather striking aerial shots of the heartland, filmed by veteran cinematographer Freddy Francis) to make it an undeniable Lynch effort and characterizations that are some of his most unforgettable. Farnsworth is excellent in a stoic yet personable way, allowing the stories he hears on his journey to become a part of his life, and Sissy Spacek turns in some of her finest work in a smaller role as his mentally challenged yet observant daughter (whose painful secret is revealed in a poignant way through a gentle turn in the sensitive script by John Roach and Mary Sweeney) but the rest of the small cast to a person delivers indelible performances, one of the most notable being Barbara Robertson, whose accidental killing of a deer is both uproarious and sad at the same time. But that's vintage Lynch with his ability to engage and unsettle you at his best. To those unfamiliar with Lynch or know him only by his violent, disturbing reputation, this is an excellent place to begin; for those who know his work, this is one of the finest in his repertoire.",

            "content": "I have to confess something here. \"The Straight Story\" was the first David Lynch film that I did see and I would like to see it on the big screen again. At a time where people were saying \"American Beauty\" is a classic when it really is an overrated film. Sam Mendes maybe a good film director, but he's nothing like David Lynch or David Cronenberg.In \"The Straight Story\", the story starts out in the small town of Laurens, Iowa where Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth - \"Misery\", \"The Natural\") overhears his daughter, Rose (Sissy Spacek - \"Affliction\"), who finds out on the telephone that Alvin's brother, Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton - \"The Green Mile\") had a devastating stroke.A few seconds later, Alvin tells Rose that he needs to see Alvin before it's too late. However, there are a few obstacles that stands in Alvin's way. One, he's seventy-three years old. Two, his eyesight is so bad that he can't drive a car. Three, his hips are in terrible shape and getting up is hard enough. Despite that, he's determined to get to Mount Zion, Wisconsin, that's the town where Alvin lives nearby. The vehicle that Alvin chooses to use on the road is his Reds' lawnmower, is the surprise choice. When the lawnmower breaks down, Alvin buys a '66 John Deere lawnmower from Tom the John Deere dealer, nicely played by Everett McGill, who has a couple good lines.Alvin gets out on the road again and whoever he meets is very interesting to watch. The heart and soul of the film rests in Alvin's eyes. My personal favorites were the bickering twins, pregnant runaway, the deer woman, a former WWII vet, and the priest. The scene between the priest and Alvin is heartwarming and the line that Alvin makes is very clear.The last scene where Alvin arrives at Lyle's house is priceless and the conversation that Lyle and Alvin have is well written. Angelo Badlamenti conducts one of the best musical scores that I've heard and Freddie Francis' cinematography is wonderfully dune. Overall, the performance that Farnsworth should have earned him an Oscar for Best Actor and why he didn't get it is a disgrace. David Lynch, too, deserved an Oscar as well and the film should have gotten a Best Picture award. This film is the best one of 1999.",

A very deep story of humanity that we all can relate to. Very well acted all around, but extremely well acted by Richard Farnsworth as he received a well deserved Oscar Nomination for the lead in this film. I love the fact that David Lynch directed this film. Out of thousands of directors who love to make movies out of the bizarre and crazy, David Lynch is probably the only one who has had a successful and lucrative A- List Career at doing so. Lynch always has a specific style and story that he does which is usually a very odd and bizarre one which makes for a very odd and bizarre film. But The Straight Story is something completely different then anything Lynch has ever done. For one thing it's rated G, and it's a Disney Film. I don't think any of us Film Buffs would ever fathom we would be using Rated G, Disney Film and David Lynch in the same sentence in our lifetime. But The Straight Story truly shows what a gifted and talented director David Lynch is. It's just a shame Lynch doesn't go outside of his box more often. What I love about Steven Spielberg is about half the time you can tell it's a Spielberg film by the style of how it is made, but the other half of the time you can't tell Spielberg made the film. And I think sometimes a great director needs to switch it up from time to time and step outside their box and try new styles and stories, just try something different. So David Lynch tried a new style and something different with The Straight Story and it is absolutely a beautiful film. The cinematography is amazing, the pace is perfect for the story at hand, and that's all in thanks to the great directing job of Lynch. Very well edited as well, in thanks to Lynch as well as the other film editor/editors. A movie that one can watch over and over again. Also a film that can make one feel good about life and living again. Farnsworth delivers his lines with such simplicity, such humanity that they go deep in the viewers soul and the viewer will not soon forget certain lines that Farnsworth says in the film(as his character Alvin).

Once Farnsworth sets out on his journey, the movie becomes a rather murky variation on \"Harry & Tonto\", with the screenplay giving Alvin Straight no real dimension or interesting obstacles. Lynch seems to believe that dark, muddled bits of business will tell this story (the most enchanting moment comes early on, with Straight and his daughter watching a lightning storm from their window). Farnsworth got an Oscar nomination for his sterling work, and almost carries this film off single-handedly; Sissy Spacek has very little to work with as the daughter, but Harry Dean Stanton is moving in his moments at the finale. ** from ****",

But even being the fan that I was, and only ever being disappointed with one of his movies ('Dune' - a flawed, but still interesting failure), I was very dubious when I first heard about 'The Straight Story'. I thought it sounded like a Disney-fied sell-out, and yet another maverick being neutered by the mainstream. I shouldn't have worried. Fifteen minutes into the movie and I was convinced. The plot may not be full of Lynch's usual disturbing, surreal pessimistic outlook, but everything about it is vintage Lynch. Beautiful, haunting images, and a hereto unseen humanistic quality.\nRichard Farnsworth gives one of the most compelling performances you'll see in any movie.

No silly schmaltzy endings here, this is a movie about life and hardship and it'll leave you thinking a long time after you see it.",

The wonderful Richard Farnsworth, who was so awesome in \"The Grey Fox\" and \"The Natural\", stars as Alvin Straight, a kind-hearted gent who crosses America to visit his brother on a lawn mower. Beautifully written, directed and photographed (by the great Freddie Francis), it is a celebration of human kindness and life's unexpected joys. Angelo Badalamenti creates a gorgeous, touching score to mark Alvin's adventure and subtly underlines the film's purest of emotions. Sissy Spacek is, as usual, compelling as Alvin's daughter Rose, who is initially reluctant to encourage her father to take the trip. Jack Fisk, who production designed Lynch's \"Eraserhead\", returns here for another fine job. Though not a \"typical\" Lynch film, it is still Lynchian in its affectionate and authentic depiction of rural life.",

            "content": "What a truly and unabashedly serene road movie this is. Lynch, through his co-writer/wife's script, seems to understand how simple but not so simple life and the people living in rural areas can be. Veering on part Iowa-neorealist fable and in part a truly experimental feat for the filmmaker (eg how to match together the absurd yet sort of logically illogical comedy of everyday life with true whimsical overtones in visual style and choice in leading role), The Straight Story provides some measurable food for thought, however in little doses, and if there was ever a film that I might want to have playing right before I die- or even at my funeral, as some people have songs- it would be this.Rarely do actors get enough leverage out of playing kindly old people, but Farnsworth really digs down deep for something that is, actually, not too far from his real life (the aches and pains in just getting up from his lawnmower seat and walking around were truer than just in portraying Straight, as Farnsworth had early-stage bone cancer during filming) . Though aside from physical presence, Farnsworth makes an easy role not so easy. Beneath Straight's stubborn, well-mannered but no BS-in exterior, there's some demons he carries, mostly from WW2, and a life lived via good times and very bad times in the history of his family shows always on his face and his fragile eyes. It's an extraordinary turn, and it's one of those career-capping performances that many actors only wish they could achieve let alone a veteran stuntman turned character actor like Farnsworth.And as for Lynch, he takes a few playfully wicked stabs at the rural life he's portraying, though playful the key word; spouts of dramatic conflict and comedy come in the forms of a whole fleet of bicyclists riding on the other side of the road, or a woman who's hit one too many deer, or when he just has to get out of the rain- albeit there's one shot, one of the very best I've seen in a Lynch film, as Straight stars his journey and we see it from a perspective of the road as an uproarious in-joke to Lost Highway. Many crane shots and sweeping views of fields and tracking shots of the man on his mower are splendid, but it's this contrasted with how intimately portrayed the human interactions are, on levels of the goodness and occasional slow-ness of small-town folk, that scores Lynch his richest points.Although the film does end on a note that's satisfactory only in the sense that it leaves it on a \"well, we made it, that's what counts\" kind of level, and that it's far from being Badalamenti's best musical score overall (some of it feels like it should accompany a Quaker Oats commercial, which maybe is the point), it remains a small but succinct triumph of the aging human spirit, where the light side of Americana still has its quirks via the Lynch universe, and abstraction blends into naturalism with the greatest of ease.",

(As proof, in the middle of writing that sentence I went off to check a website before returning.) And yet somehow, for The Straight Story -- two hours of a guy riding a lawn mower and encountering mild small town events along the way -- captivated me completely. Weird, huh? It gets weirder when you consider the guy at the helm is David Lynch, known for producing very strange surrealist films. Sure, there are some Lynchian themes and moments here -- the loving aerial shots of agricultural industry, the fascination with small town American, the woman who keeps hitting deer who seems to have wandered out of Twin Peaks -- but at root this is a naturalist film with a conventional, almost sentimental story arc.But I think this is what gives the movie its charm -- it settles for smallness and modesty, and maybe even presents that as glorious. After all, Alvin Straight's story is not so fantastic -- a journey only from state to state, suitable for the \"Weird News\" section but not a biopic. And yet there's a beauty to a lifetime of small moments, minor triumphs and tragedies, and The Straight Story really conveys them. More than anything this is a movie of age and survival, and of managing to bear strife with a smile.Which makes it sound a bit like a Hallmark movie but really, it's good. Don't be fooled by the boring description and box art -- this is a film worth seeing.",

I wouldn't think that resume would put him at the top of the list for a Disney movie.  The Straight Story is about a 74 year old man who upon learning that his brother who he hadn't spoken to in years, had been stricken with a stroke travels 400 miles to see him. Because he doesn't have a drivers license he sets out on his riding lawn mower.The film is packed with beautiful scenery of Iowa and stellar performances by Sissy Spacek and Richard Farnsworth who was nominated for an Ocsar for his performance as Allen Straight. That along with Lynch's direction, a wonder score by Angelo Badalamenti, and a heart-warming script sends not only Allen Straight on an emotion journey, but the viewer as well. The film is about family and the strength there of.  You may want to call a loved one after you see The Straight Story so keep the phone and a box of tissues close.

This movie came out when I was in Britain, and nearly every critic there was falling over themselves with praise for it- a mystery to me when it seemed like such a dull, Disneyfied yawner ( I didn't know at the time that it was a David Lynch film). When I got back to America, I thought it would be the same story, but instead, hardly anyone here was talking about it. Typical of us Yanks to pass off as boring, sappy shlock what is in fact one of the greatest commentaries in recent times on human existence and, ironically, the American psyche. I don't mean to make it sound like this is some overly intellectual, artsy-fartsy lecture film, as some of Lynch's other works have threatened to be. Just about anyone could find something here that will stay with them if they are open to it. Intellectual value aside, \"The Straight Story\" is at least a gentle, beautiful, inspiring tale of one man taking the rare initiative, in the form of a journey, to right the wrong in his life rather than simply accept it, complain about it or run from it. Along the way of this journey, we are literally assaulted with compelling, emotional imagery, most notably Angelo Badelamenti's heart-wrenchingly gorgeous score, which provides the perfect backdrop to the rolling poetry that isthe American midwest when portrayed in this light. I'm not sure how he did it, but I'm sure only a director like David Lynch could take such ordinary-seeming people and settings and transform them into fascinating characters, drawing you further and further in and investing you in them more than you thought you ever would. It takes a hard heart indeed to deny the arresting, humbling honesty of this film.",

There is humour here but it's quiet and unforced, not loud and brash.This film is really the antithesis of the modern Hollywood film. There's no action, no character arcs, no big plot developments. Just a quiet sense of place and time and, most importantly of all, humanity.

            "content": "Wow, I remember reading about this guy when Alvin Straight was undergoing his lawn mower odyssey but I didn't know a movie was made about it. I don't think the film put the date in context, it occurred in 1994 and the picture came out five years later. The thing that surprised me was when the story revealed that Straight was seventy three years old. Richard Farnsworth was made up to look about ninety even though he was within a year of Straight's actual age when he made the picture. The only thing that might have looked older was that first tractor he started out with, looking like a relic from his World War II days at least.What I liked about the character was the way he applied his homespun wisdom to onlookers and fellow travelers, like the five month pregnant girl who took his advice to return to her family with that 'sticks in a bundle' story. Or how about his response to one of the men at the cyclers' camp - \"Well, the worst part about bein' old is rememberin' when you were young\". Actually, I don't think the man might have meant that, even with his failing eyesight and two cane support. After a life of trial and tribulation, Mr. Alvin appeared to be a man who had his head on straight, and I say that with no pun intended. What was perfect I thought was the very ending when he was finally able to come to terms with his brother. Both men appeared to reconcile their past differences without virtually saying a word, realizing that any arguments between them were rendered meaningless in the grand scheme of things. I was intrigued enough about this story to look up up the real Alvin Straight and as I'm now accustomed to, there were a few changes in his story that was brought to the big screen. The chronology of events depicted in the picture differ somewhat from the way they occurred, and try as I might, I can't figure out why the name of Alvin's brother was changed from Henry to Lyle in the story. And lest anyone is wondering, Alvin made it safely back to Laurens, Iowa from Blue River, Wisconsin by virtue of a nephew who picked him up and drove him home. You really can't fault the man for making the lawn mower trip a one way affair.",

            "content": "It's the mark of a good director who continually succeeds in producing films that are discussed, analysed, awarded and often puzzled over. Such is the case with the more well-known Eraserhead, Lost Highway, Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive, all directed by David Lynch.This film could not be more different. Instead of complexity, there is simplicity; instead of delving into the depths of human depravity, this one soars to the stars as two men try to come to an understanding; instead of moral nihilism and isolation, there is affirmation of the very human need to communicate with one another as we all partake of life's journey.Other directors would \u0096 or could -- have turned this film into a tearjerker. In the hands of Lynch, however, this is a straight story, told simply, a short episodic road movie with a difference: in this case, the true story of an old man who uses a ride-on lawn mower to drive hundreds of miles to see his sick brother. There are none of Lynch's usual techniques of flash forwards or backwards, out of sync scenes, dark corridors or rooms, discordant music or long, inexplicable silences or looks.This is a movie you should see, and I don't say that lightly, because there are four scenes that stand out. The first is when old Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) stops for the night and is joined by a girl hitchhiker; during the course of their conversation, Alvin deftly shows her the error of her ways. A second scene is when Alvin pauses to listen to a frenetic woman (Barbara Robertson) who's just smashed into a deer on the road and killed it; Alvin's face is a study as she rants and raves about always hitting deers on that road, a road she must use every day. A third, and very powerful one, is when Alvin has a beer, for the first time in many years, and recounts a traumatic war experience with another veteran; Farnsworth was always a good actor, but here, he just shines. The final scene is when Alvin meets his estranged brother, Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton \u0096 in what must be Stanton's shortest film appearance), and the camera stays on the latter most of the time, as Alvin advances. Hardly a word is spoken, as Stanton's facial expressions do most of the 'talking', from rejection to puzzlement to final acceptance.The supporting cast is uniformly down-to-earth and low-key, as befitting a story set in rural America, and the camera lovingly takes in the beauty of nature without overdoing it, too. Farnsworth carries the movie, of course, and it's a shame he didn't get many awards for it; it was arguably his finest performance before his tragic death in 2000.",

Just good nature decent folk, despite Alvin's affection for cigars and Rose's awkward speech impediment. And neither play up or down their character to be a saintly old man, or a freakish misunderstood daughter. But when some of their backstories are revealed, one's heart can't help from going out to them. Then there's the scenery captured along Alvin's slow trek. Just stunning images that look like paintings come to life. Like Norman Rockwell, but yet continuously modern. The movie is a as fresh today as it was near 25 years ago! And I'd say it's best factor is it's quirky simplicity. Being directed by David Lynch, one never knows what to expect. But he's above 'genuine' in pulling off this film. A couple of odd moments and/or characters are encountered along the way. But no one or nothing 'stands out' as with Lynch's other films. They're just events that Alvin and the viewer hardly get to witness, and aren't that unusual when understood. And the towns people and citizens Alvin encounters along the way are realistic and relatable. Some are 'characters' in their manner, some are comically frustrated, and most are just plain decent. And nothing is drawn to any of them to say 'Here comes the crazy neighbour again...' or 'I bet that woman gets good and drunk when she gets home'. Just simply people trying to get through their day and/or their lives as best they can regardless of the circumstances they have or may be facing. And all totally endearing and forgivable. I hate to use the cliche term 'life affirming' - but I got to say The Straight Story is just that!

A movie whose narrative structure was straightforward and simple. Although, there's more to The Straight Story than there at first appears. On the one hand it's a tale of the true story of Alvin Straight who travelled hundreds of miles on a lawnmower to visit his ill brother; while on the other hand, it's a reflection on growing old. This latter part is emphasised in the encounters that Alvin has as he progresses along the way. The life-cycle is represented as he first meets a pregnant girl, then some cyclists in the flush of youth, next a middle-aged family, he then has an emotional encounter with a man the same age as him who also has similar tragic experiences and finally there is a night-time scene with a vicar in cemetery where the spectre of death and the possible afterlife is spoken of. So this deceptively simple tale is structured in such a way that it explores a lot more than immediately meets the eye.It's been said many times before but should really be said again that Richard Farnsworth is outstanding in the central role of Alvin. His performance is a master-class in subtle brilliance and must be one of the very rare occasions where an actor delivers the peak example of their skills at so an advanced an age. Cinematographer Freddie Francis photographs the wide expanses of the Midwest quite beautifully, while Angelo Badalamenti accompanies these visuals with a lovely warm soundtrack. Lynch himself, reigns in his usual directorial impulses to remain true to the material. There are still some Lynchian moments such as the encounter with the Deer Woman and some of the quirkier humour such as the grabber scene. But these parts fit in seamlessly to the whole, and in any case, Lynch has often shown a sweet side in even his darkest films, such as Blue Velvet; it's just that here with the sinister element entirely removed it seems so unusual.The Straight Story is really a magnificent film to be perfectly honest. It shows that it is entirely possible to make U certificate films for adults. It pulls off the very rare thing of having a film with no villainous characters at all, while remaining completely compelling throughout. It shows that sometimes by stripping a story down to its basic components and focusing entirely on good people it's possible to produce something that's outstanding and unpredictable. It shows that by slowing down to the speed of a lawnmower you can see details you might otherwise have missed. What David Lynch pulled off here is something quite incredible.",

It takes guts to make a film this in an age where everyone in Hollywood thinks the average attention span of a viewer is five minutes, tops.  The camera uses extremely long, unbroken shots, rather than fast cutting from scene-to-scene and a quiet, slow paced script.  The film follows the trail of Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth), the seventy-three-year-old father of a middle-aged slightly mentally disabled daughter, Rose(Sissy Spacek).  Straight sets off across Iowa in a lawn tractor pulling a trailer to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin, to visit his estranged brother, before it's too late.  Along the way Alvin encounters bickering twin mechanics, a runaway pregnant teenager, a catholic priest, and several other genuine and sincere characters.  The story is sad, but makes you happy as well.  It's not a good film for someone without a long attention, though, but if you're that someone, give the film a chance.  It means a lot of things in this hectic, fast-paced, obnoxious world.",

            "content": "\"The Straight Story\" is based on Alvin Straight who, at the age of 73 and in ill-health, made the 265-mile trip from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisc. on a John Deere riding mower, albiet with the need for repairs along the way. It took him 5 weeks to make the first 200 miles! Along the way he encountered some interesting people that produced some heartwarming dialog. The meeting of the two brothers after 10 years' of not speaking is a fine finale. Farnsworth as Straight does such a remarkable job that he really \"becomes\" Straight. But, how do you place a film like this among other films based on \"a real story?\" Films that come to mind are \"Nixon\", \"Longitude\", \"Music of the Heart\", \"Apollo 13\", \"Man on the Moon\", just to name a few. To me, all of these films are wonderful, and also are much more significant, are better-filmed, and are overall more enjoyable to watch.Currently \"Straight Story\" is rated #78 on the IMdb all-time list, ahead of such favorites as \"The Graduate(67)\", \"October Sky(99)\", \"Forrest Gump(94)\", Dead Man Walking(95), \"Back to the Future(85)\", \"Bonny and Clyde(67)\", and \"E.T.(82)\", to name a few. I don't believe it belongs there.I rate \"The Straight Story\" as a very high 7, or a low 8, on a 1 to 10 scale. It is a good film, but has been over-hyped to a considerable extent.",

Instead, the entire audience just sits very still and reads every single credit. That's \"The Straight Story.\"After several years of being lost in the wilderness (or maybe lost on the highway), director David Lynch has come back with a vengeance. This is his most powerful movie since \"The Elephant Man\" and if there is any justice in this world it will earn him his third Oscar nomination for Best Director.As someone who was born in Iowa and now currently lives in Wisconsin, I was amazed at how well Lynch captured this area of the country. I knew the roads that Alvin Straight was traveling and I knew the people he met along the way. Some might call Alvin's (and Lynch's) trip overly-sentimental, but maybe we're just not used to positive movies bringing us positive messages these days.And while the Academy is considering Mr. Lynch for an Oscar nomination, I hope they also consider the performances of Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek and the music of Angelo Badalamenti. And I certainly hope they will be able to consider a G-rated Disney flick for Best Picture as well.David Lynch, welcome back. Where have you been?",

            "content": "The Straight Story directed by David Lynchis based on the true story of Alvin Straight, who in 1994 drove a lawn mower more than 300 miles from Iowa to Wisconsin to visit his sick brother. Both brothers are aged and in poor health. They haven't spoken to each other in 10 years due to an angry spat involving \"alcohol\" and \"pride\". But after brother Lyle suffers a stroke, Alvin decides it's time to swallow his pride and connect again with his brother, recalling how close and supportive their relationship used to be long ago. Alvin is determined, in a stubborn Midwestern cowboy manner, to make the trip independently on his own. But as his eyesight is bad and he's got no driver's license, and very little pension income, the only plan is the lawn mower, towing a makeshift trailer for his camp. The trip takes more than five weeks of slow going, with a few misadventures along the way. He also has a string of opportunities to dispense a basic earthy yet pithily eloquent wisdom to everyone he meets along the way.But excitement and danger are not part of Lynch's interest here. The plot is quiet, the pace slow, and the genuine suspense is built from a deep yet common situation: longing to reconnect with family members. What strikes me about this film is that we do experience it as slow and quiet, yet simultaneously as absorbing and suspenseful. We are really with Alvin all the way, and for him. Every reviewer has remarked the surprise of a David Lynch film that seems the opposite of his trademark style: rather than disturbing pathology beneath the fake veneer of American small town life, we have here a very different perspective: an almost sentimental appreciation of small town community: the fellow concern, neighborly intimacy, family closeness, the peaceful streets, etc. These are fully evoked and nowhere satirized, a real shock coming from Lynch's former postmodernist terror films in the same settings. \"Straight\" here is a pun on the man's name, and also on the narrative sensibility: without irony, a simple chronology, one good protagonist, and only universal mortality and individual shortcomings as the real antagonist. The miracle of this film is that this all works well as a film per se. It is a remarkable achievement. Lynch does have his old tongue in his cheek when overtly alluding to his former dark style, especially in the opening scene before we meet Alvin but only hear a mysterious thump to the tune of foreboding dissonant chords. But this allusion is a conscious ploy to remind us that Lynch could have gone there again, but he doesn't. The thump quickly turns out to be merely Alvin's fall on the floor as his cane slipped. The characters who find him on the floor are meant as a parody of the former Lynch audience expectations: terror. But this is all lightheartedly dispelled, and we are launched into a new perspective from there-- the straight story, based on a real-life heartwarming human interest piece. The film might illustrate a deeper point about postmodernism: it's not about \"style\" and narrative sophistication, but rather about what Nietzsche called \"perspectivism\". The deep feeling about simple values and family connections here is another perspective, just as perfectly valid in this vision as the darker perspective that made Lynch infamous.",

Well then I visited the movie's page here on IMDb and I read the comments of those who hated the movie. Among the adjectives which were used to describe the movie were \"bizarre,terrible,pathetic,sick etc...\" This could have been a long shot end to my Lynch odyssey but I decided to see another movie by him and it happened to be \"The Straight Story\". I love simple sweet stories and that was such a story.The veteran actor Richard Farnsworth plays an old man-Alvin Straight-who can't walk and see properly.Alvin is really an unyielding man who does not give in to the wishes of her adult daughter that he should undergo a strict treatment. Alvin lives with this adult daughter of his and she seems to be only family member around. One day Alvin hears that his estranged brother has had a stroke then makes up his mind to go visit him and hopefully make up for the ten years they have not talked to each other.Because he has no driving license, he can barely walk and he has a poor sight he hitches a trailer to his 30-year-old riding lawnmower and sets off on the 300-mile journey from Laurens, Iowa to Mount Zion, Wisconsin. He meets different people on the road. He listens to their stories and he tells about the small private details of his own life. That's such a nice road story. It does not give you the whole details but it's up to you to add up the whole from the little pieces scattered. I do not really think that the veteran actor Richard Farnsworth acts in this movie he seems to be really experiencing the ambiance of the celluloid.The fact that \"he was terminally ill with cancer during the shooting of the film\" confirms my observation,I believe. It's so sad to learn that he committed suicide the following year, at age 80. I wish he had got the Academy award because I believe it was not enough to be the oldest person ever to be nominated for an Oscar for this performance.Just like I said this was my first Lynch movie but I'm glad he made a movie at least this one by leaving aside the disturbing,bizarre imagery and horrid themes.",

This film is basically the antithesis of David Lynch's other movies which are often gloomy, surreal and uneasy. Still, there are a few typical David Lynch trademarks in this film. The characters are very eclectic and developed in a detailed manner. The camera techniques are calm and smooth. The movie's pace is slow and I would even describe it as peaceful.One thing that stands out is the acting of Richard Farnsworth. It doesn't feel like he is playing a character. It feels like he is just being himself: a stubborn, thoughtful and wise old man who wants to do things his way. This character is very likable which helps viewers caring for or even identifying with the character. Even the side characters are very profound and sympathetic. The main character only meets friendly people along the road that help him out when he is running out of money, looking for shelter or having an accident. I thought that the conversation with a young female runaway about family values around a campfire and the conversation between two war veterans in a bar were absolute emotional highlights of this film. Scenes like these offer a lot of food for thought and may make more sensitive viewers cry because they are so beautiful. The dialogues add a lot to this since they are written with great care. The main character doesn't speak much but when he does so, he always has something meaningful to say. Since the movie is based upon true events, it even feels more authentic and could be situated somewhere between a drama and documentary.The movie has a very philosophical side without ever being pretentious. Recurring topics are the beauty of nature, coping with loss and sadness, dealing with painful memories, the downsides of getting old, the meaning of life, optimism and perseverance in difficult circumstances and the values of family and friendship. While younger audiences might find this movie too smooth, it has so much depth and talks about what life really is about. I would suggest any teenager or young adult to experience this film with an open mind and to think about the real essence of life beyond money, popularity and wealth.David Lynch once said that ''The Straight Story'' might be his most experimental film and this is definitely the case. It's an emotional, meaningful and wise movie where sensitive scriptwriters, an imaginative director and gifted actors joined forces to create a truly beautiful gem that should be more popular than it is.",

One day he gets a phone call from a hospital informing him that his 75-year-old brother Lyle (Alien's Harry Dean Stanton) has suffered a stroke. He decides to go to him in Wisconsin to settle their differences, but because he does not have a driver's licence, the only transport he has to get him there is his lawn mower. So he begins his journey that will take hundreds of miles, even if it is the last thing he will ever do. Along the way he obviously greeted by some friendly and helpful people who are fascinated by what he is doing, and does make it in the end to sit with Lyle on the porch and look at the stars. Farnsworth is a good lead actor, Spacek gets a few scenes that make her stand out, and the aerial shots of the places the mower travels are good viewing.

The music by Angelo Badalementino was perfect -- not overstated, did not insult us by trying to make us feel any particular emotion. After I saw \"Disney Studios\" I was astounded to then read \"David Lynch.\" But there was none of the usual Disney-kid-stuff in this film. It was signature Lynch all the way. The bizarre conversations, the (may be spoiler) scene on the road with the woman and the dead deer (reminiscent of a scene from \"Wild at Heart\"), the little nuggets of truth and beauty in snippets of dialogue. The opening shot with the lines of corn going first one direction, then another, followed by a honest-to-god Lynch small town.... And the interesting thing was the overwhelming number of old men. Lynch is, as of this date, only 65, so his observations about growing old are perhaps premature (though he has an extraordinary mind, certainly capable of leaps of intuitive comprehension). I must have ordered this film because it was David Lynch, but I honestly don't remember since it was on my list for so long. A terrific screenplay and superb directing. I was deeply moved when I wasn't chuckling inside; this brought tears more than once, and I am a pretty tough nut. This film is too slow for many viewers; but to me it was perfectly paced. Slow and mostly steady -- just like Alvin's trip with the 1966 John Deere mower. Without giving it too much thought, I'd say it was meant to be taking place in the 80's.

In that sense it's a typical Lynch film, his trademarks are visible and it would be wrong to say, just because of the lack of violence and because there isn't that in-your-face weirdness were used to from his other films, that this film could have been directed by anyone.So Alvin Straight starts his journey, driving through the countryside meeting other people, some who are lost and some who give him shelter. With his good-hearted nature he eventually makes it to his brother and we finally understand why he refused to be taken there: He made that difficult journey to show his brother that he was important enough for him to make that difficult task. There's no final emotional conversation that resolves their troubled relationship. Just a nod to that old John Deere lawnmower is enough.",

He's too old to legally and drive and doesn't have the money to pay for travel. The trip of only a matter of states will take him almost a year by mower, and he will meet a myriad of characters along the way.Lynch's absurd and dark humor works gently here, but still rears it's head at the right moments (the woman who always hit's deer). Still though, it's worlds away from Eraser Head and Blue Velvet, but feels like an artist expanding his horizons, than trying to make a \"traditional film\". The movie has a unique perspective and natural beauty and earnestness, that's stirring and never sappy. It's a straight forward, emotionally engaging movie about the absurd, miraculous, and honest in life. Beautiful",

Although very slow at first and although never actually any faster, the movie grabbed me because Lynch simply found a way to make it interesting. Alvin Straight becomes more and more deep a character as the movie unwinds and as it does so do the teary eyes. This script is marvelous if you want to simply feel the movie and the characters, and Richard Farnsworth, somebody I knew nothing about prior to watching the movie, seems like he's been doing these kind of pictures for years. He just shines, period. The ending was a little confusing at first, but now somehow it just makes sense. The bundle had to be repaired, that's all. Simple, straight, life enriching. 8/10",

            "content": "The Straight Story is quite a departure for David Lynch; a man who has made a name for himself for his strange and surreal movies. It is, however, an unwelcome departure as although this movie isn't bad, it's hardly up to the high standard that we're used to from a man that has brought us such classics as 'The Elephant Man' and 'Blue Velvet'. The movie follows the story of Archie Straight; a man that doesn't have a drivers licence, doesn't like other people driving and has a sick brother that lives a long way away. So, he decides that he'll make the journey, on his lawn mower. Sounds boring? You bet, but it's not actually as boring as it could have been. Richard Farnsworth stars in the lead role, and is believable as the old man that wants to see his brother, but it's hard to say that his performance is good - simply because it doesn't require any talent to play. Archie is a typical old man, and since Farnsworth is also an old man; it's simply an old man playing an old man. The rest of the cast isn't really in it enough to make a fair judgment on, and the only other real star is Sissy Spacek. Spacek has proved that she can act with films like Carrie and In The Bedroom, but if you had only seen her here, you'd be forgiven for thinking that she couldn't. She spends the film talking. very. slowly. like. this. and although, obviously, the character needed to be played like that since it's based on a true story, it's hard to call her performance 'good'.The Straight Story is very similar in nature to classic Bergman film; Wild Strawberries, in that it's about an old man taking a road trip, and coming to terms with his age and giving advice to younger people. This idea of getting old was also explored to an extremely high standard in 2002's underground hit - Bubba Ho-Tep. Here, however, the message is lost under masses and masses of fake sentimentality, of which the movie is soaked in. It simply doesn't always work, and Lynch would have been much better served by laying off the sentiment and packing in the more important things - like story. That being said, the movie does have its moments where the sentiment does work and these moments are definitely good; but they're few and far between. There is also some important life lessons in the movie, but like the sentiment; it's few and far between. The movie also uses a fade to black editing technique, which gets irritating very quickly.Overall, The Straight Story is a decent film with a decent lead performance; but that's all. Despite the fact that it's not bad, I would have a hard time recommending the movie to anyone. Although it has it's moments, there simply isn't enough of them and that makes it hard to recommend, and therefore hard to recommend not watching either Wild Strawberries or Bubba Ho-Tep instead. So yes, if I was you; I'd see one of those two movies and leave this one.",

But because Lynch made it the film predictably gets overpraised, as is the case with most of his post-\"Elephant Man\" movies. (It's so very easy for critics to rate this yawner highly when they don't have to sit through it; they simply know who directed it and immediately have an opinion.) Lynch basically directs the camera at the main character but nothing happens. If he'd even picked his nose once it'd have been an event! This lack of activity is in the vast majority of the scenes, while soppy, clich\u00e9 Hollywood music doodles in the background - and this pathetic and highly unoriginal combination of sad-old-man and soppy-little-ditties is supposed to make the viewer fall into uncontrollable weeping frenzies.

No shelter anywhere. Then he glances over and sees a small barn. Heading towards it he parks inside at the moment the Heavens open. Safe and protected from the force of nature. It is such a simple moment but is executed so well. The pace of the film is wonderful and quite frankly I could watch Farnsworth for hours as he has that kind of face.

There performances were subtle, powerful and beautiful. In a word! Brilliant!...  What is more, BELIEVE ABLE...never once did I doubt them or lose touch with their characters.  Sissy Spacek was totally overlooked by the Academy...she is I believe along with Holly Hunter, Judi Dench & Joan Plowright probably the greatest actress alive.  I have never been a big fan of David Lynch, but what ever his detractors might say about him , he cannot be convicted of not knowing how to portray people sensitively, one must just look at Elephant Man to know he does \"sensitive\" and \"personal\" with the best of them.  He certainly did that here.  I also liked in this film a little nuance of his, that when the camera was a few yards away from the subject the sound went down....forcing one to listen carefully to the dialog....much like it would be if you were actually standing 30 or 40 feet from someone trying to hear what they were saying. I have long ago lost faith in the Academy, but It should be criminally prosecutable to have compared the acting in this film, that is to say, the acting of Farnsworth with that of Kevin Spacey in American Beauty.  Those who awarded and voted for Kevin should be sentenced to the chain Gang, Long Sentences with water and dried bread.  THIS FILM SHOULD BE  A 10 on anyones story board.  And an 11 in the heart.  Oh Yes, and I have never seen a better ending  to a film like this...nor a better choice as the leads brother than Harry Dean Stanton. David Lynch proves and sees with a clear eye that \"less is more\" it is a magnificent Ending....Perfect....Flawless BEAUTIFUL! Hey!

            "content": "David Lynch is commonly known for making surreal, twisted and ill-minded pictures in which reality often appears as a frightening place. The story usually begins regularly but then, out of the blue, gets nightmare-like elements of disgust and anxiety. However, The Straight Story is a whole new ballgame. It's the opposite to everything Lynch has ever made but still, paradoxically, attains to keep his unique cinematic style together. As an unusual Lynch film, The Straight Story is a slow and tender road-movie about an old man who decides to travel a long journey by a lawn mower to see an ill brother of his. At its heart, the film is a straight story about real life, which might still exist somewhere; life where people are nice to each other and don't only think of their own benefit; life where solidarity is no longer vanishing folklore. Due to this, the film even seems quite mythological -- for better and worse. Moreover, the film highlights the importance of family, friends and love, as well as wisdom and righteousness. To some, all this might sound a bit foolish and artificially cheery but, conversely, a director like Lynch achieves to create an actual presence of calm rest. The monotonous procrastination of the events is only there to tame the wildest viewer of modern hectic cinema. Even as being a total exception in Lynch's production, this atmospheric road-movie does still have many typical elements for the director too. Such as the significance of sounds and visuals; even at their most hypnotic. Furthermore, the emotional poetry of the film associates it with The Elephant Man (1980). Besides, and most importantly, there still is the Lynchian absurdity; only this time, it can be seen in the hectic hurry inside and the irrationality of modern life. Although The Straight Story doesn't reach on the level of Lynch's masterworks, it is, nonetheless, touching in all its authenticity and modest sincerity. At times, its sentimentality leads to idealistic interpretation but, however the old man's stubbornness, and the honesty of the story, balance it. In conclusion, The Straight Story tells about life with its ups and downs. Beneath the surface one doesn't find horror, as usual, but beauty. On the other hand, the story about an absurd adventure on a lawn mower -- through the South regions -- can also be seen as an ironic comment on the concept of mythical America. In any case, and above all, The Straight Story is a meditative and highly personal journey into the clarity of what is important in life.",

But it is a very straight story as the title might hint. Don't except to be caught in the usual Lynchian void of incomprehensibility that usually occurs after viewing i.e. Lost Highway. It is a simple film but it is indeed a great film. That is both from a innovative and an entertaining aspect. It's innovative because it so not Lynch. But maybe that IS Lynch. He likes to twist our minds and therefore puts together a film that might seem very mainstream and far from Lynch himself. Being a very avantgarde director, he might just make a film like this just to tease his regular audience because he knows what they expect but he doesn't give it to them. That would be crafty.The pace of the film is slow. I would almost say lawn mower speed... Don't expect an action orgy, but the film is truly entertaining for the ones who go with the flow of the film.  Look carefully for those small details that Lynch plot throughout the movie for our entertainment. Look for the great cinematography that makes this film come to life. And listen to Badalamenti's score and the main theme that really animates the Iowa and Wisconsin landscapes shown frequently. Farnsworth puts in one of his best performances in this film, making him one of the most likeable ol' men ever depicted on film. He doesn't have to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts. His cheerfulness just shines right through him and his acting earned him an Oscar nomination. Need I say that his weak health in this film wasn't acted? He was diagnosed with cancer and shot himself right after this film was complete. That knowledge just puts more emphasis on the film because it becomes more of a homage to Farnsworth. All of the above form a very nice motion picture that is suitable for all kinds of people that like a film the way they are supposed to be done. One could ask for homilies that aren't that obvious and a bit naive but it doesn't ruin the overall picture, being that it is a memorable motion picture. 9/10.",

Yes, I do think that it's that bad. Don't get me wrong, I love simple movies well-told. In fact, that's one of the golden rules in cinema, in my opinion, keeping it simple. However, \"The Straight Story\" is way too simple. This \"movie\" has a very dull and boring storyline, standard to terrible acting, and a predictable cliched soundtrack. The plot is, a man rides a lawnmower across the country to visit his sick and dying brother. Oops, I just spoiled the \"film\"! No, really, that's the whole \"movie\". All right, let me just say this right off the bat. The idea of going through such an extremely monotonous task just to visit a family member is a very charming gesture. But, the story needed more than that to have some resemblance of an impact. Even though he does reach his brother, the payoff is not as satisfying as it should've been. The whole \"film\" began with nothing and ended with nothing. It's almost on the level of being as bad as \"Diner\" (1982)! Which is another \"movie\" where nothing happens. The only somewhat decent part of this \"film\" is the opening. That was the only part of the \"movie\" where I actually felt some resemblance of emotion. I thought: \"okay, if it keeps up this tension throughout, then it could work!\" But no, once he begins his journey, it all goes downhill really fast. Kind of like someone dumped a bucket of water off the top of a cliff. That's how fast the \"film\" goes downhill! As I mentioned, at least 80% of this \"movie\" is just a boring man riding a boring lawnmower on a road. They couldn't have shown any dangers or obstacles along the way? If they made the trip more difficult, then maybe it would have had a purpose! Believe it or not, this \"film\" is based on a true story. What kind of person in their right mind thought this concept would be entertaining? I'll tell you one thing, they must have very low standards for what they watch. I wouldn't green light a boring plot like this! There are so many interesting true stories out there, and this one somehow got made into a movie? Why?! As far as the acting goes, it's overall just as big a letdown as the story. The only passable performances come from the side characters. Some of the main cast do try. But, all of them are just mediocre with their performances. Even Richard Farnsworth, who plays the main character, Alvin Straight, couldn't save this \"film\". You can just see the boredom on his face whenever he's shown on the screen. Whenever you can tell that an actor or actress is bored, then you know it's a serious problem. The whole time, our main character looks bored out of his mind, which inevitably results in the audience being bored. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Angelo Badalamenti is overall a predictable and cliched mess. There are some good parts, but overall, the film score just sounds like it was rushed together at the last second. When you notice the edits, then you know something is wrong. In this case, Angelo Badalamenti's name should really be Angelo Bad! Now for the good elements in this \"movie\". Yes, there are actually a couple of redeeming qualities here in this \"film\". The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this \"movie\" a decent atmosphere. You cannot go wrong with the midwest! The other good thing is the special effects. All of them were well-done and still hold up to this day. Unfortunately, great sets/locations and special effects are no excuses for poor screenwriting and acting. \"The Straight Story\" is yet just another overrated and boring mess in the world of cinema. It's a shame, because the story really had serious potential to be so much more. David Lynch has directed much better movies than this. What happened here? When I saw that he directed it, I thought: \"oh, if he's directing it, then it should be in good hands.\" But, it just feels like another person had directed it. Honestly, unless you know he's the director, then you would never guess that he directed it. \"The Straight Story\" is just another jumbled mess of boredom. It's so bad, that I almost considered putting it on my top ten worst movies of all-time list! Another thing I want to say is, I'm sorry that this was Richard Farnsworth's last film. What a terrible movie to end his career with! He has acted well in other movies and shows. What's his excuse here? Here's a tragic story for you. About a year after this \"movie\" was released, Richard Farnsworth killed himself. Now, the reason he committed suicide was because he had terminal cancer. But I wonder, was it just the disease alone that caused him to kill himself? Maybe \"The Straight Story\" had something to do with his suicide! Hmmm..... Any way, I'm struggling to rate this \"film\" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Unless you live a life of never-ending excitement and need to watch a boring movie to level everything out, then stay away from this \"film\"! I'm just glad that I got this review over with and I never have to see this \"movie\" ever again. Another thing, \"professional\" critics like this \"film\", big shock. I don't know what kind of brain disease they have, hopefully it's not contagious! This \"movie\" just proves that all \"professional\" critics are suckers for simple boredom. They're all afraid to be honest with their movie reviews, but I'm not. If you watch this \"film\", you'll just be wasting 112 minutes of your life.",

The scene where he's sharing a glass of milk with a beer drinking war veteran (like himself) was one of the most moving moments I think I've seen on film. It should be required for anyone who blindly supports war as gung ho revenge. (hint: soldiers return from combat plagued by guilt and trauma that never go away.) Every word Farnsworth speaks is simple and eloquent and he never lets anyone get the best of him.  (Spoiler? I love the part where those 2 lawn mower repairmen twins were trying to swindle him and he turns it all around on them to remind them how important family is.) Truly one of the best American films in years as well as one of Lynch's best efforts, this is also a fine swan song to one of the most flawless natural actors since probably Spencer Tracy. As for one reviewer claiming Alvin's journey made no sense, watch it again and hear how he explains why he's doing it. It's to atone for the way he behaved in the past. All very easy to understand.",

The worst part of this film is the character played by Sissy Spacek. Maybe we are supposed to feel pity for her stammering, but it was so obnoxious that it brought my enjoyment of the film down a few notches.I had never heard of this story before, and I am quite certain it is embellished, but it is interesting just the same. Would it really take five weeks to get from Iowa to Wisconsin? I would think it would be more like five days. I appreciate that (allegedly) they filmed in the actual locations, too. Not that the area is very interesting, but authenticity is nice. I have driven highway 18 many times and know the territory.There is a running joke in the movie about Wisconsin being a party state. Having lived here thirty years, I will neither confirm nor deny that. I also appreciate the inclusion of a pair called the Olsen Twins.Those used to David Lynch's weirder films (pretty much everything else he has done) may be surprised by how normal this one is. The premise is sort of strange, but the characters are rather mundane. There is no surrealism here, or even a strange lighting, angle or sound. If there is any hint that this is a Lynch film, I missed it. But that does not mean it is not good... just not what fans might expect.",

In fact if i hadn\u00b4t bought the DVD, i probably wouldn\u00b4t have watched it, and i would ended up missing one of the most beautiful movies i ever made. David Lynch, working for Disney ?! The most politicaly correct movie company ever ?! The only comparison for this must be, if the Pope sudenly got chosen to be the next Dalai Lama !!! :-)Come on, someone must be kidding ! For a second i though i had bought the wrong DVD and i had bought a new Leslie Nielsen comedy instead. Well i couldn\u00b4t be more wrong, because this movie is all that i was never expecting it to be. THE STRAIGHT STORY, is one of those very rare movies that can\u00b4t be explained, it has to be felt. And so if you will like it or not, will depend mostly upon your view of life and how you feel about your own personal values.By now i\u00b4ve already seen this movie about 4 or 5 times since i bought it about a month ago and i can\u00b4t get enough of it. Each time i get sad, or tired i just put this one and get carried away by it one more time. Because let me tell you, if you like this movie, every time you start watching it, you just can\u00b4t stop untill you\u00b4ve finished. Mainly because of Richard Farnsworth. Even today i still have trouble in convincing myself that the Alvin Straight in this movie is \"nothing\" but an actor playing a character. Richard\u00b4s performance is probably the best i ever seen in my life, because we totaly forget that everything in the screen is not real. Simply brilliant. Words can not describe it, once again it\u00b4s something that has to be felt.And as if this wasn\u00b4t enough, there\u00b4s Sissy Spacek, playing one of the most touching and simple characters i ever saw. This woman also deserved a bunch of awards, in fact everyone on this film deserved to go home with plenty of prizes and recognitions. The final minutes with Harry Dean Stanton playing Alvin\u00b4s brother are simply breathtaking. Never so many things were said in so few lines of dialogue.If there\u00b4s a movie that proves how fake the Oscars are, this is it.Oh,and let\u00b4s not forgget about the magnificent soundtrack. Angelo Badalamenti, does a superior work here. Probably his best. This has to be one best soundtracks ever, not because it stays in your mind afterwards, but because it works like magic in the movie. Never intrusive, and totaly beautiful !Go see this movie. And if you think this is another soapy drama, forget it. Emotion here is not flashed right into your eyes all the time. It doesn\u00b4t show to yourself, it makes you also feel instead. And this is what makes this movie great. Not what it shows, but what we know is there. Go feel this movie. It\u00b4s that good. AMERICAN BEAUTY will be forgotten in time. This movie WON\u00b4T.It made me want to buy a lanmower ! When i get old, i want to be like Alvin.",

Only 1-2 such scenes are worth viewing for the character/acting quality.

Maybe because it's based on a true story, what gives it a special something, but mostly because it's well shot, with great sceneries, very good acting, and a this time interesting and gripping story. Richard Farnsworth did a great job playing his character, he just has the face and presence to play this role.

The story is simple: 73-year-old Alvin Straight makes a 500 km journey in a lawn mower to mend his relationship with his ill brother. During the way, he reflects about growing old, his life and his mistakes. The subtle way this is done is effective and gives the movie beauty, but the story is sometimes too slow, with nothing happening. The dialogs are good, sometimes quotable, even if once or twice I spotted obvious stories that could have been avoided. The characters are all very natural, and you believe them from the first minute you see them on the screen. They are all likable because they are normal people, but always hopeful and with a certain innocence and able to accept life. The ending is, too, very simple but it works extremely well leaving you touched and moved.The acting is very good. Richard Farnsworth gives a wonderful performance. His character, on paper, isn't very interesting, but he's able to give Alvin dramatic nuances. He creates a man that slowly accepts growing old, ignores his pride and goes in a journey to meet his brother. He is stubborn, with a simple but pure morality. He has an amazing delivery of his lines, slowly, realistically, showing his character's controlled emotions in a touching way. Sissy Spacek gives Rosie vulnerability and barely visible pain, never overacting. All the other cast members that make brief appearances do a good, even if not remarkable job, with good delivery of their lines.The direction is brilliant. Lynch fills the movie with gorgeous shots and camera angles, that allow you not only to see the meaning of the screenplay and the great work by the actors', but you can see the beautiful roads and vegetation all around. His shots are steady and reflective just the right style for this movie.The cinematography is very good, capturing the beauty of Lynch's wide shots and the faces in a clear way.

Performances are authentic and genuine all across the board with some touching moments that feel so emotionally raw for a \"G\" rated film. While it may be a David Lynch film and his stamp is certainly on it, the story feels straightforward and far from abstract as you might expect. However, that doesn't take away the deeply thought-provoking nature of the film.The story seems to explore old age and one old man's place in a world he has trouble seeing himself again. One who can't do the things he can anymore but wishes maybe certain things were different. We see a man coming to terms with who he is and what choices he's made in his life and while it feels soul searching, it never becomes pretentious or preachy. Lynch and the screenwriters manage to balance realism and emotional interpretation of the character's circumstances. Story and performances aside, \"The Straight Story\" is technically brilliant and beautifully constructed. Breathtaking landscape shots feel painted with the most saturated of colors while every close-ups capture character's emotion and response in a natural way.This is definitely a slower paced film which might turn the younger audience off. There are times when the pace can drag and become a little inpatient but once someone finishes the film, they'll want to see it again.

            "content": "David Lynch is one of America's strangest and most compelling directors, but in the 90's his film career was heading in an ugly direction. 1990's Wild at Heart and 1997's Lost Highway both had flashes of off-kilter Lynchian brilliance, but both also seemed rather cruel, soulless and calculated in their weirdness. It would seem that Lynch had lost much of his natural talent for gripping surrealism found in Blue Velvet and Eraserhead, and all of his humanism and compassion found in The Elephant Man. In comes The Straight Story, a shockingly simple and clean breath of fresh air in his career. While many Lynch fans were likely (and understandably) disappointed by the lack of bizarre, dark elements in this gentle, G-rated tale, The Straight Story represents everything I love about Lynch films - his artistry, his eye for oddball details, and his quiet sense of compassion. It also is far more Lynchian than many give it credit for. While there are very few menacing elements here, it still is an evocative, mythic story of a physical and spiritual journey - just played in a far quieter, mellower key than past Lynch efforts.Just about every element of The Straight Story comes together beautifully. Richard Farnsworth is incredible as Alvin Straight, a stubborn old man with years of experience and wisdom etched on his face. The dependably great Sissy Spacek is also wonderful in the unusual, touching role of Alvin's daughter. Angelo Badalamenti's music fits beautifully with the serene images of the Midwest that Alvin slowly crosses on his lawnmower - there are long scenes of nothing but music and scenery that are breathtaking. The Straight Story is, along with The Elephant Man, easily Lynch's most humanistic film. Convincing humanity is found in every corner of this movie - in Alvin's face, in the people he meets who all are carrying their own scars and fears, in the near-wordless but deeply moving final scene. The Straight Story is heartbreaking and tender - an enormously emotional movie that never even verges on melodrama or unearned sentiment. While I do appreciate David Lynch's rare gift for twisted surrealism, I think his gift for expressing deeply-felt emotion is even rarer and more valuable. Films as mature and heartfelt as The Straight Story are few and far between. It quietly snuck up on me and became one of my favorite movies.",

The story moves along as slowly as the riding mower, but somehow manages to keep the viewer watching, waiting for the next life lesson Alvin's going to offer.Stretch out on the couch, relax and enjoy. It's the only way to watch this very good movie, which rates a 7/10 in my book.",

That's both a long setnece to start this review, but also a fairly full description of the entire film. David Lynch might have been thought of as an unlikely director of such a work; he's always liked to present a mythic version of small-town U. S. A., but normally with a dark underbelly which here is absent. But he gets the tone right, playing it straight (there really is no other way of putting it), and capturing both a grizzled humanity and a vanishing way of life.",

            "content": "With The Straight Story, Lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that I love. This film felt like a \"blind date\" gone bad. The Straight Story showed up, David Lynch arrived, but the rest of the date felt muddled, confusing, and utterly disastrous. Everything in this film seemed wrong. Lynch's choice for lead actor, the bland Sissy Spacek, the filler of repeat cornfield montages, all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read, I just felt that nobody had control over this picture, yet the randomness (and the possible tear ending) gave critics something to smile about. This is not a David Lynch film, and for those walking into this with images of Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, or even Eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated. The Straight Story attempted to show us a slice of Americana via the cornfields of Iowa, but for this boy based in the Flatlands of Illinois, it just seemed repetitive and boring.What initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that Lynch used to introduce us to Alvin and his daughter Rose. Alvin lying on the ground because he can't get up, the clich\u00e9 use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating, while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame. Spacek's depiction of Rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale. She brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes. I expected so much more from Spacek with her timeline of cinema, but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors. Then, to add more fuel to the fire, there was Richard Farnsworth. Again, he isn't a horrible actor, but it felt like Lynch picked him because he fit the role physically, but alas, couldn't master it mentally. Farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time on screen. I couldn't tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character. His eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes, and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending. His entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic, while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime, I saw it as babble (and no, I am not that insensitive \u0096 I just felt it could have been handled by a stronger, more professional actor). The rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant. I wanted Lynch to either go 100% for this film or none at all, but alas, it felt as if he just half-ed his way through this heap.Speaking of David Lynch, where did he go in this film? There were some scenes that I witnessed that screamed the director that I love, but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from Ken Burns' \"Looking at America\" class. I hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film. Instead of keeping us by Alvin's side throughout his journey, Lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn. There is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while, but when the same images were used over and over again, I nearly felt Lynch was humoring us with the dulls of Iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about. I think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film. He needed something to couple with the authenticity of Alvin, but the stock-footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for. I also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way. Alvin was a walking storybook, filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well. Lynch made Alvin very closed minded, which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature. Alvin was a strong character, but I needed more with this story. I wanted him to make choices, learn new things, and bring that to his brother's table when they eventually met. I felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if Lynch was saying that this journey through Americana was that we could learn from Alvin, and not vice-versa.Overall, I wasn't stunned by this picture. I thought Lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just \"played it safe\". The overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with Alvin. Speaking of Alvin, why couldn't he have been a stronger, better-rounded character? I felt after watching this film that Lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of America, but instead gave us nothing more than soft music, recycled images, and stock characters. The stories were interesting to listen to, but brought nothing fresh to the table. I must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye (since I have a brother as well), but why couldn't we focus on this further. Lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan, when it was the central focus of this film. The Straight Story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for Lynch, but instead it felt jagged and old. I could suggest one viewing for this film, any further, and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be! Grade: ** out of *****",

So being a fan of all that I knew I would see The Straight Story eventually (although it wasn't one of his that i was looking forward too much), but look at that. For all it's simplicity it is as powerful of a film that Lynch has ever done.I am so happy that Lynch is able to make a film like this. Before this, his most straight-forward film in terms of narrative was no doubt The Elephant Man. But even that film still has some really bleak and surreal imagery going on. Lynch has a really devoted fanbase, but I am sure many critics wouldn't have thought he would be able to direct a film like this. Lynch proves them wrong. He has a humanity and passion that runs throughout his films, and as much of a visceral and visual director that he is, he is also very much an actor's director. He has directed actors to incredible performances, like Watts in Mulholland Dr, Dern in Inland Empire, and Lee in Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me. Richard Farnsworth is completely captivating in his portrayal of Alvin. He invokes such deep emotions and gives perhaps one of the most nuanced and subtle performances I have ever seen. This doesn't feel theatrical in one bit. For the film's emotional pull I always wonder how much a film can get away with before becoming corny and overly-sentimental, but to my surprise The Straight Story never crossed that path. It's because Lynch isn't trying to make us feel with editing tricks, loud sad music, or corny sentimental dialogue. It is all in his direction and in the actor's faces. The entire cast is pretty great. They all have limited screen time but they all hit a deep spot in me. This is an incredible film, as great as a film of this nature could be. Heck, I didn't even think I was going to love it, but I did. It is one of Lynch's best films and stands out in his filmography, making it all that more special.",

The credits open with \"Walt Disney Pictures present a David Lynch Film\u00bb and it's just surreal: having Lynch & Disney together for a movie, it's like having night and day at the same time.But those credits help setting the movie: forget Lynch's previous unintelligible works, filled with sex, violence, twisted dreams and fantasy. Here's you get a straight story, a biopic without any effects or make-up. Stripped of all his trademark, is a naked Lynch still among the best filmmakers ever? Yes, totally because if all the dark side of Lynch is purged, there is only left his bright side.With a story that seems impossible to direct (a road movie with a lawnmower), that break all Hollywood clich\u00e9s (about old age, no violence, no guns, no sex...), Lynch delivers a naturalistic tale, a movie that is an hymn to the nature and the wisdom of old age. The lateFarnsworth has a face that says it all: Death is coming, it's time to confess the heart and to save the essential, the family. At 79 years old, he will have master his craft until the end and it's really a SHAME that the best actor award went to Spacey (being selfish and keeping the Oscar for himself, i wish he will have a shorter career than Farnsworth!). Hence, is-it a sign that he dies shortly after the ceremony? The other great loser of the movie is Badalamenti who scored his best soundtrack here: simple, moving, haunting. Just imagine the movie without his music and you'll tear its heart (for the fun, the best music ward went to the \"Violon Rouge\" by John Corigliano, great composer, 4 soundtracks in his career, none since the Oscar, ever heard about him?).Lynch was very sincere to shoot the movie in the actual locations because you really understand what happened to this old brother and you can seen the landscape changing along the road.In conclusion, if I have the same fun watching the speedy highway strips of \"Lost Highway\" as watching the slow national strips of \"the straight story\", then you can be sure that the director is indeed a master!",

            "content": "The Straight Story can really only be summed up in one word: simple. The title is all the movie is; it delivers what it promises. It is the story of Alvin Straight, a likeable old man who 'has seen just about all that life can offer', who has to travel on his lawnmower for six weeks to see his dying and estranged brother Lyle.Essentially it is just another example of the classic travel saga, an eventual throwback to such literary classics as Gulliver's Travels as it contains nothing more than a lot of long shots of seemingly endless country roads along with trials and tales that befall Straight and the people he meets along the way, including a very saccharine encounter with a pregnant teenager who has run away from home.The film-making itself is again simplistic; David Lynch has done some very good work with what is not at all a complex tale. A large number of long-held pauses between characters are beautifully timed as they inevitably mix to yet another long shot of a country road or a close-up of the tyres of the lawnmower as it continues to plow on across roads and boundaries. The repeated motif of the night stars is nicely used to illustrate the continual unity of people and family despite the distance, either physical, or emotional, between them.Finally, the lead performances are all excellent; Richard Farnsworth is perfectly cast as Straight and Sissy Spacek also does a fine job as his daughter Rose. However, some of the minor characters, particularly at the start, give somewhat one-dimensional performances that struggle to get the film moving; we really don't get a good insight into Straight's character until fifty miles into his journey, but from then on it's excellent acting all the way.Overall, the film is a warm, sentimental tale that provides uplifting drama and should bring a smile to all who watch it. 4 and a 1/2 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "In the town of Laurens, Iowa, Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) is a 73 year old man with failing eyesight and diminished mobility who lives with his mentally challenged daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek). When Alvin gets word his estranged brother Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton) has suffered a stroke 370 miles away in Mount Zion, Wisconsin, Alvin becomes determined to visit Lyle and make peace with his brother in the time both of them have left. As no buses go from Laurens to Mount Zion and Alvin has long since lost the ability to drive a car, Alvin modifies a riding mower and modifies a trailer to carry supplies and shelter as he travels the 370 miles to visit his ailing brother.The Straight Story is based on the true story of Alvin Straight a man who captured national attention due to his story about traveling 240 miles from Laurens, Iowa to Blue River, Wisconsin to visit his ailing brother using a riding mower. David Lynch's frequent collaborator Mary Sweeney learned of the story in a New York Times article in 1994 and had wanted to acquire the rights to produce a feature film, but the rights had already been secured by Ray Stark as a potential vehicle for Paul Newman (that was ultimately never made). Following Straight's death in 1996, the rights became available again with Sweeney acquiring them and co-writing the script with her childhood friend John Roach. David Lynch upon reading the finished draft loved it and set to direct the film with Lynch's first choice for Alvin Richard Farnsworth taking on the role despite hesitance as he was suffering from terminal cancer but took the role out of admiration for Straight. Filmed independently, the film had a successful debut at Cannes where it was acquired by Walt Disney Pictures. The movie was a massive critical hit with many lauding Lynch's divergence from his usual material and the performance of Richard Farnsworth was universally praised even earning Farnsworth a nomination at the Academy Awards for Best Actor (that unfortunately lost to Kevin Spacey's performance in American Beauty). The Straight Story is a strong character piece that is a challenging sit, but a rewarding one.At its core, The Straight Story is a meditation on what it means to grow older as we reflect upon our lives and the mistakes we made. Despite Alvin being presented with other opportunities to get to his ailing brother, Alvin remains steadfast in his commitment to make it to Mount Zion himself in what Alvin discusses as \"swallowing his pride\". Despite battling cancer at the time of production, Farnsworth gives us the same level of commitment and endearing eccentricity that earned him praise in The Grey Fox and as Matthew in the miniseries adaptation of Anne of Green Gables. There's a strong element of likability to Alvin Straight as a weathered salt of the Earth man whose pride has softened with age but remains steadfast in his principles. Spiritually speaking the movie has more in its DNA that links it to the works of Wim Winders than David Lynch as it's a road movie with very European sensibilities where the journey on the road is used for meditation on character and themes of regret and reconciliation. In between the lengthy sequences of Alvin traversing the beautifully shot landscapes of Iowa and Wisconsin there are breaks in the story where Alvin meets other characters along the way and shares his wisdoms while listening to their stories be they swapping World War II stories with fellow veterans or offering sympathetic ears to wayward travelers.Despite the themes of regret and reconciliation, the movie also features Lynch's trademarked off kilter sense of humor that only he can truly give us with memorable exchanges involving fraternal twin brother mechanics named The Olsen Twins, a woman who has a massive rant after being fed up with hitting one deer a week on her drive home from work, or Alvin's neighbor asking in a panic \"What's the number for 9-1-1?\" that adds so much needed levity to the proceedings to keep the tone from getting overwrought. The movie is very slow and deliberate with its storytelling as most of what we see is Alvin traveling via his mower but all this builds up to a deceptively simple ending that says a lot without saying much of anything at all and it's the kind of scene only two legendary actors, a legendary director, and solid effort from all three could give us to make a scene this quiet unleash a gusher of emotional catharsis.The Straight Story is one of the best films I've ever seen and Richard Farnsworth gave us a powerful and emotionally raw performance before his unfortunate death. Watching The Straight Story I was fascinated from the opening and fell in love with this story and its characters up until the quiet but very poignant end.",

Well, to quote the great American composer, artist and thinker John Cage, 'I am interested in forms that we can't discuss, but only experience.'

Which oddly enough, is a main theme of Paris, Texas, which Harry Dean Stanton starred in.  Lynch surrounds Alvin Straight with lots of people going a lot faster than he is, while he himself prefers a slow and very deliberate pace.  It's a very potent message: slow down and see how much more you can see, experience and perceive.  A great change of pace for Lynch.  When it premiered at Cannes I'd heard that if you missed the credits, there's no way you'd be able to tell that Lynch directed the film. Not true.  The whole film is filled with great Lynchian moments and images. I knew I'd probably like The Straight Story, but halfway through I found myself deeply in love with the film's beautiful poetry.

Melodramatic - Alvin discusses his W.W.II service with another man in a bar. Alvin believes he killed an American solider while serving as sniper in France.  He's never told anyone before!!! Trite - Alvin tells a group of young bike riders that the \"worst part of being old is remembering what it's like to be young\". Disgusting - Alvin tells a young pregnant runaway that she needs to go back to her family. Family is more important than the individual. Not only does this Kantian, proto-Nazi philosophy disgust me, Alvin had to use the old bundle of sticks analogy to illustrate it. Then there's the scene with the \"woman driver\" who can't make it to and from work without hitting a deer. (I guess that's funny, but woman driver jokes are hardly original.) The worst part of the movie is the acting of Sissy Spacek. She plays Alvin's mentally challenged daughter. She painfully draws out her stuttered lines.

You'd think it was a flight of the imagination, this Blanche DuBois pipe dream, if the movie weren't rooted in a reality, supposedly anyway. Straight is a 73-year-old man from in Laurens, Iowa, who finds out that his brother is failing and resolves to see him one last time. His sight is too poor for him to drive. He lives with his slow daughter Rose, who is hopeless at the wheel. Nor do they have a car. But they have a tractor, and the second Alvin's eyes happen upon it, he knows how he can drive the 300 miles to Mt. Zion, Wis. The first mower goes kaput, but he gets another one, a John Deere, hooks a small trailer to it, and intractably sets off.En route, we discover a lot about Alvin, including an anguished secret he has kept ever since the war. He's not an erudite guy, but when he talks, the words emerge like the bones of something very durable. The screenplay by John Roach and Mary Sweeney unearths rhapsodic balladry and profundity in the precise selection of the right everyday language. Richard Farnsworth says the lines with ideal tranquillity and sincerity. Since the film is directed by David Lynch, who deals in esoteric, terrifying films, we keep expecting the suspense to diffuse with what we feel will be obvious, for Alvin's journey to cross Frank Booth, Laura Palmer and Eraserhead's threshold. But even when he comes across a possible eccentric, like the hysterical woman whose car has killed over two dozen deer in one week on the same expanse of highway, she's not a sideshow act, and we identify with her. You can hit a good deal of deer on those country roads.Alvin's voyage to his brother is one into his past. He recalls when they were young and overflowing with awe. And his courtship and marriage. His Army service as a sniper. And about years squandered by drinking and spite. He has surfaced from the furnace of his failings as a better man, cleansed, down-to-earth, and people along the way seem to get that impression.In one town where Alvin happens after losing control of his mower, the John Deere guy he comes upon is Danny, who lets Alvin camp in his backyard. Alvin won't enter the house, for any reason. Danny's an uncommon guy, innately gentle and discreet. He personifies all of our own thoughts about this endearing old oddball. He tenderly makes suggestions, but Alvin is inflexible: \"You're a kind man talking to a stubborn man.\" If Riordan, the deer lady, the two bickering twins on the way into town and a despondent young girl are the backdrop, so are the surroundings themselves. Cinematographer Freddie Francis understands how to stir up a countryside without making it too reassuring. There are pastures of swaying corn and grain here, rivers, woods and little bed barns, but the wind we hear sighing through the trees is a gloomy and lonesome noise, and we're reminded not of the landscape we drive past on road trips, but en route to a memorial service, or on autumn days when the roads are bare but the look of the sky and the smell of the air fill you with a meditative somberness. The faces in this film are among its riches. Farnsworth himself has a mug like an old crumpled wallet you just can't bring yourself to replace. It's been attached to you for too long.There's another old man who sits beside him on a barstool late in the movie, whose expression is like the onlooker to all time. And the actor who plays the bartender in that same late scene, the one who serves Alvin the Miller Lite, taps the perfect timbre: He knows how all good bartenders can appear like a chum bringing flowers to a deathbed. The film is such a rambling voyage that it's easy to forget Sissy Spacek's mesmeric performance as Rose, completely riveting in her behavior, mannerisms and utter altruism.The final shades are also spot on. Who will this fading brother be, and what will he say? Will the screenplay say too much or fumble for obligatory over-romanticizing? Not by any means. Simply because you have to see someone doesn't mean you have a lot to talk about. Regardless of how far you've come to see them. It's a gesture more powerful than any words.",

            "content": "I love this movie, even though it's not typical from David Lynch , save for some moments here and there (take the grocery scene with Alvin Straight's daughter and the clerk for an example), and even though perhaps I would never have watched it, had the director been someone else. Along with Lynch, composer Angelo Badalamenti also makes the transition to produce a film score that's rather unusual based on the career record. And it's not only the irregularity by way of which their - Lynch's and Badalamenti's - performances match. They both weave brilliance out of the most linear/straight simplicity.The film does sometimes go very directly for the tear-drop effect, but does so so openly as an old man finding unexpected audience, in you or any other stranger, would, in telling his story. You can't help but accept that as fair and be understanding to the whole venture. Richard Farnsworth shows us an especially likable character. He's witty, he does surprise you sometimes how much. At one point or another you'd think now he's surely in a dead end, but then he already seems to know the way on. No spoiler in telling you he uses a lawn mover to start with... A film full of respect after which you'll look at the star-filled sky and think, instead of the loneliness of standing on a planet speeding through empty space, making no sense, of how just a little care for each other can make this a great place.This film is essentially the opposite of 'Lost Highway'.",

            "review_title": "David Lynch's Best Film",
            "content": "This is the black sheep of David Lynch's filmography. Even Dune doesn't stick out as much as this because that still feels distinctly Lynchian in all of its deeply flawed glory. There's a single sequence that feels like the work of the man who made Eraserhead and Lost Highway, and it's integrated so well into the quiet tale of an old man on one final trip to visit his dying brother that it never sticks out. This feels like, to a certain degree, Lynch's The Age of Innocence, a movie that feels out of his wheelhouse but he demonstrates he can handle with extreme tact and skill. It might also be my favorite movie he's made.Based on the real story of Alvin Straight who drove more than two hundred miles from Iowa to Wisconsin to visit his estranged brother on a lawnmower the entire way, taking about six weeks to make the journey. Portrayed by Richard Farnsworth, Alvin is a well of experience and deep feeling, barely able to walk, blind enough to fail any driving test, and angry for ten years over an argument with his brother Lyle (the real brother's name was Henry) that he can't remember the specifics of. When he receives word that Lyle has suffered a stroke, Henry decides that the only thing he can do is go, and he has to go on his own. He hitches a trailer up to his old red lawnmower which breaks down a few miles out of town, and he's forced to buy a newer John Deere in order to make the trip.This is a road movie, and it's interesting how it's structured. The people he meets get progressively older as he goes. The first is a young girl running away from home because she's secretly pregnant. Using some homespun wisdom about family, he convinces her to go back home. He encounters a group of cyclists as they zoom past him on the road. Meeting up with them at their camp later, they cheer him for arriving and he tells them that worst part of growing old is remember being young. He witnesses a women driving alone who rams straight into a deer. She is beyond distraught because she runs into one a week, killing them all, and she loves deer. Alvin takes the deer, cooks it, and mounts the antlers on his trailer.This being a road picture, all of these seemingly unrelated events tie intimately to Alvin himself, the main character. As he goes, interacting with these people, we can sense the deep regret hiding just under the surface as he talks about family, youth, and uncontrollable events. Most of the time, though, he's chugging along on the side of the road, alone, and when his transmission fails down a hill and he nearly crashes into a burning building being used for firefighter practice. This small sequence is where the movie is most traditionally Lynchian with a montage of fire dominating the screen while Alvin struggles to control his lawnmower and the soundtrack dominates with sounds of burning. This isn't just a sequence to by flashy in a largely unflashy movie, this is Alvin facing his mortality and the potential of Hell that could await him.It's no coincidence that he ends up truly opening up shortly after.Having to wait a little while for mechanics to come out and fix his transmission, Alvin camps out in a friendly couple's back yard, refusing to go inside for any reason, even when he needs to use the phone to call his daughter (Sissy Spacek, wife to this film's production designer Jack Fisk who helped finance Eraserhead) to get his social security checks forwarded to him. He spends an afternoon at a bar (drinking only milk since he's sworn off alcohol) with another man his age, and they end up swapping war stories. The other man tells of the German bomb that cooked all of his buddies alive. Alvin talks about his time as a sniper and how he shot one of his buddies in the middle of the night thinking he was an incoming German scout, everyone assuming the next day that he had been killed by a German bullet. It's here where Farnsworth moves beyond a kindly old man to showing the audience the depth of his feelings. It's not some random event from Straight's past to bring up. It's about another event in a long life that Straight regrets, a life full of such events including his fight with his brother.When he eventually gets back on the road (including another wonderful scene where he negotiates adeptly with a pair of twin mechanics and gets them to re-evaluate their cantankerous relationship), Alvin makes the final leg of his journey. He stops at a bar a few miles from Lyle's house and has his first alcohol in decades (a Coors Light) in an effort at liquid courage only to break down a couple of miles from Lyle's house. All that way, just for the black smoke to suddenly pop out of his engine and leave him dead on the road.When Alvin does make it to Lyle's house, the brothers have little to say to each other, but they still manage to communicate through what little they say. Lyle inviting Alvin to sit despite the decade of antagonism behind them is one thing, but when he asks Alvin if he had driven the whole way on that lawnmower, Alvin's insistence on doing it himself makes complete sense.Alvin Straight, the character, was a man who had lived a very long time and seen a lot of things. His long journey across the Midwest, including the kinds of loving natural inserts that could be found in a Malick film but are also flip sides of Lynch's earlier evocations of industrialization in other movies, is Alvin finding some kind of closure the things he's lost and done that he regrets, finding a way to salvage what he can in the little time he has left. Anchored by Farnsworth's marvelous central performance with wonderful smaller performances from a wide ranging cast, Lynch deftly directs this slice of Americana with simplicity and remarkable skill. Thematically, the movie fits with Lynch's body of work, though it's a rather dramatic stylistic removal. However, despite some of the very real highs that Lynch has found in going the non-traditional route, I have a sneaking suspicion that this might be my favorite film he ever made.",

            "content": "The Straight Story is a quiet, subtle, G-rated tale of a stubborn old man (Richard Farnsworth) who undertakes a six-week, 200-plus-mile journey from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin in 1994. Alvin Straight, 73 years old, is a physical wreck of man. He needs two canes to get around. He can't drive due to poor eyesight. But his estranged brother has just suffered a debilitating stroke, and Alvin is determined to go see him. Since he can't drive, and since he'll be damned if he'll let someone in a bus drive him there, Alvin chooses the mode of transportation he knows best - a 1966 John Deere riding mower. This is such an odd movie for a filmmaker like David Lynch to make. The creator of such cultish films as Eraserhead, Dune, and Blue Velvet generally makes weird, offbeat movies. His films are usually rated R (or worse), and are brimming with stylish violence and a real sense of atmosphere, creepy as it may be. With The Straight Story, none of these characteristics are apparent. I half-expected to see Alvin turn into a homicidal maniac who likes to lop off ears and drink the blood out of them in a crazed, stylish, symbolistic dance. But no, this was as gentle, as moving a movie as you'll see nowadays (aside from certain made-for-cable movies). There isn't an ounce of meanness, not a whit of wickedness, not one dollop of demonic possession. It's as placid as a quilting bee, and what's more, it's absolutely beautiful. If you've seen any of Lynch's movies, you know the director has his own trademark  camera angels and movements, and these are unmistakable in this film, as well. From each loving look at the amber waves of grain (okay, maybe they're golden) to the stark farmhouses poised in repose, each camera angle seems to have been painstakingly tended to. There's love in the details, friends, and this is one of those rare, rare movies that'll stay in your mind for years. And to top if all off, you have an Oscar-nominated performance from Richard Farnsworth, a former stuntman-turned-thespian. There's hardly an emotion from cranky old Alvin Straight for most of the film, the repressed WWII vet on a mission. The casting couldn't have been better in this movie. Farnsworth is an absolute delight as Alvin, and his eyes are more revealing than the faces of many well-paid actors. Tired, wrinkly, and a little despondent, Alvin's eyes express everything from sadness to resignation to resilience. The moment when Alvin finally reaches his brother's house is very memorable, the kind film scholars should be talking about for decades.",

Though I love David Lynch, this film is about as far away from experimental Lynch as you can get, and when I watch Lynch, I usually want weird experimental stuff (like doppelgangers, cyclical storytelling, and personifications of death).This film has none of that experimental stuff; it is, as the title implies, just a straight story, but it does have a few moments where characters behave in ways that I would consider very Lynchian. What makes this film great is not just Lynch's direction, but the wonderful writing, which contains so many simple but important lessons an elderly man imparts on the people he meets upon his journey, from young college kids to war vets with stories similar to his. This is an incredibly simple but powerful tale, one that still touches on the existential themes around which Lynch has crafted a career.This is one of the best road trip movies I've ever seen, right up there with \"Wild Strawberries\" and \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\".",

Yet it seems to relish in the simplicity of this man's life and the determination in his journey. Along the way he impacts many people and reminds them of the simpler things that life can bring. I found Richard Farnsworth to be so charming, and had a number of good laughs at how he handled the difficulties of what he was doing. The end of the film could feel so mundane, but because of what we learn about our main character along the way, I found it deeply emotional. It's an unexpected movie that sneaks up on you with subtle humor, and emotions.One thing that David Lynch knows how to do better than any other director is finding quirky actors who create a quaint atmosphere. The Straight Story feels like it is actually filmed in a tiny town right in the middle of Iowa. The people we meet along the way also have a unique quality that make them stand out. Ironically, the most recognizable actor in the entire film is the one I found the most underwhelming. It's not that Sissy Spacek is bad in the film, but her stutter always felt forced and over-rehearsed. It never came across as natural. Aside from that, there was very little that I disliked about The Straight Story. It has that understated warmth that could easily make for a film that I sit down to enjoy with some comfort food and a warm blanket just to make me feel good.",

An unexpected turn by director Lynch (*Blue Velvet* and *Wild At Heart*), without any of the irony and surrealism that he thrives on. A gorgeous score emphasizes the endless sweeping shots of America The Beautiful, with the attendant spacious skies and amber waves of grain. This is the backdrop for the story of Alvin Straight (Farnsworth), who, for a variety of reasons, decides to drive his lawnmower 300+ miles to see his brother. It is a true story, and you know right off the bat, that this is going to be a tearjerker \u0096 Alvin is increasingly infirm at 73, and learns that his estranged brother has had a stroke. He lives with his daughter, Rose (Spacek), who is \"slow.\" This is the most mature Sissy yet \u0096 she could rest on her laurels and still be hailed as a major actress entering her fourth decade of movie-making \u0096 though in this, she is a minor, but unforgettable, character, and has excellent assistance from the other supporting cast.

            "content": "If you are considering buying/renting/watching \"The Straight Story\", you should know that people are not lying when they tell you that it is nothing but an old guy (played by Richard Farnsworth) who decides to make a 300+ mile trip on his small riding lawnmower. He meets a lot of nice ordinary people, he dispenses a little sage advice, he reflects a little on his life, and nothing much happens to him. It is closely based on a real event that was newsworthy not because of what happened to Alvin Straight on his journey, but because of the human-interest angle of a guy making a journey in such a unique way.David Lynch does a nice job of directing this Disney production, but do not expect a lot of wild expressionistic developments.A lot of people really like this film and a lot of other people are asking, \"why do people like this movie so much\"? And they are the polite ones. Less polite ones are branding the film \"manipulative\" which seems like a strange criticism for a film. Aren't they supposed to be manipulative? Don't people watch films to be manipulated? If you insist on viewing \"The Straight Story\" and if you generally know what you are getting into, you should enjoy it. If you are looking for its deeper meanings I suggest that you watch it along with Monte Hellman's \"Two Lane Blacktop\". Both are road pictures and Alvin Straight's orientation as a young man was probably not much different than the driver (James Taylor) in that film. The difference is the stage of life in which the journey is being taken. Both have an intended destination. But for the driver in \"Two Lane Blacktop\" it is just a excuse to keep on the move, the highway stretches out endlessly before him and life is a journey not a destination. For Straight it is a single-minded trip that he views as his last chance to mend fences with his brother who has just had a serious stroke. It is very likely the last trip he will ever make but he does not savor the journey, he does not take satisfaction in overcoming obstacles, or even find much pleasure in his positive encounters with strangers. For him the destination is all important.This was Farnsworth's last picture, his health declining he committed suicide by gunshot a few months after the film's release. One can't help but speculate on whether he was aware during filming that \"The Straight Story\" would be the final act of his long career, and how much of that realization was incorporated into his performance.Straight's journey is a lot like that of Ned Merrill (Burt Lancaster) in \"The Swimmer\". Merrill got it into his head that he could restore things to how they were in his idyllic past if he could just swim home one afternoon through the backyards of his wealthy Connecticut suburb, using his neighbors' pools. Straight is not that delusional but he has come to believe that his brother will remain alive and be waiting for him as long as he stubbornly sticks to his original idea of traveling by mower.His other motivation for insisting on this means of travel (he won't take a bus and he turns down a ride for the last 60 miles) is to demonstrate how sincerely he wants to reconcile. If you give someone a horse it will be a lot more impressive if it is your only horse and it means that now you will have to walk. To walk is part of the gift.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",

No smoke and mirrors from director Lynch, a surprising departure from his eccentric and often confronting style, with a vivid, resonating performance from Farnsworth in his swansong.The score, scenery and especially the acting is first rate; Farnsworth's sad blue eyes speak volumes more than the need for dialogue and his interactions with the cast (that includes Sissy Spacek and chronically under-rated Everett MacGill in minor supporting roles) are only ever sporadic and brief. The sentimental favourite at the millennium Oscars, Farnsworth didn't win the prize, but instead left this wonderful tome as his film epitaph - a bittersweet footnote and legacy to this humble story.If, as a Lynch fan, you were expecting shock and awe, or just prefer watching films where things blow up, then you've come to the wrong place. If you're content to recline for a while and simply absorb the experience, then you should be rewarded.",

It is inspiring, provocative and you find yourself just cheering at the end for the understated love between 2 estranged brothers.

It's a thoughtful meditation on what really matters in life, the unbreakable bonds of family, the small kindnesses that can change lives, etc. But Lynch, being Lynch, can't resist emphasizing the baroque aspects of the characters, and I smell a misanthrope with a condescending streak. Everybody's just a little too fat, a little too slow, a little too defined by their physical beings or minor tics. Farnsworth, as the quietly stubborn guy-on-a-tractor, is incapable of an undignified line reading or a false gesture. And there are some affecting episodes throughout; loved the utterly normal couple who put Straight up while his tractor gets fixed, and the priest who offers him meat and potatoes. Those finding profundity in this tiny, tiny tale, though, probably are looking to pronouncements like, \"your brother's your brother, no matter what,\" or, \"the worst thing about growing old is remembering your youth.\" These aren't earth-shaking ideas. And while it's a leisurely, un-pushy movie, all I see ultimately is a resolute old coot on a John Deere.",

I had read so many superlative reviews of this movie that I suppose I should have known it could not live up to such high expectations. I found it to be a very good film, and certainly against the Hollywood studio standard of pacing and action, in that it is lyrical, understated to the point of being laconic, and moves at a - to put it gently - extremely relaxed pace. The movie seems to take as much time as Alvin took to get from Laurens to Mount Zion. Having said that, the characters keep us engaged and we need to see how Alvin finishes up (it is worth remembering that this is based on a true story). There is also some extremely dry humor (the scene in which Alvin walks through the kitchen with a shotgun is a howler). Richard Farnsworth is absolutely perfect in this role, and Sissy Spacek should have gotten some sort of award for her straight-on and sympathetic portrayal of a smart women perceived as \"challenged\". To sum up, this is a tender, touching story about family relationships that is worth seeing, but it helps if one really enjoys watching fields of wind-swept corn.",

            "content": "**Possible Spoilers**\t\tIt's a journey of the soul as a man goes home in his heart, in this dramatization of the true story of Alvin Straight, who drove a lawn mower over three-hundred miles through the state of Iowa and into Wisconsin, to see his brother, a stroke victim with whom he had not spoken for ten years.  `The Straight Story,' directed by David Lynch, recounts the story of Alvin (Richard Farnsworth), who set out to see his brother, Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton), upon hearing of his stroke.  Alvin is prevented from driving  because of poor eyesight, and he won't take a bus because he doesn't trust another's driving.  A widower who lives with his daughter, Rose (Sissy Spacek), Alvin, not a man of means, resorts to the only way he knows how, to get to Lyle.  He needs to put the bad blood behind them before it's too late; an estrangement born of `anger and pride.'  Hauling a make-shift trailer, and with three five-gallon cans of gas and a cooler full of hot dogs, Alvin sets out, alone and determined, on his lawn mower.  Now in the twilight of his life, having learned to `separate the wheat from the chaff,' the trip affords Alvin plenty of time to reflect on his life, and steels him in his quest to do what he feels he has to do. Along the way he befriends and is befriended by the strangers he encounters; a testimony to the bountifulness of the human spirit.  When a young man asks him what the worst thing is about being old, he replies, `Remembering when you were young.' \tRichard Farnsworth gives the performance of a lifetime as Alvin, this stubborn, prideful man, who has learned humility with age, and you can see the wisdom of his years in his eyes.  Farnsworth connects with the audience from the beginning, aptly conveying the yearning of a soul in need of atonement, and the determination of the man to effect his amends.  Sissy Spacek, also, gives a terrifically nuanced performance as Rose, the `slow' daughter who lives daily with demons of her own.  That the members of the Academy failed to nominate her for best-supporting actress for her work here is nothing short of criminal; her Rose is a beautiful piece of work.  David Lynch, as well, has done a remarkable job of bringing Alvin's story to the screen.  He has woven a rich visual and emotional tapestry, all poignantly delivered with a gentle hand.  Beautifully photographed, the lush vistas of the Midwest reflect Alvin's state of mind, underscoring the deeper meanings of what is really a spiritual journey, during which the past mingles with the present.  Lynch has taken a wistful, almost poetic approach throughout, which, together with the story is reminiscent of Ingmar Bergman's `Wild Strawberries.'  The scene in which Alvin finally meets up with Lyle is perfectly and touchingly executed, and is one of the most memorable scenes in the movie. \tThe supporting cast includes James Cada (Danny), Everett McGill (Tom), Barbara E. Robertson (Deer Woman), John Farley (Thorvald), and Kevin P. Farley (Harold).  With an artistic hand, Lynch has crafted an unforgettable film.  `The Straight Story' is Alvin's story, but the journey belongs to us; a reminder of what is really important in life, and the needs we all share at one time or another.  It's an entertaining movie that will touch you and make you think, as well; and as far as I'm concerned, that's about as good as it gets.     I rate this one 9/10.",

I say 'little' only because I'd never heard of it before today - I read the synopsis in my daily newspaper and just had to watch it. 'A man embarks on an interstate journey on a lawn mower!' Just how quirky can one get? It's the ultimate road movie, because it's slow and dwells on the journey itself as much as what happens along the way. Fantastic performances from the leading roles and all I was left with was a warm heart and moist eyes. Yet somehow this was brought about not by mawkish sentimentality, more by realistic responses to an old man on a mission.

Respectively, these times were: The Elephant Man, Twin Peaks: FWWM, Lost Highway, and The Straight Story.\nGoing into 'The Straight Story,' I was not worried that my opinion of Lynch would be threatened; after all, he had shown me with 'The Elephant Man' that Lynch can do sentimentality, but in this latest film the sentiment lacked the Lynchness. The beginning was great. Use of horizontal panning and life-like conversation (not afraid to put in akward pauses and such, like when the grabber is being bargained for) makes the movie more real and watchable. The characters were interesting as usual, the music is as good as can get with using the same tune throughout, and a variety of unique camera angles are used. Having him travel by mower is such a good idea, and I was surprised that the taking to the road coincided with a downturn in the movie. All the subtle and enjoyable indiosyncratic Lynchities I've been speaking of were replaced by sentimental rubbish. Many of the morals learned throughout the travels were stated metaphorically and indirectly, which eases the dislike I have for such movies, but it was not enough. Sentiment alone has been tried ad nauseum, there has to be something more. Lynches typical nuanced style could have surely solved this lack, I'm not sure why he abandoned it. The only answer I can reach is that Lynch is becoming elderly, perhaps senile, and the average hollywood clap trap is accepted.",

            "content": "I have to admit that while appreciation of David Lynch films is largely an adolescent phase, I still enjoy watching them now and again.  What I like most are the elements that betray immature fantasy - the Surrealism, the hysterical perversity, the childish darkness, the shallow enigma.  So while the idea of a 'straight' David Lynch film intrigued me (THE ELEPHANT MAN, for all its 'quality', was still about a man with the head of an elephant), every shot of THE STRAIGHT STORY was imbued with a foreboding of strangeness.  I don't think the film is as folksy and gentle as people make out, but it is oddly reactionary and sterile - there is no growth in character - everyone begins nice and ends nice; there is no idea of the journey narrative as moral progression; there is no tension or conflict in Alvin's aims and ultimate result.The film is a feast of pleasures, and for that should not be missed.  The opening sequence is sheer Lynch genius - beautiful, methodical establishing and long shots, setting the scene.  We've seen pretty openings like this in BLUE VELVET, and the sickly sweet lullaby score recalls TWIN PEAKS, so we expect this idyll to be destroyed.  The style is distanced and foreboding, as the camera's god's eye creeps fearfully forward and the music stops. Alvin's neighbour seems like a typical Lynch caricature, fat and blowsy, sunbathing and stuffing her face.  The sound we expect comes; it is a horrible thumping sound, possibly a muffled gunshot.  When we find out that Alvin has only slipped and can't get up, this defeating of real darkness with whimsy sets the tone for the rest of the movie.Also masterly are the bursts of real pain in the film, even if the emphasis on telling rather than showing is disappointing in so visual a director as Lynch.  The relationship between Alvin and his daughter tends initially to cornball movie-of-the-week, until a moving, yet slightly odd, shot, shows her watching a bouncing ball outside her window, followed by its owner, a little boy.  We might conclude that she has been a spinster, even a virgin, all her life, never emerging from the shadow of her father, a suggestion strengthened by all the bird-houses (traditional images of female captivity)she makes.  The truth is even more numbingly shocking than this.\nAlvin's final admisssion of his long-exorcised demons, the horrific blunder during the War, the hard drinking to forget after, the intimation of domestic violence, the never-explained rupture with his brother - all these have a jolting emotional power because of the whimsical framework that surrounds them.  They also make slightly less queasy scenes such as those with the pregnant teenager, or the priest, which are either so hicksy conservative as to be offensive, or so ironic as to betray or make redundant the rest of the film.  One brilliant scene features Alvin's talking with cocky young cyclists - his melancholy ruminations on death and the transience of youth cast a dark shadow over their greedy, bouyant hope.The other pleasures lie in character and image.  Although EVERYone is unbelievably decent, caring and concerned (except for Alvin's hilariously saturnine, walrus-moustached friend), they are blessed with sufficient quirks to entertain.  The delightful scene with the twin mechanics is like something out of Lewis Carroll.As for the film's visuals, Lynch's eye has not deserted him.  There is one extraordinary scene early on, when Alvin and his daughter sit in the dark living room to watch, like a film, a lightening storm.  This is a scene of tremendous emotional revelation, as well as vivid visual excitement.  The way Lynch frequently ignores Alvin's journey to concentrate on the autumnal bounty of Mid-West agriculture is sublime, and verges on the abstract.  And yet there is an unusual solidity to the film, as if Lynch had to remain faithful to Richard Farnsworth's honesty by recording every concrete detail of this seemingly insignificant man's life.Still, for all these, and many other good things, the film seems oddly pointless.  Alvin is far too wise and almost saintly to convince as a character.  His journey is either meaningless, or so obvious in it meaning (he certainly talks about it often enough) as to be redundant.  The final sequence reaches for a manly, understated emotional power it only retains because of the rare presence of the great Harry Dean Stanton.  STRAIGHT is frequently hilarious, always beautiful in its evocation of a timeless, sun-dusted world, but it just seems, to me, too easy.",

He gets his big opportunity to be a leading man at age 79 and he nails it.  Farnsworth plays Alvin Straight who takes a cross country odyssey on a riding mower to see his ailing brother with whom he has not spoken in ten years.This is a warm and touching story that takes its time unfolding.  Alvin's journey is a journey for the viewer as well. It is an excellent character study of a proud and cantankerous old man who is determined to cling to his self sufficiency and dignity and for whom failure is not an option.  It reminds us that behind the eyes of those old faces that we so often push aside, there are real people with strong principles, wisdom, experience and emotions worth far more than the value we place on them.Director David Lynch is to be commended for transcending his own usually bizarre mold in this film.  Though his pacing is decidedly slow, so is the lawnmower, so it is appropriate.  The prelude to Alvin's getting on the road was particularly deliberate and might have been condensed a bit, but once on the road the pacing was perfectly adapted to the story.  The locations were terrific, with numerous aerial shots of our beautiful heartland.  The story was presented with sensitivity and simplicity without a lot of visual gimmickry.  It's good to see a film where the story and not the filmmaking is the point.Farnsworth gives the performance of his career.  His portrayal makes Alvin determined and stubborn, but in a way that is lovable and charismatic.  His ability to distill complex emotions into simple expressions was masterful.My only real criticism was that Sissy Spacek gave what I thought was a sub-par performance for her.  I thought she overdid the speech impediment to the point where it hindered the dialogue.This is an absorbing and wonderful human interest story.  I rated it a 9/10. For those looking for fast paced action, this is not your movie.  For everyone else, see it soon and enjoy its simple enchantment.",

            "content": "David Lynch is, simply put, the greatest film director ever to put body and soul together.He started off with the weird and disturbing, yet very artistic, \"Eraserhead,\" which I won't even try to describe, went on to direct the incredibly stupendous, \"Blue Velvet,\" which, in my jumble opinion, is the greatest feature film ever made, anytime, anywhere. It's a crime film, but to even say that, lowers it to the realm of stuff like \"Pulp Fiction\" (which was great in its own right, but it was no Blue Velvet). Don't watch any of these with your kids, though.It's true though, that David Lynch directed a horribly bad adaptation of \"Dune.\" You could show this one to your kids, (if you don't mind boring them to death.) The problem with \"Dune\" wasn't really Lynch, though. It was the script and the fact that Lynch was way too faithful to it.He also directed the critically acclaimed (but nonetheless box-office failure) \"The Elephant Man.\" A damnyankee good film. But don't see it with your kids.And OF COURSE, he directed (AT THE SAME TIME!) the greatest TV series ever made, \"TWIN PEAKS!\" AND the Wizard of Oz spoof movie, \"Wild at Heart\" with Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern. But don't watch either one with your kids.Which (finally) leads me to my point. One David Lynch movie which you MUST see with your kids is THE STRAIGHT STORY. (A Walt Disney film, by the way.) David Lynch goes straight. Which is the first of the several thousand explanations of the title of the movie.\"The Straight Story\" is, first and foremost, the story of a man -- Alvin Straight. A good man. An old man. A man, who some ten or twelve years prior, had some harsh words with his brother of about the same (advanced) age, a man (Alvin I'm still talking about) who scoffs at his doctor's advice to stop smoking and to eat right. Both brothers are now in ill health. In fact, brother Lyle has just suffered a stroke.Alvin receives the bad news about Lyle's stroke, and despite Alvin's and Lyle's harsh falling-out of several years ago, and at least partially because of both their frailty and mortality, now must see him. (I mean, hey, wouldn't you?) He kisses his daughter (played by the ever-incomparable Sissy Spacek) goodbye and since he is a diabetic and his eyesight is failing and he can't drive a car anymore, gets on his LAWNMOWER and commences to drive three hundred miles at just about five miles an hour to see his poor, old, sick, estranged brother.The rest (and the most) of the movie is his incredible and so, so moving journey to see brother Lyle.I won't tell you everything that happens, but watch out for the (dear) deer lady, she's IT! And I won't tell you about the ending, except to say it's just what it needs to be. It's not overdone or underdone. It is just what it needs to be.But Lynch, he is such a devil. He can't help but include, in his first and only Disney movie, subtle references to his other (way more grown-up) movies, particularly \"Blue Velvet,\" (like the water hose flailing around, unmanned.) But see both and you'll know what I mean.I saw the first week it came to my city. The theater was PACKED. Mainly, I think, because of Richard Farnsworth, who played Alvin Straight. He got an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for this movie.He was a big star back in the forties and fifties. A lot of old people came out to see him in what was his swan song. I never saw so many wheelchairs in a movie theater. But the front three rows in the theater were all kids, there to see the next Disney movie. A mix like that I never saw before. (And of course, Lynch fans like myself.)Finally.... David Lynch makes a movie that is not only an artistic success, but is actually popular.",

This is a true story of an elderly retired man (expertly played by Richard Farnsworth) who decides to ride a tractor across a few states to pay a final visit to his estranged brother who now stands at death's door.  A beautiful score from Badalamenti, exquisite photography of rural life (love those aerial corn-field shots), and a sly director's hand that reveals man's basic humanity, this is a beautiful slice of life film.  Its extremely slow pace may lull some viewers to sleep, but those who stay for along for the ride will be well rewarded in the end.",

That this should come from of all places the direction of David Lynch is shocking. Lynch takes his amazing natural instinct for storytelling and simply turns off his typical desire to explore the strange and supernatural. What is left is an affecting film that in it's quiet power moves mountains. Richard Farnsworth a long time character actor gets a star turn as a man like any other only more so. Around the edges of the film lurk people whom you may glimpse when venturing outside of the dark of a theater and traveling across the unique areas of a specifically American backdrop. But these same people are virtually non-existent in film otherwise. The choice to direct film is surprising but hits it mark and the decision to film it in the actual locations that inspired it instead of cheating and filming elsewhere add a heavy dose of poignancy to the overall story. To many this will not be their cup of tea. But sit them down to watch it to the end and I'm sure few consider it time misspent.9/10.",

Just as Robert Duvall was robbed by Jack Nicholson in 1997, Richard Farnsworth (who I loved in Anne of Green Gables) was robbed by Kevin Spacey in 2000.I love movies that are based on true stories and/or character studies, and The Straight Story fits either bill. Sissy Spacek does such a good job, I would've loved to see more of her in the movie. Richard Farnsworth carries the movie and does a wonderful job as the stubborn yet determined Alvin.A very good effort by David Lynch and all involved. Cuddle up on a lazy day with The Straight Story.

            "content": "Richard Farnsworth's face can carry a movie. The Grey Fox, this; he epitomizes something, something very honest and so loaded with character that you barely need a plot. Unusual for Lynch to do something this straightforward but some of his shots of the starry skies superimpose a dimensional filter and you briefly see some stars moving in front of others and your back in Eraserhead for a second, and that's about the right time frame. The companion piece to this has to be \"Lucky\" where Harry Dean Stanton is the lead, at the real age of 90, and the last movie he made before he died, and David Lynch has a large role, and a very odd one, in another movie about character in a very old and very sane man.Like the character's name, Straight, Farnsworth could not be more to the point about his intentions and the way he carries them out strengthen the absolute clarity and rightness of his vision. He makes 2 explanatory speeches to kind strangers along the way, that gracefully fill in some background.It would be called a 'slow' movie, but since it is really about our return to the eternity we were all born INTO, what existed forever before us and will again when we are gone, speed isn't an issue here. The method Straight uses to reclaim his brother as a brother, and his stubborn adherence to no other way, underscore his patience, even with the urgency that impels his project. He must bow to the larger forces of uncontrol able fate. Sissy Spacek is unusual here too, playing a somewhat 'slow' person.So again, from the opening shot of a woman lounging in the sun,\nand all through the cycle of the film , about the journey from cradle to grave and what must be completed in between, this is not an action film. It's a soul film. This one will hit thoughtful watchers, like Cupid is using a mini-gun loaded with arrows.",

            "content": "It isn't a stretch to compare it to TOKYO STORY and MY DARLING CLEMENTINE. Like them, and like the recent works of his colleague Martin Scorsese, THE STRAIGHT STORY is an elegy for a lost world. It's been attacked as the unveiling of the covert Reaganite side of David Lynch--but if John Ford rose from the dead and pulled out one more, would we be calling him a right-winger as well? Seventy-three-year-old Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) makes a visit to his estranged and ailing brother--and his only means of transport is a four-mile-an-hour lawn mower. That's the extent of Lynchian oddity on display here; what takes its place is a cradling, legato rhythm, a brilliant score by Angelo Badalamenti, and collisions between Alvin and other Americans hiding a secret sadness. No epiphanies, no lessons and hugs--just genial, shyly understated brushes with grace.The fashion victim who made LOST HIGHWAY and WILD AT HEART is dead. His reincarnation seems to be a terribly sad (and prematurely aged) man. But the humanism behind Lynch's surreal visions is made clearer than it has been in twenty years: a supermarket conversation between two women using the word \"braunschweiger\" recalls Lynch's affection for a world no longer represented in television or movies. There isn't a single television set in THE STRAIGHT STORY; no one's on the Internet or playing CDs; nobody's T shirt advertises a product. The only hip joint in the movie is Alvin's broken one. A few coal-hearted souls may find it Hallmarkish; but the core of this tender and beautifully wrought movie is a nod of respect toward a vanishing form of human honor--not least the form practiced by its maker, who always tends to remind us (just when we forget) that he is one of our greatest movie artists.",

Despite the wonderful heartfelt performance by Richard Farnsworth, and some great cinematography, this film is just too slow for me.  I guess I could have anticipated that based on the fact that a lawn mower IS slow.  But a film doesn't have to move at break-neck pace to have something really important to say, and to say it well.  This movie didn't do either, I'm afraid.I did also appreciate the score by the Twin Peaks composer, and some scenes were very good-- the bundle of sticks, the low voices in the background (someone said it was a sound problem but I credit David Lynch for his realism-- were we far away from these people and that's how they would sound-- not up close like they were speaking into a microphone the way a \"normal\" movie would have you believe), the way the daughter's story is exposed, and so on.Overall I gave it a 6 out of 10-- I was disappointed and cannot recommend it to others.",

However, the film still retains a poetic nature as Alvin crosses the country seeking redemption like some kind of retired western hero on his old horse.

I thought the plot sounded contrived and I was afraid that the story would be banal. But being a David Lynch fan I decided to give it a go. It took me about 30 minutes to be fully captured by the movie, but then I was completely lost in it. There is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie! I left the cinema feeling that I had truly learned something valuable about life.This is not a typical David Lynch movie, and in some ways it was very surprising that he should make such a film after exploring the dark sides of human nature for so many years. On the other hand, I am not surprised that he manages to convey deep emotions and profound human insight because I also thought he managed that very well in The Elephant Man. Lynch is one of the most gifted directors around and I think The Straight Story is his best yet. 9.5/10",

Such is the case with David Lynch directing a Disney movie. With is project Lynch has been able to put his talent to use in order to empower people instead of frighten them and is very effective. What we have here is the tale of Alvin Straight, a 73 year old man who's brother who he hasn't talked to in 10 years has had a stroke. Feeling that time may be running out Alvin wants to travel from his home to Wisconsin to make peace with his brother before it is to late, but he can hardly walk, he needs two canes and with his eyesight slipping he can't get a drivers liscense. But bound and determinded Alvin decides he will ride his ageing lawn mower to Wisconsin. But short into his trip his lawn mower quite on him and he is forced to hitch a ride back home where he blowing the mower up and buys a new one to once again set out for Wisconsin. Along the way Alvin meets and touches charcters in many different shapes and forms including a mislead youth who is running away form home, a kind man who takes him in after the belt on his lawnmower snaps, an elderly WW1 vet who can't seem to shake the horrible memories that plage him and a priest. The film is like a living breathing Halmark card with such powerfuly moving lines like \"I used to play a game with my kids, I'd give them all a stick to break and of course they could, then I would tie the pieces into a bundle and they couldn't break in then I would tell them that bundel is a family.\" and when he tells that the worst part of being old is \"remembering when you were young.\" Richard Farnswerth plays Alivn and he recieved a well diserved Oscar Nomination for his heart shatter performance that hits the nail dead on with believablity. Lynch is perfectly suited for this film and all of his fans will no doubt see his trademark style in here just somewhat more subdued than usual, what can be said then man is a genious. Although the G rating makes it suitable for family viewing younger children will probably not find much to be desired here as the humor is light and will probably mostly appeal to adults who are looking for something a little deeper than your average teen movie or more goofy Dinsey movies like the Kid but nevertheless is a treat from beginning to end.",

On his trip, Alvin encounters some special folks who want to help him in his quest. He also touches lives himself, planting some of life's  lessons learned for others to benefit from.  Even though this film is rated G, it is NOT for youngsters or teens under 14. It is slow moving which fits with the long, slow journey, but it takes a certain degree of patience that few kids have. Richard Farnsworth is simply perfect as Alvin Straight. His daughter is played by Sissy Spacek who deserves a best supporting nomination come Oscar time. David Lynch can be very proud of this film. It is filled with characters we can love and take our time enjoying. If I had one thing I would have changed, it would be the casting of Harry Dean Stanton as Lyle, Alvin's brother. He looks far younger and completely different than Farnsworth. Also a scene with two lawn mower repair men brothers who seemed to over act a bit. But overall, The Straight Story is a heart warming experience that you will not soon forget.

The story is about a seventy-three-year-old stubborn but likable man, Alvin Straight, played charmingly by Richard Farnsworth, who at least deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance. Alvin's brother, Lyle, has had a stroke in Wisconsin, and Alvin decides it is his duty to travel from his home in Iowa and see him for the first time in ten years. But the problem is Alvin does not have a driving licence and his eyes are bad and so is his hip. So he decides the solution is to drive his lawnmower along with his trailer. The first attempt is doomed when the lawnmower expires and fails him. Alvin then shoots it with his gun to get some satisfaction. He then buys a 1966 green John Deere tractor which is more reliable. The journey is slow as you would expect, but is enlivened by the people Alvin meets, including a pregnant runaway girl, a lady driver who knocks down a deer, some bickering twin mechanics and a former World War Two soldier. The scene in which Alvin describes an incident to him he had in France in the war is very moving. There is another scene where Alvin is slowly moving along and is passed by a huge speeding truck which blows his hat off, as if it is a sign of the modern scramble to go faster and quicker, where as Alvin is content to travel at his own pace and still get to his destination eventually like the good old days. After a scrape descending a hill and meeting some other kind folks Alvin finally arrives in Wisconsin, and on the journey we are treated to wonderful cinematography from Freddie Francis, beautiful sound and music as always from Lynch's regular composer, Angelo Badalamenti, and a humble and delightful central performance. A very charming picture and an absolute pleasure to watch.",

            "content": "I love David Lynch, and I was very excited about the prospect of this film. The idea of Lynch directing a film like this did not surprise me at all. Lynch has always had a streak of sentimentality to some degree or other in all of his films, he has always appreciated natural beauty, and certain of his sequences have always been painfully slow. So I thought he would be the perfect guy to make the story of Alvin Straight a moving and mystical experience. I was very disappointed.The first half hour of this film is relatively good, with typical Lynch dialogue, shots and characters. But once Alvin goes out on the road, the movie loses its focus. The characters the he meets and interacts with on the road simply don't add up to much. Their stories are not compellingly drawn and are often more then a little too sentimental. The very act of Alvin's journey is also not really very well realized either: it its worst moments you feel like Lynch and the editor were sitting around saying \"well, I don't know what to do here, so let's throw in another cornfield, a cloudy sky, and a shot of the road.\" I'm left with the impression that Lynch worked well in setting up the journey--where he had a story and plot to work with--but lost his focus once the the journey began and the events and details that drive the film became much more subtle.One big mistake is these extensive helicopter shots flying over cornfields. I think this loses the perspective that Alvin experiences, that of being stuck going very slowly on the side of the road. They just lose the tone of the film. I also expected MORE coverage of the weather as it develops through the day, the small things Alvin sees as he makes his journey. You do get him looking at a storm once, but it mostly looks like a garden hose and a strobe light, and you don't get the sense of power and beauty that a real midwestern storm can display. The whole idea of this film is to slow down and take a careful look at natural things, and that just doesn't come across here. When Alvin tells some people that he's been on the road five weeks it's shocking, because you don't have a sense of the length of that journey at all. Alvin also refuses help on the way, saying he has to make this journey \"his way.\" I like the idea of the very arduousness of the journey being part of his act of homage to his brother, but that idea is not reinforced enough, and ultimately the viewer is really left at quite a distance from Alvin and his psyche.Mostly I felt this film was filled with signifiers of things that SHOULD have been moving, but ultimately the connections, when there, had to be stretched and filled in by the viewer. This is obviously a very ambitious film, and a great idea for a film, but I'm afraid the thematic connections just were not made. I'd say the script needed to be revised twice more before filming even began. It's too bad, but I'll still look forward to what Lynch does next.--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com",

            "content": "David Lynch's \"The Straight Story\" is the tale of a 73-year-old man named Alvin Straight that travels from Iowa to Wisconsin in order to see his estranged brother who has suffered from a stroke.Alvin Straight collapses in his kitchen and it's a sign that he must see a doctor and begin to take care of himself. He doesn't eat right and he smokes too much. He is a man who is clearly uncomfortable with his age.His friends and his \"slow\" daughter, played by Sissy Spacek, try to comfort him to the best of their abilities. Alvin finds out that his brother has had a stroke and this incident drives him to take a journey to reclaim the relationship he has lost with him.Being old, half-blind and without a license, Alvin begins to ride to Mt. Zion, in Wisconsin, riding on his lawn mower. Attached to the mower is a small trailer where he stores food, a chair and a blanket.He begins the trek only to have his mower die. He buys another mower and is well on his way to make the trek that will surely take him weeks to accomplish.The film is very slow in the beginning but it is not until Alvin begins to encounter individuals on his journey that you realize that this film is a masterful character study of a man coming to terms with the meaning of his life.He encounters a young lady on the road and Alvin relates to this pregnant-runaway how family is one of the most important things that she has going for her. After imparting to her his views, the girl disappears the next morning. Alvin is happy that he has steered this girl in the right direction.For the rest of the story, Alvin encounters such individuals. He tells a cyclist that \"the worst part of being old is remembering when your young.\" In a town where he stays at after a near accident he teaches twin mechanics to appreciate their brotherhood.Also in this town he tells one character his story of how he was in the war and how he accidentally killed a friend of his. This is a beautiful scene not only because it sets up the reasoning behind Alvin's alcoholism but also because Richard Farnsworth acts the part like a true master of cinematic acting.Farnsworth easily gives the greatest male performance of the year as a man coming to terms with his life and the importance of all the time he has left on this earth.It is a very slow film but utterly engrossing. Certainly vastly different from we have seen from Lynch in the past--but I won't dwell on that. Lynch captures landscape and the journey this man takes to re-claim stability in the final moments of his life with an introspection that is rarely seen in character-study films.Farnsworth emits so much emotion through every movement, every smile and every tear. He is a humble and simple man needing closure in his life. This is the story of a man whose place in the world has been already carved but must amend the relationships that are scared before he goes into the gentle starry sky. A beautiful, heart-warming and touching film.",

But that would be too easy and understanding Alvin Straight isn't going to be easy.  We wonder and we wonder throughout the film why anyone would travel over five weeks under such an unorthodox mode to see his stricken brother.  Not that Alvin is a spry old man either for he has poor eyesight and two bad hips.  It is only at the end that the true beauty of \"The Straight Story\" unfolds and then we are left with a warm and heartfelt feeling about an old man and about the goodness of a people who have always existed. You see, the basic character of America doesn't exist in money-grabbing, violent, in-your-face aberrations that comes across daily in our entertainment venues.  It still resides in everyday strangers who want to treat others as they would want to be treated.  \"The Straight Story\" could be labeled as homespun and out of touch.  Yet there is something inherently right about showing a runaway teenager that the strength of a family is like a bundle of twigs, about two war veterans who could commensurate over their shared war traumas, about young athletes who could never understanding aging until an old man brings it down to earth for them, and about quarreling brothers who are made to see that love is stronger than anything that would break them apart.  This film is beautifully acted from the indomitable Richard Farnsworth, the cameo by Harry Dean Stanton, and the superlative rendition of the disabled daughter by Sissy Spacek.  If I had a quarrel, it would be the gratuitous smoking (why does everyone have to light up?) that takes place and the crass commercials for John Deere tractors, Ace Hardware, and finally the word for word endorsement for Miller Lite.  \"The Straight Story\" refers not only to Alvin's tale but it tells us about who we are as American people and for that the filmmakers deserve no less than a standing ovation.",

For Lynch fans this is an odd u-turn before Mulholland Drive, Lynch's only true masterwork. Working on a simplistic script written by his partner, Lynch has directed a curiously quaint and old-fashioned tale that wouldn't be amiss on a 24 hour Disney channel. The fact he did not write the piece is why this isn't a proper Lynch film per se; rather it's his supposed detachment from the screenplay that defines the neutrality of his direction. However, there are some typically Lynchian moments but they are too brief and inconsequential to the story. As an exercise in linear narrative film Lynch did a very good job, pleasing those critics who hated his weirder works. Thankfully, he abandoned such styles in his later film Mulholland Drive and returned to what he did best.",

However, I trust Lynch to never let me down with a watered-down movie, and once again my faith was borne out. I'm glad this movie recieved that rating, because EVERYONE should see this film.It works on so many levels, I plan to see it at least twice more just so I can pick them all out. The central theme of the movie is The Journey, the literal one that was taken by Alvin Straight and the metaphorical one which everyone takes through life. The recurring image in the film of the stars slowly advancing, which is always displayed when someone is sitting still, indicates that even when you're doing nothing, you're still travelling, both literally and figuratively.Everyone in the movie does a superb job, especially Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek, who starts off as one of Lynch's cartoonish, oddball people who always pop up in his movies, and then develops through the movie into a fully fleshed-out human. This role, as well as her role in Affliction, reveals Spacek to be one of, if not the most underrated actors working today.There is the usual Lynchian imagery and characters, and some of the best cinematography and scenery I've seen since Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter. Where Egoyan's film was starkly beautiful, however, this one is varied, showing all the colours and textures of rural America in the last days of summer. Sheer magnificence.The moods are well-balanced. At different times one is laughing, horrified, saddened, but most of all it is affirming.For people who see Lynch as just a purveyor of weirdness, this will either be a refreshing change or a disappointment. But people who see film as a true art form will be overjoyed by this simple, yet beautiful, bit of storytelling by an artist who is obviously developing and continuing to mature and improve on his craft. Lynch has taken an inspirational story and packed it with so much more that this has now displaced Being John Malkovich as my favourite movie of the year. These two movies have proven that film is still a vital art form, and in the age of grand spectacle movies with no real plot or acting, this is food for a very hungry soul. 99 was a great year, let's hope it continues.",

The idea of a 75-year-old man traveling the country-side on a riding mower certainly doesn't have much appeal to it, but the real power behind the film is its charm and its intelligence.  Writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie work than \"The Straight Story.\"The perfect example of this is a scene in which Alvin meets a runaway teenage girl.  She's pregnant and afraid of what her parents would do if they found out.  Alvin tells her a story about his own kids, long ago.  He had them each take a stick and break it, which they could easily do.  Then he had them bundle the sticks and try to break them.  \"That bundle,\" he said, \"is family.\"  So many other movies would feel compelled to continue and make sure we knew that an individual could be broken but together the members were stronger.  \"The Straight Story\" realizes that we're smart enough to understand this and simply leaves us to contemplate the thought and draw our own conclusions.Alvin's journey across Iowa is full of such refreshingly un-Hollywood character interactions.  Each interaction is full of warmth and humor, and Alvin is so cute riding his mower that we can't help but smile as he makes his way to Wisconsin to make peace with his brother, Lyle, who has suffered a stroke.  And the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the real story here is not the destination but the journey.  It's a journey in which Alvin shares his life with everyone he meets--to their benefit and ours. It's a slow, simple, relaxing ride meant to remind us of all that we've lost with the urbanization of America.\"The Straight Story\" is the rare live-action \"G\"-rated movie that truly should not be missed.

He is a stubborn man who when the doctor tells him that he needs to get hip surgery refuses on the basis that he simply doesn't feel like it.

Alvin decides he needs to visit his brother and make peace for the last 10 years (in which neither of them have spoken to each other), but since he can't see well enough have a driver's license, he decides to take his lawnmower on the 300+ mile trip, dispensing fortune cookie wisdom to anyone who he happens to come into contact with... and that's it. Yes, you read that right, \"that's it\". For two hours we watch a tired old man on a lawnmower.The entire movie is an exercise in blandness and mediocrity. Whether it's the one-note acting, the countless repeated shots of cornfields and the open road, or the repetitive score (which recycles the same two musical cues over and over again for the entire movie). The movie is so bland that when we finally have a tender moment in the bar between Alvin and a fellow WW2 veteran we, the audience, no longer care because we stopped caring about Alvin over an hour ago. Then when he finally gets to his brother, they say two lines to each other and it ends. That's it. We don't even find out exactly why they fought in the first place, other than a fleeting reference about saying nasty words to each other.Indeed we, the audience, find ourselves saying \"that's it?\" for the entirety of the movie. Early on in the movie, Alvin's mower breaks down so he gets a back ride into town, buys a new mower and starts all over again. That's it. There's a scene where Alvin stops to talk to some young bicyclists to tell them that he hates being old, and then the scene ends. That's it. There's a scene where a lady runs into a deer and goes off for minutes on end about how she hates continually driving into deer, and then she drives away. That's it. There is no conflict, there is no message. The only person who really learns anything is a runaway teenager who learns the importance of family, and she isn't even important to the narrative.It has always been a tradition for conventional movie goers to wonder how critics have come to love certain movies. This is no exception. This movie, however, makes one wonder how it even got past scripting, let alone garnering the praise of every respected critic out there. There is not a single good thing that can be said about this movie, other than perhaps it is one of the first real attempts to show that G rated movies don't only have to be for the kiddies (though this movie probably should have been rated PG for some mild language and alcohol use, but it's a minor quibble really), but that effort is not enough for me to even consider this piece of celluloid to be anywhere near watchable or recommendable. All I can say is thank heaven that I didn't have to pay to see it.one half star out of five *I'd give it zero out of five, but even I recognize that it takes a lot of effort to make even a bad movie so the half star is for the hard work that went into it.

            "content": "The problem of generation gap is as old as the hills and has its impact almost in every family. It has been brought to existence by the rapid industrial and cultural changes in the world after WWII. Many scientists started researching this phenomenon, and many terms such as Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials, describing people born in the years 1946-1964, 1965-1979, 1980-1995 respectively, appeared. Each and every generation shared its own values, goals, and ways of life, which produced the source of inability to understand each other across generations. Apart from the publications of many scientific papers touching upon generation gap and related to it the issue of aging, this phenomenon gave its theme also to many Hollywood productions. One of such productions is David Lynch's brilliant film The Straight Story. The Straight Story is based on true episode in the life of Alvin Straight, an elderly Iowa retiree who traveled three hundred miles on a lawn mower to reconcile with his brother, who had suffered a stroke. The film is filled with many small adventures and encounters that illustrate the issue of generation gap, as well as, the challenges and dilemmas of aging. Alvin's journey consists of series of encounters with a great variety of people that present different slices of those issues. He also manages to touch most of them with his wisdom, dignity and sense of determination in spite of his poor health. One of the persons he comes across is a runaway teenager. She stops at Alvin's fireplace, and he shares his supper with her. When she reveals the reasons of her escape, the old man's smart approach strikes the viewer. Instead of criticism, the runner away is told a story about a game that Alvin used to play with his children. In this game Alvin had given each of his children a stick and asked them to break it, which they easily did. However, when he asked them to join all sticks together and try it again, none of the children was able to complete this task. Then Alvin concluded to his children that those sticks are family. After the story they go sleep. In the morning Alvin realizes that the teenage left his camping and on the fireplace he notices a bunch of fastened sticks that viewers may interpret as the teenager coming back to her family. Throughout his journey we discover additional information about Alvin's life. Most of observations that we can draw from these facts concern aging. At one point, when he is invited by a group of cyclists to their camp, Alvin is asked a question: What is the worst thing about being old? Alvin replies that the worst thing about being old is remembering when you were young. When his lawn mower breaks in Clermont, Alvin befriends a local elder. They share tragic experience from WWII, and Alvin confesses that he accidentally killed the Polish scout who served in his military unit, and also how this event shaped his life. The viewer is presented with the character of Alvin's brother and their long lasting argument, which is the main reason for setting up his \"pilgrimage\" to his place in Mount Zion. He is determined to do it on his own terms, as it is the only way to obtain his peace of mind. Alvin is well aware that the time is passing and it might be the last chance to reconcile with his brother, Lyle. When after series of mishaps and adventures he eventually reaches his brother's house, the viewer is kept in suspension as Lyle does not reply simultaneously after his brother cry. Fortunately, after few seconds we can hear Lyle's voice, the two brothers reconcile, and we can finally feel relieved. Few films have examined the issues of aging and generation gap in such a simple, honest, but at the same time arresting way. The Straight Story moves slowly, which perfectly suits the theme of the movie. The cinematography, by Freddie Francis, is evocative, and features numerous shots of corn fields ready to be razed. Both story line and cinematography depict true images of the Autumn of a man's life. The images that will stay in the viewer's memory for a long, long time.",

            "content": "There is no denying that The Straight Story is a film by David Lynch, even though it might seem far removed from anything Lynch would ever create. \nThe Straight Story is about a 73 year old man facing the fact that he is not immortal and that death could very well be upon him.  As the story opens, he is found lying on his kitchen floor.  He has been there for hours because he had fallen and there was no one to help him up.  He visits his doctor who warns him that his unhealthy lifestyle has caught up with him and that if he doesn't shape up soon things are only going to get worse.  And then, the final blow, a message about his brother, who he hasn't spoken with for several years, comes in, telling him that the man had a stroke. \nRichard Farnsworth plays title character, Alvin Straight.  He creates a stir in the small town he lives in when he decides to go an visit his brother who lives almost 300 miles away.  With no bus access, and with Alvin unable to drive a car (poor eyesight) he hitches a trailer up to his lawn mower and begins a trek across two states.  Sissy Spacek plays his daughter Rose.  While she seems to be burdened with a mental handicap, she is his caretaker and knows him better than anyone.  Yet despite her feelings about his trip, she is not able to stop him.The Straight Story is filled with David Lynch's creativity as a director. As usual, Lynch captures the essence of small town living, highlighting the quirkiness of seemingly normal circumstances.The only Lynch trademark that is missing from this film (and I can't say that I necessarily missed it) was that element of danger he brings to his films.  Here is a story about a man meeting people as he travels the back roads of Iowa.   There is no violence and nothing to be afraid of. \nThe Straight Story is very funny and at times had me laughing out loud.  But at the same time, there are several heart wrenching moments, as Alvin reveals some of the pain that he has experienced in his life.  Richard Farnsworth has been the second banana throughout his career.  His performance in this film had me wondering, \"Where has this guy been all this time?\"  Certainly Farnsworth is Oscar-bound with this role.Anyone going through a mid life crisis might find The Straight Story to be an interesting experience.  In one scene a cyclist asks Alvin \"What is the worst thing about getting old?\"  Alvin replies, \"Remembering when you were young.\"",

            "content": "Simply put, The Straight Story is the most simple movie ever done by the director who makes the most complex movies I can think. So you were confused by Lost Highway or another Lynch movie. Well, The Straight Story is the opposite. You would really have to be a complete idiot to ask to the man sitting next to you \"What happened right there, I don't get it\". The story is simple: a man who sees his death coming decides that he wants to see his brother who just had a stroke. He hasn't seen him in ten years and has lost his driver's licence. He also wants to do this by himself, so he goes on the road with his lawnmower. This is when the movie turns into one of the most beautiful road movies ever. The beautiful photography and Richard Farnsworth's performance make this simple story a beautiful one, and the rest of the cast, mostly people he meets, are also great. My only problem with the acting might be Sissy Spacek, who overdoes it a bit in her role as Alvin's daughter but nothing really bad. It is simply that alongside Farnsworth's oscar-worthy performance, she doesn't stand a chance. The Straight Story is a movie you will either love or hate. I loved it but I can understand why some would hate it: the slow pace, the lack of action... But this movie is a beautiful reflection on growing old and a movie which touches the viewer deeply. You end up really caring about this old man's quest. Now, wether you love it or hate is up to you, but please, see it!90%",

It was during the fire exercise and we see two couples who have set up as spectators to witness this sight and then we see an elderly man losing control of his tractor as he speeds helplessly down a hill. It was the look on his face that kept me from changing the channels and it was his humanity of this character that kept me mesmerized the rest of the time. Richard Farnsworth portrayal of Alvin Straight is one of the most honest performances I have seen in a long time. And true, the storyline itself does go at a very slow clip, but it is deliberate. I realized when he finally reaches his destination of why this was. It gives us a chance to experience first hand what a long journey it was for him, both physically and emotionally, and how long it can take to rectify things in our own lives. I am rarely so touched by performances and screenplays but this is a 'bible', if you will, to live by. Acts of kindness, forgiveness, humility and love propel this story to its touching and subdued climax.I intend to find a copy so I can watch it from the beginning and also to use it as a tool in my daily life to aspire to be a better human being to others and and most importantly to myself.Thank you to everyone involved in the making of this film and story.",

Brilliant. I also liked the way Lynch didn't push it over the top with emotion at the end when Alvin finally got to see Lyle. He said he was going to see Lyle, and he did. No boo-hooing or 'I'm sorry, I'm sooo sorry!'.Farnsworth puts in a well suited performance as Alvin, pulling off the humour of the story with great style, as well as the more sincere parts of the film. I'm wondering why it was only on in just about one cinema in the whole of Northern Ireland. Great stuff.",

            "content": "* * * * * (5 out of 5)\nThe Straight Story\nDirected by : David Lynch, 1999\n`Tenderness can be just as abstract as insanity\u00b4 - David LynchThe Straight Story is a movie with such a rare form of momentum and style, a methodical lyricism, that it is not only the result of a somewhat directorial restraint (this is Lynch after all), but of true, unabashed artistry and inspiration.In perfect rhythm - chugging along - Lynch takes us to the beautiful golden farm country of America's heartland as in Laurens, Iowa.\nWe engage on a seductive journey (based on a true story), the journey of one Alvin Straight, an elderly man with bad hips but a positive approach to life, who decides to make ends meet with his brother. With whom he hasn't spoken to in years. The Straight Story touches and addresses human traits such as forgiveness, humility, success and love, without ever missing a beat. You are not laughing at the movie or because of a funny scene, but because you may have been there yourself. That kind of moviemaking is not a first at all, but seldomly is it this engaging, charming or rewarding. The movie rests nicely into its own, it glitters with a kind of self reliance and plausible charm, amidst the many organic characters and lush visuals. Richard Farnsworth as Alvin Straight is endlessly endearing, while Sissy Spacek is touchingly vulnerable as his daughter.The impeccable musical score - by famous Lynch collaborator Angelo Badalamenti - a tender mix of violin, guitar and simple orchestration - is also a peak performance. Not only does it play to the movie's strengths, but adds texture and depth when not enhancing or enriching already mesmerizing visuals. When viewing this movie and as the ending draws closer, you may find yourself wondering just how exactly Lynch will round it up. Don't. Neither unwillingly celebrational nor inappropriately dark, Lynch brilliantly goes full circle : the mother lode unfolds in a fashion that I doubt any one who would have deemed otherwise.A riveting journey; one of pure and vibrant human poetry. A classic in every sense of the word, The Straight Story is an absorbing and atmospheric masterpiece. A true heartwarmer.Note : kudos for going against hindering odds : based on a true story and also produced by Disney. Normally a dangerous cocktail. However, David Lynch and his superb cast pull it off : Alvin wins you over immediately and the Disney shadow? You never even think about that for a second.",

The performances of Spacey and Wesley were outstanding; perhaps Wesley like Carrey was robbed for not being norminated. Benning performance can either be seen as over-acting or someone who is trying to make a false face for herself and a makeshift image of success. Nevertheless, after seeing Richard Farnsworth performance in 'The Straight Story' I realised that Richard deserved the oscar if it was just a race between him, Spacey and Crowe. Whereas, Spacey relied upon good camera direction and words to convey emotions, Richard went a step better just by seeing his slow movement across the screen - he didn't even have to talk to convey ideas and emotions and when he did Richard as Alvin summed up World War Two far better than three hours of 'Saving Private Ryan' could ever do. For me this is the best movie I have seen since La Vita e Bella and that was over a year ago!!! This is one of the greatest movies of all time for the following reasons: 1) The acting by all the characters were outstanding, something you cannot claim for American Beauty. 2) The storyline was more thought-provoking as it's the type you will appreciate more when you are adult enough to understand. 3) There are moral lessons here that are far superior to American Beauty.

His facial expressions and tone convey almost as much as his words, and he nicely balances the comedic and dramatic aspects of the narrative, particularly when he embarks on his trip.  The scene where he has a beer with a new friend about his age is particularly moving, as the stories and memories they share have been in the news the past few years but never discussed in this fashion.Of note also are the scenes near the film's conclusion, when he visits with some very kind people while waiting for repairs.  Without going into detail, I found them to be an almost melancholy commentary on our society, as we realize that there aren't many neighborhoods or people who are like this anymore.

Dialogue was sparse, but important, there was nothing left in there which was not needed to further the story and the philosophy of the story. The beginnings of Lynch's films are always so powerful and apparent, which sparks an interest in what follows.  The noir-esque lighting was still apparent in such scenes as when Rose and Alvin were talking about the trip.

Not once did anything inspirational or uplifting happen, let alone anything to help move the dragging storyline along. The musical score is just horrible. Well it's not bad at first, but that's all that you hear throughout the whole movie. Sissy Spacek did a horrible job with the speech impediment that her character had. Richard Farnsworth did a good job acting, but he didn't have much to work with. There isn't anyone else worth mentioning about acting, they were all very mediocre and amateur. I gave this movie a try, I really did, but it didn't live up to the hype. If you're still interested in seeing the movie, I suggest you watch the trailer, it shows all the best parts of the movie anyway. I give it a 1, yes a 1, out of 10.",

THE STRAIGHT STORY is a slight one, its characters unassuming and its tone decidedly muted. If you can de-accelerate down to the film's slow tempo, you'll be rewarded with moments of quiet profundity. Though generally derided even by those who like the film, Farnsworth's scenes with the pregnant runaway are deeply touching: his analogy of a lone individual as a twig easily snapped, a family as a bundle of sticks tied tightly together and near-unbreakable, is a lovely moment that embodies the film's understated virtues. A beautiful Badalamenti score aids director Lynch immeasurably in achieving these grace notes, as does the sweeping imagery captured by cinematographer Francis. Farnsworth's face - a tintype of a vanished America - almost makes appraisals of his performance superfluous. While it's hard to say if THE STRAIGHT STORY would work the same magic on the second or third viewing, seeing it once in the properly attentive frame of mind should be enough to leave you with an indelible memory of it.",

The flick is slow-paced, and the combination of some mild community members and passers-by gave the old man what he needed to complete the journey.

The film moves slowly, but deliberately, as Lynch demonstrates the power of silence. Angelo Badalamenti's score complements the film perfectly. The cinematography is unusual but is never distracting. The character development is outstanding, and the biggest surprise of all: the dialog is very strong and very intelligent.

Alvin didn't want to leave his brother in those terms, so he felt the need to meet him, the problem was he lived in Mount Zion, WI, and Alvin didn't have a driver license. So Alvin prepares his lawn-mower and starts his 390km trip in a 8km/h vehicle. He went anyway. The whole movie shows the many events that occurred in his long trip. Alvin Straight did in fact exist and also did this trip. Unfortunately died two years later and so did Richard Farnsworth. For them both I'll give a word of respect and applause. Alvin Straight, who's did we only understand from a 112 minute video but it's what it takes just to understand he had the most right notion of value. Richard Farnsworth, one of the late 20th century best actors whose roles shall not be forgotten. Although great deeds and great men provide great productions, the Straight Story is very simple but it doesn't lose any of its epic aspects. From this movie you will keep in mind his words. Deep, wise and meaningful. Obviously it ain't David Lynch's common job but it turns out quite an interesting movie. 8/10",

            "content": "`Disney Pictures is about to release a G-rated moralistic family picture by director David Lynch'.This press report caused an almost immediate hassle between the positive side of my personality and the side that likes to be referred to as `Realistic'. Since fortune favors the bold, Mr. Realistic took hold of the mike first and stated: `Think about it. 1990 was THE year for Mr. Lynch. The first season of the mini-series 'Twin Peaks' was popular to the extreme; his motion picture 'Wild at Heart' won the palm d'Or in cannes; his video for Chris Isaak's song 'Wicked Game' a chart topper; and calvin Klein got Lynch to make a series of commercials for his new Obsession perfume. Then came the clouds as the second season of Twin Peaks lost a lot of viewers, who simply had enough (a result of modern culture where we are like children, who stubbornly MUST eat a box of candy in one sitting and wonder afterwards they we got sick of it); the motion picture sequel Fire Walk With Me was booed at in Cannes and a world wide box office failure; his new TV-series On the Air and Hotel Room couldn't raise interest. After a silence of more than five years, Lynch returned to the silver screen with the motion picture Lost Highway. An intriguing film to be sure, but there were few positive reviews and a lot of people were disappointed. Mr. Realistic, whose speaking can always be somewhat exhausting and who often get caught in the moment, sighed and paused, thinking about how to put it. `In the beginning of 1999, Lynch tried it once more on the small screen with Mulholland Drive, but this time it didn't even get the chance to reach audiences as producing network ABC passed on the pilot. Lynch isn't a stupid man, so he starts thinking: 'It's been almost ten years since I had my last hits. The millenium is almost over and if I want to end it successfully, I've got to act fast.'  So, less than two years after his latest film, Lynch returns to the silver screen with a based-on-fact family picture about an old farmer road-tripping through the country. How can you possibly make an interesting picture with such a premise? This film's gonna be a sweet as sugar piece of corny and moralistic rubbish. Hence, positive reviews and oscar-nominations are almost secured. Hence, it becomes interesting (and save) again to invest in a guy like Lynch.'  At this point, Mr. Positive (who doesn't even want to be called `Mister') claimed the mike. `A director is more than the story he tells', he stated. `A director is the pace, the directing of the camera, the directing of the actors, the whole atmosphere. Besides, Lynch isn't a cold, emotionless creature. Blue velvet as well as Wild At Heart and Fire Walk With me contained dramatic, sensitive moments filled with love. Lynch isn't a David Cronenberg - He cares about his characters. And The Straight Story isn't Lynch's first 'normal' film, he gained interest with the acclaimed The Elephant Man.' Mr. Realistic, bold as ever, grabbed the mike for a moment and yelled; `Yeah, that other 'normal' film he made at a point in his career when he didn't have one.'.  Mr. Positive shook his head (because of both Mr. Realistic's bold character and what he said), but since he didn't have an other argument ready, he decided to end this first discussion by suggesting to take a look at the film first before judging it.The beginning of The Straight Story takes place in Lynch-county, alright. We hear the music of Angelo Badalamenti, rather peaceful this time around; we see quiet, dreamy images of a small town. These images remind us of Blue velvet, but, as the music already suggested, we stay on the surface this time. If there is vermin in the grass, Lynch isn't interested this time around. Mr. Positive scored (if you can regard a discussion as a competition, that is) leading with 1-0.  Indeed, the images (photographed by Freddie Francis) are obviously created by Lynch. The dreamy atmosphere, the slow pace and the humor are clearly his, too. And this film isn't all that peaceful, either. There are a lot of ominous shadows and the scene where Spacek watches out of the window one night and sees a young boy picking up a ball is scarier than those rope-jumping girls from Wes Craven's Nightmare on Elmstreet. But, after having played a poor first round, Mr. Realistic made a comeback. His opportunity knocked when the film ironically appeared to collapse when Alvin actually started his journey. `Well well well, Mr. Realistic cried out. `And For the first time since his first film Eraserhead, Lynch manages to keep the running time under the 120 minutes. How could that have happened?'Screenwriters John Roach and Mary Sweeney had to come up with stuff to 1. prevent the movie from becoming a one-man show. 2. Keep the story going. 3. keep balance to the story. To put it in another way: if nothing happens on the way, no film. Problem is that Roach and Sweeney didn't come up with enough anecdotes, resulting in a screenplay that shows the same ups and downs as the road Alvin is travelling down. Some of Alvin's happenings are strong and interesting (his story about W.O. II; the speeding down the hill; the small talk with the bartender), some comical (the encounter with the lady who accidentally keeps hitting deers with her car), some simple and serene (the passing bicycle-rally), others simple don't work, lead to nowhere, are corny or obvious (the scene on the camping ground; the talk with the girl who ran away from home). And every scene where really something happens is followed by long shots of the scenery and Farnsworth on his lawnmower, riding off to his next 'anecdote'. To summarize: there's a lack of evenness. Not only in pace and storytelling but also in quality. Fortunately, the last scene, in which Alvin reaches his brother Lyle, is not only the strongest one in the film but also one of the strongest in Lynch's whole oeuvre. There's barely any dialogue here, but Lynch proves once again that facial expressions and silence can say more than a thousand words ever could. So, Mr. Positive won after all, although it was a close call. As Marge Simpson once pointed out, bad winners exist, so Mr. Positive decided not to go on about the other winning expects of this film, like the brilliant acting by all concerned; the breathtaking cinematography by 80 year old Freddie Francis; and the courage of Lynch to, in this day and age, make a film about a elderly farmer on a 5 miles an hour vehicle (remember that wonderful emphasizing scene, messing with an audience's expectation, in which the camera follows the lawnmower, then tilts up to the sky to hold a few moments before tilting down again to show that the lawnmower has only progressed a couple of yards?). The Straight story is not a perfect film, but it IS wonderful and clearly a sincere piece of work, a labor of love.O yes, since fame favors the bold, Mr. Realistic was likely to have last word, anyway. Sneaking back to the mike for one last time, grinning sadistically, to point out a situation that has probably occurred a number of times. `Imagine, if you will, Pa and Ma Average, just having seen The Straight Story with cute little daughter Shirley and intending to see more films of 'that nice Mr. Lynch'. So, they go to the local Blockbuster and rent Blue Velvet. 'Gee, how come we never heard of this title before?'. Pa and Ma, settle down in front of the Zenith with their little daughter Shirley snug as a bug between them, hit the play button and are, once again, confronted with happy imagery of small town America. 'Look mommy', little Shirley chuckles, 'That fireman is waving at us.' Pa and Ma Average smile at each other. Ain't life the best? Then, the camera lingers into the grass and little Shirley's face becomes pale as a sheet. 'Don't you $@#&&* look at me!!'  Ha ha ha!'7.5 out of 10.",

The entire film has been journeying towards the meeting with Lyle Straight, so it really takes you aback when the person to shamble out of the shack is not \"Lyle Straight\", but actor Harry Dean Stanton. Stanton looks NOTHING like Richard Farnsworth -- he's dark and swarthy to Farnsworth's ruddy and snow-haired. Lyle also doesn't look anywhere near Alvin's age (though surprisingly Stanton was born only 6 years after Farnsworth, in 1926).Lynch loves to re-use a stable of actors, and since no other major roles in this film utilize his favorite actors, perhaps he felt he needed to make up for it by casting Stanton. I think it was a major mistake, however, since it wrenches the viewer out of the world of the movie at the worst time. Just a theory, but I bet if Jack Nance (may he rest in peace) had still been alive, Lynch would have cast him as Lyle Straight. Nance appeared in all of Lynch's films until his death, and would have been able to pull off the role even better than Stanton, and had the advantage of looking MUCH more like Farnsworth. It's truly a shame he wasn't given that opportunity.",

It made my eyes well up more than any film I can remember, and that's hard to do. Richards Farnsworth's performance as the old geezer Alvin Straight is nothing short of Oscar-worthy. So nice to see that someone in this world still dares to tell a story where cheap dramatic thrills are not present. Any other scriptwriter or director would have thrown in the robbing of Alvin, or how young would have trashes his trailer or beat him up to create \"drama, conflict\" (like they learned in filmschool). None of that here, and I'm so happy that was the case. Truly a straight story. Alvin encounters friendly people, just like in reality. It also reminded me about my trips to America: this film truly shows the greatness of America and its people, not everyone is a gun carrying NRA maniac. And the slow pacing is also completely deliberate and justified in this film, since Alvin is an old man and life to him move at a slower pace. His 7 week lawnmover ride to see his ailing brother, is just not only a trip on a machine out of nescessity, the time it takes is also a wayfor Alvin to \"swallow his pride\" as he says, to be able to make peace with his brother before he dies. Great, great stuff. Without a shadow of a doubt, the best film of '99.",

He decides (and at every point in the film his own name reverberates through his actions) to put a few things straight.Alvin is, by this time in his life, a man of great experience but modest means.

Early on in the film, we begin to understand that this is an ambitious journey, which no elderly gentleman of Alvin's age should reasonably undertake.But along the way, we slowly learn how Alvin has so many qualifications which equip him to achieve his unlikely objective. His objective is very simple and straightforward. His brother is ill and likely to die and he wants to visit him. He has had a falling out with him many years ago and they have not spoken in a very long time.Along the way, Alvin meets many people. The way he behaves towards them and the benefit they get from having known him is the essence of this film. We come to know who Alvin Straight is, from what Alvin Straight does. And at the end of the film, we know who we are .. better.",

            "content": "The best thing I can say about this film is its very close to my heart. The first time I saw it, it left such a profound impact on me that I can never forget. The film is based on the true story of Alvin Straight's 1994 journey across Iowa and Wisconsin on a lawnmower. The character of Alvin Straight is portrayed realistically by late actor Richard Farnsworth. Sissy Spacek plays the role of his daughter, a kind woman with an intellectual disability. It is a road trip movie, plainly speaking. During the journey, he meets various people and shares his experiences and moments from his life with them. All the characters in the movie are surprisingly kind which is rare to see in movies today. Under the surface, it is about growing old, family bond, loss, suffering, mistakes, promises, and human kindness. The ending is just perfect and gives the required closure to the story.The story was brought to life by a master and my favorite filmmaker, David Lynch. No one could have done it better than him. The cinematography is beautiful and captures the beauty and simplicity of the American countryside which we rarely see in American films. The screenplay was written by John Roach and Mary Sweeney, which is the strength of the film and contains realistic dialogues. The highlight of this movie is the score composed by Angelo Badalamenti. The music is sublime and transports you to the countryside.The movie gives the message of showing kindness to strangers and caring for your family. The plot might sound too heavy and emotional, but trust me it's not. The movie is not overly sentimental and truer in showcasing real people and emotions, however, it will make you teary-eyed. I have seen the movie multiple times, alone and with my family. It is a family movie but can also be appreciated by the youth.",

            "content": "One of the great keys to telling a great story on film lies in not what is said and done, but often what isn't. The Straight Story is exactly that: a story about sticking to the essentials of story telling and leaving out anything extra.  It is so promising that this film was made even at all. All too often, Film makers treat their audiences like idiots and feel that every motivation, thought and reaction must be dictated through rapid editing, snappy one-liners, super stunts and CGI effects all set to a blaring soundtrack. The Straight Story is a movie about quiet truths and requires the audience to fill in the blanks.  Fine case in point: in the film, Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) listens to a woman vent about running over deer. As she screeches off in her compact car, Alvin simply stares down at the deer. Usually, the filmmaker will insist upon some quick quip that comments on the action and the character, but not here. We simply move on to see Straight cooking a piece of venison over a campfire while being stared at by deer molded lawn sculpture. There are many other sequences just like that in this rich film.  Sissy Spacek, Richard Farnsworth and the rest of the cast give fully fleshed out and three dimensional characters. The film is quietly moving without the slightest hint of sentimental seasoning. Thank you David Lynch for creating a genuine work of American Film Art.  A 10 out of 10.",

However before that it had been 4 or 5 times I had that pleasure and it's just now when I decided to comment. The straight story is the tale about the journey to the beginning. Well , they say that childhood comes two times in life. Once in the first years of life and another at the end of the life, off course if you're lucky enough to reach old age. But that's not the childhood i want to talk about, but the thing around the childhood, cause that's the time when you're i guess \"Truest\" of all. And you are also part of family, part of what gave you a birth and what in fact you are. And all the family members are part of you. But then comes the time when you go away, you become a little bit stranger. However when you become old you want to rejoin your roots. And that's what Straight Story's magic is. Alvin Straight is making journey through the beautiful landscapes of America but also he's making journey to the past , and that past is future, and both of them are the combining parts of that \"Truest\". And what Alvin does on the road is just to share everything he learned during his life with people who still have time to go that road. Straight story has the most natural philosophy of all. Here are neither suffered Bergmanic faces talking about the deep spiritual emptiness, nor the half smiling Godaric faces talking about the meaning of life in metro. Here everything is clear, everything comes to the surface and that's what makes the movie a masterpiece. Lynchs dynamic a little bit bleak directing, Badalamenti's masterful score and photographer's outstanding work off course are also in business. I do really think that it's the greatest Lynch film ever. And probably the best picture of all 90's.",

Not one comment says anything about recognizing older people in Alvin. His character is so vivid I can smell him.

Harry Dean Stanton has only one line, but it's possibly the most touching as well. But still the best part is the film's script; it's just incomprehensibly good.

For typical moviegoers, this gem of a movie could seem unbearably ploddy; but its great beauty and depth are revealed through its pacing, when one is able to breathe with it and let reflection and thoughtfulness rule rather than the need to be entertained. The first scene sets up what will be the flow and tempo of the rest of the film. Silently and without music, the camera seems to move at super slow-motion as it zooms in on Rose's house and yard, then her neighbor as she settles into her lounge chair to sun herself. No added drama or orchestral flourishes, just real life. That's how the movie unfolds to its end. It is acted superbly and with great humanity by Richard Farnsworth (who died just a year later) as Alvin Straight and also by Sissy Spacek as his slightly retarded daughter Rose. It's a compelling and true story of a 73 year old man who drove over 300 miles from Iowa to Wisconsin on a John Deere lawn mower hitched to a trailer in order to try to reconcile with his estranged brother, who had suffered a stroke. Along the way, he meets a number of people, some of whom aid him in the long trek as his tractor breaks down, and others with whom he shares the wisdom of 73 years of living, and his own mistakes and failures. Especially moving is his conversation with another World War II veteran as they remember their harrowing experiences and the heartbreaking loss of their comrades. Throughout the entire movie, Lynch retains his focus and ability to keep things simple and unaffected. Some of the scenes are set up so naturally and organically, one feels as if they've stumbled onto the real event or conversation as it was taking place. This is my favorite kind of movie-making, because it allows the viewers to come their own conclusions and experience their own emotions without ever telling them how they should feel. I've seen the film twice and it has made me cry both times, both for its truthfulness and resolve, and for Farnsworth's incredible portrayal.

But if you go to the countryside you meet people like Alvin everywhere, they might not use a lawn-mower, but they are not that much different.

In one sense it's hard to believe that this G rated film is created by the same director that brought us Blue Velvet, but look again.  The film itself has David Lynch's trademark style and sound, and he obviously loves to take on small Midwestern Americana.  It has a lyrical quality about it that held my interest throughout, occasionally bring dampness to the eyes with Farnsworth's homespun wisdom and stories.

            "content": "Beyond the contents of the film, the most interesting thing is, that it is a David Lynch movie. There are questions: Have we seen here his future as a film maker? Did the message of \"The Straight Story\" already appear on the underground of his earlier work? Did he become schizophrenic? I've heard, that his wife urged him to use a material, that she had found in a newspaper, as a screen-play. At least a likable trait. But my prophecy is, that the friendly spirit of this movie will take influence later on... We'll see! I can understand the people, who found fault with the film's slowness. That's not my point. I had some difficulties with the episode structure, because not every episode is (can be) as strong as the war veteran talk in the middle of the film. The scenes in the biker camp, for example, have no urgency. I am old, you are young,  o.k., and what else? At the other hand, it works, that this wise old man uses to speak in \"sentences\" (I can't say it in English, in German it's \"Sinnsprueche\" or \"Sentenzen\", \"Schiller-Sprache\"). He is our teacher for life, and the spectator submits willingly to the role as his student. The acting is superb, but Sissy Spacek is spectacular. For her autistic Rose I give thousands of Dustin Hoffmans. Ambivalent is the effect of the Badalamenti-music, in the road-movie-scenes ist fantastic, in the emotional moments (the campfire-scene with the pregnant runaway) it is unfortunately sentimental rubbish. What a distance to the true emotionality and the loving spirit between the moved brothers at the end of the film!... It's a good Seven for me.",

            "content": "***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** The Straight Story director David Lynch, has usually been seen as the envoy of the avant-garde in Hollywood, his characters in his films are usually outcasts from society. He is best known for taking audiences into a mysterious almost dreamlike state during a film, just like Mulholland Drive (2001) - but The Straight Story does not fit into his previous desires. From the outset the story sounds ridiculous. A 73 year old man known as Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth), is a small community man living in a small stereotypical mid-west town, where of course nothing interesting really ever happens! Alvin Straight becomes determined to see his elderly brother Lisle (Harry Dean Stanton) who he hasn't spoken to in ten years. Rose (Sissy Spacek), Alvin's daughter conveys the message to Alvin that his brother has recently had a bad stroke, and Alvin is deeply shocked by the news of his brother's sudden illness. Despite news from a doctor regarding his own poor health, Alvin becomes determined to travel 300 miles to visit his brother, he says sentimentally `A brother is a brother.' So what?, we might think, but the twist to the story is that he intends to make this journey on the back of a ride-on lawnmower! To use a lawnmower to travel 300 miles was proof of Alvin's stubbornness, courage and determination. He doesn't have a driving license, he dislikes travelling on buses, he's short of cash, and he will not be driven there.On his travels, he meets a variety of different characters, such as a young girl runaway, a group of old age tourists, an hysterical woman, and World War II veterans. On arrival in his destination, Mt. Zion, and after six weeks of breakdowns, unforgettable characters, and the despair of his daughter Rose, he finally sees his brother and the pair are reunited together - everything seems complete once more.The Straight Story, is a very heart-warming, affectionate and sentimental film. Alvin Straight's determination to defy age, his dauntlessness, his courage to travel for six weeks to see his brother  -makes him worthy of at least some admiration. Also, you feel a sense of warmth about Sissy Spacek's character, Rose. Her inability to communicate effectively, her slowness, makes her a loveable and humorous. Through the use of various characters, the use of high camera angles, and the beautiful mid-west autumn harvest scenery make you feel a part of the film. The Straight Story is one of those Sunday afternoon films something they'd put on instead of another 1970s version of Columbo. A film your Gran, favourite Aunt, or mother would enjoy, just because its nice to watch - and there's no gory violence or sex. It's back to the days when films were moral and sentimental, or full of old characters just dying to reminisce about the good old days - just because they were good, it's similar in a way to The Whales of August (1987). Perhaps even to make you feel happier as a person, rather than shock you, as most films arguably do today. The only criticism I would have is that the great Academy Awards winning actress Sissy Spacek, disappears from the film after about thirty minutes, and she hardly appears much after that. She's only seen again when Alvin phones home to tell Rose he's fine after five weeks on the road! Wasn't she worried at all? What daughter in her right mind would let her Dad make such a  journey? Its a shame the film doesn't explore her character more, as we only hear brief stories of her past, it never really mentions why she has learning difficulties, and what she must be truly feeling because her Dad has gone? David Lynch argued that there is no one best scene in The Straight Story, he says that, `Its like music, every note (scene) is important.' If we wanted to choose the best scene, the scene where Alvin arrives in Mt. Zion and goes to a bar and has a beer for the first time in a long time - his sense of achievement is clearly shown here. Overall, The Straight Story is slow, nostalgic, highly backward looking, showing emotions of the human heart. Mothers would love you for taking them to see it, because it's a splendid, sensitive to need kind of movie. Those who find reminiscing, nostalgia, old people, no sex and violence all a bit dull - well just don't bother.",

A simple true tale about an arthritic lawnmower man named Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth), the G-rating and overall pure goodness of the film automatically lends itself to gooey sentimentalism, but it triumphs for being eerie when it could have easily been dull, heartfelt when it could have been trite.And the director does not go unnoticed: the small-town aesthetic, the opening and closing shots of outer space and, of course, the deer lady, all make for a quintessential Lynch-ing experience. Together with Angelo Badalamenti's spooky score and Freddie Francis's sumptuous cinematography, this is one of the greatest American filmmaking accomplishments of 1999.",

But what can you expect from a movie about a man taking a trip across a few US states on a lawnmower ( it's hard to imagine Jan de Bont making an exiting \"Speed 3\" about this subject). I really enjoyed the film, though at times it's a bit sentimental and a bit moralistic about \"Great American Values\". It starts off by giving you the impression this is another David Lynch film about small town America, and the dark secrets that are hidden under it's surface ( Blue Velvet, Twin Peeks), with the typical bright Lynch shots and broody Angelo Badelamenti music, but then takes a completely different turn to the story about one man and his lawnmower on a quest to pay his brother one last visit. The result is another Lynch roadmovie ( Wild at Heart), and probably the slowest roadmovie that was, and will ever be made. Lynch plays around a bit with the conventions of his own style. For example: do you remember the shots of the white lines on the asfalt that go by at a very high speed during the nocturnal ride in Dennis Hoppers car in Blue Velvet? The same shot returns in this film, by daylight, and at the speed of a lawnmower!",

I grew up in Chicago, but my father is from California, and when I was little we used to drive out there and back every summer to see relatives.  We usually took Interstate 80, which goes through central Iowa.  Those fields and that that endless sky are my landscape, and 'The Straight Story' captures them perfectly.  If you think that the Midwest isn't beautiful, see this film.'The Straight Story' is not for young children, however; the fact that it received a G rating in the U.S., and the equivalent of same in several other countries, suggests once again that the values and priorities of the Motion Picture Association of America and its sister agencies are grossly misplaced.

I've heard it said that it's hard to believe that he made this film.  Hogwash, says I.  From its opening images of patterns of fields being mowed to the isolated shots of a small Americana town and a factory building puffing up smoke in the background, we know we are in Lynchian territory, which captures something special the way a photograph or a painting can (and, not surprisingly, Lynch is prolific at both).A large woman on a small chair sits out on her lawn sunning herself.  She goes inside, gets her cupcakes and potato chips, and sits back down in the chair, murmuring happy noises to herself.  It's Lynchian, and somewhat grotesque, but it achieves what `Gummo' aspired to do at times: to capture the fact that life is beautiful and strange, filled with illusions \u0096 but it *is* beautiful if you take the time to really look at it.  (The hero appropriately moves at five miles an hour.)For my money, David Lynch makes some of the most *realistic* films ever made about the American experience.  I often find that the films which tap into genuine and universal realism are often the most surreal, because it taps into something which can only be skimmed on the surface through naturalism.Lynch has always been a master at this, and here he achieves it through a poetic lyricism that has always been there in his work, only now it's the center.* * * * for The Straight Story.",

However, if one reads the credits carefully, one will notice that it was underwritten by Canal+, a French company, and that there were French co-producers.  Its essence is European, although the settings, tone and mood are essentially Mid-Western America. Its concern is the human condition, that we get old, and infirm and we die. And that we must take care to make amends for the brutality of life, because the universe is so much greater and more beautiful than we are. There is only one gun visible in this picture, when Alvin shoots his first and unworthy lawn mower.  It is slow, much slower than American movie goers have been trained to tolerate; elegiac, utterly alien to the the shoot-em-up, blow-em-up thesis of most internationally marketed American movies.  The scene with Alvin and his chance encounter with another WW II veteran is one of the most heartbreaking scenes in current cinema and is a poignant warning of what we are about to do in the current geopolitical climate. It is also a reminder of the finest aspects of the American soul - caring, compassion, kindliness, neighborliness.  Farnsworth and Spacek are superb. It made me mourn Farnsworth's death, and gave me even greater respect for Spacek, whom I adore as one of the finest actors and human beings in America.",

Are you completely meshugah???\"The beauty of The Straight Story is that it is simultaneously pedestrian yet compelling.  It works because it neither plays into nor overplays its material.  It's a classic \"real frog in the magic garden\" story about an ordinary person dealing with extraordinary, but not outlandish, circumstances.Freddie Francis' gorgeous photography, Lynch's laid-back direction and Richard Farnsworth's fantastic treatment of Alvin Straight tell a compelling \"less is more\" Odyssey-style zen-filled tale.  It's not light viewing -- there are no rapid intercuts or quick payoffs -- but bear with the low-key pacing, because this picture really earns its dramatic moments, unlike the oversentimentalized schmaltz of \"Forrest Gump\" or \"The Cider House Rules\".This movie, in a sense, is the antithesis of Fargo.  Fargo and The Straight Story share the same setting, but unexpectedly, Lynch never devolves into treating rural midwesterners as sinister caricatures like one would expect based on his previous work.  Neither does he nor do his writers, Roach & Sweeney, fall into the trap of Disney-fying the story.

But with The Straight Story, I've begun to think that maybe the man was worthy of all the praise heaped on him a decade ago. True the movie does contain some of his trademark drawn-out shots that bored me to tears in his other work, but here they fit the mood of the film. One user has questioned the believability of Mr. Straight making the trip in two months on a lawn mower when he could have done it in a couple hours on a plane. I don't know what the real Mr. Straight's motivation was for making the trip in the way he did (maybe he was afraid of flying, who knows) but in the movie, it is a journey of atonement. Hopping on a plane or in a car wouldn't have absolved him of his sins in his brother's eyes, only the most difficult and demeaning journey could mend their relationship.All and all this is an excellent movie.

I heard that they got him to unretire to be in this movie, and thank God they did.  I can't imagine anyone else playing this part.About the only drawback is in the dialog taking place in the long shots. Some of it was very hard to hear and understand.  A film like this should be expected to attract an older audience and if any of them have a hearing problem, this could be a major distraction.There was a large crowd in the theater with me today, (all ages) and they all seemed to enjoy it and applauded at the end.  I wish we had more family pictures like this one.  It shows that you really can enjoy a movie without the bad language or graphic sex.  Good for you, David Lynch",

            "review_title": "Wonderful, uplifting movie in this horrid post-hurricane life!! (2006)",
            "content": "This movie is an odd turn for David Lynch: Rated G, no violence, no language, no complicated twists.This is the true (!!) story of Alvin Straight, a real-life Iowan who, in the 1990s at age 76, set out on a journey of hundreds of miles...on a 1966 John Deere mower. Straight had not spoken to his brother, Lyle, in 10 years. When Lyle suffered a stroke, Alvin decided that it was time to make amends, for he had long forgotten what had made him angry with his brother, who lived in Wisconsin. Alvin's eyes were too bad to permit him to drive, and he didn't trust public transportation, so he rigged up his mower with a trailer and several weeks worth of supplies, and headed out. He drove days, and camped nights in cornfields.Veteran actor Richard Farnsworth is TOTALLY, TOTALLY EXCELLENT as Alvin Straight. He is warm, wise, compelling, patient, kind. He is clear-cut, simple in his delivery. He makes you feel like he's enveloping you in sunny warmth as he imparts bits of wisdom to you, or tells you a tale. This guy is really genuine. He did win a Best Actor nomination for his performance.Along the way, his character comes across an interesting assortment of strangers, several of whom are sort of typical \"weird\" David Lynch out-of-left-field characters...yet who all have a strange degree of compassion, for David Lynch folk. (There are no sexually violent psychopaths, for example.) This movie could have been full of maudlin clich\u00e9s about family, life experience, old age, war--but all topics are approached just perfectly, with the best choice of words. During Alvin's encounters with these various originals, you pause for a moment to reflect on your own life and values.Different layers of Alvin's life are unfolded slowly before you during his conversations, each a little gift you unwrap. There's his daughter, Rose (Sissy Spacek), with whom he lives, who is thought to be mentally retarded but in fact has a speech impediment. There's a secret he's carried since WWII. There are just factoids here and there about his life, all told in such an interesting fashion. Each person with whom he interacts similarly reveals interesting aspects of his/her life, like an exchange of presents. David Lynch beautifully demonstrates the slowness of the journey without being tedious, through breathtaking Iowa landscapes. You feel like Straight is just taking his trip one day at a time, not trying to force it. The whole time you're really rooting for him to make it to his brother's house \"in time\", yet you also feel like if his brother isn't there, you won't consider the journey wasted or fruitless.This movie was really uplifting in this time of hurricane-related misery. It made me feel like there are many out there with plenty to offer in terms of unconditional love, random acts of kindness, good advice. You just have to make it your duty to find them. I love this film, and think Richard Farnsworth was a perfect choice for the lead.I think religious moviegoers will like this movie, too, because there's no cursing, and there's a lot about family, friends, and kindness in this flick.",

Here is not represented the disgust of man but only good people, kind and cutlery. The Straight Story is not a dark film but a very slow and quiet road movie. It is shot and performed very well, and the photography is also great but this film does not convince me, it seems that there is no Lynch touch.

The characters are everyday people and thus, they are believable. The performances are good and the final scene was incredibly touching. Everyone who has a sibling can relate to it.

            "content": "The beauty of 'The Straight Story' is that of the calm, quiet and slow paced nature of it. The film follows the story of Alvin Straight as he journeys across from Iowa to Wisconsin on a John Deere lawnmower. It begins with Alvin and his daughter Rose discovering that Alvin's brother, Lyle, had a stroke. Alvin then begins a six week journey in which he encounters various people all while traveling at four miles per hour on a lawnmower. We, the audience, get to sit back and relax to one of the heartwarming tales to be shown on film. Directed by David Lynch, this movie came a bit unawares. It did receive positive reviews but is very rarely talked about nowadays. I believe this is one of the most underrated films I have every seen. The film is about as slow paced as the speed of Straight's lawnmower yet it is a beautiful journey as you see the people he meets including a runaway hitchhiker, a woman who claims to kill multiple dear a week and an old man who recalls some tales from the war. Every time a new person is introduced, we learn more and more about Alvin's life before we get a beautifully heartwarming ending that ties everything together. Absolutely incredible performances by every actor notably Sissy Spacek who gives a wonderful supporting performance. I cannot understand why this movie did not get more attention than it did. If you want a beautiful story with an incredible underlying message, look no further. Bear in mind, it is very slow-paced but it never drags and always stays on to of its game. A masterpiece. Thank you Mr. Lynch.",

Then another 10% was just spent on photographing the road itself, double and single yellow lines and white lines, and various wheels turning on the road.  There is no story except what we are told: 73-year-old man rides his mower from Iowa to Wisconsin to visit his ailing brother.  Some of the people he meets on the way are fairly amusing, but we don't have a chance to get to know them.  In any case, they don't seem to be that interesting.I know that this film has been well-received by many people, but I just don't see it.  There were a couple of touching moments at the beginning, but for the remaining time I kept thinking that I \"should\" be liking it more than I was.

            "content": "Being a huge David Lynch fan, I couldn't wait to see this. For the most part, I wasn't disappointed.First off, let me say two things: First of all, I'm 16, which proves not all teenagers demand rapid-fire editing and loud explosions (just most of them). Second of all, everyone thinks it's \"weird\" for Lynch to direct a film like this, but I don't think so. They always say \"Oh, but his films are so mean and cruel, he never pays attention to charcters, blah blah blah...\". Um, have you even bothered to see Blue Velvet or Twin Peaks? TP in particular is filled with great characters who evolve and grow and are fleshed out as the series goes on. Plus, he's no stranger to leisurely paces used to build atmosphere. Eraserhead does it beautifully, and one only has to watch the title sequence for Twin Peaks to see this talent in action. He has a real knack for creating a place that seems real.So with that out of the way, the movie: It's great. Alvin Straight is a 73 year-old man who's brother has a stroke, so he drives out on a riding mower to see him. Period. That's it. There's plenty more to it, of course, but it none of it involves the basic plot...the real treasures are hiding in the corners and the background. The film gets off to a wonderful beginning, with a loooooong tracking shot through a back yard. We finally end up in front of a window, and the shot is held for a while. Then we hear someone inside fall. Perfect. Another little treat that will pass by viewers is that in most road movies there's a shot of the highway, flying past the camera. Here we get the same shot, except it's crawlling by at 5 miles per hour. There's also a shot of a reverend leaving a house in a cemetery (is it a funeral home or what?) that looks like Lynch is going into a dream sequence. But he isn't...it's just finding a surreal beauty in everyday things, something that anyone familiar with his photos can attest to.The real star of the film, though, is Richard Farnsworth. Denzel Washington was good, Kevin Spacey was good, but Farnsworth acchieves one of the best performances of the decade. Strong words, I know, but I stand by it. There are two important things about what makes a great performance, and they are subtlety and believability. Farnsworth achieves both. To imagine anyone else as the character would be impossible. At first he's just your loveable stubborn Southern coot, but later when you look at his face you always know what he's thinking about. He speaks in a slow drawl that sounds like every word is chosen ahead of time. He is not slow, just very weary, and very very tired. The best scene in the entire movie (besides the ending) is an astounding scene in a bar in which he and another man trade WWII stories. To watch is face while he tells the story leaves you absolutely spellbound. You can almost see the pain inside. This scene alone should have cemented his prize, but to no avail.I have only two complaints. First of all, I love it when directors take the time to establish a setting and atmosphere...but only to a certain point. This film crosses that line a little. There's only so much corn one can take. The other thing is the scenes where Alvin spouts advice to people he meets, teaching them valuable lessons. It's just much much too blunt for Lynch. It could have been handled more realistically, but instead it comes off as preaching...is this a movie or an episode of Seventh Heaven?But those are small complaints. The ending is without a doubt one of the best and most perfect I've ever seen, and I've seen a LOT of movies. To watch these two actors sit and you can literally see the weight lifting from their shoulders...it's beautiful. Two lines of dialogue never sounded so right.See it. Now.",

            "content": "Obviously, the enfant terrible under America' s most popular Independent directors had the urge to slow down after closing the doors to the \"Twin Peaks\"- era with \"Lost Highway\". Although, none of his fans really should have been surprised of the fact that David Lynch' s newest movie is anything else than a tour de farce through the dark sides of life. After spending nearly a decade to explain to the public his philosophy on how evil spirits interfere with our lives and corrupt our emotions, Lynch proves that he still has the ability to tell a straight story. We can find all the elements for which he is admired by both - his critics and his supporters even in \"The Straight Story\", but this time they all serve a greater purpose - to tell a story about life we all can relate to on multiple levels. \"The Straight Story\" tells the simplistic true tale of a 73-year-old World War II veteran who despite his own physical disabilities drives almost 600 miles to reunite with his long hated brother who had a minor stroke.Alvin Straight isn't the most talkative guy. Throughout the whole movie we learn little about his motives, but we can guess - he fears that after all this years they haven' t even spoke a word on the phone with each other the time of forgiveness may just slip by. As he states himself, for him it is not only a matter of visiting an ill relative, it is a journey against his own pride. A way to use his natural stubbornness for a good cause. On his way he meets all the usual Lynchian characters like the \"Deer Lady\" who almost every day roadkills a deer in an almost deserted area. \"Where did they come from?\", she yells at Alvin who can not answer her question, but is certainly happy that he finally got some variety for dinner. Days later he will be confronted with to mechanic twins who - as almost everybody in this movie - speak in slow motion and act with such a gratitude as if they were messengers from a distant, mystical land. One of the men is wearing a big band-aid on his chin as if it would be part of his personal identity, and of course, the twins do everything else than look alike. That is Lynchs trademark - to present seemingly normal peoiple with disturbing, abnormal behavioral patterns. Lynch even manages it to employ his \"Twin Peaks\"- personnel (like Everett McGill as lawnmower seller Tom) in thoughtful cameo appearances. But none of the actors, not even the hilarious Sissy Spacek as mental disabled daughter Rose, can take anything away from the grace of Richard Farnsworth most impressing performance. It is his certainty which makes this movie so remarkable. And it his stoic reaction to these absurd people he meets which makes the movie both - so wise and funny. Lynch uses Straights real-life story as a metaphor for a life he and his previous movie characters are longing for. A life without violence. A life in peace. A quiet life. Still, even Alvin has to fight his demons - the ghosts of his World War II experiences, and their haunting images once had been the reason for his separation from his bother. Alvin' s journey is therefore also a kind of hope for salvation. This peaceful man wants simply make peace with his own past, and succeeds. Aiming for a simple, but nonetheless very meaningful goal Alvin doesn't compromise. Not even when his own vehicle dies shortly after leaving his hometown, much to the disapproval of his own friends. He never accept any favors, but instead offers his wisdom to everybody he meets. Like when he meets a confused pregnant teenager and brings her to her senses by telling a story about a simple game he used to play. Family, so his experience, is nothing else than a bundle of twigs.Lynch places heartwarming observations like this in context whenever he uses panoramic shots of endless wheat and corn fields. It is this land which produces men like Alvin Straight who do not need the hectic and sensual overkill of our modern age. Like his daughter Rose their life center around small things like lightning storms or the color of bird houses or riding a lawnmower. That' s why the camera takes it time to focuse on persons and action. That's why the dialogue fades sometimes into the distance. The picture itself, the actions and reactions are what count. Lynch' s movie might be painful to watch for those audiences who are used to fast-cut action flicks or sitcom humor. Still, in its own silent way, it is a precious masterpiece of Independent filmmaking, and a sure sign that the director hides a true human soul behind all of his preference for absurdity.",

The people he met along the way could have been my dad, my grandfathers, or my neighbors. Although it's rated G, it's not intended for children. Pre-teens, as well as most teens, would be bored out of their minds. This is a gentle movie intended for adults who can appreciate the fear and sadness associated with old age, the regrets of past actions that can't be undone, and the kindness of strangers. This is clearly one of the best films of 1999 and should have been nominated for Oscars for both Best Picture and Cinematography. At least Richard Farnsworth was nominated for Best Actor. As good as Kevin Spacey was in \"American Beauty,\" Farnsworth deserved the Oscar more for his subtle, moving performance.",

It had that feeling of...honesty, simplicity and I could tell right away, that this was a great movie, and it was (and is) too.There are a certain drama movies that succeeds in establishing that..... slow and very touching emotion throughout the movie. This one has it. Dont misunderstand me; it is not a sentimental movie as we are used to in Hollywood, but a really sincere and serious one.The performance from Richard Farnsworth is absolutely great! Restrained, as it should be, but he does so much with so little. He doesnt need to put so many words in it, it comes out great anyway. It's really skillful acting.Despite of what some may think about the \"shots of grain being harvested are repeated a little too much\", I think that those images only strengthens the atmosphere in the movie. It gives a the movie a slow pace (which is good and also the point) and it is accompanied by great music, which alltogether creates that sad and touching feeling. And old man, whos health is failing, taking a last trip (that's the feeling i get), to redeem his mistakes in the past.I feel that the movie is about regret and aging. I can't really put to splendor of this movie into words. Even though I like David Lynch's movie, like mulholland Dr and Lost Highway, I think I consider \"The Straight Story\" to be his best work. It's nothing but great.My advice is, that if you haven't seen this movie, to do that ASAP. Hopefully you will also see the greatness of this splendid movie! Enjoy.",

Farnsworth was absolutely brilliant in his portrayal and takes the audience with him in a trip across the heartland. I have equated this movie to the principles that are the guidelines for a person in recovery, including the honesty, hope, faith, and ultimately, absolute humility, that is the touchstone of 12 step recovery. No other film that I have seen so brilliantly displays these concepts. Even if it is a bit slow for our AD-D world, the individual who is willing to focus on the perfect symmetry of the message against the beauty of the cinematography and characters portrayed will be rewarded.

The brilliant weirdness of 'Lost Highway' or the creepy atmosphere of 'Twin Peaks', are experiences that leave solid prints in your mind. And with 'Straight Story', new and even deeper prints are added, but this time in a whole new way. Previously he affected us by exploring the dark sides of the human mind, but this time it is through an utterly warm movie.'The Straight Story' is based upon a lovely and heart-warming story. And it is told through beautiful photography of the American outback, accompanied by the always exquisite music of Angelo Badalamenti, who has stacked away his synthesizers and brought out an acoustic guitar and some violins. Lynch' well recognizable way to conduct the camera is perfect for his more eerie movies, but it works just as well here. And further - superb acting all the way,  especially by Richard Farnsworth. His face is filled with so much experience and wisdom, that when he starts talking, you listen.All this contributes to make 'Straight Story' an astounding movie. It is a homage to compassion - to human goodness. It is a gentle movie - follows the pace of Alvins lawn mower, but it constantly nourishes your mind and never becomes boring. You feel like joining Alvin on his journey, and share some of his experiences and wisdom. I recommend that you do join his trip - in the hands of David Lynch it can't go wrong.",

Sissy Spacek and Dick Farnsworth shine as the elderly hero and his daughter with a speech defect.   It is refreshing to see a movie with no sex or violence.   The slow pace of the film is totally suitable to its subject--the trip of an old man on his tractor to visit his very ill brother.   The flat landscapes and drab colors of midwestern farm country are reproduced with a stark beauty.   Dick Farnsworth plays Alvin Straight, a kind of travelling saint.   He touches the hearts of everyone he meets with his courage, determination, and kindness.   The secondary characters are beautifully drawn also--from the old man who owns the town hardware store to people who let Alvin camp in their yard when his rig breaks down to a small town priest.   An especially touching scene occurs when Alvin has a beer with another World War Two vet.   Nothing much happens in this movie--there isn't much action but the interaction among the Midwesterners.   But it affects the viewer like a painting by a Dutch Master--the somberness and light and shadow of everyday life is captured unforgettably, and every gesture and tone is carefully selected.

However, as I've always felt, he was a good storytellingdirector and I respect his vision in terms of digging into humanbeing itself in a deeper way of his own.  As story goes, we become familiar with this main character, whois very old and disable to drive.  Why, why, and why...  It wasthe only given question and answer on the surface of the mainplot along with the character driven story, which is that hehears about his disconnected brother for years has had a strokeand hits the road to see him alone on his lawn mower with atrailer.  It is a very simple and boring concept.  People wouldthink that way if I tell this concept word by word.  However,the main point wasn't there as you who saw this film already.I loved the cinematography as well, which added the the maincharacter's journey to the subtle point behind the scenes thatactually showed what he was going through.

Moving quietly, knowingly and sensitively forward for close to two hours to an ultimate payoff where little is spoken, but so much of everything is deeply, eloquently, silently said, the entire movie is a miracle of taste, intelligence and feeling.  The quietness of David Lynch's directorial touches are breathtaking in their simplicity, so refreshing in an era of being hit over the head with \"directorial pyrotechnics.\" The performance of Richard Farnsworth is sublime.  With a combination of age, grace and talent, he inhabits the role with breathtaking perfection.  Sissy Spacek, as his daughter, delivers an uncanny, true performance of a person who happens to have a speech impediment. She invests the character with a delicacy and truth both rare and refreshing.This is a movie like no other.  Give all concerned highest honors for not condescending to the audience.  And pile honor on honors, awards on awards for making a classic.",

Problem is, all  practical means of transportation seemed closed to Alvin, so he sets out on the 350-mile journey from Iowa to Wisconsin on his riding lawn mower.  Straight, played by Richard Farnsworth who received an Oscar nomination and deservedly so, is stoic and quiet on his journey.  He has a lifetime of wisdom, but dispenses it sparingly and without judgment to the locals he meets on his way.Director David Lynch who made a name for himself studying oddball characters in everything from ERASERHEAD to BLUE VELVET and TWIN PEAKS captures Straight's story with just the right touch.  In a refreshing departure from his normal style of film making, Lynch finally tells a story without raising the quirkiness level of everyone in the movie to irritating levels.  As I watched Alvin go on his journey, the fact that his is on a lawn mower didn't faze me for very long.  This film encompasses many big issues---aging, family ties, regrets of the past, and deeply buried secrets, but works them in an unobstructed simple manner.Shot beautifully in the cornfields of the Midwest, Lynch uses the grandness of the land to seemingly contrast how all of us have very small lives in the grand scheme of life's major struggles.  Just when it was looking as if Lynch could never reel himself in, he gives us a beautiful film about the quiet dignity of an old man, and for one day anyway Lynch is forgiven for his bombastic prior contributions to American cinema.",

I saw it some time back, but the details of the entire film had gotten jumbled up in my mind, and I knew that what this movie was really about was somewhere in my thoughts but all in a fog.So on the computer screen I flipped a flipper here and there, scored some points and drained a few steel pinballs.  But that hazy picture was clearing the whole time. I was catching glimpses of the details and substance of this film, which I remember as being at times silly, but mostly riveting.  The silly allowed you to be glad to smile in the midst of the necessary slow pace of the story.  After all, just how fast can Alvin the old geezer (Richard Farnsworth) travel, anyway, on a riding lawn mower hundreds of miles across several states?  (Oh, and pulling a trailer, too!)And so now, I do remember that I had forgotten the cool lesson Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) teaches a roadside runaway who, in turn, finds herself ready to correct some decisions she had made in fear and shame (good quality);  that I had forgotten that the famous cigarette man-in-the-saddle rides much of the range in middle America (not so good quality);  that I had forgotten that even though all's supposed to be fair in love and war, that both of those arenas of life are strewn with the hurting wounded who will NEVER believe that time-tattered saying, for Rose (Sissy Spacek) was trampled in love, and Alvin was shaken in war, and life -- both of them nursing niggling memories that will not go away, caused by unfairnesses in earlier years that robbed her of hope and him of innocence, and tenderness for a brother;  that I had forgotten that the seemingly endless and sometimes corny journey on which Alvin embarked was also seemingly endless in real-time movie-watching-in-the-theater minutes;  that I had forgotten about the sweeping panoramic photography in which you get lost, and in which your own real-time troubles get just as lost.Since seeing this film several weeks ago, I really HAD gotten fuzzy on all these things. But even so, now, I realize that by the end of the film, absolutely none of all the above even matters. These are only the garments the film is dressed in...For, you see, the film is really about only one thing: a man's softening heart intent on fixing a rotted bridge suspended over a horrible, deep gap of disgust and blame, which, if not repaired in time, is going to be the source of unfixable regret.And the last 10 minutes of the film:  simple, haunting, and tension filled, with excruciating silences.  Only a man willing to be a real man will understand the language of that kind of silence.See it.",

Yet the characters Wild Strawberries' protagonist encounters are infinitely more interesting even though less screen time is given to them.The technical aspects (acting, cinematography) make The Straight Story worth watching, but ultimately it remains a poor imitation of better 'travel' stories.  I reiterate - see Wild Strawberries for a richer movie experience. It essentially deals with the same themes as The Straight Story in a less patronizing tone.",

The only problem I had was that Lyle was played by Harry Dean Stanton. Now, I love HDS but I had spent the whole film praying for Alvin to make it to see Lyle in time and when Lyle calls out \"Alvin?\" from his shack I was so relieved.

            "content": "I have just finished watching The Straight Story finally after trying to catch it for some months. There are only a few movies that touch something deep inside, a raw emotion that changes the way you think about all that is dear to you. Forgiveness, redemption, compassion, the simple things in life such as family and friends, the place where you grew up, a clear night sky. But the Straight Story is so much more. It is a simple tale of a man who, in his own words \"has seen just about all there is to see\" and yet realises that before he dies, he has one wrong left to undo. So Alvin Straight drives his lawnmower 300 miles to see a brother that he hasn't spoken to in over ten years. He refuses help along the way, telling those on the road that he has to do this in his own way; this is his rite of passage. Amends perhaps for estranging his own brother... Along the way, he meets many people and he tells them a little of his story which helps to show us a little more of Alvin's motives. One of the most poignant is his conversation with a fellow old timer about their deeds during the War. Another favourite scene is when he's talking to a runaway about the strength to be found in family. Visually, I have always liked David Lynch's work and the Straight Story, despite being a massive departure from his usual surrealist approach is trademark Lynch. The cinematography is simply stunning. The wide camera angles and slow movement conveys and enhances the American midwest and seems to compliment  somehow the peaceful yet dilligent frame of mind of the central character. Richard Farnsworth is brilliant as Alvin Straight. Deep rheumy eyes and a heavily wrinkled face show a man who has lived and yet burdened with with his own regrets. The supporting characters that Alvin meets along the way are good and honest people. Such a nice change from all the badness in the world. And his final meeting with Lyle, his brother, is pure magic. Hats off to Harry Dean Stanton who, when he asks Alvin if he drove all the way on a lawnmower just to see him and Alvin says yes, the look in his eyes he gives back closes the film beautifully. Put simply, The Straight Story is an honest and gentle tale of human goodness and only those without a soul could find this film less than enjoyable. Definitely one for the DVD collection and a movie that deserves to become a classic. Highly recommended.",

The Straight story is a  love declaration between Lynch and America. There are no negative characters, from the priest to the redneck, they all get a fair, compassionate, treatment. There's no trace of cynicism in the somewhat off beat characters (no cynicism? in the 90's? can that be?).

But i still know all his other films, though, and i can clearly say this doesn't look at all like a Lynch movie. I mean, when we think about David Lynch, we think about bizarre imagery, shocking violence and hard-to-watch scenes. But this one has no violence, no profanity, is G-rated, and it's even made by Disney.Premiering in 1999, The Straight Story tells us the real story of WW2 veteran Alvin Straight, played by Richard Farnsworth in his final film role, who lives in Iowa with his daughter Rose, a woman with an intellectual disability played by Oscar-winner Sissy Spacek. Alvin has difficulties to walk and he spends most of his time on a lawnmower. When he discovers that his brother Lyle, whom he hasn't speak with for many years, suffered a stroke, he decides to travel from Iowa to Wisconsin to see him again and make amends with him. And since he's too old to drive a car, how does he travel there? With his lawnmower. I know it sounds crazy, but it's true. The journey is long and kinda boring. But at the end, he reaches his destiny and gets to rejoin his brother.Fun facts: 1- This movie was shot in chronological order. 2- Richard Farnsworth was terminally ill with bone cancer (so much that he committed suicide the next year), making him hard for him to stand up. 3- Farnsworth only accepted the role out of respect for Alvin Straight (by the way, both of them were born in the year 1920) and also when Lynch assured him there was no profanity in the film.What can i say about the movie? It's based on a real story and it's pretty realistic. It's dialogue has been compared to the works of Ernest Hemingway. It's acting is pretty good. Richard Farnsworth was magnificient as Alvin Straight. In fact, he should've won the Oscar that year (i'm not saying Kevin Spacey wasn't good in American Beauty). The soundtrack by Angelo Badalamenti is pretty moving. While i do consider that it was a bit exaggerated to nominate it to the Palme D'or, it was still a very good movie.Despite that, the movie still has some flaws. For instance, Rose's way of speaking was a bit annoying. I know she has an intellectual disability, but it's still annoying. Another thing is that the film is a bit boring. And the ending scene is a bit too rushed, since Alvin and Lyle barely exchange any dialogue. But i still understand that, just like Doug Walker (a.k.a. Nostalgia Critic) said, it showed us all the difficulties Alvin had to go through to finally join his brother.Honestly, is a pretty good movie. Is amazingly acted, pretty realistic, and it's contrast with the other Lynch films is pretty amazing. I'd wish Disney could still make live action movies as good as this one. And i consider that Farnsworth was a pretty underrated actor. I truly recommend The Straight Story.",

About an older man, visiting his brother who he heard got a stroke, and wanting to see him one last time. He travels 300 miles by a lawnmower of all things. the film doesn't convey a lot about the main protagonist Alvin, every now and then he slips out little things revealing more about his character. The whole time you just wanna hear more about what Alvin's got to say, giving life advice, his up bringing, his ideals, living in the middle of rural America in Iowa, his interest, his hobbies, how he didn't want to get the bus to Wisconsin to visit his brother, or ask a family friend, or anyone he met on the way, he was so adamant about doing this on his own and it makes you wonder why the whole time.(Spoiler ahead)\nHe does it! meets his brother played by Harry Dean Stanton only for a short scene, they hardly say anything, nothing profound, and the film ends with Alvin looking up at the sky, and the sky turning into the night sky the same way the film starts, I wished there was more words that were exchanged between the 2, before hand they didn't speak for over 10 years over an petty drunk argument, wished they dove into that a bit more, about their past relationship, I don't know... The film's great! non of my friends won't like it, but it's an interesting watch.I love how this is a true story, that took place in the 90's, the film was set in the 90's (obviously), and was MADE in the 90's (1999) I love films that are set and made in the time period it's set a made in, like in 'The Basketball Diaries' (1995) Although the story took place in the 70's, the director wanted the movie to be set in the 90's.The Japanese poster for the film is one of my all time favourites as well as it's aesthetics used, in the poster is Alvin driving the lawnmower at day time, but the sky is black. I hardly see any other medium of art depicting this, not even Photoshop of a beach in the middle of the day with a black starry night sky instead of a bright blue sky, wish there was more art like this, and also love to know who designed the Japanese B5 Chirashi Flyer poster!One of David Lynch's least likely films he's made, produced by Walt Disney Pictures, I'm not sure why he wanted to make the film initially, but I'm glad he did, I'm also glad Richard Farnsworth got the nomination for Lead Actor for this film. Apparently Richard was in a lot of pain due to his cancer during the shooting of this film, which I'm fascinated with and at the same time saddened, it's interesting how something like that could bring a lot more depth to the character, seems a bit method which I'm guessing wasn't Richard's intention (maybe for David's but who can really say for sure, I doubt it was), Richard was of similar age to Alvin, David even once said in an interview that Richard was born the play him which I love.After watching this film it's made me want to watch more Richard Farnsworth films, buy a really good CRT TV, and watch old westerns or films in similar vein to this one, kind of like shows that Quentin was in to that are depicted in 'Once Upon a time in Hollywood' with Leo's character.\nAnd even go to rural America and learn more about the culture of the Midwest, why small towns exist, how they come to be and where are they now, and all of that.\nI love to know any other films or shows similar to The Straight Story, the only other film I can think of is Nebraska (2013) Which coincidentally I'm also obsessed with.",

            "content": "I find The Straight Story to be, contrary to what many have said, a very Lynchian film. But I haven't been witness to a more melancholic Lynch since The Elephant Man. One central thread in Straight Story is, just like in the black-and-white Anthony Hopkins drama, repressed emotions and people who are misunderstood because of their appearance or behavior. It seems Lynch has picked up the thread from then, and placed it within the context of the mythological rural American framework he has spent the last ten years developing. Considering his devotion to strong visual ingredients, at first it would seem inappropriate for Disney to put its hallmark on the result, but it's not. For the most part, Lynch plays it cool; only a few times giving in to the temptation to develop the bizarre aspect of the situation (\"the owls are not what they seem\").The main character, Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth), bears a striking resemblance to those furrowed old men often turning up in the work of Donald Duck cartoonist Carl Barks. The film starts off with Straight receiving word from his brother, who lives a few states further east. Having had no contact the last then years, the two have resorted to denial of each other's existence. Straight is haunted by thoughts about the past and an unfinished feud with his brother, and decides to drive and visit him. Neither in possession of a driver's license nor a car, he chooses his only means of transport: A lawn mower.Multiple technical problems break up the journey, which for us results in a lot of beautiful scenes from rural America each time Alvin stops to receive help from friendly locals (unlikely, at times). Judging only by the landscape scenes the film is quickly placed within the road movie genre, but taking into account the story, it lacks the eruptive quality of most such films, in stead harboring a concentrated quiet, like in Paris, Texas. Straight's trip echoes his past, which was spent partly traveling around.Richard Farnsworth is charmingly clumsy in his portrayal of Straight. Coming across as a self-consciously old man with all the right answers that indicates that he has surrendered to the inevitable biological decay. Essential enough, though, Farnsworth reveals a youthful aspect in some of his expressions that clearly marks him off from the other elderly people he meets. It is as if Lynch wants to tell us that Straight is not fixed, has not surrendered, but is still in motion with an intention to continue shaping his life. That way it feels like a double warning to \"seize the day\": Both in Straight's personal mission, and in the contrast to the other elderly, who shake their heads in disbelief over the weird ideas from a person they regard as \"nuts\". Farnsworth grins and chews with wandering, intense eyes, working his way through elaborate reflections over life in general, sitting around countless camp fires and at bars and other situations that simply invite to getting philosophical. Lynch is remarkably economical with the moral statements such situations easily could be fitted with, making Farnsworth's part in it subtle, and the metaphors about family and aging seem like slips of the tongue.Recommended (7/10).",

This absurd situation must have appealed to Lynch's penchant for the bizarre, but Lynch plays it, well, straight.  Basically a picaresque tale of Alvin's journey and the people he meets along the way and how he affects their lives.  Most moving is a late night campfire chat with a pregnant runaway, a harrowing exchange of WWII horror stories, and the brief but poignant brotherly reunion.  Lynch manages to make the material his own: odd industrial-noise sounds appear, twin brothers feud and even Everett McGill makes an appearance.  Really a lovely film",

            "content": "I've seen much movies \"on the road\", but this is the most dramatic and the most simple, too. It represents something of extraordinary for the spectators (and I talk for audience and moviegoers), but even for the genial Lynch, the director of this movie, who doesn't usually make linear movies: he prefers to play with flashbacks and anticipations, and his filmography is an imposing demonstration of it. I think about Twin Peaks and my brain explodes if I remember the mental confusion which it has provoked in me XD. But this movie is different. Firstly, it's a true story. Alvin Straight, the protagonist whose surname becomes a brilliant pun with the plot so linear, had really traveled in 1994 for 240 miles on a 1966 John Deere Iawn mover like the movie told us. In fact, \"The Straight Story\" is dedicated to his memory, because he's died in 1996. After this, we have an excellent protagonist: Richard Farnsworth, in his last interpretation. He makes life to a Character whit the \"big C\", because he can show us all the longing which an old man who does a similar trip certainly had. Alvin Straight becomes in my opinion an American Dersu Uzala, or a Don Chisciotte who manifests us how nothing is impossible, and we can defeat our own windmill or slope (physical and moral). Any other character in this movie is treated with the greatest care for detail which only Lynch can use for them. In brief, a great movie whit great characters (in particular Farnsworth-Straight), a great director and a great, linear story, for think and for remember our own past (or future: it depends on age! ^^) and for put all old grudges against everybody aside. SEE HIM!",

And beyond the beauty of the movie, the real beauty lies in the characters. It seems there are only good people in this world. Right from the loving father and daughter, the doctor, Alvin's friends and neighbors,the lawn mover seller, the bus driver, the women on the bus, the woman who hit the deer, the cycle riders, the family who recovers his lawn mover, the old man who buys him the beer, the mechanic brothers, the padre...everyone of them. I just wish if the world was like that.I'd like to mention a few incidents too. Alvin's friends though they ask him not to go never laughs at him when he returns with the broke carriage. They rather express their empathy. The woman hitting the deer gives the impression that she is upset for her car or time but it ain't. She says she loves deer. The family who receive Alvin want to drive him to his brother's and the scene where the husband tries to convince his wife about this is exceptional. Even that run away girl proved to be loving. And of course the great message that war is not fought between countries, not even between soldiers but between innocent men who just want to earn for their lively hood.And of course the cinematography was excellent and the scoring was sublime.

Maybe because I expected something different from Lynch, or maybe because in order to appreciate this film, one simply needs to grow up.I rewatched it recently, and now I apparently have grown up enough to appreciate this movie. First of all, now I saw that the movie is actually very Lynchian in spirit, in atmosphere, in cinematography, in sound design. It has all the typical Lynchian cinematography techniques in almost every frame.Basically, it's a road movie, but a very unusual road movie. But it is also a philosophical tale, full of symbolism, and it is this aspect that I was able to perceive only now.What struck me the most is probably the fact that this story is based on real events that actually happened to a man named Alvin Straight who, in 1994, actually undertook such a journey. The movie was filmed in the exact town the man lived in, with the help of local organizations and residents, and the film crew undertook the same trip in order to shoot the movie (Lynch talks about it in one of his interviews).I once heard Lynch saying that he attributes special importance to a story. A story told at the right time can change a person's life. And this movie is to a great degree about that. Each of the characters the protagonist meets on his way hears only one of his stories, but the viewer hears all the stories and sees how they change these characters; and at the same time the protagonist has his own story, unifying all the stories into one. So the entire film is a meta-story told by Lynch to the viewer. I found this moment just brilliant.The name of the movie is thus both a pun and as play of meanings: the straight story turns out to be not as straight as it might seem.",

            "content": "Bundles of sticks have had a good year in film. They made their debut as a scary harbinger of doom-to-come in the highly over-rated low-budget hit of all time, \"The Blair Witch Project\" earlier this summer.They play a just-as-ominous but much more subtle role in \"The Straight Story,\" David Lynch's wonderful G- rated film based on a true-life story of 73 year old Alvin Straight who drove his riding mower across two states to visit his ailing brother.The Bundle of Sticks revives its role from the over-hyped \"Blair Witch Project\" in much the same way it appeared in that film, showing up one morning outside the protagonists' tent. Here though it is a symbol of strength and one that returns a wayward girl to her family instead of taking her further away.\"The Straight Story\" is just that - quite the departure from the American master of the surreal.Shot with all the care and attention to detail we expect from Lynch, it is not without his trademark quirks. One sequence involving Alvin buying supplies for his journey features a Lynch favorite - the un-scripted buzzing fly that wanders into shot. Lynch - unlike most directors - instead of cutting the shot - leaves the fly in and even generously amps up the buzz just cause he can.But while his quirkiness defines his other films the \"Straight Story\" needs none of that heavy handedness. With the help of a few odd ball characters - watch for the double-pricing Olsen twins and the method acting of the Bundle of Sticks - Lynch has created a film that deserves at least four Oscar nominations come February. (Unless of course they develop a new category for Best Performance by an Inanimate Object which The Bundle would easily snap up.)As Alvin, played authentically by stuntman-turned-actor Richard Farnsworth, sets out on his near 6-week journey his story and the story of those he encounters unfolds with all the ease and pace of a road movie slowed to 5 miles per hour. The \"bread basket of America\" lends itself easily to picturesque setting suns, old timers milling about and combine harvesters gathering grain to create our daily bread.Lynch utilizes this natural canvas to moving effect. Alvin has his story to tell and Lynch tells it not in a spoonfed expositional way, but through little parables he delivers to those he encounters along his journey up and down the hills of Iowa. In a credit to Lynch and his team of editors and writers not one word is misplaced, not one sequence too long. (Lynch and John Roach get the writing credits.)There are moments of pure Lynch scattered throughout this heart-string-tugger that wouldn't be out of place in other Lynch visions; The long open highway and its screen dividing yellow line (\"Lost Highway\"). The sprinkler system that can't get itself to shoot higher than 6 inches while in the background a child chases his ball (the \"Twin Peaks\" TV series). And the plucky score by Angelo Badelamenti (everything good Lynch has ever directed.)But the \"Straight Story\" does something that all the other \"men at a crossroads\" films of late eschew; men can change - even old men - not by virtue of violence but by going against everyone's advice and simply taking that inertia and making a move. Even if it is at 5 miles per hour.",

Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth), a 70-yr-old farmer with a speech impaired daughter (Sissy Spacek), has a stroke, and this reminder of his mortality spurs him to find and make peace with his estranged brother. The problem is that to do this, he must travel 320 miles across America. Without a driver's licence. Ever resourceful, Alvin mounts his lawnmower and begins his quest. And that, really, is all you need to know. The beauty of this film lies in the majestically serene view that director David Lynch takes of Middle America; the picturesque vistas without echo the innate human goodness within. The elderly Alvin Straight, wonderfully underplayed by Farnsworth, is impossible not to like, and on his journey we learn, via his episodic meetings with assorted strangers (who never remain strangers for long), more about him and the reasons behind his voyage. If you're after sound and fury, forget it. The closest to conflict you'll find here is a some haggling over a repair bill, and even that is fairly good natured. But the real trick that Lynch pulls off is the warmth and honesty with which the story is told. Never for a moment does it descend into sentimentality, and it says quite clearly that not every problem has a solution. For fans of less-is-more film-making, this is for you. For everyone else, this is still for you. Unreservedly recommended.",

Perhaps I am simply at the right time and place in my life to appreciate the movie's messages (I can imagine some people, especially younger viewers, not having the patience for its leisurely pace and \"plot\"), but I feel privileged to have shared in a little of the journey (both literal and figurative) of Farnsworth and Lynch's Alvin Straight. One of the most resonant aspects of the movie for me was how it depicted the \"American heartland\" and its people and their very sturdy moral code (a major theme of \"Fargo\", also).  And it isn't a religious moral code either, though it does adhere to the basic Protestant tenet of \"doing unto others as you would have them do unto you\".  In this movie there is a definite sense of people wanting to do the right thing for themselves and for others--an all-for-one attitude.  This is, for my money, the type of movie that we of the spiritually-conflicted new millennium need right now, for it brings it all down to a basic level.  We need to take personal responsibility for ourselves and for others.  Alvin Straight knows what he needs to do for himself and his brother and it is a testament to his character that he lets nothing stand in the way of his doing it.  Alvin and all the others like him are the true heros of life. This story could have, in the hands of many other directors, been quite an intolerable affair (Rob Reiner? Steven Spielberg? Sorry to be insulting, but they would have laid it on thick!). Luckily Lynch was the one to do it, bringing both his keen, at times hokey (here appropriately so) sense of humor and his commitment to acknowledging life's \"dark side\" with him.  Yes, Lynch does Disney, but rather than leaving out the dark side, he simply subverts it (imagine a G-rated \"Blue Velvet\").  From the Olsen twins to the deer lady to that surreal star-dotted sky, things are, as usual, a bit off-kilter in Lynchland....and thankfully so! Final thoughts: It was really nice to have Sissy Spacek back in such an interesting (and, unfortunately, supporting) role. I'd like to thank David for that.  And as good as Kevin Spacey and Denzel Washington were in their Oscar-nominated performances last year, I'd have been thrilled to see Richard Farnsworth win the Best Actor award.  Now that this gem is out on video I look forward to seeing it again.  When you are in the mood for a such an experience, I urge you to do the same.",

He spent over 300 dollars to get a new lawn mower, which would have been more than enough for a plane ticket. And he was offered a ride to his brothers house and turned it down. Which makes me wonder if he really cared for his brother or if he was just looking for publicity. It took him about 2 months to go see his brother who just had a stroke. This doesn't make sense to me. You would think he would want to see him as soon as he could. But other than this ridiculous story the movie is good. I said it is worth seeing because it shows you how stupid people are,  and how nice people are, the people he meets. It also shows you the power of silence. Don't expect anything from this and you might not be disappointed.",

            "content": "Richard Farnsworth gives a straight-ahead performance as Alvin Straight, 73 years old, grizzled, proud, stubborn, yet gentled by his long life. To describe Farnsworth's performance is to describe the movie itself: ruggedly golden, deliberately paced, methodical, focused, and deeply touching. Straight learns that his brother Lyle, with whom he hasn't spoken in 10 years, has been hit with a stroke, and after some thought determines to go see Lyle again. Hampered by bad eyes, Alvin cannot drive, and he is too proud and reticent to take a bus or receive a ride. His conclusion: to drive his old riding lawnmower to Lyle, more than 300 miles away in Mount Zion, Wisconsin. His journey takes a steady six weeks, and director David Lynch slowly paints his movie while Farnsworth slowly reveals Alvin's past, his family's history, his mistakes, his life philosophies.This movie never begs you to empathize, to shudder, to smile, or to sob; you cannot help yourself. Lynch has made a marvel: a movie that is undeniably human yet completely inoffensive. Like the simple rows of Iowa wheat, the steady lines of the combines, the pulsing whirr of the blades, \"The Straight Story\" slowly guides us to a bountiful harvest of forgiveness, humility, and love.",

            "content": "I'm a big fan of David Lynch's, and my appreciation for his work seems to grow with each passing year.  I anxiously awaited the release of his newest film, \"The Straight Story\", after the long drought following his extraordinary but poorly received \"Lost Highway\".  My reward for this wait was a genuine film, with superb performances (though I admit to being moved more by Harry Dean Stanton's five minutes on screen than the admittedly wonderful Richard Farnsworth's previous two hours worth), lush photography (though after the fourth beauty pass over a wheat harvester, my beliefs about the Midwest were confirmed--God, what a dull place in which to live!), and another impeccable musical offering from Angelo Badalamenti.However, there is one fatal flaw in \"The Straight Story\" that prevents it from taking its place beside \"Twin Peaks\", \"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me\", \"Lost Highway\", \"Blue Velvet\", \"The Elephant Man\", etc., as one of Lynch's finest moments--there is absolutely no dramatic conflict anywhere to be found in the film!  Any student of drama knows that in order for a drama to be compelling, there must be a dramatic conflict for the main character to go through, an obstacle to be overcome.  It could be argued that the dramatic conflict in the film stems from Alvin Straight's quandary of whether or not to reestablish contact with his estranged brother, but that question and resolution both occur within five minutes of each other. After that point, Alvin Straight never wavers from his decision.  Others might argue that the dramatic conflict lies in the precarious means by which Alvin chooses to reach his brother (the riding lawnmower he rides across two states).  Though this argument carries more water than the previous one, the two scenes wherein the lawnmower breaks down are played very low key (one of the times the lawnmower is replaced within three minutes of screen time--oh, the suspense!), with Alvin simply utilizing standard means (money and waiting) to get the machine repaired, then he's off for another ten minutes of beauty passes of wheat fields and paved roads.To make matters worse, we are never treated to the inner workings of Alvin's mind.  The traumatic history of the brothers is never delved into, nor are the actual personal battles of conscience Alvin must wrestle with on the way to meeting his brother.  Richard Farnsworth does an outstanding job of passing seventeen different emotions across Alvin's face in any given moment, but this does not entreat the viewer to the impetus behind those varied feelings.  This deprives the movie of both outer and inner conflict, rendering the movie well-crafted and performed, but almost completely lifeless and flat.  Having said all of this, I still think it's true that Lynch's worst outings are often more compelling and intricate than many directors' best, so please give THE STRAIGHT STORY two hours of your time. There are many gems to be found here.",

Their generation seemed to somehow grasp the importance of right and wrong, working for a living, family, values, and a strong sense of American brotherhood.  I enjoyed every second of this movie, the slow pace was necessary for the wisdom, goodness and honesty of the character to sink in to my baby boomer mind.  A man with determination, resolve and regrets making his way ever-so-slowly on the path to correction.  His last chance to make things right.  An interesting guy with lots of baggage but never complaining about it, on the contrary, only lets it out when he deems it could be helpful to someone who can't and maybe never will understand the complexities of life.  I saw the movie as a man that has been on the road all his life, knows he is coming close to the end, and needs to review and assess everything over the hum of a lawnmower.

The movie is about an old timer from Iowa, Alvin Straight, who wants to visit his ailing brother in Wisconsin, so he decides to drive the 300 miles in a lawnmower. The apparent greatness of the movie is in the courage it takes an old man to actually undertake something like this, and the people he meets on the way and what he adds to their life. The unapparent foolishness (which most people seem to ignore) is that it takes him six weeks to make the journey! Alvin cant drive, and he doesn't like travelling by bus, so he would rather spend six weeks on a lawnmower at considerable risk to himself, rather than make a day long journey by bus! He also seems to forget the fact that his brother whom he so urgently wants to see to resolve some old dispute could very well die in those six weeks, rendering his 'courage' useless. A lot of people are touched by the conversations he has on the way with people, giving them parable like insights into life - so where was his wisdom when he needed to get himself on a bus and visit his brother - wasn't that more sensible courage? The movie is excruciatingly slow at times, and besides the fact that Alvin's story is not really worth telling, it could very well be told equally well with a lot of editing. I would not recommend this movie to most people - unless they're suffering from deep loneliness, psychological problems, unresolved issues, etc like the characters themselves.",

Sure we don't have mountains but as you can see, rolling prairie has it's only thing about it. Oh and further to richard Farnsworth, I highly recommend his performace in the movie The Grey Fox.

With captivating simplicity, the movie tells the true story of an elderly Alvin Straight, who back in the 1990's, traveled over 250 miles to visit his ailing brother. Alvin's driver's license had been revoked because of his age and he wasn't about to let someone else drive him because of his stubbornness, so he sets out on his journey using his trusty lawn mower.I'd expect a movie featuring an elderly man to be full of Disney-style, heart-wrenching sympathy traps, but instead the story is genuine and straightforward, coupled with a refreshing message of principle and priority. It also has the best acting performances I've seen in a very, very long time and this only adds to the richness of the movie.So make sure you watch and listen to The Straight Story. It's a movie masterpiece about a journey we call life.",

Why did they cut the time and place he switched machines????? A lot was lost to us purists. Is the DVD offered in an uncut version????? Why is so much notoriety given to Sissy Spacek when the only star of this wonderful story is Richard Farnsworth?????? It looks to me like they also cut the final scene. Why???? This is a wonderful rendition of a movie the like of which used to be offered when movies were the primary method of story telling. More movie making companies should use \"The Straight Story\" as a standard, no violence, no sex and acceptable language. Thank you for the privilege of commenting.",

No disfigured Englishmen. No angels under the radiator. No innocence lost. No sexual awakenings. No dectectives. No sci-fi spectaculars. No Julie Christie. No light/dark haired women. No identity swapping. No dream sequences. No \"I have your disease in me now.\" Yes, maam, this is not your ordinary David Lynch movie. This time he just wants to sing a simple song......Or just tell the unusual true story of a 78-year-old man named Alvin Straight (the wonderful final performance of Richard Farnsworth) who drove his tractor through three states to see his dying brother (played by Harry Dean Stanton, the one wierd element in this film, besides the plot). Oh, Toto, I think we ARE in Kansas again...or Iowa, to be extact. The first time I saw this, I was flabergasted at the almost void of idiosynchcrasies. There are a couple of \"party\" references sprinkled throughout, if not just to remind the audience that we are actually seeing a film by THE David Lynch. This is David Lynch's first attempt at true story telling since \"The Elephant Man,\" and maybe his best overall film since. While I still prefer the likes of \"Mulholland Drive,\" I still think this is one of Lynch's best and sypathetic films to date. This also marks the first time the equally wonderful Sissy Spacek (who has worked with Lynch behind the scenes since \"Eraserhead,\" and whose husband does Lynch's production designs) and her performance gives more from a \"supporting\" role than most films give from the leading ones. The Badalamenti music (see, this isn't such a departure for Lynch, afterall) is just gorgeous, even if it doesn't always complement the film at times. The photography is divine and the direction, as usual, couldn't be topped. The only concern is how many Lynch devotees will be bored while friviously waiting for the film to get \"wierd.\" However, if you enjoy G-rated, Disney-released, Midwestern-set films, then you're in for a real treat! This is no space cruise (despite what the credits will have you believe), but it's worth the fare. A true family classic.",

            "content": "Its sunny roads immediately evoke the night rides of Lost Highway. These two different speeds, from two different movies of Lynch, share a common sensitivity that is hard to articulate in words. Perhaps in these hypnotic shots of the roads, the spatial movement, punctuated by a flux of discontinuous white stripes on continuous black asphalt, contains or points out the constancy and vibration of the determined soul. The camera, the psyche that is witnessing the change of time, the course of time. This is pure cinematic abstraction.It is in this way of thinking and experimenting with the duration of time, this movie sits very well with the rest of the Lynch's work: their essence can be summed up as trying to find the right tempo for the painting/scene at hand, giving it everything it deserves; extending it, creating two-three extra beats for the gravity of this second to sink in and stretch out, but also in order to distinguish this little hill-like moment, so that it can emerge, discontinuously, from the flattening series of moments, one after another, one linked with another, so that the 'overall' tempo of the movie does not dictates the tempo of the moment/second. The moment shines forth.In this search for tempos, the Straight Story beautifully demonstrates a spectrum of slow rhythms which are accentuated by the juxtaposition of other regular paces occupying the high road. It is close to the time of slow cultivation, to the earthly time without falling back on medieval cliches. Only by providing a rich texture of slownesses, the movie escapes the risk of reproducing the caricatures of old age and repetitiveness of the routine. Lynch is able to build up a wonderful temporal intensity: A determined character against the times, a figure of heart that cuts through space that insists on his existence and his will.Not just spatial tempo of moving with a small DIY car, but the perspective on moving on, carrying it on in the old age, another tempo which has to do with culmination, rest, remembrance and difficulty.As though with the old age time is filled 'afterness'. There is no more acceleration, but neither deceleration. In this star-like motionlessness, the old age shows the way to his companies. That distant time where memories become only realities.This is not the time as pure possibility, but time already-past, time as accumulated experience, time as wound and bond that grounds. Thus, the main character is truly an old star, moving next to that big Sun throughout the movie which is in fact Life. He moves, slowly but surely, without feeling any inferiority in the presence of Sun/Life, because he is a star and he knows the darkness in which a star shines (his own death) in the distance, he moves in his own place, in his own orbit.This is a journey movie, but as we move forward in space we move backward in time. Almost circularly, we return and move towards to the original decisions, original bonds as they determine our trajectory, as they already contain the end in themselves. We return to the beginning as though to repeat the unfolding sentence for the last time from the beginning to the end it this time, to conclude.",

Despite a relatively interesting opening, the level of genuine tension that motivates the spectator to continue watching the movie is extremely low. The idea of the director is to unveil a story of two brothers as far as the journey of the main character (one of the two brothers) develops but the degree of introspection is low and the gradual unfolding looses its meaning because it is very easy to detect the motives of the journey. Overall, the movie is characterized by redundancy: the spectator understands from the very beginning that the main character's life is sad but every few minutes, a melancholic music fades in, accompanying the narration of a depressing situation of the past. After the third narration, those among the most cynical spectators may start smiling instead of feeling empathy. I would not recommend this movie to those who appreciated Amores Perros, in the Name of the Father, and Diarios de una Motocicleta because they may be disappointed by the lack of rhythm.",

And then...I fell asleep. I awoke several times while the movie went on. But every time I awoke the movie looked the same. Alvin Straight was slowly moving through America.

Though small, we are not living in the past as this movie highly portrays the \"folks\" of Laurens. If you think that we all were in the same mindset and living quarters of Alvin and his family, think again. The Straight house, better known as the stray cat house is by far the worst looking house in the town, in fact, if it wasn't for this movie, it would have been torn down just as any dilapidated house in Laurens is. We have several large manufacturing businesses in our town that do nation wide and international wide business. As for dogs running across main street, you won't find any as portrayed in the opening shot of the movie. We don't drive old beaters for car, yes, we too in small town Laurens own Cadillacs, SUVs, and other nice vehicles just as the rest of the world. We do have running water, cable TV, and the internet. We do not dress in overalls, wear straw hats, and chew on pieces of straw as was also seen in the movie. For treating the film crew as good as we did, I feel that they did not do us any favors in return, in fact, the portrayal of our town was very misleading and erroneous. Not to mention they were very adamant in keeping the stereotype of rural Iowa alive. It was a good hearted story, but keep in mind it wasn't done just for good-hearted-ness, a buck was to be made.

However, a friend of mine said that it was nothing like the usual Lynch blend of weirdness (and sometimes incoherence), and I was also attracted to the story itself so I decided to give it a try.  Wow - am I glad I did!  It is by far one of the finest movies I have ever seen.  Everything about the film is top drawer - the acting is superb (how Farnsworth didn't receive an oscar for best actor is beyond me), the cinematography excellent, and the music is fabulous.  Add all of these to a great story and you have one hell of a movie. The pace is slow without becoming tedious, and the characters are all uniquely interesting. I could watch it again and again......",

But I was SO wrong.I may not be an expert on movies, but I thought the photography was beautiful - you never think of America looking as it did in this film: lush and green, but with autumnal shades of brown. Some parts were actually quite similar to England. The music was excellent, too - perfect for the film. Amazing that such a simple violin tune actually made me and my girlfriend swing our legs in rhythm, simply because it was so emotive, and we were so \"into\" the film.The main character in this film is played excellently by Richard Farnsworth. NEVER have i watched a film and been so involved with ANY character as I was with Alvin - I really cared about whether he would finish his journey successfully. If this film had been made differently, it (and the characters in it) could so easily have come off as tacky, stereotyped and preachy. But, as it was, they were always interesting, and by degrees funny and quirky (note: the deer woman).I would recommend this film whole-heartedly to anybody. It shows that films don't have to be cynical (as many films somehow manage to be, despite seeming heart-warming on the surfaces) and full of special effects - note: \"The Perfect Storm\". A superb break from the norm, that deserves all of the attention it has received, and a whole lot more.",

He fought in the Korean war and had told me stories of what it was like. He was a type of man that if had something in his mind, he'd let you know what it was.

The film is awash with the midwest countryside and people, it seems to enter into the fabric of the places and locations.

The fact that he didn't write the script for this film might have something to do with that. The aptly named Straight Story delivers exactly what you'd expect from its premise. There's no plot twists or big action sequences to make Alvin Straight's journey more cinematically pleasing. It's just a road trip with a lawnmower to go see his brother. And yet, there's something about it that makes it feel like...something deeper. Maybe it's the ending. Though the stunning cinematography, Angelo Badalamenti's score and scenes where Richard Farnsworth engages in conversations with other people such as a pregnant teenage runaway do keep things interesting. It would probably keep children, the primary target audience for Disney movies, bored. Like, even if you're unaware of David Lynch's style, the fact that such a fairly simple, slow-paced film that delivers exactly what its title promises has the Disney branding is rather weird. The Straight Story is a simple yet beautiful little film that can, at the very least, take comfort in the fact that it's the only David Lynch film that iconic film critic Roger Ebert actually liked.",

The Straight Story is not a complex movie, the script is quite simple but it didn't need to be. Despite its simplicity, the script is also very moving and literate and you can tell a lot of heart went into shaping it. The film is also quite meditative in its pace, but again that didn't bother me at all, because as a quite reflective piece of work the meditative pace was deliberate. Besides, even if they were flaws, which I don't think they are if anything they are strengths in regards to The Straight Story, the film has a number of things to love about it. For one thing, the Straight Story is beautifully filmed with the cinematography fluid and the scenery spellbinding. The score adds to the film's poignant tones, in terms of direction The Straight Story is one of Lynch's best directed movies and the story while simple is beautifully told and surprisingly warm too. Also Richard Farnsworth gives a wonderful lead performance, he genuinely moved me and I felt for his character too. In conclusion, a beautiful film and one of Lynch's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

I wasn't too sure about Spacek's character but when more of her background was filled in it was easier to understand certain aspects of her performance that I had previously found no purpose in.\n\nThe Badalamenti score also added even more value to this film than usual and he felt completely in sync with the mood and tone of the film that at times it could seem like the cinematic scenes were written after the accompanying score.\n\nI had always been told this film was nothing like David Lynch's other work and being a Disney film, found that easy to believe. I guess the mistake I made was always taking this as a criticism, when I now know it clearly wasn't. I found a more digestible Lynch just as emotionally and intellectually stimulating, albeit in a slightly different manner.",

            "content": "(a \"nothing straight about this story\" film review by Timothy J. Verret)\n\nIf someone had told me director David Lynch was going to direct a \"sweet\" film rated G and Walt Disney was going to produce it, I would have said they were crazy. This is the same David Lynch who gave us BLUE VELVET and the TV series TWIN PEAKS and other films that one can easily label as disturbing and unrelentingly violent. But if we play the director's tape through, this is also the same David Lynch who gave us THE ELEPHANT MAN (1980) which was a film deeply moving about the life of John Merrick, a man with a disturbing outward appearance but the heart and soul of a kind poet. So, no crazy here that director Lynch would give us THE STRAIGHT STORY about Alvin Straight, a heart and soul of a kind poet, also a film deeply moving and deeply transitory, as most of our personal and spiritual journeys are.\n\nTHE STRAIGHT STORY is a biographical film of the real Alvin Straight who traveled from Iowa to Wisconsin on a lawn mower to see his ailing brother. I was talking with a friend about this film, and he told me it's not legal to drive a lawn mower on the road. I told him, \"I don't know about that. All I know is Alvin Straight did and we are all the better that he did.\" Alvin Straight is played by actor Richard Farnsworth who gives a heartfelt and deeply tender and exquisite performance. Sissy Spacek plays his daughter, Rose, and she is also brilliant. What is David Lynch's claim to unique and original fame is that he takes stories right out of the colors of a Normal Rockwell painting and turns his stories into dark and brooding shades of what lies underneath these idyllic \"family paintings.\" But as dark and brooding as Lynch explores in his stories, he also finds the humanity of that deep yearning for connection and transformation. It's like Lynch in his stories is telling us something I believe wholeheartedly: You have to explore the dark and brooding to find the light and freedom to humanly connect. This puts David Lynch in a class of his own.\n\nTHE STRAIGHT STORY is not at all \"straight,\" for Alvin has complications with his lawn mower along the way to see his brother, but it's more the complications of the people Alvin meet that make his journey \"nothing straight about this story.\" Alvin meets a pregnant runaway who is in the throes of shame and regret from feeling ostracized from her family. Alvin tells her a \"nothing straight about this story\" game that he used to play with his kids. He would give each kid a stick and tell them to break it, which they could easily do. Then, he would give the kids a bunch of sticks bundled together and tell them to break them, which they could not easily do at all. Alvin would tell his kids, \"that's family.\" The runaway must have been transformed by that because when Alvin wakes up in the morning after this discussion with her, she is gone, leaving behind only a bunch of sticks bundled together. And then there's the \"nothing straight about this story\" Alvin has with a fellow war veteran. They share their pain, regret, grief and guilt over killing men in their tour of duty. Both men weep during their shares, and we weep right along with them because their pain, regret, grief and guilt are ours, whether in the trenches or not. And I will not give away the ending to THE STRAIGHT STORY, but I will give away the \"nothing straight about this story\" journey of Alvin Straight being a deeply fulfilling one and, yes, transitory. It's an ending that is about two brothers who bury the hatchet to be those bunch of sticks bundled together that cannot, no, not EVER be broken.\n\nIn someone's hands other than director David Lynch, THE STRAIGHT STORY might have been ridiculous and even ludicrous, but Lynch is a director who understands what happens when \"nothing straight about this story\" is actually a journey to salvation. Lynch is in no way, shape, or form a \"Christian\" director, but he is a director who understands Christian values, i.e., an inner journey that while on the outside might look ugly is actually beautiful on the inside because of the transformation and salvation of one's spirit. Lynch is a \"anti-Pharisaical\" director; he has ZERO desire to direct on the surface but rather directs for the inner landscape of one's journey to familial connection and the necessary (and desperate) need to communicate. Yes, Jesus Christ would have VERY much liked David Lynch's films, I think.\n\nThere is something about the phrasing of \"another stranger\" that appeals to me and I think is applicable to THE STRAIGHT STORY. I hear this phrasing just about every day when I listen to Lady Gaga's song, \"I'll Never Love Again,\" from the film, A STAR IS BORN (2018). And I'm reminded of the Bible Verse, \"Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it\" (Hebrews 13:2). Alvin Straight in THE STRAIGHT STORY meets \"another stranger\" after another on his lawn mower, and I think our own journeys are about meeting \"another stranger\" after another. It's precisely these \"strangers\" who are our angels on our journeys. They are, in fact, NOT \"strangers\" at all if we show them hospitality. With this, they become necessary, what I would call essentials, to our own transformative journeys.\n\nTHE STRAIGHT STORY is David Lynch's most accessible film, tender and hopeful. It is Richard Farnsworth giving a haunting and satisfying (BOTH) performance as Alvin Straight. And it is a \"nothing straight about this story\" film that informs us all we are on this same kind of journey as Alvin Straight, and we are all poised to heal tremendously from \"another stranger\" journey, whether we take that journey on foot or on a lawn mower.",

It is the kind of movie that you\u2019d think I would find boring, because it roams around at the pace of a lawn mower driving down the road. Yet it seems to relish in the simplicity of this man\u2019s life and the determination in his journey. Along the way he impacts many people and reminds them of the simpler things that life can bring. I found Richard Farnsworth to be so charming, and had a number of good laughs at how he handled the difficulties of what he was doing. The end of the film could feel so mundane, but because of what we learn about our main character along the way, I found it deeply emotional. It\u2019s an unexpected movie that sneaks up on you with subtle humor, and emotions. One thing that David Lynch knows how to do better than any other director is finding quirky actors who create a quaint atmosphere. The Straight Story feels like it is actually filmed in a tiny town right in the middle of Iowa. The people we meet along the way also have a unique quality that make them stand out. Ironically, the most recognizable actor in the entire film is the one I found the most underwhelming. It's not that Sissy Spacek is bad in the film, but her stutter always felt forced and over-rehearsed. It never came across as natural. Aside from that, there was very little that I disliked about The Straight Story. It has that understated warmth that could easily make for a film that I sit down to enjoy with some comfort food and a warm blanket just to make me feel good.",

This journey is not just an attempt to see his brother and reunite with him. This is also Straight's last life statement and challenge. He knows the life won't last and he decides to make a road-trip on a lawn-mower since he doesn't have driving license anymore. Lynch's movie is a rare example of his work based on the adapted screenplay. However, the way he pictures this journey is perfect. Alvin Straight possesses of tons of experiences, but he knows there is no way to utilize it anymore. It's a philosophical and beautiful picture of an old man whose life energy is waning, though his eyes are still young. I really love Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive, but I would call The Straight Story my favourite movie Lynch. Twin Peaks doesn't count!",

In 1993, Alvin Straight, then 73 years old but with failing eyes and legs, drove his riding mower 300 miles to visit his estranged brother who just had a stroke (cameo by Harry Dean Stanton). Maybe Lynch saw surrealism in the story or maybe his innate conservatism (championing family values) drew him to the material.  If you look carefully, you can see his style of filmmaking in the way that the camera simply observes everyone in a matter-of-fact style and the dialogue (which he didn't script himself) is the same sort of non-ironic plain-speaking you get from characters in his other projects.  However, this is G-rated heart-warming material released by Disney, not a vision of the dark forces intruding on all things wholesome (although in the very beginning when we hear an ominous thud and the camera zooms up to a shuttered window, I wasn't quite sure).  Only rarely do things turn a bit weird, almost as if Lynch felt it was obligatory. But these moments distract from the main story which is really about Straight (played touchingly by Richard Farnsworth, who died soon after at age 80) and his interactions with other people, including his autistic daughter, Rose (played by Sissy Spacek), and the unbelievably kind Midwesterners he meets along the way.",

Disney is, of course, the leading production brand for family entertainment and Lynch's work couldn't be further from that magical and innocent material. However, that's exactly what we're looking at with The Straight Story which is a complete change of direction from the usually dark and disturbing Lynch and he proves to his naysayers that he's entirely able to construct something of a different nature altogether. \n\nPlot: After hearing that his estranged, older brother has taken seriously ill, 73-year-old Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) decides that he's going to put aside their differences and visit him before it's too late. Unable to drive a car or take public transport, Alvin buys himself a ride-on lawnmower and begins his long journey over hundreds of miles in the most unconventional way. \n\nNot just in terms of the main characters' namesake, The Straight Story is exactly what it sounds like; a straight and simply told tale that's, without doubt, the most accessible film on Lynch's resum\u00e9. Those with a sound knowledge of Lynch will notice that the characters have no nefarious purposes, there's no metamorphosis, dream logic or hidden metaphors. This is an emotional and heartfelt odyssey about self-reflection, regrets and family connections and there's nothing to suggest that Lynch isn't absolutely at ease with lighter material. His film is a beautiful and poignant road trip that's full of pathos and stunningly captured landscapes.\n\nDespite the simplicity, Lynch still can't contain his propensity for oddball characters and slightly off-key tones but it entirely works for this material. What's most strange about this story, though, is not as a result of Lynch's involvement but because it's actually based on a remarkable true story. The one thing that will draw reminders to Lynch's usual work is his love for small town America and the odd inhabitants therein. Although he keeps himself on a leash, he is still able to capture the idiosyncrasies and mannerisms of ordinary people which still adds a (albeit lesser) surrealistic flavour to the film.\n\nLynch is aided considerably with regular collaborators as well; Freddie Jones' sublime cinematography captures some stunning images and Angelo Badalamenti's beautiful score compliments the proceedings. \nAt the heart of the film, however, is a commanding and heartfelt central performance from Richard Farnsworth. Rightly Oscar nominated for his superb work, Farnsworth is the beating heart of this story - a man that has come to terms with himself and the mistakes he's made in life but still has enough left in his twilight years to right some wrongs. Sadly, Farnsworth's outstanding performance is tinged with poignancy and sadness itself as the actor died with a self inflicted gunshot wound to the head, shortly after the film's release. Apparently, he himself, was nearing the end of his life with bone cancer and took the decision to go out on his own terms - much like the character of Alvin Straight.\n\nA wonderful and measured piece of storytelling from David Lynch. For those that can't handle his darker and more twisted films, then this is one for you. There's no denying it's charm and it's introspective reflection of life and all the challenges that come with it. This really is a pleasant, yet bittersweet journey.  \n\nMark Walker",

It's a straight story. Simplicity is Lynch's greatest ally in this film, and that's a good thing on so many levels. It was time for Lynch to break away from the surreal and all of the complications that go a long with surrealism. Sometimes trying to uncover who Killed Laura Palmer, figuring out who the missing ear belongs to, and making sense of Eraserhead gets too overwhelming. We need a film that is as easy to watch as it is to drink a nice cup of damn good coffee. Damn good film you've crafted, Mr. Lynch.",

            "content": "David Lynch's most deviating film of his regular type of movie making is called ''The Straight Story'' and wow what a moving, gorgeous, extraordinary, emotional, American odyssey this one is. Because the film was directed by David Lynch, who usually deals in the bizarre, we keep waiting for the other shoe to drop--for Alvin's odyssey to intersect with the Twilight Zone. But it never does.\n''The Straight Story'' is astonishing in how simplistic, yet deep it is. Everything about Farnsworth's performance is brilliantly simple, just an old american trying to visit his brother before it's too late, and because he's not allowed to drive, he decides to drive cross country on a lawn-mower with a max speed of 5 miles an hour. This seems like a melodramatic plot to a cheesy movie, but keep in mind, this is based on a true story, and it handles the material perfectly.\nFollowing that notion is how simple but incredibly heartfelt the screenplay is, with simple characters saying things like: ''What is the number for 9-1-1?!'' or ''What do you need that grabber for Alvie?, Alvie answers: Grabbing'. '' but this screenplay also includes some philosophical, deep and meaningful dialogue like when Alvie tells a story to another war veteran about the war, or a little game he used to play with his children (i dont want to spoil anything, but you'll know what i mean when you'll watch it) and there are many more scenes like that.\n''The Straight Story'' is a straight-forward movie that's simple and easy to follow, unlike previous Lynch movies, but Lynch does make this story his own by using imagery and metaphors while shooting this movie. For example the people Alvin talks to, the first he talks to is a young runaway and he tells a story about how many kids he's had and how many grandkids, then he talks to a bunch of adolescents, then to an old war veteran in a bar, then to a pastor in a cemetery, all before his journey ends and visits his brother Lyle. Also the landscapes he drives through start of by being green, full of life, and sunny. But slowly digress into darker imagery, a girl hitting a deer before his eyes, him almost crashing down a hill because of the weakness of his lawnmower, and talking to a pastor on a cemetery. (You see/get the idea right) But the plot is so simple, yet so brilliant and dualistic, the clues in this film...as to why Alvin Straight is REALLY going to see on his brother on his tractor, are delivered with a degree of subtle high-art that even most reviewers of this film missed, but to give a hint... Runaway Girl (aka Dorothy from Oz invoking \"no place like home\" to start the journey) = Human Birth \nDeer-strike Lady = Human Ambition (with the leering deer symbolizing that which is lost in its wake) \nTractor Brakes/House On Fire= Lynch's explanation of what REALLY happened...pay VERY close attention to that scene. \nThe Handymen Dialogue= Human Honesty (as a result of the above) \nBartender Scene= Human Accomplishment \nGraveyard Scene= Impending Mortality \nDead Engine Short Of Destination= Deserved Punishment (notice how Alvin accepts this knowing he has earned this fate) and finally, I feel the greatest moment in the Lynch film... \nOld Man On Tractor= God Camera Pans Away= Dignity Of Private Confession Immaculate Repair= Sins Forgiven\n\nThe Straight Story is a G-Rated masterpiece.\n\n(Tip: before viewing, bring a box of tissues because, man, this film will tear you up. Multiple times. e.g The ending with his brother... yes... the bar scene with the two aged characters talking about the war... yes... Rosie's story of losing her kids... yes... Really, anytime Straight talked about his life or extended his thanks for someone's courtesy... yes, it had me crying)\n\nAll in all ''The Straight Story'' is an absolutely beautiful film, and a hidden gem in Lynch's filmography overshadowed by his magnum opus'.\n''The Straight Story'' is anoverlooked and forgotten masterpiece.",

So, with all his health problem still abundant and against the word of both his doctor and daughter, Alvin heads from Iowa to Wisconsin with a tractor (for which the first breakdown so he has to immediately buy a second one) and a huge trailer of personal belongings. As he travels to his destination, he meets a number of friendly strangers who help him along his way, either by aiding his huge mass transport or by telling tales of their past. Beautifully composed movie, with stirring performances by Farnworth and Spacek. In fact, Spacek's performance is so accurately portrayed that it is shameful that she was not nominated for this fine act. There is such a natural feeling that overcomes this film, rendering it completely unforgettable. The final scene is highly emotionally riveting.

Pacing wise, the film, like Alvin, takes its time getting there. I loved the montages of flowing fields and life in the country. These interludes take on a feeling of a trance between Alvin's strange encounters, accompanied of course by Angelo Badalamenti's score. And this has to be Badalamenti's best work as a composer. The music here is nothing short of breathtaking. It is emotional and haunting, beautiful and subtle. There were a few nights after seeing the film that I would fall asleep listening to the soundtrack. It's just so peaceful. Finally, I was absolutely slayed by the ending. So simple and subtle, its perfect. Just in awe of Lynch's big beautiful artistic heart which is on complete display.",

Titles like Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire have toyed with our minds and coerced us into a new skewed way of watching movies. Amongst all of his films, A Straight Story sadly gets forgotten. I personally consider it to be his best film. It tells the true story of Alvin Straight, an old man who learns that his estranged brother has suffered a stroke. With a life of regret Alvin makes his mind up to make amends with his brother. His legs and eyes have failed him and he isn't permitted to drive a car and so he cranks up his ride-on lawn mower and rides 240 miles to his brother's door step. This is a really (REALLY) beautiful film. It's a welcome G rated Disney movie from Lynch that's wholesome, life affirming and heart warming. Richard Farnsworth plays Alvin and this would be his final film before he died. He was nominated for best actor at the Oscars and he should have won it. If you have never seen A Straight Story then you should... if you love Lynch then this will be unlike anything you've seen from him before. As with other film's he's released onto dvd, the cheeky bugger has removed all chapters so that viewers cannot skip scenes. He wants us to respect the story, respect his work... and fully give ourselves over to Alvin's amazing story.",

It is strange because it's, well, normal and linear. The Straight Story is, easily, the sweetest and most heartfelt David Lynch movie ever. The highlight is, without a doubt, Richard Farnsworth's powerful and touching performance. This is accented by the memorable characters he meets along the way and the gorgeous imagery Lynch provides throughout. Based on a true story, The Straight Story follows the story of Alvin Straight, a no-nonsense good ol' boy who is losing his eyesight and the use of his knees, and his journey across Iowa and Wisconsin to see his brother and make amends before it is too late. Without being able to drive a car, and too proud to accept help or take a bus, he opts for rigging up his old John Deere lawnmower with a trailer and riding that to see his estranged brother. Along the way, he meets several people on the road and has an impact on all their lives. The driving force behind the movie is Richard Farnsworth's deservedly Oscar-nominated performance. He is as sweet as he is proud and his performance really struck a personal chord with me. He actually seems like a close relative or the sweet old man down the street. While Farnsworth takes the lead, the supporting characters really move the film along. Sissy Spacek is a real sweetheart as Alvin's mentally handicapped daughter. There are also several other characters he meets along the way, a girl who ran away from home because she is pregnant, the man who helps him fix his lawnmower, and, of course, \"the blink and you might miss him\" Harry Dean Stanton as Alvin's brother. Lynch also put together some gorgeous shots to accompany the storyline. Periodically, he incorporates shots of the night sky which invokes a dream-like quality to the story, which matches perfectly with Lynch's motif. Shots of the scenery loom with an omnipresence over the entire film and really put you in the Midwest during the autumn season. It is weird that Lynch directed a movie so straight-forward, linear, and sweet. Very un-Lynchian. Lynch, himself, said that he \"fell in love with the emotion of the script.\" And emotional it is. It is a very heart-warming and sweet tale from an unlikely source (a collaboration between David Lynch and Walt Disney? Seriously?). It is very lovely film and a beautiful story with great acting, a wonderful supporting cast, and gorgeous imagery.",

It is one of the most unexpected movies ever - a G-rated, inspirational, Disney-produced movie directed by David Lynch. Seems impossible, right? But it totally works.\n\nBased on a true story, the movie follows a handicapped, 73-year-old farmer named Alvin Straight (an Oscar-nominated Richard Farnsworth) who hears that his brother has had a stroke, and decides to drive 240 miles on his tiny lawnmower to visit him. It's inherently emotional material, with an inherent risk of sentimentality, but fortunately the movie avoids that. He meets some people along the way who help him, and we also get to see his relationship with his slightly mentally-challenged daughter (Sissy Spacek).\n\nThe movie is warm, down-to-earth, and straightforward, as the title suggests. Farnsworth is fantastic as the stubborn and proud old man; apparently he was actually physically suffering from cancer and paralysis, disabling him in much the same way his character is disabled. The performance feels incredibly genuine and well-earned. Sissy Spacek, though she mostly just appears in the earlier scenes, is also extremely good as the daughter. You know how Robert Downey, Jr. said in Tropic Thunder, \"You never go full retard\"? Well, Spacek's performance as a mentally challenged woman here is beautifully balanced; she goes just retard enough to suggest the character's difficulties without overplaying it and still making us understand that she is quite capable in her own way. Other supporting performances come in and last for a scene or two, but they're all just what the movie needs.\n\nIt's funny how this movie is both nothing like Lynch's other work, and at the same time totally characteristic of Lynch. Here's how it's not like other Lynch movies: there's no violence, no sex, no hideous creatures, no people turning into other people, no arcane symbols or images, and the narrative is utterly clear. Here's how it is like other Lynch movies: you know that curiously sincere pastoral feeling you get from the early scenes of Blue Velvet, or the opening credits sequence of Twin Peaks? Imagine that sort of note played with complete sincerity for an entire movie. There are a couple of moments of seemingly typical Lynch weirdness - such as the woman who keeps running into deer in her car, or the woman on the lawn chair in the opening sequence - but even they don't feel out of place or unrealistic. The movie is visually beautiful, with lots of shots of cornfields and such, and clear cinematography; I can't think of another movie that captures the sense of being outside on a sunny day better. It is also helped out greatly by a pastoral musical score by Lynch's usual collaborator Angelo Badalamenti, which, for my money, is his best score. This material really brought out much of what is best in David Lynch, and I wish he would try his hand at similar things again in the future.",

In a career-defining role, Richard Farnsworth plays Alvin Straight, a man who rode from Iowa to Wisconsin on a tractor to see his brother once more before both of their lives came to a close. The thing that makes Lynch's technique so perfect fort he story is that he isn't concerned with making big moments. Thanks to Farnsworth's performance, we immediately sympathize with him and, consequently, nothing in the movie is as important to us as he is. For instance, there is a scene in which a fast-traveling car swerves around Straight's slow tractor; a few seconds later, we hear the squeal of tires and the violence of a collision, but Lynch's camera remains on Farnsworth's face. In this moment, his safety is our first concern. We witness this and other things through the lens of Straight's experience vision and life seems a lot softer. Sissy Spacek is also quite good as Straight's daughter, a mature person with her own pains and fears, the one element of Straight's life that he cannot seem to face fully though it is the one closest to him. She represents both his strengths and weaknesses, and we cannot help but wonder from time to time if he is running to his brother or away from his daughter; is he nostalgic for the childhood of his past or afraid of a future without him in it? As an acute study of the preciousness of human life, as well as a stunning portrait of the midwest, this film is almost flawless.",

            "content": "Based on a true story, The Straight Story is about an elderly man's journey to reconcile with his brother. Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) is a widower in his 70's living with in Laurens, Iowa with his daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek), who has a speech deficiency. Despite suffering from a bad hip and emphysema, Alvin does not trust doctors. One day the phone rings and learns that his brother Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton) has suffered a stroke and may not live long. He and his brother haven't spoken to each other in ten years, which Alvin says is mainly due to having pride mixed with alcohol; but Alvin wants to make amends with his brother before it's too late. Lyle, however, lives in Wisconsin, Alvin has little money, bad eye sight, no car, and no driver's license so he decides to hop on his lawn mower attached to a trailer and travel all the way to Wisconsin, hoping he'll make it in time to see his brother. He encounters an array of different characters making new friends with them and giving lots of helping incite on life to them. Despite all the mechanical breakdowns, he refuses to give up his journey.\n\nBeing that this is a G-rated movie that was produced by Disney, one wouldn't expect that it was directed by the great, weird filmmaker David Lynch. However, the odd choice by him to direct this film was absolutely perfect. It shows that surreal weirdness isn't all David Lynch knows how to do. What we get is a very straightforward story about an ailing elderly man trying to see his brother who he hasn't seen in ten years. There's no mystery, no dread, no good vs. evil, just a plain and simple story. One that is incredibly moving. Despite the subject matter, the tone and pacing is pure Lynchian. The film shows just as much sympathy towards the characters as any of Lynch's past characters and that is the key the greatness that is this film. Richard Farnsworth gives an extraordinarily subtle and moving performance as Alvin Straight. His incredibly nuanced performance just gives his character so much depth. Knowing that he was going through leukemia and in his final stages of his own life gives his performance even more power.\n\nThere are three scenes in the film that stand out the most. The first of which is where he and another elderly man in town reminisce on when they were in the war against the Nazis where we find out that Alvin had not only been an alcoholic, but also been a sniper in the war where one night he made the mistake of shooting one of his own men and he was the only one that knew he had did it and not a Nazi sniper. Later on there is also a scene with a priest in a cemetery where he tells him about him and his brother and why they stopped speaking to one another. Finally, there is the final scene where he sees his brother and you can tell that both are happy and relieved to finally see each other. It's really moving, you just can't help but shed some tears.\n\nOn the technical side of things, the cinematography and Angelo Badalamenti's music are wonderful; the transitioning shots of the fields and the long, unending roads with the music playing is beautiful to behold.\n\nI think The Straight Story would make a great companion piece to Wim Wenders' road movie Paris, Texas as both deal with family and take place a great deal on the road, but most of all both of these films are incredibly moving pieces of cinema. The Straight Story is a film I can recommend to everybody. I don't think there are too many people that would not appreciate this story whether you're a fan of David Lynch or not. It is an extraordinary film. 10/10",

He tends to philosophise to everyone he meets if asked.\r\n\r\nWhy RT insists on calling this Action? Adventure I do not know.

Lynch does the right thing by not including any of his trademark stylistic flashes, instead he decides to tell an emotional story with no punches pulled. The supporting actors, especially Spacek, do what's required of them, but it's Farnsworth (who filmed this movie while battling cancer that eventually led to his suicide a year later) who is so remarkable here. It takes a special actor to work through an immense amount of pain and the threat of dying (only John Cazale from \"The Deer Hunter\" comes to mind), but luckily for us, Farnsworth was able to make this film.

            "content": "Watching The Straight Story I can compare to watching the world cup on television. Soccer really isn't too interesting to me, and is quite a bore personally, but I love watching the skill and athleticism of the players and I can appreciate how well they can endure a long game. With The Straight Story, the movie is such an incredibly boring journey, but the lead performances of the movie by Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek are incredible. There is talent both in front and behind the camera, but David Lynch is more known for his incoherent and maddening min trips that this is a strange choice of movie for him. Alvin (Richard Farnsworth) decided to make a long road trip to Wisconsin to visit his brother Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton) who is in bad health. He is helped out by his slowwitted daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek) and Alvin has to make the trip on a lawnmower because he cannot legally drive a car. Now we can enjoy the continuous and monotonous following of a lawnmower going 10 mph for a whole 100 minutes. The Straight Story is appropriately named because it stays on one straight note throughout the whole movie that never waivers or shifts at all. This is the same line that you see in hospital when a patient's heart has stopped on the heart monitor. In other words, this journey is completely lifeless. Suffering from repetitive landscapes, insignificant passer-bys and too much distance from the main character, The Straight Story strolls down a road that I couldn't care less about. \r\n\r\nWe begin in the town of Laurens, Iowa where we meet Rose. She struggles with simple speech and in the past when her home caught on fire, her kids barely managed to escape. Her kids were taken away from her even though it was a freak accident, all she has is her father. So her father Alvin decides that he needs to go visit his brother in bad health, although they haven't talked in 10 years. The bonding of family spans a matter of feet and hundreds of miles. Lyle is still family, he is worth making the trek for. Richard Farnsworth earned his Oscar nomination as Alvin, an elderly man who knows that he is about to reach the end of the line. You can see in his eyes that he is going to go out with his dignity in tact. As he roves across the farmland, you can see he is still stubborn and he is haunted by what he has seen. There is a great scene in a bar where he talks to another elderly man who was in the war as well. These men have seen the worst of the worst, and that emotional poignancy gives Alvin so much depth and interest. I really wish I could have got to know Rose a bit better though. She just helps her father get on the road, and then she is gone. This makes sense because the story is all about ALvin and his personal journey, but Spacek still felt highly underused. \r\n\r\nThe massive flaw in The Straight Story is the journey itself. Alvin drives on the slow lawnmower to the relaxing rural violin music and beautiful landscapes. He stares ahead wondering what is going to happen next. He runs into a girl hitchhiker named Crystal. She is running away because she is pregnant. They have a pleasant chat over a campfire and then she is gone the next day. Alvin hits the road again and the same music comes up with the same landscapes cross-fading over each other. Alvin stares ahead wondering what is going to happen next, wondering if he can make it all the way. Next he runs into a woman who crashed in front of him after she hit a deer. She complains how she is always hitting deer and then drives away to go into town to fix her car. Alvin stares at the deer, feeling sympathy for the poor animal, then returns to his lawnmower. Alvin hits the road again and the same music comes up with the same landscapes cross-fading over each other. Alvin stares ahead wondering what is going to happen next, wondering if he can make it all the way. As Alvin is going down a hill, his brakes fail and he nearly swerves out of control, but manages to stop. His lawnmower is totaled. His journey may end right here. But wait! The people in small county where he came to a stop happen to have the ability to fix the lawnmower! He even manages to get the parts for cheaper from twin mechanics obviously trying to rip them off. After he refuses some shelter from the people who gave him some food and drink, he gets back on the road very early the next morning. The same music comes up with the same landscapes cross-fading over each other. Alvin stares ahead wondering what is going to happen next, wondering if he can make it all the way. What I am trying to do here is try to give you an idea of how this movie is going to progress. It is a rinse and repeat formula that is used way too much. A better example of a dramatic road trip movie is Little Miss Sunshine. However, Little Miss Sunshine benefitted from its quirky characters and twisted plot. Here, Alvin is by himself the whole time, but he isn't of interest when he is by himself. You never really know what he is thinking and he never has that moment of insight or change that we need to get close to Alvin. We are just another onlooker as he drives by at an incredibly slow rate.\r\n\r\nAnother road trip movie is Into The Wild directed by Sean Penn. What Penn does and Lynch doesn't is put to the front of the movie the aspect of self-discovery and human connection. Into The Wild is about the realization of the fear of human kind and The Straight Story is just about moving from the beginning to the end. There are few stops and little interest. Lynch chooses to test the viewer instead of invite them to join in. We are too distant from Alvin to care about what happens on his journey or what stops will come along the way. Watching a man travel about on a lawnmower isn't exactly a moving or engaging experience. Watching Emile Hirsch as he uses various types of transportation to achieve his goal. It even shows what happens when he reaches his goal. In addition, Into The Wild explains the affect that each character he meets has on his persona. He grows and learns along with stunning nature shots and a beautiful soundtrack. The Straight Story uses the same music and scenery to try and cover up the fact that they have no events to fill this long and winding road with. The characters that he meets are just there to help, or because this 100 minute movie had to have some stops or else we would have fallen asleep. Oh wait, I almost did that anyways. The Straight Story simply cannot connect us to Alvin. One could argue that this is because he is an older man and the issues relate only to his age, but I think it is because we never get close enough to know him well enough. \r\n\r\nHis journey lasted 300 miles and the ending will either infuriate or fascinate some people. The ending is very final yet this journey was so long, an abrupt conclusion didn't seem proper. However, the final line is one that is going to make you think for a bit. I was thinking how on earth this journey could have been so bland and empty. I'm not expecting him to get robbed, have a massive accident or break a bone, but there has to be something to fill up the void. Lynch builds these characters well and the ending is at least worth talking about, but he misfires on what is important: the journey itself. A cinematic journey requires an intimacy with the character or characters who are on the journey, or so I though. To Lynch, just showing the journey is enough. The realism is there, because most trips that we have in everyday life aren't too eventful. If I am going to sit down and watch a journey about a character, it shouldn't be like one of our boring everyday life journey. We want to see a discovery of something new and that feeling of accomplishment once it ends, or even if it is going to end or not. Into The Wild, Little Miss Sunshine and even the teenage comedy Road Trip are examples of journeys with excitement and all are rich with emotion. What if I just set out to get to Alaska right now? Who knows what would happen. Into The Wild answers our question with a fantasy based off a true story. The Straight Story shows us traveling we already know. The Straight Story has the acting and the two ends of a journey, but the middle is what is important. Emile Hirsch as Christopher McCandless said, \"The core of mans' spirit comes from new experiences.\" This explains why The Straight Story is spiritless, there are no new experiences for us to be had.",

For a Lynch film, this is surprisingly (almost shockingly) conventional.  There's nothing weird or bizarre happening, it is just the story of a man's incredible journey.  Even though it is presented by Disney, it is way too slow moving for kids.  Some people may be bored by it, but I had no problem getting into it, there are a number of really nice things going on here, Richard Farnsworth performance, for example.

We are just given the (true) story of a man travelling across America to visit his dying brother on his lawnmower. Its one of those plots that doesnt instantly seem like a Lynch story, but once it gets going, oh man is it Lynchy.\n\nSissy Spacek is brilliant as our protagonists daughter who has a stutter so impractical it would only ever work in a Lynch film. Then there is Alvin Straight himself, who is just one of the finest, strangest characters in all of Lynch's back catalogue. The frail, cigar smoking 73 year old is charmingly realised by richard farnsworth, who makes Alvin instantly likeable yet surprisingly relatable. Alvin is a man who likes doing things his own way, but his kindness to others is never put into question.  \n\nAs for Lynch, well, there are too many moments to mention, the numerous lightning storms which Alvin finds himself watching, the burning house, the harvest  mill. All of these classic Lynch motifs work wonderfully in this new setting, and Lynch manages to conjure up some other moments which prove him to be a great landscape observer, showing that he can do more than just small town America.",

            "content": "Although it boasts a G-rating and Walt Disney's shiny magical logo, \"The Straight Story\" is still, at the end of the day, a David Lynch movie. Regardless of how different the story is from his normal subject matter (and it's quite a departure, yes), this is on the same level as the director's most compelling, disturbing, and best work, such as \"Blue Velvet.\" While it certainly sticks out in his canon of films for its lack of narrative trickery, edgy sex and nudity and oddball profanity, this gentle change in pace from America's most unpredictable and unusual director boasts some of the most \"Lynchian\" scenes the director has ever taken on. Just because its simple, refreshingly straightforward story doesn't deter from reality or into surrealism doesn't mean this isn't Lynch. \r\n\r\nOn the contrary, fans of the director will find his presence in every moment of this movie, from the graceful, fluid camera work to the intimate scenes focusing on the quirky and mundane. Lynch has often done films dealing with middle America, and it's hypocritical simplicity and darkness. This is subdued in \"The Straight Story,\" but it's there. In fact, this may be Lynch's defining statement on middle American attitudes, a more laid back companion piece to \"Blue Velvet\" and \"Twin Peaks.\" Slow but hynotic, meandering but graceful, it's full of powerfully quiet moments that haunt and linger with the viewer long after watching it. \r\n\r\nAs usual, the cast, which is limited, is excellent, with Rciarhd Farnsworth giving the performance of his career (his final screen appearance sadly) in a role that most actors have his age will never equal. Sissy Spacek is practically an extended cameo but does such memorable and specific work in her scenes she feels like a lead. \r\n\r\nEither with or without the knowledge that this sweet, wise, incredibly serene movie was made by the guy who did \"Eraserhead,\" \"The Straight Story\" will still be one of the most beautiful and relaxing cinematic experiences of one's movie-watching life. Lynch is a director of true Kubrickian quality; he takes his ideas, his style, his mood and his attitude, and throws it on a story unlike anything else he's ever done, and comes up with a homerun. I can't recommend this movie enough. How can something so simple, so laid back resonate so intensely? Cinema is full of wonderful experiences, like \"The Straight Story.\"",

The Straight Story does have a Lynchian feel  with the way he moves the camera slowly almost as if filming pieces of fine art.  Also, the way the score foretells the upcoming scene is so Lynchian that I kept expecting Willem Dafoe to jump into the frame a blow the top half of his head off at any moment.\r\n\r\nAlas, the story of some old dude riding his tractor for weeks on end is rated G for a reason.  It is a touching story that is not my cup of tea, but one that I did find relaxing and somewhat enjoyable.  Enough that it will garner a lukewarm positive rating from me.

The cinematography is amazing, the score is beautiful and the acting is brilliant (even the little cameos some actors make every now and then.)

The sound it makes is a little bit like the high pitched opening of a small bottle. Open your lips and a smack abruptly sounds. Abrupt but also gentle. A childlike excursion into the realms of your mouth before puberty leads you down different roads.\n\nTHE STRAIGHT STORY is a film about the ending of those roads. They never dead-end but continue on and on. It is you who eventually pulls off to the side. You sit down in the grassy leaves and close your eyes, never to hop back on the road. All the other cars continue to pass and pass but they, one day, will pull off to the side to rejoin you. Alvin Straight's vehicle of choice may be a John Deere riding mower, but that does not keep him from getting into other cars and going for other rides.\n\nDavid Lynch has made one of the most uplifting films about the essential goodness of the human spirit that can possibly be imagined. Alvin Straight knows that all human beings have a story and he is always willing to listen. And he knows that the others will be willing to listen to him. His entire plan to ride across state lines on the riding mower would be crazier if he was not solely depending on the kindness of strangers to get him through the trip. He may be traveling through the gentle communities of Iowa, but that is no reason to think that such kindness would not lurk in the midst of big cities or the suburbs.\n\nRichard Farnsworth creates a character with such force and with such power that, by the end of the film, you realize that if every single person was an Alvin Straight, the world would be a much better place. He has his demons and he has his flaws. But he remains pure and untouched by the vagaries of cynicism and spite. His journey takes on a poignant complexity as we roll on that tractor.\n\nPerhaps something could be said about the fact that this is an atypical venture for Lynch. I don't think so. Underneath the shocking and bizarre surrealism of his other films, there was always a childlike innocence that regards these horrible things with wonder. Think of how Dennis Hopper's character in BLUE VELVET is essentially just an overgrown child. THE STRAIGHT STORY does contain its fair share of weirdness and darkness, but this is a film with its eyes wide open, gazing at the stars.",

Who would have believed David Lynch's best movie would be G-rated, yes, no sexual perversions or graphic violence here, and released by Disney. What an appropriate name for a movie. In one way, it's the story of Alvin Straight, an ornary old cuss who lives in the mid-west and the other way, it's Lynch playing it straight and showing that the odd characters he's used in his previous movies exist in real life. There are people in this movie who make those in Twin Peaks look normal, such as the female motorist who is frustrated that she repeatedly hits deer on a highway but can't stop because it is the only road she travels or the storekeeper who haggles with Alvin over an grabber. The story is based on a true story as Straight, now forced to using two walking canes, is forbidden from driving. Rather cranky as he refuses to ride in a car with anyone else, he hops on his riding tractor from Iowa to Minnesota to visit his estranged and now-ill brother. Sissy Spacek is his daughter, who may or may not be mentally disabled. The movie never really lets us know. There is a nice small role by Everett McGill, who only seems to get to play nice guys in David Lynch's movies, who sells Alvin Straight a new John Deere tractor with just a small down payment, a hand shake and his word that he will pay it off. Kevin Farley and John Farley, brothers of the late Chris Farley, provide a little comic relief as they play some inept mechanics who try to short change Straight on repairs. He's sees through them. This was one of the best movies of the 1990's and the 20th Century.",

Oddly enough though, it does have the look and feel of a Lynch film, even if it not as odd and flat out disturbing as his films typically are. Decidedly American, The Straight Story is a sweet and sentimental tale of a man who travels 240 miles on a lawn mower to visit his brother who is suffering from a stroke. With a great performance from Richard Farnsworth, The Straight Story is moving and incredibly entertaining, especially as the man visits a nice collection of characters whilst traveling. The cinematography is phenomenal, as are the mise en scene and score. The only problems I have with The Straight Story are the occasionally too slow pacing that bores more than entertains and, even worse, Sissy Spacek. I get that her character has a mental disability, but her performance is awful anyways. She is typically bad, but she outdid herself here with a career-worst performance. Wow is she awful. I could never understand what she said, regardless of her speech impediment. Annoying stuff.

I don't think I can add very much to the previous reviews that sum it up so nicely, but I'll do my best. The Straight Story is not a complex movie, the script is quite simple but it didn't need to be. Despite its simplicity, the script is also very moving and literate and you can tell a lot of heart went into shaping it. The film is also quite meditative in its pace, but again that didn't bother me at all, because as a quite reflective piece of work the meditative pace was deliberate. Besides, even if they were flaws, which I don't think they are if anything they are strengths in regards to The Straight Story, the film has a number of things to love about it. For one thing, the Straight Story is beautifully filmed with the cinematography fluid and the scenery spellbinding. The score adds to the film's poignant tones, in terms of direction The Straight Story is one of Lynch's best directed movies and the story while simple is beautifully told and surprisingly warm too. Also Richard Farnsworth gives a wonderful lead performance, he genuinely moved me and I felt for his character too. In conclusion, a beautiful film and one of Lynch's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Because the film was directed by David Lynch, whoDavid Lynch's most deviating film of his regular type of movie making is called ''The Straight Story'' and wow what a moving, gorgeous, extraordinary, emotional, American odyssey this one is. Because the film was directed by David Lynch, who usually deals in the bizarre, we keep waiting for the other shoe to drop--for Alvin's odyssey to intersect with the Twilight Zone. But it never does.\r''The Straight Story'' is astonishing in how simplistic, yet deep it is. Everything about Farnsworth's performance is brilliantly simple, just an old american trying to visit his brother before it's too late, and because he's not allowed to drive, he decides to drive cross country on a lawn-mower with a max speed of 5 miles an hour. This seems like a melodramatic plot to a cheesy movie, but keep in mind, this is based on a true story, and it handles the material perfectly.\rFollowing that notion is how simple but incredibly heartfelt the screenplay is, with simple characters saying things like: ''What is the number for 9-1-1?!'' or ''What do you need that grabber for Alvie?, Alvie answers: Grabbing'. '' but this screenplay also includes some philosophical, deep and meaningful dialogue like when Alvie tells a story to another war veteran about the war, or a little game he used to play with his children (i dont want to spoil anything, but you'll know what i mean when you'll watch it) and there are many more scenes like that.\r''The Straight Story'' is a straight-forward movie that's simple and easy to follow, unlike previous Lynch movies, but Lynch does make this story his own by using imagery and metaphors while shooting this movie. For example the people Alvin talks to, the first he talks to is a young runaway and he tells a story about how many kids he's had and how many grandkids, then he talks to a bunch of adolescents, then to an old war veteran in a bar, then to a pastor in a cemetery, all before his journey ends and visits his brother Lyle. Also the landscapes he drives through start of by being green, full of life, and sunny. But slowly digress into darker imagery, a girl hitting a deer before his eyes, him almost crashing down a hill because of the weakness of his lawnmower, and talking to a pastor on a cemetery. (You see/get the idea right) But the plot is so simple, yet so brilliant and dualistic, the clues in this film...as to why Alvin Straight is REALLY going to see on his brother on his tractor, are delivered with a degree of subtle high-art that even most reviewers of this film missed, but to give a hint... Runaway Girl (aka Dorothy from Oz invoking \"no place like home\" to start the journey) = Human Birth\rDeer-strike Lady = Human Ambition (with the leering deer symbolizing that which is lost in its wake)\rTractor Brakes/House On Fire= Lynch's explanation of what REALLY happened...pay VERY close attention to that scene.\rThe Handymen Dialogue= Human Honesty (as a result of the above)\rBartender Scene= Human Accomplishment\rGraveyard Scene= Impending Mortality\rDead Engine Short Of Destination= Deserved Punishment (notice how Alvin accepts this knowing he has earned this fate) and finally, I feel the greatest moment in the Lynch film...\rOld Man On Tractor= God Camera Pans Away= Dignity Of Private Confession Immaculate Repair= Sins Forgiven\r The Straight Story is a G-Rated masterpiece.\r (Tip: before viewing, bring a box of tissues because, man, this film will tear you up. Multiple times. e.g The ending with his brother... yes... the bar scene with the two aged characters talking about the war... yes... Rosie's story of losing her kids... yes... Really, anytime Straight talked about his life or extended his thanks for someone's courtesy... yes, it had me crying)\r All in all ''The Straight Story'' is an absolutely beautiful film, and a hidden gem in Lynch's filmography overshadowed by his magnum opus'.\r''The Straight Story'' is anoverlooked and forgotten masterpiece.",
