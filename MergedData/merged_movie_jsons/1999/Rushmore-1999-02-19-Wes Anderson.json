            "content": "Having seen many Wes Anderson films before this one, it's harder to appreciate how fresh and original Rushmore was in 1998. That being said, I can still appreciate the great characters, idiosyncratic style, and fabulous soundtrack. Bill Murray owes Anderson a debt of gratitude for reviving his career and Anderson owes Murray for bringing some heavyweight comedic talent to his film and putting him on the map. Rushmore is definitely weird, but ultimately sweet and rewarding.",

This is not an easily classifiable film, but one that I love for its unique spin on some interesting characters. I especially like the fact that Max is not completely lovable, but in the end you root for him anyway. I found all the various reconciliations quite touching, and there's an interesting emphasis on friendships between people with lots of differences. Max's sidekick is younger than him, his crush is on a teacher much older, his friendship with Bill Murray's character who could be his father. Lots of heart here.",

He get put on academic probation, and falls obsessively in love with elementary teacher Miss Cross (Olivia Williams). He befriends an equally odd wealthy Herman Blume (Bill Murray), the owner of a pipe company. She dates Dr. Peter Flynn (Luke Wilson) which raises the ire of Max. Then Herman becomes infatuated with the lovely teacher and Max gets kicked out of private school.These are truly uncompromisingly odd characters. They are a quirky unconventional group. They are not immediately hilarious but funny in how wacky Schwartzman gets. The dialog is sharp with a lot of unusual Wes Anderson takes. Bill Murray extends his range starting an acting relationship with Wes. It's a wonderful move forward for Wes and friends.",

            "content": "Rushmore was the first Wes Anderson film I saw, and I didn't think much of it the first time. I used to think that Royal Tenenbaums was Anderson's first good film. I thought Bottle Rocket wore its rookie status on its sleeve; I thought Rushmore was flawed; and I thought Tenenbaums finally showed that Anderson had honed his craft and he would start making great films. I then re-watched Tenenbaums and found it to be even more satisfying on additional viewings. I realized that Anderson had actually crafted one of those rare pieces of cinema that reveals itself more and more upon repeat viewings. So I of course decided to give Rushmore a second look. Now that I've had a chance to see the DVD, I've had a much different experience viewing the film. Perhaps because I saw it on Pan and Scan VHS previously? Or perhaps because Anderson's vision requires an adjustment period?Some people will never like Anderson's films. They simply will not appeal to those out there who want clich\u00e9d Hollywood fodder. Some people will love Anderson's films from the moment they see them. Others, like myself, will need to see the films more than once to truly appreciate them. Anderson breaks convention in ways no one has done before - One has to understand that his films are deep where most films are shallow, and shallow where most films are deep. This will throw A LOT of people off, as evidenced by many of the comments on the message boards. Anderson's films begin where others end. In Rushmore, we see Max's fall from grace, not his climb up to become head of every club in his school. In Tenenbaums, we see the aftermath of the child prodigies, not their glory years. Again, this will throw a lot of people off, and indeed I heard this criticism of Tenenbaums quite a lot. Anderson constructs the world of his films around a cinema storybook. They are episodic, told in chapters. Some will find Anderson at first glance to be a rather egotistical filmmaker, as I once did. However, upon second glance, you can begin to see the rich text woven deeper in the films that might be hidden beneath quirkiness or drastic breaks from convention. The first time I saw Rushmore, I felt shock, embarrassment and confusion (Mostly at Max and Rosemary's bizarre interaction). I was lost and unfamiliar with this world Anderson has created. The second time I saw the film I felt Passion, Love, Tragedy and ultimate Redemption. I found the heart in Anderson's film.If you felt Rushmore was not all it could have been the first time you saw it, please give it another chance. You'll find which side you fall on.",

            "review_title": "I lack the proper requirements, er, eccentricities",
            "content": "Rushmore is one of those rare movie experiences for me where I absolutely don't know what to make of it. I've seen my share of indie comedies, quirky films with cleverly subtle nuances, and an intricate focus, but this one has me truly baffled. For the first time in a long time, the screen I was facing and I, myself, had no connection. It was showing me a movie I particularly wasn't following, and I was desperately trying to comprehend why the events were happening, how and for what significance.The movie is not by any means confusing, for that matter, it is fairly simple, but I was trying to search for the comedy in its material, the delivery in its dialog, and the wit in its nuances. This is director Wes Anderson's second feature film after the dismissed Bottle Rocket, and both films share my current view of the man himself; he makes films with a certain whimsicality to them, but overall, they're not that funny and simply not that interesting as a whole. It's a tad harsh to say that, but I was not truly lifted into the zone of appreciation watching either picture. I smiled a lot, chuckled solemnly, but afterwards I felt dry and unfulfilled.In Rushmore, we follow Max Fischer (Schwartzman), a precocious Sophomore who earned himself a scholarship to the prestigious Rushmore Academy. Despite the high expectations of the boy, Max is a slacker when it comes to schoolwork, but is more than willing to start up a new club or write an offbeat play. He grabs the attention of Rushmore alumni Herman Blume (Murray), and winds up becoming close with the man. It isn't long before their friendship deteriorates into nothing when Herman starts crushing on first grade school teacher, Rosemary Cross (Williams), also Max's crush.Meanwhile, while all this is in the mix, Max learns from his principal (Brian Cox) that he is will be given one more chance, but if he fails another test, he is gone, expelled from the Academy. I have no doubt that all of this could have been incorporated in a funny comedy or a relatively steady drama. I envision a drama focusing on the aspect of failing and trying your hardest only to not succeed because of an albatross or limitations to be a rather poignant subject a film could explore, yet still keep the whimsicality Anderson loves to work with.Sadly, none of that is explored, and the film feels the whole concept is one big joke. Its protagonist, to begin with, is an unlikable manipulator of epic proportions, can't give the audience a reason to side with him, and his crush on his first grade teacher is odd and unfitting to the story. What I believe Rushmore is truly trying to be is a tough slice of life, yet it is taken in such a peculiar manner that even that becomes questionable.Now there are elements that are nicely incorporated into the film. The warmth of Bottle Rocket has been traded for a rather crisp look in Rushmore, where the film occupies a very deep widescreen (also called letterbox). It's unusual, yet while the movie is shown in a smaller frame than normal, it appears with more clarity and distinction. It's also safe to say that Jason Schwartzman clearly tried all he possibly good so that the Max character rubs the audience the right way. He is a quirky character, although an acquired taste. Some will see him as a nuance, I see him as an annoyance. But that's not to say Schwartzman's performance isn't very likable. The same goes for Bill Murray, who plays the role of a disillusioned man in search of a home quite nicely.Yet Rushmore still feels a tad underdeveloped and rather vacuous. I guess I lack the proper eccentricities to enjoy such a picture.Starring: Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Olivia Williams, and Brian Cox. Directed by: Wes Anderson.",

            "review_title": "Most underrated movie of the late 90's",
            "content": "This is a love it or hate it kind of movie. I've watched this movie with people with a like-minded sense of humor and they always have a polarized reaction to it. Love it or hate it. Personally, it's in my top 10 movies. Max Fischer is the quintessential oddball kid. A phenom of extracurricular activities but still gets bad grades. He lacks social skills yet is bold enough to say what's on his mind. The genius of this film is how Anderson writes dialogue for his characters as adults but has kids saying the lines. Dirk steals the scenes as he confronts Bill Murray and spits on his car, plays a gun touting nun in Max's version of \"Serpico\" and is the cigarette smoking point man in the final play. Anderson has a great talent for having his characters be odd, yet still plausible. He can really balance that mix, yet still tell a story from his skewed reality. I hope I'm making sense because I just had six shots of whiskey and two Benydril and am nodding off. LOL. Anyway, this movie is about the pain of growing up, the pain of loneliness, the happiness of friendship, the ugliness that we are all capable of and ultimately for Max, redemption.The scene where Max grabs a hold of the yellow kite and starts to get it all back together is great. Back dropped by Cat Steven's \"The Wind\", it's a wonderful meeting of film and music. Anderson has a knack for that. Great soundtrack all around. The closing scene is equally terrific. If you hate this movie, trust me, I understand...I hated it too. It wasn't until I saw it a second time that I saw it in a different light. It's a pretty special movie about growing up and forgiveness. If you happen to rent this, try to get the Criterion Edition; a lot of great extras in there. One last thought, Bill Murray gives a great, great performance as well as Olivia Williams, who, IMO, should had gotten an Oscar nod as well. OK, sleepy time...zzzz",

            "review_title": "Succeeds because there is as much dark emotion as there is dark comedy",
            "content": "Max Fischer has a scholarship to exclusive prep school Rushmore, despite the fact that he really isn't as smart as his demeanour would suggest. He relentlessly talks himself up, forms and joins clubs and seems to impress as many people as he annoys \u0096 all with a very thin veil of lies to support it. When he falls in love with a teacher (Rosemary Cross) things appear wonderful but it is not long before he has messed it up. His frustrated friend (Herman Blume) tries to help but only succeeds in making things much, much worse and Max risks losing everything that is important to him.Having recently see The Life Aquatic etc I decided to step back to a film that I feel did Wes Anderson's humour and talent much more of a service and one in which he got the mix just right. To me Rushmore is that film, although this is not to imply that it will appeal to those that just don't like any of his films. The plot is the usual mix of offbeat characters, strange events and deep seated emotions (and usually not happy ones either), it is quirky and humorous but it still works because, unlike Life Aquatic, it has enough heart and plot to balance out the dark quirky humour. To me the story is still a bit strange and difficult to get into but it does the hard work for you and even when I was still getting into it I was interested if not totally involved. The heart of the story is not one I could relate to, but I was able to feel for the characters and got into it quickly as a result \u0096 none of them are instantly likable characters or simple ones but they are still well written and delivered. The humour is never really consistently hilarious but to complain about a lack of belly laughs is to miss the point; for me the dark humour was well done and I found the film funny even when it didn't draw laughs from me.The cast are impressive and work well with the material they are given. Murray has much more meat in this supporting role than he did with Zissou and he does very good work with it throughout while also managing to carry off his deadpan delivery as well as usual. Schwartzman is spot on with a character that we are never able to truly like but have to get behind at the same time \u0096 he pitches it just right and shows a great understanding of his character. Williams is beautiful and vulnerable and works well in her role while support is good from Cox and Cassel as well as several others in support roles and cameos. Special mention to Tanaka for being the sweetest redemption I've seen in many a film and pulls off the geeky but wonderful girl of many of our dreams.Overall this is a good film but not one that will appeal to the majority of viewers or be the one to win over those that just don't like Wes Anderson's films. The plot and characters are interesting throughout and the film succeeds because it manages to mix emotional content with darkly quirky humour rather than doing one at the expense of the other. An enjoyable film and probably my favourite from Anderson thus far.",

            "review_title": "Gorgeously faithful evocation of an adolescent's mindset.",
            "content": "Overextended rather than overlong, this is still, along with A BUG'S LIFE, the best American film of the year.  Sadly, this has been an atrocious year for movies, so that isn't saying much (being Europeans, we still haven't seen EYES WIDE SHUT or THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, so there's still hope). There has been no outstanding, awe-inspiring, terrifying, beautiful, blow-everything-out-of-the-water film this year, no PULP FICTION, THE USUAL SUSPECTS or HEAVENLY CREATURES.  The main problem with new films is style. Because style has been reduced to empty, showy Lelouchisms, intelligent directors, like Solondz or Labute, have rejected style altogether; and their rather flat, dull compositions can detract from the undoubted brilliance of their content.RUSHMORE has style in spades.  RUSHMORE is (on the surface at least) a very intelligent film.  It is the kind of film my spouse would dismiss as 'a young man's film', but then so, apparently, was A BOUT DE SOUFFLE.  The comparison is not gratuitous.  There is a glorious, gleeful, freewheeling joy in cinema here that carries the film for the first hour, reminiscent of the early Nouvelle Vague, and Richard Lester.  It's odd how these old devices - and there are also echoes of Chaplin, Keaton, the Marx Brothers, Tati and Woody Allen in here too - should seem so fresh and new.  Has cinema stagnated so far?  Most modern US (indie) film is stagy, rigid, overcomposed.  This film uses all the old tricks to show life being lived, not an imposed thesis.As I suggested, the film is probably intelligent.  I say probably, because this is not its main interest.  It does interesting things with Oedipal conflicts - there are at least five father/son relationships in the film (Max/Bert, Max/Dirk, Max/Hermann, Hermann/sons, Max/Edward Appleby), most of which are put under pressure, if not outright hostile, but resolved in unexpected ways.  There is the influence of the dead on the living, unwritten stories intruding on those trying to write their own lives. There is the idea of Rushmore as a conservative, Brideshead-like arcadia, wherein also lies betrayal and death.  The whole Ivy League (or whatever second level's called over there) system is debunked: whereas Rushmore will accept any trash as long as they're white, Max's multi-racial public school seems a much more vital place.What is great about this film is not these things, but its understanding of and sympathy for adolescent experience.  The most obvious marker of this is self-dramatisation, and there is strong evidence (the theatre curtains that open each section; Max's facility as a playwright; the repetition of portraits and framings within the film) that this is not an 'objective' story, but Max's highly mediated view of his own life.  The film is sprightly, energetic, hilarious and inventive when he is on top of life, sluggish and dour when he is depressed.  This actually makes his pain even more moving, and why he can sympathise with Hermann throughout on an emotional level, even when he needs to hate him on a narrative one.Bill Murray gives the year's outstanding performance, which will hopefully be ignored at the Oscars - there is such depth to his angst, such humour to his self-lacerating millionaire, a self-made man who tragically sees himself as a loser.  Few actors today can be so heartbreaking while seeming to do so little.  And people still think Meryl Streep is an actress.It is Jason Schwarzmann, though, who must carry the film, and he is perfect - brave, enterprising, irritating, vital.  His romantic object is rather a drip, as adolescent idealisations generally are, and her swearing wake-up call is suitably shocking.  Brian Cox is hilarious as a gruff, though sympathetic, headmaster, whose fate again suggests youthful wish-fulfillment.  The use of music is as inventive as any great film I've seen.  The film is actually quite bleak, and we can only thank our stars that Max isn't a goth - his doomed inventiveness staves of  despair. Wonderful.",

            "review_title": "Wes Anderson reaches cinematic excellence with Rushmore, a story about Max Fischer a young man who's trying to find his own place in the world",
            "content": "Wes Anderson's Rushmore is a movie full of everything that modern day cinematic crap movies lack; dry humor, unique writing, music that makes a scene unforgettable, and real heart. I feel as though Rushmore is cinematic excellence, Max Fischer is the perfectly flawed yet absolutely brilliant character who tries to find his place in the world, whether it's by engrossing himself in extracurricular activities or pretending he's the son of a neurosurgeon. All of the characters are finely tuned, Herman Blume is a successful man who feels worthless, Miss Cross is a brilliant woman who feels only sorrow because of the loss of her husband. But it is their flaws that make them so wonderful, they aren't boxed into labeled packages, they are raw and real human beings who are just trying to survive. This movie is about, as Max says, finding out what you love and doing it for the rest of your life. The camera angles in this film are interesting, connecting you to the environment and the characters. Wes Anderson picks the perfect music for each scene, especially for the heartbreaking scene at the end when Miss Cross and Max are dancing to the Faces \"Ooh la la.\" But, what's most brilliant about Rushmore is how it makes you feel; pessimistic yet hopeful, sad yet joyful, confused yet clear-minded. A good movie makes you think but a great movie changes your perspective on the world and this is what Anderson has done. To quote Cousteau, as Miss Cross did in the Diving for Sunken Treasure book, \"When one man, for whatever reason, has the opportunity to lead an extraordinary life he has no right to keep it to himself,\" and I'm glad that Wes Anderson created such an extraordinary movie and shared it with us all.",

His characters are so richly drawn, finely acted and beautifully directed, that even when they're not speaking... we can read their emotions, we feel their pain. Young Jason Swartzman gives a fantastic performance.  Even nicer is the surprise turn by Bill Murray, who manages to play a good guy and a villain at the same time. In one scene he  is wearing Budweiser boxer shorts on a diving board. He is smoking a cigarette and jumps, doing a cannonball into his sewer-ridden pool. We see him curled up at the bottom of his pool, drowning himself in misery. Is this a connection to his future lover's dead husband? Who knows. But what we do know is that Anderson has crafted his film to star the most unlikely of heroes. They are the oddest of the bunch, but at the same time we know what they are going through. Their oddness aside, what we learn to see more of, is their hearts. It is obvious Anderson has wiped his heart all over this piece, and it pays off more than I'm sure he ever could have imagined.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson's films are confusing, strange and seemingly pointless. They feature EXTREMELY interesting characters--folks who are very, very unique but strange. As far as the plots in many of these films go, they really seem unimportant--like the film is more a platform for a character study than a traditional film plot. This is not necessarily a criticism--more an observation. And, if you don't mind these sort of meandering films, then by all means see \"Rushmore\".\"Rushmore\" is a character study of an ultra-bizarre high school student who is probably nothing like any living person. Jason Schwartzman plays Max--a seriously strange guy who is impossible to adequately describe or classify--though he is really creepy and becomes a stalker. He is super-involved with a zillion school activities and clubs which he started, yet his grades are abominable. He seems like a nice kid at times, but later seems emotionally disturbed and potentially dangerous. He's also thoughtful and nice and yet incredibly thoughtless and a jerk. Do these combinations make sense? The same could be said, to a lesser degree for the other characters--as they often behave inconsistently and are confusing.So did I like the film? Well, parts of the film were good and I enjoyed them. But the plot just left me very, very cold--as did the extremely deadpan performances (something typical of an Anderson film). My advice is to first see an Anderson film with a more traditional style and plot. While \"Moonrise Kingdom\" certainly isn't conventional, compared to all his other films, it really is! Try it and if you like it, then try \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" and THEN \"Rushmore\". And, if you are really a fan, by all means try \"Bottle Rocket\" and the rest.

It was chronological, assuming you can look past the leaves being gone in October, but bright green at Christmas. Nevertheless, it attempted to give a chronological account. However, the problem was that what happened from scene to scene had little bearing on any prior or future scene. It was just a series of half-hearted skits loosely related.I knew the movie was 93 minutes before I went in, but I would have bet the house that it was a misprint. When I got out and looked at a clock, I couldn't believe it had only been 93 minutes. Does that tell you anything?It is quirky and off beat. The lead character is very unusual and strange.

Granted, he brings to the movie his usual subtle quirkiness, but that humor isn't out of line with the general mood of the film.  The whole thing is seriously funny and somehow seriously real, but at the same time doesn't always take itself seriously.  Seriously.  The idea of the movie doesn't come off sounding like a very captivating plot: high school geek and middle-aged millionaire fall in love with the same first grade teacher.  Not exactly material for a high-grossing box office hit.  But I don't think plot necessarily matters when it comes to making a quality film.  It has a fantastic script, believable character development, and top-notch acting, and that's what counts in making a memorable film.  Why do we love Rushmore? Max and Mr. Blume are the same person, Mr. Blume is just older and wealthier.  They are both creative, romantic characters whose motives are ultimately selfish.  My guess is if you appreciate this film, it's probably because you're the same way.  This movie is about us.  We are the boys who do everything we want to and nothing we're supposed to.  The ones who go to college and get by on as little effort as possible, but somehow still pull through.  At one point or another we all believed we could make our fantasies a reality, and watching this film makes us optimistic about those things again.Also, I don't think a soundtrack makes a film, but it can certainly help set the mood.  Yes, I have to agree with the other commenters for Rushmore: great soundtrack.  But you already know that and it's been said a hundred times, so I think I'll just leave it at that and not beat it into the ground any more than it already has.Right.

Afterall, the movie was about nothing more than his various projects, none of which were fascinating or even the least bit entertaining.People said this movie had a message? I don't think so! Don't use that \"hidden message\" or \"satire\" defense unless you have valid proof of that. A bad movie is a bad movie!!!! Gather? See \"Gregory's Girl\" instead. It was kind of like \"Rushmore\", but unlike \"Rushmore\", it was a good movie.",

RUSHMORE takes a familiar character (a prep student), a familiar location (the prep school) and pretty much makes it something original. I think what I enjoyed most about this picture was that unique feel that comes with all of Anderson's films. It's certainly not something any other director in the world could come up with, I mean, when you're watching a film from Anderson you know it could only come from him. I also thought the Fischer character was a very interesting one as he was the type that could be great at anything he wanted but he always ends up falling short because he's trying to be great at everything. The performances are certainly another major plus as Schwartzman does a wonderful job in the lead and easily manages to carry the film. Williams was incredibly delightful as the teacher who he falls in love with. Murray, who has always done great work in supporting parts, adds another memorable character to his career. The screenplay by Anderson and Owen Wilson perfectly nails the atmosphere of the school, the kids and the various characters that come into play. I did find several flaws in the picture including the final acts, which become a bit too dark for their own good. I'd also say the film runs on a bit too long. With that said, RUSHMORE is still a pretty unique vision and original picture.",

Although you could say this movie has a happy ending, if you have a smile at the end of the film, you're missing something.The characters are all disturbed on some level; Max, although giving the appearance of a mature young boy, really knows very little about life. Herman has the money and the house - but his kids are brats and his life is going nowhere. Rosemary is in love with the perfect man... but he is dead. Yes, this movie is funny, but I mean it when I say throughout the film I was on the verge of either bursting into laughter or tears.The movie is funny because it's true. The movie is sad because it's true. What you expect to happen and what you hope happen never really happen, because really this movie is about life. If you're the type of person who can see the humor and sadness in everyday life, you'll love this movie. It may not be uplifting, but it is reassuring. These characters - with what little they have - learn to be happier people. They learn to move on.Wes Anderson made a story that can encompass all these emotions in a relatively simply plot. Don't be fooled; a lot is going on here. Issues of love, social class, morality, and convention are all brought up. It will make you think about what kind of world you live in, and what kind of a person you are.10/10",

But director Wes Anderson is known for his \"quirkiness\"; and what that actually means, inevitably it seems, is films about implausibly odd people with improbable amounts of money dead-panning their way through a series of deliberately flat jokes whose main purpose appears to be to assert the cleverness of the writer/director in daring to defy the normal conventions of narrative and character. Occasional moments are funny, but refusing to acknowledge your own outrageousness can only take you so far; unfortunately, Anderson has managed to build an entire career on it. Even some who dislike his later movies like 'Rushmore', one of his earliest; but having seen many of his other films first, I can only see the same self-indulgent smugness of his other films. At least we're spared Owen Wilson's goofy act in this one (although he does co-write)",

The performances are all great, particularly Jason Schwartzman in the lead who really sells his role, so I can't fault that side of things. But the characters they are playing just feel that little bit too eccentric.The story didn't really grab me either. In a Wes Anderson film the story often isn't the main attraction anyway its the characters, so when these aren't spot on things can quickly fall apart.Still, the direction from Anderson is great. As it is one of his earlier films a lot of his visual trademarks are in their infancy, so it is cool to see how these evolved in his later films.Overall a good film that Wes Anderson fans will be sure to enjoy, but I must say I do think it is perhaps his worst film.",

But it is Murray who (rightfully) steals the film as a rich philanthropist who befriends Schwartzman only to betray him by also falling for his love-to-be, with a truly funny turn pulling out all the stops including slapstick falls and a great scene of depression in action at a family poolside party  (one for the archives).  Written by Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson (who also directed and both teamed up for their freshman gem, `Bottle Rocket') the film is smartly executed and makes even a sometimes unlikable character an empathetic symbol of adolescent anomie.

This is apparently supposed to be the paragon of mod character humor (go figure!) Even with the admittedly brilliant comic talents of Bill Murray, this does in no way appeal to me as a comic story. I was literally wishing I could wring the little twerp's neck!!! And that's even before he develops this ridiculous crush on a kindergarten teacher, which is taken way too far.To me the actual highlight (lowlight?) of the story was when he's been banished to an \"ordinary\" school, and he gets up in front of class and made a speech saying he despised everyone there. (Geez - what a hero!) And that's not to mention the big climactic moment when the love interest asks him if he'll cope, and he replies 'with wisdom beyond his years'; \"I'll be alright.\" How's that for a profound finish?! Apparently that's supposed to make him sympathetic.Honestly, this is one of the lamest excuses for a comic story I have witnessed in ages. What really amazes me, is that the plot seems like a direct spin on earlier film NORTH.

            "content": "Rushmore is one of the great films about growing up because it's about a kid not nearly as grown up as he appears. By giving their main character so many adult qualities, these filmmakers manage to emphasize how young and immature he really is in a dear yet unsentimental way. Unique, marvelously written and remarkably performed, this film is a joy to watch.Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is the heart of this story. A 15 year old barber's son who's attended class at Rushmore private school for most of his life on an academic scholarship, he's one of the most amazing teenagers you'll ever meet. Like a dark-haired force of nature, he's the leader or a member of nearly every extracurricular activity on campus, including being the writer and director of the school's theater. With the help of his younger right hand man Dirk Calloway (Mason Gamble), Max is like the grand marshal and Rushmore is his parade.About the only person Max doesn't have one up on is Dr. Guggenheim (Brian Cox), headmaster of the school and the one who gave Max his academic scholarship. For all his cool energy and ambition, Max is the worst student at Rushmore and gets put on academic probation. With that hanging over him, Max meets what will become the two most important people of his youth - millionaire factory owner Herman Blume (Bill Murray) and new Rushmore 1st grade teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). He sees Blume as the sort of defiantly self-made man he wants to be and Cross becomes the first woman he falls in love with. But then Blume falls in love with Cross and nothing in Max's exceptional life will ever be the same.Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson came up with a sparkling and inventive script here, one that avoids the problems and pitfalls that plague so many small and quirky stories. While Rushmore only has a little bit more plot than the typical \"here's some stuff that happened to people\" film, it tightly focuses on the character of Max. We only see enough of the others so they can effectively play their parts in Max's story. Almost all of the important moments in their lives happen off screen and we only see the result on them when they re-enter Max's orbit. That focus sustains the connection between the audience and Max and leaves the viewer wanting to see what happens to him next. Most lightly plotted and intentionally clever tales tend to ramble, go off on tangents and fall in on themselves. That doesn't at all happen with Rushmore.The best script in the world, however, is for naught if the actors don't deliver. These performers are more than equal to this amazing writing. Jason Schwartzman does an exceptional job with a character who understands so much about the rest of the world and so little about his own feelings. Max is a 15 year old hyper-achiever, the sort who will go on to do great things in whatever field he chooses. But at this moment in his life, the most important thing is that he's still just 15 years old and doesn't know how to handle his emotions. Bill Murray is also excellent as man who made something of the success that's in Max's future, but has sort of tipped over onto the other side of his life and now has to deal with how much of it is beyond his control. And Olivia Williams is great as the center point between Blume and Max. Max sees her as his passageway to manhood, but he can only truly get there by not getting her. Blume sees her as his path back to the man and the life he once imagined he'd have, but he can only get her by embracing the man that he is. It would be easy for an actress to get washed out in that role, but Williams shines. She perfectly reflects the appeal that Cross finds in the extraordinary boy that is Max and perfectly affirms that separation between boy and woman that has to keep them apart.Rushmore is about how learning you can't get everything you want is the only way to ever have anything of value in your life, because only in moving past what you want can you see what it is you need. It's also damned funny. Go watch it.",

It's just the same old-same old from him, his usual understated shtick - which is great in the right context, but also about all he seems to be able to do, just a refinement of what he's been honing since his SNL days. The only person giving a semblance of performance that resembled an actual human being was Olivia Williams. Everyone else seemed like vague caricatures, like smudged cartoon characters. (Actually the girl who played Margaret Yang, Ms. Tanaka - isn't it weird how Hollywood always casts Japanese as Chinese and vice versa? - she was pretty good too. Hmm. Maybe Wes Anderson should only write women's roles, do some kind of a George Cukor-style project.)I was so uninvolved for most of this film that it was very easy to step out of it and over-analyze it (like noticing how in so many ways it resembles \"Bottle Rocket\" - another grossly over-praised film - thematically and plot arc-wise). I wish I could have been more involved so that I wouldn't have been watching that little counter on the DVD-player so much of the time. But the filmmakers didn't really give me that chance. They seem to have misunderstood the whole concept of Brechtian 'distancing' and they ended up making their characters - as eccentric as some of them are - so muted and schematic that there's no longer any texture left for a viewer to gain an emotional foothold. (At least not this viewer.)I think that twenty years from now people will dismiss this film as \"pretentious '90s indy junk\" the same way that any honest viewer now will look back at films from the '60s - like \"Blow Up\" or \"Easy Rider\" - and say the same.",

Plus, it has been reviewed over 500 times on this site alone.One important aspect of this film, which is overlooked in practically every online review that I've read, is Wes Anderson's nod to the world of J.D. Salinger. The parallels between Holden Caulfield and Max are numerous, and when considered in light of THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS (with its scenes at the museum and the b.b. gun battles), the canon of Wes Anderson is one that has been greatly colored by the imagination of J.D. Salinger. From Max's red hat to his expulsion, the film touches on many ideas from THE CATCHER IN THE RYE. Thematically, the works are quite similar and share an idiosyncratic mood.The other great influence on Wes Anderson, which is even more obvious to any student of film, is the work of Hal Ashby. In particular, the symmetry of Hal Ashby's shots in films like HAROLD AND MAUDE and BEING THERE. Watch RUSHMORE followed by HAROLD AND MAUDE followed by ROYAL TENENBAUMS followed by BEING THERE and you'll completely understand this sentiment.Where will THE LIFE AQUATIC fit into this equation?!?!?",

It is a comedy, but at the same time it is touching and meaningful and works in every way. It's a great example of a film that is done right. It just works. The film is about a kid named Max(Jason Schwartzman), a student who spends most of his time with his extracurricular activities and not enough time with his school work. He is an underachiever, and an enthusiastic one at that. He falls creepily in love with a teacher, Ms. Cross(Olivia Williams) who doesn't quite resent him, but definitely is taken aback by his stalker like presence. Max is friends with Mr. Blume(Bill Murray)who is a man that Max greatly admires, until he falls in love with Ms. Cross. Max decides to get revenge on Blume, and the two have a war consisting of cruel and unusual tricks and mind games. Add to this a young boy named Dirk(Mason Gamble)who wants revenge on Max for telling someone that he had a sexual encounter with his mom. This film is kind of like a French version of THE GRADUATE, mixed with darker humor and a faster pace. Jason Schwartzman does a fantastic job as Max, injecting a kind of arrogance and laid back presence that normally would be ignored in another film. Here, the character doesn't have the usual likable qualities that the same kind of character in another movie would have. Bill Murray also does an excellent job, despite his role not really being a integral as one would think. Right from the scene where his character is introduced, you can tell that this is a different kind of role for Murray. He is able to make the character more realistic by not having an ironic and silly persona and makes the character more human by showing that he has his limits. And Olivia Williams does a really cool job too. Her character doesn't have any sort of haunting qualities that you'd expect from her character and instead is just normal, depressed, and fairly smart woman who just so happens to have a man and a boy after her at the same time. I love the film because it doesn't have Hollywood conventions that people usually look for in a film. Instead, it has a tone and pace that betrays the usual things people are used to. It is a quirky and strange film. The soundtrack is filled with modern classic British tunes. The look of the film is extremely colorful. The film is full of dead pan energy. The intensity of the characters give it an edge that most films wouldn't dare toy around with. And as if it couldn't get any better, the film has one of the most touching endings I've seen to a film in modern years. You'd have to be crazy not to at least appreciate this one.",

The film basically follows the life of a very bright under achiever 'nerd' who you could say in a way is lonely and reaching out for attention thusly his long list of extra activities . The strange thing about this movie is that well it takes one back to their own time in high school and how they look peering in from the out-side wanting to be popular and liked and loved by the babes , also lets not forget about the crush everyone has on that one teacher . I guess in a way this film is about being trying to reach out for love as the 3 main characters in this film display , they are each bound by some form on loneliness. All I can say is check it out , it will make a great change and a chance to walk to down memory lane . Schwartzman, Olivia and Bill Murrary were all great but Schwartzman was the man every one routes for when he goes head to head with Murray over the love of a woman , even though he is too young for her !

Yet, despite this, his mere presence in odd situations seem to elicit laughter from audiences.  Furthermore, I didn't believe that the main character was fifteen, didn't understand his obsession with joining every possible school club, didn't believe any tycoon, such as Bill Murray's character in the film, would identify with such a wierd brat.On the plus side the movie did have solid acting, particularly by Olivia Williams, as Rosemary Cross, and also by a very cute Sara Tanaka as Maragaret Yang.

This movie delves into how we look at the characters and ultimately how we see ourselves and those around us. I could see a little of myself in every character.

I hate directors whose movies are odd for the sake of being odd, and not because it's funny or it makes sense; it's just downright pretentious. He's not even weird or odd in a good way like David Lynch. Some might argue that his humour is too sophisticated or high-brow for my caveman mind, fair enough, I'm just here to speak my mind.

Max is a person who has intellect, ability but lacks the emotional maturity that comes with age. He slowly realises how rude he has been to people around him and decides to make amends.The screenplay by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson has plenty of offbeat moments underlined with a dark melancholy which we experience in Bill Murray's face but it is not always consistent.

Max who is only 15 and Herman who is a wealthy businessman both end up courting Rosemary who is a teacher at Max's school and whose husband had died just a year earlier.On paper this is a pretty absurd plot. However it is carried off very well. Max is not your normal 15-yr-old. And therein lies the charm of this movie.In the beginning of the movie, Max tells friends that his father is a brain surgeon. Near the end, he introduces his father to the same friends as simply a barber. And that in a nutshell is the growth that Max experiences during the film.A cute line, one of Max's friends tells Max's father, \"I thought you were a brain surgeon.\" The father answers, \"People make that mistake often.\"",

            "content": "Rushmore is a rare type of film. It's life affirming, but it's almost complete lack of sentiment ensures that it always gives the impression that it doesn't know it's life affirming, and is also the film's biggest asset. There's nothing worse than a drama that's saturated in sentiment, and I'm pleased to report that Rushmore isn't. The film is a coming of age story and a tale of friendship and romance, but beneath that is the real substance, and Rushmore is ultimately a film about life and, more to the point, contentment. The film follows a fifteen-year-old pupil at Rushmore private school, Max Fisher. Not content with just doing what the school has to offer, Max takes part in any number of extra curricular activities; at the expense of his studies, which has landed him on academic probation within the school that he loves. His world is turned on it's head one day when he meets the beautiful teacher with 'something you cant quite put your finger on', Mrs Cross.Rushmore is one of those films that allows you to forget whatever is bothering you at the time of viewing and just completely lose yourself in it. Wes Anderson injects his usual swinging style, but for a change - it actually works! The film gives off a sense of fun in every frame, and this is one of those films where you can smile at any time and have something to smile about. The film is really funny also, and so it succeeds in being both deep and hilarious; something that not too many films before it had done. The cast excel on every level, but the standout is Jason Schwartzman as the central character. We see him here on his debut, and it has to be said that his portrayal of Max Fisher is absolutely faultless. Olivia Williams really beautiful, and the way she is portrayed on screen aptly portrays what Wes Anderson is obviously trying to achieve with her character. Bill Murray does well also, and delivers what is one of his all time best performances. Wes Anderson's direction is another star of the show, and the way that he weaves the various emotions into every scene is simply sublime, and some of the sequences in the movie have a real substance underneath the surface, and we can feel what the characters in the story are feeling. Rushmore epitomises every reason why I watch movies; and I can do nothing but treat it with the utmost admiration and respect. One of the best movies ever made.",

We really don't know what's going to happen as the story plays out, in part because of how unique the characters are, and in part because the film plays as fantasy. Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), a teenage boy at Rushmore Academy, acts as though he's a worldly middle-aged man, pursuing an improbably large number of extracurricular activities, writing plays, and not caring all that much about his studies. Herman Blume (Bill Murray), a wealthy businessman dissatisfied with his wife's adultery and his two boorish sons, is drawn to Max, and befriends him. However, when the two of them begin vying for the same woman (Olivia Williams), a rivalry develops. What's fascinating about the film is the interplay of these two characters. Blume begins acting in all sorts of juvenile ways, which is an interesting mirror to how precocious Max is. The disillusionment Blume is going through, hammered home with a scene at his dingy, suburban pool where he does a cannonball after downing his whiskey and then stays underwater as it to escape from it all, is similar to the angst we might associate with an adolescent. The breadth of Max's interests, his higher-level thinking about the important things in life, his audacious schemes, and the confidence he exudes pursuing a romance with a teacher or breezing down the hallway in his blazer, is like a powerful movie mogul (or adolescent dream). Anderson gives us a humanizing bridge here between people at the age of 15 and 50.Mixed in to all of this are lots of little moments that are funny or touching. I loved the message that's delivered in a subtle way amidst the fun of the film. Dream big, it seems to tell us; be brave, and don't be afraid to be different. Following the conventional path may lead to outward success, but unhappiness. It's telling to me that Max's father, a humble barber, is the most content character of all. I think the love triangle went on a little longer than it should have, and it would have been nice to see more of Margaret Yang (Sara Tanaka), but it was nice that the film never fell into predictability.

It took out the DVD version (plain old setup of feature plus trailer, nothing else, and you guys at the production company \u0096 adding `Film Recommendations' which is nothing but marketing more films of the same company is not a f*****g bonus. Get a life!) and I was SO disappointed. I won't repeat the plot. If you've got this far in reading comments \u0096 you probably know more than I did when I rented it. The film is good or excellent in these accounts: mise en scene direction, photography, some of the acting, and editing. The rest \u0096 plot, soundtrack (urgh!) and some acting \u0096 was very average to bad. The script was the oddest of them all. And here is where Rushmore can claim to be original. But the problem is that it gets zero on credibility, even within its own quirky world of Rushmore. These kids do not exist in real life, and the worst thing is that the characters' motivation is just non-existent. It doesn't make sense why the teacher keeps permitting Max to come and talk to her. No millionaire lives in a small town like that town Rushmore's takes place in. No millionaire has really that kind of spare time, and no one really acts like he does with his own kids. As a matter of fact, every aspect of the plot and characters is trying to be original while staying within the lines of the general basic notion of the stereotype (jock, nerd, rich guy, minority student) or institution (prep school, public school, head principal, school clubs and activities, etc.). While it looks recognizable, the behavior of everyone in this universe of Rushmore is just not normal. And to expect to run a plot that doesn't really revolve around comedy and not bore \u0096 is very hard, and the film just fails at this. Half way through the film I kept asking myself \u0096 where is this going to?! The film ending's yields very little answer to this question. There are other original American films (I recommend every one of them) that have similarities to Rushmore \u0096 American Beauty, Mumford, Elections. All depict Americana in its quirkiest form, with odd characters and adolescents shown as real people, if indeed at times in extreme representation. But none bore me like Rushmore. As a matter of fact, watching Elections and the Virgin Suicide (yet another disappointment, just not as bad as Rushmore) last week enforced the feeling that this movie could have gone elsewhere.",

            "content": "I have yet to be won over to the supposed off-beat comedic talents of director/writer Wes Anderson and his co-conspirators, the Wilson Brothers. Rushmore is a \"comedy\" centering on ambitious teenager Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), who had one stellar moment of superiority that won him entrance into the elite Rushmore Academy, where he has flourished in extracurricular activities, but steadily failed academically. When a school superior threatens him with expulsion, he stumbles first into a friendship with rich businessman Bill Murray and then into love with comely school teacher Olivia Williams, who ultimately becomes the object of Murray's affections and the cause of friction in their friendship. The plot plays better in summary than when expanded on the big screen. There is a lot of promise in the premise, but somehow both Anderson and the Wilson Brothers manage to avoid mining any big laughs. The film seems to be trying to attain a sense a bemused whimsy, but it never even reaches such a goal much less maintains it. Often Anderson resorts to the now tired gimmick of allowing a hip soundtrack and quirky camera work to carry his straining narrative. Williams is pretty if undemonstrative in a largely reactive role and Murray provides a performance of classy restraint. Perhaps the biggest problem is that Schwartzman's performance as Max is grating. Max is one of the most unlikable and unappealing characters to be the focus of a film in a long time. He is condescending, arrogant, egotistical, childish, obnoxious and finally psychotic. When he starts to go off the deep end over the blooming relationship between his kindred spirit and the object of his obsession, he demonstrates evidence that he is more the serial killer of tomorrow rather than a rising star. We can never understand what quality it is that attracts Murray's older businessman to this pipsqueak, much less why the seemingly sensible Williams tolerates the obvious advances of this undeniably deranged freak. Max is not physically attractive, but even worse, his soul is a dark one, so there is no inner beauty of which to speak. Even worse, the writers seem to think the whole world is populated by people like Max, as not only does he have a young sycophant who worshipfully follows him around to take notes, but a young female admirer who seems to be developing the kind of obsessive crush on him that he has on Williams. Like its central character, the film itself brims with arrogance and contempt and seems to condescend to its audience in a flashy way as if almost yelling \"Look how great I am.\"",

            "content": "\"Rushmore\" is one of two films which I've seen far too many times, the other being \"Vertigo\". They are very different films, of course, but I suppose what keeps me coming back to both is that they are perhaps among the purest, most perfect examples of an auteur's vision. There are certainly many reasons to see all of Wes Anderson's films, after all he is a contemporary master, albeit an acquired taste thanks to all the dry humor and quirk. I've watched \"Rushmore\" with people who didn't even smile once, which seems impossible to me.Everyone knows what the film is about by now, so I won't go into any detail on that. The romantic triangle here with Bill Murray's character Herman Blume, Jason Schwartzman as Max Fischer, and Olivia Williams as Rosemary Cross, a gorgeous young widow who teaches at the titular Rushmore Academy, is gloriously off-beat and improbable, but shockingly evocative of not only the feeling of being in love and the obsession that sometimes follows, but of the adolescent mindset and how it relates to adulthood, and how we probably never really leave it behind. It's really wonderful.One of the most-criticized aspects of \"Rushmore\" is Max Fischer himself. A lot of people complain that he's not 'sympathetic'. Now, I've seen the movie too many times to mention here without embarrassment and I'm pretty sure that we're not supposed to adore Max, accept all his actions (which involve sabotage, putting bees in Herman's hotel room, climbing up to Rosemary's window on a rainy night and pretending to have been hit by a car, and several other self-centered acts) as valid, or feel sorry for him. See \"Charlie Bartlett\" for something pretty similar which makes all the mistakes possible within this format as well as creating a lead character who is inconceivably ego-centric and cocky, without any of the psychological depth there is to Max's character. Max Fischer ultimately feels human, and I'm sick of the need for audiences to have 'likable' characters (read: movie clich\u00e9s, sometimes disguised, but still idealized). I completely buy Max Fischer as a character because I completely buy that the person could exist. Could all of the things that happen in this film happen? Probably not, but it's made so very believable by the stunning writing, which adds depth and layers to even the most minor characters.The humor is highly subjective of course, but it's always worth praising this script by Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson. It's so consistently funny, outrageous, and always with a touch of class and intelligence, always with a humbling human element that produces an almost surprising amount of emotion when you least expect it. The technical aspects of the film, particularly the photography by regular Anderson collaborator Robert Yeoman, are top-notch. Stylistically the film is refreshing and evocative, with more sophistication and class than Anderson's \"Bottle Rocket\". Wes Anderson is an absolutely phenomenal director; his style is completely his own though obviously inspired by Satyajit Ray and Hal Ashby, and he always manages to inject real emotion into his films and occasionally a surprising amount of sweetness without any cloying sentimentality. At 93 minutes in length, \"Rushmore\" is essentially all you will ever need to know about Wes Anderson in a neat little package. It's got the dark humor, it's got the quirk which is still completely believable and real (people who complain about Wes Anderson being 'everything that's wrong with 'indie' film' are probably best left ignored or at least directed towards Diablo Cody, Mark Poirier, whoever wrote \"Little Miss Sunshine\", and all the rest of those hacks to see quirk for quirk's sake, and to an almost unbelievable extent), it's got the pathos, the dark, real emotion, and the phenomenal use of music. All of Anderson's films are worth seeing, all of them even great, but none match the stunning power and resonance of \"Rushmore\", which is still one of the best films ever made, and not 'overrated' in the slightest.",

            "content": "This film is director Wes Anderson's breakout film. And I can see why. Many of his signature elements in his style get developed here. Rich boy (or in this case, not-rich prep school) protagonists, his frequent use of center composed framing, and quirky consistent costumes get added to the kooky characters and generally great selection of popular music for the scenes.While the direction is strong, the story has a few problems going on, story arcs fade in and out and it seems at time as though the movie should be over but it continues going on. At these points, resolutions seem to have taken place, but there's nothing compelling the viewer to continue with the story except for the fact that the movie keeps rolling on although the story arc has completed. In some sense, it's almost as though we're watching three (or maybe four) short films, the latter building off the former. This isn't a terrible problem because it's interesting enough watching, but I couldn't help but think to myself \"It's still going? Isn't it over?\" multiple times through the film.Everything else is good. I like the acting, the score, the production in general and really like the characters despite their flaws. I also like how the story is in part a story of Max Fischer's growing up, forgiveness and to a mild extent, redemption. While I see room for improvement, Rushmore is a fine quirky film that I can recommend to those who like quirky comedies. 8/10.",

            "content": "\"Rushmore\" is a comic original. With its dry, throwaway humor and constant stream of chuckles, it creates its own category of stealth comedy. There's a sweet humanity about the picture, though it's anything but sentimental. It's odd, definitely odd. Credit the film's startling originality to director Wes Anderson, and his co-screenwriter, Owen Wilson. These friends from the University of Texas - made their debut with the independent hit \"Bottle Rocket\". It's structured like a comedy-but there are undertones of darker themes. Whether you see the film as a slowed-down farce, or as a souped-up tragedy, \"Rushmore\" is packed with richly realized characters. Max (Jason Schwartzman), a fifteen-year-old misfit in glasses and braces, a terrible student-but enjoys many extracurricular activities at Rushmore Academy. He is then befriended and then betrayed by Herman (Bill Murray), a school benefactor, when both fall for first-grade teacher Rosemary Cross (the magnetic British actress Olivia Williams)--and Max and Herman make foolish attempts to get back at each other. Rosemary is haunted by her own ghosts. Her husband, a former Rushmore student, drowned the year before. She lives in a room filled with artifacts from his school days. Max reminds her of the boy she married, Herman of the man he never grew up to be. Bill Murray plays Mr. Blume, a local industrialist who somehow, through the veil of his own middle-aged angst, finds himself responding to Max's personality. Like Max, Blume also is alienated. He has a family that makes no sense--a pair of dumb and vicious jock twin sons. \"Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine having sons like this,\" he deadpans. It's safe to say that Murray has one of the most emotionally layered deadpans of the century. To look at him is to recognize in Blume a fellow who, at his age, becomes lovesick and pathetic. He knows it and is sad about it, and yet sees the humor in his own sorry spectacle. This is a first-class performance. While everything is falling apart for everyone, Max brings what closure that can actually be, by delivering the most ambitious school play ever attempted. \"Rushmore\" manages to pay tribute to movies as diverse as \"The Graduate\" and \"Apocalypse Now\"--and still brim over with the pleasures of the unexpected. Anderson fills each frame of his rigorously constructed fable with detail. That extends to a terrific soundtrack of British Invasion hits - Cat Stevens, the Kinks, the Faces, the Who, the Stones - that catches the anger roiling under Rushmore's placid exterior. On subsequent viewings, the plaintive subtext of even the funniest scenes becomes readily apparent.",

Lo and behold it was self-consciously cute rubbish. The only thing that made it slightly more watchable was the absence of Gwyneth Paltrow. Jason Schwartzman is annoying as I'm sure the intention was. Bill Murray does his standing still and pulling a face routine. The script is adolescent. Although the film is about an adolescent from supposedly adult filmmakers one would expect an adult viewpoint. Some have compared \"Juno\" to this and I can see where this view originates from: \"Juno\" at least beneath it's over-cutesy-cool surface had something resembling a heart. If you like comedy without laughs, drama without drama and have failed to develop emotionally I wholeheartedly recommend this film.",

His character is so well rounded and developed he just made the movie. The surprising thing with the movie is the soundtrack. I am beginning to think Wes Anderson knows how to soundtrack a movie better than most out there right now. The use of Cat Stevens blew my mind and it just shows how much Wes Anderson understands movies as a whole. There are so many perfect moments that surprise, but are totally appropriate. The whole scene with Jason getting arrested and the look on his face is priceless. I really with Owen Wilson wrote more and did not try to be some Hollywood star.

            "content": "As I watched this film, I couldn't help but find brief and twisted similarities between Max Fischer's school days and that of Edward Albee of 'Who's Afraid of Virgina Woofe' fame. Before you laugh let me explain:Max recieved a scholarship for a play written in childhood, showed significant reluctance to follow the curriculum, and rather chose to pursue his own interests, especially play writing.Edward  Albee, in most of his biographical information, comments on his difficulities in school, and dropping out of college after about a year and a half, to focus on his writing. Further, Albee's work became recognized at the early age of thirteen when he wrote 'The Zoo Story'.Max was not from the wealthy family as Albee was. Although, the greater than $10,000,000, Herman Blume, (dissatisfied with the conventional, insensitive , sterotypical jock, twins of his own) \"abopts\" Max as a surrogate son.The father of Max was reminiscent of Thorton Wilder who encouraged Albee to follow his instincts and become a play write.\nAs we leave Max he has written his successful work 'Heaven & Hell', his stage production of 'Apocalypse Now'. At this point in time, this is Max's theatrical master piece, his 'Who's Afraid of Virgina Woolfe', if you will.Also, don't forget the name of Miss Cook's deceased Edward Appleby...Now, for those of you who have never been mistaken in reading the undertone of a movie, cast the first stone.

            "content": "The first thing that's striking about this sort of comedy is how particular it is, it's almost like something that was written by a bunch of pals who share the same humor and taste and it got out to the larger public and happened to become a big hit or something of a cult classic. It's very, very difficult to find the same kind of phenomenon in today's industry as movies are made to be risk-free and highly standardized, especially comedies. So this comes across as \"very 90's\" for that alone.It's peculiar in that it's got its own pace, likes to take its time to organize its own eccentric-ish scenes: things like a purposely long scene for a very basic dialogue exchange between two characters, long silent stares and eye contact between the lines, lingering close-up shots of a character all hesitant to retort... and then straight to the next piece of plot.It does really well at somehow holding up, because there is in hindsight fairly little to work with in terms of actual story content, and although it couldn't be called 'uneventful' it seems to enjoy itself at being lowkey in a sense, the film being all about atmosphere and that peculiar feel it produces. It does well to be short enough (just 1hr30) or else it probably would feel a bit slow with that style and pace.The actors are all good and help shape that low key, jaded/ordinary daily life kind of vibe while at the same time being quite grotesque characters, a young Schwartzman and a middle-aged seasoned Bill Murray in particular - which coming together could be seen as something of a symbol for a strong period in comedy, Murray carrying the 80's/90's with him and Schwartzman representing the fresh comedy of the late 90's/early 2000's.",

            "content": "I write this as I play hooky from two term papers that are due in two days.I won a copy of Rushmore on Ebay for very cheap a few weeks ago. I last saw it about 2 years ago. I watched it again when it arrived last week. For all the grief I've given Wes Anderson over the precious, overwrought Tennenbaums (and the equally despised Bottle Rocket) I have to say all is forgiven for making Rushmore. I now think it's the best movie I've seen in the last 20 years. I came late to the movie and have never seen it in a theater. I had the following conversation with a girl at work before seeing it.Her: I saw Rushmore this weekend ----- Me: How was it? ----- Her: It was OK.... ----- Me: It's a comedy? ------ Her: (thinking) No.Let's just say she's not acquainted with dry comedy. That mischaracterization and watching the movie after the Columbine event shifted my initial perception of it. It seemed like it could go some place violent and psychotic, like the similar \"If...\". Only after finishing it could I safely reassess it as a comedy, but now after seven or eight viewings I find it uproarious, which is not to say it's not also poignant.Anderson's style is breathtakingly accomplished for a 2nd feature (!). And the movie reveals more each time I see it. The structure that a viewer can't see, is being orchestrated masterfully by Anderson to pull it all together. It has an extraordinary range of characters none of whom are cheated by the script. The overarching absurdity of the movie is: Though there is concern over Max's bad grades, his classes are supposed to prepare him for life, not further classes. The accomplishments of his impressive extracurricular activities have already insured he's been supplied with a range of experiences and mastered them. He's more ready to be an adult than anyone. The movie forgivingly captures how dumb, driven and confused one is during adolescence, and has a lot of fun with it, but there's also room for a reconciliation with a defeated Bill Murray that's extraordinarily touching. Ultimately the movie you can't figure out on the initial viewing turns out to be a testament to friendship and forgiveness.After so many unworthy projects, Murray finds his perfect director, and is immediately transformed into a national treasure. The performances Anderson gets out of him, Schwartzman and Mason Gamble suggest a very attentive student of human behavior. Murray and Schwartman's performances deserved accolades. But one can't expect the blue-haired MPAA to know what time of day it is. They blew it ...as always.Here are my favorite thoughtful remarks from other reviews: \"With only his second film Anderson proves himself a director so in command of his medium he can ignore convention and make films his own way.\" (Jeffrey Westhoff) \"Rushmore is often touching without being too sappy and funny without being too obvious.\" (J.D. LaFrance) \"There's a thin line between homage and ripoff, and watching \"Rushmore\" walk that tightrope for 90 minutes could be as entertaining as American cinema has gotten in a long time.\" (Desert News) \"Anderson has nothing but affection for his damaged characters, and he treats them with the dignity they deserve. From Bert, Max's unconditionally loving father, to Magnus, a gregarious Scottish thug, it's a genuine pleasure to spend time with these people.\" (Edward Johnson-Ott) \"Now and again there comes a time when, part-way through a film, you realize that you're really enjoying it. Each scene opens to a sense of anticipation at the delights it will afford your world-weary soul, and when the closing credits finally roll you feel renewed\" (Andrew Howe)Lastly, I never use the word 'masterpiece' because it's a pretentious exhausted word used by people to express their own self-regard, but here's the closest I'll ever come: \"Three years ago Anderson and his writing partner Owen Wilson produced Bottle Rocket. But even fans of that film (which has a cult following) won't be prepared for the masterpiece that is Rushmore.\" (Westhoff again)I could blather on, explaining why precisely this is such a great movie but I've said plenty. Thank you for this movie W.A.. It is an exhilarating piece of art.",

It is usually on target and works well, but it isn't as perfect as the majority thinks.The story follows a weird kid (played by Jason Schwartzman of the Coppola family and son of Talia Shire in a fine debut) who is content in being a academically bad student, but then finds the apple of his eye, a teacher (Olivia Williams) who changes his perspective.  But, he is contending against a millionaire (Bill Murray in one of his finest roles) who wants her just as much.  Some very wise moments and looks on school life and love, however, the lulls lower the standards just a tad.  Still, worth seeing for the performances alone, especially Murray.  B+",

But seriously, best is to just go and watch this movie because it really is a matter of taste whether you will like this movie or not. So stop reading all these reviews and just pick up this movie.\"Rushmore\" is a comedy but not a 'haha' kind of comedy (even though the school play Heaven and Hell was simply hilarious), it more is a social commentary. Most people just love this movie for being that but to me it just didn't appeal. I wasn't really a movie that I enjoyed watching. Still I have lots of respect for what the movie is but that doesn't mean I like it.To be honest, I would have never even watched this movie if Bill Murray wasn't in it. He really was brilliant and truly should had gotten an Oscar for his role. I also really liked Brian Cox in his role and also look out for a at the time fairly unknown Connie Nielsen in a small role.So anyway there is no point in saying for me if this movie is recommendable to you or not since it really truly is strongly a matter of taste. You'll either love it or 'don't get it' and hate it. I, for one, didn't liked it but like I said, I still have lots of respect for the movie.

            "content": "Laughably pretentious, one may think that this movie was apparently targeted towards the Brie and chardonnay crowd of moviegoers who need dweebish anti-heroes like Mad Max Fischer and Herman Blume to validate their own pathetic \"Hey, I'm so tragically misunderstood and DIFFERENT than you but I've achieved success!\" worldviews.The kid - Max Fischer (played by Jason Schwartzman) - was utterly unlikable (and I watched the movie several times before coming to this unshakable conclusion, just to make sure I wasn't unfairly being the high-school bully towards the class nerd). He came across as a totally annoying morphed combination of young Woody Allen and Ben Stein. And he didn't even seem teenaged, but more like a young twenty-something posing as a teenager.\nI didn't find anything at all positive or redeeming about Max the entire way through the film. I'm sorry, but fifteen year-old boys just aren't like that, no matter what universe they may hail from. Mr. Blume (Bill Murray) was just preposterous as a supposed \"industrialist\" - yeah right, tell me another one. (The cigarette hanging out the side of his mouth got old very quickly). And their mutual infatuation with that young schoolteacher, Rosemary Cross (played by Olivia Williams) to me bordered on the sick (hey, what was this movie, an allegory for the evils of impetuous men who stalk their female love interests or something?). I'm sorry, but I was just squirm-in-my-chair uncomfortable during my (several) viewings of this film. Yes, I DID give it a fighting chance.If you want to see fantasy-type movies with unbelievable anti-hero youths who raise a ruckus with their surrounding environment, stick with films like Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Ferris (Matthew Broderick) was also a bit nerdish and perhaps annoying, and also quite \"surreal\" in the sense that hey, there just really AREN'T high school seniors like Ferris anywhere, and we all know that... but in the end he was a heckuva' lot more positive, likable and redeeming than Max Fischer could ever dream of being.Come to think of it, if you want rebellious kids clashing with their surrounding world and turning it upside down, rent a copy of Problem Child (1990). Better yet, tune in to re-runs of Married With Children, and laugh (and cry) at the barely believable (but much funnier) travails of Bud Bundy. At least you'll have the joy of also seeing Christina Applegate.",

I've seen Rushmore about 50 times and I'm going to continue watching it til the end of my life. It is one of the ten best films I have ever seen. It entertains and inspires me with every subsequent viewing.Never before have I seen such everyday people brought to the screen in such a believable and moving way. Rushmore is filled with one perceptive scene after another. It is a metaphorical masterpiece.Every now and then a film maker brings to life a unique group of people and lets you inside to see the things that make us human. Wes Anderson  has done it again! It is his juxtaposing of little and big events that lets us see how basically trivial most things we worry about are is truly genius. The characters are so richly drawn, finely acted and beautifully directed, that even when they're not speaking... we can read their emotions, we feel their pain.I love it when I don't know what is going to happen, even within the context of a sort of romantic comedy. Rushmore is a terrific look at why people stay \"together\" in the sense of being a part of someone's life even when danger lurks around every corner.Rushmore is undeniably one of the paramount achievements in modern film. This movie is about freedom -- the freedom to be yourself, to be unselfconscious, to let your mind roam and behave any way you want. Nothing about Rushmore is conventional yet--and this is important--it never tries to shock you in a cheap Hollywood way with violence, sex, or some special effects crap.This film is so un cliche that you really have to praise the makers of this film. As soon as you sit down to watch it, it oozes class. The writing is witty and never, ever falls into kitschy cliche.I think there is a lot of symbolism about art and the creative process in this movie. Not once is there a single frame of film wasted. The gorgeous visuals set a perfect backdrop for some of the greatest movie dialogue of all time.Not.",

The detail that is put into this film alone gives Anderson the aptitude to be one of the greatest filmmakers of his generation. Each character has their own idiosyncrasies that are both bizarre and believable. The main character Max Fischer, played by the then fresh face, Jason Scwartzman is masterfully written in Andersons screenplay. His every movement, the clothing he wears, the music he listens to, everything about him makes this character unforgettable. This film also marks the beginning of the serious Bill Murray, who plays an unhappy, middle-aged millionaire who seems to want and lack the same things Fischer himself strives to attain. Both characters although different in many ways have the same problems, and even though they work against each other throughout the course of the story, end up realizing they are more alike then they anticipated. The dry, and sometimes caustic humor in this film is priceless. Anderson knows exactly how to time a joke, both through its delivery and the cinematography itself. Almost a masterpiece Rushmore is Andersons \"Pulp Fiction\" and greatest piece to date. Rushmore not only spawned a rush of similar films (The Squid and the Whale, Little Miss Sunshine, etc. ) but perfected it at its early stage.",

He went to Rushmore Academy that he considers his life but there he is as the best for the extracurricular activities as the worst student. The film follows Max when he meet two persons that will change his life: Herman Blume (Bill Murray) , a disillusioned millionaire who has an special admire to Max, and Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams), a widowed teacher who Max and Herman loves.\"Rushmore\" is the second film written and directed by Wes Anderson, who right now is one of the bests American filmmakers working and this film is just another great one from his same team. I just love Anderson's style, that works in the same perfect way to all of his films, with all the strange characters, the beautiful colors, the titles of the things and all of those things that when you watch them you will know that is a Wes Anderson film. In this film, i love the character of Max who is a genius for all the extracurricular activities but nothing is appreciate by the Rushmore Academy. I love too how Max has every little thing under control until he feel love for the first time, his behavior suddenly change when he most compete with Herman but actually he is competing for a lady that can't love him because he is only 15 and the lady is a teacher. In the end Max returns to his regular behavior, having again Dirk Calloway (Mason Gamble) as a friend and accepting Margaret Yang (Sara Tanaka), a girl of his same age who meet him in Grover Cleveland High after Max was expelled from Rushmore, as her girlfriend. Because after all, he and Herman did all those crazy things just for a lady that was their Rushmore.The cast is perfect; with Jason Schwarztman in his very first role making a memorable character, Bill Murray in the beginning of his \"new\" career in which he seem that is not acting, he is just always with the same expression making that his character looks boring of life. He is just terrific for those type of characters. And with the lovely Olivia Williams making a great performance as the love desire of Max and Herman. Also i like the cameo of Luke Wilson ,as a friend of Rosemary Cross, and the one of Kumar Pallana who plays Pagoda in \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" and appears in almost all the films of Anderson.Conclusion: it's true that this particular style of Anderson is not for all the people, i mean, or you love all of his films or you hate all. I love his style so i really love this film that is my second favourite of him and a total original comedy that might be a little slow for mainstream audiences but trust me, you will enjoy every second. For films like this one, i can say that Cinema is my Rushmore. 10 out of 10",

            "content": "There is a sequence in the Wes Anderson-directed \"Rushmore\" where a student Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) dreams of solving a maths problem which no one in the world has the brains to solve. Watch the sequence carefully for two reasons : It's way too real and that's the funniest sequence in this comedy-drama. \"Rushmore\" is an offbeat comedy that has the power to make your day if you enjoy the genre but can leave you feeling disappointed if you don't.15-year-old Max Fischer is the most famous student of Rushmore, a private school in which he is largely involved in almost all of the extracurricular activities and flunks in most of the subjects when it comes to academics. When he's put on academic probation because of his poor grades, he finds a reason to return to Rushmore when he develops a massive crush on a teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). Oblivious to him, his friend Herman Blume (Bill Murray), a wealthy businessman, is also in love with her. The film follows the story of how Max tries to resolve the situation after he learns of Blume's feelings while trying to win Cross' heart.The film has a bit of an odd setting because you can't figure out why Anderson has so many characters in the movie if he just wanted to focus on the love triangle. I found myself questioning the need of so many characters if the plot follows the story of just three of them. You don't know where Anderson's getting at with the plot and by the time you almost stop caring, the sub-plot kicks in and the film escalates into a romance.But \"Rushmore\" has got those few moments of genuine humor that you can't help but fall for its charm. The characters, though many, are superbly etched out. The innovative screenplay, jointly written by Anderson and Owen Wilson, is supremely funny in parts. There are these moments where I allowed myself a hearty laugh, like the one where Max tries to get Rosemary Cross fired when he learns that she too has feelings for Blume only to find out that she has already resigned and his plan has backfired.Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and Olivia Williams, in their respective roles, are top-notch. The character of Max is oddly likable although you can't shake off the feeling that he was someone you didn't expect to like or wasn't someone who was supposed to turn out the way he has. Schwartzman portrays Max as a stubborn, flimsy human-being and does it with aplomb. I'm not quite sure I understood how the characters of Max and Herman Blume develop a firm friendship. Bill Murray, one of the best actors of his generation, sleepwalks through his role. His performance is controlled, expressive and easy to relate to.All in all, \"Rushmore\" is greatly flawed but it has got its heart in the right place. There are a few scenes in the film which look as if they've been pulled straight out of your life. The plot skims through many genres but ultimately settles for a deeply-felt drama from a talented director. Watch it, if not for anything else, for those quirky moments which make you feel as if you have been in these situations with people like these saying stuff like that.",

Nowadays his movies like Grand Budapest Hotel and the very recent The French Dispatch are very special and not that commercial. But Rushmore still is commercial and follows a structured plot.The young student falls in love with a teacher from his school. His relationship to other students and a teacher named Mr. Blume, played by Bill Murray, are a big part of the whole movie. The protagonist tries to impress in front of his big love, but it causes different problems. In general we see a coming of age story, compared with dramatic and comedy parts. Especially younger people can identify with the main character. It's pretty often that young people feel attracted to older man or woman. Anderson plays with this phenomenon and tries to bring it to the viewer with school stereotypes and sarcasm. It's always very fascinating for me, how young directors, as Anderson back at the days, get such good actors and different songs on there soundtrack. The Rushmore soundtrack features songs from Cat Stevens, Faces, The Who, The Kinks and more.All in all Rushmore is one of the best Anderson movie's for me.",

For someone like me, who has always been weary of Anderson's deep stylization, \"Rushmore's\" stable nature is a good thing.The movie centers on fifteen-year-old Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), a prep school student with ambition in all the wrong places. He is a member of over a dozen clubs, but is simultaneously failing his classes. Max becomes smitten with a new teacher at the school (Olivia Williams), but the plot thickens when one of his classmates' dad (Bill Murray) falls for that same woman. They vie over her affection in a story that offers a unique take on adolescent pain and joy.\"Rushmore\" plays like a John Hughes movie, but with a quirky dash of genre-bending. It is part teen movie, part comedy, and part melodrama. This trifecta does not feel overbearing, however, as the tone never shifts incredulously. The characters may not be the most lovable people throughout, but we still empathize with their emotions, and their redemption in the end is worth cheering for.I also like the movie on a visual level, at least compared to most Anderson movies. For people who relish in the other-worldly sharp aesthetic of \"The Grand Budapest Hotel,\" \"Moonrise Kingdom,\" or \"The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou,\" \"Rushmore\" doesn't have quite the same flare. Nevertheless, I really appreciate how \"Rushmore\" feels of this universe. Maybe this is because cameras in the late nineties were not fine-tuned enough to support Anderson's vibrant vision; or maybe the director still needed more time to become the bold artisan he is today.Still, a lot of Wes Anderson's trademark cinematographic moves are there in \"Rushmore,\" but he executes them rather quietly. Other than the occasional curtain-closing over the frame to signify a transition, there is not a lot of distraction on-camera.I actually wish that Wes Anderson remained this subtle in his subsequent movies. By-and-large, I still enjoy his screenplays, but his flamboyant style often takes me out of the stories. \"Rushmore\" is funny, relatable, and touching, supported by some spot-on performances and a well-measured degree of artistry.",

            "content": "AT first it's mere coming of age. It's rebellion tinged with melancholy for all those accomplishments, or involvements the intellectual so often avoids. Then it becomes a film about first love, about letting go of childhood and merging with horns blazing into the traffic of the adult world.With Wes Anderson's superb soundtrack, and thematic grace, we witness the progression of a brilliant, yet ever so \"dull\" student, find redemption in unrequited love and an existence beyond the structure that academia so readily provides.What is life other than the mutual grace of friendship, betrayal and ultimate self-discovery? We kill the child to become the man, to quote a man much wiser than myself. We find ourselves through the massive attack against our cloistered egos at high school. How many popular kids have become the clich\u00e9d remnants of suburban lawn-care? How many \"losers\" have found the medium of their success through multiple failures? What I love about this film is that it portrays love at it's most vulnerable, at it's most pernicious. The friend betraying the friend. The reconciliation, and the realization that love is transitory and a construct of the male psyche - the dominance they crave, the possession they find necessary - only to be obviated by the strict reality of real love premised on non-competition and compassion.One of the best films of the twentieth century.",

'Rushmore' is one of the freshest and most inventive movies made in recent years, and one that gives hope to jaded movie lovers everywhere. Arguably nothing has come close to it since 'Boogie Nights', if not 'Pulp Fiction'. All three movies are sure to be recognized one day as modern classics.Everything about this movie works. The acting, direction, editing, dialogue, even use of music (and who would have thought they'd ever hear The Creation, The Faces and live Who in a movie?! VERY cool move!). Jason Schwartzman may never do anything else of note, who knows, but he is perfect as Max Fischer over-achieving misfit schoolboy. Bill Murray gives his finest performance as Max's friend (and subsequent rival), and Olivia Williams is lovely as the object of their affections. All three are supported by a flawless cast which includes memorable roles for Brian Cox (the original and best Hannibal Lector) and Cassavetes/Buscemi favourite Seymour Cassel.\nA superb movie that I wholeheartedly recommend!",

            "content": "This amusing film traces the exploits of an awkward adolescent, Max Fischer (played by Jason Schwartzman), and his love-hate friendship with eccentric millionaire Herman Blume (brilliantly played by Bill Murray). Herman Blume takes the young  Max Fischer under his rather unconventional wing as Max navigates pressing issues like adolescence and world domination (not necessarily in that order). Both lead characters, Max and Blume, are a complex mix of contradictions. Max rails against his exclusive school's status quo, but wants to belong to it more than anything else. He exposes the predictably thick school bully, but his behaviour is only marginally better than those he reproaches. The wealthy industrialist, Herman Blume, becomes more of a playmate and romantic rival for Max rather than a mentor. Chain smoking in a hospital elevator and serving alcohol to a minor are just some of Blume's many transgressions. \"Rushmore\" is so well-cast that these exceptional and extreme personalities are loveable while being unlikable. Bill Murray brings surprising depth to the character of the indulgent Herman Blume. Any lessor actor would reduce the character to a caricature, but Murray brings warmth and unflagging good humor to the role. Schwartzman takes on a huge challenge in his first movie role, and succeeds. If genetics counts for anything in acting, Schwartzman is destined for stardom. There is a staggering number of Oscars in the branches of his family. His parents are actress Talia Shire and late producer Jack Schwartzman. His cousin is actor Nicolas Cage and his uncle is famed director Francis Ford Coppola. Jason Schwartzman brings a non-actor's freshness to the character of Max and is a perfect foil for Bill Murray.Wes Anderson, the film's talented director shines in his sophomore effort (his debut was the low-budget indie, \"Bottle Rocket\").  With \"Rushmore\", Anderson seems to approach the process of entertaining others with a tongue-in-cheek wink at its' audience. The \"Rushmore\" soundtrack is wonderfully sprinkled with not-so-famous 1960s-era music (Like The Who's \"A Quick One\") and the film's pace is reminiscent of 1960s British films like \"Georgy Girl\". This film may have been mislabeled as a teen comedy but \"Rushmore\" is no private-school version \"American Pie.\" The jokes are smaller and more poignant. For example, anyone with any strong sense of irony would have to appreciate watching Max make the gritty cop drama \"Serpico\" into a memorable high school play. \"Rushmore\" triumphs in its little moments and it is definitely worth viewing.",

            "content": "I had heard about this film a little bit, including one of its stars, then I found it in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I looked forward to whatever it had to offer, directed by Wes Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Grand Budapest Hotel). Basically Max Fischer (Saving Mr. Banks' Jason Schwartzman) is a mature and eccentric fifteen year old scholarship student at Rushmore Academy, a private school in Houston, he is the most extracurricular and least scholarly student, he spends most of his time running many school groups and cares little about his grades. Herman Blume (Golden Globe nominated Bill Murray) is a disillusioned industrialist who is unsatisfied with his multimillion dollar company's operation, his marriage failing is frustrating him, and his two sons attending Rushmore are brats, he becomes close friends with Max, admiring his cocksure attitude, Max admires Herman's success. Max quickly develops an infatuation with widowed teacher Rosemary Cross (The Sixth Sense's Olivia Williams), the new arrival at the academy, he attempts to court her many times, she slowly realises his obsession for her, Herman tries to convince him she is not worth the effort, but Herman, without Max's knowledge, begins dating her himself. Without the school's approval, Max tries to break ground on an aquarium, he ends up getting expelled from Rushmore, forcing him to enrol in Grover Cleveland High, his first public school, he has mixed results engaging in outside activities, he pays little attention to fellow student Margaret Yang (Sara Tanaka) who tries to engage with him, but he has support from Herman and Rosemary. Max's friend Dirk Calloway (Dennis's Mason Gamble) wants payback for a rumour Max spread about his mother, he discovers the relationship between Herman and Rosemary and informs Max, therefore Max and Herman go from friends to mortal enemies, engaging in back-and-forth acts of revenge. This includes Max ending Blume's marriage informing his wife of his affair, Max putting bees in Blume's hotel room, Blume destroying Max's bicycle with his car, and Max getting arrested for cutting the brakes on Blume's car. Max eventually gives up on any more revenge, knowing that whatever he tries Rosemary would still love Blume, he becomes depressed, stops attending school, cuts himself from the world and becomes an apprentice at his father's barber shop, one day Dirk comes by to apologise to Max and give him a Christmas present. Max is tricked into reuniting with Herman by Dirk, going to hospital where his old headmaster is, they are courteous, and Max finds out that Herman and Rosemary broke up, shortly after Max returns to school and develops a friendship with Margaret. Max makes one last attempt to get close with Rosemary, soliciting her affection pretending she has been injured in a car accident, but she finds out the truth and rejects him harshly, so Max makes it his mission to get Rosemary and Blume back together. His first attempt at this fails, but then he invites them to a play he wrote, making sure they will sit together, in the end Rosemary and Herman seem to reconcile, Max shares a slow dance with Rosemary at the wrap party, but ultimately he finds himself a relationship with Margaret. Also starring Brian Cox as Dr. Nelson Guggenheim, Seymour Cassel as Bert Fischer, Luke Wilson as Dr. Peter Flynn and One Hour Photo's Connie Nielsen as Mrs. Calloway. This is the first film for Schwartzman, he gives a good performance as the odd megalomaniacal nerd, Williams is likable as the British teacher, and Murray does steal most of the scenes he is in as the depressed millionaire being quirky and edgy. It is a rather simple format, the unconventional outsider teen hero who may have the ability to turn those who laugh or are against him, it has intriguing characters and interactions, and a witty script, I did find myself laughing at the right moments and it was interesting, it's a black comedy drama worth watching.

This is because it's not what, but whom it's about that is important.\n\"Rushmore\" is about Max Fischer, an impossibly ambitious high school student attending \"one of the best schools in the country,\" according to his friend, steel tycoon herman blume. Max is involved in the greatest possible amount of extracurricular activities and athletics he can be in and still survive, let alone maintain decent grades. He does fall in love, but love is just yet another driving ambition for Max. Ultimately he comes to terms with his own limitations without succumbing to mediocrity. Max is my hero in the truest sense of the word. You may not laugh at Rushmore, even though you'll find it in the comedy section. You especially won't laugh if you watch it alone. although you'll probably acknowledge that it's a comedy you may not be able to pick out one individual joke. I can't explain why I still love it so much, so this is meant as a warning: if you expect madcap laugh-out-loud funny, you may be sorely disappointed. I myself do laugh at Rushmore because I share that kind of sense of humor with the writers. It's not for everyone though. I judge people's personalities on whether or not they enjoy \"Rushmore.\" If they don't, no big deal, but it's a girl I wouldn't marry her.\nI intentionally didn't start by saying that \"Rushmore\" is my favorite film, because it often discredits a reviewer immediately. If you find that you enjoy it you may also find, as i did, that it is entertaining after numerous viewings, or in my case, viewing ad nauseum. I watch it at least once a week, and have for, i'd say, six months. although i've been watching it fairly regularly for three years this makes me crazy. i know.A friend of mine watched the film for the first time not long ago. She told me that when she looked at Max, she saw me. I wouldn't intentionally pattern my life after a movie, but apparently it can happen. See \"Rushmore\" whomever you are. If you hate it, you'll enjoy hating it. I know, because I've sat many people through it, and the discussions afterwards were at least worth their time. More likely though, if you bothered to read this entire review which was more about myself than the movie, you'll love it. \"You'll love it,\" is not how I want to end this review so I'll lie in the next paragraph in case someone only reads the last line.\"Rushmore\" features extended scenes of full frontal female nudity.

            "content": "\"Rushmore\" is the kind of comedy that just isn't all that funny. It is well made, and does contain a few momentous comic fires, but never enough to recommend of that genre. Its really more dramatic though not much. Some audiences may find the material quite bleak, while others may think it is obscured. Doubtless, not many people will find it raveable.The film's protagonist is a trouble making student at the Rushmore Academy named Max Fischer, one of the greatest schools in America. He loves where he goes to school, more than anything. He gets poor grades, but is apart of many clubs/teams. In a particular scene he states that Rushmore is his life. This un-realistic lust for schooling is necessary for developing the character's personality which latter carries the dim plot though turmoil.After the Max character is fully understood, we begin to receive plot clinches of all sorts. First, Max is threatened with \"sudden death expulsion\" since he is such a bad student. Second, he ominously falls in love with a first grade teacher who also works at Rushmore. Her name is Miss Cross. Then Max begins to do very strange things, like building an aquarium in replacement of the school's baseball diamond. Not your typical student, this is how he gets expelled from Rushmore and gets sent to another school.The film's antagonist is Mr. Blume (Bill Murray), who is an old grumpy, almost full time drunk, mentor who works at Rushmore. He also loves Miss. Cross, which eventually leads to an affair involving the two. Max then becomes jealous and serious, and at times, dangerous conflicts result. Though Max and Mr. Blume are close friends. In many scenes Mr. Blume and Max both refer to one another as \"friends\". The film starts out promising and different, then kinda downfalls. It goes downhill from the point where he meets Margaret Yang, then when she becomes more in the story. The last few scenes at the play are rather boring and dull and could have been much better. I also didn't like the ending too much.As a rewatch 06/09/22' and nearly 10 years since the initial watch, most opinions remain same. As this rewatch, forgot a lot of key details. Rushmore is quite the offbeat coming of age film with very solid acting. Although the film does remain interesting once Max goes to the public school. There are small details had not noticed before. Very good film, we can see some of the very best work from Wes Anderson.",

It is a film I didn't care for on first viewing (I thought the characters were simply awkward constructs of the writer/director), but decided to see it again after having enjoyed The Royal Tenenbaums. This time I definitely felt much more in tune with the director's bizarre brilliance. Rushmore is about Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), an unusual high school student who underachieves in classes at Rushmore, an exclusive prep school, and is under constant threat of expulsion because he spends all of his time a litany of extracurricular activities. With Max, Wes Anderson has developed a character that is highly intelligent, very creative, yet a lonely underachiever unable to deal with the expectations of society (similar in a way to Donnie Darko, another character who is brilliant yet unfocused).Max becomes infatuated with pretty first grade teacher Rosemary. Cross (Olivia Williams), and enlists the aid of his friend Herman Blume (Bill Murray), a millionaire industrialist, to build an aquarium at the school in Ms. Cross's honor. By forgetting to tell the school administrators about the aquarium, Max is expelled from Rushmore and attends the local public school. He goes into virtual combat with the much older Blume, determined to conquer his foe and win his lady's hand.Rushmore is very human and charming. Max reminded me a little of myself at a point in my life that I was able to laugh at my own vanity and pretensions. With great performances and an outstanding soundtrack, Rushmore is a thoroughly engaging film from a director who, for me, fits the phrase \"comic genius\".",

            "content": "No coming-of-age film, before or since \"Rushmore,\" has been so intellectual and yet so gleefully immature. Wes Anderson's sophomore effort remains one of his best for its unorthodox depiction of teen angst, which sees 15-year-old private prodigy Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) deal with academic probation, fall for an older woman and form an unlikely friendship with a school parent.Anderson brings a certain indelible spirit to his work that frankly has no equal, and \"Rushmore\" stands among the finest examples of his playful attitude and wealth of artistic knowledge, if for no other reason than the familiarity of the film's school setting. Max is a rogue and a brat, but a genius in his own right; he simply puts his skills to use in all the wrong applications. He represents all of us who were misunderstood high school students, yet also the smart ass that everyone despises \u2014 at the same time.It takes a certain young man to epitomize both the height of teenage pretension and the baseness of teenage mischief \u2013 not to mention match wits with Bill Murray. A sure sign of what would be a long Hollywood career, Schwartzman goes toe to toe with Murray, who plays Herman Blume, a local industrialist who takes a liking to Max, a mentorship that soon turns to rivalry.Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson craft a familiar but exaggerated world in \"Rushmore.\" Max cannot be president of two dozen clubs, or stage elaborate plays with explosions in no time at all, but the mere suggestions provide a comedic underpinning for a story of a student so extra-curricularly driven that he's failing school, and how his middle class background (unlike his wealthy classmates) factors in. And there's his blind love of Ms. Cross (Olivia Williams) juxtaposed with the fact that he lost his mother when he was young. So for as silly as \"Rushmore\" gets, at its core is about people, young and old, who have experienced loss and are trying to grapple with \"sic transit gloria mundi,\" how quickly the world changes around them. Anderson and Wilson bury this in a lot of fluff, but the fluff isn't frivolous \u2013 it contributes to Anderson's unusual (though now familiar and much acclaimed) tone.Like any teen movie worth its salt, \"Rushmore\" makes great use of its soundtrack, creating a renegade, anti-authority vibe that fittingly misrepresents what the film is all about, adding another layer of comedic value. The entire film is littered with cultural references both familiar and obscure \u2013 it's what makes Anderson esoteric but also so appealing to certain film fans.It can be easy to lose \"Rushmore\" in this thicket of style and references at times, but many more features into Anderson's filmography, it still feels among his most accessible. This is a familiar story populated with familiar people, as larger than life as it all gets, and Anderson often likes to venture out there. \"Rushmore\" is a nice home base to return to for devoted fans and casual admirers both.~Steven CThanks for reading!

It doesn't matter how different the plots are, how diverse the characters are, or even if it's live action or animated...they all share the exact same tone. It's so pronounced that I swear you could shuffle scenes from all his movies together and it would take a long while before you would notice something was wrong. If you're a big fan of the Wes Anderson aesthetic, then I imagine none of this bothers you, and Rushmore is one more wonderful treat. However, I'm not that enamored with it, and therefore I get somewhat bored with most of his movies (when I'm not actively annoyed by them.) I've said before that the style of his films make them feel like they were made by an alien who is trying to imitate their perception of life on Earth. It has the bones of a human story, but no one acts normal, and there are oddities in the way the movie world functions that don't quite line up with reality. Of course his movies look amazing, because Wes Anderson is all about painstakingly working out the details, but they lack humanity.Rushmore is more of the same, and doesn't bring anything new or interesting for me to enjoy. Thankfully, it's not one of the Wes Anderson movies that frustrates me, because most of the characters are pleasant enough and the plot is harmless. There are certainly moments where I find Jason Schwartzman to be irritating, but the story is presenting him in a negative fashion in those scenes, so that's acceptable. Bill Murray doesn't get enough to do in order to save the film. He has some moments of comedy that work, but this is more Schwartzman's movie. Rushmore is such a strange film because it never seems clear whether the main character is a good student or a bad one, all we know is he's overly ambitious and likes to organize extracurricular activities. When we see him getting a C- I don't know whether that's good for him or terrible. I'm also a bit puzzled by how he has avoided constant bullying since he is such a tedious know-it-all. As with many other Wes Anderson movies, I find Rushmore to be an acceptable way to pass the time and nothing more. It's certainly not a movie I'd ever need to revisit since I've seen plenty of his films before, and can get the same experience from any of them.",

For me, it's going to Rushmore.\"Rushmore feels slightly different from Wes Anderson's other movies. It still has his trademark style, dialogue, and memorable characters, certainly. But there isn't as much of his normal focus on visually interesting sets, and the characters feel more lovable.\u00a0Their flaws aren't as self-destructive as the characters in The Royal Tenenbaums or The Darjeeling Limited. Young Max (Jason Schwartzman, cleverly handling a character who somehow manages to be both an\u00a0underachiever AND an overachiever), his chosen infatuation, Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), and his disaffected older friend Mr. Blume (Bill Murray) aren't perfect, but Anderson chooses to make them less quirky than is his usual habit.\u00a0It's an interesting decision which changes the tone of the movie somewhat, but if you like most of Anderson's other work, this will probably be right up your alley, too. It's an endearing little movie about life and finding what makes it all worth it for you, and I enjoyed it.",

            "content": "I should start this review by saying that I had very high hopes for this movie when I went in.  I have read countless times that this movie is a masterpiece that will be remembered as a classic for years to come.  That was what I had read, and that was what I expected.  I suppose if I hadn't heard anything about the movie, I may have liked it more, but as it turned out, I wasn't all that impressed.Granted, the film did have some very good moments.  I would have loved to see some more of the school plays put on by the lead character, Max Fischer. They showed two of them, and they were both hilarious.  I won't ruin what they were, but they were both highlights of the film.I also really liked the interaction between the two leads, Max and the character played by Bill Murray (I can't remember the characters full name, but his last name was Blume).  They worked very well together, and both of the characters were intriguing, eccentric, and well developed.  Introducing Max with clips of him in all of the various clubs he had founded was a nice touch, as was his beginning dream sequence.  His exaggerated school spirit was an interesting counterpoint to his academic disabilities.What I didn't like so much was the script.  There really seemed to be no point to this movie, as far as I could tell.  The basic plot concerns Max, a 15 year old, falling in love with a much older, first grade teacher. Eventually, Max's friend, Bill Murray's character, also falls in love with her.  What follows is essentially a contest between the two for the love of this teacher.  Some of it could have been the basis for a good, dark comedy, but some of it was just plain stupid.  Watching Bill Murray run over Max's bike.  Ho-hum.  What does that have to do with getting the girl?The screen-writers didn't really go anywhere with this plot.  I suppose that the point of the movie was simply to introduce these two quirky characters to the world, but with the expectations I had set, I would have liked more.So, am I recommending this film or not?  Yes, and no.  It is definitely worth seeing, once you've seen everything else that's out.  Don't go out of your way to see it, but if you do, it's an o.k. way to kill a couple of hours, and you could do a lot worse.",

            "content": "This is where Anderson really got into his rhythm. Bottle Rocket was admittedly a little mellow; the characters were petty criminals but it felt like we were being pushed to like them, to embrace their endearing qualities. Here, Anderson toes the line ever so closely with Max Fischer, the 15 year old subversion of the teacher's pet who is one of the worse students at Rushmore Academy, but gets an A+ for extracurricular activities. He's a bit of a pompous asshole but he thinks he's god's gift to the private school; \"We don't offer it yet,\" he so quick-wittedly corrects the headmaster. He didn't gain acceptance at the prestigious academy because of academic success, but because he wrote a \"little one act about Watergate\" and has since taken over the drama club. Max Fischer seems to think that because he is the president of so many successful clubs (in his mind), because he can speak a few lines of Latin, and because he brought Cross' classroom to life with her own little aquarium it makes him mature enough for an relationship with her. This is of course not true, but still he persists pass the boundaries of appropriateness. What Max seems to be doing iv vicariously overcompensating for his lack of parental support; he is like a stand in parent himself, giving haircuts, making conversation with the mums of the students, bossing around his actors like rowdy little children. He convinces himself he is not like the ramble that is Herman's children. His father is only a lowly hairdresser, so he constructs his own little world to replace his disappointment. He tricks Cross with fake blood in order to stage a moment of intimacy. When Margaret Yang casually admits that she lied about her science project, it visibly shocks Max into a change. Would Max, up to that point, ever admit something that he perceives as vulnerable and disarming? There is no place for weakness or underachievement in his life. When he joins his cast on-stage for the round of applause, with the pseudo-artistic broken nose for good measure, the moment is slowed down to soak in all his glory. When he gives a cordial speech to his new public schoolmates, the camera slowly zooms until he is the only one occupying the frame. This is the Max Fischer show after all.What Rushmore excels at is balancing the two dilemmas of Max and indeed the older Herman Blume. They both are chasing the same woman, but while their ages are years apart, they are both remarkably childlike and immature about the whole affair. They descend to tricks and sabotage and underhanded gestures in order to get ahead of the race, and are both quite self centred. There's a moment when Max introduces Herman to his father and his barbershop, after all the lies about him being a hotshot surgeon (\"My father may only be a doctor, but we manage\"), where Max finally shows some humility and unveils what his life really is like, and Murray's reaction is just fantastically telling. It's an obvious turning point for the man who seems to be a perfect prototype for an older Max had he not gone through the film's events - crotchety, lonely, for so long basking in the shallow vanity of his own achievements until he hits breaking point and begins self-loathing. 10 million? Guess so. It's not until Max admits his flaws that Herman can too. This is also the film where Anderson really embraced his own stylistic tendencies. The opening montage of all the different clubs Max is part of, with matching text, is as vivid and engaging as any introduction to a Wes Anderson character. There are only brief snapshots but he uses the compositions of those group portraits to their fullest extent in order to portray Max as a person who isn't in it for the enjoyment or camaraderies but for personal achievement. It is also his first film to use the intertitle to chop up the segments of time; parting stage curtains emblazoned with the passing months creates a sense of precise direction, as if it was Max overseeing the production with his own obsession with perfection and control. It just feels a whole lot more confident than Bottle Rocket. There's the lateral and horizontal camera movement at hard 90 degree angles that he has become know for; see the long-take follow shot unveiling Max's takeover of the baseball field as if he owns the place and is entitled to it, and his many lonely wanderings in the school hallways and ground. See how Max and Rosemary stare down the camera as they talk to each other, with a feigned sense of intimacy that I'm sure is very real in Max's mind. The slow motion and curtain close is used in the final scene. It is serenaded by The Face's Ooh La La, which I think is very fitting. This also marks, in my opinion, Anderson's blossoming ability to choose the most appropriate song for his films. Max is a different kind of mature now, but don't we all wish we could return to that one moment with the knowledge and experience of now? In his first kind-of-romance, he learns some harsh lessons, but is able to take those with him into the future. Glory fades, but underneath is a 15 year old boy with a lot more to him than just the clubs he heads.",

            "content": "I don't know if an adolescent audience is going to find it easy to identify with Jason Schwarzman as the terribly bright, candid, and assertive kid who quietly gets himself into trouble by breaking the rules at Rushmore Academy and at the same time falling for one of its math teachers, the appealing Olivia Williams.For one thing, the kid loves the prep school. He has an academic scholarship, even though his Pappy, a neurosurgeon, could probably afford to buy the entire school. He stages hit plays. He's an alternate on the wrestling team. He's a genius when he's not being driven mad by his love for his teacher or the stings of the jocks or the competition from Bill Murray as a mogul who, with no explication, falls in love with Olivia Williams too. Nowadays, he said despondently, academic work elicits a big yawn. In a sociology class I was describing the ways polls have gone wrong and was interrupted by, \"Is this going to be on the test?\" I can understand the appeal of Olivia Williams. She's luminous. And I can understand why a high-school kid might be desperate for her love but, after all, if he's so smart he should be able to figure out that the slight difference in their ages, perhaps twenty years, might be an impediment.All the parts are pretty well written. (The story seems, in part at least, to be based on the experiences of Owen Wilson -- actor, writer, and all-around handyman.) Bill Murray, for instance, plays the role in his stiff, robotic mode, with few changes of expression. When he realizes he's falling for a younger woman he proves his boyish recklessness by launching his shapeless body from the high diving board. He hits like a cannonball and immediately sinks to the bottom and stays there. At another time, he leaps to the top of a chest-high hurricane fence, rolls over it, and falls helplessly to the ground on the other side.I didn't much care for the central figure of Max Fischer. Not that Schwartzman plays him badly; he doesn't. But the ambitious and sometimes obnoxious character, given to casual bragging and insults that are supposed to pass for honesty, is powerfully repellent.The film moves at a casual pace. There are just the right pauses between utterances and before cuts. The audience can not only follow what's happening but can savor the moments if they're any good. The sound track is mostly easy-listening rock instead of an electronic jumble. It's so nice to watch a comedy about kids that you don't need a Xanax to prepare for.",

Frankly, I've see better student films (and these are HIGH SCHOOL student films).  I have found that the best movies have a clear goal, good writing, strong performances, and a director that knows what he/she is doing.

I love him the same way i love Fellini, who also creates such worlds in his movies.In Rushmore, this world captures the delightful unreality and nostalgia of one's memories of one's highschool days.Its whole atmosphere is unreal - often it feels like a school play, which seems intentional owing to the framing devices of curtains coming across the screen and giving intertitles (November, December, etc) and the fact that the main character writes school plays.Rushmore is a very different kind of movie, and like with Wes Anderson's followup, The Royal Tenenbaums, your enjoyment of it seems to vary depending on what your expectations of it are. In it you'll find a very Shakespearean marriage of tragedy and comedy, which will neither make you cry or make you laugh out loud the way frivolous, silly teen comedies may do (though many people laugh out loud at Rushmore - i think i did every now and then - what i'm saying is that its quality as a picture needn't be judged by the amount of times you laugh out loud, because it isn't going for that tone).Sporting a great soundtrack of classic songs, a quirky atmosphere and Wes Anderson's distinctive visual style, Rushmore is an original, enjoyable movie, bound to have a cult following everywhere it goes.",

Having previously seen 'The Royal Tenenbaums' and 'Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou' I wanted to give 'Rushmore' (Anderson's first film -- if you don't count the miserably unsuccessful 'Bottle Rocket') a shot. I can tell you that I really liked 'Rushmore' but I didn't quite think it was \"pure brilliance\". I personally liked 'Rushmore' more then 'Life Aquatic' but for me it didn't even compare to the outstanding 'Royal Tenenbaums'. 'Rushmore' is a movie with a wholly original plot that is filled with quotable dialogue, unlikable characters and a strange feeling of neurosis.'Rushmore' is the tale of a brilliant young genius Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) who is failing all of his classes at a prestigious private school (Rushmore) because he is involved or the president of every extra-curricular activity the school has to offer. One day Max gets expelled from school after trying to impress a third grade teacher whom he has a deep crush on (Olivia Williams - The Sixth Sense) who falls for Max's employer Herman (Bill Murray) an unhappily married man with two moronic kids who attend Rushmore. Max tries to win over the third grade teacher, destroy Herman and make the best out of his time spent at a \"public\" school. The film also stars Seymour Cassell, Brian Cox and a small role played by Luke Wilson.'Rushmore' is one hell of a funny movie, but it's just so damn weird. Jason Schwartzman is perfectly cast as the total nerd that is Max Fischer. Olivia Williams is solid while Bill Murray steals the entire film in a performance of such comedic brilliance it should have earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination at 1998's Academy Awards. Wes Anderson does a nice job directing it, while him and Owen Wilson provide a perfectly eccentric, grim and off-the-wall screenplay. 'Rushmore' is a great film but not a masterpiece. It's very funny but it could have been funnier. One thing it doesn't run out of though is awkward moments. Oh, man, does it have enough of those. If you get the chance to, definitely make time to watch Wes Anderson's 'Rushmore'. If you have a flair for off-beat kind of cinema you may just get a kick out of it. Grade: B+",

            "content": "\"The secret, I don't know... I guess you've just gotta find something you love to do and then... do it for the rest of your life. For me, it's going to Rushmore.\"The Royal Tenenbaums has always been my favorite Wes Anderson movie and I always thought it was because it was the first one of his that I had seen, but it can officially move over now because I have a new favorite: Rushmore. This film was so charming, the soundtrack so cool, and the characters so well developed that I was completely in love with it once the credits started rolling. Not only is it my favorite Wes Anderson film, but it also belongs on my all time favorite list as well. I am a sucker for coming of age stories and this was a great one with perhaps one of Anderson's best developed characters from all his filmography: Max Fischer. All of Anderson's films have a similar style with offbeat and quirky themes and a hyper reality where the characters sometimes resemble those we imagine in our heads when we are reading a fantasy book. At times they are hard to connect with because they seem to belong in another time and place, but Wes manages to draw us into his world kind of like in the same way we are drawn to a theater play. That is why I also loved the special touches from Anderson as he incorporates school plays with wonderful productions into his movies. I think Rushmore is his most complete film with a charming ending, a memorable odd couple pairing, and a weird love triangle that features some of Anderson's most romantic work (similar in that sense to Moonrise Kingdom). As much as I enjoyed his first film, Bottle Rocket, it was Rushmore where he truly defines and finds his style with those production designs that seem taken from a stage play or a colorful children's book (especially seen in the scenes where Max visits the principal's office). I absolutely fell in love with Rushmore and this will be the measuring stick for Wes Anderson's films from now on.This wonderful and witty screenplay written by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson begins with a dream sequence where Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is in math class solving an extremely difficult equation and thus saving his classmates from ever having to open a math book again. His friend, Dirk (Mason Gamble), awakes him just before a millionaire industrialist named Herman Blue (Bill Murray) is about to begin his chapel speech. He has two sons in Rushmore Academy, one of the most expensive and prestigious schools in the country. Max is fascinated by this man's speech and so at the end he introduces himself to Herman and the two form a special bond together. Max is in love with Rushmore and his entire life revolves around the school and he finds in Herman someone who has achieved the success he's aiming for, while Herman is a disillusioned man who has lost his purpose in life and sees in Max someone determined who enjoys life. Up to this point one would think Max is the perfect student, but the school's headmaster, Dr. Guggenheim (Brian Cox) explains to Herman that he actually is the worst scholarly student due to his involvement in dozens of extracurricular activities (such as being the editor of the school newspaper, president of the chess, astronomy, beekeeping, and French clubs, captain of the fencing team, and director of the school play). Unlike the rest of the students, Max isn't a wealthy kid, his father Bert (Seymour Cassel) is a barber, so he's a scholarship student that is about to lose it due to his bad grades. Max and Herman's friendship is tested when they both fall in love with the widowed first grade teacher, Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). This is were the thin line between friends and enemies begin as Max and Herman begin a feud over Miss Cross.What makes Rushmore stand out above other Wes Anderson films (I have liked all of them) is the great pairing of Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray's characters. Both of them, despite having completely opposite personalities, complete each other because they see in each other what they want to become. Max aspires to be successful in life and doesn't want to become a barber like his father (that is why he always lies about his profession), while Herman despite having it all is completely disillusioned with his marriage and spoiled children. Max's passion for life is what captivates Herman because it is what he has lost. This bond is broken once Rosemary enters the picture and they both become infatuated with winning her love. Max will do anything for her, including building a giant aquarium in the school's baseball diamond or directing a successful play. Max is my favorite character despite not being entirely likable, while Murray's portrayal of Herman is sensational. He delivers one of his best and most memorable performances and shines in each scene he shares with Max or Rosemary. There are several hilarious lines and quirky moments that also balanced out perfectly with the more subtle emotional and romantic ones. This film has a lot of heart and Anderson really delivers here with his unique style (a lot of his trademarks can be found here like the slow-motion and wide angle shots, the inclusion of at least one Rolling Stones song on the soundtrack, the underwater shot, and the influence of the Charlie Brown cartoon). It's an inspired film and Anderson creates a unique world that at times seems distant from reality, but somehow he manages to create these rich characters that are easy to identify with or relate to in such a way that they manage to touch us without being overly sentimental.",

            "content": "Films that manage to create character identification for unsympathetic characters are rare and, I find, frequently profound.  Sadly, for me, \"Rushmore\" is not such a film.  Max, the main character, is not only unsympathetic, but is almost thoroughly unlikable.  He is offensive to most people he meets, has no goals that might justify his nastiness, has virtually no interests, and really has no admirable qualities.  And the one thing he is allegedly good at (writing plays) occurs totally offscreen.  We never see him working on plays, agonizing over them, figuring out his plots and characters; in fact, his writing seems to have little affect on his life at all until he appears with a completed script.  (In my mind, the screenwriters of \"Rushmore\" used Max's writing, as well as his relationship to his dead mother, as a sort of half-baked character attribute that they never put sufficient effort into fleshing out.)  Worst of all, Max never changes (for better, or for worse.)  He doesn't really learn anything or move anywhere, and he doesn't appreciably affect anyone's life.While I enjoyed Bill Murray's performance, I was continually distracted by the implausibility of a 45 year old man forming an intimate friendship with a high school student.  Such a relationship is certainly not impossible. However, the film offers no credible reasons for its formation.  Moreover, in the days in which we live, it is inconceivable to me that a middle aged man with no adult friends can hang with a teen ager without raising some very real questions (not to mention a few eyebrows!)  Of course these are not issues that a bold film would ignore, but Rushmore does just thatc, and in my mind that is just plain laziness (or incompetence) on the part of the filmmakers.For me, Rushmore is about impotent, directionless, rebellion.  Sure it's charismatic and chock full of energy, even touching for a while.  But for those of us beyond puberty, the \"angry young man\" character gets boring pretty quickly unless that energy goes somewhere, unless something original is developed from it; and, in Rushmore, this does not happen.",

There were moments in Rushmore when I thought that things were getting unpleasant. But that's when the film would pull another of its unexpected plot twists and believe me this movie has plenty of them. So, I found myself being pulled deeper into the Rushmore world and that is a good way to describe it. Because, this is a full blown adolescent male fantasy but not the usual testosterone laden \"wham bam thank you ma'am\" kind. No, Rushmore is a nerd fantasy extraordinare. Nothing is beyond Rushmore. Yet the film satirizes this absurd over achievement. Then it adds the twist of achievement as a cover up for ordinary beginnings. And so it goes, one good idea after another. If there is a problem with the film, it is that as an adolescent fantasy some of the older characters, the ones played by Bill Murray and Olivia Williams in particular, have moments that are not very believable. Yet I got the message that wouldn't it be cool if it could happen. And after a while I bought into it, all of these adults revolving around Rushmore and his world.\nIf all of this sounds a bit strange, I don't blame you because it is.

Throw in a unusual love triangle and you have a treat.Many people may not agree with me. You can either love his movies or completely ignore them. There is a distinct style in which the movie is presented. The main lead of the movie is the script. Written by Anderson and long time friend Owen Wilson, it is the screenplay of the movie which stands out.Max Fischer is the king of Rushmore. There is hardly any extra-curricular activity he does not do. With failing grades and increasing feelings for his teacher, max finds himself in the middle of all the action. With the inclusion of Bill Murray, the millionaire, who also develops feelings for max's teacher, the situation goes totally out of hand. What follows is how max tries to sort out his life.Brilliantly directed and written by Anderson, the movie is a little gem. If you are looking for a laugh out comedy, then it is not a wise move to watch this. What you get is underlying humour and a work of art. Bill Murray steals the show with his quirky one-liners and sombre expressions.

The main character, while quite unlikable for much of the film, is still relatable and original. The movie is his story and very much from his perspective/mindset. While narcissistic and a bit overbearing, he has dreams and ideals of what he would like to be, and essentially embodies the concept of \"fake it til you make it\". The other adults in the story are basically reacting to Max in whatever ways they can, and I think for many of them, they are not only reacting, but relating. After all, however unlikable he is, it is not difficult to empathize with him, his struggles, motivations, or actions. In this, I find my reasoning why I feel that it's a fantastic film.There are a number of moments that I laughed whole-heartedly and for the better part of the hour-and-a-half, I was curious what would happen next and where he would go from there. Of course, this film has its eccentricities and quirks, many of the same that are present in other Wes Anderson films, and I think anyone going into this in 2021 or later will surely come to expect many of these. Similarly, I can to a degree understand why people in 1999 wouldn't know how to take this movie or how to feel about its characters.In the end, I would say it's a fantastic film. The story is full of life, emotion, and can be interpreted a number of ways depending on how you empathize with the different characters. As I said, you may not like Max, but I think anyone who watches this will be hard-pressed to say that they don't like the film itself.",

As in, his comedies may not be particularly funny, but they always have some off-kilter edge to them which keeps you watching.Rushmore is a perfect example. The plot of the film makes it sound exactly like the kind of romantic comedy crap which I'd never get the slightest urge to watch, but it's also misleading. This is a romantic comedy filtered through a creative mind.One of the most interesting features of the film is that Jason Schwartzman's character is totally unlikeable. Traditionally, the role of most obnoxious character tends to go to the popular kids, Football captains etc. But in this case, the character is a geek, obsessed with chess and play - usually the sympathetic characters. In this case, he comes across as unpleasant; I assume this was intentional. Schwartzman's performance is very convincing and he is perfectly suited to the character he plays.Also great is Bll Murray, who plays a wealthy businessman friend of Schwartzman's character. You could argue that since he turned 40, Murray's been playing exactly the same style in ever film he's been in, but let's face it, it's a great style. Always, slightly depressed, never reacting to anything with any shock or surprised and brilliantly deadpan. As such, he is perfectly suited to Anderson's films.As such, there is always a serious edge to his films. In this case, I'm not sure what his point is. Maybe he just wanted to write a teen movie and went horribly off the point. Oh well, it's probably better that way. You can't help but be gripped by the film and you sympathise with the characters, no matter how horrible they may be.Overall, the main flaw is a lack of laughs. There are plenty of missed opportunities for humour throughout the film. I mean, it's not quite one of those arty films where you spend the entire time wondering when the \"comedy\" tag is going to come into effect, but it's not a laugh-a-minute fest either.Still, worth watching. I personally preferred it to the Life Aquatic, not that it was a bad movie either.Freak out!",

It seems that intention was to create a simple, fun, non pretentious film that would be characteristic of the french new wave (\"400 Blows\" and \"Pocket Change\" come to mind); however, the writer/director missed a few essential ingredients: interesting story and emotions. The reason why the viewer can't really identify him/her self with the main character is that the main character is so emotionless and painfully dull that there is hardly anything to identify with. It doesn't help that hardly any character in the film is believable. Even in the craziest comedy, characters are believable for the situation they are in. Not in \"Rushmore\". However, in the good old tradition of a popular N.American film, this film has some good acting, and pretty much everything else, except - no story to tell, idea to convey, or emotion to stir.

As for the acting, I seem to think against the grain here. Common knowledge tells you that Billy Murray gives the performance of a lifetime and that he was absolutely robbed when it comes to Oscar nominations. Often, I hear that Murray's failure to get nominated is the fault of Jason Schwartzman, who plays Max, the main character of this film. Supposedly, his character was thought so unlikable by many critics and, apparently, Academy members that Rushmore was ignored. In my opinion, Bill Murray gives a particularly forgettable performance (he has been so much better in other films) and it is Jason Schwartzman who makes the film at all worth watching.

The fact that he wasn't nominated for an Oscar ( while some guys like Geoffrey Rush from the insignificant \"Shakespeare in love\" were )just proves that some awards today are not worth 5 cents.Truth be told, the first time I saw \"Rushmore\" I was confused to say the least and was quick to dismiss it. But its images somehow stayed in my head and left me thinking. There was something in this movie that made you want to see it and judge it again, and you couldn't put your finger on it what it was. I saw \"Rushmore\" again one year later and I couldn't explain to myself the following reaction; this time it seemed almost perfect. As a matter of fact, I had a smile on my face for the whole first 30 minutes.------------------------- \"Rushmore\" is a drama/comedy and is directed in its own way. I guess many will feel uneasy because its hero is actually an antihero, a person that makes everything wrong and fails, but still has the courage to continue. My favorite line is \"O.R. they?\" Two sequences stand out from the story. One is, of course, the montage of all the clubs Max founded equipped with subtitles ( Yankee review publisher/ French club president/ model U.N. Russia / stamp and coin club vice president/ debate team captain/ Lacross team manager/ calligraphy club president/ astronomy society founder/ fencing team captain/ track and field J.V. decathlon/ 2nd chorale choirmaster/ bombardment society/ Kung Fu club yellow belt/ beekeepers president/ Yankee racers founder/ players director/ piper cub club )in combination with the great song \"Making time\" and the other one is when he is doing a salto in his new school while Cat Stevens genius song \"Here comes my baby\" is playing.On the site rotten-tomatoes.com \"Rushmore\" got a very high average grade of 8.0/10, making it the most acclaimed of all Wes Anderson films. Still, the movie is not flawless; it has emotions, but I would have loved more romantic interaction between Bill Murray and Olivia Williams and a more tightened leading hand in directing. Also, sometimes the scenes seem heavily edited and over explained. And the dark touches are a little bit over the top. Non the less, everyone here can be proud of this movie, which is one of a kind.Grade: 9/10",

Not only that, but the plot is absolutely stupid and nothing special, especially the way it is executed because it's so forced. People don't really talk or act like they do in this movie in real life. Max (the main guy) becomes best friends with Bill Murray (typical poor Bill supporting role here) and then falls for a new teacher at Rushmore. And what a surprise, Bill suddenly falls for the teacher too. We basically see Max and Bill Murray do pranks on each other, but in the end, they makeup. How cute. Meanwhile, Max tries to hook up Bill by wasting Bill's money and working on his stupid high-budget-special-effects-explosion plays. Max's play is a success and everyone is just one big happy family. Give me a break.This movie takes more time on pointless subplots than focusing/spending time on a major plot.It's obvious the director just wanted to use many of his favorite 70's songs in this movie. I think it's dumb people give high votes on the movie just because of the soundtrack.If you're one of those people who loved Donnie Darko, then you'll probably love this too because I thought both movies were just stupid and just hype. Also, if you loved the fake acting in \"Juno\" then you'll probably love the way they act in this movie too. I should have known this guy directed Royal Tenenbaums. That movie was so overrated as well, even though it had an all-star cast. I rather watch Royal Tenenbaums again than this movie, but I honestly don't understand Wes Anderson's taste.Skip it. Save your precious 1 hour and 30 minutes of life.",

            "content": "Rushmore is such a fun movie to watch, that if you are the type of individual that can relate to this film, you'll want to own it for your collection. The story is about a unique kid named Max Fisher, who seems gifted in many ways. His talents range from directing and writing live theater, to founding and/or organizing every school club- no matter how obscure.  This 40 year old in a 15 year old body is just a little out of place in school, even in his beloved private school of Rushmore. This is made clear not only by his dismal grades, but by his pursuit of a pretty and sophisticated woman, a teacher at Rushmore.  The characters of Max Fisher and the wealthy business tycoon Herman Blume, played to perfection by Bill Murray, who ends up competing with Max for the love of the teacher, are what drive this film. They are friends despite their age difference, then rivals - and it is this unusual mix that makes this film unique.  The film seems to say that people can be different and unique in life, and that they should be able to pursue love,happiness, and meaning, without giving in to society's expectations. If you feel that you're a unique person and have taken flack in your life for it, watch Rushmore, and learn to love yourself for being you.",

He looked by turns uncomfortable, annoyed, or bored, but never inspiring. In other words, his character didn't ring true. Not to mention also unamusing. I liked Olivia Williams as Miss Cross....she at least seemed believable. But then again, why does she continue to have anything at all to do with a self-centered egomaniac like Max? Wouldn't a restraining order be appropriate? The story had a credibility problem with me, although possibly with other actors and some fine tuning this could have been a more entertaining foray into high school angst.

            "content": "When Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson put their heads together, do not expect plain old brainstorming. Expect a hurricane of theatrical proportions that drops an ocean of legendary imagery. In its aftermath you can find the pieces to a great monumental movie that only its creators could assemble so perfectly. And Anderson takes charge indeed in this modestly underrated tour deforce. Full of wit, hilarious lines, chemistry, sincerity, subliminal messages, betrayal, vengeance, and kite flying, Rushmore seems to have it all. It stands as their second prodigy-child, a brilliant masterpiece that paves the way for The Royal Tenenbaums.Rushmore is the story of Max Fischer, a nerdy, yet courageous, fifteen-year-old genius with unstoppable determination. Unfortunately his overachievement leads to an overload of extracurricular activities and bad grades that will threaten his greatest passion, attending Rushmore. With impeccable handwriting that matches his hairdo and exemplifies his demeanor, young Max is driven by a rush of testosterone to conquer a beauty twice his age, Ms. Cross. Bill Murray plays Mr. Blume, a steel tycoon that finds inspiration in Max and soon enough, falls for Ms. Cross. Consequently, the story takes a dive into an unwieldy love triangle that turns into a superfluous war and ironically ends with a play of the Vietnam War.Max's greatest virtuosity is staging elaborate high school plays which add another dimension to the film as they are presented to the viewer randomly. They intriguingly echo the movie's itinerary as much as the soundtrack does. Never has a movie's score been so exquisitely choreographed. It almost feels like a musical without the excessive corniness. Together, it all meshes perfectly to glorify the tenacity and leadership required to create something as grand as a play or a movie. That's why Rushmore could very likely be a self-portrait of its own creators. Either way, Anderson provides us with a poetic look at achievement, glory, and the power of theater.The directing and the writing seem to go hand in hand; this seems logical since Anderson does both. But there is an impervious intention to make them cohesive, like written poetry complementing the grace of a painting. His shots are composed elegantly, balanced, and sometimes symmetrical. Panoramic fisheyes introduce a setting and strong close-ups emphasize moments of beauty or climatic emotion; i.e., when Bill Murray's character falls in love with Max's girl. Another camera trick is used to emphasize Max's immaturity. The already small actor, Jason Schwartzman, is cropped in such a way that he looks tiny. Anderson makes his intentions clear when Max is conversing with Ms. Cross about their age difference making it impossible to have a relationship; this is also one of the wittiest scenes in the whole movie.Anderson's opus could not be what it is without the amazing cast. The three strung-out characters are played so vividly and with a rawness that contrasts heavily with the inflated acting of Max's plays. However, the director's eloquence pulls through and seems to illuminate every bit of the film. Every line just seems perfect. The solid acting allows the characters to permeate the audience while giving performances that stay with you for days. There are a few moments of stark deliberation to leave the audience modestly uncomfortable and a bit provoked, every cinematographer's dream, right? Being familiar with Anderson's technique does make for the dry humor and awkwardness to be a lot more digestible. But even the newbies will find the overflow of references to handjobs by the second half of the movie to be surprisingly comfortable.Again, the performances make Rushmore unforgettable. Bill Murray liked the script so much that he almost did it for free. An actor of this caliber did so much with so little playing a man of few words, relying more on gestures and a powerfully austere presence. Always drunk or smoking and very depressed, Murray adds to the character with improvisations throughout the film. Following the same natural technique is Jason Schwartzman, making it hard to believe that is not himself on the screen. The kid is only seventeen and plays his first movie with such confidence and authenticity that even at times outshines a veteran like Murray. Attention is paid to the smallest nuances: the scratching of the nose when a good repartee is required. Finally, Olivia Williams plays the love interest that keeps her cool through most of the film. She sure is a catch, excessively honest, lovable, and a bit naive. The rest of the cast is also quirky and perfect.The ending is powerful; almost tear jerking, as the curtains drop and the perfect song with the perfect lyrics seals the deal. You can but stare at the credits as a feeling of nostalgia rushes through, leaving behind a cocktail of emotions certainly worth the taste.",

Never wear a suit, especially one with a bow tie (really cool guys don't even own a suit).2. Never hang out with adults or kids.3. Do not be ambitious, imaginative, or show enthusiasm for anything.4. Make sure you use the words: man, dude, f**k, f**king, babe, drag or \"way cool\" in virtually every sentence.5. School is despised and should be avoided whenever possible.6. When you do attend classes, slump down as far as you can in your seat and nod off a lot.7. Never be punctual.8. Limit your activities to hanging out, getting high, watching TV and searching for porn.Enter Max Fischer, who is the antithesis of all of the above yet somehow is uh... \"way cool\".  The fact that this film is so popular is amazing.  Can this be the start of a new trend?  Let's face it, school IS a drag (oops!). And one rarely gets the opportunities to indulge in the kinds of extra-curricular activities like those at Rushmore.  But this film shows how vitality and imagination can be a rebellious act.  That breaking down the conventions opposed by one's own generation can be even more rebellious than opposing the conventions of your elders (one should always question authority though).  Max Fischer is a new kind of teenager.  He is his own man and he is using his imagination and wits to seek out his true path in life.  And he is respectful of others (unless you steal his girl, then WATCH OUT!).  I think Wes Anderson has tapped into the real mindset of youth.  I mean come on, it's boring being bored all the time!  It takes a lot of courage to say 'yes\" to life and to the future.  And to believe in yourself and to be responsible for building YOUR OWN future.  Call me optimistic (Max has rubbed off on me!), but I think this film has helped start to build a path to a brave new world.You go Max!",

            "content": "I never thought I'd see the day where a movie trailer could actually be better than the movie itself, but here it is!  Rushmore is only an hour and a half long, but it feels more like three and a half hours.  I'll be the first to admit that there were a few mildly entertaining things to be found in this movie, but they were all in the trailer.  If I wanted to sit for hours and hours and get only a little tidbit every now and then, I'd go fishing with no bait.  This is one heck of a long ride, and for what you get out of it, it's just not worth it.Rushmore is the story of Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), a student at Rushmore Academy.  He is involved in several activities around campus, but his grades are suffering, and so are his relationships with others.  He is on the verge of being expelled from Rushmore when Herman Blume (Bill Murray) and Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams) enter his life.  Herman is the father of two students at Rushmore and he really enjoys watching Max at work.  When Max and Herman both meet Rosemary, they both like what they see, and the race is on to win her affection.I'm at a loss for words on the acting and directing in this case.  Jason Schwartman was really quite good in this role, and we'll definitely be seeing more of him in the future.  Bill Murray was pretty good in this role as well, and Olivia Williams wasn't bad either.  The directing is pretty clear cut; there is nothing flashy or overdone.  The problem is that while the main idea behind the movie isn't a terrible one, the writing is just awful.  There are a few funny things here and there, but for the most part, this is about as boring as anything I've seen all year.  This could easily put a few people to sleep, so don't watch it when even remotely tired.  In fact, if you really want to see this, just download the trailer.  The funny parts are actually more enjoyable out of context, and you won't have to sift through the rest of the crap to get to them, the producers have already done that for you with the trailer.  The only time I would recommend watching this is if it were free.  If it's on cable or at a friend's house or something, maybe this isn't such a bad risk.  You might like it better than I did, but I pretty much hated it and think most other people will as well.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson's sophomore feature, RUSHMORE is the name of an elite prep school in Houston, and our protagonist, a 15-year-old Max Fischer (Schwartzman), is the whip-smart prodigy in Rushmore, a high-school specimen of GOOD WILL HUNTING (1997), but only if it were true, that's just a figment of his imagination in the film's jaunty opening, in reality, he is a barber's son, although, to hide his deep-down low self-confidence, Max brags about that his father is a successful surgeon. Max is granted entrance to Rushmore for his playwright talent, but he flunks in almost every major subject, while a plethora of extracurricular activities corroborates that Max is not made of scholarly material. As a matter of fact, he is on the verge of being expelled from the school by the headmaster Dr. Guggenheim (Cox), but that doesn't bother him too much, he befriends Herman Blume (Murray), the father of his objectionable twin classmates, an industrialist whose life is hemmed in a lull of disillusion. Also, reaching prepubescence lands him his first crush on the newly arrived first-grade teacher, Rosemary Cross (Williams), a widow from England, but she doesn't reciprocate her feeling due to their age difference, and, spontaneously they remain in a mutually agreed friend zone. Turning sour when Rosemary brings a date to his new school play, Max unveils his age-defying megalomaniac side which riles Rosemary and pours cold water on their budding affinity. Soon Max is as expected being expelled and enrolls into a public school, and falls out with his younger sidekick Dirk Calloway (Gamble). When he finds out Herman and Rosemary becomes an item, a puerile tit-for-tac game of sabotages kick-starts with the typical Anderson-esque moxie, sandwiched between those two man-children, one is too young and another is too old, and neither is proper to her taste, one does feel sorry for Ms. Cross. Luckily, in a well-intention-ed move, Max writes a new play paying tribute to Herman's Vietnam days, and finally, all the hatchets have been buried in the opening night of the play, Rushmore days are gone with the wind, Max finds an age- commensurate Asian girlfriend Margaret Young (Tanaka), Herman and Rosemary also reconcile. Playing out Max's defects and merits with deadpan but farcical felicity, a pint-size Schwartzman under-girds his stereotypical screen-image in his screen-debut, self-consciously loquacious and obnoxiously self-centred. Bill Murray, whose stalled career has received a critical boost since he meets Anderson and becomes a prominent figure in the latter's ever-expanding star-studded troupe, brings about what a great farceur can achieve, subtle humor saddled with immeasurable humanity, he is pitch-perfect. Olivia Williams, an incongruent English rose involuntarily gets involved with Anderson's characteristic American levity and recklessness, instils a somewhat bracing air of wholesome sensibility.The script is written by Anderson and Owen Wilson, and an indie-tinged soundtrack faithfully punctuates the narrative especially in its longueur, RUSHMORE is Anderson's arch epigraph commemorating his unconventional youth and a launch pad of his distinctively quirky aesthetic pursuit, although in a primordial but prophetic fashion.",

            "content": "I guess at first I thought this was going to be a really bad, annoying, Revenge of the Nerds rip off. In fact I was very wrong. Rushmore is a very powerful movie about a friendship torn apart over the love of one woman. It is about a boy who is far more mature than those of his own age, yet he is lacking in regards, including understanding what a relationship really means. In fact it is one of the rare Hollywood movies where the main character gives up on the girl, but that is the whole point of the movie.Rushmore is about a boy named Max Fischer, who goes to the exclusive Rushmore School. He is very intelligent, though is failing in class. What he is good at though is networking and building up a base of alliances and friendships. At one assembly he meets Mr Blume (Bill Murry) and immediately sets to work forming a relationship with him. He then discovers Miss Cross, a prep teacher, after reading a hand written note in a book. Through numerous events, Mr Blume and Miss Cross become attracted to each other.Even then the movie is not as simple as that. The main focus of the movie is Fischer's lust over Miss Cross and how he comes to terms with the fact that he can never have her. Why can he never have her? Well the reasons seem simple, but mainly that he is fifteen and she is a lot older. They actually get along very well, but she sees him as an intelligent fifteen year old who really does not understand what relationships are all about. Fischer not only must come to terms with her continual rejection, but also that his friend, Mr Blume, is also in love with her.My friend commented on how this is a really hard movie to watch. I don't think so. I guess the hard thing is that the movie says, clearly, that there are going to be women which you simply cannot have. Sometimes enough is enough and you must accept defeat. The thing with Fischer is that there was a perfectly nice girl following him around, but he was too caught up in Miss Cross that he did not realise she existed. When he finally stepped back he saw her. In a way is seems that he took second best, but I think the woman that he is dating at the end of the movie is by far the best woman for him.What about us? When do we know when to quit? Well I can't really answer that question. Sometimes we just don't know if we are chasing a Miss Cross or not. Miss Cross is a mature and intelligent woman who simply could not form a serious relationship with somebody as immature as Fischer. Indeed Fischer is immature, especially the comment he made regarding his prot\u00e9g\u00e9's mother, but the thing is that he learnt from this mistake. The big problem is that he is fifteen, a lot younger than Miss Cross, and even though relationships of that age difference do exist, Cross was not interested in it. She wanted somebody whom she felt comfortable with, and she did not feel comfortable with a boy.I think we can take things from this movie, but we shouldn't go out with a woman because we did not get our first choice. We should go out with somebody we want to. I don't know the full thing with Fischer, but it seems that the realisation was that why was he chasing a woman that could not handle a relationship with him when there was a perfectly good woman wanting one. In my case, well it is probably the same. I really don't want to let go, especially since the woman I like is quite stubborn. But there is really no clear cut answer. I guess the key is to be patient (which is not a human trait).",

            "content": "You can always tell, that you're watching a Wes Anderson's film, due to his many, now, iconic film signatures. While, the 1996 film, Bottle Rocket was his debut work; most of his well-known monikers were establish, here in his second film, Rushmore. Rushmore tells the story of a gifted precocious young student, Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), whom is incredibly bright, but scatterbrained, preferring to do extracurricular activities, instead of actual schoolwork. When, an attractive new teacher, Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams) arrives at his school, Rushmore Academy, he became so smitten with her, that he willing to do, anything to be, with her. Even, fight with his mentor/friend Herman Blume (Bill Murray), a local business, over her affection. Can Max's young heart win Rosemary's love, or will the seasoned, Herman gain the upper hand, in this romantic comedy? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, thank goodness, this love-affair movie remains lighthearted and whimsical throughout, because it really could come off, as disturbing and particularly dark, with the wrong director. After all, a comedy about two intimacy seekers, a perverted middle age man & a teenager boy hopelessly stalking after a woman, can seem a bit Erotomania in the wrong eyes and could be frown-upon, by others. Also, it's a bit hard to watch to see, two friends, nearly kill each other, over something stupid. Somehow, Wes Anderson was able to make the concept seem likable, without really changing much of the story to fit, a family-friendly mold. Often, others obsessive love-story movies for me, always seem a bit annoying & exaggerated, but Rushmore was not only, able to be, entertaining, but very well-received, kinda funny. No wonder, this quirky coming of age movie has a cult following. It's weird to think, that this was Jason Schwartzman's first film. He looks so seasoned. Bill Murray, on another hand, save his then dying-career with this film. He pretty much, owns a life-debt to Anderson. He has been in every Wes Anderson films, as of this writing, ever-since. Still, he was just alright for the most part, in this role. I love both of their off-kilter performances, here, even if it's not much of a stretch, in 'let's say, acting'. After all, Jason Schwartzman in person, is kinda an oddball, and Bill Murray, looks so wore-down by age, that it's hard to say, that he even, acting any differing. Still, I love their chemistry, together. It reminds me, so much of 1971's Harold and Maude, with their May-December friendship. Anderson has always been noted for his unique 'literary geek chic' writing style. Anderson's films are often known for its character-driven plot full of melancholic elements. Themes often centered on grief, loss of innocence, adultery, and unlikely friendships are some of his best. It shows here. I love his exclusive way of fitting in, the oddest of cultural references such as Jacques Costeau & Jacque Henri Lartique in his own unique, ingenious style. Any scene with the Max Fischer Players performing on stage is a great example of that. I also love his taste in music. Anderson frequently uses a lot of British pop music from the 1960s and 70s on the soundtracks of his films. In Rushmore, Cat Stevens and British Invasion groups are used, very well. It's doesn't drown out, the visually on the screen. Much has been written about director Wes Anderson's style in filmmaking as well. Visually, his films always stand out, due to his often bright, but also limited color palette. I love, his often retro look. Anderson has also been noted for his extensive use of obsessively symmetrical compositions, flat space camera moves, snap-zooms, and slow-motion walking shots. All-well used here. His use of hand-made artwork by his brother, Eric Chase Anderson also worth-noting. These stylistic choices give his movies a highly distinctive quality in surrealism. His films has often provoked much critical study, discussion, supercuts and mash-ups, and even parody. Rushmore is no different. However, while the movie is quirky, colorful, and highly glamorous. I, personally, don't think, its director Wes Anderson's best film. I like his later works, somewhat more. His kooky European hyper-realistic imagery style is more of my taste. It was somewhat limited here, due to the films modern U.S settling, and lack of fantasy elements. Overall: While, the movie does have some faults. Rushmore is still, an intensely intellectual film worth checking out. It's compelling visually as well, as verbally. I do recommended.",

            "content": "(spoilers) The film Rushmore had a lot to say about relationships and loyalty. It dealt both with romantic relationships as well as friendships, and the importance of honesty in those relationships. Even more than that however, the film was about the depths that people will sink to when they feel cheated out of a romantic relationship, and the massive retaliation that may come to the person who benefited from that person's broken heart. Max Fischer, who was the subject that was deprived of a coveted partner, illustrates this idea with the noteworthy quote, `War does funny things to men.'Rushmore is the story of an extremely geeky high school kid who develops an unusually strong crush on a new teacher named Rosemary Cross at Rushmore Academy, the school that he attends. He begins to go to extraordinary lengths to achieve Ms. Cross's attention and to impress her despite their significant age difference, and after a while he begins to become preoccupied with these efforts. He wants to build a huge aquarium on school campus in her honor, and one of his sponsors is a rich businessman named Herman Blume. Unfortunately, Max's infatuation is not returned to him by Ms. Cross, who feels that they are obviously not right for each other. When she begins dating Blume after having denied Max's romantic advances, Max declares war on him.When Ms. Cross and Herman began dating, he had recently had a rough break-up, and is more than likely a little lovesick about it, and possibly feels like a victim. As a result, he seems to want to project his pain onto someone else, and Max is the one that this anger falls on. It seems as though his relationship with Ms. Cross is as much a way for him to lash out at someone else as it is a romantic endeavor. One way that this is shown is when Herman was walking through a playground where a few young kids are playing basketball. One of them shoots the ball for the basket, and for no other apparent reason than just because he was there, Herman blocks the kid's shot. This crudely symbolizes his efforts to block Max's efforts towards Ms. Cross, and also displays Herman's side of the war that love has provoked between himself and Max, who until now had no problem with one another. The other side of this war is Max's retaliation from having the object of his affection taken from him by another man. This is a major turning point in the film, where it switches from containing elements of a romantic comedy to much darker situations of anger and contempt between two people fighting over the same woman. Neither Max nor Herman does anything serious at first that could alter the other person's life; Herman runs over Max's bicycle with his car, Max delivers bees into Herman's room at one point, etc. However, Max does go as far as to tell Herman's wife that he is involved with this other woman, which may have been overstepping his bounds a little bit. Being younger, Max is not as wary of the consequences of an act like this, he just wants to do anything possible to hurt the person who hurt him. This is an example of the funny things that war does to men.\nAll of the characters in Rushmore do a lot of very effective acting with their faces and body language, and there are also a lot of scenes in which there is little to no dialogue. Max is always dressed very sharply, unless he is dressed up in costume for one of his plays. Also, for a fifteen-year-old boy, Max speaks with surprising maturity. Even though he is a terrible student, he is obviously talented, and seems to feel superior to a lot of the older people around him. One good example is, of course, Herman. It seems that Max feels that he is superior to Herman and this intensifies his anger when Ms. Cross denies his amorous advances and instead dates Herman.The play that Max directed which was shown near the end of the film seems to almost summarize the entire film. The play was about a military war which Max himself had a leading role in, and it represented the war between himself and Herman Blume. At the end of the play, after countless casualties (i.e. Herman's marriage, any chance Max may ever have had with Ms. Cross, etc), Max's character is faced with a woman from the opposing army, and they are pointing rifles at each other. They make a verbal truce with each other, almost romantically. Offstage, this girl seems to be the person that Max may be starting to have feelings for, showing that he has overcome his obsession with Ms. Cross. He has found someone within his reach and looks like he has finally found a way to be happy \u0096 a good ending to a great film.",

            "content": "Schoolboy Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman)and millionaire Herman Blume (Bill Murray) are both on a collision course when they both fall in love with schoolteacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams).Normally I'd write a bit more of a plot summary for most films that I'm reviewing but I think the above summary pretty much sums up the entire story for the film. Essentially it's a very slight coming-of-age story with a slice of The Graduate thrown in for good measure.I think the biggest selling point for this film is that it's a very easy film to relate to - I'm sure there are many people who have had a crush on a teacher at some point in their lives (I suspect this applies to more people than will care to admit it). It's this aspect of the film that makes it very easy to identify with Max - all the schemes that he plans and the numerous ways that he tries to impress Ms Cross are quite amusing and daft, but are mostly believable given the fact that he's besotted with Ms Cross. This essentially is what I'd class as the good parts of the film so I'll now address some of the issues that I had with the film.....First of all there's Bill Murray's character Herman Blume; I didn't think that he was developed particularly well - the film occasionally hints on problems he's having with his two sons, but never really expands upon these problems. Also unlike Max, Herman isn't as easy to identify with. I also struggled understanding why Ms Cross would be drawn to Herman quite so easily - the film never really shows him 'wooing' her so I didn't really understand how he ended up hooking up with her. Therefore I was given no reason to care when they broke up.I was also disappointed with how little I laughed whilst watching this film; it's one of those films that contains many awkward scenes, but doesn't manage to make many of these awkward scenes funny. Therefore the film contained many awkward moments, but very few funny moments - the only scene that made me laugh was Max's drunken outbursts round the table.Nearly all the cast put in fine work; Schwartzman is excellent here and makes many of his scenes memorable. Bill Murray was also good here (even if his character is a little underwritten). The supporting cast (consisting mainly of teenagers) were all superb as well.Rushmore's 'easy to relate to' premise should have made it a winner, but to me much of it was a bit too quirky and awkward (it's almost like Anderson was so focused on these two aspects that he completely forgot about number three - HUMOUR). Rushmore deserve some praise for it being accessible to a wide audience, but for me there were way too many problems with the film and nowhere near enough laughs for me to truly be able to enjoy it.",

            "content": "Well, it's a Wes Anderson movie, and that alone is usually enough for most people to draw their own conclusions. He's a divisive filmmaker and it doesn't seem like there's much middle ground between those who love him and those who loathe him. Count me in the former camp. For what it's worth, Rushmore is probably Anderson at his most accessible. All the hallmarks are here - the cast is thoroughly quirky, the cinematography obsessively detail-focused, the soundtrack firmly planted in lyrically-appropriate 60s and 70s rock - but it's all somewhat toned down from his usual level; less in-your-face, take-it-or-leave-it.The film's subject, an insular private school and the odd, hyper-focused youths who proudly call it home, lends itself to such idiosyncrasies. Here we find all manner of brilliant young minds, developed well past their years in some respects but stunted in many others. That essential duality is interesting, amusing, understandable. They've been taught to solve for x and y, to adapt mature films for the stage (example: Serpico for kids), but remain remedial students of human interaction.Max, the focus of this personality-driven black comedy, is a perfect exhibit. At fifteen, it looks like his best days are already behind him and he struggles to compensate with a flood of strangely specific extracurriculars and, later, a sadly misguided reach for forbidden fruit: a smart, attractive, widowed first-grade teacher. He's accompanied by a colorful fabric of supporting characters. Plenty of amusingly unbalanced students, sure, but also a curious batch of equally dysfunctional adults. Bill Murray works magic with one of these roles, a tough mix of frustrated parent, self-loathing businessman, unexpected mentor and hopeful suitor. He and Jason Schwartzman (Max) share instant chemistry and the film wisely sticks them together like glue, even when their characters are at each other's throats.In all, Rushmore is a well-tuned, somewhat downplayed, dose of the Anderson style: funny, driven, melancholy and genuine. His films might not speak to everyone, but they usually hit the mark for me. This is one of the best.",

            "content": "\"Rushmore\" was the first entry in Wes Anderson's \"Searching for a Father Figure\" Trilogy (followed by \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" and \"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\"), and what a wonderful way to start. \"Rushmore\" tells the story of Max Fischer, Rushmore Academy's most extracurricular student, and it's least scholarly. Having devoted his time to joining clubs, starting clubs, and writing plays, Max has no time to study. When he befriends a lonely tycoon and meanwhile begins seducing a widowed teacher, Max's life gets only more complicated.\"Rushmore\", like Anderson's other films, exists in a world where whimsy is the norm and everything and everyone is more complicated than you might expect. Anderson's trademark style of filling every inch of the frame with details is exhibited here and, as always, it makes repeat viewings required to be able to catch everything. Also prevalent is Anderson's deliciously quirky dialogue and character development. If you love Anderson's other films, there's no way you'll be disappointed by this one.What makes \"Rushmore\" stand out from the rest of the \"Father Figure\" trilogy is the fact that the main character actually has his dad around. The Tenenbaum kids didn't see their dad for two decades after their parents split and Steve Zissou lost his father figure to the dreaded, possibly non-existent, Jaguar Shark. Max's dad is present and loving and devoted. It's the fact that Max doesn't want to be like his dad, a simple barber, that leads Max to search for a new father figure. This is what gives the film it's sad and poignant core, another trademark of Anderson's works.The casting is perfect from the lead roles down to the smallest of bit parts. Anderson sees importance in each and every character that appears in his films, and he always finds just the right person to fulfill the requirements to bring each character to life correctly. Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray (an Anderson regular), and Olivia Willams are spectacular and dazzling as Max, Mr. Blume, and Miss Cross respectively. Their nuanced and complicated performances bring all of their scenes to brilliant life. Seymour Cassel is also wonderful as Max's dad Bert, giving the film added emotional weight.So yes, \"Rushmore\" is wonderful. It's not Anderson's greatest (that would be \"The Life Aquatic\"), but it's excellent nevertheless. Alternately sad and funny, poignant, whimsical, and ultimately beautiful, \"Rushmore\" is a must-see instant classic from the most promising talent in modern cinema.",

            "content": "Far from the riotous laff fest that I had somehow expected, Wes Anderson's 1998 offering, \"Rushmore,\" turns out to be rather an idiosyncratic and quirky film...with a capital \"Q.\" In it, we meet Max Fischer, a 15-year-old at a prep school called Rushmore Academy. Max is an underachieving student who nevertheless finds time to participate in some dozen-odd extracurricular activities. His life is turned around when he falls in love with the school's pretty 1st grade teacher and competes for her affections with a millionaire industrialist in a triangle that grows progressively more nasty and uncomfortable to watch. In the three leads, Jason Schwartzman is very fine as Max (it's hard to believe that this was his film debut), as is Olivia Williams as the British love interest and Bill Murray as the increasingly besotted but always likable Herman Blume (another Blume in love!). The film itself--though its story never seems to completely gel and several scenes peter out pointlessly--consistently defies expectations; I will admit that I could never tell where the darn thing was heading next. And it has been beautifully shot, with an interesting, eclectic soundtrack to match the oddball proceedings on screen. (Like another film that prominently featured songs by Cat Stevens, 1971's \"Harold and Maude,\" \"Rushmore\" seems a likely candidate for eventual \"cult movie\" status.) Though I was initially disappointed by the picture's lack of big belly laffs, a repeat viewing proved much more satisfying for me. Perhaps it is the type of movie that requires a few watches before growing on its audience. Like Max himself, the film has lots of hidden charm beneath its whackadoodle surface....",

I thought the movie was about to give us a strange romance between them, but the romance here is only from one side and therefore not exactly what I expected.The private school where this happens is called Rushmore. Max never studies and doesn't pass any subjects but is the leader of almost every extra-curricular activity. Too bad for him he is expelled after he has done something the principal was not so happy with. Since Rushmore, and Rosemary Cross for that matter, was his life he is not very happy. Mrs. Cross doesn't love him back but she is his friend. His two other friends are the much younger Dirk (Mason Gamble) and the much older Herman Blume (Bill Murray). Unfortunately for Max we see that his friends Rosemary Cross and Herman Blume fall in love with each other.Again, from here on you think you are able to predict a lot of the story but with 'Rushmore' it simply isn't so. It is one of the great things in this movie. I was also very surprised about the performances. Schwartzman and Williams are very good and Bill Murray does an extraordinary job.

Each of the main characters is likable, but still multilayered. There are moments in which you despise the two male leads and (highly unconventional) romantic rivals, but you can always understand and forgive them. The characters are as quirky as the story, which is simple, yet complex. It could never go over one's head, but it still requires some patience and attention. The story is a mish-mash of humor, quirk, and (for some) surprising relatability. By the time the film is almost over, it has exploded into comic chaos, but there is still always room for heart in Wes Anderson's world.

For me Rushmore is not just a great movie, it has something that few movies possess, something few works of art possess. It has originality. Ironically, the film borrows heavily from a number of films including Good Will Hunting, The Godfather, Serpico, and Apocalypse Now (remind me if I have missed one or two) but this doesn't take away from the fact that Rushmore stands alone. I also think that whether or not someone likes the movie is a judge of character. I'm not saying that if you don't like the movie this means that you're a bad person; it just means that you probably stand on the polar opposite from me on every significant issue in life. I realize that there's a bit of hyperbole in that statement but this is what Rushmore does to people.The film is positively laugh-out-loud funny in many places and it has something that makes the humor even more special. At the very core there is a sweetness that only very few films can pull off without being saccharine or maudlin. I think that this sweetness is also evident in the soundtrack (someone gave me the CD as a gift) which has a song called Kite flying society; what could be sweeter than that? Rushmore is so completely unlike any other movie about teenagers that it can't even be put into this category. I don't know if I speak for anyone else but more than anything else the movie makes me wish that I could go back to that age and be a little more like Max Fischer, something I think the director had in mind with the closing song in the film with the chorus, \"I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger.\" I remember hearing a reporter ask a celebrity if there is anything good about growing older. Without a breath of irony or sarcasm the 50 something star answered, \"Absolutely nothing.\" I suppose this would be true if\u2014like this celebrity\u2014you have made no effort to become smarter or more interesting as a person over the course of your life.",

It gives you the sense of a smart film, it's just too bad that the brains behind it is all bark and no bite. Anderson and Wilson are great writers, when they are together they can pull some pretty neat rabbits out of hats. Rushmore gets a lot of praise which has me scratching my head. Do people really like slow, boring, and a main character that you simply want to beat the crap out of? Maybe everyone liked Bill Murray so much that they just had to rave about the film, because it's Murray who shines in this overrated piece of cinema.Jason Schwartzman plays his character very well, but his character is so dull and will make your eyes roll more then once. We are suppose to like the main character, but with Rushmore, I found my self begging for something interesting to happen. I was hoping that Max would suddenly stop being an uninteresting character, and someone that I can enjoy on the screen. Alas, this never happens. Bill Murray on the other hand, single handily saves this film from disaster. He is so wonderful in this film and this role belongs near the top as one of his best. All the characters, with the exception of MAX, are interesting. If Schwartzman's character only had one tenth of the charm that Murray pulls off, maybe I could have liked the film a bit more.The film soundtrack is quite good. It helps bring it's depressing mood up a little bit. Anderson always seems to have good music littered throughout his films and Rushmore is a good example. From Cat Stevens to The Rolling Stones, you'll probably end up liking the soundtrack more then the film.Ultimately I can't give this film a recommendation, but I can give it a 7. It may be a contradiction, but the film is well made. Everything flows well with it, the characters, the music, the directing and most of all it's script. But when you have such a talented cast and director, you'd expect to enjoy the film a lot more. Skip Rushmore and check out The Royal Tenenbaums, because it's simply immensely superior to this.",

At Rushmore academy he is the head of every club from Fencing to karate to the French Club to beekeeping to the drama club to being the editor of the school magazine. When he offers to stay for a post-graduate year and the headmaster informs him that RA doesn't offer one. So, Max offers 'Well, not yet' Max is a go-getter and when he meets Rosemary Cross, a pretty (but older) first-grade teacher (Olivia Williams) he turns his energies toward winning her heart. Our first instinct would be to feel sorry for him. Max is chunky, wears horned rimmed glasses and is slightly unattractive but it is his dogged determination that wins us over. His newest project is campaigning to have an aquarium installed in Miss Cross' classroom to win her affections.Into Max's peaceful existence drops a potential donor named Herman Blume (Bill Murray) a rich tycoon who also has an eye for Miss Cross. He is not a million miles removed from Max.Then suddenly the movie loses the nerve to just settle on being a cheerful character study and starts grinding the gears of a mechanical plot. Max starts to do vindictive and mean things and an unsettling darkness falls over the movie. I was happy with the portrait of an energetic kid with his energies in the wrong place, but late I the film he grows rather annoying.'Rushmore' was directed by Wes Anderson whose first directorial effort was the effective low-key crime comedy 'Bottle Rocket'. Here he and co-writer Owen Wilson have some good ideas and I liked the characters that it developed but this is really Jeckyll and Hyde situation. The first half sweet, the second half too dark.",

Having read other reviews, I think that some people just don't get this type of off the wall stuff, this exaggeration of character which often dwells within us but is rarely expressed due to the constraints of society and the lack of risk taking by most of us. Max is a delight, a gutsy, daring adolescent, who embraces all of life and takes risks: his grades suffer because of his extra-curricular involvement with all the school clubs and his play writing.  He falls in love so inappropriately with a teacher, he gets involved in a mean funny little war with his rival for her affections, he has this little fan who is just there, like a worshipping kid brother, he lies about his background, etc. He takes all of this so seriously and is a marvellous actor to portray this complex character so well and believably. I love these quirky little movies that take chances and move away from the blah and predictability of Hollywoodland. Bravo to all involved. 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson has a nice light touch in the comedy department. He also has a unique style. Whereas most prep school coming of age stories attempt a kind of been-there realism, what Anderson achieves here is something close to a kid's fantasy framed in realism.Jason Schwartzman stars as 15-year-old Max Fischer whose claim to fame is flunking most of his classes at Rushmore prep while being a boy genius who leads a dozen extra curricular activities including writing and directing his own plays. He's a kind of dark browed Woody Allen in the making. Bill Murray, slightly subdued and under comedic control, gives support as Herman Blume the millionaire entrepreneur who is impressed with Fischer's accomplishments and style. Olivia Williams is the grade school teacher they both adore.Well, if you are a slightly nerdish boy (or were one) this movie is going to just pop your tart. So wish-fulfilling is the story that at any moment I expected Max Fischer to hop into a phone booth and come out in leotards and cape. Even the plays Max writes embody a boy's dream of being a man: Serpico as played by teens, Platoon (or Apocalypse Now) in the high school gym. But I have to say anybody who watches this movie and doesn't feel a bit of nostalgia for childhood needs to have his bedpan changed.Max is a slacker who doesn't slack. Max is to be preferred to Blume's own idiot kids. Max can lead the boys at public or private schools. It doesn't matter. Max can almost win the girl, even though she is a dozen or so years older and six inches taller. Max can take a punch. Max has inexhaustible energy. Max is a leader and liked and respected by all but the school bully (whom he wins over and puts to work). Max probably will get into his safety school, Harvard, by scoring a perfect 2400 on his SATs. Humm, maybe that's a good idea for a sequel--oh, too late for a sequel, and anyway The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) certainly is better than any sequel.Well, how about Max grows up and becomes an astronaut, the first man on Mars? Or better yet, Max grows up and becomes--Wes Anderson! I have one MAJOR problem with this movie. What is with all the cigarettes? Wes, did you get some backing from Phillip Morris? I am so tired of cigarettes in movies where they serve no plot or character purpose, where they are planted merely to entice young people into a lifetime of addiction. Wes Anderson, now that you have found some fame and fortune, please remember: smoking cigarettes causes cancer and taking money from cigarette companies is, at the very least, Bad Form.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

            "content": "Nowadays, Wes Anderson's trademark style is well known but back in 1998 he was almost a complete stranger to movie audiences. It was \"Rushmore\" that gave most moviegoers their first glimpse of the quirky auteur's unique way with story and visuals.The movie's central character is teen Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), a student at Rushmore Academy whose focus on extracurricular activities has put his scholarship at risk. Troubled by the prospect of leaving his beloved school, he falls in love with widowed teacher Miss Cross (Olivia Williams). However, he soon faces competition for her affection from middle-aged steel magnate Herman Blume (Bill Murray).The story may seem relatively simplistic but Anderson & co-writer Owen Wilson managed to construct a screenplay that was both unique and accessible. Mixing comedy & drama, the movie has its fair share of laughs along with a surprising amount of dramatic heft.The cast is one reason for the movie's success. Jason Schwartzman shone in his first film role and Bill Murray nearly stole the show in support. Meanwhile, Olivia Williams was exquisite as the female lead. Other notable supporting players include Brian Cox, Luke Wilson & Seymour Cassel.Wes Anderson's visual panache is evident here, though the approach is a bit more subdued than in his later films. Still, the film's look is constantly appealing and interesting. Also worth noting is the stellar soundtrack which concentrates on British invasion acts of the 60's & 70's. Especially memorable are the uses of the Creation's \"Making Time\" and the Faces' \"Ooh La La\".Overall, \"Rushmore\" is a thoroughly entertaining comedy-drama whose uniqueness makes it stand out. Both well acted and well constructed, it shows a sophistication that is lacking in most comedies. Fans of Wes Anderson are sure to enjoy it while others will find it one of his most accessible films.",

Witty? Occasionally. Fresh, rather than original. In a way it's more about Rushmore and its pretensions than the manic Max. He is a victim of its ethos, a blurry copy of the British/New England expensive private school. An insecure kid from a poor background kid, desperate to prove himself, tries everything from beekeeping to backgammon, and nearly blows it. But when he is expelled and moves to nearby downmarket public school Grover Cleveland High he carries off his greatest triumph.This film is said to be semi- autobiographical.

With this movie I can accept that, and I would not accuse them of being humourless or missing the point, either.  Though it does not detract from its qualities, it simply is not a film for everybody. The humour is not necessarily intellectual or \"alternative\" or subtle, but it is not mainstream or Tom Green either.  Some people will look for a realistic high school story, or a realistic falling - in - love - with - the - wrong - person tale, which R is not.

            "content": "\"Rushmore\" directed by Wes Anderson (and co-written with his friend Owen Wilson) is a wonderfully executed tale that depicts both teen and adult angst, all the while offering clever touches that help categorize the film as a dark comedy. Named after the beloved school that Max Fischer (Schwartzman) attends, it involves a trio of characters that, without circumstantial incidents, probably would never have gotten together in the first place. Max is a student whose grades are so poor that his scholarship is in jeopardy; his academic career has been completely left behind for an enormous amount of extracurricular activities that Max both participates in and, in some cases, either founded or leads. When entrepreneur Herman Blume (Murray) comes to speak at Rushmore (his twin sons are students there) Max seeks him out and begins a dialogue, creating the beginnings of a strange but strong friendship. In Max, Herman sees someone with drive and spirit that he is lacking in his unsatisfying life, a life that is filled with wealth, but also with a philandering wife and two obnoxious sons, none of who care about him. Soon after, Max encounters a teacher from the elementary portion of Rushmore named Rosemary Cross (Williams) and he immediately falls in love with the young widow who treats Max like an equal (though with some bemusement) but seems to be cloaked in a large amount of sadness and loss. When Herman and Rosemary begin an affair, Max starts an all-out war with Herman, who retaliates, amounting in some pretty hilarious situations.For anyone who has seen another Wes Anderson film (Bottle Rocket, The Life Aquatic, The Royal Tennenbaums) the presentation of \"Rushmore\" won't be a surprise. Anderson obviously studied theater, as is evidenced by the blocking of the film, use of theater curtains that \"present\" a scene, the vivid colors, and, for the most part, a wardrobe that has so much character that they actually look like costumes. Other Anderson traits are present, such as the ever-present montage scene complete with punk music, brief underwater shots and precocious children. Max Fischer is an excellent character, richly written and portrayed wonderfully by Schwartzman, who makes his acting debut in this film, though you would never imagine that from his brilliant performance. Anderson has a knack for employing excellent actors who, despite their long respective filmographies, are able to take a role and (please forgive the expression that has now become overused by American Idol judges) make it their own in that you cannot imagine anyone else playing that part. Murray's character Herman is the epitome of this. It has been said that Murray read the script and was so taken with it that he offered to be in the movie for free; it is also one of the first times that Murray took on a role that didn't involve slapstick, simple humor or bodily noises, (though I did think he did a wonderful job as Bunny Breckenridge in \"Ed Wood\") which led to a mid-life career of real respectability and (gasp) an Oscar nomination. Murray is now one of Wes Anderson's regular actors, and though I enjoyed him in \"Tennenbaums\" I think this was a slightly better role for him.Though Wes Anderson is one of my favorite film directors, I can understand how some don't like his films. However, I think that the reasons are pretty much identical to why I, in fact, appreciate his films with a lot of regard. I've heard the terms \"quirky\" (overused in my opinion) and \"weird\" used. To an audience encapsulated in the mainstream, this is absolutely not going to appeal to them. I've also heard the term \"depressing\" used, which is correct to a certain extent. While Rushmore has its comedic elements, (though it is mostly dark comedy) the underlying messages are quite sad; a man who has a crappy family, a woman who recently lost her husband and a young man who is having his entire world yanked out from under him. Anderson likes to address the high points of his characters' lives in a quick montage, or as an aside in the beginning of the film. What he does with the rest of the film is roll up his sleeves and dig into the difficult times that follow the highs of his characters, whether it is financial, personal or spiritually success. And that is what I like most about Anderson and the film \"Rushmore\"; underneath the stylish presentation lies a plausible, effective and emotional story that, coupled with his wonderful troupe of actors is simply exquisite. 8/10",

It's a funny and serious story at the same time, which is about ambition, because throughout the film we see the protagonist wants more than he has and he desperately struggles to get to such a degree that he focuses more on his whims rather than on his obligations. Rushmore means a lot to him and he even translates it to other things, what he wants most in life, his desires, he makes small \"Rushmores\" and when someone tries to bother taking them off he does everything for revenge, as for him \"in war and love anything goes\". It is narrated in a linear fashion, structured as a comedy, but it becomes a smart comedy, even though it does not lose the seriousness laugh of what it is counting, plus it does not make the characters look as fools, but give laughter as they go through situations and how they react to them, which is always naturally. It's a film that shows the clash between the world of adults and young people, because throughout the film we see the protagonist believed he is mature enough to engage with people much older than him, no matter the age difference . It features Anderson's signature style, full of bright colors and very thoughtful plans. The performances are good and the script is written so that always surprises and the viewer has no idea where the movie is going, the story goes its own way with natural and nothing is predictable, until it reaches the end that the characters built along the film and leaves the viewer with a good taste.",

There is something thrilling about hearing music with which you are familiar, but that has somehow managed to escape the attention of the pin-heads in charge of selecting the oldies play lists. To hear these songs again, after so many years; know them, and yet have to go look them up, is a wonderful incentive to go out and purchase the sound track album.Unfortunately, the first thing that caught my attention was the character of Max Fisher himself. Calling him unlikable would be pathetic understatement. As portrayed by Jason Schwartzman - where is my fly swatter when I need it? - Max is so vile, so smugly repulsive that before 50 minutes had elapsed, I had concluded that the only way to deal with him would be by a bullet through the brain; as quickly as possible. This is NOT entertainment, particularly when you have already grasped the despicable fact that he is the \"hero\" of the piece.Bill Murray is no help. Though I feel he more than redeemed himself in Wes Anderson's subsequent - ( no pun intended ) - \"The Life Aquatic\", this is more of a harbinger of the self-satisfied catatonia he was to bring to \"Lost In Translation\". Not quite as somnambulent perhaps, but just as irritating. Sadly, he and Max deserve each other.A thoroughly unwatchable film, unless you somehow find Max \"cute\".",

            "content": "\"Rushmore\" is the kind of comedy that just isn't all that funny. It is well made, and does contain a few momentous comic fires, but never enough to recommend. Some audiences may find the material quite bleak, while others may think it is obscured. Doubtless, not many people will find it raveable.The film's protagonist is a trouble making student at the Rushmore Academy named Max Fisher, one of the greatest schools in America.  He loves where he goes to school at, more than anything. He gets poor grades, but is editor of the newspaper/yearbook, founder of the debate team, the dodgeball society, and president of the French club, German club, chess club, and may more things. In a particular, scene he states that Rushmore is his life. This un-realistic lust for schooling is necessary for developing the character's personality which latter carries the dim plot though termoil.After the Max character is fully understood, we begin to receive plot clinches of all sorts. First, Max is threatened with \"sudden death expulsion\" since he is such a bad student. Second, he ominously falls in love with a first grade teacher who also works at Rushmore. Her name is Miss Cross. Then Max begins to do very strange things, like building an aquarium in replacement of the school's baseball diamond. Not your typical student, is he.The film's antagonist is Mr. Blume, who is an old grumpy, almost full time drunk, mentor who works at Rushmore. He also loves Miss. Cross, which eventually leads to an affair involving the two. Max then becomes jealous and serious, and at times, dangerous conflicts result.The two characters battle out their envy in many ways. Cause: Max plants a bee hive in the room Mr. Blume is resting in. Effect: Mr. Blume secretly cuts Max's bicycle from a protected rack, and runs over it with his car, then kindly puts in back in it's place in the rack. Cause: Max cuts the breaks for Mr. Blume's car, causing him to involuntarily roll around the schools property. See a pattern forming here.The movie is directed by Wes Anderson, with lots of style, jest and energy. Unfortunately, a movie can not run of those things alone. The film often was side-tracked with un-necessary sup-plots and side effects.The performances were of various degrees of greatness. Newcomer Jason Schwartzman as Max Fischer debuts wonderfully with an upward movement towards success and character development. This will not be his last role. He has much potential and material to work with. Olivia Williams as Miss Cross disappointed me a great deal. Her acting job comes off as a seemingly half hearted and detached role for her.The performance by Bill Murray, as Mr. Blume, is the only character who generates any laughs whatsoever in the audience. He acts clumsy and cute, realistically drunk and without dignity. If he isn't nominated for a supporting actor Award of any kind, the academy needs to re-check their databases.\"Rushmore\" does have some nice moments in it. However, I can't recommend the film. The performances win but a battle, but the movie itself loses the war. If my predictions are correct, if you do chose to see the film, you wont walk out with a sense of enjoyment. Regarding the fact that the performance where I saw the film was a near sell out, and at the end there were precisely two people clapping, I counted.",

            "content": "I hated \"Rushmore\" the first time I saw it. After seeing the rest of Wes Anderson's films- and getting older- I watched \"Rushmore\" again and fell in love with it. No review could capture all the greatness that happens here... this is a movie you have to see to decide for yourself.How could I describe the film? There is no easy plot summary.. It's about Max Fischer, a high-school boy, but by no means is this a teen movie... in fact, it's more of a retro-active reflection on teenage years, or maybe a retro-active fantasy... Who among us doesn't wish we could go back and be involved in more school clubs and activities, that we had the presence of mind to acquaint ourselves with art and literature, that we had the courage and wisdom at that age to fight to save Latin? Max may be the embodiment of the \"stop and smell the roses\" philosophy, but he unconsciously rejects conventional wisdom and authority... in spite of his passion for his school's cultural and educational sideshows he's failing all his classes. Max's extra-curriculars aren't for his college transcript, he's doing this for himself. For his character the knowledge and experience are their own reward and not a trophy to be waved in someone's face. How do we know this? The only time Max becomes an obnoxious braggart about his accomplishments is when he's threatened by the doctor-boyfriend of the woman he loves. \"I wrote a hit play and directed it... so I'm not sweating it either!\"Beside the beautiful sentiment behind a character who is passionate about learning and strives to better himself while improving the institution for his schoolmates we get a love story, perhaps the most complex love story I can remember. Max's crush on Ms. Cross is at first dismissed as just a lonely schoolboy's puppy love, and yet the more the two interact the less absurd the relationship becomes. He may only be 15, but he may also be the only man who truly understands her and can truly love her. Or is there an element of Max assembling an alternative family, with Ms. Cross as the Mother he lost at age 7, and Mr. Blume the Father he's proud to show the world because of his wealth and stature?Max's biggest weakness is the shame he feels over his real Father, a lowly barber who will never understand the things Max is dying to understand. It's one of the sweetest, most human sequences in the film when Max finally accepts his Father and reveals him to the world... it seems like this Father-figure theme is a recurring one in Wes Anderson films: Mr. Henry in \"Bottle Rocket,\" Royal in \"The Royal Tenenbaums,\" the deceased Mr. Whitman in \"Darjeeling Limited\" and Steve & Ned's relationship in \"The Life Aquatic.\" Like in all his movies, Anderson underplays the most heartfelt, moving scenes here: there are no lingering closeups or drawn-out melodramatics... Max may be willing to end his war with Mr. Blume but he had still planned to drop a tree on him.By the time of the film's finale, Max- a master at scripting his life as if it were a play- has finally accepted his limitations of age, wealth, and ability, but still insists on transcending them all to share his greatness with the world... after all, he has no right to keep it to himself. The grand opening of his play, his magnum opus, is an excuse to unite all the characters in his life and make them see who he his: all the glory and fear, all the wisdom and naivet\u00e9, all the sorrow and joy... or maybe the play was just a stage direction in Max's bigger script, a script not even Ms. Cross could see coming until the film's glorious final moment, a moment so perfectly conceived by Max that it's not just a work of art, it's a work of a life.\"Rushmore\" is brilliant, rich, rewarding, hilarious, original, and unbelievably beautiful. Thank God for Wes Anderson.GRADE: A",

            "content": "So here I am, listening to Dick Dale and his Del-Tones, while trying to think of a way to open my review for Rushmore. I could go about the cheesy way and pretend to write a letter to director/co-writer Wes Anderson. I could go through \"it would/wouldn't win these Oscars\" routine. Or I could just list everything I didn't like about the movie. Instead, I'll just go through a basic routine of my usual reviews, while occupying the majority of the first paragraph with no substance whatsoever. Hey, that's just like Rushmore-something that leads you into thinking there's going to be some big outcome, but instead winds up with no value whatsoever.Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is a fifteen year old overachiever at preppy Rushmore High. He's started most clubs at school, does loads of extracurricular activities, yet fails in his classes. He's put on probation and falls for a first grade teacher as his school (Olivia Williams). He befriends steel magnate Herman Blume (Bill Murray) somehow, whose kids go to Rushmore. Herman also falls for the teacher, Ms. Cross. As this crazy love triangle unfolds, we realize that we can't care about any of these characters.This Max Fischer, he's an eccentric guy. With his gelled jet-black hair, his insistence on wearing his school uniform proudly, and an odd vocabulary, you'll either love him or hate him. Guess what I though of him. I found no redeeming qualities about him, and oftentimes I wanted to yell at the screen because he was acting like a dolt and such a pampered brat I could not feel anything but contempt for him. And since this character was in most of the scenes of the movie, I wasn't really happy with seeing this character that often. Murray's Blume is more deadpan, but doesn't really have many qualities. It's just a boring character. Anderson (and co-writer Owen Wilson) seem to think that Fischer and Blume would even each other out, but one's too annoying and one's too nondescript to really balance each other out. Plus, there's the random characters who pop in, like Fischer's sidekick, the Scottish bully, Margaret Yang, et cetera. Those characters make Blume seem almost interesting.Rushmore starts off strong-not really funny, but with a good quirky atmosphere and the typical 60s British rock songs Anderson likes to put in his movies. Then, about halfway through, the movies goes into this slapstick territory. It's still not funny. Potentially dangerous thing occur to these two characters with no moral retribution or consideration for the law. But since these people are rich, we're supposed to forgive them for their actions. That's probably the worst lesson any movie can give us. As the movie goes to its conclusion (the whole movie is an excruciatingly long 93 minutes), it gets into this sap that's completely unwelcome. I guess the whole reason I didn't like Rushmore is because of Fischer. He's trying to court this first grade teacher, she's not giving in, neither is he, but it's COMPLETELY obvious she's not giving in AT ALL. Yet Fischer's idealism is so over-the-top (like all of the movie) that it's impossible to care.All of this could be overlooked if the movie was funny. It wasn't. Even The Royal Tenenbaums was funnier, and I didn't think it was that funny, just a great movie. I don't really know how people can find Rushmore funny at all. Or, in that case, how they could like it. It starts off on a good note, but then descends into quirky-movie hell.My rating: 5/10Rated R for language and brief nudity.",

The real surprise of Rushmore is Bill Murray, who conveys sadness and depression so well that I was convinced he was going to commit suicide at some point during the picture. Although I loved the characters in the film, the film itself seems pointless. I know I'll probably get some flack for thinking the film makes no sense, but I can't help but wonder what is the point here. Nothing is really resolved and the film is too odd to consider it a slice of life story. I don't know.....great characters though.",

Written and directed by Wes Anderson, Rushmore also stars Jason Schwartzman and Olivia Williams. Rushmore is the coming-of-age tale of a college prep student who does not excel in academics who decides to be involved in every extracurricular activity the school offers. His whole life revolves around his school until he learns he is on academic probation. I understand that many people love Wes Anderson, and consider this film to be his darling, I didn't care for it, nor did I find it meaningful in its desperate half effort to be meaningful. Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) the self-proclaimed king of extracurricular activities at Rushmore, a private college-preparatory academy. Max's problem, however, is that despite the number of activities he is involved in, he has no people skills and hasn't mastered the art of friendship or even decency. He uses everyone around him to his benefit and therefore alienates himself at every turn. When he learns that his academic probation means that if he were to fail one more class, Max sees his life flash before his eyes. When a personal quest to discover who defaced one of Rushmore's library books, Max meets and instantly falls in love with Mrs. Calloway (Connie Nielsen) who begins an affair with Max's friend and parent of twin Rushmore students Herman Blume (Bill Murray). Broken hearted and betrayed, Max begins a quest to ruin the lives of those who hurt him, ruining his own in the process when he is expelled from Rushmore. Bill Murray has the depth of a sheet of paper in every role that I have seen of his, and it doesn't work for me. I'd much rather see him in the stands at Wrigley than in a film. Rushmore is a film that is trying to be important and artsy yet falls flat. Every unlikable character the audience meets is given only half of a backstory preventing any real connection to any of them. I'm just not at all a fan of anything Rushmore or its director Wes Anderson is trying to do in this film.",

Compared to Tenenbaums this seems to be a little more tightly woven as a story and characters which made for a a really good comedy drama.There's no question what director you are watching from the get-go again, the style of directing is distinct, theatrical and dynamic. Rushmore does stay more grounded in general, whereas his future work seems to become more and more stylized. Rushmore acquires a nice middle ground, with great elevated moments.This also goes for the characters in it. Most of them are fairly real feeling, except for the main character honestly everyone else had their place. But the quirkiness isn't missing though. If anything again this proves that Wes knows how to let characters breathe and show their layers, spoken and unspoken. Acting is fantastic as well, Schwartzman nails it. Murray is lovely here, but a performance we are familiar with. Williams is incredible. Music once again is used perfectly, there's a lot of it. And all of it works to elevate the scene.The comedy and writing is top notch. I absolutely love the humor here. It's really dry, but pretty much all of it worked for me here. There is a noticeable amount of more vulgar dialog but I guess it fits the teenage setting.Story feels much more solid and ''addicting'' to follow, which I didn't have as much in Tenenbaums, where it was much more scattered. Here it only really focuses on 3 characters and that helps it a lot. All in all really great.",

Max gives a warming speech then you have the closest thing to a high budget with an auditorium stage.... Vietnamese Battle with high end model choppers and explosives you can't hear the dialogue and finally I could not stop laughing.I don't think getting to that moment of laughter was worth what I went through.In summation the established tone and humor of Anderson without his current established filming style, it rapidly crosses from quirky dark comedy to depressing sociopathic behavior eventually forgiven by adults for some unfathomable behavior. It's the sympathy of his victims that literally saves him from attempted murder in the first degree.His ongoing attempts of winning the love of his teacher was overkill to cute funny charming to is Max Fisher that delusional or is Max Fisher chronically experiencing some form of Autism.Without that fictional cinematography filming style utilizing artwork, cloudiness, aspect ratios this film about 60% in goes from Dark Comedy with a very dark reality.The way it's filmed Max Fisher doesn't make it through a formal dinner without being thrown out at which point you wonder has Max hit bottom yet? And he hasn't because in away his crush, and immature millionaire friend seem to be enabling it actively or passively.If symmetry, Art work, animation e.g. The break cutting scene...like at the end of his latest movie which is fully old school animation in a rescue car chase. Or the stop Motion Animation randomly inserted in the Grand Budapest hotel as well as guns sounding like pop guns- things the ordinary doesn't think off but after viewing you say that makes sense. These effects change the feeling and perception of the horror of real crossfire. That element has taken over the top elements in other Anderson films that are depressing without the visual or tones of the performers. It's very clear to me that life is tragic and movies are a way of escaping that tragedy, it's clear that Wes Anderson's goal is to present me with a clever yet dark topic and entertain and post this film personally he's achieved that.The cinematography is a key ingredient missing from this film which might or may not be a reason for that line getting crossed.In addition for the sociopathic and disturbing behavior bursting out of max like a Tornado, as an audience we aren't provided with enough background on Max to understand it. Though we have an idea of his background from his father, we are never told anything in terms of his mother outside of her passing from cancer.. not in terms of time and where he is in the bereavement process to justify the sociopathic outbursts that the Murray character and the teacher character are lenient.\"I'm 55, I hate my kids this kid inappropriately crossed a line- but I deserved it based on what I was doing to my own wife. Bumble Bees in my hotel room you want to get adolescent ok, I'm going to run over your bicycle...now the escalation might be some crude vandalism or attempt at public humiliation but then jumping to cutting his break lines, that not only could have gotten Murray killed but other people...and you are 17-18 it's not funny or acceptable. And the tricks of cinematography were not utilized to make me possibly feel differently.Though Max presents signs of maturity it's not enough to make it believable that after the restaurant incident the teacher would have anything to do with him. And the appearance of maturity and charm clearly does not display intelligence.The only real constant comical farce are his ridiculous productions being praised or self hailed not sure... and I don't fail to see the paralell perhaps all those reviews drive him to that Grand Budapest, Isle of Dogs level.I will not feign intellectual elitism, and I don't judge a film based on its origin in terms of studios. This production if you're a buff you see the potential that finally comes out in \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" I'm not angry.Tarantino different levels there are two films of his that I felt may have been better but budget may have prevented that.Max Fischer is clearly highly imaginative (not necessarily leading to genius. Max clearly believes he is one; whether that's delusional, or in that \"Andersonian\" dimension he is; or simply narcissistic enough to begin a ridiculous amount of pointless societies and ignore all his studies)he is socially oblivious bordering almost on the ASD spectrum.Now without the style adapted since the Royal Tenenbaums I can only suspend reality to a certain extent. Now it's not only Max's behavior that perturbs me it's clearly pathological. The forgiving and allowing it to continue bothers me.At least Bill Murray as immature as he was knew when it was time to call the police. The teacher though after the first encounter regardless of the time frame of this movie which takes place either in 98 or anytime between 85-2000...would not continue providing a boy of 16-18 continued attention they'd have restraining orders.I bring up budget and use of animation and creating a \"Wes Anderson\" universe cannot really be successful without the symmetrical staged filming with colors, aspect ratios, chapter breaks, and animated aspects so I'm watching this film like any other non sci-fi action film and there's nothing that's done to break me out of regular reality..if that makes sense...Many of his funny films can be perceived as depressing from a detailed story synopsis. In some cases too dark or disturbing. The technique, dialogue, and deadpan tone that's typically uniform make the story impossible to appreciate in print format.Highly prevalent in the Royal Tenenbaums, and the Grand Budapest hotel, present in Moonrise Kingdom with clarity and aspect ratios, The Fantastic Mr Fox, Isle of Dogs, and though I liked 3/5 of the vignettes in \"The French Dispatch\" all of them are filmed the same way but \"even a broken clock is correct twice a day\"? So early on second film definitely overrated, but significantly more overrated than Reservoir Dogs but not as overrated as Blood Simple. And it doesn't motivate me to see his first film.",

But Rushmore tries to be a black mayhem comedy and tries to be meaningful heartfelt, etc. and thus does neither.As to the raves for Bill Murray's performance. He was okay, but it wasn't any big acting challenge. I kept feeling angry during the film, when they'd get to a part that required good writing to deal with emotions, they escaped by just blowing up something else or running it over. A big bummer, big disappointment. What a relief to see Replacement Killers, a comic-book visually groovy 3000 bullet movie that accomplished exactly what it set out to do, and whose 42 seconds of emotion are 42 seconds more than Rushmore exhibits.",

            "content": "Rushmore is a high school set comedy drama that provides laughs and also a sweet kind of strange story plus a great performance from a comedy legend. This also contains some great little characters, beautiful looking cinematography and sets that look like they were crafted for every great high school movie ever. With it's quirkiness and a style that many people may very much enjoy, I felt that it was firmly very good and here below is why I felt that way about it.The story is massively fun to say it is so short, it is so quirky and well crafted, it could be said the end gets slightly more dull but generally it very entertaining throughout. I felt the comedy was maybe not massively funny but when it is funny, it pretty much is laugh out loud and coupled with the more dramatic parts, it is very fun to watch. The middle part of the movie is very fun, you will see what I mean if you see it but it at times can be very enjoyable to see it all.The main big performance here comes from Bill Murray and his very funny but different than usual acting display. Murray seems to blend his qualities in humour with a way of acting like a slob to create a memorable character who eclipses others in the film. Jason Schwartzman is the actual main actor here and he is pretty good to say he is so young and a crazy character who is unlikeable at times, Olivia Williams is also steady as the teacher in which she plays a pivotal role within the film.Wes Anderson's quality script is one of the shining lights of this film and his vision of this high school movie is seen out so well along with the performances. I liked the directing also but another massive positive behind the cameras is well, the cameras themselves in the cinematography which is at times maybe a bit strange but mostly is beautifully shot and just simple scenes without much meaning are done really well to say this isn't a film that had to do such things.Criticisms wise it doesn't have loads but the lack of comedy I think hits it, as said it is hilarious at times but a few more strong jokes could have and would have scored it higher. I wasn't too keen on the lapsing end of the movie where you can feel it has no ending in sight, it does finally end but it may make you slightly confused and possibly even bored with it. It could be said it is too short but it just about squeezes out what it wants to get out.I think teens yes may like it but everyone can certainly love it, it has that quirky style so many cult films seem to have and I believe this can be just that. If you like Bill Murray's style of comedy then I will actually say you could not appreciate him here but he brings something new and it really shows off by the end. It actually can be pretty sweet as well at times so if you want a fun quirky and at times a sweet film, this is exactly your type of film.Overall it is Firmly a Very Good movie, not quite Great or Excellent but nevertheless very highly scored. With this you just have to sit back and enjoy the stuff going on throughout, couldn't recommend it more to most film fans and I imagine some will love this much more than I did, and I enjoyed it. One more thing to add, it can get kind of busy in the middle and not confusing but mixed up so bare with it and it will pay off for you in the end.",

The film itself is mildly entertaining with an engaging turn by Murray, a passable one from Schwartzman, and a p**s poor one from Williams. The story is a gentle whimsical one that seems to be self consciously indie in thought and execution. Wes Anderson directs competently from his own script but seems to have dreamed up a series of setpieces without bothering with any sort of cohesive plot. We are supposed to feel for Schwartzman's character but cannot empathise due to the fact that he has no label, we don't know if he's liked or disliked as he behaves more and more irrationally without motivation. The soundtrack is good and the film is enjoyable, but no more so than say \"Lawn Dogs\" that does the same job without any of the fuss. There's nothing to jerk off to either.",

Rushmore is not any different. Its not that I don't like what he does, but just an observation. In someways Wes Anderson is to sweet family dramas what Coen Brothers are to comedy thrillers. Max Ficher (Jason Schwartzman) is a very smart young student in Rushmore who is just not into studies. He is the founder and president of many interesting and some trivial clubs in Rushmore and is very interested in directing stage plays finally falls for a teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). Though she initially warns and later avoids his advances, he takes help from his co-student's father Herman Blume (Bill Murray) who is a well-to-do entrepreneur going through a rough marriage. When Herman falls for the teacher himself and Max gets expelled from Rushmore, how they both try to exact revenge on each other and try to win over Rosemary forms the rest of the story. It is a dream role for a youngster like Jason who gets to portray different shades like bully as well as the victim, smart and dumb, popular, romantic and loner. Rest of the cast gels well with their characters with little quirkiness added by the director. Soundtrack features some generic (now) stuff from the seventies which felt compatible. Nothing special to give a shout for other departments.Recommended especially for ones who like simple indies and quirky characters.",

Max is president of every available activity club at Rushmore, and if there isn't a club at Rushmore yet, Max will start one.  His grades however are bad, and he's been threatened to be expelled numerous times by his stressed principal.  Max then changes he befriends two older people, one a successful millionaire who is a alumni of Rushmore Academy  (Bill Murray), the other is the first grade teacher at Rushmore (Olivia Williams).  Max befriends the millionaire, and falls in love with the teacher, however, he doesn't realize that the millionaire and teacher are falling in love with each other. The acting in this movie is excellent, with Bill Murray standing out (he should have received a nomination for the Oscars).  And the jokes and story are also very good.  Like \"AS GOOD AS IT GETS\" the jokes are spread out, but they are very funny.  Wes Anderson does a great job directing, and it's an excellent follow-up to \"BOTTLE ROCKET.\"  I also do applaud Anderson's use of \"British Invasion\" music instead of cliched modern top 40 hit music.  It's refreshing to see a movie with music by The Who, The Kinks, Cat Stevens, and John Lennon.  Instead of your typical movie with teens and more \"modern\" music.

His dad is a barber not a brain surgeon as he usually tells people. He is a relentless organizer and hustler, who forms new clubs and writes and stages plays, as well as leading a younger classmate around like his personal orderly. Then, after reading a hand written note in a Jacques Cousteau book, written by the alluring English first grade teacher and widow Miss Croos(Olivier William), our fifteen year old eccentric falls in love with her. Then our hero meets an older rich industrialist, Herman Blume (Bill Murray), who is a big school alumni booster. He both uses and yet befriends the Bl;ume into a weird relationship, in order to get his pet project, which he hopes will woo our Miss Cross, an aquarium. But the aquarium scheme of his, which involves displacing the baseball field and trees causes the perplexed Dr Guggenheim to finally boot the trouble maker out to the cruder public school. Then the Blume hit it on with Miss Cross and that causes eruptions of jealousy and anger against the duo who betrayed him. This starts a feud which he gets the upper hand, he gets Cross to resign, Blume's wife to leave him, Then he gets dangerous by committing sabotage Blume's car, by merely sauntering into his factory and crawling underneath it then releasing bees in Blume's hotel room too. Okay, the characters and plot are totally original and interesting, no denying. Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson are a good talented movie team. The actors are all good too, Brian Cox, the Wilson Brothers, and the other young actors who played the students. But as a movie, it fails a level of basic plausibility. It also fails that as interesting as Max is, he is a sociopath that wiser and older adults enable, not stop. Even his Miss Cross older woman obsession yields to him in the end, They show the kid smoking on campus, and no one even tries to stop or reprimand him. And this is not a druggie movie, which is good, unlike say Spun, where Schwartzmen is a meth head. The kid does some plainly evil dangerous things yet they all get brushed off by the adults. His dad doesn't even try to give him a lecture, like do your homework so you can graduate from high school because you are a genius sort of thing. He just does cruel things but gets away with it. He shoots a bully in the ear with a pellet gun from a 2nd floor window, unprovoked, since they are in different schools, but gets the bully to star in his Vietnam war play at the public school.Clever, original but in the end, do you really like or care about a soulless hustler? The kid had some real issues, and the adults in his life didn't seem to care much either.",

Had I realized that they were thinking the same thing, we would have.  I found all the characters, with the exception of the father, to be totally separate from reality.  In some cases, this can be forgiven, because the characters are supposed to be young.  But in the case of Max, Herman, and Rosemary this is unconscionable.  I expect growth and learning in a character.  The characters started and ended in their own worlds.  I found their environment unbelievable, I found the characters started and ended self-absorbed, full of self-pity and childishness.  Little, if any, self-exploration is evident for any of the main characters.  Any humor in the film was lost on me.  I found that some of the absurdity of the film was mildly amusing, but I don't think it was meant to be.  The only redeeming character in the whole film was the father, played by Seymour Cassel.  He was very well-adjusted and knew his place in life.  He attempted to give Max some advice and guidance, but of course, Max would have none of it. Considering that I normally love quirky films (\"Lair of the White Worm\", \"Blue Iguana\"), I was extremely disappointed in this film.",

A wickedly funny but also touching tale of a bright fifteen year-old whose very precociousness gets him booted out of a private prep school, Rushmore benefits from a buoyant, keenly intelligent screenplay that doesn't waste a single character.  Bill Murray has been rightfully praised for his dimensional turn as the melancholy millionaire who allies himself with the young playwright, but equal credit should be given to Jason Schwartzman as Max and Olivia Williams as Miss Cross.  While Murray and Schwartzman comically spar for her affections, Williams reminds us why they would go so far, playing the still-mourning widow with a tender, heartfelt poignancy.  Also of note: the superb soundtrack, including The Kinks, The Faces, The Rolling Stones, Cat Stevens, and many other seemingly anachronistic choices that manage to fit in perfectly.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson's two post-Bottle Rocket films remind me, for someun-nameable reason, of Chamber Music. There's an intricacy totheir structure (both Rushmore and Tennenbaums are very verystructured films) and a sprightliness to their mood that remindsme of those delicate classical compositions. Regardless, let's discuss Anderson's first major breakthrough...Rushmore bored the pants off of me when I first saw it (or perhapsit was that my girlfriend tore the pants off me while I was watchingit...). I thought it was just a bit too precious - precious in the waythat Belle and Sebastian are precious (they also remind me ofChamber Music on their first few albums interestingly enough).Yes, Max Fischer was interesting and the cinematographic tonewas beautiful and Bill Murray was as amazing as he was inGhostbusters and on and on. The pieces were all in place, but thefilm failed for me. I couldn't pick any particular reason, there wassimply an overall disconnect between the film and me. However, subsequent viewings revealed a very subtle andbeautiful film. It was certainly not the comedy I had anticipated(perhaps the reason for the disconnect was thwarted expectations) but rather a splendid dramatic meditation on youth,age, friendship, and love. Quirks abound, but they simply give thedrama character. They don't make it funny, nor should they beexpected to. The second time I saw this film, I watched it on the big screen and,during the final dance, I actually cried. It was one of the mostmoving scenes in recent memory and holds up equally well today.Rushmore, then, is not the comedy some purport it to be (though ithas funny moments) but rather a deft drama on, really, humanity.It's Anderson's most mature work and his best for the time beingand I highly recommend it to anyone.",

            "content": "There it is again, how does he do it? How do Wes Anderson's stories move so much. With maybe not the more whimsical cinematography of the bunch, this story speaks truth about the life of the director. Although following common themes of coming of age tales, the execution of these themes are melancholic and subtle.Like with every Wes Anderson story, the movie decides to strictly follow the show don't tell rule in the treatment of each character's feelings as well as their motivations throughout it. Like with every movie of his, for me it's really hard to narrow down in specific points or aspects what is that the director does so that while it chooses unconventional ways of developing the characters it still completely succeeds at conveying the exact message or feeling.There's a sort of surrealism induced in the reality the characters live in as they confront very realistic situations in life yet the characterization of every person is absent of a logic realization. Despite how a 15 year old would be speaking to adults with that hubris and pretentiousness which would never be taken seriously in real-life situation, the adults decide to not only indulge it but also play along as part of the same world. By know, a feat commonly attached to Wes Anderson's work.Cynical and dark comedy at times, the movie portrays a characterization of a teenager that speaks in a poshy, well-mannered adult way which, while not working at first, grows on you as you get accostumed to Wes Anderson's imaginative take at whay could be considered his quintessential view at teenage angst, coping with the death of our beloved and finding our place in the world while we explore our most artistic self along the way.IN CONCLUSION, aside from the peculiarities and unconventionalities that characterizes Wes Anderson's filmmaking, the movie holds a heartfelt, troubled and bittersweet story of a charismatic and at times narcissistic teenager who is trying to understand his feelings and to make amends with his mistakes as he touches the lives of people that unknowingly needed it.",

Then, like a lot of other people, I greatly enjoyed Grand Budapest Hotel. So having heard Rushmore was his masterpiece, I sought this film out. It is not as good as GBH, but also not as twee or tedious as the other films I mention here. It all seems very forced and wooden, which is probably the point, or an aspect of a point I am missing. I smiled, I admired the witticisms and general sense of life as ephemeral it conjures, but most of the time I wanted to be elsewhere. If you are a Wes Anderson virgin, Rushmore seems a good place to start. Love this and you have hours of viewing pleasure ahead of you.

Anderson conducts an excellent cast and finds a superb Max Fischer in Jason Shwartzman.Excellent performances by Bill Murray, Olivia Williams, and Seymour Cassel. Also may I add, what a lovely woman found in Sara Tanaka! She was a great foil for Jason Schwartzman's character and came across so easily with innocence, it hurt me to see Max ignore her, but she remains an absolute favorite.Beautiful scenes are conducted and masterfully done.

This is the classic \"two guys in love with the same woman\" scenario that we have seen in many movies prior to this and throws in many unexpected facets.  The idea of a secondary school sophomore fighting a rich, middle-aged man for the affection of an elementary school teacher is an eye-opening premise.  Throw in a few others like a Scottish bully, a naive sidekick, and an almost elderly barber who is also a father and you have the minor masterpiece \"Rushmore\".  Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson did a magnificent job writing a razor sharp and tightly wound screenplay.  Anderson did an excellent in directing the film.  The cast of Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray among others was just awesome.  I think both Schwartzman and Murray possibly had the best performances of their careers with this movie (Murray should have been nominated for an Oscar).  The conflict between the two male leads is hilarious and almost nerve-racking.  Halfway through the film, I despised them both. By the end I was back liking both of them.  This is probably one the best pairings of male leads I have seen since L.A. Confidential. Overall, this is a minor masterpiece that has garnished a lot of praise for all those involved.  I hated it in some parts but I loved it in many respects.  Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson are masterful filmmakers and I hope they continue to do well.  This film gets a 9 out of 10.",

All the roles are beautifully inhabited by a fine cast, Bill Murray seemingly effortless as usual, Olivia Williams quietly captivating. The smaller parts tend to flit in and out of the story, but always to great effect and staying in the memory, they contribute to a sweet and highly enjoyable piece with a rip-roaring conclusion. As expected, the soundtrack is a chocolate box of unexpected but carefully chosen treats, knitted together with original music by Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh. Rushmore is a great pleasure after some initial annoyance, when parents in the audience may have the urge to react to Max's petulance, but it's nicely judged, another diamond on the already glittering path followed by fans of the Fantastic Mr. Wes.",

Max's success as a producer of plays indicates a promising future in that area alone, but he is also an organizer extraordinaire, initiating all kinds of successful extracurricular activities. But he neglects his school work, probably out of boredom, and is kicked out of school for that failure. His infatuation with a pretty teacher ten or more years older than him is nothing unusual, just ask any former teenage boy. His problem is that he becomes obsessed and obviously needs special counseling i.e. \"professional help.\" In the end his quirkiness appears to be more appreciated by all and happiness is just around the corner. (What is it about prep schools that they turn out so many maladjusted young men; did I mention that we now have one in the White House?)",

            "content": "...nothing? Though \"Rushmore\" counts as more amusing than Anderson's impenetrably dull \"Royal Tenenbaums,\" I am really missing the point of this director's existence in the film industry thus far.  I see his aesthetic drowning what could be brilliant, substantively hilarious and charming material.  It's a mystery why actors of the stature of so many in \"Rushmore\" and \"Tenenbaums\" are giving this guy the time of day. The source material calls for the film's essential quirkiness and I don't really mind Max's completely histrionic character--in fact, it's somewhat believable and, at times, totally likable and quite funny.  The inherent disjointedness of the film's narrative structure, however, makes it impossible to make any logical story arc over the mostly affable messiness in between.  A keen example of this is Max's relationship with Miss Cross, which goes from good to horrible to good to bad to who knows at the end.  In fact, she inexplicably seems a bit forlorn for Max at the end (hence the well-composed dance between the two at the end).  The love triangle created by Murray's Blume is completely lost and disjointed in the mix, even in this intentionally disjointed comedy.   The acting stands out--Schwartzman has to be commended for a fine turn as the neurotic and sometimes manic (if that even makes sense--is it possible to be \"sometimes\" manic?) Fischer, especially since it appears to be one of his first acting jobs.  As Miss Cross, Olivia Williams is worth her weight in gold and is completely believable as the understated luminescent English love interest.  Bill Murray does fine and is not miscast--but he absolutely seems misused.  His vague perambulations around the film seem reminiscent of \"Lost of Translation\" (or vice-versa). I see some genius in Anderson's style, but it is getting lost in what seems to be a misplaced endeavor to be clever.  I actually read most of the screenplay before watching \"Rushmore\" and see real brilliance there, but the story doesn't play out as well on film as on the sheet.  Give him one or two more movies and I think he will eventually make a crackerjack great movie. Oh wait, I'm contradicting myself.... Maybe he deserves to get the time of day.",

            "content": "I'm a huge fan of Bill Murray and I have to admit that the main reason I even saw this movie was because he was in it and I'd heard how good he was. I was really disappointed; this has got to be the wispiest, most spineless, least amusing character Bill Murray has ever played in his long film career. I can't understand why all the critics thought it was so great. Herman Blume is so insular and withdrawn that he allows Murray to display none of his patented hipster irony and charm. Nor is he a very credible character: supposedly some kind of industrial tycoon, he's not given any kind of strength or determination or craftiness - in short, nothing that would make us believe that he was capable of being the self-made man he's supposed to be.  No, his prime function in the movie is to serve as a kind of patsy/second banana for the kid. It's all about how he learns from MAX, how he comes to admire MAX, how he's duped and gotten the better of by MAX -- their relationship is entirely one-sided and it soon became very annoying.Partly, that's because Max himself is so annoying - geeky, rude and completely full of himself. I have to say, however, that I found Jason Schwartzman's performance in the role to be really good. He's not afraid to BE unlikable, doesn't go wearing the character's heart on his sleeve, begging for our sympathy. As such, he achieves a kind of purity to his performance that's admirable. And there *is* good stuff here: in particular, Max's dramatic productions - of \"Serpico\" and a Viet Nam play he wrote himself - are a hoot. Also, the film benefits from a sharp and playful editing style, as well as a great soundtrack (featuring, curiously enough, mostly mid-sixties pop tunes by the likes of the Who, the Kinks, the Faces and the Rolling Stones).But, ultimately, the film just cannot rise above the fact that its central story - the relationship between Max and Herman, and their separate attempts to woo an attractive teacher at Rushmore - is just not strong enough or well thought out enough to hinge a movie on. The role of the teacher, Ms. Cross, is particularly ill-conceived and underwritten; we get no sense of what it is about her that is so endearing to the male leads. With Max this isn't so much a problem, as it can be chalked up to youthful infatuation, but what exactly does Herman see in her? And, more importantly, what does she see in HIM (she does, after all, return his affections)? The point is, the filmmakers do such a poor job in sketching out the grownup characters in the first place, that we have no real way of knowing just what kind of person or what kind of traits they would be attracted to anyway.If you want to see a slightly better than average teen flick, I suppose Rushmore fits the bill, but don't expect much more than that. And Bill Murray fans should definitely save their money. If you want to see the Mur-man in a \"mature\" performance that's truly worthy of his talents, check out Groundhog Day instead (and if you already have, then watch it again! There's no way you can see this comic masterpiece too many times).",

Think of it: a nerd who flunks every subject but raises money to build a school aquarium. The filmmakers have built a clever bittersweet comedy around Schwartzman's Max Fischer, but without Schwartzman's unflagging execution of his character the film would not have worked, and for that he should have received an Oscar nomination.Much has been made of Bill Murray's work here, but really all he had to do was look jaded and morose for a couple of hours. The leading lady, Olivia Williams, looks cold and harsh in the bright overcast in which much of the movie was shot, and little about her acting would lend her character much accessibility. It is difficult to understand what Max sees in her.RUSHMORE was shot in Houston and is the first major feature I know of to focus on the older parts of the city, as opposed to the boomtown, high-tech, postmodern areas favored by others who have filmed here. By clever selection of locations, Wes Anderson succeeds in giving Houston, certainly not the most photogenic of cities, a sumptuous and comfortable look, a New England of the South, if you will. It will probably surprise most native Houstonians that their city can look so inviting.",

Every now and then when a film with an original story and script come out, the critics drool all over them, word-of-mouth causes people to see them and yet the studios insist on making films like The Avengers, Instinct and She's All That.Jason Schwartzman plays the role of Max Fischer amazingly well. It almost seems like this role was created for him. Being a genius requires that person to move down to the levels of others, which is probably why Max is involved with so many different out-of-school activities and not working hard enough at school itself. Watching Max in Serpico (one of his plays), plotting revenge against Herman Blume (Bill Murray), in a drunken rage or bantering with a Scotsman are all pure delight and are really the main substance of this film. Others balk at his stalking of the teacher twice his age, but don't realize this is the only way a naive Max knows how to reach out (it is explained that his mother died while he was young).Bill Murray's performance was pretty good, although not Oscar-worthy as so many others have said. This is only because his performance is so one-dimensional and never really stands on his own in scenes without Max. Olivia Williams has a quiet but decent performance as Max's love interest. She doesn't really have a lot of room to vary her performance which explains her one-dimensional character.I would fully recommend this film to all.7/10 stars.",

One reviewer complains that he's not interested in watching movies about \"Rich Americans\" without apparently having noticed once during the 90-minute run time of this movie that THE MAIN CHARACTER IS NOT RICH! One reviewer defies belief by writing \"As far as I'm concerned, I think he should be a brilliant student\" (how short-sighted of Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson not to have consulted with him during the writing of this screenplay) without picking up on the fact that THAT'S THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE MOVIE!! I can only hope that these two reviewers will some day WATCH the actual movie before passing judgement. Anyway, like \"Bottle Rocket\" and \"The Royal Tenenbaums\", this is a brilliant, hilarious character study. Bill Murray turns in one of the best performances of his career, and there are more hilarious lines than you can shake a stick at (\"Oh, are they?\"; \"Would you like me to get a dictionary?\", etc).But as in their other two movies, the true brilliance of this film is in Wilson and Anderson's ability to paint bizarre, eccentric characters who nonetheless act and emote like real people. For example, it's hard for most of us to sympathize with the lengths that the delusional teenaged Max goes to in order to try to win the love of a (very adult) teacher, but we can still (if we're honest with ourselves) appreciate the incredibly realistic portrayal of his teenage frustration (and inability to deal with it in any contructive manner) once he's put himself into that situation (e.g. the dinner scene with the \"Oh, are they?\" line). Most movies about self-consciously \"quirky\" characters tend to leave you with a taste of \"quirky\" in your mouth but no strong sense of character. This movie introduces you to characters who may be completely off-the-wall, but by the end of the film, you'll feel like you've known them all your life.",

No nudity or gross-out humor, not even have the obligatory prom.  The shock must have been lethal.\"Rushmore\" is a litmus test of sorts.  The secret to understanding movies, I think, is identifying with the character.  Some characters are fulfillment of our fantasies (like, for example, James Bond).  Others show us parts of ourselves, sometimes things we admire, sometimes things we wish we weren't. Max, Mr. Blume and Miss Cross, the stars of \"Rushmore,\" are unique because all of them mix fantasy and realistic elements.  Max is the energetic, razor-sharp individualist we wish we could be, but we watch him go over the line many times and suffer for it (fortunately, Max comes back).  Mr. Blume is outwardly successful (owns a steel mill, drives a BWM), but he's miserable until he meets Max and rekindles his enthusiasm for life.  Miss Cross is an intelligent woman who is given two choices: first between Max and Mr. Blume, but ultimately her choice is whether she wants a relationship again or to stay faithful to her dead husband.Some people just don't get \"Rushmore\" -- it's a difficult movie to latch onto, and not always easy to like.

I liked Bottle Rocket plenty, but was aware that Wes Anderson was a divisive director and that Rushmore would represent a very possible peak for his style. I was also aware that if I liked this movie, or, gasp, loved it, I would never escape the cloud of hipster-ism that would surely pop out of nowhere and provide woeful narration for the duration of my life. And yet... I loved it. Yup, I'm pretty sure that I loved Rushmore.Now, I'm pretty sure I didn't like Max Fischer much at all. I mean, he's a little endearing, but also remarkably sinister, and oddly dark for a comedy. But then, Rushmore isn't like most comedies. I've been working on a rather far-fetched theory that the most enduring comedies all stem from an inner darkness, or depression (see Louie, Burn After Reading, etc.), and Rushmore certainly works that angle. Although Max and Herman's antics create a lot of comedy, they're rooted in an obsession (or is it devotion?) for love--Rosemary. She calls them children, I'll call them innocent--Herman obviously identifies with Max for his idealism and his spark, his imagination and his wit, and above all he identifies with Max's courage. Herman's cannonball is laugh-inducing, but also some form of suicide, some form of drowning. He's feeling a little lonely, and he wants to escape. Max's attempts to impress Rosemary are less depressed, but they reveal a manic and willful distortion of expectations and human interaction--he's a deeply disturbed little person, redeemed by a wild imagination and a frightening ability to love. Think of his obsessions before Rosemary: Rushmore, and his plays. And think of his explanation for going to Rushmore: \"my mother saw my play and thought I should go to Rushmore.\" That must be grief, right? Max's infatuation with Rosemary is a deeply uncomfortable plot device for a movie like this to carry on with, but it works because it all contributes to catharsis. Like the part in the play where the train zooms by, many significant moments in the movie are drenched in sound and represent a release--Anderson loves his songs, but they're also background noise to disguise the intensity of the movie, rather than to simply amplify it. Max's love of Rosemary also sets into motion him finally getting over his mother's death, and accepting his father's identity--Rosemary is similarly afflicted with a devotion to a dead person. And when Max identifies \"a dead fingernail\", he's come to terms with something inside him as well. One of my favorite interactions in the movie is when Margaret Yang interrupts him, and she reveals that she fudged her experiment results: \"It didn't work. I thought it would, but it didn't, so I faked the results.\" Or something of that nature. In the end, Rushmore is about fakery, and about spectacle, and about how real life doesn't operate that way. But it's also about embracing that honesty (even in fakery) and allowing it to guide a person to maturity and acceptance. For a movie often derided as all style, Rushmore carries so much substance it kinda hurts.",

I guess I can see that Bill Murray's fans, going into it and expecting _What About Bob?_, might be scratching their heads.  Where are the laughs?  Bill Murray should be commended for his courage in appearing in something so off-beat and challenging._Rushmore_ isn't a side-splitting, laugh-a-minute comedy, but it is, indeed, a very funny film.  It also has moments of great awkwardness and deep pain--not the sort of thing you generally go to a comedy for.  Maybe it wasn't marketed properly?I like the postings that compare this to _Harold and Maude_ and other, similar genre-busters.  _Rushmore_ does, indeed, have the sort of buzz about it that could guarantee it has a long-lasting cult success.  That it won't reach a wider audience is a real shame, since this is one of the most original American films of the past 10 years.If Hollywood would give us films like this more frequently, maybe there wouldn't be so many people scratching their heads when confronted with something different.  This film, almost effortlessly, captures the sort of real emotion that crap like _Patch Adams_ can only dream about.",

One of the best things about the film is the performance by Jason Schwartzmann because it is an exceptional performance for an exceptional character.

The acting, directing, dialogue, cinematography: all genius! Whoever chose the songs for the soundtrack was no slouch, either.The film tells the story of Max (played by Jason Schwartzman),an underachieving sophomore at a prestigious boys' day school who has an uncanny ability to win friends and influence people. His dozens of extracurricular activities (Rushmore Beekeeping Society, for example) and prodigious playwrighting talents keep him from his studies;he brings home 30s and 40s on tests.Max falls in love with a new teacher at the school, and chaos ensues. He ends up romantic rival to a worn-out millionaire philanthropist(played by Bill Murray). They vandalize each others' property and just basically act like children for the love of the pretty young teacher. Max eventually gets kicked out of Rushmore and the plot really thickens.This movie is dense: plot strings and relationships go every which way, but the movie manages to never go off track.The movie seems to be about many things, but here are some ideas that went through my head as I watched: 1) The ability of relationships to destroy or better lives. 2) The child and childishness in everyone and the difference between them. 3) Peoples' need for friendship and the loneliness that is somehow always in everyone.Maybe I'm crazy, but someone should get some kind of award for this film. I love only a few films, and this is one of them.Fun things to watch for: Budweiser boxers, everybody smoking, throwing star psycho, slow-mo drama, a nine-year-old in charge of dynamite, and a line from the movie Heat.

In reality, in a school as tony and upscale as Rushmore, someone on the faculty would have noticed Max's antisocial behavior patterns years ago and would have him eating Ritalin like they were M&Ms.The praise and kudos heaped on this movie (I keep reading the adjectives \"genius\" and \"masterpiece\") is reminiscent of the fawning by the pseudo intellectual crowd over the painting consisting of a lone, single dot in the center of framed white canvas.  Brilliant! Yes!Yeah right, whatever.  I'm tellin ya, the emperor ain't got no clothes!Rushmore is not funny.  Original and quirky do not = good.  The characters are not sympathetic nor do their actions bear any semblance to normal behavior nor is their behavior far enough over the top to make this a parody.

He has tremendous spirit. His true talent lies in writing, for he is an accomplished playwright who directs and produces them starring his very own \"Max Fischer Players\" and is the Founder and or President of every club on campus. But his grades are horrible. He is put on academic probation. Things get thick when Max is inspired by a depressed millionare, Herman Blume (Bill Murray). Also, he falls in love with 1st grade teacher Ms. Cross (Olivia Williams). Max shows his true lack of social skills when he feverishly attempts at courting her, only to be in compitition with Blume. The movie is bascically a Love Triangle between a bright student who thinks he can get anything he wants, a married businessman, and a pretty school teacher. The movie is lots of fun and is an ode to loners everywhere who want to find love.

            "content": "The word 'auteur' is French for 'author', essential the idea behind auteur theory is that a filmmaker exercises an authorship over his/her work as if they were a novelist. This results in their work always consisting of a stylistic, technical or narrative signature that is unique to them, allowing the audience when watching a film to instantly be able know who directed it. Since the dawn of cinema, we have had the pleasure of witnessing many auteur's doing what they do best, which is making films that are unique and inherently them; may it be Hitchcock and his ever present big twists or Tarantino and his hyper violent nonlinear narratives. But in this modern day, only one filmmaker working do I really feel optimisers the word auteur the best, which is Wes Anderson and if you read my Moonlight Kingdom review you will know I'm a massive fan. Forget Moonlight Kingdom or Royal Tenenbaums, because Rushmore in particular ranks as my all time favourite Anderson film. Every school has them, that one kid who seems to have at least 40 hours a day, while the rest of us mere mortals only have 24 to wrestle with. Then not just seemingly having more hours than the rest of us, this one kid is also able to achieve and do so much more in a week then most people do in a life time. Rushmore has one and his name is Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), an obnoxious, precocious 15 year old who is just about involved in every extracurricular clubs known to man; it could be as dull as competitive box packing club, as pointless as a hopping backwards whilst blindfolded club or even as impossible as a synchronised diving whilst playing the violin club. If there is a club, I can guarantee that not only is Max Fischer the president of that club, but was probably the found of it to. But you're thinking with all that extracurricular activity, how would he have time to do well academically also? Well even the extraordinary Max Fischer can't be a part of all those clubs and still get straight A's, his failing and is in the danger of being kicked of Rushmore, which promises to make a lot of people happy, including the head teacher himself, the school bully and his once pint sized friend now turned bitter enemy . Then when you thought that was harsh on him, to top it all off, he has to compete for the affection of the beautiful yet quaint teacher Rosemary (Olivia Williams), with his much older, idol and best friend Herman Blume (Bill Murray), who also just happens to be a millionaire too. Sounds like trying to sink the Titanic with an ice cube or trying to accurately measure how tall Mount Everest is with a 6 inch ruler; basically what I'm trying to say is things seem pretty impossible for Max to able to both win the girl and stay at Rushmore too. But this is Max Fischer we're talking about! He can't even spell the word failure \u2013 no literally he can't, he flunked English too. Being only Anderson's second feature after Bottle Rocket, you can forgive Rushmore hasn't quite got the same Picasso-esk cinematography, that with its rich, vibrant and bright textures is so effortlessly able to set each scene a blaze with colour, that is beautifully demonstrated in his later films like Moonrise or The Grand Budapest Hotel. However Rushmore still possesses Andersons flair for creating seemingly perfect and coherent characters on the surface, but when you actually venture under the glossy finishes, you realise they are more mad, crazy and dysfunctional then you could ever imagine. And it's for that very reason why I loved the characters of Herman and Max so adamantly, who while on the surface seem so dissimilar; Max being so pronounced and well put together while Herman on other hand is always a car crash waiting to happen, but deep down they are just lonely souls seeking the honest feeling of love and acceptance. My favourite sequence of theirs was when they were trying to sabotage each other; Max by putting bees in Herman's hotel room and then Herman in retaliation destroying Max's bike. The sequence was so imaginative and provided a shed load of many great laughs, reminding me greatly of Tom and Jerry. What I also love about Wes Anderson, is that he never gets lazy when it comes to characterising his supporting characters, they are always so dynamic, unique and if we were to follow their lives instead, it will also make for a great movie. When it comes to picking the best supporting characters, it's so difficult because they all have such compelling personalities and idiosyncrasies, there is Max's father who is a barber but is always strangely mistaken for a neurosurgeon, there is the bully with the really thick Scottish accent and then there is Dirk who is so adorable that he puts Macaulay Culkin in Home alone to shame. Empire was right when it ranked Rushmore in the top 200 films of all time, because I'm in no doubt that Wes Anderson's banger should be on everyone's bucket lists of films to watch.",

Byreading the reviews here on IMDB or anywhere for that matter,people either love this film and think it's a true classic or hate itand can't seem to figure out what the fuss is all about it. I love itand think it's an absolutely fine film. This film has a brilliant scriptby the genuis Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson team and thedirecting by Anderson is, quite simply, amazing. Combiningeverything from French new wave to sophisticated (Read:pretentious) art film. The story follows Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), a very smartstudent who takes up most of his time writing plays instead ofstudying and listening in class. One day, he hears a speech fromHerman Blume (Bill Murray, in his best performance since'Caddyshack') and becomes obsessed with this Blume person,someone very similar to himself. Herman Blume is a very wealthyman but obviously realized that money doesn't buy happiness. Histwo kids, Ronny (Ronnie McCawley) and Donny (Keith McCawley)hate him and his Wife (Kim Terry) hardly talks to him anymore.Through a series of events, Max eventually finds himself in lovewith a teacher Mrs. Cross (Olivia Williams). Soon, Herman Blumefalls in love with her too and Max and Blume finds themselves in afriendly rivarly between each other.What I love from this film is the way it seems so... messedaround. There is a plot but it seems to go in completely differentdirection and from the outside, looks, well, just like these bunch ofrelated topics. Letters, Hand Jobs, Plays and Barbers all seem tobe messed around and some parts, like the hand job parts, arelike a totally unrelated topic that relates to the plot. It's very hard tosay in writing and would be easier if I was talking directly to you.Letters also play a big part and that leads me to another thing Iwanted to mention. When Blume walks up to Miss Cross whenshe and the class are outside painting and gives her the letterfrom Max. We cut away to a close up of \"Dear Miss Cross\" on theletter and we hear Max's voice reading it. We then cut back to MissCross and Blume as Max continues reading. It's these little things,like the editing, that make this brilliant. It's also a sort of art filmtechnique that they used.The acting adds a lot to this film. Jason Schwartzman and BillMurray absolutely shine in their roles as friendly rivals Max Fischerand Herman Blume. Olivia Williams is very convincing in the role ofRosemary Cross, the teacher that Max and Herman are fightingover. Brian Cox, Seymour Cassel, Stephen McCole, Mason Gableand and Luke Wilson all steal the scenes they are in as theco-stars of this film. Well, you either love this film or hate it. Either way, go to it with anopen mind and you'll find out what you think of it soon after...",

            "review_title": "A little disappointing but not bad",
            "content": "Rushmore left me a little disappointed.  I was expecting a sort of screwball comedy from the trailers.  Instead, it teeters on the edge of melodrama and only touches on truly comic moments.  Those moments are little treasures, but for the most part this is a somewhat depressing movie about a kid who falls into infatuation with a woman far too old and completely wrong for him. Jason Schwartzman, who plays the hero, Max Fischer, is able to make Max into a completely original character.  He is the kind you guy you might remember from high school who was fanatically involved in extracurricular activities at a great expense to his academic life.  Max is such a person. He is a student at Rushmore Academy, a prestigious prep school on the outskirts of his small town.  He is there not because of his rich parentage but his grade school performance, on a scholarship.  His dad is a barber, although he tells them he's a brain surgeon. In between flunking his various courses, he is busily founding the Rushmore Beekeeper's Association, the Remote Control Airplane Pilot's Club, the Living Arts Group, the fencing team...you get the idea.  His pride and joy are the Max Fischer Players, a drama club that puts on his own interpretation of \"Scorpio\" that inspires a fistfight in the wings.  He takes his extracurricular activities very, very seriously. He is, in short, in love with being at Rushmore.  But soon after we are introduced to him, he finds something else to love: Ms. Cross, the first grade teacher.  She has just started at the Academy, and he wanders into her class by accident, falling head over heels.  They talk, he learns that she loves Latin, and he switches his adamant opposition to Latin courses at Rushmore to presenting a signed petition to keep teaching it.  Soon, he is tearing down trees on the soccer field to make room for the new aquarium she dreams of. Ms. Cross is no fool.  She picks up immediately on Max's infatuation with her, suggesting gently that she is too old for him.  He disagrees silently. It is not about age with him; such considerations are irrelevant to teenage love.  \"She's my Rushmore,\" he says, and that sums it up for him; there is no higher praise in his mind. Complications:  Ms. Cross has begun seeing Herman Blume, the local steel tycoon whose own marriage is on the rocks.  Blume is rich but filled with self-loathing.  The interesting thing is that while he and Max become rivals, they start as friends, and their friendship is maintained in a odd, standoffish way even at the height of their emnity.  Blume is impressed with Max's heart and determination even before Ms. Cross enters the picture. Afterward he is forced to respect his deviousness, so that even as Max is releasing bees into Blume's luxury suite at a hotel or Blume is backing over Max's bike with his car, they have a grudging respect for each other. The problem with the movie is that the situation it creates is ripe with opportunities for comedy, but it frequently ignores them, instead focusing on the pain of Max's crush.  I don't argue that it should overlook this factor, but place it in the context of the humor, however dark.  It is clear that comic moments are carefully inserted, and I enjoyed them.  But there is room for a lot more, and I felt like filler material was used instead.  The film meanders from one scene to the next.  There are parts that dragged as Max slowly comes to realize the foolishness of his position, but I was less moved by these than by his relationship with Blume and the way they played off each other's personalities. It's too bad, really, since the movie has a lot of potential to be something more.  Bill Murray is an actor I have missed seeing over the years, and his few appearances since \"Ghostbusters\" have mostly been flops. I enjoyed his portrayal of Herman Blume, the quiet way he suggests deeply rooted insecurities in a powerful man.  Schwartzman conveys real pain amidst the absurdity of his situation, and Olivia Williams is effective as the exasperated Ms. Cross.  All in all, I liked the characters, the plot and the acting.

A sparkling little comedy that has few rivals, done in an engrossing style reminiscent of 60's suburban satires.Priceless moments abound as the 15-year-old super-precocious under-achiever Max Fischer (exquisitely played by Jason Schwartzman) matches wits--and childishness--with the jaded industrialist Herman Blume (Bill Murray) for the love of a brainy peaches-and-cream schoolteacher.  A fine premise, but what good any premise without dialogue and talent of calibre to save it from floundering in the shallows?  \"Rushmore\" goes deep and stays deep; all of its characters retain humanity and credibility even in extremis, and no one degrades into caricature. There is a gloomy stretch (no \"Animal House\" this), but only because Max *must* get his well-deserved lumps, at the same moment that we lose sight of Bill Murray--but that is soon gratifyingly rectified, a testament to Murray's deadpan genius.There are many memorable lines.  One of Blume's, seeming to refer to the sturm and drang of one of Max's plays, but we know better: \"I just hope it ends happy.\"  It does, indeed.",

Maybe it was the not clean enough editing, or the extra amount of time an actor poses an angry face after a joke, Wes Anderson's style hasn't hit that sweet spot for me - the thing that makes you moan \"Wow this is great cinema\" or laugh out loud; they only give me a slight chuckle with a tint of awkwardness afterwards.Rushmore is the second I watch after Moonrise Kingdom, and it fell along in the category. The movie comes with funny, then ponderous melancholia, but it felt that there was a lot of things happening in a scene, craving to strike your attention, that none of them actually make a good, big impact enough for a lasting impression. The protagonist, Max Fischer, is an insufferable and unpaired young person, that we can feel his pain of trying hard to put on his bravado, while figuring out things beyond Rushmore. However, I never found myself sliding with him. Max's obsession with the elementary teacher, Ms. Cross (whose role Olivia Williams with extremely attractive and phenomenal in) is undying and repetitive, it seems that after times and times of being heartbroken and rejected, he still finds new ways to get her, using each and every wild trick left in the book. I love Bill Murray's character: he is a friendly, loving and worried mentor, but also a nuanced, and lonesome character who also struggles to fit in and find his place like Max.Rushmore is funny, ridiculous and good, yet I cannot take it more than a children's movie because it is a continuous and hinged series of adventure with light-hearted and downcast moments, and lacking character progression. Still, Wes Anderson's quirks are undeniably great, and his touch of melancholy and incisive theme refine a charming foothold for the movie.",

The first scene is a fantasy sequence in which our protagonist, Max Fischer, dreams of being able to effortlessly solve the most difficult math problem in existence. He casually heads to the chalkboard, coffee cup in hand, and with perfect calligraphic handwriting, quickly jots down the lengthy answer\u0085he's correct and everyone in the class cheers. Fast forward to a scene not too long after, and we learn that Max is actually \"one of the worst students\" at Rushmore Academy. For while Max is, hands down, the most enthusiastic student at the school, he has difficulty making time for any actual studying. Max is involved in enough extra-curricular activities for a half-dozen students. If he's not directing and performing in one of his over-the-top productions from the seemingly far-from-amateur \"Max Fischer Players\" (\"you'll find a pair of safety glasses and ear some ear plugs underneath your seat...feel free to use them\"), then he's acting as Russia in the Model U.N., managing the school's La Crosse team, or beekeeping.Then one day, Max's attentions are turned to love whole when he falls for a teacher at his school, and doesn't seem to mind or notice that she's about 15 years too old for him. That's because for Max, nothing appears out of reach. (He plans to apply to Oxford and La Sorbonne, but Harvard is his \"safety school.\") He is unflappable and determined no matter what happens in his life (even when he is eventually expelled from his beloved Rushmore Academy and is forced to go to public school). Max's love interest isn't sure how to handle the situation because at first she finds his interest charming, but then his infatuation becomes, as with everything else in his life, completely over the top. Max simply doesn't understand why she's not attracted to him (\"Max, you're 15 years old\u0085attraction doesn't enter into it...\"), and just thinks he needs to try harder to win her.There's not a whole lot of plot to \"Rushmore,\" but even if there hadn't been, I think I would have enjoyed just watching the characters interact and do their thing. Jason Schwartzman (and Wes Anderson) have created in Max Fischer one of the more entertaining and original movie characters I've seen in years.But perhaps the best part about this movie is the rockin soundtrack. It simply draws you in. (If you don't already own all of these songs separately, buy the soundtrack.) Anyone who is a fan of Wes Anderson's work must necessarily appreciate his wonderful taste in music, and his talent for matching the perfect song for the moment on screen. Anderson creates what I like to call \"musical vignettes\" that one feels compelled to rewind, watch and repeat (well, I always feel compelled). I get the feeling that Anderson personally loves each one of these songs to the point where he can direct a film around them.",

The movie has a great deal of warmth and wit, and though some of the story seems a little unfeasible and certain plot developments are just kind of 'glossed over', the performances are great, and the whole movie feels heartfelt.

Jason Schwartzman (as Max Fischer) caps a breakthrough performance as the young playwright who will do anything to impress Rosemary Cross (the beautiful Olivia Williams, whose beauty exudes from that of Rushmore Academy). Both actors do so well in their roles, you can't picture anyone else playing these principal actors.But the movie belongs to Bill Murray, who plays steel tycoon Herman Blume, whose admiration of Max (and vice versa) begin the film. I saw \"Rushmore\" when it premiered in early 1999 but decided to comment on it once I saw the film again, which I did tonight. It is a LOVELY FILM. But I saw it for Bill Murray, whose great acting and comic timing make the film more enjoyable than it already is. Whether smoking two cigarettes at the same time or blocking a shot from a young basketball player while simultaneously chatting with Max on a cell phone, Murray is funny in every scene he's in. Best scene: Herman, fatherly gut and all, cannonballs into his swimming pool during his twin sons' birthday party, with everyone watching. Barely remembers to toss away his cigarette. A wonderful little snippet of a great little film.Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson previously brought us the little-seen 1996 gem \"Bottle Rocket,\" which starred Wilson as a young wannabe thief named Dignan who thinks being on the lam from the law \"ain't no trip to Cleveland.\" Max Fischer and Dignan are alike in many ways, especially in that both are young men full of pipe dreams. Dignan has a fifty-year plan, involving several heists, that may gain him respect, especially from master thief Mr. Henry (James Caan); Max's plan to join or found as many extracurricular clubs as possible may gain him popularity (and perhaps a love in Miss Cross). This is Anderson's second major collaboration with Wilson; let's hope we see more from the both of them.There are some no-nos in this film, however. Margaret Yang (Sara Tanaka) and Magnus Buchan (Stephen McCole) seem cliched and at times tacked-on; Margaret, though sweet, adds really nothing to the \"girlfriend\" role. One plus for this character, though: we discover she's just as inept as Max, doctoring results on a science project when she doesn't get the results she wants. Magnus Buchan is the typical Scottish tough guy; no real reason for this character to be around except to be bullish. Both actors do pretty good jobs, though. Mason Gamble, as Dirk Calloway, Max's young apprentice, also does a good job for a role that calls for stalking Herman and following Max around.Fine acting, beautiful photography, and a pretty darn good story equal a great little film. Wes Anderson is a great director and will be better known around the movie house once he finds a really big breakthrough film (hopefully without resorting to Hollywood exploitation). His vision of young love is realistic and most likely drawn from a past experience, or in the least an experience he would've experienced had he lived it differently.Rent \"Bottle Rocket\" for another great film and buy the \"Rushmore\" soundtrack. Both of Anderson's films contain great music, especially those involving guitar strumming. This film even contains my favorite song of all-time; I won't tell you what it is, but rent or buy this film and listen to the song that begins soon after Max's first trip to Herman Blume's factory (when Max asks Herman for a favor). When Max emerges from a random building in Rushmore Academy, and the color of the leaves are changing, and leaves are picked up by the breeze and disappear, I feel Wes Anderson captured the mood perfectly for a song that always makes me smile.",

Well, the brilliance lies in the dead-seriousness of Max and how straight he is played by Schwartzeman and all the actors for that matter. Bottle Rocket, another film by Anderson and Owen, also uses this technique where the characters are almost ridiculously serious.

The film Mr. Fantastic Fox was a very unique movie, however it wasn't one of my favorites.

            "content": "WARNING: CONTAINS POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS.Let me tell you what I thought of Rushmore: Brilliant.This film skirts the romantic commedy genre without entering into it (Thank God...) Instead, it's more of an offbeat comic melodrama that is more of a character study than a typical three-act movie.   But make no mistake: this does, as Max Fischer would require it, follow the three-act movie formula.\nACT 1:  We are introduced to Max and his cohorts who attend Rushmore academy - a private school somewhere in the U.S. of A.   We quickly come to the realization that Max is not your typical snob-nosed rich kid, instead he about the most non-conformist conformist that one would ever likely to meet. He's obsessed with his school, obsessed with writing plays (usually based on films....) and obsessed with a first grade teacher far too old and too different to make any sort of meaningful romance.   But that doesn't stop our hero Max....ACT 2:  Max, unable to win the affections of the lovely grade school teacher, goes slightly insane.   Meanwhile, his buddy Mr. Bloom (Bill Murray), without really trying, does win the teacher's heart - as well as body.ACT 3:  You guessed it, somehow the writer finds reconciliation for everyone - though I won't spoil it by going into the details.   However, I thought the ending of this movie one of the cleverest since \"A Boy and His Dog\" - a cult film which has one of the best endings ever.As I sat watching this film unfold before me, I could not help but to think of \"Harold and Maude\" and \"The Graduate.\"   As other reviewers have mentioned before me, it seems that Rushmore, in it's own offbeat way, pays tribute to both of these wonderful films of the past.\nI'll admit it: the reason I rented this one was because Bill Murray is in it.  Bill can put on quite a show when given the opportunity, and he does not disappoint in this film!  I fell in love with his Mr. Bloom character, and would gladly watch this one several more times just to see Mr. Murray's performance.   Also, I agree with all those reviewers that have mentioned that this is his best performance since Ground Hog Day.But the character of Max is truly the glue that holds this film together. Jason Schwartzman does one of the most brilliant, subtle performances I've seen from a non-Brit.  His characterization, even in the midst of Max's own self-destruction, is a wonderful surprise.Max is my kind of guy.  You hate his guts, but can't help but feel a bit of pity and compassion for his plight.   You want to take him by his preppy school uniform jacket lapels and just shake some sense into his little holier-than-thou head.   But one need not to, for Max is more than capable of doing it to himself, with a bit of help from his Scotch archenemies Magnus.But I must heap the most praise on the director,  Wes Anderson, who obviously has the guts to take a film off the beaten path and have some fun with it.   There's a whole slew of people who won't care for this film, but I appreciated every little odd touch the director gave this work.  There's a level of craftsmanship here that one rarely encounters in films anymore. And it is obvious that director deeply cares for his characters and their plight - something that is the mark of the truly great Hollywood filmmakers.The beauty of \"Rushmore\" is that there's a whole lot more to this film than the actors and the script.   The director actually has the GAUL to ask the audience to think and feel about that which they are watching, not just react to it.    This is the kind of film a wine loving, Shakespeare reading, cultural commando - dyed-in-the-wool film buff just loves to dive into. And this is what sets this film so far apart from the usual crap that comes from Warner Bros. and Universal...By the way, I'd watch this movie again just to listen to the soundtrack. It is a wonderful compliment to the film.   Whoever put it together deserves great praise as well.For those of you tired of the same old Hollywood refuse, \"Rushmore\" is a breath of life, and easily one of the top ten films of '98.    ( And the Criterion people must think so too,  because there is a Criterion DVD edition of \"Rushmore\" coming soon...I'm going straight to Amazon.com to reserve my copy... )",

He is a natural leader, and easily makes friends with adults twice his age. The adults around him recognize his situation, and give him a lot of leeway to adjust. Trouble begins to brew when he develops strong feelings for a teacher, and his friend Herman (Bill Murray) gets involved in it too. The performances of the three main characters are superb. The characters appear real and engaging. The story remains simple, but interesting. Max is a smart kid, and he uses his talents to get what he wants. Bill Murray's acting is laudable, because not once did it feel unreal to have a forty-something man acting as a messenger for a fifteen year old boy. Herman understands him, and he allows Max time to hate and love him. It is a comedy, yes, but it is the complete package.You tend to empathize with the lonely yet gifted childhood, laugh at the deadpan humour of Bill Murray, and hope for a happy ending.",

            "content": "When I rented this movie, I was already a fan of Wes Anderson and his film \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" which played in movie theaters not too long ago. [ 2 or 3 years, maybe... ] I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but I imagined it would be great because it was made by the same person who did \"The royal..\". I was right. This is not a bright and colorful movie. It's extremely subtle, and the characters have many sides to their personalities. I think this great subtlety is what makes the charm of this movie, but this aspect might repulse many viewers who expect something different. Is this a drama or a comedy? I certainly did smile and laugh several times, but like I said, it was very subtle. It's a movie that's completely filled with emotions, but these feelings aren't overpowering like in some other movies.\n*** Small spoilers ahead ***Another great thing is the unexpected events in this movie. There was clearly no \"moral\". This movie tells the tale of a teenage boy who falls in love with a beautiful teacher and at the same time becomes the friend of the school principal who also loves this teacher. We already think we can predict what is going to happen. It's the same thing with everything the boy achieves. He is very obsessive about everything, and that leads us to think he's going to learn a lesson and change the way he thinks and acts, but that's not what happens at all! I was very pleased by this aspect.The characters is what really makes this movie one of my favorites. Usually, teenagers in movies are based on stereotypes. Max wasn't this way. When the movie started, I expected him to be a geekish student who was good at everything, but that's not what he was at all. He's a genius and participates in all the student activities at his school, yet he doesn't have time to invest in anything else. He's obsessive and doesn't have one bit of common sense, yet he is respected by his classmates because of what he does at the school. Blume is played by Bill Murray who is one of my favorite actors. He's bored with life and old, yet very immature. There's a strange contrast between this character and Max. Max is the smart guy who has all the ideas and no power because of his young age and social status, and Blume is older and rich but definitely not as smart as Max. Even though they aren't portraits of the typical American teenager and older man, they are genuine characters.The fact that friendships between adults and teenagers are possible in this movie is something I liked a lot. It's very unusual. Most of the relationships in this movie are.This isn't a movie I would recommend to anyone. Most people these days want realism, but at the same time they want everything to be glamorized. This movie is the complete opposite of that. While not trying to be realistic, it has a very \"real\" side to it. We believe in the story, it's not far-fetched, yet it has a touch of fantasy.",

Max Fischer is one of the most fascinating characters in a long time.  I've gotten tired of everyman type actors.  Is it just me or is Tom Hanks overrated?  The actor is boring.  Schwartzman, who plays Max, has a very promising career ahead of him.  His portrayal of a nerd that is very sure of himself, a welcome breath of fresh air, is dead on.  Even though Max would behave like a spoiled brat at times I couldn't help but cheer him on.  He's only 15 in the movie for goodness sake.The shots in this movie are actually pretty gorgeous for a comedy.  The numerous close-ups are very effective in conveying about a hundred times more than the words do.  This is especially so in showing the quality of Ms. Cross that Max and Herman find irresistable.  The lines reveal much as well. With just a few words, Herman shows how much he loathes his spoiled brat kids.One theme this movie presented that I found interesting was emphasis on grades.  Max flunks out of Rushmore but you know that he has the drive to become a success, regardless of pointless rote memorization.  Another was that you can learn to live in the real world but not give up goals, no matter how high they are.  Such as the way Max resolves his pathetic attempts to win Ms. Cross' love.\nBy the way, this movie has one of the cheesiest but funniest lines ever:Max:  Nice nurses' outfit you got thereMs. Cross' boyfriend:  They're OR scrubsMax:  O R they?",

One might expect Bill Murray to provide the comedy, but it is Jason Schwartzman who steals the show.

His warped views on how to relate to people make him the perfect match for Bill Murray's character, a wealthy and lonely businessman.  Their friendship turned rivalry reveals just how fragile both characters are, and shows how dependent even those who seem to have everything under control can be for other's attention and affection.Wes Anderson has done a fine job with this film; a film that is endearing and memorable, especially with its use of a catchy soundtrack.

And yet this can also be seen as a comliment to the way in which Salinger finds his way into the mind of an adolescent creeping up to and looking over the brink of independence and adulthood.Rushmore is just like this. Max Fischer is a frustrating character, high on delusions of grandeur, desperate to be seen as a leader, determined not to be seen as a scholarship tryhard. Up until now every adult he knows has seemed willing to accept him at what he thinks is face value. But he's not who he thinks he is, and he sure as hell isn't an adult yet, even though he believes himself to be.This movie is quirky, poignant, warm and the performances are understated (especially Jason Schwartzmann, whose naive self-confidence as Max is so finely tuned.) At times it's excruciating to watch, in much the same embarrassing way that \"The Office\" (BBC TV) is excruciating to watch. But that discomfort is what makes films like this so irresistible: in Max Fischer we see a great deal of ourselves, and we cringe, and we totally understand.",

Bill Murray is so hilarious in this (and in this director's other movies too) he deserves an Oscar for at least one of these roles and I think this one might be the best.

It's great!\" No way to describe the plot that doesn't sound either boring, lame, or disturbing; perhaps a mixture of all three. So perhaps we should abandon all attempts to explain Rushmore by plot, and instead focus on the character of Max Fischer, the heart and soul of this newly-birthed Andersonverse.Max is the proverbial C-student who is destined one day to rule the world. That's because he's intelligent, charming, and leadership material in a way that rarely translates into good grades; that rare visionary who's also a do-er. Max spends so much time writing school plays, learning about offbeat extracurricular interests such as kite flying and beekeeping, and fieldmarshalling grand schemes to build an aquarium on the baseball field, that he rarely considers the basics of readin' writin' and 'rythmatic to be a worthy use of his time. Everybody at Rushmore adores Max -- except of course for the grade-fixated Dean, who tells (Bill Murray's character) Herman Blume that Max is \"the worst student\" in the entire school.Max's only real obstacle to his manic passions is his own youth. He is foiled in life and in the pursuit of love by the fact that despite all of his many gifts and devotees, he is still a kid muddling through the pitfalls of adolescence and immaturity. He wants desperately to be noticed by the lovely young teacher Miss Cross, but is foiled time and again by shyness, fear of rejection, and bad judgment calls. Despite all of this, Max still manages to rally ingenious solutions to the problems he has created for himself and others.A strong case could be made that Max Fischer is Wes Anderson's alter ego. Basically, you will love this film if the character of Max resonates with you -- and if not, you probably won't like many Wes Anderson films as a rule. All of Rushmore's plotting, acting, directing, and pacing is infused with Anderson's whimsical and nontraditional style--very similar to Max's style. I have often wondered if Rushmore wasn't written with some strong autobiographical leanings in mind.Overall, I found Rushmore to be a sort of timeless, understated comedy which I enjoyed several years later as much as upon the first viewing. Rushmore has a lot of heart. Don't expect gross-out humor or crassness, because this is the gentle Andersonverse after all. If that brand of comedy appeals to you, then you're in. Welcome!",

Dr. Guggenheim is the burly steward of Rushmore's status of excellence. Dirk is a young boy with no apparent siblings, peers or father figure, in need of a mentor. And at the center is Max Fischer, son of a aging widower and modest barber.What makes this movie so beautiful is that there really is no villain. Everyone is drawn together by the visionary, quixotic thunderbolt that is Max. And eventually they are drawn apart by his equally impractical romantic pursuit of the attractive teacher Mrs. Cross.Despite the conflict this causes there is a constant backdrop of care and impossible grace between all the characters. Almost like they are too tired to pretend they don't love life more for having met each other. And conversations that would never happen in reality, or cost too much in pain, all happen. All truths are spoken. All faults are admitted. All apologies are made. And yet it doesn't wrap up in a perfectly neat bow. These are still people who carry pain, and deadness, and sorrow. They end up in a happy balance where they haven't destroyed Max's vitality too much, nor his creativity, just popped his delusion.It's also a laugh out loud movie, if you find this kind of subtle, absurd, almost surreal humour to your taste (which I do). Little things like Bill Murray's Blume talking to Mrs. Cross to reconcile on Max's behalf, and then running off like a little child to go tell him. Or the after-party for Max's last play which he treats like a New York city opening, complete with the Vietnam barraks set plastered with nude playboy centerfolds. When in actuality the audience is full of kids from 6 years old and up, their parents and teachers.A great ensemble cast, not enough can be said for the music's nostalgia and sentimentality. People continually use the word 'quirky' and 'odd' as if it is the primary feature of this movie. It is not. Just like quirky and odd people need that mask to reveal their humanity in bits, that's what this movie does. Uses the quirky and eccentric as a device to draw you near.

This is one of the best movies I've seen this year. Bill Murray is a revelation.  He didn't get the Oscar nomination everyone was predicting, but never mind--he's understated and brilliant.  I'm beginning to prefer him in these supporting roles (see \"Ed Wood\" and \"Wild Things\") as opposed to his starring flops, like \"The Man who Knew Too Little.\"  Jason Schwarztman turns in the second best child performance of the year (after Kieran Culkin in \"The Mighty\").  His character is not the most sympathetic one--he's 15, brighter than most kids despite his failing grades, and more ambitious than any teen character I've seen on screen.  I think there are too many people over-analyzing this movie--sure, Max does some illegal things here and there, but to dwell on those consequences would take away from the focus of the movie, which is learning to break away from an unhealthy relationship.  Max and Bill Murray's character both love the teacher, but neither can really get close to her (Murray does, at least physically, mainly due to his age and coincidence).  The love triangle that occurs is one of the most original ones I've seen - and all three characters become stronger in the end (although Murray's is a little more ambiguous). Now I'm over-analyzing this movie.  I think it's a great, offbeat comedy, not for all tastes, but on a plain with a good Jim Jaramusch or Hal Hartley film.  And a big improvement over \"Bottle Rocket,\" in my opinion.",

            "content": "Rushmore is a movie about Max Fischer(Jason Schwartzman): a young man who is enrolled in the prestigious prep-school bearing the movie's title.  He is far more ambitious than most.  His problem is that he spreads himself too thin.  He is the founder or president of half a dozen clubs and involved in many others as well.  He is in so many clubs and organizations, in fact, that his grades are horrible.  He's obviously smart enough to get better grades.  When the school's headmaster tells him he's about to be expelled if he fails one more test, Max thinks of ways to get around it, without ever even considering buckling down and studying. \nThe story gets interesting when he becomes friends with a rich Rushmore alumnus named Herman(Bill Murray).  Shortly after, Max falls for a teacher at Rushmore, Ms. Cross(Olivia Williams).  From here, Max and Herman's friendship is thoroughly tested when Herman realizes he is also in love with the timorous Rosemary Cross, despite being a married man with two children. The movie certainly has its funny moments.  I especially liked Murray's speech in an early scene.  He urges the students that aren't already rich to \"take dead aim on the rich ones.\"  I also enjoyed hearing all of Max's embellishments.  He tells people his father, a barber, is a brain surgeon.When the movie gets too serious is when it looses its way a bit.   Max becomes sinister in his actions against Herman during their dispute over Ms. Cross.  A scene involving Max and Ms. Cross also is quite staid and seems like it belongs in a different film. \nFinally, director Wes Anderson gives us a trite ending that detracts from the overall tone of the movie.  I guess I did want everything to work out for Max, but things get hunkydory to the point of silliness.  Anderson's film is mostly offbeat and should have stayed that way for the duration.",

It has excellent performances from Jason Schwartzmann, Mason Gamble and the always underrated Bill Murray. It is also beautifully shot, in contrast to so many indie films where the director seems to think that shoddy production values and little attention to visuals automatically confers some kind of Gen X credibility. I'm just glad I saw it, as it's the kind of film that usually passes me by due to my own laziness.The only other thing I want to say about it is that it contained more eyebrow than any other film I've seen. Between Schwartzmann, Olivia Williams and Seymour Cassel, I was very nearly overwhelmed by sheer weight of eyebrow. I'm surprised there wasn't a part in it for Noel Gallagher.",

How far can a career sink?With Murray, I think he has more of a career left, but it wasn't displayed in Rushmore.  I just don't see praise coming from this performance like he should have received as Larry Darrow in \"the Razor's Edge\" a movie with a great story and great characters.Rushmore's characters were interesting, there psyche's all screwed up from the travels of life, but seeing a young boy at 15 in this scenario is just a little too unbelievable.  As was the funding for some of these school plays that seemed to be the more enjoyable part of the movie.  A public school play with helicopters and dynamite? What was next, DeNiro and Pacino making small cameos in these creative high school productions? Maybe even a little special effects from Digital Domain?Max's chacter had to be some what influenced by Woody Allen, but not to detract from the performances, all held their own amicablly.It would be hard to watch this movie again, But it would be much better seeing some of Murray's other brilliant and hilarious performances that seem to be almost ad lib.

The young actor who plays the lead is mesmerizing. All of the supporting cast is solid, including Olivia Williams who really shines here (unlike what she was asked to do in Costner's The Postman), but the most amazing and wonderful performer in the movie is Bill Murray.  It is the most subtle characterization he has ever done on screen and it is absolutely flawless. Every pause, every facial expression, every line he delivers is golden.

The story is clear and to the point -- A high school student is in love with a first grade teacher.  He does many outrageous things to try to get her attention, and throws little fits when she doesn't pay any attention to him. He has his friend, a business man in his forties help out, and he falls in love with the teacher as well.  Pandemonium takes place.  The story may seem just a tad bit insane, but the way that the actors play it out will leave you in stitches.It's really hard to make up my mind on whether it's pure genius or not -- the acting is great, the jokes are great, the whole movie itself it great, but it leaves you with this feeling of confusion...  But even if I can't decide if it's one of the best movies on earth, it's still one of the best movies of the decade and worth a much higher User Rating than 200.Check it out if you're a fan of strange and not-so-obvious comedies.  Even if you aren't a fan of Bill Murray, which many people that I know aren't, you should still enjoy it.

Rushmore is one of the best films of 1998 and is one of the best films I've ever seen, and one of the funniest. Rushmore re-teams the team who brought us the cult hit \"Bottle Rocket\" Rushmore focuses on Max Fischer, a student at the elite Rushmore private school. Max is the founder, president of literally all the after school clubs and extra curricular activities. He's president of the Backgammon club, edits the school yearbook and newspaper, and even has his own team of actors \"The Max Fischer Players\". But what this highly involved student doesn't have is good grades. He soon befriends a local millionnaire, who is played by Bill Murrary, in which he does a brilliant job portraying Mr. Blume. He deserves an Oscar nod. He also befriends and begins a crush on to the first grade teacher at Rushmore, Miss Cross. And so begins of the most funniest and entertaining movie love triangles. Rushmore is very well done, it's funny, it has a deep good script, you don't know which way it's going to turn. This is a great follow up to \"Bottle Rocket\". I simply love this movie and was very fortunate to see in its one week release. Don't worry the rest of you, Rushmore opens nationwide in February. I can't wait to see it again. A masterpiece.",

He is more interested in fitting in through extra-curricular activities, than getting good grades.  His grades begin falling considerably though, and he is threatened to be expelled if he doesn't bring them up.  In the meantime, he falls in love with a kindergarten teacher named Mrs. Cross.Mrs. Cross is open to Max's friendship, but not to his love.  Max resents this deeply.  He tries every measure possible to win her hand, including building an aquarium.  Mrs. Cross is not ready for any kind of relationship anyway, because she is still clinging to the memory of her dead husband.Mr. Blume is the third person.  He is a wealthy man who owns a steel company.  His marriage is gone, and he pretty much despises his two kids, and the feeling is mutual.  He is a very delicate man whose sanity is questioned more than once.  He sees Mrs. Cross through Max, and soon falls in love with her also.Max doesn't like this.  The war begins.  Both men try different dastardly deeds to win Mrs. Cross.  Comic mania ensues.Rushmore is the best movie I have seen so far this year.  The entire cast turns in great performances, especially Bill Murray.  The movie is very unusual in terms of structure.  It is divided into acts, like a play.  The 60's-70's music in the background goes well with the movie in a way that's hard to explain.  In conclusion, if there is one movie that you see this year, make it Rushmore.",

Even if it were not a clever, observant comedy with excellent performances anda sly, understated visual style, I would like it for being about something different. That it is all of the things mentioned only compels me to praise it further. On the basis of this film, Wes Anderson is in the front ranks of American directors, Jason Schwartzman is a star in need of a follow-up role, and Bill Murray has finally grown up enough to be considered a major actor. The details and nuances in this film convince me that writers Anderson and Owen Wilson are acquainted with a real-life Max Fischer of some sort, or perhaps were him themselves. This notion puts a smile on my face, because I know some Max Fischers too. And I love them, and so does this movie, which is a comedy about a kid who is almost talented enough to forget he's an underdog. His slow self-discovery and the monumental effect it has on others drives this beautiful film, which is sometimes hysterically funny and sometimes painfully somber, and never less than totally compelling.",

His choice in music is impeccable. Never have bands like The Faces, The Rolling Stones, Cat Stevens, and The Kinks been used more effectivly in a movie. The critical buzz on this movie may have turned some people off, and that is a shame, because after all is said and done \"Rushmore\" holds up better than many of the other 'critical choices' from the 90's ( i.e. American Beauty, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon ). It's basically a charming, quirky, little movie without an agenda. Bill Murrey is perfect in understated role as Max Fisher's teacher- turned- nemesis turned friend, and Jason Shwatzman could be the next Dustin Hoffman.

There is no way he could have stayed in that elite school for even a day acting the way he did unless his parents donated three buildings.

The plot is porous with logical gaps. There are many more absurdities in the film, too numerous to mention.

Indeed, despite his reputation for a rather arrogant temper, it's a testament to Anderson's abilities as a filmmaker that some of the movie's most fascinating moments occur during moments of no dialog.

However, after watching it a second (and third and forth...) time, it's one of my favorite movies.Now granted, there are some very funny moments in \"Rushmore,\" but they're not of the \"guy gets hit in nuts and bowls over in pain\" ilk. Some of the jokes are a little more subtle, but just as hilarious if your into that sort of comedy - i.e. \"Sure Central America and whatnot. But moving on.\" The plays that Max puts on, the music and the witty dialogue is what makes this movie great for me.

It shows he was perfect in the role. Bill Murray is back baby!! His performance is flawless as depressed millionaire Herman Blume. Director Wes Anderson has finally given Murray a role that was suited for him. He is totally at ease throughout this film. The script written by Anderson and partner Owen Wilson is definitely originally priceless. The plot is thought out with no glitches or bad scenes, just one funny part after another. Better than \"Bottle Rocket\", \"Rushmore\" has a certain way of presenting itself without it turning into one of those stupid Jennifer Aniston comedies or movies such as \"Half Baked\". The total 60's soundtrack is awesome, with music from \"The Who\" and other great old bands. Anderson and Wilson have a great knack for writing scripts that are funny, but have sort of a serious undertone that makes the movie so great. Olivia Williams also deserves raves for her performance as the terrorized teacher who just wants to be left alone. Another great performance is from Mason Gamble, otherwise known as \"Dennis The Menace\" from the '93 movie. Gamble is quite funny as Schwartzman's little friend Dirk Calloway, who helps do everything he does. Supporters, English actor Brian Cox and screen veteran Seymour Cassel, also bring imaginative acting to the picture. But this movie is really Bill Murray's movie. Anderson and Wilson have given him a chance to make a comeback in the business. Let's hope we don't see another \"Larger Than Life\"!",

It's one thing to have a crush on your first grade teacher when you're actually in the first grade, but in this case Max just seems like a whacko stalker.The film makers try to make us believe that Max is some sort of gifted genius by running us through a massive but brief montage of his activities, but when we actually see the guy in action, it's impossible to believe he has the brains for any one of those activities.  He supposed be directing plays and editing the newspaper, but his social skills are so lacking, he'd never be able to carry it off.In Harold and Maude and The Graduate we get the May-December element combined with the social satire in much more effective way.  Of course Ben and Harold are, unlike Max, rich kids so the outsider element is missing. Unlike Max though Ben and Harold know how ridiculous their parents' world is.  They're insiders who have become outsiders.  Even the more recent Loser (which while enjoyable isn't in a class with The Graduate and H&M), gives us an outsider who for all his geekiness comes to understand what's going on around him, and throughout the film we see his sincerity.

The main character does things for no particular reason, i.e. things don't occur in any particular sequence, nor does one action seem to lead to another. And the movie never bothers to explain why he does the stuff that he does do, it seems totally random.The \"romance\" or even the plays the main character put on are never fleshed out. There are numerous random scenes that have nothing to do with what came before or after, they could have been cut out and no one would have noticed - in fact 80% of the story could have been cut out without anyone noticing. You could have also taken the film, cut it into scenes and put it back together in a random order and no one would notice.In other words there is no story, only a collection of (well acted) scenes.

This film is like a strange dream you have where you can't figure out what the hell you were doing in that place talking to that person and what the heck was your Grandma doing there. But the dream still made you laugh at how odd it was. That's what it felt like. We follow Jason Schwartzman around as he full fills his quest for love with the tantalizing Olivia Williams. Bill Murray also has a great role in here as a sort of philanthropist going no where man who strangely effects the film in a low key way. The funny parts in this movie usually won't hit you until a few moments afterwards and they might not hit you at all. This is a hit or miss movie. To borrow a line from crazy Dennis Hopper in 'Apocalypse Now' you either love it or hate it. I can't see someone reaching a middle ground here. When I describe it as non linear I mean that it doesn't follow some standard young kid falls for an older women crap. It goes off on funny tangents. The supporting schoolmates really add life to the film. They help support Max Fisher's love for new extracurricular activities (in which there are many). The soundtrack also adds astounding detail and sets the mood in each scene to perfection. At one time I felt like this movie was Dead Poets Society gone mad (mainly just because of the private school thing). My favorite parts were the elaborate school plays Mr. Fisher puts on, especially 'Heaven and Hell'. I was laughing my butt off at the little kid playing a soldier. Rent this movie if you feel like your in a lighthearted mood and don't need comedy rammed down your throat. One last note, you might not catch it but if you look at my user name you'll see why I got it right away, there is a funny little spoof on the movie 'Heat'. I almost fell out of my chair.

If you've seen the trailer (which I found very enjoyable, by the way) then you've seen the best bits of this movie.  The lead character is a horrible whining scumbag who deserves to be hit a lot more than he actually is. Comedies with whining arrogant leading men are not necessarily bad: \"Annie Hall\" features Woody Allen being incredibly annoying at times (for example, in his dismissal of Annie's taste in poetry) but in the end, guess what? He doesn't get the girl, it doesn't all work out for him, and, in other words, it's not like it is in the movies.  And yet the film works: it has charm, believable characters, wit and depth.  \"Rushmore\" fails because it has, essentially, nothing.  The lead character does not progress one iota from beginning to end.  At the start of the film he's putting on an ambitious play - \"Serpico\" - which everyone loves.   At the end, he's putting on another one.  Big deal.  He dreams of being the class mathematical genius, and, at one point, we even see him being taught by the love of his life, but so what?  He gets Latin reinstated at school just to impress the teacher he loves, but so what?  And what the hell is Brian Cox doing at the end of the play, turning up with a big smile on his face?  Last time we saw him, he quite rightly hated the little git.  And what about Max's father?  Max is so ashamed of his dad's profession (barber) that he tells everyone he's a surgeon.  This is never addressed, and the father doesn't seem particularly bothered. Max turns up at the teacher's house one night, pretending to be injured, and then behaves despicably and is thrown out (quite rightly) but hey, he forgives her at the end.  HE forgives HER!  The guy should have been shot years ago, but no, because he's \"quirky\" and a \"nerd\" he is automatically loveable.  Please. Oh, and the girl who loves him and will put up with him treating her despicably too, is an equally ludicrous character. That said, all the performances are very good and the film looks great. But it is badly written, ill-thought-out, unbelievable, unamusing and often incredibly sexist and objectionable.

While I wasn't as smart as some and I didn't start liking Wes Anderson with his most successful film, I came to appreciate it more as time went on. Now, \"Rushmore\" has come from being a film I loved to a film I will cherish. It is now one of my favorites. Maybe it's because this time around, I caught a lot of things. I found the story to be a bit more touching than it already was; and I discovered just how much I want to be like Max Fischer. The kid carries himself like a gentlemen yet he's a dud when it comes to academics. Maybe I am somewhat like him already; just not quite as fascinating (or likable). \"Rushmore\" is a truly rare piece of cinema because for the first time in a while, everything in it seems to come together to make this massive dramedy that ranks amongst the best I've seen. Maybe it IS the best I've seen. Or maybe it's too soon to tell. None the less, \"Rushmore\" will forevermore be known as one of my favorite films of all time. Maybe it's not the most historical; and maybe it's not the most well-known, but this cult favorite is a hell of a time. Not only is it funny and touching but it's also artistic as far as complex style goes. The cinematography is flawless, the soundtrack is awesome, and the characters are endearing and layered with the kind of ominous complexity that makes you want to uncover their secrets (or problems, if you prefer). I've also come to realize that all of Wes Anderson's films end with a realization. The character(s) learn to value something through the ordeals of the film, and I guess it's safe to say that their troubles will pay off. \"Rushmore\" is almost the kind of delightful feast that makes you want a sequel, but then again it's too great of a film for a second coming. I think any further continuation of Max Fischer's story would ruin the thing all-together. Besides, I like how the film ends. This is the best film of 1998 and one of the best films of the 1990's all-together. If I had a top five list of my favorite films, then \"Rushmore\" would fit the bill. That's how much I love the most well-known of all Wes Anderson's wondrous creations. With \"Rushmore\", I think he has improved a lot over the flaws of his previous \"Bottle Rocket\". While I enjoyed that little film, it's nowhere near as awesome as \"Rushmore\". And I don't care if it doesn't suit everyone's fancy; I just love this movie so darn much. I'd say it's worth it for everyone to give it a chance; whether they agree with the style or not.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/721884/reviews/?search=rushmore",

            "content": "Wes Anderson's second film is an oddly original coming-of-age story about an eccentric teenager named Max (Jason Schwartzman) who ambitiously participates in almost every extra-curricular activity at Rushmore Private School. However, all of these clubs cause his grades to suffer and threaten his existence at the school. His life begins to change upon meeting two people: a rich businessman (Bill Murray) and a beautiful school teacher (Olivia Williams). Max befriends the former and develops an obsessive crush on the latter.Rushmore is a very funny and refreshing inventive new spin on the coming-of-age genre. Max's world and the people that populate it are quite original -- esp. Max who is a creative, albeit misguided genius who is able to adapt the Al Pacino film, Serpico into a high school play. Jason Schwartzman does an incredible job of transforming Max into something more than a goofy caricature. His performance runs the whole spectrum of emotions -- an incredible achievement for his debut film role. He even holds his own against a veteran like Bill Murray, whose appearance in this film is a surprising revelation. Murray never mugs for the camera but instead creates a very subtle, nuanced performance that is hilarious and also quite tragic at times.Rushmore is truly a unique film that is a quantum leap from Anderson's debut film, Bottle Rocket (1996). With a killer soundtrack of obscure '60s British Invasion rock 'n' roll music, Rushmore is an entertaining look at a fascinating world and the characters that inhabit it. It's touching without being too sappy and funny without being too obvious.Brilliant stuff.",

            "content": "The concept behind Rushmore is novel and the characters are well cast. The protagonist is a socially-awkward, lovable, pathological liar who falls in love with a private school teacher who's a bit too old for him.Rushmore is subtly hilarious. Much of the film's humor derives from Fischer's character flaws and the awkwardness of the situations in which he puts himself. Viewers accustomed to overt humor probably won't crack a smile, but more attentive viewers will crack a few good laughs.The soundtrack suits the naive nature of the protagonist and the film itself. By no means is it amazing, but it definitely works.The plot seems to meander a lot. The movie often feels more like a collection of marginally connected moments in Max Fischer's life than a coherent story.For most movies, a loose plot is a huge shortfall. But Rushmore is just too darn heartwarming and novel for this to matter much. In fact, I would argue that Rushmore actually benefits from it. Despite how the film meanders, Rushmore is still easy to follow, and the lack of direction seems to contribute to its charming naivety. I was never confused over what was happening; I was only ever puzzled as to where the film was going.Rushmore is a quirky, naive, and rather unimportant film. With this in mind, it's easy to see why people who take themselves too seriously would hate Wes Anderson's woefully neglected gem.",

The movie is hilarious without any slapstick comedy or toilet humor.  The acting is top-notch, and plot absolutely wonderful in a surprisingly whimsical and touching way.  You are sure to walk away with a smile on your face.Writers Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson should be better known.  Wilson is a familiar face in cinema, often playing a memorable skirt-chasing eccentric who gets killed off half way through the movie.  Luke and Andrew, the other members of the Wilson clan get some screen time in \"Rushmore,\" and are sure to be recognized, as well.  The Baldwins?  The Wayans?  Nah, it's the Wilsons for me.Stars Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, and Olivia Williams are perfectly cast.  Quirky yet strangely familiar, it's easy to relate to the characters and root for their happiness.  Keep an eye out for Schwartzman and Williams in upcoming films, they have bright futures ahead.  Murray is as great as ever, with a more subtle performance than we usually see, and gets a chance to show a much larger range of comedy.If you haven't seen \"Rushmore\", hurry to the video store and pick up a copy.",

Saving Private Ryan has a great deal of impact, and is a finely made film, but in retrospect it is admittedly a little schmaltzy.  I cannot say the same for Rushmore.  Quite possibly one of the best movies to be offered up from the decade of shameless cinematic self indulgence.  It is honest, quick witted, charming, moving and humorous.  Our hero seems to be some kind of sociopath.  About 2/3 of the way through the movie, you start yelling at the screen wondering why he is driving everybody away from him when they seem to care about him so much.  Despite his yearnings for the older woman and his manipulation of several near him, I found the most crushing relationship was between the boy and his father.  He just kind of brushes the old man aside.  Very little attention is paid at all.   But there is a lot of charm in this picture.  Bill Murray gives probably one of the best performances of his career blending his deadpan comic brilliance with sympathetic humanity.  Despite the fact that he is obviously a total prick, we feel for him and hope everything comes out well.  The soundtrack is also impeccable, and performances on all counts are radiant.

All of a sudden I began hearing this very weird dialog. 'We like the same things - soup, snow peas, talking - and not talking.' I thought to myself 'what is this - some kind of weird porn movie?' And I continued ignoring it for a while longer until I heard the voices of Levy and Begley Jr. It was then I remembered what the girlfriend had said.I looked the movie up at the IMDb quickly and was surprised to see who was behind it: Bill Murray and company and the man with the extra loud guitar amplifier. I knew then I was lucky to still be awake to witness this one.I made two more checks at the IMDb before getting back to the movie: the number of awards and nominations and the box office. Not surprisingly this was a low budget venture, and not surprisingly either it's garnered tonnes of awards and nominations. The studio made a profit off this one, but it's pocket change in comparison to the big blockbusters. Still, it must be a kind of Woody Allen and Orion kind of thing: movies like this make the studio look good.",

Now make them incredibly flat, paper thin, someone you could summarize in a line or two... Now have lots of stuff happen. Finally make everything look retro cool. Take great care to make the movie have \"look\" and \"feel\".The look and feel go a long way. I respect the care Anderson puts into his movies. But movies also tell a story. And with Anderson, something just doesn't work at this point. It's because either the story, or the characters need to not be paper-thin. Quantity of events, \"stuff happening\", number of quirky characters doesn't a story make. What or who are we supposed to care about? In Anderson's movies this is where the films just fail us. It is such a pity too, because we are so close to a good film.Rushmore had a good premise, some characters who, if developed would have been powerful. But halfway through I found myself not caring about what happened to anyone. Pity because it could have been a very nice movie about friendship. But instead it fizzled and faded and all was sort of this nice looking thing about a large number of quirky but still flat characters.Sorry but this is not good. Just hype. I had to watch some Fellini after this to get a fix of both characters and story. It can be done.",

It kept my attention, which is more than I can say for the majority of the normal \"summer blockbuster\" genre films.The writer (keep scrolling down) who wrote that anyone could have played Bill Murray's part and that there was no character development must have been watching a different film.  Most everyone evolves in this film.  I can't think of a character that doesn't, except maybe Max's father.I hate to critique other writers or their comments, but the line wasn't, \"Are you a barber or a neurosurgeon?\"  It was much better.  It was, \"So you're a neurosurgeon?\"  The barber says, \"No, I'm a barber, but a lot of people make that mistake.\"Go see it.

            "content": "Max Fisher is a combination of every parent's dreams and nightmares. In fact, despite this characters obvious social gifts, we see his teen angst rage against convention. In one sense he comes off almost as we would imagine a Holden Caufield in Catcher In The Rye. Is that a \"people shooting cap\"? Max is more complicated than an angry teen, and has more adult skills than many adults (particularly those portrayed in the film). He is proof that charm can carry a person through life almost exclusively, becoming a necessity as you rely more and more upon it. This brings us to Herman Blume, his life-battered mentor who has an obvious kinship with Max by way of his dislike of social convention. Early on in Rushmore, we learn there is no place in his heart for elitist philosophy: he tells the less fortunate among the prep school boys he is addressing to take aim at the rich boys, to bring them down. Ironically enough, both fall for the same woman, Rosemary Cross, a product of the most elite American institution, Harvard. Max even claims this to be his back up for college, behind Oxford and the Sorbonne. There are obvious parallels in this film to The Graduate. It is puntuated by music perfectly, and not with tired pop tunes (as are most movies these days with music incorporated). Max at times almost seems as though he were Benjamin, stalking Elaine at Berkeley. Jason Schwartzman excels as Max, as does Murray as Blume. Director Anderson does not avoid awkward moments, rather tackling them as subject in new ways. Some of this is done through great camera work, and some is accomplished by silence. Simply, he has made a daring, original film by letting us read the characters for ourselves.",

It is an amazingly original and smart piece of filmmaking, and there is not doub in my mind that it will be with us for years to come.  Director Wes Anderson has more than fulfilled the potential that he displayed in his debut film \"Bottle Rocket.\" Everything about \"Rushmore\" is totally first rate.  The script (co-written by Anderson and Owen Wilson, who played Dignan in \"Bottle Rocket\") is as sharp as they come and defies any sort of genre classification.  The performances are top-notch.  Jason Shwartzman gives the most memorable debut performances I've seen in a long long time and Billy Murry totally shines in a role that he was born to play. Rushmore stretches beyond being a simple high school movie and moves way past those sappy coming of age dramas where the only emotions seem to be laughter and tears.  People are going to be watching this one for some time to come.  If there is any justice in this world Bill Murray will be given an Oscar nod for this film.

I never sensed any real wit just a person with a good comic sense and a deft knowledge of how to work what sells as 'humorous' to American 20-something popular taste. I think he was the first to get the kick in the groin scene in a movie. So, I expected \"Rushmore\" to be a farce. A slapstick, wise cracking, prank filled college version of \"Caddy Shack\". Boy, was I ever mistaken. (Thank God) Instead what they gave us was a wise, lovingly frank look back at mawkish Male Teen Puppy Luv and forward to Middle Aged White Male resentment, depressed rage as self pity filled isolation. Superb.Every understated expression Bill Murray, as Herman Blume, made struck home. His semi-suppressed fed up disgust with his moronic, Disney fed, brain-heart empty, spoiled sons. His trophy wife who's just a trophy. A banal, rote life of commercial wheeling-dealing where only the final \"bottom line' counts.His middle aged Holden Cauflied (\"The Graduate\") character rings absolutely true. He's made his fortune, he's played by all the social rules, he has the American Dream of fortune, kids, wife, property and wealth but, so what ? In his college days, while others sought an end to the war in Vietnam he sat in his dorm room reading his National Review and smugly gloated over his collection of Brooks Bros ties. But now everything he has, everything he's done, everything he's earned is just vapid dust. It's a day in, day out stick in his craw. More of a reminder of his utter failure as a person than tribute to his socially approved role as a wealth making tycoon. Deep inside, if he had any real courage, any real character he'd scrap it all just to have a soul filled laugh, a life of meaning. But he's caught in the game. He bought into the false promise that true fulfillment  can be earned, bought. He gave up on creativity so that he could conform. He made the devil's bargain and found that the devil changed him. The devil ate him alive. He's soulless AND still living.Bummer.Heaven and Hell. Then he meets Miss Cross !\nOn the other end, Max Fischer, is all invention, cunning, imagination and youth filled exuberance. Hes made the same trade but from the other end of the age scale. He's a manipulator, self absorbed and In Luv. He cant be trusted. Hes funny but sinister.Hes ambition and energy without direction, common sense or, any maturity.Then he meets Miss Cross! The woman he selects to fall in luv with. She, finds him a curse and a burden.Both characters, in the end, find a higher level of existence through their relationship to her. She's their muse, their savior, their transforming OTHER. Their relationship with her is what this movie is all about. It changes their lives. It shows them a better way to be human while still being just human. To attain her attention and affection they must bust loose from themselves. To find yourself you must get beyond your self.And boy, do thse guys ever \"bust a move\". LOLSure, this movie is slow. Sure, it takes awhile to grasp the subtleties. We arent spoon fed the story line. We're asked to reflect, to think back upon our stages in our lives, our \"Max Fischer\" period and our \"Herman Blume\" period.The sad part is that while some people grow out of being Max few fail to avoid becoming Herman in the process. I know I never met my Miss Cross. I had to travel the bitter-sweet wisdom road alone. I hope you meet yours. But just knowing that you could someday will probably have to be enough. Deal with it.

It tells the story of Max Fischer (Schwartzman), who is a sophomore at the elitist Rushmore Academy, and is so absorbed in his extracurricular activities that he is in danger of failing out.  One day Max hears a speech by Mr. Blume (Murray), a wealthy businessman who has sons attending Rushmore, and they almost immediately befriend each other.  This oddball relationship between the lonely tycoon and the over-optimistic teenager begins to grow, but then Max discovers a beautiful young widow named Miss Cross (Williams) teaching first grade.  Max becomes very attached to her, but of course she is not as attracted to him, and things get more complicated when Max introduces Mr. Blume to Miss Cross.  I'll leave it at that.\tThe acting is a quality of Rushmore that contributes greatly to its appeal. I've seen a lot of Bill Murray movies, an I've always had a high opinion of him.  Saying that Bill Murray is good in a movie usually means that he was really funny (which, with a few exceptions, goes without saying).  In this film, though, there is something more to his performance.  With his facial expressions alone capturing the tortured soul of Mr. Blume accompanied by his impeccable comic timing, Murray is plainly terrific.  Jason Schwartzman is also outstanding as Max, although his appearance shows more years than the mere 15 he is supposed to be.  Olivia Williams is subtle and extremely effective as the British object of affection.  Finally, in a key role as Max's chapel partner, Dirk Calloway, Mason Gamble (from Dennis the Menace), convey's his bitterness and anger with such acuity and humor that one can't imagine that there he is actually acting in front of a camera. \nThe humor of Rushmore is so delightfully offbeat, hilarity sometimes being found in such places as silent pauses with the camera directed right at the actor's face, that it might not be for every taste (but be sure to give it a try first).   In fact, everything about this movie is different.  I've seen this film twice and from the surreal use of really vivid colors to the quick-paced direction by the obviously very talented Wes Anderson, it seems destined to have cult status in the future.  Finally, I would like to mention the soundtrack, a compilation of primarily British \"invasion\" rock (along with a brilliant original score), for it almost perfectly captures the spirit and life of this amazing achievement.",

You see it's about this kid, and a guy he meets, and a teacher he falls for, and goes a bit bonkers . . . But that just can't convey how deeply touching and thought provoking this movie is.  Just watch it and enjoy how it works on so many levels.  One more note - Bill Murray shows talent that has been lacking from him of late (see Osmosis Jones).

Firstly, this movie has the best music soundtrack ever, with older songs from Creation, The Rolling Stones, the Kinks, John Lennon, Donovan, The Faces and a great Mark Mothersbaugh score, sprinkled through a rich tapestry of great camera shots which perfectly fit every music selection.  All the casting from the very funny Bill Murray, to the versatile Jason Schwartzman, another one of the Coppola clan, and a whole cast of believable kid actors and captivating bit parts from the janitor, Max's Dad and the principal only add in driving home some of the funnier or more meaningful lines from the wonderful script.  Completely original, with a plot which goes far beyond the original two guys fighting over one girl plot line and truly captures what it's like to be a teenager.  Because of this movie, we can never forget Max Fisher, playwrite, actor, club former and leader.  From the makers of Bottle Rocket and The Royal Tenenbaums, yet more polished than Bottle Rocket and funnier than The Royal Tenenbaums, 10/10!!!!",

At first glance it seemed to mimick a previous relationship with an older woman that I had, so at first I found it sort of a remedy for a broken heart... Strangely though the romance felt like we were teenagers in love at some points.   Then soon I realized that although it was a teenager and a middle aged man in love with one woman, you can view it as one person... a childlike, appreciative, overzealous outreaching, shy person- the one aspect of personality, and then the other- a money making, washed up out of shape man.  I view that as a combination of who I or people in my age group... mid 20's to 20's, too old to do youthful things like sports teams, plays, going to classes.  Yet that desire to do those things was great.  Bill Murray's attempt at freshing up his life and is eventual falling in love with olivia williams character characterizes the working aged group at youthful romance. The ending provided that the two characters come to terms with each other to successfully win her affections.  The useful Max had to learn to grow up and take things seriously in his life and get out of his rut and do what he dreamed while Mr. Blume had to love and care for himself to win the affections.  In the end, it did not matter who won her heart, but that the two characters, the two halves similar to the two halves of ourself had to learn to come together to terms with each other and work together for the overall benefit. It's funny that you can call this a dark comedy, it's really therapeutic. And quite frankly, Bill Murray shows us why he's probably one of the most underrated, most important comics... still.",

I guess you've just gotta find something you love to do and then... do it for the rest of your life.For me, it's going to Rushmore.Wes Anderson's `Rushmore' is not just a dark comedy, it isn't `structured' like that at all, it has so much beauty that is seems like a drama.  So many beautiful performances and so many memorable moments (golf ball scene) it seems to be the greatest and most interesting comedy of all time.  I love its beautiful cinematography and it's all out perfect direction.  I loved this film so much that I may call it one of my favorite movies ever.  In its 93 minutes it is full of everything that makes a great comedy. It is full of thoughtful dialogue and interesting moments.  It is simply a brilliant masterpiece, a movie that rivals classics like `Dr. Strangelove' or `Fargo.' Yes I said `Fargo.'  It makes so much more then it could have been, this could have been slapstick then some gross jokes then back to slapsticks, but Wes Anderson's brilliant directions makes it beautiful then funny, it has it's own style.  It's not just artistic and weird it also is so very funny. It does more then just push the viewer to laugh it kind of makes us not laugh, it makes us think about the jokes and the situation then we laugh, only a few movies have ever done that.  I am a hard person to amuse when it comes to comedy but this film got right in me and did it all.We are all little boys doing only what we think we want and not what we need.  We are all ignorant and think that it is bliss, we are all like Max. He falls for the pranks in life and we laugh but the truth is we are just as bad, if not worse, than he is.  The film is something that creates its own genre of filmmaking it really does the job almost perfect and to a `T.' It has its own style and its own form of comedy, like others like `Dr. Strangelove' or `Fargo.'  What is great and almost the best part of those films is that they offer more then just sick jokes and stupid plot lines, they aren't about comedy.  This film does that and you can't help but to fall in love with every frame of this modern masterpiece.Mr. Blume: She's my Rushmore. Max: I know. She was mine too.The story is so interesting and involving that you just get sucked in. Every line is thought out and gripping.  Rushmore isn't anything like any comedy ever it has more then any comedy has ever offered.  Most comedies now days are cheap and easy to forget, this film sticks and sticks well.  Not one cheap joke, not one simple situation, to me that makes a perfect comedy one that gets you in a weird position.  It actually makes you think.  What a crazy idea a comedy that isn't simplistic!? This film is the best thing since `Fargo.'  It is the best comedy there is to see and one of the most beautiful, humane, and touching stories ever.  Rushmore is amazing.",

Rushmore is very different from other \"Bill Murray movies\".  I wouldn't say I really laughed at Rushmore at all the first time I watched it.  I wouldn't even say that I really even liked it then.  \"Bill Murray wasn't even that funny,\" I remember thinking.  I watched it again about a year ago because a few of my friends were obsessed with it, so I decided to give it another go.  The second time I watched it, I realized just how clever it is.  Upon repeat viewings, the meaning of the movie becomes increasingly naked and real.  Most people would argue that no one on earth acts like Max Fischer....and yet we do in so many ways, and it's so difficult to even detect.  That's what lends the film this sort of surreal feeling, and gradually the little witticisms become more and more humorous. I think that once people get past the fact that this is an atypical Bill Murray film, they'll adjust to the tone and style of the movie and find it quite charming.

As much different as they are, the two share the same theme: it's about the authentic love being struck, lost, and gained. Although Rushmore doesn't give you as much the depth as Forest Gump, but you get the same emotional experience from Max Fischer's love to Mrs. Cross and Forest Gump's to Jenny.It moved me to tears when in the final act Max has a closure in his yet-another play with a happy ending, as it did the same to me when Forest in the closing scene said his last goodbye to his love with a sad ending. Because authentic, innocent love, however silly or outlandish, has lived in everyone's heart at least once.

To give two examples I would point out the little kid who manages to appear in countless scenes throughout the movie, most significantly in the final scene and in Bill Murray's glorious Graduate-esque dive into the pool.  Also, did anybody else notice just how surreal the scene where Max pretends to get hit by a car is?  If you think about it critically it could only be some strange fantasy (I mean, he climbs onto the roof...), but it works perfectly within the logic of the film.

It gets under your skin and swims up into your brain where it lies forcing you to think about it for days, maybe even weeks after - the mark of good film making.Rushmore tells a story that is both incredible and ordinary and the way it melds the two together is what is so unique.

Rushmore is Bill Murray's most complete acting performance to date (and this is coming from a Murray fan). More than anything, this film made me truly appreciate the subtle art of filmmaking. A movie does not need to be the funniest, the saddest, the most creative, or most enjoyable thing out there, it has to be all of those things, and Rushmore very slyly manages to do just that. It sneaks up on you in an unassuming and humble way and by the end you just have no choice but to be impressed. A definite must see, suitable for just about any type of viewer.",

It brings you into the reality of the world of Max Fisher. He is a mix between brilliance and A.D.D. Every performance in the movie seems so well directed that as a viewer you never want the movie to end. Rushmore is the type of comedy that makes you laugh from your inner soul.

Contrary to the reviews of certain unscrupulous people, the music for \"Rushmore\" is not loud.  I happen to like the soundtrack very much, but even if it were composed of screeching spider monkeys, I couldn't call it loud, because it isn't.  Secondly, while the film does feature smoking, and what I might even call \"gratuitous\" smoking in that it's not a film about gangsters or Mafia hitmen, there are NO children smoking in this movie.  Yes, there are people who hate this movie so much that they will tell people that children as young as 10 are smoking cigarettes in the movie.  Not true; the youngest smoker is Jason Schwartzman, who is actually older than his character, Max.As a final note, I just want to add that everyone has their own personal tastes.  I have no problem with the idea that people hate this movie.  But when you overstep your right to hate the movie, you are ruining someone else's right to enjoy it.  Slandering a film is tantamount to destroying someone else's work.  If you hate this movie, fine; I see no reason why other people shouldn't be able to decide for themselves whether they like it or not.

You're better off watching another movie by Kevin Williamson or James Cameron, or perhaps sitting around with your disillusioned Film major friends talking about how no one can match Scorsese.

Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson, however, are two enormous exceptions to this rule.  They've made a brilliant film that rises above all my expectations.  \"Rushmore\" is the best movie with an adolescent protagonist since \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\"  It's not strictly a movie about high school, however; it's more about the vitality of youth and the allure of a man who truly knows what he wants to do.  What Max Fischer wants to do is lead a fascinating life, and that's exactly what he does.  Neither about \"geek chic\" nor \"teen angst,\" the theme of the film is \"accomplish your dreams.\"The wonderful thing about this film (as well as Anderson and Wilson's first film, \"Bottle Rocket\") is the balance of understated humor and delightful over-the-top action.  The humor isn't based on jokes, but on interesting and believable characters who don't fit into the real world's mold of a successful human.  Max is a metaphor for the voice inside our heads who gives us these wonderful ideas--ideas that never work in the real world. They don't always work in his world, either--in fact most of the movie consists of him failing miserably at one thing after another--but when they do, it's nothing short of miraculous.  Max makes plenty of mistakes, but he tries so many times that his successes far outweigh most people's.  A good point there.",

Not surprising, though, this is not the type of film the Academy likes to give awards to.

He is eccentric, humorous, greedy, lustful, jealous and fatherly, all in the film's two hours - and he does a great job at it.  Jason Schwartzman also does a fantastic job in his major motion picture debut.  Finally, Olivia Williams rounds out the lead trio with a touching portrayal of a character both emotionally sensitive, yet strong. There is humor is almost every part of this film, but it doesn't take away from a real plot with wonderfully developed lead characters.  Even the supporting roles are developed well and are neatly brought into the spotlight at various times throughout the film.  The director and the actors do a great job telling the viewer real stories about their respective characters, which help give us a full understanding of each one's complexity.  Not only are the characters complex, but they are also quite unique, which gives you a true respect for what the actors had to do to make their final coming-together seem realistic.

It takes a somewhat trite  `coming of age' story to the next level by incorporating a dry and darkly comic edge, exposing the melancholy behind youthful innocence and hopeless romanticism. This is accomplished primarily through the surreal maturity found in its young characters, but also with the tenderly problematic older ones. Overall, Rushmore dispenses a gloomy charm, as the events of the film constantly teeter over failure, yet remain focused on fanciful dreams of success. The result is the ability of the audience to overlook disappointment and cherish the love of creation: to love the actual process of achievement, no matter how impossible or unattainable the ends may seem. In essence, Rushmore illustrates a new love for life, questioning whether one can ignore consequences in spite of the trivial pursuit of fun and invention. 10/10",

Max meets local steel tycoon Herman Blume( Bill Murray, giving his best performance to date; he should have been nominated for an Oscar), and this leads to Max giving Mr. Blume an idea about building an aquarium to please a 1'st grade teacher at Rushmore, Rosemary Cross( Olivia Williams), for whom Max has fell in love with. Then problems happen as Mr. Blume also falls in love with her, leading to lots of hilarious moments. Rushmore has three great assets that make it one of my favorite movies: 1. Acting- All of the performance here are fantastic. Schwartzman as Max gives a high energy performance that is so perfect here; Murray gives a touching performance as a man who hates his life, while Williams gives a good performance as Miss Cross, while Seymour Cassel ( playing Max's father) and Sara Tanaka( playing Max's love interest) also give good supporting performances. 2. Script- The script is so great that it's just incredible. The dialogue involving handjobs is hilarious, but amazingly not over-the-top. 3. Music- The music is so perfect that one of my top priorities right now is to buy the soundtrack, if it's avialable. It's so full of perfectly coordinated songs, that even if the acting and script were terrible, the movie would still be good. I think that one of the problems in Hollywood is that there isn't enough movies like Rushmore. Rushmore is a brilliant film, and it's a film actually about people for once.",

I was totally engrossed in the world of Rushmore, wanting to know more about the other students, the teachers, Max's history and especially, Herman Blume.  This movie should be nominated for at least Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor for Bill Murray.  Murray gives one of the most tragi-comic performances ever captured on film.  Jim Carrey should be forced to sit down every day for the next year and watch this movie and see what real \"acting\" is about.Finally, if there were a Grammy-like best new performer award for the Oscars, Jason Schwartzman would win it hands down.

Jason Schwartzman is a revelation.  He makes his character both likable and unlikable in almost the same scenes.  This young man is the real deal.

Without a doubt, Rushmore is in my top 5 favorite flicks of the year. Rushmore was fantastic! I laughed more than I have in a long time. The key is that you have to appreciate dry, subtle, and deadpan humor. I assume you have all seen the film, so you know how great the whole Bill Murray poolside scene is. These kind of sight gags are what separate Rushmore from all the other comedies out there. The acting is superb, and the characters' idiosyncrasies are what make them so lovable. Max Fischer is blessed with a confidence many only dream of, and we become convinced that he could do anything he sets his mind to. The soundtrack is great too, having dug up many long forgotten british invasion groups that fit the film perfectly, like the kinks and 4+2. And Bill Murray deserves recognition for his performance. In short, I think that the majority of the US public has been subjected to low class, base, toilet humor for far too long, as is evident by those who hated this film or don't have the mental capacity to understand humor beyond fart jokes and semen in a woman's hair. Just look, \"There's ....Mary\" was a box office bonanza, while Rushmore is out of theaters in one month.That should tell you where America is at, and it should scare you too.

Max Fischer was real.I'm not going to go too much into the plot of this one - simply because just when you think it's going to go one way it does an about face and goes somewhere else.  Kind of like real life that way.  I'll just say this - I have never seen the process of \"growing up\" so accurately portrayed in film like this.Bill Murray was robbed, plain and simple.  That Oscar should have been his. Jason Schwartzman played a very complicated character and pulled it off stunningly.  Olivia Williams was wonderful.Houstonians will delight in the way our city is presented.  The Houston Heights never looked so good.

The screenplay (written by director Wes Anderson and actor Owen Wilson, who could also be seen in The Haunting) includes some great one-liners and spark-filled dialogue.

Moreover, Fischer is a brilliant playwright, whose talents (he wrote a one-acter about Watergate) in grade two that landed this barber's son a scholarship at this elite academy.Newcomer Jason Schwartzman is wonderful as the madly-driven, irrepressible misfit Max.  Bill Murray plays Mr. Blume, the rich industrialist alumni of Rushmore, becomes unlikely friends (and a father figure) to Max.  This is Murray's best performance to date.  His deadpan portrayal is laced with melancholy that is touching and surprising.  Olivia Williams portrays the young, recently widowed schoolteacher whom Max falls for.  Williams handles this role with sensitivity and grace.  The supporting characters are well-handled, all by child actors.Extra points are awarded to the writers and filmmakers for casting such a racially eclectic film in which Asians, two Scots (though one portrays an American) and blacks share the screen as complex, realistic characters.At times, Max is almost too clever for a boy of 15 and the believability of the film also strains, but sure enough the film bounces back with a fine story twist or touch of comedy to throw it back onto its twisted course.Though RUSHMORE pays hommage to films such as \"The Graduate\" and \"Barry Lyndon\" it bears closest resemblance to the black comic classic, \"Harold and Maude\" in which a young man enters a relationship with a much older woman. In this case, the much-older Murray befriends the 15-year-old Max.  In other words, two misfits find each other.  Also, the soundtrack relies almost exclusively on mid-60s British invasion bands, such as the Kinks, the Who, the Stones and even solo John Lennon, who altogether add an intelligent, hopeful feel to the film along the lines of \"Harold and Maude\".The highlights of the film are ironically staged plays of \"Serpico\" and \"Heaven and Hell\" performed by Rushmore's students.A good film has good supporting performances.  Sara Tanaka, Stephen McCole and Mason Gamble all come through as complex, believable characters.\nThe writing is witty and never falls into cliche.

Depression stops him briefly but he can't be kept down. and the loyalty of his friendI think there is a lot of symbolism about art and the creative process in this movie.  The cheesy pop culture ripoff plays (\"Serpico\" and \"Heaven and Hell\"), while hilarious, I think are symbolic caricatures representing art. Note the injuries suffered by Max in the process of bringing his creations to fruition... \"I didn't get hurt too bad\" I believe he says at the \"Heaven and Hell\" cast party after getting his face bloodied yet again...  I like the little tease with the dynamite and the pop gun, where you might think that Max is about to \"go postal\" at the school instead of using those tools to produce his opus.  This might be considered in poor taste by some after Littleton...There is more than a little symbolism in the clothing worn by Max throughout the movie as he undergoes his metamorphosis, evolving from the ever present Rushmore jacket, through the blue collar outfit and vest when Max is a barber, culminating in the flamboyant green velvet outfit at the Heaven and Hell premiere...In short, a really incredible, beautiful movie... please don't miss this!",

It is coated in the smooth comic shell of such films as Harold and Maud or dare I say Pulp Fiction. The acting by Jason Schwartzman is a superb character display. By putting up his awkward front the viewer is allowed to view deeper into his passions, obsessions and motivations. Olivia Williams plays the perfect muse of the affections of Schwartzman and Murray. Murray however somehow manages to shine above the rest in his odd and beautiful comic performances. The other great thing about this film aside from the performances is the music. This is what gave this otherwise serious story it's comic punch. Without it, Schwartzman would have been portrayed more as some obsessive compulsive serial killer than a confused teenager. Classic tunes from the Who and Cat Stevens made this movie work for me. You may not laugh even once during this film but it is sure to give you a big wide smile. This truly is divine comedy.

However Max suffers from a lack of study thanks to his abundance in his extra school activities and faces expulsion from Rushmore if his grades do not improve.Things get out of hand for Max when he falls in love with the Grade 2 English teacher (Olivia Williams) and from here on in Max has to battle his troubles with school and his personal life simultaneously.\nRushmore in my opinion is an absolute brilliant film. Wes Anderson tells this story with style and a unique craftmanship for his work, creating a querky, light-hearted and generally very fun film. It's hard to express the brilliance of Wes Anderson and his unique way of creating such a great film. He's a truly great individual and original film maker.I would rate The Royal Tenenbaums a slightly better film - as it's a more complete film than Rushmore, but equally funny and entertaining.I suggest watching this movie at least twice, as it only gets better the more you watch it!A brilliant film!

Jason Schwartzman, Olivia Williams, Luke Wilson and Brian Cox just to name a few are perfectly cast as well.The witty dialogue, even the tiniest gesture - a can you top this attitude and the musical score make this film a must see - one viewing is not enough -  you cannot absorb and observe the subtle not overt elements (look for the little things, even the wardrobe of the leads)with just one look.  Did I love this movie ..oo la la ..",

There is so much subtlety at work here, so much attention to every single nuance of character, so many subplots, that Wes Anderson masterfully and effortlessly juggles around, that upon my first viewing I couldn't believe how much was crammed into this film.I became a Wes Anderson fan after watching The Royal Tenenbaums, and looking back at this old gem, I can tell you how much better it is.  No, it doesn't diminish any of his other films, it is simply filmmaking on a whole new level.  Mr. Anderson is a director who knows his actors in the sense that he can and does make every scene count towards making his audience fall head-over-heels in love with his characters.  And I pity the cold heart that doesn't feel for Max Fischer, or smile when Margaret Yang (played by the beautiful Sara Tanaka) tells him that he treated her like a jerk, in a character turn that shows the audience that Mr. Anderson and his cowriter Owen Wilson aren't making a screenplay for any ol' teen movie here.You could say it's the music that makes \"Rushmore\".  You could say it's the details.  The way things set-up so well (such as how Max 'recycles' the bike Mr. Bloom thrashed).  Heck, you could even say those funny blink-and-you'll-miss-em moments bring smiles to your face.  Jason Schwartzman pulls off a seemingly effortless performance with just the right amount of honesty, longing and intelligence to make you not only believe his character, but understand why he is who he is.I know it's dangerous to label a movie as an instant classic, but there are no better words to describe how \"Rushmore\" made me feel. Bravo!",

I went into this not knowing a lot about the plot but that Schwartzman would be playing a student. Schwartzman's character Max is that classic Anderson character that I would have wanted, he is quirky, comical but still has depth. That is found in the other supporting characters too. If you love a character driven story this is ideal for you. It is much different from Anderson's newer films in which they are much more aesthetic driven but there are still the symmetrical shots and 'crime-like' sequences. I would recommend this to any avid film fan who doesn't mind an unusual story about relationships with adults during that coming of age period.",

            "content": "Rushmore is a completely engaging film that is really an arthouse comedy that thankfully made it into wide release.  Bill Murray is a hilarious and pathetic loser who strikes up a competition with another funny and pitiful failure of a 15-yr old, Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman).  Both of their performances are knee-slappingly comical and at the same time very touching. This movie reminded me of a more upbeat version of Welcome to the Dollhouse.  The scene that really killed me was when Max was drunk and out at dinner with Herman Blume (Murray), Max's love interest Rosemary (Olivia Williams), and Rosemary's friend the doctor.  Max, of course, made a complete ass of himself.  What do you expect from a kid who runs 50 weird extra-curricular clubs at school.  The entire cast was enjoyable, everyone from Dirk (Max's blond sidekick) to the Scottish bully.I believe that Murray is on a real streak now as far as the quality of his performances and the quality of his roles.  Unlike most of his Saturday Night Live comrades, he has done something with his movie career.  Eddie Murphy was good in the 80's but look at the crap he has done recently. Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, and Joe Piscopo aren't even respectable.  Jason Schwartzman is terrific in Rushmore and could possibly have a future in the movie business because un-like many of the young actors of today (i.e. Jennifer Love Hewitt, the cast of Scream), he actually has some acting talent.  Rushmore is a real pleasure and is so far the best movie of 1999.",

Max is real, and deep. We are along for the ride, and also are allowed to think for ourselves.The allegories are presented very nicely. I especially like the fact that Max starts out wanting to build a huge aquarium to woo the unreachable goal of his affections, but in the end as he is flying a kite with his old friend he discovers a love that was there all long.

            "content": "If you read the papers, leave your expectations at the door as Rushmore is something less than a comedy.  This heartfelt, though frequently comic and occasionally guffaw-able ramble through the inner workings of a young man's heart plays closer to drama.  Jason Schwartzman is perfect is both look and tone as lovelorn Max, and Bill Murray is, as always, Bill Murray (which is good enough for me).  Olivia Williams is completely charming as the beautiful bereft school teacher for whom Max pines, and Seymour Cassell is perfect casting as Max's content father.  The movie is defiantly offbeat in its viewpoint, teetering between comedy and drama and not fulfilling either genre's cup to the brim.Basic problems for me included: When Max is tossed out of Rushmore his immediate acceptance in public school is unexplored and unconvincing.  His ability to stage a mammoth play in a public high school is not believable and, excuse my density, to what point? That he continues to be Max?  Why a Vietnam story?  And why do Bill Murray's sons have Scottish accents?However, the major flaw in this film is the perpetuation of the idea that a man's (a male's, anyway) attention to a female MUST be reciprocated.  If it is not, the female is at fault.  Max, a charming though fairly overbearing fellow, falls for a teacher, Rosemary, who quite naturally, tells him no, you're too young.  This is the basis of the movie.  However, at the end of the film, Rosemary apologizes to Max for hurting his feelings and he forgives her!  How about Max apologizing for being a pedantic chauvinist in expecting Rosemary to love him just because he loved her?  And how about a callow teenage MALE teaching an - of course -  uncertain adult FEMALE that she isn't effectively dealing with her husband's death?  (Max must have learned this trick by effectively dealing with acne and bad grades.) Unfortunately, RUSHMORE sets Max to grow up and marry himself to his admittedly high-minded pursuits, while we can rest assured that his wife will toil in silence to make him happy and pay homage to his ambition. This is enforced by the fact that Max's new, age-appropriate girlfriend, who initially was smart and forceful, turns out to be a fraud who cheated her results on a science project; Max won't have to worry that he'll be challenged here.Unfortunately, basic male chauvinist tenets are reinforced at the teenage level through RUSHMORE, and the critics rushed forward all too happily to embrace them.  Welcome to America, Max, where women can't fight and die on the front lines but are free to suffer in everyday relationships.  You'll fit right in.",

Despite it only being Anderson's second feature, it still remains one of his best and the film which opened the eyes of the world to his work. The story follows a student named Max Fisher (played by Schwartzman) on a journey of love, hate and self discovery.This film is a true testament of the strengths we have come to expect from Anderson as a director and a writer. It has clever dialogue, complex and well written characters, great music and wonderful cinematography. In addition to this, Anderson creates a story so filled with dark humor and deep emotion it is impossible to look away.Rushmore is perhaps the most realistic coming of age depiction ever put on screen and there is a few reasons why. The film deals largely with the question of acceptance and what it means to belong somewhere. When we meet Max, it is clear that he belongs at his school Rushmore, this is until he falls in love with a school teacher named Rosemary and she becomes his new sense of belonging. Later in the film when he gets kicked out of school and repelled by Rosemary we therefore learn that behind Max's confident exterior is a real feeling of disconnection and that forces him on a coming of age journey.Max and many other characters in this movie can seem too quirky and weird at first glance, but it's their unfiltered personas that makes them real. As viewers, some of the decisions the characters make fills us with love for them, while others fills us with hate. However, we learn to accept and even like them all, despite their many flaws. This is when one realises that the story brings us on a similar journey as Max's and by the end of it we can just like him, accept all sides of ourselves and recognise that it's okay to be whoever we are, as long as we are open for change. In many ways, the story brings its own concept to us, we feel like we belong in this crooked world, mainly because of how we can find something relatable in every single character in this film. Whether it's Max's dark humor, self consciousness and passion or Herman Blume's feeling of regret, self hatred and dissatisfaction.This is a beautiful film about wounded hearts latching on to each other, whether your heart is wounded or not, I recommend that you latch on to this story and keep it close. What Anderson created with this film is the kind of magic you rarely see, much less experience.",

It involves blackmail, murder attempts, illegal-aquarium-building, and bee keeping, all within a 93 minute run time. That being said, it is also one of the funniest. Rushmore tells the story of a precocious 15 year old named Max Fischer attending a spiffy private school called Rushmore, and his increasingly bizarre attempts to woo a kindergarten teacher who he crushes on. Jason Shwartsman is brilliant in the lead role, imbuing a seemingly irredeemable character with a quirky charm. This film also features a hilariously deadpan performance from Bill Murray.Rushmore is Wes Anderson's first film to showcase his signature style, though it is not as well-defined as in his later works. The film is the earliest example of his stark camera movements, symmetrical framing, and deadpan dialogue. As such, it is perhaps the easiest film in which to spot Wes Anderson's influences, most notably Hal Ashby's quirky classic Harold and Maude. These elements give the film a unique charm, and have allowed it to endure as a cult classic. The one issue I have with this movie is that it perhaps too easily forgives the flaws of its protagonist, who at one point forcibly tries to kiss another character. However, this can be overlooked as the film's primary theme is forgiveness, and the protagonist undergoes a large amount of character growth. At its heart, Rushmore is a character study and a coming of age story, and is full of quirky charm, humor, and heart.",

            "content": "This is one of those rare films that not only had me frequently laughing out loud, but also continuously smiling. This is mostly attributable to the depth of the characters, as well as the skillful performances of Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman. It was refreshing to see character portraits that were not drawn as simplistic this-is-the-good-guy, this-is-the-bad-guy caricatures. Max is not a hero, but we root for him. His sometimes-despicable actions make us cringe, and yet one can only laugh as he and Murray's Blume, after their falling-out, resort to the dirty revenge tactics typical of passionate, spurned lovers. They, like most real people (as opposed to the cardboard cut-outs depicted in the vast majority of movies), are neither villains nor saviors, just people with good moments and bad moments.  What makes them worthy of watching, though, is their spark, their desire to achieve extraordinary results from their ordinary lives. Max is a poor academic student who nonetheless craves knowledge, an idealist who disguises his introversion by being outgoing.  At his worst, he is a petty, whining brat; At his best, he strives to bring out the best in others.Bill Murray is at his finest, and left me wishing he had more screen time. He is aware of the value of an actor's eyes, with a subtly averted gaze or barely-perceptible dawning registering much more than \"acting\" ever could.I imagine those who had an intense aversion to this picture (as evidenced by the postings here) had best go back to renting Armageddon for their cinematic stimulation. Obviously, the unconventional style of Rushmore left them addled and angrily confused, and the familiar blockbuster dose of a noisy, destruction-and-debris-filled ending (followed twenty minutes later by another noisy, destruction-and-debris-filled ending) will allay their fears that Hollywood is no longer going to produce mind-numbing feature-length music video crap anymore. It's okay, anonymous, don't weep--another by-the-numbers spectacular with a trite ballad by Aerosmith with be along any Friday soon, I guarantee it.",

It's a shame that such an intelligent, fresh coming of age film such as this will probably go unnoticed for the most part. The acting was great. a superb debut from Jason Schwartzman, a \"The Postman\" forgiving performance by Olivia Williams, and of course, there is Bill. I have to say, i really DO wish, and think he deserved an Academy Award nomination. Do Ed Harris and Robert Duvall REALLY deserve that? another bright note was that aside from the principal cast members, i found the whole supporting cast to be above-pleasing as well, which is usually rare in films like these. Anyway, add in the fantastic direction and scribe from our \"Bottle Rocket\" team Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson, and a FABULOUS British wave soundtrack and you've got one beautiful film.",

            "review_title": "Strange, but affecting",
            "content": "Following in the same odd-ball vein as \"Raising Arizona\" and \"Fargo,\" \"Rushmore\" focuses on Max Fisher, a private school genius, who feels the rules simply don't apply to him, in academics, in administration, and--particularly in this film--in romance. He defies every convention and authority with varying degrees of success. Max finds a hero in Bill Murray's Mr. Blume character who, likewise, has found a certain degree of success by violating social standards and going against the odds.Despite most reviews, this is far from Murray's best. However, he does a fine job with a strange character and you understand his plight, while not really identifying with it. He has worked his way to the top, and in the process realized this wasn't what he was bargaining for. He's in a loveless marriage, raising neanderthal sons, and entertaining and associating with people he despises. In Max he finds the boy without convention, with unabashed ambition, flawless manipulation of those around him, and boundless zeal and ingenuity to bypass every form of authority around him.This movie is unadulterated farce. Perhaps the funniest scenes in the movie come as 10-15 year olds play CIA agents, Vietnam soldiers, and members of the mafia in Max Fisher original plays. Juxtaposing these images with what children usually play in third or fourth grade plays (a carrot, a tooth, a tree, Ebeneezer Scrooge...), you understand this movie is not merely to be taken at face value but is probably more allegorical. While probably not as directly symbolic as, say, \"Grand Canyon,\" it definitely makes a comment about ambition and convention.Overall, this movie is not to be taken seriously. This is far from an Adam Sandler/Jim Carrey mindless comedy with plenty of sewer humor and sight gags. Unfortunately the story does have several (unnecessary) sexual overtones which detract from the movie's overall messages (although I'm sure many would argue with that). In the end, it's about ambition, disillusionment, convention and finding your place in the world. If those are themes you can identify with, Rushmore is worth your time.",

I'm not at all shocked that so many people have expressed their dislike for it, as you can feel nearly everything the characters are going through, and many people just aren't ready for that kind of realism.  It's not a comedy (although there are some moments that made me laugh out loud), it's not a drama, it's not anything, other than maybe a character study, and an explanation of how one young man learns to cope with everything.If you can handle it, this is a fantastic movie.",

The script was hilarious, the characters were unique, the score was infectious and the direction was sparkling youthful ingenuity.I love this movie so much because it has to be the only movie (or one of the rare,rare movies) that made me feel this great after I saw it.  It is the ultimate feel-good movie because it has ZERO amount of cheese and just the right dollop of..umm \"feel-goodness\" for lack of a better term.Max Fischer is the best character I've seen on screen.  What fascinates me about him is that technically he is so unreal--I don't know anyone and I can't imagine anyone being close to a Max Fischer--and yet in the movie he is made real, he is made incarnate as a believable human being--one with passions, faults, quirks, mannerisms, etc.In my opinion the movie was really about the maturing of Max Fischer. Max Fischer was a guy boy could--and did--do anything. From his enrollment in Rushmore at age seven he was an overachieving freak, an oversuccessful success story.  And in that sense, he was spoiled. Then he falls in love with Miss Cross and for the first time ever he has a goal he cannot achieve. By the end of the movie he has grown up because he lets this goal go; this shows in the resolution between him and Cross and Herman (Murray).There were so many beautiful parts in this movie: Max's speech in his new public school (he was a fish out of water, it was hilarious); the part when Max introduces Herman to his dad, a barber and *not* a brain surgeon; Max's first meeting with Miss Cross.. Every scene in this movie is perfect; the fact that the movie doesn't drag is a major plus.All in all, I loved this movie. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys a funny, feel-good movie.by the way, can someone please give me another word for \"feel-good\"?!?!",

Bill Murray is incredibly funny, doing the same shtick he does in The Man Who Knew Too Little (a pretty good film) and Charlie's Angels (God Awful crap).  Olivia Williams is incredibly beautiful, and Jason Schwartzman makes the film.  He's uncanny wit and his odd looks make him perfect for the role of Max.

Anderson's films celebrate the unusual among us, and not in that lame Hollywood way with drivel like Forest Gump.  The lead in the movie is a bizarre character and he is fascinating and endearing for it.  The thing I love best about Max is that he is so full of life and passion.Anderson is also a fantastic director.  The movie was shot beautifully (reminiscent of the style of \"The Graduate\") and there was (as with Bottle Rocket) a quirky yet powerfully emotional soundtrack.  Nothing about Rushmore is conventional yet--and this is important--it never tries to shock you in a cheap Hollywood way with violence, sex, or some special effects crap.  This to me is the ultimate in film making (and any art for that matter)--it is at once entertaining, intelligent, unique, emotional, and thought provoking.

Listen to the way the characters talk to each other, react to each other, listen to each other. Its the way real people act, and unfortunately it happens all too little in movies.

This movie does not cater to the half-minded, myopic film goer-s who just wanna sit and eat popcorn.  This movie must be thought about. Every little comment adds character and reality to the script, and Wes doesn't feel like he should have to show you when to laugh, those who pay attention and focus will fall in love with this movie.  Those who wait for scenes of bodyparts in zippers and waterboys tackling school teachers will be disappointed; i counted only one slapstick joke in the entire movie.  For those who judge it based on the color of trees during different seasons, be sure to note that the entire movie was shot in houston, and i only noticed one shot with any kind of temperate plant life, so Wes completely blew me away with his sets--i know, i'm trying to make tropical central florida look like connecticut--Jason S. is completely comfortable as a character, among acting virtuosos Bill M. and Olivia W.  It was also great to see some of the people from Bottle Rocket, who were just as good in this movie--Kumar is the best!!!--The thing that makes this movie so great is that the writers, Wes A. and Owen W. didnt seem to change their character and style to create this movie, and the entire film gives the air of \"i don't care if no one likes this, this is the way we do movies\"   Almost as if it was accepting the fact that some would love it, and others would hate it, unlike other films today [cough 8mm cough] and don't even tell me this thing didn't have style...anyone would be hard pressed to match this style, visually or technically.

Anderson had me in the grip of a masterpiece in comic clothing.In a deluge of adolesco-centric hormone-drenched films, *Rushmore* stands on mythic ground.  Young Max (Jason Schwartzman), the \"Fischer\" King, is Arthur, full of dreams and schemes for the glory of his beloved Rushmore Academy/Camelot.  A world-weary alum/knight, Herman Blume/Lancelot (Bill Murray), offers friendship and betrayal on a monumental (literally) scale. For they both love the fair (and English) Miss Rosemary Cross/Guinevere, even as they love Rushmore/Camelot.And don't think that only the central plot structure of Arthur-Lancelot-Guinevere is present.  Indeed, there is a delightful and deep purity in Dirk/Sir Galahad.  The elusive Holy Grail may be harder to nail down--I think it's actually what motivates young Max to start all of his numerous escapades.  Or is it in fact Max's more noble goal--like Arthur--to provide charismatic leadership to his disaffected, prefabricated, ready-for-the-corporate-mill school chums?  Not unlike what Arthur and his romantic chivalry was to Middle Age England...Wes Anderson may just be our times' Tennyson, with his *Rushmore* a wonderful parallel to *Idylls of the King.*Add to this incredible retelling of a slightly mad young Man's kingly aspirations solid writing, brilliant camera work, inspired acting, outstanding use of slow-motion, and hauntingly perfect soundtrack, and you've got the makings of a true masterpiece.Thanks for bringing this reviewer out of a dreck-induced funk!

            "content": "Rushmore doesn't have Gwyneth Paltrow. It doesn't have Ben Affleck. It doesn't have meteors, a high intensity street shoot-out or any special effects to speak of. It does have one thing that plenty of recent movies don't seem to have: good actors, good acting and a decent story.Rushmore is a posh boy's academy where our hero, Max Fischer [newcomer Jason Schwartzman] gets an extensive education in everything except academics. I suppose the foundation of the story is familiar: boy meets girl, boy falls for girl.... The boy in this story is Max, who spends so much of his time founding and participating in extracurricular clubs for every and all hobbies [such as beekeeping, fencing, chess, Model UN] that he neglects his studies and is in danger of failing out of his beloved Rushmore. The girl is a first grade teacher at Rushmore, Rosemary Cross, played by Olivia Williams who you might remember from \"The Postman.\" Then again, you might not. The best friend-cum-traitor is Herman Blume, a captain of industry trapped in an unhappy marriage, smartly played by Bill Murray. The movie centers around one basic maxim that is sweet, poignant and genius when uttered by the braced teeth and bespeckled Max: \"The key to life is finding something you love to do and doing it for the rest of your life.\"I won't ruin the end by telling you which, if any, of the characters fulfill this maxim, just that Anderson and Wilson don't patronize us by handing us a neatly wrapped happy ending. It's relatively certain that the future is hopeful and happy for our players, but the characters are complex enough that we can rest assured they face normal lives full of joy, sadness, failures and contentments, too.Possibly the best element of Rushmore is that the three main characters all have some undesirable personality traits that allow them to be less static. The characters aren't cut and dry, all bad or all good. They have depth and can be equal parts caring and cruel. Save some over zealous eyebrows and some growing up, there is virtually nothing unlikable about Max Fischer. He's the kind of character that approaches each task in his life, including his life as a whole project, with genuine earnestness. Miss Cross is there to remind us that dignity, reservation, gentleness and kindness are beautiful. Max reminds us that while passion, devotion, obsession, and compulsion may seem grotesque and overwhelming, they, too, can create beauty.On a side note, it was tremendously comforting as a former Girl Scout and Flag Corps Captain to see the celebration of a hero who preferred to crusade to require his classmates to study Latin for five years than to wear a football jersey.",

The writing is excellent, camera work fresh, and the performances by Jason Schwartzman, Murray, and Olivia Williams are superb. The script was probably my favorite aspect of the film, utilizing lines from other films, old racial slurs rarely heard today, and never has the phrase 'hand-job' been so funny. Watch closely for surprise appearances by BOTTLEROCKET alum's Luke Wilson(Owen's brother), Kumar as Mr. Little Jeans, and Futureman(also a Wilson brother) as the baseball coach. Also, Max's final play, a sendup of APOCALYPSE NOW, is hilarious. 10 out of 10.",

This film walked the razor's edge between quirkiness for its own sake and true insight into the human soul and, in my opinion, succeeded. Interestingly, the trailers for this film turned me off; it just looked like another teen comedy; a bit different, perhaps, than the current vogue of films using TV icons who have the vapid look of JC Penney catalog models, but looking a little too self-consciously hip and arty nevertheless.

            "content": "Wes Anderson is not a simple person, yet he directs films about simple people whose quirky personalities create somewhat complicated stories. Sort of...Well as you can tell, describing a Wes Anderson picture is a perplexing task.Rushmore is a story about a 15 year old scatter-brained jack-of-all-trades named Max (played by newcomer Jason Schwartzman).  Max is given scholarship to a prestigious prep school following the success of a stageplay he writes while in the 2nd grade.  Life thereafter is not easy for Max for his IQ is not quite average, yet he dreams big.  One day Max befriends a wealthy booster named Herman.  Bill Murray's portrayal of this character was Oscar-worthy.  He wishes he had a son like Max and makes his malcontent with his own children obvious throughout the picture.  Ultimately, Max and Herman fall in love with one of Max's teachers, Mrs. Cross, and what ensues is one of the most charming and unique love triangles ever filmed.With Rushmore, subtlety is everywhere: cinematography, scene composition, dialogue, and of course acting.  What makes this film so wonderful is the manner in which the audience can find faults with all the characters yet they're so richly developed that you still embrace them.  There is no over-the-top conflict between characters in Rushmore.  In one pivotal scene Max and Mrs. Cross exchange sentiments that they've never met a person quite like the other.  I've never quite seen a film like Rushmore.If there is one minor critique of Rushmore, it would be that Anderson seems to be intentionally unconventional with scene transition, which was more annoying than artistic.All considered, I still consider this gem a splendid 10/10.*psssst* Make sure you see \"Bottle Rocket\" too!",

I hate that there is a thousand word limit on these things, because I could talk about this one all day.  Never before have I seen a film that so perfectly melted the humor of a situation with the pain and awkwardness that ultimately result in each scene.  It is truly fascinating to see how these characters react to each situation presented. Sometimes we got humor, other times we got these incredibly complex and painful situations.  What makes things interesting is that we never knew what was going to come about, and that was the true test for Wes Anderson here.  It is a daunting task for a director to try and evoke so much humor, pain, sorrow, and ultimate redemption in one film, just ask Robert Altman, and Anderson does it masterfully here.  It is nice to see Anderson growing up and coming in to his own as a director. I enjoyed his previous Bottle Rocket, a very interesting film, but found it a little boring in stretches. With Rushmore, Anderson has created a masterpiece of a film that is an instant American classic.  Bravo!",

Wes Anderson superbly and subtlely portrayed those emotions on film.So many people who have seen the movie have said they just can't stomach Max's character.  I think they miss the vulnerability he so astutley covers up.  I think Max is really just an overachiever who misses the love of a mother who died when he was very young (which may explain why he yearns for the love of Ms. Cross-an older woman).I thought a highlight of the film oft over looked was its music. The twins' birthday party scene showing Blume stoicly tossing golf balls in the pool whilst his wife is flirting with another man across the way over the Kinks' 'Nothing in this world can stop me thinkin bout that girl' was just magnificent.  A scene that sends the chills down my spine every time is when Blume claims Ms. Cross is his Rushmore and Max replies while walking down a grass incline, \"I know, she was mine too.\" as the Stone's 'I am Waiting' begins.

Im not going to sit here saying how clever and blackly funny this film is all i can say is it is very enjoyable, criminally underlooked and makes you remember how great movies can be with out the usual reservoir dogs violence or sex or swearing every second.

            "content": "\"Rushmore\", as so many others on this website have already pointed out, is subtly drawn movie that is actually better with multiple viewers.  Whether you consider it to be a great comedy or not really depends more on your sense of humor than on Wes Anderson's script, but that's true for any comedy.This film is worth seeing for Bill Murray's performance alone, easily one of his best.  The rest of the cast is also pretty solid for that matter, especially Jason Schwartzman.   There are a few things about this movie that bother me, and most of it centers on the character of Max Fischer (not Schwartzman's portrayal of him).  Maybe I shouldn't be so critical, but I can't justify calling something a cinematic masterpiece simply because it is being compared largely to a bunch of second and third rate films that had no business being made in the first place.  Still, by all accounts, `Rushmore' is a very good film and deserves most of the accolades it has received.\n****************SPOILER ALERT***********************In the movie trailer, Max is compared to the likes of Leonardo, Shakespeare, and Einstein, some of the greatest human beings to ever step foot on the planet Earth.  Max is certainly great in his own mind, and he probably has the potential for greatness in the real world.  Maybe it's just me, but Max comes across as a pathetic overachiever.   Sure he is involved in every school activity under the sun, and can deliver the occasional wry comment or two, but he is too caught up trying to be everything to everyone that he doesn't really appear to be much of anybody at all.  At least, that's all Wes Anderson allows us to see of him.  Take for example Max's student plays. His plays cover some potentially entertaining subject matter, but do we ever really know if he is a great playwright and/or director?  Who knows? This is an interesting theatrical device by Anderson, but we only get a small nibble of what Max is doing on the stage.  There isn't anything shown in `Rushmore' to suggest that Max has any real talent as a playwright.  I wish Anderson would have done more with these play sequences, perhaps used them more as a vehicle for Max to woo Miss Cross instead of the -\nAquarium.  When Max asks Herman for $8 million to build the aquarium for Miss Cross, the two of them aren't exactly best friends anymore.  Is Herman really crazy enough about Miss Cross to throw away 80% of his net worth to help Max get this aquarium built so they can impress her?  Well, I suppose if we can believe that Max is the next Bill Shakespeare we can believe this as well.Lastly, why in the heck does Max give up on Miss Cross in the finale and settle for Margaret?  This seems totally out of character for him.  We spend two thirds of the movie watching Max scheme and make a total w**ker out of himself to try and win a woman over twice his age.  Despite all his hair brained plans and seemingly hopeless efforts, I couldn't help but sympathize and root for the guy after awhile.  Then for whatever reason, he throws in the towel at the end.  Damn Max, you really are pathetic.",

            "review_title": "Very Original",
            "content": "The 1998 film \"Rushmore\" is categorised as a comedy drama and stars Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and Olivia Williams. The film was written by Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson. Wes Anderson also directed the film and I can't praise him enough for his impressive and unique talents. This was the second film he directed and I feel that \"Rushmore\" is his finest production in comparison to all of his films. Credit is also due to Jason Schwartzman in his debut acting role. He was only 18 when Rushmore was released and he is still acting to this present day. I can't imagine how surreal it would have been for him to co-star with Bill Murray in his first debut film, especially as Schwartzman was the lead role.Schwartzman plays the character Max Fischer, a rather unusual 15-year old schoolboy who attends the prep school \"Rushmore\". He is failing in most of the classes at the school but manages to balance his rebelliousness by being very active in extracurricular activities. Very early on in the film Max ends up getting expelled from Rushmore resulting in him to joining a local high school. This is pretty much a downward spiral for Max as Rushmore was his life. Before his exclusion he becomes close friends with Herman Blume (Bill Murray) a local wealthy man who has two twins in the same class as Max. Max and Blume form an unlikely friendship and Max also finds himself obsessed with the new elementary teacher at Rushmore Ms. Cross (Olivia Williams). However, he soon discovers that having these \"friends\" much older than himself leads to him becoming involved in unexpected dramas. I love the soundtrack throughout the film. The music felt very original, which is something I hadn't noticed before. I will definitely have to purchase the soundtrack for this. The songs featured in the film are mainly late 60's/early'70s British pop and rock music, and they all cogitate Max's current mind- set. I was most impressed with the originality of the film in general. It's difficult to compare it to anything else as there isn't anything quite like \"Rushmore\". I think one of the biggest shocks was discovering Owen Wilson started his career as a writer and then gradually made his way into acting. He has only ever co-written along with Wes Anderson but it's been a while since they collaborated as writers and I would be very keen for them to start a new project together in the future. The first time I watched Rushmore I wasn't that involved with the film and felt it was rather mediocre. I had heard great things about it and I felt rather disappointed with my perception. However, it wasn't until recently that I rewatched Rushmore and made a really strong connection with the film. I also paid more attention to the plot which certainly helped me follow the film and receive a better understanding. It makes me want to watch more films I didn't enjoy first time viewing. I also strongly recommend to film buffs out there. It's not the type of film any average Joe would enjoy simply because it's so original and also quite dated now.",

Max Fisher (Schwartzman) is a student who falls in love with Miss Rosemary Cross, a teacher at the university. This love is not only impossible because of the age difference, but also because Rosemary is widowed from her late husband of which she hasn't fully recovered from. But Max is a clever boy and tries to win her love with the help of the university's principle Herman Blume (Bill Murray). They're good friends and both have the same kind of humor. But when Herman meets Rosemary he falls in love with her too. Now the friends become rivals. This creates some very funny moments between the two of them. This movie is brilliant for it entire credits. The writing and directing is outstanding and the performances of the actors are nothing less. Schwartzman is so dedicated to his acting that you don't see him as an actor but as Max Fisher, the intelligent and devoted  student. Bill Murray again proves he's the king of comedy. His 'dry' humor, as we call it in Holland, is perfectly in line with the sarcastic humor of Schwartzman. It's the same sort of comedy as 'Wonder Boys'. It truly is one of the best comedies I've ever seen. A must see",

Although the movie seems targeted, in its ads and promos, as a Jim Carrey slapstick comedy, it's far from it. The movie has a mature and caring mood to it.  Although hardly realistic in a sense, the shots and presentation seems very relistic.  As I recall Wes Anderson directed Bottle Rocket.  Similar in mood, the movie has an Un-American feel, yet it still retains the American feel (rich businessman, independent youth, and ie. public and private school).  The movie has many underlying themes, probably  the biggest is some sorta generation gap thing (come to think of it . . . Rosenblooms article in Chicago Reader sums up the movie nicely).  There is also the sense of getting on with loss . . before i give up too much of the movie, it does have the underlying theme of coping with some sense of loss and a searching.  The main character, although free-spirited in an american way, at 15 yrs old, seems mature and although good spirited has his flaws, as almost ALL teenagers do.  The movie, or film, doesn't condescend the viewers toward the characters but lets them go with the very believable characters.Basically I can't pin down where Wes Anderson got his inspiration for the movie, but a few weeks after seeing this film, there are still scenes in the movie that have burned into my brain.  (For some reason kite-flying seems central to the movie, . . . don't know how to explain it.)One could say it's a lighthearted (not condescending, since I feel Rushmore has more warmth) Mike Leigh film, or a somewhat American Bill Forsyth film.. . . Maybe the reason for some of the english and scottish/irish characters in the film.Mark",

I haven't seen a movie this witty and hilariously subtle since \"Dr. Strangelove;\"  the acting is terrific, the directing is impeccable, and the script trusts the intelligence of its audience; never once do you suffer through a drawn-out monologue or boring voice-over explaining what you already know to be happening.I've read comments from people who didn't \"get\" the movie, who couldn't understand what was even going on in the film.  This is a forgivable offense, because you can't really expect an audience that has been served with fast-paced, plotless action movies and brainless, puerile, obscenity-driven comedies to recognize a good story when they see one.

It would be impossible to accurately explain all the clever twists, turns and lessons that both Max and Herman learn in their quest.  Just go see it!

Rushmore, the second film from writing team Owen Wilson and director Wes Anderson, proves that not only was the charm of Bottle Rocket not a fluke, but also that even the best can get even better. Watching Rushmore was an almost transcendent experience. This near perfect film works on every conceivable level, from the brilliant script to the incredible performances by all of the actors, all of which is directed with a flawless grace and style. Rushmore very well may be my new favorite movie. I can't wait to see what Wilson and Anderson come up with next.",

Jason Schwartzman's portrayal of Max is perfect as the likeable underachieving kid with extracurriculars coming out of his ears, and a desire to impress a kindergarden teacher by building her an aquarium that she doesn't want.  Bill Murray's acting is subtle which caught me by surprise, as I was expecting his usual flamboyance. He certainly delivers a solid performance here, but perhaps not as good as all the critical acclaim and hype would suggest.  The movie does appear quite disjointed at times (but this is probably the whole point) and it certainly loses some of it's comedic steam toward the end.  All in all, if you can handle the random, quirky humor, and appreciate the subtlety, you just may end up loving this highly original film.",

Bill Murray is wonderful as well in his own \"Bill Murray Way\". Rushmore is full of brilliant and SMART COMEDY, not immature/lowball humor (poop & sex jokes,etc) that you see in more mainstream comedies.Rushmore is truly a remarkable film. It's really involves emotions and relationships while adding a great side of comedy to them. I think that the people who said this film was \"boring\" aren't seeing it for what it really is. I imagine that those people attend theatres regularly looking for overdone special effects and overrated stars Rushmore has probably one of the best soundtracks ever. (The Who, Kinks, Cat Stevens, and The Faces just to name a few) I really suggest you check it out. Guess what!? It's not a cd full of sorry music you won't hear in the film!!

I read through the negative comments, and I see how people didn't \"get\" it- it sounds like they all came in with pretty lofty expectations. Rushmore delivers in every way, but it's a very quirky movie. There are so many wonderful subtle moments- like when Mr. Blume realizes that Max has put bees in his hotel room. His look goes from admiration, to amusement, to pure anger in about 3 seconds. And notice how Dirk Calloway is sweeping up cocaine after the 'Serpico' play is over. Or how about the time when Max's dad is getting him out of jail, and the guard hands him his shoelaces (so he wouldn't hang himself). Max says \"can you drop me off at school, Dad? I have to get a teacher fired\". Max's dad says \"I wouldn't recommend that, Max\". Or the scene where Max goes to the hospital to visit Dr. Guggenheim, who is in a coma. Max hands Mrs. Guggenheim some flowers, but they look like a bunch of weeds. Mrs. Guggenheim replies \"These are glorious!\" There are so many of these moments, but as you can see they are things that you may miss the first time you watch it. I myself thought the movie was so so, I didn't really \"get\" it either when I saw it in the theater. But then I saw it on video, and I really liked it, then I got the Criterion DVD, and fell in love with it. So is this still my litmus test movie? Yeah, I think it is.

However zany the schemes and witty the one-liners, Rushmore stands out in my mind (and as one of my favorite movies) with its true-to-life qualities concerning love and friendship. Over the course of the film, private school sophomore Max Fisher (Jason Schwartzman) and steel-baron millionaire Herman Bloom (Bill Murray) become friends, then enemies, then friends again, however uncertain their futures are, and the same for Max and his relationship with grade-school teacher Miss Cross (Olivia Williams) and his chapel partner Dirk.\nThat is little to say about director Wes Anderson's now-trademark scripts (co-written with Owen Wilson) and style. Rushmore was one of the best, most original films of 1998, and prepared the public for his equally-excellent The Royal Tenenbaums. Over the course of his small filmography (also including 1996's Bottle Rocket), he has set the standard for his unparalleled mastery of the montage, most notably used in Rushmore to transition between the months of Max's sophomore year.As for the idea that Max Fisher is one of the most unlikeable characters ever conceived, I must note that I was fifteen when I first saw Rushmore, and I was reminded of myself in Max - sans the whole self-destruction and teacher-loving. So perhaps I can't understand the argument.I will openly admit that I didn't immediately praise Rushmore after my first viewing, and I urge nay-sayers to give it a second try. It is easily one of the finer American films made in the last five years, and it at least deserves some credit for its originality - something Hollywood always seems to be lacking.My score: Five stars - One of the very few five-star ratings I have given out.",

Unfortunately, Blume falls in love with her too.This movie is, for lack of a better word, a masterpiece. Everything about the movie, from the acting, to the writing, to the direction are fantastic. Wes Anderson is a direction genius. His movies are very original, and still have a wide appeal. Anderson co-wrote this picture with Owen Wilson. The two also teamed up for Andersons' Bottle Rocket and The Royal Tenenbaums, in which Wilson co-starred.Jason Schwartzman, in his first role, is endearing as Max Fisher, an overachieving underachiever. Bill Murray takes a chance with Herman Bloom, a type of character he is not accustom to. Personally, I think he should have at least been awarded an Oscar nomination for this role, but the Academy turned a blind eye, much like they did with Gene Hackman in The Royal Tenenbaums. In any case, it may be the best role of his career. Rounding out the excellent cast are Olivia Williams(Ms. Cross) and Seymour Cassel(Max's dad, Bert).",

Anyway, there isn't much that one can say about this extraordinary cinematic feat.  The film's theme can be summarized by the quote that Max finds inside of Edward Applebee's book in the library.  I will not state this quote but once one has seen the movie they will understand the simple premise of such a remarkable screenplay.  At the end of the day, I would have to believe that if everyone followed this mantra, of doing what they like to do, they will be happy in all that they do. That's all.",

Just the fact that he got away with all that he did.

The fascinating aspect of Wes Anderson film is that you cannot find absolute definition for characters. His characters are of great complexity, and are perfect examples of the 'anti-gravity' parts of the human nature. And because of this, his behaviour, although seems absurd, but also shows his positive side: a young man trying to find acceptance and win respect, in spite of failing to get good grades. The definition of success is challenged by him.\nDramatic plots, polemic-style lines and the sad, embarrassing moments of the characters together compose this comedy-drama. When watching it, there are many hilarious moments, but a deeper sense of the frustrating obstacles also responds the viewers as we all experienced those emotional fluctuations. The embarrassing emotions and thoughts as a teenager are not a dreadful thing to avoid, but the treasure of the complex human nature.",

Rushmore has deep, pensive moments, and it also has sequences that are downright giddy in their pleasant demeanors. A character like Herman Blume (Bill Murray), probably in his late 40's, speaks with the same amount of respect to our protagonist Max's young chapel partner Dirk, a boy no older than twelve. And with all of the respect that each of the characters has for the others, you'd hardly expect that Max would be such a hard boy to like. He's selfish, cunning, and occasionally downright mean. But what keeps us from hating Max is that all of his actions are driven by love. Love for his school and love for Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams), a first grade teacher at Rushmore Academy. As Max's relationships with both Miss Cross and Mr. Blume evolve, those two eventually fall for each other, sending Max into a kind of downward spiral that tests his lust for life and all of his friendships.

The kid, a beaten up genius to have survived so long, is a hero you sympathize with for his weaknesses and by whom you are mesmerized in his moments of wild invention. All around him, including the exceptional Bill Murray, the film is jewelled with a rich array of eccentric, peculiar and delightful characters.

If you relate with Max's predicaments - feeling alienated from your peers, associating better with adults - and if you see some part of yourself at 15 in Max, you'll find him sympathetic, charming, and even lovable despite his flaws [which all good characters have].I, personally, have never walked out of a movie. (For starters, that's an expensive practice.) The worst I've done is turn off a film (NATURAL BORN KILLERS) which I had begun watching on cable because I was bored and I loathed it. While I was engaged with RUSHMORE... laughing, almost crying, glowing with wonder at the way this film is made, I know that there are people who didn't feel the same way. I think this film plays to a specialized audience, but even so, there are far worse films out there right now, with worse moral & ethical problems than cigarettes, and with a good deal less production value and care put into their making.Go see it if you think you'll like it. If you seem to identify with the people here who didn't, maybe you'd better save you $8 -- but anything can surprise you. Wes Anderson surprised me: long live RUSHMORE.",

I found no sympathy or empathy for any characters, but I liked them nonetheless.  It had its moments, funny and dramatic, but overall, it was a very well constructed movie.

I'm happy when a movie forces me to think, and more importantly, lets me draw my own conclusions and decide for myself where the dramatic moments are.  I HATE movies like \"Meet Joe Black\", where there's a yucky pseudo-classical soundtrack telling you \"cry here\".  If you know what I'm talking about, you may like Rushmore.The characters aren't totally likeable for the whole film, but that gives it weight.  It definitely will strike a chord with anyone who felt disenfranchised in high school, or who ever took a crush too far.  Don't expect screwball comedy like \"There's Something About Mary\".  I imagine that most who disliked this film expected something light and weren't prepared for a 15-year-old self-destructing over a teacher.  If you want total bubblegum escapism, look elsewhere.  If you want characters with flaws and some meat to them, look here.Oh - it's really funny as well.  The twin brothers in the film who wrestle and get crossbows for their birthdays and punch each other for the front seat are what I think of when I try to guess who didn't like this amazing film. \"Dude!

Max isn't an outsider because he wants to be, he just can't help himself.  He's a boy with too much potential, but without the resources to realize it. Initially, he plows through life saying and doing things without concern to those around him that he proclaims to care about.  He's heartless and cruel. It's only through losing all that he holds dear (Rushmore Academy and Ms. Cross) that he begins to evaluate himself.  He doesn't have any major epiphanies, or life-altering experiences, he just \"grows up\".It's in the third act that you realize how thoughtful Anderson is.  I won't give it away, but the final scenes are both unexpected, and the perfect ending to a story that doesn't just reward the outsider, but shows how, when given a chance, he can enrich both his own life and those around him.",

Wes Anderson has an extremely wacky but sophisticated sensibility that only rarely arrives to the big screen. \"Rushmore\" drives this home.From the opening montage, it is clear that this director knows exactly what he wants and is in control.  The art direction is in complete harmony with the theme and humor.If you look closely, you will see that this story is really an autobiographical sketch in disguise.  Wes Anderson clearly identifies with Dustin Hoffman in Mike Nichol's \"The Graduate.\" Through the main character (wonderfully played by Jason Schwartzman), it is clear that this identification is a painfully personal one (I could swear there is a bit of a homage to Peter Sellers going on in Schwartzman's droll deadpan style of acting). By \"making love\" to the film \"The Graduate\", Anderson manages to use the visual vocabulary of a film that he most obviously worships to express a personal awkwardness or alienation from others.The key to Anderson's direction is that he never takes himself completely seriously.  The character in the film takes himself seriously but not the director making the film. This is what makes \"Rushmore\" both wacky and sophisticated. Anderson manages to be embarrassingly honest through visual sophistication. The main character is both years older than his age but at the same time embarrassingly naive. Lovely.",

After about the second episode, I realised that there was something far deeper, far more intricate to this story than the base plot. I was drawn in, perhaps hypnotised by the incredibly awesome soundtrack, and that served to stay my attention long enough so I could pick up some of the more subtle points.I had vouched to the said friend that I would not stop watching the movie until I 'Got It'. It was perhaps a month later before I could say I truly did. Imagine the writer piecing together bits and fragments of any number of surreal dreams he had, tied together with some obfuscated theme. Some of the events in the film - Bill Murray running like a madman from the playground after handing Miss Cross a note? - can only be explained as a result of this deduction. And I must say, it was a very good job.I can't say how many times I've been walking to or from class, and imagined myself as Max Fischer, cigarette in mouth, donning a bright green suit, with an air about him (myself) as would be that of a specter, or apparition. Who can tell what Max was thinking in his transitionary period? Vague and distant eyes looked out with disdain upon all they saw.This movie, without a doubt, changed my life.

            "content": "If you know a little about this movie, there might be pieces of information in this review that might conceivably be considered spoilers.  Concievably. You're warned!When I say \"Rushmore\" is one my personal favorite films, I mean it in the most direct way.  It sticks with me primarily for personal reasons.  I can't really bring myself to be particularly objective about it because I love it. Still, I can admit that \"Rushmore\" has some serious flaws.  For example, many people will be repelled by Max, the unorthodox hero of the film, and will be unable to enjoy it.  Those who can identify with him even a little can still find other things to dislike about the film.  Most important are the flaws in the story, which seems to promise a wildly comic battle of wills between Max and his rival for the affections of the woman he adores, but never really delivers.  It's actually somewhat anticlimactic.Personally, I was most aggravated by a wretchedly cutesy, annoying, and entirely predictable story involving a secondary love interest.  \"Rushmore\" succeeds primarily as a drama rather than a comedy, and it seems a bit unfair that the characters are left to their rather dull comedic destinies rather than something a bit more original and sincere.  It's almost like the uniformly excellent and engaging performances work against the quirky, if sometimes lightweight direction. All this seems like nitpicking, though, whenever I'm actually watching the movie.  It always engages my attention, and leaves me feeling unusually satisfied.  I am unable to stop myself from adoring \"Rushmore\".",

            "content": "The sophomore effort of Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson, Rushmore is similar to the best works of Hal Ashby (Harold & Maude) and Mike Nichols (The Graduate) in tone.  Beautifully framed and shot, it is almost fairy tale like in it's introverted scope, allowing us to become intimate with characters who surely are too wonderful and real to exist in our world.The fractured relationships between it's three leads are as human and fragile as the aforementioned, and even the side stories are fully realized and moving (ie.  Max and his Father).  Jason Schwartzman (as Max Fischer) provides us with a protagonist who we'd probably punch out in high school, but are forced to get behind in his scheme to win the heart of his teacher, played by Olivia Williams.  We soon find ourselves deciding that his goal might not be so ridiculous and is quite possibly, even enviable.Bill Murray (as Mr. Blume) gives the best performance of his career, toning down his naturally taciturn side and conveying the beaten ego of a washed up millionaire so perfectly that, like Max's character, we are not sure whether to chastise or embrace him.Ultimately, we embrace them both.A film that truly is as beautiful as the autumn leaves that seem to be falling in every shot, with a soundtrack that tells of more innocent days without become overly nostalgic, it carries a mature comedic tone subtle enough that at it's most inspired moments, we can only smile and let our laughter reflect inwardly as we try to figure out how to live in the world of Rushmore.9/10",

For those of you who don't speak Latin, this is what it means: Seize the day.  And that's what Rushmore's about.  It may be about rich snobs who will only settle for what they want, but in the end, it's about seizing the day.  Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) plays a kid who has a true passion: writing plays.  He may right plays that have certain elements that might not be appropriate for school (a bag of cocaine in Serpico) or things that might be nearly impossible to attempt (the gunfire and explosions in his Vietnam play) but he doesn't settle for \"It can't be done,\" he goes out there and does it.  Even if it means buying dynamite himself, he goes out there and does it.His seize the day attitude carries over into his love life also.  He falls in love with a teacher, and even though it's against school policy, and probably all moral values, he pursues her, just for the chance that she might say \"I love you\" back to him.  He convinces Bill Murray (who did a brilliant job in this film), who also loves her, to spend millions of dollars on something that might make her love either one of them.  It's a huge gamble, but Max's \"Won't Give Up\" attitude and charisma help him get whatever he wants.In the end, Rushmore is a definite rental, and probably a definite purchase (unless you really really hate it).  I can't wait to see what else Wes Anderson has up his sleeve.",

            "content": "Rushmore is not easily categorized. To call it a romantic comedy, which, superficially, it is, would be misleading. Rushmore is a parable about trying to find one's place in life. Max Fischer is convinced that Rushmore (the school) is his place in life, and he devotes his entire being into embodying and personifying the spirit of Rushmore through extracurricular activities. However, his devotion causes him to entirely ignore his academic responsibilities, placing his very existence teetering at the precipice of expulsion. Somehow, he manages to maintain a sort of unstable equilibrium, until he is struck by unrequited love for a young, beautiful, widowed, new teacher. Rushmore is the metaphor for a nirvana-on-earth sort of self-actualization. For Max, his Rushmore is no longer the school, but this new teacher, from whom his infatuations are not returned.The story is beautiful and each character is, at once, sweet, tragic, and heroic. Rushmore examines love, friendship, rivalry, jealousy, rejection, reconciliation, and forgiveness.Some have criticized Rushmore for its unrealistic story and characters. True, it is by no means a mainstream Hollywood movie, and the story occurs in a world which is just a few degrees outside of our spatial-temporal dimension. Nevertheless, the characters, in their hopes and faults and emotions, are more real than you'll find in almost any typical tinsel-town production.",

Also, the characters are incredibly well-developed and all easy to relate to in one way or another.(My personal favorite is Dirk Calloway, Max's chapel partner.)I think the best part is the plot of the old, stuffy business tycoon and the young, scheming, precocious youth battling it out for the love of the teacher:so atypical that it's simply wonderful.

When he's writing and directing, nothing holds him back. Every little detail that comes to mind, you better believe its going into the film. What I like most about his movies though, especially Rushmore, is the replay value, the ability to watch it again and get the same level of entertainment out of it. What's so neat about Rushmore is his little random scenes that may not have alot to do with the story, but help build character and such. One example is where Mr. Blume is drunk and walks up and does a cannonball off the diving board in his budweiser trunks. The way that the scenes jump on and off topic in the movie is just great. It's so fun to watch. The story that Anderson and Wilson created is probably one of my favorites. I don't know whether to call it a intelligent, witty, deep comedy or simply a coming of age story. I guess it's both. Regardless, if you haven't seen this movie, you're seriously missing out if you have yet to see it. Wes Anderson even puts the exactly right camera angles on people's faces during dialogue to get the best idea of the character. All the characters in his movies come so alive it's scary. Bill Murray shows his ability to play a somewhat dramatic role and still carry the witty humor to the screen which he is so highly regarded for. I can't find a single flaw in this movie. If you rent or buy the DVD, get the Criterion edition.If you only do one more thing for the rest of your life, see Rushmore. It's an entertaining, heartwarming, funny, mood-rising film about relationship.10/10.",

            "content": "After my first viewing of Rushmore, I was a little puzzled as to why I enjoyed it so much. I was wonder struck by the whimsical direction by Wes Anderson, the genuine and heartfelt performances by Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, and Olivia Williams, and the bizarre yet warm screenplay written by Wes and his college companion, Owen Wilson. However, after the credits rolled and \"Ooh La La\" by the Faces (the soundtrack also won me over) slowly faded out, my perception of why the film was so emotionally compelling was unclear.I watched Rushmore for the first time during the summer between my freshman and sophomore year. It was ideal timing, as the film opens with the protagonist, Max Fischer, entering his sophomore year at the esteemed Rushmore Academy. Max is a precocious, clever, somewhat of a wunderkind fifteen year old. However, as you find out in the opening of the film after his fantasy of \"solving the hardest geometry equation in the world,\" we learn that the Rushmore Yankee isn't the brightest student at the academy. In fact, the only reason he is able to keep attending Rushmore with his failing grades is because he joins almost every club Rushmore has to offer -- and in most cases, is the president, captain, or leader of a majority of those extracurricular activities.After analyzing Max, I began to recognize why \"Rushmore\" was so effective for me, to the point that I established it as my all time favorite movie. Max is the most identifiable character in any film that I have ever encountered in any of the films I have ever seen (even though I'm young, I've seen a lot of them). Max is an outcast, a social reject. He does poorly in math, has the gusto to write, produce and direct school plays (\"I WROTE A HIT PLAY!!!\"), and is, in some measure, a compulsive liar. He is a lot like me. This has become more true as I grow older and am placed into harder math classes. He dresses unlike his classmates (sporting a blazer with a Rushmore emblem, the only one in the crowd to don one), and talks with a pompous, almost pontifical vocabulary. One of his attributes that I most related with is his apprehension about the future. I have never identified better with a film character before I witnessed the fanciful world of Max Fischer.I know this review is more of an analysis of the main character, but I would only feel guilty to give more of the plot away of this terrific gem. I think even as I grow older, even older than Max himself, I will still look up to his high self esteem and exuberance to take on the impossible. In high school, it is easy to be without these characteristics. But only after repeated viewings of Rushmore, and learning lessons from my favorite movie character of all time, Max Fischer, I feel more and more as if I am watching a film that was written about me. I secure great comfort in knowing that, in the end, I will triumph just like Max.Rating: 10/10.",

His brother worked at a videostore and brought home the Rushmore screener, so luckily I got a chance to see it long before it was released on video.The first time I saw it I was amused at its quirks and catchy dialogue, but didn't think much more. After a second viewing I began to really catch the off the cuff almost 'inside' humour, and I laughed through the whole film. Now I make a point of it to watch the film at least once a month. Wes Anderson protrays each character in such an endearing matter, and almost reverses the roles of the children with the adults, making the kids address each other with manifestos and cordial invitations, and making the adults (mostly bloom), behave like teenagers.Bill Murrays role to say the least, is timeless, and Jason Schwartzmann performs beyond his mere 18 during filming. A Cameo by Luke Wilson proves Wes Anderson's knack to incorporate friends into each of his films, and scene changes of act one, two, three give the film a sincere and almost innocent flow. As though Anderson wrote the film in his highschool drama class.I feel Rushmore is comedy for the intelligent, as you really have to feel out the characters to truly appreciate the countless one liners and silly 'real life' scenerios. Rushmore is truly a classic and will surely achieve its cult status further in the years to come. And with a staggering musical selection to its credit, its soundtrack may just do the same.",

Same goes for music..all of that, everyone knows the same damn things cuz they are too lazy to figure something out on their own! aaah my rant is over. later.",

Jason Schwartzman does a magnificent job in his first feature film. Although it's 2015, this movie is never old. It's one of those flicks that really connect with anyone viewing. Bill Murray brings a stunning witty character on this film. Let's talk about the soundtrack. My favorite part in this picture is the scene where Max drops out of the public school he's forced into and I Am Waiting by the Rolling Stones plays over the montage. Mark Mothersbaugh composed a handful of songs in the film as well. I really love it, and i hope you will love it.",

Rushmore is quirky beyond most and its story is told with such an eye to detail that every viewing allows us a new experience. I saw this in the theater and laughed very hard. Later i purchased the VHS and watched it by myself. I cried all the way through hoping to meet people in real life like Max Fisher and Mr. Blume if only to show them this movie and to tell them to keep following their quirky dreams. I understand that I'm rambling so I'll get to the point. This movie is a multi-layered dark comedy that inspires. The characters are incredible and the visual style of Wes Anderson teamed up with the comedic writing of Owen Wilson has produced one of the best films of all time. Many years from now this movie will start popping up on all sorts of best of lists (already Martin Scorsese has named Wes Anderson as the next Martin Scorsese). It is my all time favorite movie so give it a look.",

            "content": "'Rushmore' is funny and quirky from the start. It is about an obsessive boy who attends an elitist school but is expelled due to his eccentric behaviour; however, he continues to pursue his love for his teacher with dramatic consequences.The main character, Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), is different to the other pupils at Rushmore. His dad is a barber, yet Max tells people he is a neurosurgeon. He appears to be ashamed of his family life. He wears a blazer and a tie out of choice and he throws all his energy in creating clubs for pupils to join. He is suffering from poor grades and these do not improve when his love blossoms. He befriends fellow outcast, Mr Blume (Bill Murray). Mr Blume finds that he connects with Max as they are both social misfits. He hates his life as a husband to a cheating wife and a father of two sons who he despises. They bond and plan to build an aquarium together. However, the pair find difficulty keeping their friendship civil when they both discover they are in love with first grade teacher, Miss Cross. Max decides to take revenge on Mr Blume with very drastic and hilarious measures but the retaliation is just as radical.Sometimes 'Rushmore' appears to have no clear direction but this is the beauty of the film. The audience is constantly surprised and enthralled by Max's outstanding character and Mr Blume's hilarious comic role. At Mr Blume's son's birthday party when he jumps into the pool with a cigarette in his mouth the music used aids in making the scene tragic but comic at the same time.Although the film is at times radical and unrealistic, it can be suggested that this is what makes the film so unique and interesting. However, it can also be quite tedious when taking into consideration that a middle age man is arguing with a fifteen year old boy.The character, Max, was an enjoyment to watch. Considering Jason Schwartzman was not actually an actor when he was picked for the role he portrayed the character successfully. Bill Murray was hilarious as Mr Blume and really added an edge to the film as the characters play off each other. Both characters were needed to really create this unique comedy.\nThis film is definitely worth seeing. It will have you laughing from beginning to end at both the plot and the characters. Even if the plot does not make it enjoyable, Bill Murray's character definitely will! I would give this film 4 out of 5, with its only downfall being a bit too radical.By Sophie Cupman",

            "content": "Rather under rated RushmoreI really enjoyed watching this twisted, unique, obsessive story of a matchless character. The excellent film 'Rush more' (directed by Wes Anderson), is so impressive due to the storyline.The film is set in an upper class private school which at first perception sets the scene for another scary teen, high school, heart break/ throb American Box office certainty.The stars in this film have a large influence on the effectiveness of its dark content in some important scenes. The Star of the film is Jason Schartzman who is not actually a well known actor but crucially has lead role in this film. He shines as a miss fit drummer, who is a small, geeky, quick definitive character whose personality contains obsessive and arrogant traits but also has a weird, creepy side shown in a line where he actually suggests the reason for a missing character is because of alien abduction.Any audience will be drawn to this actor because of his strong on screen presence and acting talents. I think that their will be a minority group within the intended audience of this film which will have things which they could relate deeply to this character, specifically much more than any of the other characters. This is why I think this character is such a success and is the main feature of this film. Schartzman, Character name 'Max Fischer' spends a lot of time organizing extra-curricular activities which affects his grades in a negative sense.The headmaster (Brian Cox) tells him to get his act together otherwise he will be kicked out, consequently he finds himself on \"sudden death academic probation\" - fail one more exam and he's gone. He then meets a millionaire Vietnam vet, called Mr Blume (Bill Murray- biggest Star in the film, who plays a strong important role), whose hateful twin sons are also at the school. This man is as disturbed as Max is obsessive. They become friends, until Max discovers that Blume is also infatuated with Miss Cox.\nThis film was directed, written and filmed in a very intellectual way. I feel there were no negative things about this film, I enjoyed it immensely, however it was a long movie, and at times I felt I was daydreaming and loosing attention. I think this was because I watched it so early in the morning!All the characters were very different from each other, which made it more entertaining to watch, also the viewers could relate to the different characters. The actors were all very believable and talented. I am not a big Bill Murray fan; however I enjoyed him in this movie, he suited his character and I found myself laughing at some of the stupid things he did. Some people might find this film slightly unrealistic and a bit over the top, for example, when Rushmore wants to build a fish tank for Miss Cox covering the football pitch of school property and takes it all on board not even asking permission.The ending is dramatic, stirring and completely unpredictable. This movie in my view is rated 4 out of 5 stars.  I hope I have teased you enough into going to see this must watch movie. It really is a must!\nBy Chloe Nauta",

            "review_title": "A change from the teen film norm",
            "content": "Warning the plot is discussed in this review but hopefully it won't spoil it for you.At a time when teen movies seem to be focusing on the superficial problems of teenagers Rushmore is a most refreshing change. With a small cast and with very few models in push up bras it plays on teenage insecurity, it also looks at the adult characters that have similar problems. Though not physically the ugly duckling story normally dealt with, Rushmore could be said to share the mental journey that is sometimes deeply hidden in the subtext of teen movies. Rushmore is the second collaborative work of Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson, more often known for his acting. Bottle rocket, their first film, Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums more recently, seem to be set in a strange world which seems dulled down at some points and at others it is a spectacle of colour, Max's plays for instance. The 60's style pop music used to underscore the film doesn't seem to quite fit in with the period of the film and although fun I found it intrusive at times. Jason Schwartzman plays Max Fischer, a teenage boy who won a scholarship to the prestigious Rushmore academy because of his playwriting skills. Rather than concentrating on his academic studies he prefers to take part in numerous extra curricular activities, particularly the drama group. His character seems to have an overwhelming sense of self- assurance and he manipulates teachers and friends for his own good. Indeed he is blas\u00e9 about the threat of expulsion saying to his chapel partner he'll 'pull some strings with administration'. Like modern counterparts in teen movies today he isn't really a bad guy and his reasons for manipulation don't appear to have any deeper purpose. His confidence is shaken when he falls for young teacher, Ms Cross, who of course rejects him but agrees they can be friends. Like most men Max seems to consider this playing hard to get. Herman also wishes to woo Ms Cross and there is bitter rivalry between the two suitors. Max's cringe worthy, advances towards Ms Cross make you want to slap him sometimes, but in the end I can relate and think Schwartzman is enjoyable to watch. I enjoy the way theatre curtains opening and closing are used to link the film to Max's plays and map the passage of time. Herman Blume's character was especially written with Bill Murray in mind and for me it's clear to see. As always he is enjoyable to watch and his character typically seems to be suffering from some sort of mid life crisis and finds it hard to interact with the opposite sex, his wife is cheating and his meetings with Ms Cross are awkward to say the least, but Murray still seems to maintain his sense of comedy despite these issues. Blume is a self made millionaire who hates his family. His isolation from them is obviously depicted through clever use of directorial techniques, particularly when he is sat at the bottom of the grubby looking pool.Rushmore is an enjoyable film which for me requires little effort to watch and although not strictly a laugh out loud romp is definitely a very funny film. This film is a must for people who want a change from the normal teen movie.",

            "content": "Rushmore\"I wish that I knew what I know now\".Two years after their misfired debut Bottle Rocket came the acclaimed Rushmore from the directing/writing duo, Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson. This coming-of-age comedy had me pondering why, like the lyric in the Faces (\"Ooh La La\") song, I had not seen, or heard, of this film sooner.Newcomer Jason Schwartman plays Max Fischer, the self-made pupil at the elite Rushmore Academy, to perfection. Fischer's exuberance for being president or founder of every extra-curricular activity, from the Calligraphy club to Drama Group, causes him to flunk academically leading to threats of expulsion from the place he adores: \"Rushmore is my life\". His unique friendship with Mr. Blume (Bill Murray), a discontent steel tycoon, is shaken when they both fall in love and childishly compete for Miss Cross, a first-grade teacher.Murray's ability to steal many scenes with ease, for example knocking a basketball out of a child's hand or running away from Miss Cross (Olivia Williams) after giving her a note from Max, aptly bring Herman Blume to life and delivers multiple levels of comedy to Rushmore. He excels as the self-loathing industrialist, ditching his renowned sarcasm for a more credible character based role that surely gains our sympathy. With no dialogue, Murray effortlessly conveys Blume's inner turmoil in just one small scene. Having seen his wife flirt with the tennis pro and his kids acting like brats, Herman jumps off the high diving board, wearing Budweiser shorts and a cigarette hanging out of his mouth. At the bottom of the pool the camera observes his detachment from his family and his loneliness as even a young boy swims away from him. Accompanied by a Kinks song, this scene highly exemplifies Murray's distinct talent as a flexible actor.Williams' character provides a sense of grounding to the film and genuinely comes across as innocent and someone still in love with the past and her dead husband. You'll just love when Max is quick to point out his mother died so they have something in common: \"So we both have dead people in our families\".Not only are the adult actors brilliant but also Schwartman gives a remarkable portrayal of Max, who could easily become annoying if played differently. You like Max even when he lies e.g. getting a hand job from his chapel partner's mother, and when he seems too obsessive. You sympathise with his character for not being like your run-of-the-mill adolescent and respect and laugh at him for his over-confident, optimistic approach to life. Also great performances by the supporting cast, especially Stephen McCole who provides many laughs as the uncouth Scot.Rushmore is full of unique but realistic characters and a superb, witty script with unforgettable scenes like the post-Serpico dinner e.g. Miss Cross brings a date (co-screenwriter's brother Luke Wilson) who explains his attire \"These are OR scrubs\" to which Max retorts \"O R they?\" Simple one-liners like this enrich the characters and the quirky undertone of Rushmore.The music - the Faces, the Who, Cat Stevens - is used effectively to aid rather than hinder the film's progression but also gives a sentimental, old-fashioned feel that reflects the mood and setting of the academy, the surrounding area and the film itself.Not a traditional happy ending but Rushmore's distinctive blend of adolescent romance and comedy will present plenty of laughs and if nothing else the nostalgic British soundtrack will invoke memories of being a teenager - painful as they may seem. Highly recommended.\nFour stars out of five.Dir. Wes AndersonApprox. Running Time: 89 minutesCraig Russell - submitted 05 May 2004",

            "content": "Rushmore is a fantastic coming of age comedy starring Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Olivia Williams and directed by Wes Anderson. It is an endearing tale of a private school boy, Max Fischer, played by Jason Schwartzman, who loves his school, Rushmore Academy. Max only got into Rushmore Academy because of his talents as a playwright rather than excelling at other academic studies. He heads almost all out of school activities from fencing to French, he dreams of being the perfect student but is far from this. In fact all these out of school activities are to the detriment of his grades, but it shows the perseverance of Max's character. When a new teacher arrives, Miss Cross, played by Olivia Williams, Max is immediately infatuated and sets upon impressing her by building the town an aquarium. To fund this aquarium Max enlists the help of local steel magnate Herman, the brilliant Bill Murray. When Herman falls for Miss Cross a hilarious love triangle ensues in which Max and Herman try to out do each other for the attention of Miss Cross.Miss Cross forms the moral centre to the story to which Max and Herman strive to achieve, their affections for her merely glossing over the problems in their own lives from which they run. Through the course of Rushmore we see Max eventually grow into a responsible young man. Bill Murray excels in one of the best performances of his career similar to his performance in recent film, Lost in Translation, he plays a man who is in mid-life crisis. Fed up of his boring job and predictable family life, Herman sees Max as the perfect son, rather than the troublesome twins he is the butt of every practical joke with. Murray plays this character in a typical dead-pan manner. Max runs away from his academic problems and creates a sort of double life, he pretends his dad is a brain surgeon, he is a hairdresser. Max then learns to tell the truth and be unashamed of his true life and heritage. He begins as an arrogant child but by the end of Rushmore becomes a more unassuming young man.Rushmore is a brilliant coming of age comedy which combines a funny story with a strong moral undertone, Schwartzman and Murray are excellent in their roles. Max and Herman both accept new lives and shed past preconceived notions of the perfect life. (*SPOILERS*)Adding to this a perfect Vietnam war play finale we can assume Max will finally settle on this as his sole out of school activity.Score: 8/10.",

            "content": "Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is a public school adolescent whose life is thrown into turmoil by his growing teenage emotions. He develops an obsession for a Rushmore teacher Mrs. Calloway, which leads to his ultimate expulsion from the school he loves so much. It also starts a comical feud between him and his good friend Herman Blume (Bill Murray), who starts an affair with Mrs. Calloway. The film reminds us all of the emotions we suffered during adolescence, such as jealousy, rejection and loneliness. These are taken to the extreme for comic purposes and amusingly these emotions are also experienced by the adults in the film and not just the teenagers, which is a frightening thought. The film focuses on the importance of friendship and the loneliness that being an outsider can bring. The majority of the characters have suffered a loss or are considered to be outcasts, all they have is each other. It will leave you appreciating the value of friendship and the danger of letting emotions such as jealousy or bitterness come between you and the people you love. This is by no means a film to be taken seriously but there are moments, such as when Max realises what his revenge has done to Herman that will make you think about how you treat those around you. The comic moments in the film are provided by Max and Herman whose strange antics are guaranteed to put a smirk on your face. There are, however, no real moments of hilarity that will bring tears to your eyes. You come away feeling that the comical situations the characters find themselves in have not been exploited to there full potential. It leaves you with a feeling that it could have been so much more. The quality of performance that Murray brings to the screen makes this a film worth watching alone. The lack of wit and sarcasm that is has been his trademark throughout the years means, however, that this is could never be a vintage Murray film. The site of him jumping of a diving board with a cigarette hanging from his mouth is one you can't help but smile at. The plot does tend to become tedious at times, with the characters constantly going around in circles, and the ending is predictable. It is, however, a quirky film that you can not help but like. If you get the chance to see Rushmore it is worth watching, but it is definitely not one you need to rush out and see. Not a classic but I would give it a 6/10 rating.",

            "content": "Rushmore is the humorous love triangle between quirky teenager Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzmann), graceful teacher Miss Cross (Olivia Williams) and lonely tycoon Mr. Blume (Bill Murray). Faced with exclusion and the pressure of maintaining an infinite array of outside interests, Max is a consistent under achiever who tips the scales of sanity when he becomes obsessed with Rushmore Academy's beautiful young teacher Miss Cross.In a bid to secure Miss Cross's love, Max intends to build a giant aquarium in her honour, with the help of his middle-aged millionaire friend Mr. Blume. However, the innocence and charm that Miss Cross exudes becomes too much for Blume to resist, and soon the testosterone levels reach fever pitch as man and boy desperately vie for her attention. What follows is an hilarious and often moving journey that takes us through the dreams, desires and vulnerabilities of each unique character.Director, Wes Anderson delivers a highly stylistic and colourful film, perfectly paced and complemented by a catchy classic soundtrack that makes for pleasant viewing. Rushmore is very much a film that subtly achieves its aims; in one breath it is funny or sad, in another it can be dark and sinister; particularly with regards to Max's advances to Miss Cross and Andersons' depiction of teenage angst.A well-placed cast provide excellent performances that bring Anderson's creation to life. The characters are warm and intriguing; blending and contrasting perfectly on screen to produce an eccentric and engaging chemistry. The unique and larger than life characters such as Mr. Blume (Murray) and Max Fischer (Schwartzmann) are played with such compassion that you genuinely care for them, despite their obvious imperfections. Murray's depiction of the lonely Mr. Blume is particularly poignant at times, whilst Schwartzmann's energetic performance as Fischer shifts from menacing to affectionate in a heartbeat. Rushmore also sports an assortment of hilarious and interesting characters that aid the films gentle pace, Stephen McCole's humorous addition to the cast with his portrayal of Magnus Buchan, the angry Scot whose talent with swear words is worthy of an Oscar, is one such example.\nIf you like film with depth as opposed to effects, and you remember the moment you discovered your hormones, then Rushmore is the film for you. Rushmore moves from a light-hearted romantic comedy to a darker more complex narrative effortlessly. Overall, it's an absorbing, witty piece that stands alone from the mainstream manufactured Hollywood narratives, delivering a satisfying and pleasurable movie experience.Rating 5 stars",

            "content": "Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson together create this wild, adventurous, and funny romantic comedy. Set in the summer at Rushmore elementary school, Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is a 15 year old school boy whose school life is surrounded by his profound enjoyment of being involved with every extra curricular activity. Max begins to fall for a teacher at the school, Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). Max's friend Herman Blume (Bill Murray), a father of boys who attend Rushmore, also falls for Rosemary and this film explores their journey of friendship and betrayal with obstacles along the way and a funny battle to win the affection of Rosemary.Rushmore is a rather erratic film with a storyline that can make you laugh, but more at the film and not within the film itself. Set at the school that Max attends and Rosemary is a teacher, a soundtrack from the 1960's British invasion and hilarious plays written my max and over-exaggerated sound effects this film could be one to watch.Schwartzman plays a brilliant role of Max, the rather ambitious school boy falling in love with someone out of his league. Although not one of the most popular boys in school, his character is adventurous, smart and a bit on the clumsy side. This character is over-the-top and out of this world and disliked by the head of the school, there is no one who can live up to his reputation. One of the best bits of this film is Max's plays which use a lot of sound effects and excessive lighting but bring laughter to the film because of these.Murray's strong character as Herman Blume, a steel tycoon with a failing marriage, and nothing to look forward to in his life, in other words he's in a mid-life crisis, until Max befriends him. Murray's character is like someone's whole life in the life of Herman. Murray plays a brilliant role of a lonesome father whose life is falling apart. Until he meets Rosemary, the woman his friend max has fallen for.Murray and Schwartzman together heighten the atmosphere in this film and make it worth watching if you like a film that's full of outrageous characters and fun-filled action characters although some might find the film a little over exaggerated and irritating. This film is aimed at more of a younger audience, but if you fancy watching it then I recommend it.Rating: 3/5",

But his destiny to become the next Charles Foster Kane is compromise by a little thing...Max is a lousy student and when the headmaster, doctor Guggenheim (Brian Cox) put him on sudden death probation, his all life is about to change. He falls in love with a first grade teacher (Olivia Williams) and try everything to get her attention and his friendship with another outcast, Mr Blume (Bill Murray) a steel Tycoon, who hates his life of misled husband and his children, is about to change when Blume also falls in love with Mrs Cross, at this very moment, War is declared.Rushmore is probably one of the most funniest and original comedy I have seen, it's darkly, subtly humour is highly effective, it's dark humour can be compare to others movie of the Anderson/Wilson duo (the Royal Tenenbaums), you never expect what's going on! For his sons birthday Blume jump on the swimming pool with his cigarette and stay on the bottom where he winds up hiding from life on a Mick Jagger song `I am waiting'. The beauty of the film is that you are not able most of times to know when a sequence is tragic or funny and the music helps in this way.The war of nerves between Max and Blume is highly funny but does not seem that realistic all the time.One of the surprise of this movie is the depth of each characters, that melt with an original and smash story made Rushmore unique and the others us comedy compared to it in those terms will be relatively short in length. The actors gave terrific performance, it is not possible to avoid the comparison between Jason Schwartzman and Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) in the Graduate, but the best performance comes from Bill Murray in his portrayed of the social outcast Blume, probably his best part since Mad Dog and Glory.To make it short...see it, it's definitely worth it, the characters and the story will make u laugh until the end.",

            "content": "Rushmore (directed by Wes Anderson)Rushmore is a romantic teen comedy which is written by the collaboration of Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson the star of `Zoolander' and `Starsky and Hutch.' Wes Anderson himself has directed two other comic movies that are very funny they are `Bottle Rocket' and `The Royal Tenenbaums.' The plot revolves around a young adolescent teenage called Max Fisher (Jason Schwartzman) who constantly ignores the real reason why he is at school, and instead takes it upon himself to engage with outside curricular activities like that of being the head of the beekeeping club, and the founder of the fencing club and so on and so fourth. This intense focus upon the unessential in life threatens his future at Rushmore Academy, which could result in his expulsion by the headmaster Dr Guggenheim played by (Brian Cox). But before this happens Max accidentally comes across a 1st Year teacher Miss Cross (Olivia Williams) who he becomes obsessed and falls in love with. One of Max's friends Mr Blume played by (Bill Murray) has also seen Miss Cross and he to falls for her in the same way, resulting in a wonderfully hilarious fight between the two to win her affections. All of the performances within the film were solid and well cast. There was a surprising depth to each character involved, for instance Bill Murray's character was not so much a main character but he was able to express the character's emotions exceptionally well. One of the best scenes was during the pool party where Mr Blume is acting like a bum throwing golf balls aimlessly into the water whilst smoking a cigarette, he then goes across to the diving pool and dives in half heartedly. Bill Murray is able to draw out a character's deepest depressive emotions with comic genius reminiscent within `Groundhog Day' and `Scrooge'. Jason Schwartzman gives a strong bold performance as Max Fisher he is able to pull off with ease a difficult role to do. The comedy is of a very dry wit, but not dark. It is very different to many of those gross out teenage comedies like American Pie, and Road Trip. For this reason it breathes a new freshness to the teenage comedy genre. But it does air a comparison to the film `The Graduate' where the student falls for an older woman Mrs Robinson.  A really great film that just doesn't tire and is able to keep the comedy flowing nicely right up to the end credits. This film just goes to show that you don't need computer generated special effects to make a great film. I really recommend this film to anybody. 5/5",

            "content": "Wes Anderson's 1998 film is a story of love in the main. Max Fischer is a student at the private school of Rushmore, where he is failing with bad grades, and is more interested in plays and all sorts of extra curricular activities. He falls in love with a pre-school teacher, Ms Cross, but the love is unrequited, but he continues his pursuing of her. He has quite a strange mixture of friends, Dirk Calloway, a fellow student at the school, failing millionaire tycoon, Hernan Blume and Ms Cross.It follows the life of Fischer, and the ins and outs of what he gets up to. Mostly, this involves all of the societies and activities he is part of, or planning to do. Most of this seems to revolve around love in some way, and is always trying to impress Ms Cross, in some ways, it is a slightly unreal storyline as he is a fifteen-year-old boy and she is a teacher within Rushmore. The more realistic part to this storyline is the love link between Ms Cross and Blume, which Fischer does not like as both of them are his friends and he is in love with Cross.Jason Schwartzmann fits into the character of Fischer well and is refreshing in the role as it is not your typical teen movie, or your typical role for a teenager. It does not have a large cast with many big names in it, although, Bill Murray who plays the role of Blume fits in perfectly and the character seems to have been made for him. Fischer becomes somewhat obsessed with Cross, and tries too hard at making everything perfect for himself, this is partly why he gets expelled from Rushmore, and has to start a new life at a state school. When Blume also starts to fall for Cross, things go from bad to worse for Fischer and tries to get revenge on Blume, and somewhat predictably, everything works out just fine for Fischer. This is a well-directed film with a good storyline, which has its funny moments; none in particular are hilarious but some will bring a smile to your face. Overall, this was enjoyable to watch, but the plot was sometimes a little erratic with no clear direction, however, it is worth seeing for Murray's portrayal of Blume and the few comic moments within it. Although the ending is predictable, the storyline as a whole is free flowing and easy to understand.",

Herman is the empty, tired adult inside all of us who knows he's achieved everything and has nothing.

            "content": "Rushmore is my second favorite comedy of all time, and is extremely funny. Max Vischer, as a character and an idea, is incredible. A boy who is extremely active in every extra-curricular activity (other than serious sports) that a school could offer, including many that he himself founded. He loves attending Rushmore Academy, though he is flunking out of school. He is a genius, but socially tactless and extremely quirky.I am somewhat glad that not everyone can appreciate this style of humor. Wes Anderson's movies, to me, are magic. The style is ridiculous and bizarre, yet holds together themes and real, flaw-filled characters. His films are hilarious and warm.So, if you like smart-yet-crazy-funny movies (aka Chris Guest films, Napoleon Dynamite, etc.), this film is a must-see. If you saw Terminator 3 in the theater, this probably won't be your bag.This movie is amazing and magical.",

            "content": "When I first saw this film almost a year ago I was amazed. I was immediately entranced with the main character, Max Fischer, and the movie itself but I just couldn't tell exactly why. I watched it several more times that week and was able to place it. Max speaks like an adult with a teenager's sensibility and judgment. He is completely endearing and wonderful as a character. I'm convinced that no one could have played him better than Jason Schwartzman does.This is not to say that he is the only character that stands out. He is just the one that does so the most. Bill Murray as Mr. Herman Blume is absolutely hysterical. He just plays the part so well, making you believe a man of his age could be friends with a boy of Max's age. Olivia Williams as Ms. Cross adds a certain sensibility and kindness to the role at the beginning but is able to be as harsh as she needs to be later on. I could talk about all of the actors and what wonderful jobs they did but let's just say they all did great and move on (excluding the twins who played Ronnie and Donnie, they acted poorly, but it worked for their characters).The next thing you have to take into account for this movie is the soundtrack. It is absolutely astounding. It captures every moment in the movie perfectly. The songs licensed for the movie were obviously chosen carefully. The score that was recorded for the movie is phenomenal. It's quirky and different and fits the mood like a glove.The last thing I want to talk about is Wes Anderson. Here he proves himself as an excellent filmmaker. This screenplay he produced, with the help of Owen Wilson, is excellent. This movie is infinitely quotable. Not to mention his work as a director. This movie is superb on every level. I guess the only thing left to talk about is the cinematography. It's nothing new or inventive but there are no useless, ugly, or misplaced shots. Some of the shots are quite nice actually.With it's clever wit, loads of heart, and comedic timing this movie is immediately endearing. However, I have found that for some it takes repeat viewings to understand the glory of this film. So if you didn't like it the first time, please I implore you, try it again. One last note, anyone who only cares for normal Hollywood big-budget fodder need not apply. This is more of a thinking man's movie. 10 out of 10.",

If someone asks me what was that movie about, I don't know what to tell them. The pace of the story was too slow for me which I think goes back to the fact that there was really nothing to the story to be narrated. I like the feeling and the vibe of Wes Anderson's movies in general and I don't mind them not having a strict and tight plot that follow a typical storyline arch including beginning, middle, and an end, as long as there's a underlying theme that help the viewers connect the dots. Unfortunately, Rushmore lacked that. I should probably say that I am a big Wes Anderson fan and after seeing some of his more recent films, I decided to go back and watch all his movies in the order they were made to study his evolution as a director. I probably I had very high expectations.",

The cast is perfect and I can just make 1000 compliments to Bill Murray; well he is really a good actor, really convincing and extremely funny.The story is very emotional but in some way exaggerated too but I think \"exageration\" is typical by Wes Anderson especially the way he develops characters, their decisions and reactions. Max Fisher is \"exagerated\" in everything he does, in good and bad things too. He is maybe a loser (just like the former genius-kids in The Tennenbaums) but he still has the chance to become someone. I loved the soundtrack very much too.It has that retro-style which gives a sort of dream-like effect to the movie, because it seems to be set in a temporal limbo, where time is not so important.",

I can imagine Bill Murray's performance being divisive for some. The laughs that he produces could be chalked up to Anderson and Owen Wilson on the script because he appears restrained and a bit inanimate throughout. I think that it is key for his character to have vibrancy around, and that Murray's restraint or woodenness never impedes Rushmore's glorious, whimsical thrill ride. Olivia Williams also does really well, and shouldn't be forgotten in her role as an instructor attracting the attention of Schwartzman's Max almost from the beginning. I enjoy Rushmore most for its departure from convention and refusal to allow good nature to bury creativity. Most of the film is beautifully shot in its own right without being distracting, and I found this one to be a bit of a hidden surprise that isn't talked about enough.",

It also marks Schwartzman's first film, who plays Max Fischer, the lower-middle class student at a prestigious private school who compensates his status by joining and championing various clubs, sports teams, and educational groups, all to the detriment of his GPA. We all knew a Max Fischer, which is what makes him appealing, annoying, and even detestable at times. However, you can't help but root for the schmuck, even if it isn't for the ridiculous goal of scoring with the First-Grade teacher, Rosemary (Olivia Williams). I was pleasantly surprised with how good Bill Murray, as wealthy businessman and Rushmore graduate, Herman Blume, was in the film, as I likely hadn't viewed it since the early 2000s. He has a handful of great lines, which typed out wouldn't give them justice, and also swats a child's jump-shot \u2014 just good stuff. Wrapped together with an excellent soundtrack of \"British Invasion\" rock, Rushmore toes-the-line as a \"must-watch\".",

The film is also supported by a fantastic soundtrack that fits perfectly with the story line, all the quirky twists and turns. Great cast, great story / writing, and directing.

I didn't find this film really memorable, as I considered the jokes very dumb and the plot not being entertaining enough like all of his other movies. Whereas not comparing this film to other of Wes Anderson's -- it's a fine picture. Great style and color with amazing actors deliver a fantastic performance and aesthetic feeling. This film is very edgy and basically creates an unreal situation that everybody would like to be in. This movie is worth your time watching if you watch films for their views and feeling, although I do not believe that there is a good enough climax or comedy part in it. A 7/10.",

As a coming-of-age story whose actual objective narrative is essentially completely unrelatable to anyone, the film relies predominantly on mood and emotion to convey a sense of empathy. While not as immediately 'fun' as some of Anderson's more recent works (the later addition of his characteristic narration, for instance), Rushmore is still a worthy addition to the director's output.

It doesn\u2019t matter how different the plots are, how diverse the characters are, or even if it\u2019s live action or animated...they all share the exact same tone. It\u2019s so pronounced that I swear you could shuffle scenes from all his movies together and it would take a long while before you would notice something was wrong. If you\u2019re a big fan of the Wes Anderson aesthetic, then I imagine none of this bothers you, and Rushmore is one more wonderful treat. However, I\u2019m not that enamored with it, and therefore I get somewhat bored with most of his movies (when I\u2019m not actively annoyed by them.) I\u2019ve said before that the style of his films make them feel like they were made by an alien who is trying to imitate their perception of life on Earth. It has the bones of a human story, but no one acts normal, and there are oddities in the way the movie world functions that don\u2019t quite line up with reality. Of course his movies look amazing, because Wes Anderson is all about painstakingly working out the details, but they lack humanity. Rushmore is more of the same, and doesn\u2019t bring anything new or interesting for me to enjoy. Thankfully, it\u2019s not one of the Wes Anderson movies that frustrates me, because most of the characters are pleasant enough and the plot is harmless. There are certainly moments where I find Jason Schwartzman to be irritating, but the story is presenting him in a negative fashion in those scenes, so that\u2019s acceptable. Bill Murray doesn\u2019t get enough to do in order to save the film. He has some moments of comedy that work, but this is more Schwartzman\u2019s movie. Rushmore is such a strange film because it never seems clear whether the main character is a good student or a bad one, all we know is he\u2019s overly ambitious and likes to organize extracurricular activities. When we see him getting a C- I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s good for him or terrible. I\u2019m also a bit puzzled by how he has avoided constant bullying since he is such a tedious know-it-all. As with many other Wes Anderson movies, I find Rushmore to be an acceptable way to pass the time and nothing more. It\u2019s certainly not a movie I\u2019d ever need to revisit since I\u2019ve seen plenty of his films before, and can get the same experience from any of them.",

He's a divisive filmmaker and it doesn't seem like there's much middle ground between those who love him and those who loathe him. Count me in the former camp. For what it's worth, Rushmore is probably Anderson at his most accessible. All the hallmarks are here - the cast is thoroughly quirky, the cinematography obsessively detail-focused, the soundtrack firmly planted in lyrically-appropriate 60s and 70s rock - but it's all somewhat toned down from his usual level; less in-your-face, take-it-or-leave-it.\n\nThe film's subject, an insular private school and the odd, hyper-focused youths who proudly call it home, lends itself to such idiosyncrasies. Here we find all manner of brilliant young minds, developed well past their years in some respects but stunted in many others. That essential duality is interesting, amusing, understandable. They've been taught to solve for x and y, to adapt mature films for the stage (example: Serpico for kids), but remain remedial students of human interaction.\n\nMax, the focus of this personality-driven black comedy, is a perfect exhibit. At fifteen, it looks like his best days are already behind him and he struggles to compensate with a flood of strangely specific extracurriculars and, later, a sadly misguided reach for forbidden fruit: a smart, attractive, widowed first-grade teacher. He's accompanied by a colorful fabric of supporting characters. Plenty of amusingly unbalanced students, sure, but also a curious batch of equally dysfunctional adults. Bill Murray works magic with one of these roles, a tough mix of frustrated parent, self-loathing businessman, unexpected mentor and hopeful suitor. He and Jason Schwartzman (Max) share instant chemistry and the film wisely sticks them together like glue, even when their characters are at each other's throats.\n\nIn all, Rushmore is a well-tuned, somewhat downplayed, dose of the Anderson style: funny, driven, melancholy and genuine. His films might not speak to everyone, but they usually hit the mark for me. This is one of the best.",

The only certain thing for me is that this is still the best of his filmography, even after more than 20 years from its released.\n\nThis film premiered in December 1998, so of course is not the same make a review nowadays  than then, this movie has become a classic for the director's fans and a favorite between the followers of this stylish comedy-drama movies. I can see today that in Rrushmore we find an entrance to Wes's World, a guide to his unique style and the beginning of a legacy.\n\nThe plot is about Max Fischer (preformed by Jason Schwartzman) an eccentric 15 year-old student of Rushmore Academy, an elite private school, in which he is one of the worst students due to his attention being more focus in extra-curricular activities than in the real subjects. He dreams with being a genius or someone special, and tries to show himself like one. As the story goes on we see how his behaviour makes him go through encouraging and difficult situations, sharing the screen with characters like Rosemary Cross, a teacher with whom Fischer develops an obsession; and Herman Blume, a disillusioned industrialist played by the legendary Bill Murray in one of his best roles. \n\nAll the characters in the movie have an important role, none of them is too bad or too good, neither too funny or too serious and that is what I found brilliant in this screenplay written by Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson, every one of them have some line or situation that will be remember when the picture is over.\n\nYou may think this is only a characters driven story but is more than that, every frame works as a whole with that beautiful cinematography by Anderson's frequent collaborator Robert Yeoman, and that soft but interesting music composed by Mark Mothersbaugh. The formula give us a perfect result, funny, original, clever and lovely; I cannot wait to see this film again. 10/10",

            "content": "A delightful comedy of rare perspective.\n\nWes Anderson's indie coming of age comedy Rushmore (1998) is pure joy as Anderson's quirky style and riveting direction make you feel the warmth of friendship and love all over again. Anderson directs Rushmore with his usual sleek, symmetrical style and uplifting tone. Rushmore demonstrates how Wes has matured as a director since Bottle Rocket into a slickly creative auteur of refined sensibilities.  Rushmore delivers constant laughter, but I most appreciate the heartfelt character arcs and genuine empathy for his unique roles.Rushmore is a meticulously crafted art piece, but lovingly written with Wes Anderson's original vision.\n\nWes Anderson and Owen Wilson's script is remarkable as they create this horribly precocious and unlikable hero, make him sympathetic, then give him redemption in a very real and reflective way showing that people can change. All fluff transforms into sincere character interactions that make you feel like everything will alright. I love how Anderson forms these bonds between people that ensures humanity has more to offer than cynicism. \n\nDavid Moritz' snappy editing keeps Rushmore's brief 93 minutes a blissful viewing experience. Robert D. Yeoman's cinematography is very naturalistic as to his backdrops of schoolyards and graveyards, but it's his cute square framing of every shot that keeps you smiling. Quick shots scattered everywhere work wonders as brief friendly visuals attract your eyes all over Rushmore. Mark Mothersbaugh's score is again neat indie rock, folk rock, and alternative rock like his sweet music for Bottle Rocket. His sound fits the adorable aesthetic of Wes Anderson's films aptly.\n\nI must say how much I like Karen Patch's costumes for Rushmore. She straight up dresses Jason Schwartzman like Wes Anderson himself and everyone else is in colorful, cute outfits that keep Rushmore a bright movie. She did a great job with all these neat threaded suit jackets.\n\nJason Schwartzman is incredible for such a young actor as the odd and too attached, near sociopathic, student Max Fischer. He's awkward with no understanding of normal social cues, so he's certainly a quirky Wes Anderson character. However, all his creepy, commanding, and forceful stalker behavior gets redeemed because Max is not a bad person, but a foolish kid. Schwartzman is so funny as Rushmore's lead, but also endearing as a young man looking for his place and purpose in the world. How can you not relate to a boy trying to find a girl to fall in love with really?\n\nBill Murray is hilarious as Max's older friend Mr. Herman Blume. His dejected state is funny to observe as Murray makes it clear his marriage is over, he hates his destructive sons, and doesn't relate to the world anymore despite all his wealth and luxury. He's a great foil and friend for Jason Schwartzman to act opposite. I also liked the child actor Mason Gamble as Max's young friend Dirk Calloway. Can you believe Wes Anderson got Connie Nielsen to cameo as Dirk's lovely mother?\n\nI adore Olivia Williams in Rushmore as the object of Max's desire named Miss Rosemary Cross. She's a strong character mourning her dead husband, looking for love, but uneasy at her new prospects. Williams is phenomenal in the confrontation scene with Schwartzman in the classroom. She's mesmerizing as you sympathize with all the trouble Max brings her, but Olivia Williams gets you to empathize with her depressed lady. Likewise, Sara Tanaka is excellent as the adorable Margaret Yang. She plays the nice nerdy love interest that fits Max's outlandish personality perfectly! I wish Wes gave her even more lines. She's that good.\n\nSeymour Cassel is wonderful as Max's kind barber father Bert Fischer. Brian Cox kills it as Max's frustrated principal Dr. Nelson Guggenheim. He endears you to his tough and angry supervisor figure in that gruff, yet likable fashion that Cox thrusts into existence for all his roles. Stephen McCole is hilarious as the defiant Scottish bully Magnus Buchan. \n\nNow for all the other cameos in Rushmore. Alexis Bledel apparently cameos as a student somewhere in Rushmore. I like Luke Wilson's carefree cameo as Dr. Peter Flynn. Andrew Wilson cameos as the disappointed Coach Beck. Dipak Pallana gets a return cameo after he got robbed in Bottle Rocket as Max's math teacher in Rushmore Mr. Adams. Kumar Pallana is back after committing the robbery in Bottle Rocket, now a landscaper named Kumar Littlejeans in Rushmore. It's so cute how Wes Anderson keeps casting all his favorite friends and great actors in little roles for his feature films. \n\nIn all, Rushmore is a remarkable picture full of hopeful optimism and playful maturity from the masterful movie maker Wes Anderson.",

Mature, clever and, at times, profoundly funny, it shows a somewhat convoluted picture of how men, young and old alike, can go quite crazy out of love and jealousy.

            "content": "Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), an eccentric 15-year-old, is a scholarship student at Rushmore Academy, a private school in Houston. He is both Rushmore's most extracurricularly active and least scholarly student. He spends nearly all of his time on elaborate extracurricular activities, dramatically affecting his grades. He also has a feud with the school's headmaster, Dr. Guggenheim. At a school assembly, Max meets Herman Blume (Bill Murray), a disillusioned industrialist who finds his operation of a multimillion-dollar company to be tedious. He is upset that his marriage is failing and the two sons he's putting through Rushmore are impolite and obnoxious brats spoiled by their mother. Herman comes to like Max, and the two become good friends. Max is impressed by Herman's success, while Herman is interested in Max's confident persona. Max also develops an obsession with Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams), a widowed teacher who arrives at Rushmore as a new first grade instructor. She joined Rushmore after the death of her husband, who was a former student. While she initially tolerates Max and his attempts to pursue her, Rosemary becomes increasingly worried by his obvious infatuation. Along the way, Blume attempts to convince Max that Rosemary is not worth the trouble, only to fall for Rosemary himself. The two begin dating without Max's knowledge...\n\nThe film helped launch the careers of Anderson and Schwartzman while establishing a \"second career\" for Murray as a respected actor in independent cinema. At the 1999 Independent Spirit Awards, Anderson won Best Director award and Murray won Best Supporting Male award. Murray also earned a nomination for Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture. \"Rushmore\" is considered one of Anderson's finest works and was ranked one of the best films of the 1990s by several publications. In 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"This cult favorite is a quirky coming of age story, with fine, off-kilter performances from Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray.\" In his review for the Daily News, film critic Dave Kehr praised Rushmore as \"a magnificent work: the best and most beautiful movie of 1998\". USA Today gave the film three out of four stars and wrote that Bill Murray was \"at his off-kilter best\". Todd McCarthy, in his review for Variety, wrote, \"The deep-focus widescreen compositions possess an unusual clarity that adds details and endows the action and humor with exceptional vividness\". In his review for Time, Richard Schickel praised Rushmore as \"an often deft, frequently droll little movie turns into an increasingly desperate juggling act, first trying to keep too many dark and weighty emotional objects aloft, then trying to bring them back to hand in a graceful and satisfying way\". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, \"It's a particular treat for its skewed, hilarious memories of a cutthroat boyhood\". In his review for The Independent, Anthony Quinn said of Schwartzman that \"he perfectly captures the poignancy of a character who understands his failings but hasn't yet the emotional resources to conquer them\". In her review for The Washington Post, Rita Kempley praised Schwartzman's performance for winning \"sympathy and a great deal of affection for Max, never mind that he could grow into Sidney Blumenthal\". Entertainment Weekly gave Rushmore an \"A\" rating and wrote, \"Anderson concentrates on beautifully disciplined filmmaking, employing 1960s British Invasion hits . . . to further define Max's adolescent dislocation\". Jonathan Rosenbaum, in his review for the Chicago Reader, wrote, \"To their credit, Anderson and Wilson share none of the class snobbery that subtly infuses much of Salinger's work ... But like Salinger they harbor a protective gallantry toward their characters that becomes the film's greatest strength and its greatest weakness\". In Time Out New York, Andrew Johnston wrote: \"A breezy comedy about the grey area between adolescence and adulthood, Rushmore makes good on the promise of Wes Anderson's Bottle Rocket - and then some. Thanks to stellar performances and the director's original comic vision, it's easily one of the year's finest films. ... Rushmore is somewhat indebted to Harold and Maude and similar comedies of that era, but the complexity of Max and the audacity of the film's set pieces place it in a league of its own.\" However, some critics did not review the film so positively. In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan criticized Max's overtly \"snooty\" personality as \"too off-putting to tolerate\" which could potentially discourage audiences when identifying with the film. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four citing an issue with the film's shift in tone in the final act, stating \"the air goes out of the movie\" in regards to \"stage-setting and character development\". He further wrote, \"Anderson and Wilson are good offbeat filmmakers ... But their film seems torn between conflicting possibilities: it's structured like a comedy, but there are undertones of darker themes, and I almost wish they'd allowed the plot to lead them into those shadows\". A lifelong fan of film critic Pauline Kael, Anderson arranged a private screening of Rushmore for the retired writer. Afterwards, she told him, \"I genuinely don't know what to make of this movie\". It was a nerve-wracking experience for Anderson but Kael did like the film and told others to see it. Anderson and Jason Schwartzman traveled from Los Angeles to New York City and back on a touring bus to promote the film. The tour started on January 21, 1999 and went through 11 cities in the United States.\n\nWes Anderson\u00b4s coming of age film \"Rushmore\" with the young/old misfit Max as the lead character is slowpaced, indie quirky and a bit too much Anderson to be honest in my eyes. The character oddness move along in some sort of slapstick universe that is not really funny, but more weird/strange with Anderson trying to create something different from a normal narrative and character development. I will give him credit for that. We get great performances from Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and lovely Olivia Williams, but the fact remains that the main character Max is an obnoxious little know it all, who is hard to like or for that matter hard to cheer for. And even if Anderson wants to be indie quirky he still falls in many stereotypical holes in his storyline. \"Rushmore\" is ok, but not Wes Anderson\u00b4s best work if you ask me.",

            "content": "Quirky, offbeat, and clever; everything we like about director Wes Anderson.  We really don't know what's going to happen as the story plays out, in part because of how unique the characters are, and in part because the film plays as fantasy.  Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), a teenage boy at Rushmore Academy, acts as though he's a worldly middle-aged man, pursuing an improbably large number of extracurricular activities, writing plays, and not caring all that much about his studies.  Herman Blume (Bill Murray), a wealthy businessman dissatisfied with his wife's adultery and his two boorish sons, is drawn to Max, and befriends him.  However, when the two of them begin vying for the same woman (Olivia Williams), a rivalry develops.  \n\nWhat's fascinating about the film is the interplay of these two characters.  Blume begins acting in all sorts of juvenile ways, which is an interesting mirror to how precocious Max is.  The disillusionment Blume is going through, hammered home with a scene at his dingy, suburban pool where he does a cannonball after downing his whiskey and then stays underwater as it to escape from it all, is similar to the angst we might associate with an adolescent.  The breadth of Max's interests, his higher-level thinking about the important things in life, his audacious schemes, and the confidence he exudes pursuing a romance with a teacher or breezing down the hallway in his blazer, is like a powerful movie mogul (or adolescent dream).  Anderson gives us a humanizing bridge here between people at the age of 15 and 50.\n\nMixed in to all of this are lots of little moments that are funny or touching.  I loved the message that's delivered in a subtle way amidst the fun of the film.  Dream big, it seems to tell us; be brave, and don't be afraid to be different.  Following the conventional path may lead to outward success, but unhappiness.  It's telling to me that Max's father, a humble barber, is the most content character of all.  I think the love triangle went on a little longer than it should have, and it would have been nice to see more of Margaret Yang (Sara Tanaka), but it was nice that the film never fell into predictability.  Very entertaining.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson films are some of the most beautiful, enjoyable ever put on camera.  It's undeniable when you see an Anderson film.  \"Rushmore\" opened the doors for Anderson with the critics, and it is a great film.  The only problems are that it's a bit uneven.  It tells the coming of age story of Max Fischer through roughly four to five months.  His loves, his triumphs, his failures.\nThe film opens with the math teacher being asked about a math question so impossible that if any one of his students were to solve it, they will never have to open another math book for the rest of their lives.  The teacher asks Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) to take a crack at it, he puts down his newspaper and walks up to the board and gets it right to tremendous applause by his classmates only to wake up.  This sets the audience up to believe he is one of the most intelligent kids at the prep school Rushmore only to find out that he is one of the worst students at the school.  He is at risk of being expelled.\nMax may be one of the worst students but he finds a lot of time for extracurricular studies as either presidents or founder.  His ambition far exceeds his actual intelligence.  He is only fifteen and comes from a modest background.  His father is a barber and his mother is dead.  He got a academic scholarship to the school for writing a play when he was 7.  He impresses everyone he meets, including the father of his classmates named Herman Bluthe (Bill Murray).  Blume and Max become friends.\nMax also meets new teacher Rosemary Cross, a widower whose husband went to Rushmore years ago before meeting her.  Max develops a crush on her and soon, so does Bluthe.  The two then fight for her affection before Max is kicked out of school and she dumps Bluthe.  The rest of the film involves Max making up with Bluthe and trying to win her back for him while trying to make public school a little more like Rushmore.\nSeymour Cassel plays Bert Fischer, Max's loving father who is such an absolutely wonderful man that it's a shame he wasn't in the film more.  He supports his son through every endeavor and imagines huge things for him.  Even when Max drops out of school and starts to apprentice with his Dad, Bert still wants the best, but on Max's terms.  He may be overwhelmed raising a kid on his own, but he is such a great guy.\nThis film works not only as a great introduction to Anderson's style, but the starting point for the Bill Murray/indie relationship that would eventually land him his only Oscar nomination to date.",

            "content": "With Rushmore, writer/director Wes Anderson beelines it out of Wes Andersonville toward a place that resembles the world you and I inhabit. In Wes Andersonville, individuals are quirky beyond recognition-sometimes overwritten into oblivion. Rushmore's lead character, Max Fischer, is a proud citizen of Wes Andersonville, but unlike the director's other films, this one features a lead character forced to assimilate with normal people. The results are pretty fantastic.\n\nThe film's title refers to the elite private school Fischer (Jason Schwartzman, in his film debut) attends. Rushmore is the most important thing in the world to Max, and as such, he shirks his studies in favor of extracurriculars like the Stamp & Coin Club, Calligraphy Club, Astronomy Society, Fencing Team, and the Rushmore Beekeepers. He also writes, directs, and stars in intricate stage plays.\n\nHis grades, however, are truly unacceptable considering he's attending Rushmore on full scholarship. Rushmore's headmaster, Dr. Guggenheim (Brian Cox), informs him he's on \"sudden death academic probation.\" In other words, if he fails one more test, he's out. This doesn't deter Fischer in his continued quest to make Rushmore the best place on Earth; In fact, he becomes more resolute after meeting and falling in love with a Rushmore elementary school teacher (Olivia Williams' Ms. Cross). But it's an unrequited sort of love, sadly, and his grand gestures draw the ire of Dr. Guggenheim enough that he's expelled.\n\nIt isn't hard to watch this film now and understand why Schwartzman has become a sort of muse for Anderson. Of all Wes Anderson's characters, Fischer is arguably the most \"Anderson-ian.\" It's hard to imagine him truly belonging anywhere, yet, where you expect him to be the butt of certain ridicule, he always ends up ruling his proverbial roost. It's a little preposterous, but because Fischer is the film's protagonist, we accept it. It's what we want to happen. What's interesting about it-and what ultimately makes Rushmore a success-is that the other characters are (excepting a few kooky quirks) believable. It turns Rushmore into a parable of sorts. Anderson is the wacky Max Fischer, and we're the \"real people\" who're won over by him. If only real life always featured an \"Ooh La La\" dance party...\n\nThere's another essential character in the mix-Bill Murray's Herman Blume. A wealthy industrialist, Blume takes a liking first to Max, then to Ms. Cross. It's his relationship with the latter that drives the bulk of Rushmore's hilarious second half. To this point in his career, Murray hadn't successfully pulled off a role like this before. Now, it's his M.O.-especially when Anderson is behind the camera. Here, he's great. He and Schwartzman have particularly good chemistry.\n\nA lot of Rushmore's humor derives from Max's attempts to put on elaborate stage plays, including the Vietnam story he shares with an audience of all the film's principal characters during one of Rushmore's climactic sequences. To say it's a highlight within the film is an understatement. This scene is-in terms of craft as much as acting and writing-a highlight within Anderson's entire filmography. Just ask Mr. Littlejeans (\"Best play ever, man.\")\n\nRushmore ultimately encapsulates everything Anderson supporters love about his films, and his detractors have better things to say about it than any other Anderson effort. It's the way he mixes his standard stylistic impulses with things normal people say and do that puts it over the top. Is it the director's best film? Not for my money. But it's arguably his sweetest and definitely one of his most watchable.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/rushmore-review/",

            "content": "Being the film which established the career of Wes Anderson and put Bill Murray in the dramatic spotlight, Rushmore sounded like an innovative journey.\n\nRushmore was quite a polarizing film. There is no denying that it had its own version of brilliance, but the extent that the viewer embraces that is all dependent on how much tolerance they have for the iconic directorial style of Wes Anderson. As someone who finds his style odd in the wrong narrative and brilliant in the right one, I am someone who deciphers that it has polarizing results at times. In the case of Rushmore, I could feel true brilliance afoot.\nRushmore comes from long before Wes Anderson's massive budget ensemble cast spectacle films, limiting itself two a budget of $20 million. As a result, the man attempts to build all the style he can with what limitations come his way. And as a result, it is difficult to see them. The premise is a very oddball one as is the case with all of his films, and the fact that Rushmore is rooted more in reality than some of his more fantastical later works means that it can be difficult to fully embrace at times, but it was consistently entertaining one way or another. The narrative can prove all over the place at times because the many supporting characters are only lightly expanded upon and there is a very heavy extent of subject matter coming in from all directions. There is no telling where the story will go next because it is so full of surprises, even if not all of them are good. Yet even if the story can't always be perfect, the screenplay is full of very strong characters. There are essentially three main characters at the heart of the story who all have their own tale to share, and they are given a grand extent of the narrative each. The genuine dialogue in the film is also great because there is brilliant insight, clever wit and a style of writing so intelligent that it almost seems as if Wes Anderson has created his own language for the film. It is a brilliant combination of insightful academia and genuine character insight, smoothed into the everyday dialogue of the characters easily.\nThe style in Rushmore still manages to reach true heights of brilliance. Embodying the Wes Anderson vision with such tenacity, for better and for worse, Rushmore delivers it brilliantly. The loose narrative is a trademark of the director, but so is the incredible style of it. With a highly skilled ability to turn anything into imagery, Wes Anderson's film makes use of remarkably artistic manipulation of simplistic cinematography and gentle editing to go along with it. It finds life in every little detail of the scenery which is most impressive during the more bleak scenes where he brings colour into frames that are very heavily dominated by grey lighting The man's eye for imagery and mind for a brilliant script is what ties Rushmore together and makes the experience unforgettable. \nThe musical score is also terrific, further mystifying the experience by reinforcing its somewhat surrealist mood.\nYet perhaps the most gripping thing about Rushmore was the leading performance from Jason Schwartzman. For an actor making his debut, Jason Schwartzmen is the flawless embodiment of a truly brilliant Wes Anderson creation. So tenaciously dedicated to capturing every inch of the character, everything from his perceived perfections to his insecurities. To balance them, he captures a personality which remains so relentlessly direct on delivering everything on his mind regardless of how intelligent or ignorant it could be. He is incredibly direct, and that headspace is so tenacious that after the film I was left in a state of mind where I frequently found myself speaking in the same manner as Jason Schwartzman with everything I said. I too found myself speaking swiftly and honestly in a manner which was clear without changing my tone of voice. In the most literal sense of the word, that means I could feel the character. Jason Schwartzman's performance resonated with me so heavily, and he was able to create a character who was both awkward and yet sympathetic as well as dramatic and hilarious at times. He oscillates between the tones of comedy and drama while bringing a flawless delivery of Wes Anderson's script into play, so his performance is truly remarkable.\nBill Murray is also great. Though I'm more accustomed to seeing him work with Wes Anderson and in dramatic material, I can imagine how wonderful it would have been to witness the man take such a career turn back in 1998. Bill Murray retains some understated comic elements for his effort in Rushmore which bring in the laughter, but they are played into the film very sporadically so that it comes as a surprise. More of the time, he plays a dramatic spirit to the viewer which breaks free of his comic archetype extremely well. He established his comic nature as being his natural persona in countless films, but he does the same with his dramatic effort in Rushmore. His natural charm is a very ligthearted drama with a natural ability to bring comic life into unexpected situations, capitalizing on his best talents and some never-before-seen ones. Bill Murray is brilliant, succesfully sharing an excellent chemistry with Jason Schwartzman which proves to deliver both an exchange of dramatic wisdom between the talented actors as well as creating a comic chemistry where the two are able to bounce off of each other. Bill Murray's work with Wes Anderson in Rushmore can only be characterized by the final line in Casablanca, as being \"the beginning of a beautiful friendship\".\nOlivia Williams is also great. Capturing a natural level of sophistication in her role, Olivia Williams' charms easily trick audiences into falling in love with her in the same way Max Fischer does. Her genuine passion and gentle nature is so intrinsic to her that she is able to effectively stir up one of the most sympathetic characters of the story. She presents the source of much emotional difficulties to the main two male characters even though it is through no fault of her own, and her ability to keep her charm present through the lighthearted drama and comedy in the film brings a stronger sense of reality to the slight edge of surrealism in Rushmore.\nLuke Wilson is also a genial presence, and Stephen McCole's natural comic charm makes the experience funnier.\n\nSo though Rushmore has the stereotypical loose story of a Wes Anderson film with a lot of ambition to take in, the man's ability to create brilliant style as a director while backing it up with an intelligent script provides the front for a brilliantly atmospheric comedy-drama with impeccable acting.",

Bill Murray is also excellent here playing a varied and somewhat villainous role that reinvigorated his career and started a long-standing friendship with director Wes Anderson and subsequently appeared in every film he's made. The story is very simple with unattainable love being the big conflict, but with Anderson's brilliantly quirky style and hilarious brand of dark comedy the bigger moments are the exchanges between the characters with flawless dialogue. Schwartzman's character Max also writes and performs in elaborate plays that use as many special effects as an actual film and these are easily my favourite scenes in the film; the ending Vietnam play is outrageous! Wes Anderson films are one of a kind and if you're a fan of his work or off-beat films in general, this is a must-see.",

Also, the \"stakes\" weren't all that high for the most part - the only one who really had something to lose was Bill Murray's character.  Nevertheless, it was well-written with a good mix of humor and strife.  Love the scale of the high school production at the end.   Lots of good stuff here, including a superb soundtrack; though it didn't feel as true to Wes Anderson's unique style as the other films of his I have seen and the dark moments that do pop up are quickly squelched where they possibly could have been investigated further.\n\nGrade = 7.5/10",

Hugely funny with some pretty unlikeable characters, the jokes come thick, fast and dark. Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray are fabulous, with terrific support from Olivia Williams and Brian Cox. The writing is excellent and the trademarks of Anderson's other films are mostly already there in this incredibly assured early film.",

            "content": "The best part about Wes Anderson's filmmaking is that none of his films feel the same but have the same quality to them. In Rushmore he has his quirky characters and colors for sure, but the story isn't like anything I've seen before. It follows the story of really bright schoolboy, Max Fischer, who uses all his potential towards extracurricular activities. The headmaster of Rushmore tells him that if he doesn't get his grades up they will throw him out of the school. This is the film that really glorifies Anderson's unique style of writing. You'll never see a movie quite like this anytime soon, it's goofy, it's romantic, it's sometimes hard to bear, and it's very VERY intelligent. His dialogue he writes for the characters always sounds really interesting and I'm always on board with the story due to their convincing speech and tones. This is also giving credit to the great performances by the leading cast. Jason Schwartzman gives a great performance in his first ever role and it's sure as heck a memorable one. Bill Murray didn't feel like he phoned it in this time and really paid off because his character was very charismatic and fun to watch as he was pit against the pretentious Max. The supporting cast is just as fun as the main cast because since they don't play as big of a role they can be as kooky as they need to be and still make the story seem relevant and on point. The two sons of Herman, Dirk, and even Margaret were really fun characters despite their limited screen time. Anderson really shines when it comes to overall character buildup and their change throughout the film. The characters all learn something and it never felt forced. However some parts of the film were slower than others and I partly feel that was just because there were so many details that had to be addressed that it just took a few scenes to explain what really would go down. This movie was really entertaining when it wasn't slow and it was quick with the punches and it felt exciting for a majority of the film. The soundtrack was phenomenal given the independent film setting and the quirky scene transitions. It just felt fitting. Rushmore overall is a solid effort by awes Anderson. It has plenty of laughs, a great cast, a very original story, and lots of great visuals. B+",

He creates his films the way wants them and through that he is able to deliver stories and worlds that are original and most importantly entertaining. Bottle Rocket was Anderson putting his foot in the door, proving to not just his peers and his audiences, but also to himself. That debut film has given him the confidence in his ability to write original and risky materials. Many would consider his sophomore film, Rushmore, as his magnum opus; and I can completely empathise to those who feel this way, but since I was introduced to his works during the recent stages of his career, my standards were shaped from it, therefore looking back at Rushmore and Bottle Rocket, I could not help but feel underwhelmed by its restricted and small nature.\n\nWes Anderson and Owen Wilson collaborate once more after Bottle Rocket to create Rushmore; the story of a young man named Max Fischer and his pursue of winning the heart of a teacher in his prestigious school, Rushmore. The film's ground-shaking complication occurs more towards midway through the film and its best to come into it blind, as Anderson's films are always more effective when he surprises us with a reaction or a situation that would often leave its audience with instant laughter. In comparison to Anderson and Wilson's debut film, Rushmore shifts its priorities towards characterisation and wraps the film's incidents around it. Bottle Rocket felt like it was trying to capture a much bigger picture, and its characters act more as drivers or guide in helping us get to where we need to go. Rushmore does the opposite, demanding the audience to participate in Max's journey and find the film's purpose within it; in short, it is the ride, not the destination.\n\nRushmore is a film that explores the necessity for class and sophistication. Max is an individual who believes that it isn't the core and fundamentals that makes one significant, it\u00e2??s the extra aspects of one's personality and experience that makes one stand out from the rest; hence the attachments he has for his school campus and the \"extra-curricular\" activities he builds or signs himself up for. It could also be a subtle facade he creates in order to hide the simplicity of his home life. His obsession of sophistication has led him to pursue the perfect woman. A woman like her is clearly perfect for him but his love for her has deluded him from reality, dismissing logic and foregoing other potential candidates. Anderson handles it in such a way that certainly feels distant at first, as the quirkiness of his character makes it difficult to relate to his insecurities and vulnerabilities. It was also difficult at first to empathise towards his attraction for Rosemary as the film never provides any obvious exposition. My second viewing of the film, made it much easier as I was able to push past the character's disguise and see more of what makes him human.\n\nPaternal relationships are bread and butter in a Wes Anderson film. I cannot say whether or not these fictional relationships are autobiographically based, or he simply just has strong understanding of the issue? Rushmore, aside from Bottle Rocket, is the more subtle film from Anderson that deals with this type of dysfunction. Max is clearly disappointed with his home life and the career path that his father has chosen, but it never becomes the central problem of the film; it lurks on the back of Max's mind, subconsciously affecting the reactions and decisions he makes. The father-son relationship dynamic mainly grows from Max's relationship with Herman Blume, a rich but sad man due to the crumbling of his marriage. Max's fascination of Herman is due to the inspiring stature that he brings to his appearance; this is an individual that Max ambitiously wants to be. Herman's interest in Max is due to the fact that he is the only one that truly appreciates him, listening and finding value to the words that come of his mouth; and that is all he really wants anyway, but since his home and family life is not willing to provide that, he had to find alternative individuals who could meet his needs. Eventually the dynamic shifts and the two individuals become more like peers. From there, the relationship becomes more mature and hilarious but also emotional elements begin to surface. The film's latter half is certainly more effective because of this shift in dynamic, allowing the audience to see more behind the film's three central characters.\n\nRushmore is both a visual and audible delight. Anderson, with a higher budget, has improved the film's cinematography in order for the audience to gain a closer look to his intended vision. He and his long-time collaborator, Robert Yeoman, has opted to use wider lenses in order to fabricate that sense of oddness to its characters, making it easier for the audience to be accepting of their quirky personalities and the reactions they give to particular situations. It also allows Anderson's trademark symmetrical centred shots to be conveyed in a more effective way. The film's childlike and escaping musical score, composed by Mark Mothersbaugh, helps emphasise that sense of class that the film is trying to achieve in its protagonist and his environment. His score also helps in softening the film's themes, allowing them to come off as accessible and only with a hint of comedic darkness to them. The film's garage rock and folk inspired soundtrack were certainly more effective here than it was on Bottle Rocket. It gives the film that edge that would eventually be lost in Anderson's future films.\n\nThe performances in this film were enjoyable, but nothing spectacular or amazing. For a debut role, this was an impressive one by Jason Schwartzman. He was able to balance the character's child-like and adult tendencies, allowing the role to feel complex and human, but under Anderson's direction he allows the character's idiosyncrasies to be highlighted. It is always wonderful to see Bill Murray in a role that is outside of his trademarks. Murray allows his character to become vulnerable, which he does so well, and through that I was able to buy into the character during its emotional and thematically heavy moments that mainly takes place during the film's second-final act. I have already seen Murray at his peak, which was Lost in Translation, and what he brings in Rushmore only scratches the surface of what he could bring. Then again, his role here does possess more comedic qualities than his magnum opus role; and in Rushmore he is under the direction of Anderson who leans towards the deadpan sensibilities when shaping his characters. Therefore, I shouldn't complain too much.\n\nRushmore is an improvement in all aspects from his debut film, and provides a step closer to the director's full potential.",

This also contains some great little characters,\nbeautiful looking cinematography and sets that look like they were\ncrafted for every great high school movie ever. With it's quirkiness\nand a style that many people may very much enjoy, I felt that it was\nfirmly very good and here below is why I felt that way about it.\n\nThe story is massively fun to say it is so short, it is so quirky and\nwell crafted, it could be said the end gets slightly more dull but\ngenerally it very entertaining throughout. I felt the comedy was maybe\nnot massively funny but when it is funny, it pretty much is laugh out\nloud and coupled with the more dramatic parts, it is very fun to watch.\nThe middle part of the movie is very fun, you will see what I mean if\nyou see it but it at times can be very enjoyable to see it all.\n\nThe main big performance here comes from Bill Murray and his very funny\nbut different than usual acting display. Murray seems to blend his\nqualities in humour with a way of acting like a slob to create a\nmemorable character who eclipses others in the film. Jason Schwartzman\nis the actual main actor here and he is pretty good to say he is so\nyoung and a crazy character who is unlikeable at times, Olivia Williams\nis also steady as the teacher in which she plays a pivotal role within\nthe film.\n\nWes Anderson's quality script is one of the shining lights of this film\nand his vision of this high school movie is seen out so well along with\nthe performances. I liked the directing also but another massive\npositive behind the cameras is well, the cameras themselves in the\ncinematography which is at times maybe a bit strange but mostly is\nbeautifully shot and just simple scenes without much meaning are done\nreally well to say this isn't a film that had to do such things.\n\nCriticisms wise it doesn't have loads but the lack of comedy I think\nhits it, as said it is hilarious at times but a few more strong jokes\ncould have and would have scored it higher. I wasn't too keen on the\nlapsing end of the movie where you can feel it has no ending in sight,\nit does finally end but it may make you slightly confused and possibly\neven bored with it. It could be said it is too short but it just about\nsqueezes out what it wants to get out.\n\nI think teens yes may like it but everyone can certainly love it, it\nhas that quirky style so many cult films seem to have and I believe\nthis can be just that. If you like Bill Murray's style of comedy then I\nwill actually say you could not appreciate him here but he brings\nsomething new and it really shows off by the end. It actually can be\npretty sweet as well at times so if you want a fun quirky and at times\na sweet film, this is exactly your type of film.\n\nOverall I give this a low 8/10 and it is Firmly Very Good movie, not quite\nGreat or Excellent but nevertheless very highly scored. With this you\njust have to sit back and enjoy the stuff going on throughout, couldn't\nrecommend it more to most film fans and I imagine some will love this\nmuch more than I did, and I enjoyed it. One more thing to add, it can\nget kind of busy in the middle and not confusing but mixed up so bare\nwith it and it will pay off for you in the end.",

It's in its own defining way a coming-of-age film for a little amount of time.\n\nThe film opens like it's behind the curtains, and we're at the titular private school. Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman at his acting debut) is an eccentric student with a unique characteristic of being the school's smartest scholar by overdoing elaborate extracurricular activities as his main focus than his studies and caring a little about his grades for some reason. He soon goes downhill when he fell in love with a teacher Ms. Cross (Olivia Williams), and started doing everything he can to catch her heart. But before that major distraction from his usual stuff, he befriended a company owner Mr. Blume (Bill Murray).\n\nMr. Blume wasn't having a good time such as having dissatisfactions about his company, and having frustrations upon his wife and spoiled sons.  Max represents the positivity of Mr. Blume's life, until the two unfortunately started following this line against each other for the attraction of Ms. Cross: \"all fair in love and war.\" So Mr. Blume represents the man Ms. Cross prefer than a youngster - the negativity side of Max's life: rejection and no appreciation, next to distraction. But instead, they only sabotage each other's luck, which led to nothing.\n\nJason Schwartzman made a really good debut for an actor with such performance he'd done in this film. Next to him is Bill Murray who also performed well.\n\n\"Rushmore\" is a good treat like any other Wes Anderson films. (B+)",

When I first watched it I found it pretty irritating, but eventually it grew on me and it became my favorite movie. Don't believe? I got the movie poster on my wall to prove it. Now I love all of the movies of Wes Anderson.\n\nNow on to the actual review. Rushmore is a fantastic quirky, coming-of-age picture that has a good story and stars Jason Schwartzman in his film debut and the very funny Bill Murray. At first this movie irritated me because of its quirky, off-beat, dry, subtle humor that I just wasn't use to. Now I've got the whole concept of it and I love it. Wes Anderson creates something beautiful and special here with Rushmore. It's a wonderful comedy about Max Fisher who attends Rushmore Academy and loves to make up a new club practically each week. Until he is on sudden-death academic probation and if he doesn't shape up he'll be kicked out of school. He also befriends Herman Blume, a melancholy millionaire and father of twins who are in Max's class. They both share a mutual love for a first grade teacher, Ms. Cross (played by Olivia Williams) and fight for her affection. The whole concept of it is just like a Roald Dahl book that Roald Dahl never wrote. Rushmore is a wonderful dramedy with mighty fine performances from Schwartzman and Murray. Anderson and Wilson show that they have a knack for cockeyed humor. Rushmore is beautiful, funny movie about adolescence, betrayal, love, and disillusion.",

Jason Schwartzman plays Max Fischer, and over-involved prep student who falls in love with an elementary teacher named Ms. Cross (Olivia Williams).  Of course, this does not happen without controversy and the interactions between him and other characters are often hilarious.

A 15-year-old boy without the slightest notion of proportionality supposed to measure the ways of a teenager in his age when getting along with other people. He treats old-timers and youths as if they were all his equals, endowed with fearless bravura and propelled by his creative and enterprising wits. His hyperbolic character leads him to casually spark a friendship with a much older industrial man who builds admiration for the boy's pseudo-adult attitude. Both of them eventually find their hearts beating for the same woman, a beautiful teacher in Rushmore school, where Max... doesn't study. Each one will try to win the teacher's love in his own way and naturally the romantic mechanics between a bold 15-year-old boy and a woman with the competition of an even older man mixed in is a recipe for bizarre and hilarious situations throughout. I enjoyed very much the theater play scenes, they gave another quality and vitality to \"Rushmore\". In a way, those scenes highlighted the evidence that there's a clear contrast between what can be real and what cannot, the difference between reality and fiction. Reality is not utopian like fiction, nothing happens out of pure will. Anything demands effort, patience and sense of proportionality. Everything comes in its right time and has its own place. A lesson that young Max Fischer has learned by the end of the film.\n\nWes Anderson likes to fantasize with people, seems like he is trying to capture some precious unobtainium underlying human relations and psyche. He plays with personal and social limits. There's usually a somewhat eccentric character, or group of characters, who have to endure against ordeals to reach the desired goal or redemption. Personal development is a common theme in Wes Cinema. Prominent attention is given to small gestures, either manifestations of affection or contempt. Younger people are an important part of the social mechanics and adults can't get away from giving satisfactions to youths when these so demand. In fact, children have almost adultlike maturity and social skill. This particular point is source of great amusement for me, but it's subtle. Max Fischer is that taken to the limit. So far, Wes movies have left me with the feeling of a bittersweet spell hovering over all human relations. They're sweet movies in an unreal way, but although it's artificially crafted sweetness, it feels natural and organic. Everything flows coherently in a mannerist way. The acting could be better, but it's not too distracting. \"Rushmore\" is smartly written, technically flawless, engaging, emotionally powerful and super fun! I burst into laughter on almost regular basis, I love the way how Wes constantly throws in snippets of humor to keep a smile on my face. Flavored and tasty Cinema. Wonderful cinematography and Olivia Williams is a goddess! I enjoyed \"Rushmore\" very much. Recommended!",

For me, it's going to Rushmore.\"\n\nThe Royal Tenenbaums has always been my favorite Wes Anderson movie and I always thought it was because it was the first one of his that I had seen, but it can officially move over now because I have a new favorite: Rushmore. This film was so charming, the soundtrack so cool, and the characters so well developed that I was completely in love with it once the credits started rolling. Not only is it my favorite Wes Anderson film, but it also belongs on my all time favorite list as well. I am a sucker for coming of age stories and this was a great one with perhaps one of Anderson's best developed characters from all his filmography: Max Fischer. All of Anderson's films have a similar style with offbeat and quirky themes and a hyper reality where the characters sometimes resemble those we imagine in our heads when we are reading a fantasy book. At times they are hard to connect with because they seem to belong in another time and place, but Wes manages to draw us into his world kind of like in the same way we are drawn to a theater play. That is why I also loved the special touches from Anderson as he incorporates school plays with wonderful productions into his movies. I think Rushmore is his most complete film with a charming ending, a memorable odd couple pairing, and a weird love triangle that features some of Anderson's most romantic work (similar in that sense to Moonrise Kingdom). As much as I enjoyed his first film, Bottle Rocket, it was Rushmore where he truly defines and finds his style with those production designs that seem taken from a stage play or a colorful children's book (especially seen in the scenes where Max visits the principal's office). I absolutely fell in love with Rushmore and this will be the measuring stick for Wes Anderson's films from now on.\n\nThis wonderful and witty screenplay written by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson begins with a dream sequence where Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is in math class solving an extremely difficult equation and thus saving his classmates from ever having to open a math book again. His friend, Dirk (Mason Gamble), awakes him just before a millionaire industrialist named Herman Blue (Bill Murray) is about to begin his chapel speech. He has two sons in Rushmore Academy, one of the most expensive and prestigious schools in the country. Max is fascinated by this man's speech and so at the end he introduces himself to Herman and the two form a special bond together. Max is in love with Rushmore and his entire life revolves around the school and he finds in Herman someone who has achieved the success he's aiming for, while Herman is a disillusioned man who has lost his purpose in life and sees in Max someone determined who enjoys life. Up to this point one would think Max is the perfect student, but the school's headmaster, Dr. Guggenheim (Brian Cox) explains to Herman that he actually is the worst scholarly student due to his involvement in dozens of extracurricular activities (such as being the editor of the school newspaper, president of the chess, astronomy, beekeeping, and French clubs, captain of the fencing team, and director of the school play). Unlike the rest of the students, Max isn't a wealthy kid, his father Bert (Seymour Cassel) is a barber, so he's a scholarship student that is about to lose it due to his bad grades. Max and Herman's friendship is tested when they both fall in love with the widowed first grade teacher, Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). This is were the thin line between friends and enemies begin as Max and Herman begin a feud over Miss Cross.\n\nWhat makes Rushmore stand out above other Wes Anderson films (I have liked all of them) is the great pairing of Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray's characters. Both of them, despite having completely opposite personalities, complete each other because they see in each other what they want to become. Max aspires to be successful in life and doesn't want to become a barber like his father (that is why he always lies about his profession), while Herman despite having it all is completely disillusioned with his marriage and spoiled children. Max's passion for life is what captivates Herman because it is what he has lost. This bond is broken once Rosemary enters the picture and they both become infatuated with winning her love. Max will do anything for her, including building a giant aquarium in the school's baseball diamond or directing a successful play. Max is my favorite character despite not being entirely likable, while Murray's portrayal of Herman is sensational. He delivers one of his best and most memorable performances and shines in each scene he shares with Max or Rosemary. There are several hilarious lines and quirky moments that also balanced out perfectly with the more subtle emotional and romantic ones. This film has a lot of heart and Anderson really delivers here with his unique style (a lot of his trademarks can be found here like the slow-motion and wide angle shots, the inclusion of at least one Rolling Stones song on the soundtrack, the underwater shot, and the influence of the Charlie Brown cartoon). It's an inspired film and Anderson creates a unique world that at times seems distant from reality, but somehow he manages to create these rich characters that are easy to identify with or relate to in such a way that they manage to touch us without being overly sentimental.",

Rushmore follows a student at a school named Rushmore, and a rich industrialist, fight for an elementary school teacher.  Anderson uses many of his quirks that give the film a distinct narrative and visual style, and it explores the characters without losing focus on the plot.  The focus on the characters is well-crafted as their backgrounds, family, and personal lives are explored, giving filmgoers top-notch characterization.  The film has nonstop laughs and emotion, courtesy of co-writer/director Wes Anderson, and co-writer (also long-time collaborator) Owen Wilson.  Rushmore explores the themes of love, friendship, trust, and what you're chasing.  Wes Anderson is great in the director's chair, using his visual style to aid with the narrative in the story, and he and Wilson craft a hilarious and intelligent script that make this 100% entertaining.  The acting is great, and the debut of Jason Schwartzman is no exception, especially when alongside Bill Murray, another collaborator, and a comedy great that shows that he has a thing for independent films.  The chemistry between them is undeniable, and it proves to be a worthwhile \"bromance\" if you think about it (probably not though).  Bill Murray proves to be amazing in his role, and has an Independent Spirit Award, and a Golden Globe nod to prove it, even if it restrains him a little bit, although it does give audiences a more mature role for Murray.  A must-see, and proof that shows that independent films are in the rise, and that independent films could be better than mainstream films.",

            "content": "I simply had to see this 1998 comedy-drama directed by Wes Anderson about an eccentric teenager named Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman in his first film), his friendship with rich industrialist Herman Blume (Bill Murray), and their mutual love for elementary school teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). Somehow I missed it at the time (my life was crazy while I lived in Canberra) but after watching it today, I think that if I watched it at the time, I would love this piece co-written by Anderson and Owen Wilson. And I loved the music - the soundtrack was scored by regular Anderson collaborator Mark Mothersbaugh and features several songs by bands associated with the British Invasion of the 1960s.\r\n\r\nWith this movie the careers of Anderson and Schwartzman were launched, while Bill Murray established a \"second career\" - as a respected actor of independent cinema. I liked his acting in this movie but I like Wes Anderson work even better. They both won Best Director and Best Supporting Male awards at the 1999 Independent Spirit Awards while Murray earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture. Anderson and Wilson wrote the role of Mr. Blume with Bill Murray in mind, but doubted they could get the script to him. Luckily, Murray's agent was a fan of Anderson's first film, Bottle Rocket, and urged the actor to read the script for Rushmore. Murray liked it so much that he agreed to work for scale, which Anderson estimated to be around $9,000. Murray liked the neat and precise writing and felt that a lot of the film was about the struggle to retain civility and kindness in the face of extraordinary pain. And he stated that he felt a lot of that in his life. Anderson created detailed storyboards for each scene but was open to Murray's knack for improvisation, and that is how the winning formula worked.\r\n\r\nAccording to ShortList, it is one of the 30 coolest films ever... but, I really had a problem with the unconvincing make up and costumes through the first two thirds of the movie, especially for the main character. Well, nothing is perfect... it is important that Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson successfully created their own slightly heightened reality... Like Max Fischer, Wilson was expelled from his prep school, St. Mark's School of Texas, in the tenth grade, while Anderson shared Max's ambition, lack of academic ability, and had a crush on an older woman ( just for record - Anderson and Wilson began writing the screenplay for Rushmore years before they made Bottle Rocket). For both of them the thing that was most appealing was the initial idea of a 15-year-old kid and a 50-year-old man becoming friends and equals. \r\n\r\nMaybe it's time for you, like it was for me, to check out this artwork with deep-focus widescreen compositions possessing an unusual clarity that adds details enhancing plenty of the action constantly developing and adding vividness to be remembered. Enjoy the humour as well!",

The film has all the elements of a cult film, avoiding all conventionalities of commercial filmmaking and made in that original Wes Anderson style. Still treading on deadpan comedy grounds, Rushmore is also a real gem that differentiates itself from teenage angst films of the time and in fact appears too different to even be considered one.",

While Bottle Rocket has inklings of what's to come, Rushmore is a more fully realized effort.  The narrative flows effortlessly, the performances are pitch perfect melancholy enthusiasm (yes, that's a real thing...or I'm making it a real thing) and the same tone remains throughout.  That maintained, almost restrained and understated atmosphere allows for the eccentric characters to shine, and for the escalating antics to seem, well, not so out of place.  It deftly walks the entire spectrum from funny to somber without tipping the balances and becoming maudlin or manipulative.  Oh!  And that soundtrack!",

It's not always pretty, and you may not always be rooting for the protagonist, but that's what makes it interesting. On top of having a great story and direction, the acting and editing are superb. I really can't say much else about it. It's a solid comedy with fascinating characters and a lot of heart.
