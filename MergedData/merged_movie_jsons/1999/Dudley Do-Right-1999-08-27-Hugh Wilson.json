It's harmless fluff, silly in many parts but also a movie filled with likable characters and good adult jokes that go over the kids' heads. It's clean stuff: references to other movies and things. It's one of these films you find yourself laughing more than the kids but the next day you really can't remember much that you saw. In other words, you will be entertained but it's not a memorable movie.The horse might be in the running as the most memorable character in the film. Even the villain isn't despicable. He's more cartoon-like than evil. Alfred Molina does a nice job as \"Snidely Whiplash.\" Eric Idle and Sarah Jessica Parker are also good in here.Brendan Fraser, playing the title role, was on a role their for a couple of years, playing these silly, comedic roles and being successful in doing so (i.e. George Of The Jungle, Bedazzled, etc.)Don't dismiss this as totally stupid. It will surprise you. All of us can use a good laugh and this movie provides plenty.",

            "review_title": "Fraser's weaker cartoon adaptation",
            "content": "During his rise to stardom, Brendan Fraser had become quite the leading man when it came to films in the family and adventure genres. After getting his big break with Disney in Jay Ward's live-action George of the Jungle (1997) and landed in the smash hit movie reboot The Mummy (1999), he had the reputation as a solid bankable star. Which naturally led him back to participating in a film quite similar to that of George of the Jungle (1997). Stepping back into the cartoon live-action genre, Fraser landed the role of Dudley Do-Right (1999), another Jay Ward based cartoon. Sadly, this one didn't have the same appeal. While it does have its moments there are several problems too.The Dudley Do-Right (1969) cartoon was a short lived show that didn't make it past 1 season and was very much similar in plot to that of Popeye. For this feature, it was kept the same where Dudley Do-Right (Brendan Fraser) the protagonist has been working to do his best to outsmart Snidely Whiplash (Alfred Molina), his childhood (now grown up) arch enemy. Together these two old foes square off for the affections of Nell Fenwick (Sarah Jessica Parker) who can't seem to make up her mind as to who is the better individual. As if it was hard to tell. The adaption was written and directed by Hugh Wilson, a veteran of many comedies in the past like Police Academy (1984) and Rhustler's Rhapsody (1985). The difference is, those were original works.Here Wilson seems to struggle between what exactly is necessary and what isn't for a number of components. Right from the start, the movie begins with a Jay Ward Short under the \"Fractured Fairy Tales\" banner. Unlike George of the Jungle (1997) and even The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle, which began as cartoons and led into the live action feature. Here the cartoon short is comical, but completely unrelated to the feature. What is the point? But that's not the only thing that drags, the pacing tends to feel overly drawn out for needless reasons too. There's a number of scenes where dance numbers take center stage over carrying the plot through. They are well choreographed, but that doesn't take away the pointlessness of having it.There's also weak character development among the main characters. Nell really doesn't change and neither does Snidely. Really it's just Dudley who is shown this from a hobo played by Eric Idle. And while there are certain aspects to the supporting characters that can be important, most don't move the plot. There's also appearances from Robert Prosky as Nell's father. Alex Rocco plays the Chief of a Native American tribe and Jack Kehler plays one of Snidely's right hand henchmen. Lastly there's Corey Burton who oddly enough sounds like Keith Scott's impression of the narrator from George of the Jungle (1997) and The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle (2000). All in all, the actors act okay. It's just the script that stilts them in making their characters any more likable.Cinematography on the other hand was well shot by Donald E. Thorin, cameraman of Lock Up (1989), Tango & Cash (1989) and Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995). Again, while some scenes were not crucial to have in the picture, they were all competently filmed with a wide angle lens. As for music, Steve Dorff served as composer to the film. And while an official soundtrack nor score was released, the music matches the scenes at hand and the TV show theme is revisited. Out of the three cartoon movies mentioned, The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle (2000) was the only film to get its own score released. So weird.This cartoon live-action adaptation isn't as bad as the score says it is, but it is not that great either. There are some funny moments, the actors try, the camerawork is well done and the music fits. Yet there are several over padded scenes, little character development and unneeded characters.",

            "content": "Jay Ward's cute but bland cartoon about Canada's No. #1 Mountie plays even worse when brought to the big screen as a live-action comic adventure. Brendan Fraser is spirited and very adept at buffoonish slapstick, but he's not the right actor for Dudley Do-Right; he's a big, handsome lunk, and he's cheerful enough, but he doesn't know how to mug, nor is he helped by his limited voice (a deep monotone). It's always nice to see Sarah Jessica Parker in a film, but she isn't cast right either; as love-interest Nell, Parker gets no funny lines, she's too modern and grounded a presence, although she does help enliven a dance sequence about 47 minutes into the proceedings. Alfred Molina attempts to have fun as egomaniacal villain Snidely Whiplash, but his voice and fake mustache are his only props. The pithy announcer gets some dryly comic lines and Dudley's horse (named Horse, ha ha) shoots off a few raspberries, but this is a very dim slapstick vehicle, short on inspiration, poorly conceived and even more unmemorable than its cartoon predecessor. * from ****",

Yet, despite all the energy and frenetic comedy, the film never feels indulgent.The plot is, of course, nonsense. But then again you hardly want a family movie to have a labyrinth plot. Dudley Do-Right may have flopped but I don't know why. It's in the same field as the terrible \"Waterboy\" but that made over $100, 000, 000. This I won't understand. Maybe it's only because Canadians will truly love the intellectually-challenged Mountie.",

            "content": "What we have here is a failure to communicate any of the satire created by genius Jay Ward! Mr. Wilson made so many mistakes in telling Dudley's story that I believe this is simply not the Dudley Do-Right story, this was someone elses story. The set up should have centered more on the Mounties and less on Whiplash's plan, which dominated the entire film. Never once did Dudley have to rescue Nell, in fact, she seemed smittened by Whiplash. This gave less-than-attractive Sara Jessica Parker very little to do, not that as an actress, she has much to bring to the table. Aside from this, her character, Nell, was (under) written as though the writer (s) didn't want the character in the first place. Maybe, because Parker was re-cast in the role. Second Choice?The character of Horse, which could have been an interesting character asset to Dudley were is not for the fact that he disappears a quarter into the film without explanation, was handled wrong. Likewise, Eric Idle's character seemed as though he might have been three separate characters in an original draft of the script. And now strung together, so the producers could use Idle's talents.The flavor of the original cartoon is no where to be found.Fraser and Alex Rocco were as wonderful as Parker and Molina were not up to snuff. However considering what they had to work with -- they were all okay ... silly set-ups, no pay offs and a script that seemed aimless at times leaves devotees of genius Jay Ward saddened.",

DUDLEY DO-RIGHT, the motion picture (yet another money seeking \"parody\" on cartoons of the 1960's...BORIS AND NATASHA, GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE, etc.) had the potential. Brendan Fraser is a very talented actor, and is not too darn hard on the eyes...*ahem*. Sarah Jessica Parker, Alfred Molina, Alex Rocco, Eric Idle and one of my favorite character actors, Robert Prosky, head up the cast. So, what exactly went wrong? Well, how about a lame, unfunny script that made for 83 minutes of painful viewing? I think we're getting WARM. Very few chuckles here, provided mostly by Eric Idle and Alex Rocco, who do the best with what they have. This was the only thing that saved DUDLEY DO-RIGHT from being a complete catastrophe. If this is the only thing left on the video shelf, make a night of it with a game of Monopoly or Yahtzee, instead. You'll thank yourself in the morning.",

And while it can come off as infantile and clunky, it's just plain and simple fun in the tradition of \"Ernest Saves Christmas.\" You have Brendan Fraser (\"George of the Jungle\") in the title role of a clueless Canadian Mounty both vying for the hand of Nell Fenwick (Sarah Jessica Parker in, oddly enough, the least phoned-in role of her career) and struggling with the evil Snidely K. Whiplash (Alfred Molina). Before he can mount his flatulent horse (named Horse, of course), though, he's reduced to taking vigilante lessons from a prospector (Monty Python's Eric Idle) who recently made a splash on the \"Regis & Kathy Lee Show\".Ridiculousness aside, this was a funny, lightweight, enjoyable movie that didn't match the cleverness of \"The Dudley Do-Right Show,\" but still provides a laugh and does well as a guilty pleasure.

            "content": "Dudley Do-Right, Canadian Mountie (Brendan Fraser) is on his post in a remote village in Canada. A lifelong resident of the area, it was Dudley's childhood dream to become a Mountie. He lives in a small cabin with only his horse, Horse, as a companion. Yet, two people from Dudley's past resurface in the small, nearby village. One is Nell (Sara Jessica Parker) who Dudley has loved since their tweenage years. She has returned from a trip around the world and is more lovely than ever. But, alas, the other returnee is the dastardly Snidely Whiplash (Alfred Molina). He was Dudley's rival for Nell's affections long ago, despite his evil and conniving ways. Soon, Snidely has taken over the town's businesses, by hook and by crook, and is making a big play for Nell's attention while Dudley manages to upset the ruling party in Ottawa and is fired from his post. The world is looking pretty harsh to Dudley, that is for certain. Will he recover his job and win the heart of Nell? This is a second, cartoon-based film for Fraser, after the infinitely more successful George of the Jungle. The same creative minds were at work here but the results are far from perfect. Don't blame the cast, however, for Fraser, Parker, and Molina, with a bit of help from Eric Idle and Alex Rocco, are the reasons to see the film at all. Simply put, they are terrific and rise above the mundane script and uneven direction. Certainly, there are some very funny scenes, such as the one in which Snidely orders a poor lady and her children out of their home or where Dudley has the bad luck to have a moose head fall on him during a critical moment with Nell. Now, that's entertainment. Unfortunately, though, a few good scenes do not a great film make. Yet, if you like silly nonsense with likable stars, you might take a chance with this film. Yes, it may elicit a yawn here or there, but it's truly not a bad way to spend a couple of leisure hours.",

You gotta love how SNidely tricks 999 criminals to going to Africa to get him...even though hes standing right there wearing a bandana over his face.

I don't really mind some of it, but I didn't really agree with the liberties taken with historical context.  The original cartoon was set \"at the close of the 19th century.\"  So I had something of a problem with Dudley driving an SUV and using a cell phone.  But I did enjoy the slapstick, which keeps in pattern with \"George of the Jungle.\"  And while Brendan Fraser as Dudley Do-Right and Sarah Jessica Parker as Nell Fenwick don't quite hit their marks, Alfred Molina makes a perfect Snidely Whiplash.

The marketing that unashamedly said \"From the creator of George of the Jungle...and the star of George of the Jungle...and the acclaimed director who saw George of the Jungle...\" gives an idea of what motivated the production of this film. Despite the tongue in cheek approach to the material, the movies sedate pacing in which 80% of the gags limp across screen longer than they should make this film a chore to sit through even at a brisk running time of about 70 minutes not including credits. Hugh Wilson worked with Brenden Fraser on the comparatively decent Blast from the Past(though admittedly I was not a fan) and even did the first Police Academy film which despite some hiccups I still feel holds up, everyone involved in this movie has done good work before and while this isn't an embarrassing misfire, it still is surprising given the talent involved. If anyone remembers the old Rocky and Bullwinkle show from which the character of Dudley Do-Right originated, the show was more or less a parody of melodramas from the silent film era like The Perils of Pauline. They varied in length from about 5-7 minutes but they were never the draw for the show as a whole as segments like Fractured Fairy Tales, the serialized Rocky & Bullwinkle stories, and Aesop and Son's Fables offered more variety and types of humor than the rather repetitive formula of Dudley Do-Right that while pleasant enough never really offered much in the way of variety. Dudley Do-Right is bland, inoffensive, and mostly harmless, but it's also not nearly as funny asit wants to be with humor free dry patches of choreographed dance sequences, vehicular stunts, and boring dialogue heavy scenes which have fart noises and cartoon whizzes and wooshes painfully shoehorned in a vain attempt to make the movie seem zanier than it is. SIDE NOTE: the budget for this movie was supposedly $70 Million but it looks cheap and ugly and at no point can you see that money on the screen. This movie belongs in the same category as films like Inspector Gadget and Mr. Magoo, taking cartoons that never had much substance to begin with and stretching them out so what little charm and appeal they had in the first place are no longer visible.",

            "content": "There are two kinds of bad comedies. The first kind - let's call them the 'Adam Sandlers' - lazily try to dispute their indisputable 'bad' status. Braying with smarmy self-importance and bleating for affirmation, they're all the more contemptible for it. The second kind are the Dudley Do-Rights: sweet, innocent creatures, either dopily unaware or uncaring of their fundamental mediocrity. Content to simply be, they provide the basest of childish entertainment at all costs. We're talking the kind of cinema where the same 'getting bonked in the head by a loose floorboard' gag, if you can call it that, is repeated not once. Not twice, not three times. But upwards of eight. You know -in case you didn't get enough in Brendan Fraser's former George of the Jungle. But that's not the only trick up the film's sleeve! Love farting horses? Then oh boy do we have a show for you!Tone is everything, though. And it's because of this that Dudley Do-Right, almost worrisomely idiotic as it (mostly) is, is resoundingly hard not to take to. It's unflinchingly cheery and earnest, banking hard on every Canadian stereotype in the book without a hint of ironic revisionism. In doing so, it steadily wears the viewer down until it's almost impossible to resist a sheepish smile creeping across their face. It helps that creator Jay Ward's sly sensibility of playing things so ludicrously straight that a sneaky cleverness creeps up (we get a welcome reminder in the film's fantastic, old-timey 'Fractured Fairy tales' opening short) is dutifully replicated, if not perfected, by writer/director Hugh Wilson. He makes particularly good use of a joyfully hokey narrator, and allows occasional cheeky bits to creep in, enough to keep adults from drifting off entirely amidst the lazy slapstick and tritely wholesome morals. For example: here, uber-fiend Snidely Whiplash has evolved past simply tying damsels to train tracks (but don't worry - they've left one such sequence for posterity) to a more devious scheme involving rent-controlled properties and converting the superbly named Semi-Happy Valley into an exploitatively garish, faux gold-rush tourist town. It's a ploy so grotesque that it's, naturally, almost too close to home to laugh at, especially when Ottawa signs off on it for economic stimulation and job creation, leaving contemporary Canadian audiences flinching with unwanted flashbacks to the methodology of a certain unsavoury former administration (but let's not harp on about that).Sure, there's a bit of a clash between the film's overall rustic (read: cheap) look and the oddly inflated production values in its dance and vehicular chase scenes (though I'll never say no to impromptu tanks in a climactic showdown). And yes, there's a recurring bit involving a First Nations community which isn't as tongue-in-cheek as it'd like to think, dabbling in dubious racial politics (and don't worry - Brendan Fraser gets in on the redface too. Errgh...). It's mitigated (barely) by the superb commentary of how intensely 'authentic' it is, while the Chief later grumbles that they're \"basically doing dinner theatre here\", with their Riverdance bit being a particularly good seller. But hey - if Wilson's tentative forays into sociopolitical satire aren't for you, there's always a woodland training montage with a gamely silly comedy drunk Eric Idle, a surprisingly tasteful nod to Raiders of the Lost Ark with Alfred Molina, and... y'know...a bit where Dudley crashes around his lodge wearing a giant moose head. And you know you're a hoser if you can't appreciate a giant moose head gag.Brendan Fraser has built a career around playing adorably dim live action cartoon characters, and is astute enough to play Dudley's clueless earnestness wholly straight. He doesn't have much to work with here, but he pours on the charm like no tomorrow, and is winningly affable for it. Similarly, the always superb Alfred Molina is exquisitely cartoony, bagging the majority of the film's meagre laughs, and embodying Snidely Whiplash's trademark sneer with such outrageous commitment that it's almost alarming to see him turn around and realize he's still a three-dimensional, live action human. The normally intolerable Sarah Jessica Parker delivers the film's most remarkable feat by being...tolerable; in fact, her simpering vacuous Nell is almost likable, even vaguely funny at times (although juxtaposing her apparent slew of postsecondary degrees with her voluminous stupidity is a conceit which wears thin very quickly). Finally, adult viewers caught in the existential throes of 'how did I get here' might recognize Jack Kehler, otherwise known as the Dude's awkward landlord from The Big Lebowski, playing an expanded version of the same character as Snidely's second-in-command here, which brings delights of its own.Dudley Do-Right is not a good film by any stretch of the imagination, and even the youngest of kids are likely to call the bluff of its lazy, repetitive, shallow attempts at humour. And yet, Wilson's touch is so perennially chipper that the simplistic adventures of everyone's favourite cartoon Mountie here - thanks largely to tireless efforts by Molina, and Fraser's innate, goofy charisma - are still liable to raise a smile. And if you aren't able to suspend some measure of disbelief and ride out Dudley Do- Right with kernels of the most forgiving enjoyment... well then, take off, eh?-4/10",

But it was, sadly, the camel's nose under the tent.Did Hugh Wilson even WATCH any Dudley Do-Right cartoons as a kid? Did he rent videos or catch the Cartoon Channel? None of that shows.The classic scene of the cartoon, Snidely tying Nell to the tracks ... is STILL a cartoon here. They didn't even try to render the credits it in live action as with The Flintstones.Dudley, a blonde in the cartoon, was a brunette actor. He smiles a lot, has a big hero's chin, and is sort of dim but not such a stumblebum.And Nell, a redhead in the cartoon, was a blonde actress. But wait ... Sarah Jessica Parker isn't REALLY blonde. She had to color her hair or wear a wig and STILL got it wrong.Nell in the cartoon was content to live at the camp. But she was NOT stuck between Dudley and Snidely. Rather, she was stuck on HORSE!! And what happened to Horse's Mountie shirt and hat? This one in the movie was just a regular saddled horse. Inspector Fenwick in the cartoon is the camp commandant, a fist-pounding boss, not a soft-spoken retiree. And he wears the red uniform, just like Dudley. Was Hugh Wilson being \"accurate\" by having someone of the inspector's rank wear black? Why bother being accurate on this obscure point if you can't get the obvious things right?The real Snidely Whiplash has green skin. I forgive Alfred Molina for not donning greasepaint through the film. But at least we get a scene of him with a green face in the mudbath. Snidely is the ONLY character they got right.Other problems: The cartoon very obviously took place during the Klondike or Yukon Gold Rush days. The player-piano score gave it away. We;re talking late 19th century. They would NOT have helicopters, cars, tanks, etc.I remember, back in the '60s, the trend was the turn our beloved live-action heroes into cartoons and see them REALLY soar. Gone were the expenses of having to string George Reeves up on wires to have Superman fly. Now we could see Superman really fly and take on actual comic-book supervillains instead of always gangsters. And we got the Lone Ranger, Batman and eventually Star Trek in toon form and they all worked by doing things that would have been way too expensive in live action.Don't any of the directors remember that these cartoons were made for a reason? Too expensive to film live!Spielberg made The Flintstones work as nostalgia because he has the cash to be exacting in detail. For Hugh Wilson and all the rest, the lesson is simple: Watch the cartoon, note recurring themes, and most of all, don't do the show if you ain't got the dough!",

            "review_title": "A live-action adaptation held afloat by Alfred Molina's stylized portrayal of dastardly Snidely Whiplash (and held together by the trusty narrator!)",
            "content": "Whenever a cartoon is adapted to a live-action feature film, certain (often misguided) decisions are made, usually about fleshing out the characters' backstories or bringing their antics to life in \"the real world\". With DUDLEY DO-RIGHT (1999), the questionable choice has been made to make Dudley, Snidely, and Nell childhood buddies who've grown into their adult roles as the hero, the villain, and the damsel, respectively. The awkward prologue sets up the main characters so that the movie can get the ball rolling right after the animated opening credits.Originally appearing as self-contained backup segments within episodes of Rocky & Bullwinkle cartoons, \"Dudley Do-Right\" and its characters have their roots in the serialized melodramas of early silent films. The cartoons are steeped in such iconography as the mustache-twirling villain tying the damsel to the railroad tracks (or a sawmill, etc.), the jaunty piano accompaniment, and the irising camera and old-timey title cards that introduce each character. Dudley is a spoof of the brave and pure hero: a well-meaning and idealistic buffoon, who somehow (often in spite of himself) brings the bad guys to justice.Brendan Fraser plays Dudley as a slapstick dimwit who is as much a victim of his environment (for example, stepping on loose floor boards in his cabin) as he is of his own na\u00efvet\u00e9. He's a rather bland hero, rigidly devoted to his sense of right and wrong and hopelessly idealistic (not so much a ridiculous caricature as his cartoon counterpart). This builds a sense of sympathy for the poor guy, which was never really part of the cartoon iteration. Likewise, Nell (Sarah Jessica Parker) is fleshed out as a comically well-educated Yale and Harvard graduate (and former U.S. Ambassador to Guam), and not just a fickle frontier maiden who toys with Dudley's heart. Alfred Molina seems to have fun with his role as the dastardly Snidely Whiplash, playing it as cartoony as he can, and it works. (The character of Horse, the horse, doesn't add much and is largely absent from the film.)The action is propelled by the wonderful, pseudo-serious narration (by Corey Burton, in the style of Paul Frees), which takes a page right from the original cartoons. But the film makes the odd choice of setting the action in the modern day (since the cartoon from the 1960s was very specifically spoofing old-timey silent movies and a late-19th-Century setting). It's just a little odd to see Dudley standing next to a modern SUV, or to have the mustachioed Snidely watching cable news. The mix of antiquated iconography and contemporary trappings is bizarre, but I suppose that's part of the film's charm. (At least we don't get a completely modernized take on the characters.)The plot has the sinister Snidely Whiplash incite a false gold rush on his own Canadian land, bringing waves of Americans (and their wallets) over the border. Dudley faces a crisis of conscience when it's pointed out that Snidely's \"wrong-doing\" is actually good for the Canadian economy, and that sometimes in order to stop the \"bad guy\", a \"good guy\" has to be a little bad. (The scenes where Dudley is a \"dangerous\", motorcycle-riding, vigilante \"bad boy\" offer an interesting role-reversal with his nemesis Snidely, but stretch the character a little too far from his fumbling Mountie image.)Despite the criticisms, DUDLEY DO-RIGHT is fun because it embraces its cartoon roots. The film is very stylized, from the portrayals of the characters to the voice-over narration to the occasional fourth wall breaks to the veins of absurdity that run through the whole thing (Snidely's merchandising empire, the faux-Native American theatrical performances, Eric Idle's prospector bum-turned-wise mentor). Although the story was transported to the modern world, the filmmakers didn't tamper too much with the spirit of the source material. The narration is on-point, Snidely's goons have some funny lines, and Molina's colorful portrayal of the villain (with his alternate outfits for playing mini-golf and leading a battalion to war) makes the film worthwhile.When I saw the movie it was preceded by an animated \"Fractured Fairy Tales\" short, THE PHOX, THE BOX, & THE LOX (1999), which was a pleasant surprise and a pitch-perfect recreation of the old cartoons from Rocky & Bullwinkle (down to the vocal sound-alikes for Edward Everett Horton and Daws Butler, and the actual participation of June Foray).",

            "content": "My five year old adored Brendan Fraser in Disney's \"George of the Jungle.\" I loved the movie too, and we saw it a total of nine times over the four months it ran at local theatres in the summer of 1998. We now own on it DVD; it was the first one we ever purchased, and its publication prompted us to buy the player for my computer, in fact. What made \"George of the Jungle\" so great was that Disney remained true to character of the cartoon George and built an exciting and well-written plot around a very fine performance by one of the cutest actors to ever come out of Hollywood. My son and I would sit in the theatre and laugh ourselves silly as joke after joke had the kids and parents rolling in the aisles. George was sweet, funny, and (for the moms) very, very sexy. You could see Fraser's talent and intelligence shining through in places and the result was incredibly likeable.Unfortunately, Fraser's Dudley is less than stupid, inconsistently clumsy, and completely lacking in any charm whatsoever. I think that Fraser's underlying intelligence actually works against his moronic character, and despite playing opposite a convincing Snidely Whiplash, Fraser's performance is frankly- horrible! I'm not sure if it's Fraser's fault, though. What can anyone do, no matter how much he dimples, to win over an audience to what has to be the most inconsistently developed and poorly written characters of all time? One moment we are asked to love Dudley for his clumsiness and purity of heart. Then we are asked to applaud Do Right's transition into a machine gun toting biker bad boy who is suddenly and inexplicably traipsing about (in an animal skin loincloth, no less) like a Solid Gold dancer. (And of the Native American musical: just how does one clog in moccasins and bare feet? Even the sound effects in the film were senseless.)I wasn't the only one who hated the film, either. Bored with trying to read my son's Batman comic book during light scenes, I looked around sometime near the middle of the movie to find kids fidgeting in their seats and parents yawning. A few adults were close to tears with boredom and I noticed that precisely at 8:20, when there was still time to grab tickets for the next showing of \"A Dog in Flanders\", almost half of the audience left the theatre. I grabbed our things, but my son, excited to see Fraser again, made me stay. How I came to envy those parents with children less stubborn than my own! Only twice I heard laughter, and once I joined in. There were a total of four clever lines in the film, in the scene where Dudley is being trained to be bad by some innocuous dirty miner who simply shows up for no discernible reason. He tells George \"Now, say\u0085 I am dangerous.\" Dudley replies, \"You are dangerous.\" The miner makes a face and says, \"No, say you are dangerous.\"\n\"I already said that.\" says Dudley.This is almost as clever as the repartee between Bugs and Daffy in the episodes where they vie to convince Elmer which of them he should shoot, but Warner can certainly sustain this kind of thing longer (and I don't have to shell out over twelve dollars for my son and myself to see it.) With Dudley things simply went from bad to worse and culminated into a cinematic experience that I found even more disgusting than that hitherto greatest of all celluloid stink-bombs, \"Highlander 2\". You would think that such a simplistic character as a bungling Canadian Mountie could have translated fairly easily onto the big screen. What's not to understand about Dudley? He's drawn in simple lines, has predictable dialogue and only comes in three colours. Yet Disney managed to fail utterly. They even misunderstood Nell, if you can believe that this version of the irritating little blonde has a string of graduate degrees and then has trouble deciding if she should choose Snidely over Dudley. Of course, this Dudley was so lame that he did make Snidely look good, but I still think that two hours of re-runs of the cartoons would have been more entertaining than the plot-less wonder I was forced to see till its end. Not only did the movie fail to portray Do Right within any scope of reasonable resemblance, but they went on to change what the filmmakers obviously did not understand. If you make Dudley bad, or graceful, you completely lose any coherence in his character. He simply doesn't make sense any more and that's not amusing, that's punishment for parents whose children won't allow them to leave early. In sum, although my five year old defends the film, it is this adult's perspective that \"this movie sucks like a tornado, eh.\" I truly hated it. If Fraser doesn't get himself a new agent and do some better work, I don't know how I can take my son see another one of the travesties on film that he's been getting himself caught up in. For shame Disney, for shame, what you did to that wonderful young man (and to your audience)!",

Unfortunately, that's not the case at all. While the two movies share a couple of the same producers they don't share directors or writers. \"Dudley Do-Right\" was directed and written by Hugh Wilson who directed/wrote the amusing \"Blast from the Past,\" which came out six months before \"Do Right.\" As such, you would think \"Do-Right\" would be a decent goofy comedy, but it's not. It's starts off with an overlong, irrelevant and pointless cartoon and never recovers. The zany jokes fall flat except for a couple and this is from someone who enjoys stoo-pid humor.What's utterly amazing is that \"Do-Right\" cost a whopping $70 million in 1999 dollars. \"Blast from the Past\" only cost half that much and \"George of the Jungle\" (1997) $15 million less (than \"Do-Right\")! Where'd all the money go? You certainly don't see it on the screen or in the writing. Of course, Fraser is likable and fitting as Dudley and Molina eats up the role of Whiplash, but their jokes are lame and unfunny. Parker might have worked, but she's underutilized. Really, the only sequences that perked my attention are the Native American theater scenes and, in the third act, when Dudley morphs into a bad dude to beat Whiplash, but even these scenes aren't anything to write home about.Simply put, \"Dudley Do-Right\" is a DUD.The film runs 77 minutes and was shot in British Columbia and Santa Clarita, CA.GRADE: D",

I believe a number of jokes could be made at the fact that it failed to recoup roughly eighty-six percent of its $70,000,000 budget. I seem to have an ounce of sympathy for the fact that numerous talents such as Brendan Fraser, Sarah Jessica Parker, and director Hugh Wilson in such a desperation for a quick-fix or a cash-grab that they needed to make a film based off a character I'm sure American audiences could've stomached not seeing again. So making a joke from this material seems sort of beneath me; at any rate, the fact that a studio and investors spent $70,000,000 on a Dudley Do-Right movie is a joke in itself.I can't remember the last time it was such a chore for me to sit through a seventy-seven minute movie. I became so restless that I couldn't even focus. You know how the new theater trend that is slowly emerging is autistic-friendly theaters, which are theaters that lack previews, remain a bit lighter during the show, are a tad quieter, and blunt movement and conversation is allowed, even encouraged? That kind of theater experience should've been a standard for Dudley Do-Right during its initial release. To expect an audience to remain silent during this under normal theater conditions is an act of pure torture. The only way I could've remained silent is if I slept.Preceding the film is a short called \"The Phox, the Box, and the Lox,\" which involves a conniving Phox tricks a bone-headed Lox into opening a box that states whoever opens this will die to recover the treasure inside. This short only lasts about five minutes and it's a drag to sit through. How infrequently do I see a film with a preceding trailer that maintains the same sort of mood and effect that its successor will soon have.The film focuses on our title character, of course, a Canadian Mountie played by Brendan Fraser, who is often victim to his naivety and do-right attitude about everything life has to offer. His childhood friend Snidely (Alfred Molina) now has ambitions to take over the area where Dudley works, resulting in one of the biggest gold schemes in history. Dudley teams up with his childhood crush Nell (Sarah Jessica Parker) in an effort to spoil Snidley's plans at success and domination.Does this sound like the kind of gripping tale you want to let yourself and your children indulge in? Why on earth would you take them to see this film? Passing entertainment? Something to do because it's wet outside? It looks harmless enough? It's for their own benefit? Wrong, wrong, wrong. I consistently hear that obesity is a form of child abuse and constantly feeding your kid unhealthy food should result in some of punishment for the parent. So should taking them to view Dudley Do-Right, which is about as unhealthy and unsubstantial as a pack of Hostess cupcakes.Brendan Fraser, who sporadically appears in a film worth watching, must be given credit here for persevering through a role that is as unforgiving as a roadside mascot for a car company. The extremely high budget suggests he was compensated well, but his dignity was left undernourished as we see him victim to horse-farts, blows to the head, blows to the ego, etc. It gets beyond monotonous. How many times can you watch the same joke be repeated before you, as the helpless viewer, throw your arms up in utter defeat? I have never seen the Dudley Do-Right shorts that spawned this film and, much like after I watched the Scooby-Doo film adaptation, I have no plan to now. However, from a relatively quick glance, they seem like the kind of drudgery that was undoubtedly boosted in quality by how much sugar was in a young boy or girl's system. I don't believe any amount of sugar could make this film more bearable than it is.Dudley Do-Right is not a funny movie by any stretch of imagination. Its exposition is tired and facile, its self-referential toilet humor is ridiculous and redundant, its actors succumb themselves to some of the driest material, the sight-gags are routine, and its hero is so dreadfully incompetent that one wants to show him the way to the wardrobe for a costume change and into the breakroom.Starring: Brendan Fraser, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Alfred Molina.

Here, they are not at all successful doing the same thing with \"Duddey Do-Right.\"  The biggest problem is the storyline. Dudley is jaw-dropping dumb when he is being \"good,\" yet clever and resourceful when he is being bad(???) In the show, Nell was nearly as thick as Dudley.  Here, she is brilliant but shallow. Now, let's get to the casting.  Brendan Fraser looks all wrong for Dudley and doesn't do the voice (I understand he can).  Sarah Jessica Parker is just as bad as Nell.  Only Alfred Molina as Snidely really captures his character.  One could imagine a much better \"Dudley Do-Right\" with Casper Van Dien and Kate Winslet, even with this awful writing. Just about the only thing that works in this thing besides Molina is the Kumquat \"River Dance\" parody.  However, the choreography is excellent, more in fitting with a \"straight\" film rather than a spoof.Most certainly, \"DudLey Do-Right\" is a genuine \"dud.\"",

            "content": "DUDLEY DO-RIGHT (1999) *Starring: Brendan Fraser,  Sarah Jessica Parker, Alfred Molina, Robert Prosky Written and directed by Hugh Wilson   aprox  90minutes   Rated PG (for comic slapstick violence)By Blake French:\tIn a particular scene featured in the new comedy \"Dudley Do-Right,\" one of the characters states something funny; \"That's not fair, they have rocks--all we have are machine guns.\" That dialogue is witty, sassy and irresistible. Unfortunately, it is expressed by the film's villain. Cute, likeable remarks like that should be used to develop the good guy, especially if the good guy is Dudley Do-Right. The hero himself here is given no funny one-liners or likeable traits that train the audience except him as the happy go lucky protagonist. In result of giving the antagonist all the good material, I ended up rooting for the bad guy. The filmmakers seem to notice this concept and in result, for most of the production, the bad guy is the good guy and the good guy is the bad guy. Doesn't make much sense, does it. But movies like \"Dudley Do-Right\" have such little clue about what they are or where they are going, that this flaw is only the beginning of its troubles. The movie opens with three young kids playing together in a yard. One says that he wants to be a good hearted law enforcer one day. Another explains that he wants to be the villain, and takes the third, a girl whom they both have a crush on, and rides away on his bike after smashing a chocolate ice cream cone on the deputy wannabe's head. The characters grow up and become what they have always dreamed of being. Dudley Do-Right is a proud appointee living out in the country with his horse named horse. His old sweetheart, Nell Fenwick, knocks on his door one day. They sing each other a song. Romantic flares gloom.\nEverything is going well in Dudley's life until his old bully acquaintance, Snidely Whiplash, starts to deal out a sinister plan involving a false good rush, vampires, and blackmail--all which make Mr. Whiplash look like the good guy, and eventually turn Dudley into a bad guy--sort of. \t Already the plot is too deep for this kind of movie. Most of the cartoons which \"Dudley Do-Right\" is based on were simply and zany. The story is mostly explained to us by a comically annoying narrator who uses shapeless, undisciplined humor to provoke laughs in order to distract us from his bothersome presence. And to add some more proof of this film's plot failure, it is very hollow: it never allows us to become involved simply because there is such little substance to it. No depth...just a bunch of nonsense characters doing screwball things to each other. \tAnother thing I found to the awful creditably to \"Dudley Do Right\" is the amazing lack of high energy excitement involved with the story, like that which was found earlier this year in movies like \"Inspector Gadget\" and \"My Favorite Martian.\" I was astonished with how little energy this movie actually had. Don't let the film's trailer or advertisements confuse you; this movie has such little excitement in it that I would still find it difficult to recommend to the youngest of children, it just won't hold their attention. And the few scenes that did energy felt stained and tired. \tThere are a few funny moments in \"Dudley Do-Right,\" most of which come from concepts or ideas that are recycled and repeated. Coming from the creators of the dreadful \"George of the Jungle,\" (1997) the film obviously offers the same kind of humor repeatedly--Dudley hits his head on a floor board about a half dozen times throughout the production. Regardless, the laugh inspiring material here is not enough to even waste a dime on.I liked the performance from Alfred Molina, as the villain, Snidely Whiplash. He offered the kind of character needed in \"Big Daddy,\" which was starved for a bad guy. Brendan Fraser has been in several movies this year, without even having a hit. \"Blast From the Past\" failed in the box office, \"The Mummy\" was unconvincing, and now, this flop, which is such a useless worthless waste of time it doesn't even know how to develop its main hero, and the tittle is taken from his name. At times in this film Dudley Do-Right asks his horse for advice in life threatening situations and at others he blasts his initials in a fortress with a tommy gun he is beholding. Its is too serious for kids and too childish for adults. All of this and one wonders why Disney did not bring us this family entertainment--after all, it seems like their style. I think they probably were offered this film, but had higher standards than it. Universal bought the rights, along with the pain and suffering they will most likely feel long after the reviews and box office totals are in. They will have to live with their decision--for the rest of their lives. Brought to you by Universal Pictures.",

Brendan Fraser plays Dudley Do-Right, a Royal Canadian Mountie and together with his horse named Horse he will attempt to reclaim the dignity he lost when the evil Whiplash took over the land. Lame and predictable with the same appeal as an episode of Sesame Street. Misfire by director Hugh Wilson who at one time made hilarious comedies such as Police Academy and Blast From the Past, the latter featuring Fraser is a less embarrassing role. Fraser overplays a joke involving falling off a chair. That doesn't help the fact that Do-Right is totally unsympathetic due to his juvenile stupidity. Alfred Molina brings correct humour to the role of Whiplash and becomes the one character of worth here. He basically takes over and Do-Right eventually stops him. Sarah Jessica Parker plays off the humour as the otherwise standard damsel. In a broader role Parker would shine but here the role is a dud playing off every lame clich\u00e9 within reach and never surfacing as anything she should have been a part of. Eric Idle is wasted as a gold digger who teaches Do-Right the ropes. There is no purpose to this junk other than to resurrect a T.V. cartoon into a poorly contrived crap fest. Score: 1/2 / 10",

So I usually approach live-action versions of same with caution - usually justified (not least if they're made by Universal, whose track record in making big-screen versions of TV shows leaves something to be desired; like \"Leave it to Beaver\" and \"McHale's Navy\" [but unlike \"The Flintstones\" and \"Jetsons: The Movie,\" alas] this one skipped UK cinemas and went directly to video). \"Dudley Do-Right\" is no exception.Written and directed by Hugh Wilson of \"Police Academy\" and \"WKRP In Cincinnati\" fame (which should be enough for some people), the film's merciful lack of length is one of its few real virtues; unlike the delightful \"George of the Jungle,\" the makers have no real affection for the source -  not only is the movie set in the present day, but Nell actually returns Dudley's love (as fans of the cartoon character know, she always preferred his horse) - with tiresome slapstick, flatulence jokes, unamusing cracks about how Americans and Canadians view each other, and even machine-guns and a motorcycle chase thrown in.Even Brendan Fraser's appeal can't save this one; Alfred Molina's Snidely Whiplash is a help, but not enough; and as for Sarah Jessica \"I'm not going to stand next to Britney Spears and look even worse than I usually do\" Parker's Nell Fenwick... no. But there is one truly good sequence: the Fractured Fairy Tales cartoon that precedes the movie. It's much funnier than the main attraction, and gives you a taste of the real thing to boot.

When Eric Idle can't even get a laugh, that's another reason for downvoting. The storyline surrounds a gold strike in the northern part of Canada and Snidely's attempts to cash in. The script can't even begin to capture the irreverent flow of the original series, and even with a \"Fractured Fairy Tale\" short at the beginning (which is much better than anything that follows), all the charm of the Rocky and Bullwinkle series as well as all of the other characters that came out of it is lost.

I doubt that this prestigious corporation took too kindly to the unwanted publicity, but these considerations aside, and that slight sense of arrogant US superiority over its northern neighbor, the film is simply not funny.The best that this film has to give us is the quality of the actors, starting with Brendan Fraser. The actor commits himself, does what he can, but doesn't have decent material to work with. Sara Jessica Parker also does an enjoyable job playing the idiotic hero's dorky girlfriend, and Alfred Molina is just as good. The problem is that the actors, regardless of the effort and individual commitment, received miserable material from the screenwriter, who instead of giving a competent script, delivered a miserable and amateur sketch.If we exclude the good quality of the actors and their enormous effort to work, the film is a total disgrace. The dialogue is miserable, and the jokes rely on pure cheap slapstick or high school scatological humor. The technical aspects aren't brilliant either, and the film looks very cheap.",

            "review_title": "Likable actors, but not goofy enough to work as a cartoon remake",
            "content": "The movie is earnest, and fairly well done from a technical standpoint, but it falls short of the intense goofiness of the original TV cartoons. Placed as a recurring feature within the weekly cartoon series, The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, the original Dudley Do-Right cartoons relied mostly on a few running gags: Dudley's unimpeachable honesty and allegiance to 19th century Canadian Mountie ideals, as well as his innocent love and preference for his faithful horse over his erstwhile girlfriend Nell. Snidely Whiplash's angst and concern over his role as a villain, and how he continually monitors his behavior to gauge his success at being evil was absurd and amusing. The James Mason-ish Inspector Fenwick, who maintained the same oily yet dry British upper class drawl whether he was giving orders to Dudley to counter Snidely's latest attempt to take over Canada, congratulating Dudley on a job well done, or stripping Dudley of his rank because he fell victim to one of Whiplash's set-ups or hoaxes was also great. It was all done in broad strokes, as caricatures of the social roles defining law and order, criminality, authority, the media itself, and gender. It was funny, it was sly, and at about three minutes per week it was just enough.The movie, on the other hand, falls short in the cartoonishness necessary to make the Dudley Do-Right elements entertaining. Dudley was underplayed by the otherwise brilliant Brandon Fraser. He came across as likable and honest, but was too close to reality to be particularly funny. Nell seemed more flaky than romantically frustrated, as the cartoon had her. Maybe that was a bow to modern feminism, but it deprived the character of the contrast and drama that used to be funny. What was left, and now visible on the screen, was just \"a blond lady.\" Nell's father, Inspector Fenwick, was so blank as to be a non-character. That James Mason-ish hold-the-empire-together, and close-your-eyes-and-think-of-Britain droll absurdity from the original cartoon would have been easy enough to bring to the movie screen, but this movie didn't even try. Remakes and re-enactments don't need to be models of exactitude, of course. But if not a reprint of the original, a remake does need to conjure up a similar vibe.Fraser's other Jay Ward movie re-enactment, George Of the Jungle, was a much better job. It worked both as a movie itself, and as a faithful re-do of Ward's original. It evoked the TV cartoon series, thus satisfying nostalgia and all of that for the fans, yet it also did what movies need to do to grab and entertain the actual folks currently sitting in the theater. Dudley Do-Right missed this. During the showing I attended, I think I chuckled twice and laughed twice, each time hearing a handful of adult voices with mine. A couple of times I heard children's small little voices laughing-- each when someone got hit in the head and fell down. This wasn't enough. It needed to be much more of a movie to watch and enjoy independently of any remake or nostalgia vibe. George of the Jungle was a movie first, and a remake second. Dudley Do-Right was, on the whole, pretty much just a remake, and not a great one at that. I gave it a 6, even though I was really hoping it could have been much more.",

            "review_title": "Dudley Do Quite Right Indeed!",
            "content": "I feel somewhat pity for Jay Ward, the cartoon genius who essentially created the tongue-in-cheek joke for kids.  He has missed out on the fruits of his work turning into great live-action movies.Upon entering the theater, I felt hesitant.  The trailers seemed to show only a broad slap-stick side to Dudley (getting hit on the head one too many times).  If the movie was unable to recapture the silly mood of it's predesessor, it would be a total failure.  Call me a skeptic if you wish, but I was expecting the worst.  Thankfully, I was wrong.  Dudley was a fine ol' comedy that is great for adults but perfect for kids.In case you don't know, Dudley Do-Right was a cartoon created by Jay Ward. Dudley was a idiot Canadian Mountie who was always rescuing his beloved Nell from the evil Snidely Whiplash.  He's tie her to the railroad tracks, he's someone end up saving her.  But in the process, Dudley's antics (along with a sarcastic narrator) left you rolling in stitches.The movie tells the tale of Dudley (Brendan Fraser)and his evil counterpart Snidley (Alfred Molina). Snidley has been planting gold in \"them thar hills\" of Semi-Happy Valley in Canada.  When a prospector by the name of Kim Darling (Eric Idle) finds this gold, it turns into the biggest gold rush ever, turns Semi-Happy Valley into Whiplash City, and do to a mistaken case of vampires and government conspiracy (thanks to Snidley), leaves our hero kicked out of the Mounties!  And to top it all off for poor Dudley, Nell Fenwick (Sarah Jessica Parker) has fallen for Snidley and Horse, his horse (played by McFly, no lie), has run off!!!  So Dudley must become bad to out bad Snidley's bad which has turned the delapitated town into a thriving community which is good.  Confused?  Well, it's not that tough.\"Dudley Do-Right\", while overall very similar to the cartoon, is also very different.  The saddest part to me is that Dudley had the voice of Brendan Fraser and not something closer to his original tone, which is a shame because Fraser did the voice on \"The Daily Show With Jon Stewart\" and he was perfect.  Another difference is that while Nell was helpless and in love with Dudley in the cartoon, in the movie she seems to love Snidley more often and in a woman of the world.  This added part to her character makes us not like the character at all.  \"If Dudley doesn't get the girl, lucky him!\"Now on to the good parts of the movie.  The plot zips by at a frantic speed, slowing down for all the good parts. You get just enough of the story to know what's going on and then onto the jokes.  And laughs there are a plenty.  While there is plenty of that aformentioned slapstick, it thankfully is gone after the first 20 minutes.  Once you get to the Indian Dance number, you're home free.One of the better gags in the movie involves the indian tribe of the Kumquat nation (all of them apparrently straight from New York).  The Chief (Alex Rocco) owns a dinner theater complete with a musical extravaganza and fireworks.  If you thought the native american shows you've seen were kind of hokey, wait till you see the Kumquat nation \"Riverdance\".  Another good riff is when the prospector receives his fifteen minutes of fame...on Live with Regis and Kathy Lee (yes, you get to see his appearance).  Once he becomes a bum again, he goes around uttering \"I was on Regis and Kathy Lee\" and \"I know Bette Midler personally\" (no, you don't get to see her appearance).But Kim Darling, the prospector isn't just there for a joke or two.  When Dudley becomes fired, Kim takes Dudley under his wing and turns him into a great hero following three steps \"We'll start with two, for the sake of consistency: 2. trust, 1. bravery, and 3. instinct.\"  The training may be the oddest thing ever and remember, this is Eric Idle of Monty Python fame, so somehow, it seems even funnier with him in it.Of course, the best gag is shown in the trailer, but I'll mention it anyway. Dudley, in his first bad doing, steals Snidley's gold he's going to place. Then he leaves a little message for him ala Dick Tracy with a machine gun. He leaves his initials \"D.D.\".  Snidley, in a fit of anger, yells \"Do you have any idea what this could possibly mean?\"  The replies include Doris Day, Dom Deluise, Daniel Day Lewis, Snoop Doggy Dogg, David Duchovney and another name, which I won't tell to ruin the punchline.One odd little note is that Fraser did \"The Mummy\" before \"Dudley Do-Right\" and it seems to show.  In several occasions, he jumps into action star mode (one that suits him well).  Especially during a strangely thrilling motorcycle race that is very reminicent of \"Return of the Jedi\"'s swoop bike scene but only with a bit more humor.  The action is very intense for a kid flick and it's choice of music to get you in the mood(not during the scene), \"Born to be Wild\" on classic instruments, seems to work.(A quick message here.  Right before the movie is a cartoon of \"Fractured Fairytales\".  This cartoon, entitlted \"The Phox, The Box, and The Lox\" was so enjoyable, it makes you wonder why Universal doesn't start making more new cartoons for it's movies.  Or how about bringing them back to a TV show?)As for the ending of the movie, it leaves you feeling content yet yearning for more.  You can't help but wish there had been more or maybe something during the credits.  Do you hear that Universal, when \"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle\" comes out, there better be gags in the credits!  As for \"Dudley Do-Right\", it may not be \"George of the Jungle\", but it's so close you could swear you see him.  And yes, before you start E-mailing me about it, I know.",

The film was a huge box office bomb and it's easy to see why, my first question is how the hell did they spend 70 million on this film? At no stage can you see the value on the screen, it looks like everybody loaded their pockets and phoned it in. The narration is utterly useless and uninspiring, why they kept this is beyond me. The whole idea of this film is crazy and you can see why this film failed. Who was the audience of this film? They don't appear to be aiming strictly at children but the humour is low brow, so immature that it's tough yo watch. They needed more pulp humour and a more focused director in charge, massive disappointment. 10-11-2017.",

While it does have a few funny jokes like Snidely Whiplash convinces Dudley he was hunting for vampires as an excuse for shooting golden bullets in an abandon mine shaft to make money off of prospectors, most of the jokes and gags don't really work as most of it is either outdated slapstick, fart humor, and a reference to Pokemon (you hear right, a Pokemon reference).",

The evil friend succeeds in his schemes until Dudley is fired as a Mountie and forced to beat his foe at his own games (Dudley meets a man who mentors him - in the tradition of Karate Kid and similar films).  The Mounties come to his aid and the natives as they are attacked by the enemy and his gang.  Sarah Jessica Parker is surprising at times, even appealing, as Nell.  6/10",

Universal tried to cash in on the success of Disney's \"George of the Jungle\" adaption with Brendan Fraser by putting him in a theatrical adaption of another Jay Ward (creator of \"George of the Jungle\") toon, \"Dudley Do-Right\".\r\n\r\nThe film felt like a quest to find a plot! The film is about a clumsy mountie named Dudley Do-Right (because he's always doing right!) who must stop his long time nemesis, Snidley Whiplash, from taking over Semi-Happy Valley. The rest is just a whole bunch of plot threads who were abused by hardly being developed.\r\n\r\nFraser is doing what he does best: acting weirdly. So I consider him to be the best actor in the film. Alfred Molina speaks in a annoying cartoonish voice. It worked sometimes at got out of hand for the remainder. Sarah Jessica Parker was acting terribly. She looked like the thought, \"I'm getting paid for this, right?\", ran through her head throughout her screen time. Supporting cast: LAME! Not even Eric Idle helped.\r\n\r\nThe humor is so flat! Eric Idle was not funny and so was Alfred Molina. Not even the \"Pokemon\" reference helped! When I did find something amusing, I replied with dry chcukles. I just wonder how much they paid the writer, Hugh Wilson. The other stupid thing was the opening credits. The titles, \"Written by Hugh Wilson\" and \"Directed by Hugh Wilson\", are seperate. Were they just too lazy to put \"Written for the screen and directed by Hugh Wilson\"? Laziness, people! Laziness! The film was even unsure of itself. It felt and anachronistic and bored of itself. The film was just lazy. It was flat, lazy, and supplied very little to children. Low on slapstick. What a shame. \"Dudley Do-Right\" is a do-wrong. The \"George of the Jungle\" movie was more butch and that live-action \"Flintstones\" movie had more dignity than this. Come on, Hollywood! Come on!",
