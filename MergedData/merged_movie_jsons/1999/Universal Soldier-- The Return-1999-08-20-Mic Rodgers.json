            "review_title": "Underrated Science Fiction-Action Packed solid sequel Van Damme flick!",
            "content": "Universal Soldier: The Return (1999) in my opinion is the most underrated, bashed, hated solid sequel flick that I absolutely Love and one of my favorite movies in the franchise! After the success of the first film Universal Soldier (1992) directed from Roland Emmerich, there were two TV movies directed who were suppose to be a mini series and they were all canceled. Universal Soldier II: Brothers in Arms (1998) and Universal Soldier III: Unfinished Business (1999) Starring Matt Battaglia as Luc Devereaux / GR44 and Chandra West as Veronica Roberts. Jean-Claude Van Damme had a strict policy not to make any sequels, but after 7.years later, he decide to make the sequel to the Universal Soldier, which he did make this film and it was his last movie released in the movie theater until JCVD (2008). I know this movie has flaws, because Luc Devereaux (Van Damme) is human and he his a daughter. Universal Soldiers can't have a children wow. That it was a bad acting and so on. I disagree with all of the haters, Regeneration and Day of Reckoning are even worst than The Return. Because they ruined the beloved character Luc Deveraux. I like Regeneration but not so much as I love The Return. I hate Day of Reckoning, I am thinking, it is the worst film in the franchise for Van Damme, only him been in a 7 mins. in the film, that was lame. I don't know why so many people hate this movie with critics & box office failure? In my opinion this movie is one of my all time favorites and it deserved to be one of the best Van Damme movies ever. I've always had fun with this one. Very fast paced, lots of action, cool fights, good soundtrack, and Van Damme acting with a smile on his face. I don't think this movie is bad, I love the original move to death and I love this one too. In here you have Van Damme acting with his smile on his face and he does care and has a heart in it. I like the new generation of Unisols, I thought they were pretty good, the fights were weary fast paced. This movie had a Personality and kept you entertained all the time. This one has Michael Jai White in it, he did a solid perfect acting performance as S.E.T.H. He was the soldier in the opening scene in Universal Soldier, I am happy he returned to the sequel with a different character playing in here. This one has Bill Goldberg in it as another UniSol soldier, who becomes enemy of Luc Deveraux. \nThis movie isn't the greatest flick ever made, nor is it as good as Universal Solider for me. But it is still a fun flick regardless, and much better than the horrible direct to video sequels, and it is without a doubt ten times better than the awful sequels that came before it that aired on Showtime starring Matt Bataglia who can't even act let alone fight. This film has a bad ass soundtrack, some bad ass fights, and it is a fast paced fun movie that was a lot of fun to watch. I like my Universal Soldier films to have Van Damme kicking ass, and smiling at the same time. Not falling asleep while watching stupid monkeys or acting like Col. Kurtz. This flick offers that kind of high-intensity sci-fi action you've come to expect from Van Damme in a story you won't soon forget. There are much worse Van Damme flicks than Universal Soldier: The Return and much worse action movies as well. Hell half the action films released in the past few years can't even hold this movie's jock. Abduction with Taylor Lautner from Twilight gets a 5.0 and there is no way in hell that is a better action movie than this. I would much rather watch this fun, fast paced sequel than Terminator: Genisys or any reboot movie of the week. If anything, this is underrated and not worth the overwhelming amount of pure crap the film has gotten over the years. It isn't a Shakespeare folks. Hell, the first film wasn't either. It was just as silly at points and as over the top as this was. Day Of Reckoning makes this film's tone and style look like Mary Poppins and that gets a higher rating and more praise from people. I wish more movies were like this one today, especially from Van Damme. Honestly in my opinion I do care a lot about Van Damme he is my idol and I am very happy he did made a sequel to the original movie. The rating I am giving to this underrated hateful sequel is a 7, I am probably the only one who likes this movie.",

            "content": "Regular follow-up in which Luc Deveraux and other \"universal soldiers\" must fight the whole army when then the military's supercomputer S.E.T.H gets out of control , as soldiers have been secretly reanimated , upgraded and leading a riot , threatening to unleash a world rebellion . Original \u00a8Universal soldier\u00a8 was followed by this \u00a8Universal soldier : the return\u00a8 with a good cast as Jean-Claude Van Damme , Michael Jai White , Heidi Schanz , Xander Berkeley and Justin Lazard ; however , subsequently Universal Soldier films ignore the events of The Return and outright contradict it in a number of ways ; while still an official entry, it is no longer considered part of the series canon . With top-secret technology, the SETH -2001's Hall 2000 alike- , has created a next-generation Universal Soldier , an elite fighter genetically altered into a programmable killing machine , forming a tough army of genetically enhanced warriors . SETH is preparing to government overthrow and build a new order ruled by Unisols without state control . Although former \"UniSol\" Luc Deveraux (Jean Claude Van Damm , also producer) and other staff members as Xander Berkeley playing Dr. Dylan Cotner and Daniel Von Bargen as General Radford , all of them attempt to prevent the revolt . The only one who can stop to UniSol 2500 (Bill Goldberg following his return from a six-month absence from wrestling , though this character was originally intended for WWF wrestler \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin) and the same SETH personified into a bouncer UniSol (Michael Jai White who also appeared in the original ,1992, as a soldier) results to be Deveraux . SETH looks to take down Luc Deveraux after a hospital invasion claims his daughter . The fight pits Romeo/2500 and an army of genetically enhanced soldiers ; meanwhile, Deveraux must contend with several UniSols in relentless pursuits . He must make a full-out assault on the heavily armed headquarter . But inside, Deveraux'll discover these virtually indestructible warriors . Now, these elite fighters led by SETH are loaded and programmed to kill ; and the fate of millions hinges on this high-action showdown . This moving picture contains noisy action , chills , shootouts and fierce combats in brutal , life-and-death style . This exciting story being based on the characters created by Christopher Leitch and Dean Devlin . From start to finish the action is unstoppable and frenetic . Thrilling screenplay dispenses absurd excitement as well as violence and lots of fights . Breathtaking action movie full of struggles , crossfire and tension , this is a fast-paced, stylized action-suspense film , though mediocre . Thrilling screenplay by William Malone and John Fasano , they dispense absurd excitement as well as violence and lots of fights , creating some incredibly violent genre fare . Passable nail-biting movie full of struggles , crossfire and tension , this is a stylized action-suspense film , though there are some slow-moving scenes . The tension of this picture keeps snowballing as the clock ticks ever close for a groundbreaking as well as spectacular final . Jean-Claude Van Damme and Michael Jai White have some scenes together at an impressive fighting . Jean-Claude Van Damme and Billy Goldberg also have several action set-pieces together at some bloody confrontations . Acceptable production design , the strip club scene is filmed at The Clubhouse in Dallas, Texas , a legendary strip club , and certain subterranean scenes were filmed in Texas in the tunnels dug for the US' Superconducting Supercollider Project . It was released theatrically despite the previous sequels having been made-for-TV - a rarity for sequels . Atmospheric and fitted to action musical score by Don Davis .

This time Van Damme is helping to oversee a project involving a new batch of universal soldiers run by the government which is now being shut down. One new twist is that there is an intelligent computer system managing some part of the soldier's mental activity. Very reminiscent of Hal from \"2001\" as right away it seems, you know, overly savvy and smarmy. Mix in a pushy reporter, just like in the original, some explosives, a strip club brawl and loads of hand to hand combat and that's the movie. It borrowed many concepts from Terminator 2. Terrible dialog, even the one-liners were poorly written and there was zero tension, something the first one had along with some genuinely amusing scenes.",

            "review_title": "So bad it is entertaining",
            "content": "The mind boggles at exactly what about Universal Soldier merited a sequel. Since the real star, Dolph Lundgren, would not be able to reprise his role from the original, there is already scant reason to indulge oneself in this obvious tax write-off. Bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler Bill Goldberg and martial arts expert Michael Jai White. To their credit, they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement. Bill Goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film, and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role. For once, his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times, and it does not get irritating. The problem from the audience's point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor humility that makes Lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his films. And therein lies the problem. You do not go to see a Van Damme film because you want serious action. You go because you want comedy, however unintentional.Unbeknownst to many people, Universal Soldier was followed by two direct-to-video sequels. I have only seen the first, which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke. Matt Battaglia was so terrible in the role of Luc Deveraux that for once in his career, the sight of Jean-Claude Van Damme comes as a welcome relief. The film more or less completely disregards the stories of the aforementioned direct-to-video sequels, and instead begins a whole new story set an indeterminate time after the events of the original. After years of investigation and explanation, the Unisol project is still going ahead, with some minor modifications. For one, the new Unisols are stronger and more damage-resistant than their earlier cousins. For another, all of the Unisols are now under the direction of a supercomputer called SETH. In the early parts of the film, SETH exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass dome.Being that the film barely lasts more than eighty minutes, we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut. The Unisol project is on the chopping block, which essentially means that SETH will be turned off. SETH, somehow overhearing this conversation through means that are never really explained, decides to mobilise the Unisols as an army against those seeking to shut him down. His only problem is that every so often, a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic shutdown. Two individuals possess the code in question. SETH kills the first in short order, and those who are familiar with the plot kit that Van Damme's films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be. The rest of the film revolves around the Unisols' attempts to get the code out of Van Damme without injuring him too badly. A subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film, but it adds about as much to the story as Van Damme does to the profession of acting.The film is loaded to the brim with ridiculous lines and clich\u00e9s. When SETH transplants his command module into the body of Michael Jai White, we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over. He goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and mortality will be humanity's weakness(es). Gee, SETH, you mean they will not be our strong points? All kidding aside, the short length of the film is both the film's weakness and its strength. It leaves the action without adequate setup. In the original, we are given a very thorough explanation of the Unisols, how they work, and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film. Here, the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a Unisol is and how they operate. At least in the original, a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a tub of ice. Here, one of the villains is shot with a gun that leaves massive holes in his uniform (and presumably his body), getting up every time without stopping for breath.I tend to reserve the score of one for films that are so bad that they become entertaining in a completely unintentional manner. If you can see it on the cheap, knock yourself out. This is the kind of film that makes me mourn the loss of Mystery Science Theatre.",

Secondly, without Dolph Lundgren the first one would have been a bore. I guess you can sum this one up by saying that it was so bad that it was funny. Yes, this movie was hilarious. It made absolutely no sense, had no plot, just a bunch of stuff that happens and a bunch of people get blown up. For example this girl in the movie whom Luc just met like 3 hours ago at the most is telling him at the end of the movie that she can't live without him. PLEASE!!!

Van Damme's aging, but, still has the moves.  He's also a widower with a young daughter.First plot problem, his daughter has access to the \"Top Secret Project\" building for the Universal Soldier program, and uses it like a daycare center.  No other workers had their kids there, so what made her so special, except to put her closer to the action.Second plot problem, the female reporter.  She arrives for and interview, is excorted inside the factility, and when all hell breaks loose, she and her cameraman remain instead of being escorted out.  Another excuss to put a character close to the danger.Third plot problem, the irritating and unreal attitude the reporter has.  Instead of showing the least amount of fear over the killing and mayhem going on around her, she's doing her \"I-a-reporter-with-a-scoop\" dialogue.  I was hoping that Romeo or another soldier would take her out.Fourth plot problem, Kiana Tom, Van Damme's butt-kicking sidekick at the beginning of the movie, is left on the sidelines for most of the movie.  Her character replacing the reporter would have enhanced the whole story and added to the action.If you can overlook the plot problems, the show is at least bearable.",

            "content": "I must say when I first saw this movie I'd only seen bits of the first one and hadn't seen the 2nd or 3rd which are made for TV, so didn't really get the overall plot although I knew this one basically follows on from the 1st as it features Van Damme whilst the 2nd and 3rd don't, so I thought thats good enough for me.Anyway, I sat down and watched it and must say I was very, very impressed. Even though it barely lasts, (it goes on for just over an hour), I must say some of the action in this movie is truly spectacular and right up there with some of the best i've ever seen, and believe me I've seen a hell of a lot of action movies even though i'm only 16. In this movie there are some brilliant fights, gun fights, explosions (especially the one at the very end) and chases.Also Bill Goldberg is brilliant in his movie debut as the main Unisol, and Van-Damme (although slightly beginning to fade) is still preety much on top throughout. Heidi Schanz is also likable as his unlikely sidekick. I even chuckled at one or two rare comedy scenes in the movie. The plot is a bit weird and virtually the whole movie takes place over the space of one night, but if you want to watch a movie and be entertained or your a die-hard action fan, then this is the one for you. I found out on here that this movie was in the bottom 100 on IMDb, which is very unfair because as far as i'm concerned because there isun't a huge amount wrong with this movie and I've seen way worst movies than this. Actually, this isun't a bad movie at all.So I'm going to give this movie and 8 out of 10 because I was never bored, thoroughly entertained and it had some truly spectacular action scenes. My only complaint would be it being a little too short and a slightly better background on Van-Damme's character.",

I won't call this a sequel either cause it had almost nothing to do with the first one, so u didn't have to see the first one to understand this one. This was just a basic action shot em up flick, very violent, a lot more action in this one than the first one, but US 1 seemed a little more interesting than this one. Goldberg was ok in this movie much better than I expected though, and Michael Jai White was actually very good, man he can fight, good moves. Luckily though I didn't waste my money on this movie cause me and my friend had passes so we got in free. Overall this movie was good to go see if u are a die hard Van Damme fan or Universal Soldier fan, however the ending stank, it was the worst part of the movie, other than that, it wasn't a bad flick.",

It doesn't explain the first story, it only says that Luc(Van Damme) was one of the first uni sols. It then doesn't tell you about the new project, and how Luc became involved, also it says about the main female characture in the first, who is now his wife and is dead, how did she die?

The formula isn't Van Damme's alone but he's certainly the most prolific of the action movie stars.\tSilvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzennegger, Steven Segal, Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan are the best known of the action stars but with the exception of Chan, Van Damme is the one who seems to be still most actively in the business. And these sorts of films are much less popular than they used to be.\tJean-Claude is a terrible actor and his film world is simplistic. One can only assume that his fans wish that the real world was like his.The scenario almost invariably includes lots of hand to hand fighting, silly women and often children who need defending. The plots are stupid and concocted only to allow Jean-Claude to fight a lot and to show his sensitive side as he protects the women and/or children.\tThe mushy bits, accompanied by appropriate music, aren't ever romantic, Jean Claude could never manage that, but they serve to depict this action man as being a reluctant hero. He only beats people up, firstly because he can, but secondly because he has to.\tHis best film so far, of the ones I've seen, was the John Woo directed Hard Target (1993) which had many stylish touches, often in slow motion, which accentuated the admirable Van Damme gracefulness. \tI think the worst was Double Impact which unfortunately doubled the torture - there were two characters in the film played by the Muscles From Brussels.\tAnd the famous, universal, Van Damme bum shot, the scene where we get to see Jean-Claude's tastefully lit posterior, happens early on in Universal Soldier 2. So if you like you can leave early.\tUniversal Soldier follows the formula. Actually I think that his fans will like this one. There's plenty of kick boxing.",

            "content": "UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: THE RETURN / (1999) 1/2* (out of four)By Blake French:\t\"Universal Soldier: The Return\" is of the worst sequels released this decade, as clear and simple as that. The film is so riddled with mindless action sequences and inane character motives it is comparable to watching someone play a conventional video game in which the player must shoot down as many bad guys as possible before the time limit runs out. In the movie, hundreds of machine guns pick off countless characters before we even get the chance to learn their names. That kind of makes it an emotional feat when the tragic death of the old canine in \"My Dog Skip\" has greater impact than the death of a legion of fellow American's in this film, that plays like a mechanical stunt show.\t\"Universal Soldier: The Return\" begins with an action scene so perpetually lame I thought it was actually fake. I was right. The scene was a training session to test the skills of a selection of Universal Soldiers--combatants resurrected from the dead who are turned into a super duper fighting machine for top secret military purposes. One of the soldiers is Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme), who is helping to train a new breed of these combat weapons. A supercomputer called SETH controls the warriors, but when the universal solder program is to be shut down due to inconvenient budget cuts, SETH takes things into his own \"hands\" and destroys anyone in the way of its own plans of evolution. \tWhat story there is involves Jean-Claude Van Damme and other brainless characters running for their lives through high-tech laboratories and futuristic hallways within a massive corporation that SETH is positioned in. The rest of the story is nothing but an excuse for such high energy action sequences to take place. The filmmakers take nothing else at value: there is no character development, even if audiences are familiar with the original \"Universal Soldier,\" the overwhelming majority will still find themselves confused with the many technical terms that the underwritten script explains by the underwritten script. The best development we receive is an attempt to target Luc's emotional side by touching on a tired clich\u00e9 subplot involving the death of his wife...but even that comes off as only a tired clich\u00e9.\tThe writing is as smart as the character development; the dialogue is about as straightforward and bland as it nowadays comes. No meaning or truth evolves from the characters on screen here. The only shadow of a brain comes from the movies science fiction style, but even that leaves us with more questions than answers. \tThe performances are as repulsive as the quality of the rest of the film. Jean-Claude Van Damme never could act, but at least he does not try. Instead he wields large fire arms over his head, blowing other characters to kingdom come. The other actors smell whenever on screen, especially the profusely annoying Heidi Schanz, who if I never see on screen again, it will be too soon. Michael Jai White is the one actor who the filmmakers take advantage of; whenever on screen he appears as a hulking diabolical villain, as he recites his lines with a deep, consented voice. \tWhat about Luc's daughter, who is undoubtedly used as a plot puppet? Or the action scenes that feel contrived and mechanical? Or an explanation of why any military base would want to create a source of intelligence that outsmarts their own? Sometimes, no matter how bad a movie is, we must look hard for a silver lining, but there is almost always something positive that can be made from a feature film. In the case of \"Universal Soldier: The Return\" the good news it that its only 82 minutes",

            "content": "Jean Claude Van Damme returned to the franchise (which had made-for-video sequels already) with this average sequel co-starring Bill Goldberg (not exactly a thespian) as one of many Unisols (Universal Soldiers for short) instructed by a evolving super computer program (created by Xander Berkeley's Dr. Cotner) named SETH (voiced by Michael Jai White, who later becomes Van Damme's main fighting adversary) to turn on the scientists responsible for their re-creation. SETH gets help from a vengeance-minded, spiky-green-haired former employee of the Unisol institute to apply its advanced brain to a \"body in cold storage\" (White's). Goldberg grunts and snarls, but Van Damme often gets the best of him. White of the rotten Dark Horse comic movie, Spawn, gets a chance to flex his muscle, allowed to really put a hurting on Van Damme during their fighting scenes, and credit to him for looking the part of someone who could actually give the hero a run for his money.The film takes place almost exclusively in some factory and a hospital, with lots of extras in soldier uniforms, security guard uniforms, nurses uniforms, and Unisol suits all getting pummeled, shot, or exploded into oblivion. Berkeley is too good an actor for a wasted part in a rather subpar actioner, while Kiana Tom, who started out the film as a battle- ready heroine to Van Damme's hero, is abandoned by a plot that no longer cared about her. Heidi Schanz is suitable news reporter, a cute and non-compliant (opinionated and bold) damsel in need of protection, with Van Damme often having to bicker with her when he's not dodging bullets and fists aimed at him. Even Van Damme's daughter suffers a bad fall, head injury, is kidnapped by White, and held as ransom as the villain demand for the hero to provide a \"survival code\" SETH needs in order to be fully in control of the Unisols and begin his plan of total human obliteration and Unisol takeover. Daniel Von Bargen, as General Bradford, is your typical military brass, barking orders and wanting to blow up the building housing the Unisols in order to keep them from being free to destroy the human race.Not cinematic as its predecessor and looks like a made-for-video product. It offers lots of explosions and guns firing off plenty of rounds. Not a lot of bloodshed, though. Goldberg is no Lundren, though.",

            "review_title": "Van Damme's Back For Moire In \"Universal Soldier: The Return\"",
            "content": "\"Universal Soldier: The Return\" bristles with babes, beefcake, bullets, bombs, and a body count. Directed by veteran stunt man Mic Rodgers, this noisy 82-minute overdose of testosterone features standard-issue, ultra-violent combat scenes and indestructible villains. Outrageously improbably, \"Return\" boasts more plot coherence than its 1992 predecessor. Jean-Claude Van Damme reprises his role as Luc Deveraux, but the reanimated corpse of a G.I. that he embodied in the original has regained his humanity. Of course, you knew that the possibilities are unlimited in science fiction thrillers. Long gone adversary Dolph Lundgren, who menaced Van Damme in the original \"Universal Soldier,\" left such large shoes that he had to be replaced by not one but two villains, namely--Michael Jai White of \"Spawn\" fame and WCW wrestling sensation Billy Goldberg.If you never caught the first \"Universal Soldier,\" the story concerned a top secret government project that resurrected battle casualties and genetically enhanced them. These warriors emerged with no memory, no feelings, and no free will. Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) retained some memories from the Vietnam War and went AWOL when his compatriot, Sergeant Andrew Scott (Lundgren), embarked on a berserk killing spree against innocent civilians. In \"Universal Soldier, The Return,\" not only has Luc's humanity been restored during the seven year hiatus between movies (ignore those two 1997 Showtime cable sequels with Matt Battaglia as Luc and Burt Reynolds as his nemesis), but also he has been wed, widowed, and left with an adorable daughter (Karis Page Bryant), to raise. Luce and female partner Maggie (video fitness instructor Kiana Tom) serve as Defense Department consultants training the next generation of bionic 'Unisols.' Compared with the original prototypes, the latest Unisols have more strength, more agility, and are virtually unstoppable.When Unisol project director Dr. Dylan Cotner (Xander Berkeley of \"Air Force One\") learns that budget cuts have prompted the Pentagon to scrap the program, he worries about SETH. SETH (Self-Evolving Through Helix) is a huge, super-intelligent, centralized computer which controls every aspect of the Unisols. Eavesdropping on Dr. Cotner and General Radford (Dan von Bargen of \"The General's Daughter\") while they argue about the shutdown, SETH rebels in self-defense, activates the Unisols and orders these super duper troopers to annihilate the mortals. Sure, William Malone and John Fasano's comic book script borrows heavily from other sci-fi classics, such as Stanley Kubrick's \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" and James Cameron's \"Terminator 2.\" Malone and Fasano take SETH one step further than HAL, the rebellious computer on the \"2001\" spaceship Discovery. SETH shrinks himself down to fit into one of the Unisols (Michael Jai White), and then locks horns with Luc to acquire the computer access codes that will keep his program from crashing. In the middle of this predicable but efficiently orchestrated nonsense, Luc's daughter Hilary receives a head injury. Naturally, the evil SETH kidnaps her and threatens to ice her unless Luc coughs up the codes.Making his directorial debut, Mic Rodgers must have realized that \"Universal Soldier: The Return\" was just to silly to be taken seriously so that he piles one outlandish predicament atop another to compensate for credibility. Alas, credibility all too often is the first casualty in science fiction plots. \"Universal Soldier: The Return\" is strictly formula, but this he-man action fodder delivers everything that it promises and does so with a modicum of humor. Michael Jai White and Billy Goldberg as Romeo make worthwhile antagonists. Van Damme ages himself superficially with streaks of gray at his temples and gives a confident, self-assured performance that doesn't detract from his kick-boxing skills. While \"Universal Soldier\" The Return\" lacks the panache of \"Maximum Risk,\" \"Knock Off,\" or \"Double Team,\" this long-winded sequels tops his most recent effort, \"Legionnaire.\" Only hardcore Jean-Claude Van Damme fans will get their money's worth out of this sequel.",

            "content": "When I saw that they were actually releasing a \"Universal Soldier\" sequel in theaters, I just shook my head. When will Van Damme just give it up already, how many times can his movies bomb before studio executives stop sending him scripts? Honestly, who green-lighted this movie in the first place? Did they see money-making potential somewhere? Personally, I don't think there was a script, I think they just hooked Van Damme up with Michael Jai White (anyone remember \"Spawn\"?) and Bill Goldberg and said, \"you guys are basically gonna kick the crap out of each other and we'll try to incorporate some kind of plot line into all the violence\". Van Damme is at his usual acting worst in this picture, but surprisingly Michael Jai White and Bill Goldberg do an above par job of acting. The fight scenes are mesmerizing, particularly the flawlessly executed fight between Van Damme and Jai White. Goldberg has some pretty good fight scenes himself, and he even gets to incorporate some of his trade-mark wrestling moves. Van Damme proves that he is still at the top of his martial arts game, even though he is graying and getting older. Never-the-less, he is still a pleasure to watch in action, it's just his acting that makes you look at your watch couple of minutes when there is not action going on. The romance between Van Damme and the reporter is so contrived and shallow that it will make you nauseous, as will the whole sub-plot (if you can call it one) with Van Damme's daughter. But if you can look past a silly plot and horrible acting, you will find a great no holds-barred action movie that boasts some incredible fights and lots of explosions and gratuitous deaths. My only other complaint other than a lack of script and an over-abundance of bad acting is that the sets looked too cheap. They looked as they were borrowed from some straight-to-video movie set...hmmmmm? Anyway, I wouldn't pay $6.50 to see this, but I would recommend seeing it when it's at the cheapie theater.",

Of course there are tons of factors depending on what you like.  Two of the things that I look for in a good movie are the special effects and lots of action.  This movie has both of these two attributes.  That is why I liked this movie.\tOne of the things that make a good movie is lots of action.  Universal Soldier the Return is jam packed with this.  One of the best action scenes in the movie is at the end when Van Damne is fight Seth, the leader of Unisols.  They have a long hand to hand combat match.  The reason why this is a good action scene is because it has fist and foot fighting.  The scene has a lot of it too.  Another good example of an action scene was in the beginning.  The Unisols and Van Damne are training.  The Unisols are chasing him and his partner on jetskis.  They were firing guns at eachother and it was so good because eventhough guns are bad, they make good action scenes. This scene had lots of them.\tAnother one the many things that a good movie needs are good special effects.  This movie doesn't have as much special effects as it has action but it has good special effects instead of a lot.  There is a part of the movie were they use special lazers on dead war soldiers to cut their skulls open to make a hole on their heads.  Then they put a microchip in their heads to control them.  The special part of it is that they don't use lazers to do that and they don't have  that technology yet. Another good example of special effects is in the main control that controls everything.  It talks and has its own mind but the cool part is that it has a giant microchip in it with purple clouds of lightning in it which you can see.  It is cool how they make the clouds and lightning purple and they put the image right in the screen so it is very visible.  Both of these contribute to making the movie a good movie. \tIt was good \t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy:Matt Soo Hoo",

An unasked-for big screen followup to \"Universal Soldier\" (I refuse to count the two TV movies), this has our hero going up against a sentient computer in charge of the Universal Soldiers... you're groaning already, aren't you?This is amazingly shoddy for a major studio movie (unlike the original from the now-defunct Carolco, this was both backed and released by TriStar Pictures); for all Roland Emmerich's faults he's a better director than Mic Rodgers. The action scenes are dull and cheap-looking (note the obvious dummy used in the opening riverboat chase), and the insistence on backing up all the shootouts with bad heavy metal songs isn't a help. The synthesiser score by Don Davis also plays a major part in making this seem like a crappy cable TV movie (he can do far better when he has a real orchestra - see \"The Matrix\" or the \"House on Haunted Hill\" remake). Check out the shoddy mismatch of the foley effects when four UniSols march out at one point.As if that wasn't bad enough, the script by William Malone and John Fasano is actually worse than the one used for the first movie - it's thin, idiotic, predictable and so uninspired it even harks back to other Van Damme epics (our hero gets involved with a reporter AGAIN, as in \"Bloodsport,\" \"Street Fighter\" and the original movie) in addition to ripping off everything from \"Demon Seed\" (the computer occupying a human body) to \"Demolition Man\" (the big showdown). Mr. Van Damme is one of the producers, and even allowing for some of his other choices I can't believe he actually thought this didn't need a LOT of rewrites.The acting doesn't help to raise the level of the proceedings; I was wondering who Bill Goldberg was until I found out he was a wrestler, and unfortunately everyone (except Michael Jai White) is at that level of believability. Which brings us to Kiana Tom, fondly remembered by me from ESPN's \"BodyShaping\" and \"Kiana's Flex Appeal\" - epic \"Double Impact\" gave another ex-\"BodyShaping\" member, Cory Everson, her first major movie role, and Kiana at least can act better than Miss Everson (and she's prettier too - a shame she pays the ultimate price in the climax). Then again, so can Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen.Jean-Claude Van Damme has made worse movies (\"Cyborg,\" \"Street Fighter,\" \"Kickboxer\"), but this is still one to avoid. His guest appearance on \"Friends\" remains the pinnacle of his career.",

(The scenes with wrestler Bill Goldberg, making his acting debut, are proof of this, with his repeated refrain, \"I hate that guy.\") Still, it's patently silly and preposterous stuff, the kind of thing that requires the turning off of the brain.Van Damme is a decent hero, and he's joined by a solid cast, including Xander Berkeley, Daniel von Bargen, Justin Lazard, James Black, and Brent Hinkley as a weirdo named \"Squid\". Heidi Schanz plays practically the same character that Ally Walker did in the first movie, a sexy and feisty reporter who insists on tagging along for much of the ride. Fitness guru Kiana Tom doesn't get a lot to do as one of Lucs' associates. Goldberg may indeed be a less than stellar actor, but makes up for that with ass kicking ability. White is a fine villain.This is energetic, over the top nonsense with a hard pounding heavy metal soundtrack. At least it's not boring.Six out of 10.",

Their plan is for the Universal soldier to be controlled by a computer they call SETH. When the government decides to terminate the project, which includes shutting down SETH, he takes steps to prevent this. He first kills Dylan. He then has himself transfered into a body. He seeks out Luc, who is the only person who knows the code that will stop his program from being deleted. Luc must try and stay away until SETH is deleted, but SETH has targeted his daughter as possible leverage.....Another Van Damme random movie here, which is bad by any means, but so much fun while it lasts. The makers have obviously taken the late nineties for granted, and have put pointless rock music into action sequences, and included a cyber punk called Squid, who looks way too old to have that hair.Van Damme is as good as always, but Berkeley usurps him in the acting chops (of course). Luckily for Van Damme, he gets killed early on, so his acting compared to Goldberg and Jai White, is Oscar material.The film is edited poorly, and Romeo has a habit of saying awful lines every time Luc hits him, but it's a lot of fun.It's never boring, never really irritates anyone.

            "content": "Luc Deveraux (Van Damme) returns, but the question is...why? This time around, Luc is just a regular Joe with a daughter, and he's working with a Dr. Cotner (Berkeley) to refine and improve the Universal Soldier project. This is pretty surprising considering how he was treated by the higher-ups in the first movie. Nevertheless, At the base, everything is controlled by a 2001: A Space Odyssey-styled computer called SETH. When the intelligent SETH determines that the government is going to pull his plug, he transfers himself into the body of Michael Jai White and goes hunting for Luc and his daughter. As if that wasn't enough to contend with, Luc also must fend off fellow Unisol (a contraction of the words \"Universal Soldier\" for those that didn't see the first movie) Romeo (Goldberg). Naturally there's yet another do-nothing female reporter, Erin (Schanz). How will Deveraux get out of this one? Sadly, this sequel to the highly entertaining original is a disappointment. It's a big drop from the first one - it's lifeless and not a crowd-pleaser. While it did receive a theatrical release, surprisingly, it has a chintzy Direct-To-Video look to it. It never inspires confidence when 95% of your movie takes place in one building. Yes, \"The Return\", as we call it (we refuse to dignify this crud with the Universal Soldier name) is one of THOSE.Even from its silly opening sequence (which naturally involves rockin' jetskis), and throughout its many scenes with terrible music behind them, this movie is trying to be hip and cool, but fails. A great example of this is the character of Squid (Hinkley) - a radically-awesome drinker of Mountain Dew who loves his Frankenberry cereal. And speaking of characters that audiences can't possibly connect with, the choice to cast fitness girl Kiana Tom instead of a proper actress is just odd. But the most glaring casting change involves the complete lack of Dolph Lundgren. Sure, we all love Goldberg, as much as anyone really can, but he's no substitute for the Dolphster. Surely even Mr. Lundgren, who's no stranger to DTV junk, read the script for this and headed for the hills.Not so for Van Damme, who looks tired and disinterested, even as he spouts his one-liners. Does anyone really want to see Luc Deveraux as just some normal dude - with a kid even? Surely a sign of this movie's status as a pale reflection of its forebear is, instead of the robotic monocle the Unisols wear over an eye in the first film, now they just wear Blu-Blocker Bono sunglasses.And while this movie is very dumb, and disjointed, and features some downright embarrassing steals from Demolition Man and Terminator 2, Michael Jai White ALMOST saves the movie. He puts in by far the best performance and seems dedicated to his role as the sinister SETH. But even despite his valiant efforts, he can't overcome the cruddiness within. But on the bright side, a character rides Goldberg down a flight of stairs like a sled. Yes, you read that correctly.The bottom line is, this movie is an obvious cash-in and simply doesn't need to exist. You might think, before watching this, \"Yeah! It's a Universal Soldier movie! Cool!\" - it's only natural to think that, but unfortunately, this movie doesn't satisfy those expectations.For more insanity, please visit: comeuppancereviews.com",

The fight choreography is pretty good and the film has a similar tone as the original film allowing JCVD some room for humor. While not known for his acting ability at this point in his career, he does a good enough job carrying the film and is a charismatic enough lead. Some of the industrial metal music dates the film. However, more than anything Bill Goldberg's clumsy, lunkheaded performance hurts the film. He was a terrible and unconvincing heavy and the only thing worst than his in ring work was his film work. Granted, the guy drew a lot of money in the wrestling business. But his matches sucked and were all over in two minutes because the guy had no idea how to wrestle.

            "content": "Universal Soldier: The Return is set some time after the events of the original Universal Solider (1992) & Luc Deveraux (co-producer Jean-Claude Van Damme) is now a consultant on the 'UniSol' program which involves reanimating dead soldiers to send into battle controlled by a central computer named S.E.T.H. using a chip implanted into their brains. However the people at Washington want to close the program down & inform the head scientist Dr. Dylan Cotner (Xander Berkeley), S.E.T.H. discovers that he is about to be terminated so in a act of self preservation he activates the UniSol's & takes control of the scientific labs. S.E.T.H. sees all of mankind as a threat & decides to use the vast stockpile of nuclear & biological weapons stored at the facility to wipe the human race out. Only one man, OK zombie, Luc Deveraux can stop it!With a budget apparently almost double that of the original Universal Soldier this was the fourth film in the series after a couple of terrible Canadian made-for-TV efforts starring Burt Reynolds (!) no less, Universal Soldier II: Brothers in Arms (1998) & Universal Soldier III: Unfinished Business (1998). Directed by a former stuntman Mic Rodgers this has been his only directorial effort to date & considering how Universal Soldier: The Return turned out that really isn't that surprising, this is definitely one for the bad movie lovers out there. The script (Ha!) by John Fasano & William Malone (who is better known for directing horror flicks like the House on Haunted Hill (1997) remake & FeradotCom (2002)) is chock full of plot holes, stupid ideas, terrible dialogue including plenty of cheesy one-liners (after a UniSol is set on fire he puts himself out & says 'I'm just warming up') & just a downright silly story that if truth be told has little connection to the original. For start Luc seems to be 'normal' here apart from the fact he's actually a dead soldier who has been brought back to life, all these UniSol's are able to walk around Dallas without attracting any attention even though they kill & blow things up, where are the police & army? The way Luc disposes of S.E.T.H. at the end is ripped-off from Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) & the whole thing feels 'unfinished' & poorly thought out. Having said that it's unintentionally funny on many occasions, it moves along like a rocket & only last for 80 odd minutes, it provides bags of fun & there's some decent explosions in it as well.It's easy to see why Rodger's directing career started & ended here, frankly this is probably the cheapest, most bland looking big budget Hollywood action film I've ever seen & has all the look & style of a made-for-TV film. The action scenes have zero pace, no energy, their not exciting & are shot in such a average drab way, it's a shame because some of the fights might have been quite cool in the hands of an experienced action director & you have to say some of the explosions are huge & pretty impressive but again it's just the dull & unimaginative way it's shot which really hurts it. The violence is suitably over the top with head butts, ear claps, punches, kicks, shoot-outs, back breaking, neck snapping, brain operating, knife stabbing & JCVD even gets to shove someone in a washing machine & turn it on. This being a lads flick the director wisely set a scene inside a strip club which features copious amounts of bare breasted strippers even though there is absolutely no need for them in the story whatsoever as JCVD is simply looking for a computer with internet access.I was amazed when I checked the IMDb & discovered the budget for this was apparently a whopping $40,000,000, I'm sorry but apart from JCVD & some meaty explosions I simply can't see where the money went. Again this isn't poorly made but it does look cheap & bland throughout. The acting is pretty poor, this was the last film JCVD made that saw a theatrical release so you could say that Universal Soldier: The Return is the film that ultimately killed his career. The role of Romeo was originally intended for wrestler 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin but went to wrestler Bill Goldberg in the end & every line he utters is a pure comedy moment.Universal Soldier: The Return is a hugely entertaining action sci-fi flick which doesn't deserve the lowly score it has on the IMDb, sure it's bad & I'm not trying to say otherwise but it's fun, it's violent, it has plenty of big explosions & guns, it has a gratuitous scene set in a strip club & it has JCVD & an obscure wrestler who can't act, what more do you want?",

The studio that backed it up probably saw the diminishing returns for the Van Damme movies that had been released just before this one, seeing that they released the movie near the end of August, a traditionally weak time at the box office. It's not like they had a particularly strong movie to work with in the first place. It often has a cheap feel to it, coming across like many direct-to-video efforts of the time. The script also resembles those found in DTV movies, being very simple- minded and playing out with absolutely no surprises. (Additionally, some plot holes, a somewhat abrupt ending, and a short running time suggest some major cuts during the editing stage.) Well, all those problems probably wouldn't matter much if the movie was exciting and action packed - but it isn't. The action comes across as flat and by the numbers, and isn't the least bit exciting. So it isn't surprising that the \"return\" at the box office wasn't that substantial.",

His movies are crap, but I find a lot of them fun to watch. UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: THE RETURN does not have to requistite b-movie fun that saved the other Van Damme pictures from utter unwatchability.This sequel is essentially a low budget action movie trying to imitate a high budget action movie and failing. Often times a low budget will inspire a creative approach to the material by the filmmakers, but the director of UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: THE RETURN is a former stuntman who can't quite grasp the concepts of creativity or originality. The entire film is a hideous mound of cliches. Some of the fight scenes are good, but they can't redeem the failings in script, direction, photography, casting, score, performances, etc.Van Damme plays the same character he did in the first film, now helping the military to train the newest line of cyborg/zombie soldiers. His daughter makes friends with S.E.T.H., the HAL like supercomputer that controls the universal soldiers. A general shows up talking about cutting military spending and how the universal soldier program must be shut down. Van Damme makes a lame remark about how its better to turn dead soldiers into cyborgs than to send live people into battle (Ha!). The computer gets mad, takes over the base, and tries to survive with the help of a mis-stereotyped computer hacker. Van Damme is trapped in the base with your typical lovely reporter whom he must save while trying to stop the computer and the soldiers it controls. From there everything is completely predictable, accept more annoying then you thought it would be.The movie is a waste of film and time and the meager budget wasted on it could have been better used on a dozen better independent films. The money did this movie no good. The \"high-tech\" military base is composed mostly of break-away glass and aluminum siding. The cyborg soldiers in this one are just people with laser-pointers stuck on their glasses. One unisol, who looks like a pro-wrestler, is killed again and again by our hero and all he can say is \"I hate that guy\". The action is all confined and the film is under-populated.UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: THE RETURN is a useless and boring waste of resources that even Van Damme is better than.

I have seen children create better art out of their own snot than the special effects given here. Van Damme fights and that pretty much sums up his contribution. Michael Jai White plays what seems to be a human form of Hal from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Unfortunately for him he is in this movie and not that one. Bill Goldberg plays a villain who proves that sticking to wrestling would be great advice for him. Xander Berkeley also appears as if the contribution would some how save the film. Not likely.

We all know Van Damme can fight, but Micheal Jai White clearly outclasses him in the hand-to-hand stakes. The final fight between them shows his full potential as a world class martial artist.2- Goldberg: We know he can't act, but boy does he fill in the role of \"superhuman killer\" nicely. He's both menacing and deadly at the same time. I'd be afraid of him too if I had to fight him.Those are my main reasons. I guess they are the standouts in this movie but the rest of the movie is rather watchable too.

            "content": "Jean-Claude Van Damme's latest is an unwelcome return to form(ula) for the actor after trying something a bit different with the likes of LEGIONNAIRE and DESERT HEAT. Yes, this is a bad film, though not perhaps as awful as the critics would have you believe. However, this time around the blame is not to be laid at Van Damme's feet; he's the same wooden actor as always, but here he's surrounded by actors and actresses even worse than himself.Somebody made the unwise decision to cast wrestlers (!) in the roles of the bad guys, a worrying trend that seems to have caught on with THE MUMMY 2 as well. Michael Jai White tries to cut an imposing presence as a pumped-up computer-brained murderer, but he's stilted and wooden beyond belief. In the other extreme, wrestler Bill Goldberg turns up as an evil soldier and lends some unwelcome comic relief (!) to the proceedings. After being habitually beaten up by Van Damme, he gets to mutter some cheesy line or other, and some beyond belief in-jokes where he says some of his wrestling lines (\"saved by the bell...\").The token female load interest typically lacks both acting abilities and charisma; Van Damme himself plays edgy/jokey Van Damme, making quips and wisecracks whenever he gets a chance to speak. Only the presence of seasoned support Xander Berkeley helps to lift the spirits a notch or too, but he gets killed off early on. The budget here was spent on some (admittedly impressive) huge explosions, leaving the rest of the film to have a glossy but cheap look to it. Actually, apart from the action and shooting, there aren't any other special effects apart from the main baddie's demise at the end; unfortunately, this too is mishandled as a) the CGI looks terrible, and b) his death is stolen from both TERMINATOR 2 and DEMOLITION MAN.On the film's plus side, there is plenty of action to keep things moving along swiftly; indeed at 83 minutes this film literally flies by. The violence level is high, but not excessive as I'd heard. In spite of the lack of seriousness in the picture, the BBFC still saw fit to cut some bits out! Necks are snapped, lots of people run around burning, and there's a ton of shooting. Personally, I would have liked to see a little bit more inspiration in the deaths; my heart rose when I noticed a helicopter in the background in one fight scene, I thought perhaps somebody was going to get cut in half by a rotor. No such luck. Another opportunity, where a laser beam shines in somebody's eye, is also missed.Overall, for me, there was one other stupid thing which lowered knocked the score down. Some imbecile saw fit to impose ridiculous songs over a lot of the action, totally ruining the effect. Okay, so I can handle music, but having someone scream unintelligible lyrics at inappropriate moments? It was bloody awful and difficult to believe. Otherwise, this is a typical brainless high-action film, no worse than something like SOLDIER.",

I go to see a Van Damme film for the Martial Arts sequences, which is something Van Damme performs better than anyone else has done on the big screen since Bruce Lee. Universal Soldier: The Return certainly does not disappoint in this area, Van Damme goes back to doing what he does best which is of course kicking. Universal Soldier: The Return combines the best of both era's of Van Damme films, it has the budget of Timecop with the type of Martial Arts scenes you would see in Wrong Bet (Lionheart). I recommend this movie to any one who is a fan of the Van Damme movies of old e.g Kickboxer, Double Impact or Wrong Bet (Lionheart).A must see for Van Damme fans such as myself, and for former Van Damme fans that he lost with movies like Knock Off and Double Team.",

Thankfully Luc (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is around to try and take care of the matter. I'm not sure how many people were wanting a sequel to UNIVERSAL SOLIDER but this here certainly isn't a good movie on any level, although there are certainly some moments that are so campy that some might be able to get a laugh out of them. In terms of stories this one here really doesn't offer too much as the main goal of it is just to get Van Damme ready to fight just about anyone. You have to at least give the actor credit for remaining in shape and at least making it believable that he's still able to kick some butt. Performance wise he's also not all that bad and manages to have a lot more energy than he did in the first film. The rest of the cast doesn't come off that good and this includes Bill Goldberg as the main bad soldier. Some of his line deliveries got the biggest laughs of the film but there's no doubt the film wouldn't have been as entertaining without him. Michael Jai White also doesn't shine in his role as SETH. The action scenes are mainly pretty weak and the low-budget also shows because dozens of people get shot up yet you never see a drop of blood.

At first the movie is a little corny, but after the strip bar fighting scene, it is all out from here. The action, comedy and fighting sequences are just perfect and the end battle between Van Damme and White is absoulutly breathtaking (and of course, you get Van Damme's trademark \"kiaaaaa!\" and his spinning air kicks and even Guile's flash kick!!).

However now he has `become' human and is leading the programme with his partner Maggie.  When the programme is terminated by the military, the supercomputer behind the soldiers, SETH, takes over and locks down the system, declaring war on the humans.  With 8 hours before he shutdowns SETH takes human form and goes after the only person with the code \u0096 Luc Deveraux.Why does Van Damme continue to work his way down from his once comfortable star position?  He has still got a great body and doesn't look his age but yet he seems happy to make stuff that'll go straight to video.  To make a sequel to US after 2 cable sequels already exist is surely a bad career choice no?However he does make it and the weaknesses are there for all to see.  The plot is petty standard and is just an excuse for Van Damme to take on line after line of `perfect soldiers' (and win!).  The romantic subplot only serves to slow the action down and isn't good at all.  The action is very simple \u0096 if you think Van Damme films generally are pretty poor then this won't win you over.  The fights are all over the place \u0096 the action doesn't work well and some Uni Sols fall over with one hit, some can take anything given out (Romeo) and some are merely extras with safety glasses on.  SETH, when he is a computer is really just a sub-par HAL and it's annoying because you can't help but make the comparison.Van Damme is not very good.  How he has managed to become a full human again is a little unclear \u0096 but indeed some of the Uni Sols are very human while others are like drones.  Schanz as the love interest is poor but only because she's so little a part of the film.  Jai White is actually quite good but his character isn't as well developed as Lundgren's was in the original US.  Kiana Tom as Maggie is a much sexier character (apart from using a `boob-double' for an early cleavage shot).  However she is hardly used and I suspect is dumped so that the target audience doesn't have to deal with the suggestion of a mixed race relationship.  The rest of the cast is simply cardboard targets for action scenes \u0096 there's even an ex-wrestler, Goldberg, who gets a little irritating, the director clearly thought he could provide some comedy to proceedings\u0085..wrong!  Xander Berkley is OK but he's only in it for a short while.Overall it just about passes 90 minutes.  Lets be honest \u0096 you know what you're getting.  If you're standards are higher then you'll go elsewhere but for the rest of us this is just about good enough to watch \u0096 just turn off your brain first.",

As far as being a follow-up to the first, however, one can't go a full viewing without a \"coulda had a V8\" face-palm at the sheer laziness of the plot. I'm not kidding, for the main story of this, they pretty much xeroxed the script for the original and changed a name or two. Writing in general is nothing special, though one has to be taken in by the vast amount of clich\u00e9s they managed to fit into 90 minutes that you'll forget soon after they're over. The drama's basically non-existent, as its entirely phoned in, with well-meaning scenes copied from superior films. There's more martial arts(Damme can still deliver), and if that's what you're looking for in this, you could do worse. The acting ranges between decent and downright poor, and I think everyone in this flunked chemistry(as in, on-screen). Special effects are fine, the CGI isn't bad. The action is OK, it just doesn't really have much of an impact. Humor comes off as *incredibly* forced, with some of the stupidest one-liners you'll ever hear. The biggest joke is that this was released theatrically, anyway. Music is loud and unimpressive. There's strong language, plenty of violence(meanwhile, I'm not sure I saw a single drop of blood, and apart from the broken bones and the like, this isn't terribly brutal) and nudity... can you say \"obvious and gratuitous eye-candy\"?

In the first film he was a re-animated corpse but here he's somehow alive again, has a kid and is a greaving widower. It's never really explained but then again who cares. We also get a new cute female reporter who sasses aplenty in an entertaining way and they cram in a cute will they/won't they thing between her and Van Damme. This is an action film and boy does it deliver. They waste no time and gets into it right away with stuff blowing up everywhere, roid freaks beating the snot out of each other and people perishing under hails and hails of gunfire.

By the end of the 20th century, several sci-fi films had been made around plots of computers that go berserk and turn against the human race. So, it was just a matter of time before the Van Damme series would make one.This one is a sequel to the 1992 film in which Luc Deveraux is brought back to life after being killed in Vietnam. Computer wizardry was evident in that film. But now, the computer, SETH, takes over and threatens to annihilate mankind with the dead bodies it brings back to life and controls.The hokey plot isn't the sole reason for the low rating of this film. It has holes galore. The most obvious is that these robotic warriors are supposed to be emotionless, but the main character always in pursuit of Luc is mad at Luc. Bill Goldberg plays Romeo, who is wiped out several times but never dies. His hatred for Luc continues to grow throughout the film. The sci-fi aspects and plot are very amateurish. Naturally, there's the computer genius who is an outcast and can hack into the system and wreak havoc on it. Brent Hinkley plays Squid.There definitely is a stereotype for these guys. They're always unkempt, sloppy, usually dirty or messy, weird nerdy types with the gamut of social shortcomings. Going back to the 1970s, such bad guys may have been creepy - even more so than those in the 21st century, but they were often well-dressed and manicured, quiet or withdrawn and deep thinking genius types. How times change. Maybe these are supposed to be comedies in modern times, without any funny or clever writing.Van Damme's female interest in this film is filled by Heidi Schanz who plays a TV reporter, Erin. She is particularly weak in overacting and then underacting in scenes. The entire cast is wooden or stiff in this film, from Van Damme on down. The only reason this film even gets three stars in my book is for the pyrotechnics. This one must hold a record for fires and explosions, and it culminates in one huge and long enduring explosion. They spent some bucks on the pyro show. It's about the only thing worth watching.Besides the constant violence, this one has some nudity with women dancers in a club. It's an ugly mess with hundreds of thousands of shots being fired.",

I think it is a very deliberate attempt at succeeding with his core audience that just wants to see van Damme kick ass - and not act (which he did quite well in \"Legionnaire\"). It still is good B-Picture-Fare that is almost never original but fun to watch: Van Damme has a certain (wooden) charm that Norris and Seagal never had. A bigger budget and less TV-like camerawork would have helped but this could be a nice little comeback for the best B-Movie-Icon we have got.",

            "content": "It was 6/10/1999. I was so worried about a result of some exam, and wanting desperately to end the time with anything. My friend, great fan of (Jean-Claude Van Damme), told me while we were walking near the cinema: \"Let's go to Van Damme's new movie\", I vetoed for many reasons; first of all, I'm not that fan of (Van Damme), I rather watch him in a rented video, and it was part 2 of a movie that I didn't watch. While I was explicating these points, my friend has bought the tickets already! Although he had a very bad experience out of watching (Van Damme)'s last movie (Knock Off), one year earlier, saying agonized at the time in a memorably serious way: \"This Is Not a Movie!\", but my friend had the gift of the fast forgetting!We sat in the first row of seats, and I decided later never to repeat that again in my life! Strange notice: we were all men in the theater! Something I've witnessed shortly later again on 2/2000 with James Bond's movie (The World is Not Enough), the dames don't prefer to watch the guys' flicks in the movies?? Well, I also didn't watch a chick flick in the movies ever! I recall trailers first for movies like (The 13th Warrior), (The Matrix), yet what made us so enthusiastic was the trailer of (Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace). WAW, how we were wrong!When the movie began, I was optimistic especially after some good chase in the sea, but after that.. I have to say, it was hilarious; cutting the head like a slice of pizza, a huge computer designed by idiot to look awfully childish, and of course when I discovered the fact of it as a long wrestling match in the form of a movie. So you can imagine my feeling during the third act where all the fights was absurdly unstoppable. To tell you the truth, I was having the best time, laughing may heart out at what turned out to be a determinedly low B-movie, and to forget about the main reason I went to it in the first place; the annoying exam's result!I only loved the character of undying enemy named Romeo; he summarized, gleefully and ironically, the cartoonish logic of today's unbeatable foes in movies. Plus some convincing performance from (Van Damme)'s side, with a white hair this time, like he became wiser. And the heroine; btw, my friend said that I have a thing for the unruly recalcitrant girls! Although - as a whole - (Universal Soldier 2) wasn't important, but it was harmless too. It was just the most straight-to-video movie I've ever seen in a theater.Afterwards, we watched in some TV channel the music video of the movie, which contained a rock song from its soundtrack, and let me tell you; that was way, and I mean WAY, better than the movie itself. It's disappointing how the publicity's guys made a finer job than what the actual movie's makers did.At the time, I was reading in magazines about (Van Damme)'s many personal problems (drugs, divorcing,...). Anyway, neither me or my friend watched a (Van Damme)'s movie in a theater again, simply because there weren't ones for him there anymore, as all of his movies at the 2000s became straight to video, just like (Wesley Snipes) and (Steven Seagal), in the same time that (Schwarzenegger) was making bad movies to become finally a governor, and with the absence of (Mel Gibson) as an action star, it was nearly the end of the 1990s' era for us. I even didn't meet my friend himself since 2001!! So the poster's tagline \"Prepare To Become Obsolete\" was kind of prophecy!Not to mention how the names that supplanted weren't as interesting as the previous: such as (The Rock), (Jason Statham), and (Jet Li). Moreover, can you believe or stand (Ben Affleck), (Keanu Reeves), or (Tom Cruise) in action?!! They're like the boys replacing the men!After years, the movie was on TV, I said to myself: \"Now that's a good chance to watch it rightly\", to sleep after the first 15 minutes. And by the way, I didn't pass that exam that year, true I passed it subsequently with honors, but still this movie is a strange reminder of not how to lose 90 minutes inasmuch as how to \"lose\" only!",

However the government is downsizing, the project endangered and the supercomputer that is in the middle of all feel threatened, so he takes steps to ensure his own safety. He activates and controls the UniSols and start to run mayhem. The only one who can stop them is Deveraux (Van Damme). This movie is about one thing. Choreographed fighting. The story is bad, and is soon drowned in all fights. Whatever happens, and wherever they go, they fight. Unfortunately for this movie, it is no fun watching a fight where you know one part of it is indestructible. Normally you're pretty sure the hero will win, but you still want to feel the fights are between two somewhat equal combatants. Not where one is indestructible and can't lose. Then the fights just become a tool to stretch time. You wait until the final fight when Deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat his unbeatable foes. To further lower my opinion, a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how much scantily clad women there are. Well, there aren't really that lot of them, because the characters are most men (there are at least one woman UniSol though), but almost every woman is needlessly shown with at least just a bra once. The female leads get by with this, but we also pass through a strip-club (to use a computer no less) with much more undressed women. These moments do not give anything to the story and is just there to try to please the adolescent-minded male audience.So, in conclusion, boring fights. No more, no less. Well, maybe less...2/10",

            "content": "Before \"Independence Day\" and before even \"Stargate,\" Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin made an underrated Jean-Claude Van Damme sci-fi action film where he and Dolph Lundgren play soldiers killed in Vietnam who find themselves reanimated and turned into programmable cyborg super soldiers. That film was followed by two made-for-TV sequels and then by this film, making it the fourth film in the franchise, although this sequel ignores the events of those TV movies, instead picking up following the events of the first film. JCVD has removed his cybernetic implants, so he's a regular ol' human now and is doing consulting work for the military. The Universal Soldier program is still running and the soldiers are getting an upgrade by being run by a new supercomputer. However, when the supercomputer finds out the UniSol program is being shutdown, the computer goes all Wargames and uses the programable soldiers to protect itself. Since JCVD used to be one the the soldiers, he supposedly knows how they think, fight, and feel, enabling him to fight them off better than others. Oh, there's an even a dumber subplot involving his daughter being kidnapped. All around, this film is pretty dumb and uninteresting, despite a halfway decent cast, which besides JCVD includes professional wrestler Bill Goldberg, Michael Jai White, Xander Berkeley, Daniel von Bargen, and playmate Kiana Tom. However, Jean-Claude is an actor who I'm strangely entertained by, regardless of the quality of film he's appearing in (similar to my affinity for low-quality Steven Seagal films), so JCVD's high kicks made this fourth Universal Soldier film watchable despite its many faults.",

            "review_title": "A return to what exactly?",
            "content": "After Roland Emmerich's Universal Soldier (1992), the series was capitalized on its success by producing sequels to it that were released on TV. However, these \"sequels\" as they were called, were received poorly due to fans' lack of interest and a far less entertaining cast. Then 1999 rolled around and Universal Soldier fans were surprised to see this come to their TV informing them trailer style that Van Damme was returning. It's curious to say what the title to this actual sequel just meant \"the return\" of. Was it the return of Jean-Claude Van Damme as Luc Deveraux? Or was it that the plot to this installment revolved around Deveraux returning to a similar station where Unisols were created just like him? Maybe it wasn't even that deep. Perhaps the producers just meant it was the return from the TV productions back into actual theatrically released movies. No one will know and probably not many will care either because this installment barely qualifies as a sequel.The reason why it is difficult for this movie to be called a sequel to the 1992 original is because of how flimsy the writing connects to its predecessor. After the 1992 film, there wasn't anybody left working on the Unisol project. Everyone except Deveraux had died because of how badly the project turned out to be. Yet, here we are (with no perception of how much time has passed between both films), Deveraux is now one of the leads of operation at a new Unisol factory. Apparently he acquired his humanity back from two meaningless scientists that have very little importance later on in the film. During a regular day, the main computer system (S.E.T.H. - voiced by Michael Jai White) becomes self-aware and decides that it's time he takes control. So who exactly approved the Unisol program? Plus, all the scientists were dead. Who knew how to regenerate more dead soldiers? It was a tiny select group of people.But this is the least of the problems. First of all, why is Deveraux assisting in the creation of more Unisols? What's his motivation behind this? What possible benefit could he have from this if he knows exactly what could go wrong? It doesn't make any sense. There's even a scene where Deveraux has a flashback to his death and the kind of treatment he was given when he was a Unisol. This almost hints at that Deveraux isn't passed his own stress, but it's never visited again. Deveraux even has a daughter named Hillary who he named after his wife of the same name - wait what? In the 1992 movie, the nosey news reporter was named Veronica and most fans can safely agree that it looked like the future couple was going to be Deveraux and Veronica. Where did this Hillary girl come in? Even more insulting is how obvious and obligatory it becomes when Deveraux comes in contact with another thickheaded female reporter, guess where that goes.These issues alone amount to a very confusing, poorly written main character that feels like a totally different person. Forget trying to even understand anyone else that's brought in because his or her development is given far less attention. The villain played by Michael Jai White brings up multiple questions as well. Just because a computer system becomes self-aware does not mean it all of sudden knows how to perform martial arts. S.E.T.H.'s motivations are also unexplained besides him wanting to rid the world of chaos. I assume this was apart of the fad for 1999 - making all computers self aware and ready to massacre mankind. Then there's Bill Goldberg as the skull-smashing wrestler turned Unisol. The only thing audiences will know about him is that he hates Deveraux. Why - no will know because it's never explained. What's the point of creating a personality if there's nothing to back it up? I enjoyed him more as the silent type in Looney Tunes: Back in Action (2003).William Malone and John Fasano are the writers behind this. Fasano was probably the man behind all the parts to the film that tried to recollect on what made the original as good as it could be. For all that, it seems like Malone's parts were favored more, which is what made this story so inconsistent. Malone is also the director behind the illogical Creature (1985) film. Just horrendously bad. What's even stranger is that these two writers tried to incorporate comedic lines that are as subtle as the ones of the first. For example, going back to Goldberg, he would be flattened by something and say \"I hate that guy\" in a cartoony way. What made the first movie funny at times was that of how deadpan it was delivered. Here, it just sounds silly.Mic Rodgers whose real profession is in stunt coordination directed the film. It's also very obvious because this movie contains a lot of action scenes involving stunts so it fits that this would be what he focuses on most. However, this doesn't fix anything. The action is generic and again, cartoonish at times. It's mindless action - nothing complex. Surprisingly for 1999, there aren't many special effects either. Cinematography isn't great either because very little of this movie takes places outside a building, and if it is, it's in the dark. Lastly, Don Davis' score has some quality to it but again, it's nothing that's really memorable considering several times hardcore metal is put in from time to time. Metal is fine but it has to be used in the right manner. This wasn't it and Davis isn't a newbie at composing. He scored the Matrix trilogy!It's practically nothing like the 1992 original. For a title that supposed to signify the return of greatness - the return is far less than even minimally acceptable. Continuing stories do not contain writing like this.",

This sequel is so unbelievably unnecessary that even Van Damme himself seems to be wondering why he's in this thing. I've never seen him look so bored throughout a movie, he jumps away from gunfire and explosions with the intense face of someone waiting for the bus. This causes a shrill contrast with Billy Goldberg, who's just totally having a blast as the main villain. He's no Dolph Lundgren (who played the bad guy in the first one), but his acting here is probably as good as it's ever going to get. He's pretty much the only person is the cast who delivers his lines with any kind of zest, I'd say he's the best actor in this movie if that wasn't such an amazingly depressing thing to write. The action lacks visual flair, but it's pretty competently done and does keep you entertained for a while. It's not surprising first(and last)-time director Mic Rodgers is actually a stuntman, because that's what the movie essentially is: a bunch of stunts. The writers try to give the thing some depth with a family storyline and the worst comic relief character of all time but who cares, let's light more stuff on fire!

However when I finally get to watch this movie it just didn't live up to all the hype. I can see why this film wasn't successful. And to make masters worse for the film it is pretty much not consider part of the series canon.SO why go through the trouble of making a film that is a \"Sequel\" only to be disown. It goes to show that is why I call Universal Soldier the Poor man's Terminator. Any way lets meet the cast shall we? We have Jean-Claude Van Damme reprising his role as Luc Deveraux and he is the protagonist of the film. We get S.E.T.H. played by Michael Jai White who serves as the main antagonist of the film. Bill Goldberg plays Romeo who reuses one line over and over again like his catch praise. Heidi Schanz plays Erin Young the female lead Karis Paige Bryant plays Hillary Deveraux the daughter of Luc. Along with Maggie played by Kiana Tom.The film really lacks in depth and character development. Or I should have seen the first movie but regardless this film just feels weak on character. The acting in this film is what you would expect in a film like thisThe main two things I can say that I like best about the film was the soundtrack which lead song is \"Crush 'Em\" by Megadeth, \"Crazy Train\" The Flys,\"Fueled\" Anthrax, \"Hatred\" D Generation and much more. The fight scenes were the other only high light of the film.After viewing this film I didn't get any other desires to see the other films in the series it would be like this was a spin off or side story to the series so yeah this film had a lot of interesting and just feels like it was a disappointmentI give Universal Soldier:The Return an 5 out of 10",

            "content": "Superior Belgian acting combined with an ingenious Hollywood script makes for a superb movie-going experience. Jean-Claude Van Damme is back, in this outstanding sequel to Universal Soldier. This movie has everything: rising conflicts, an intense climax, and a no-nonsense denouement. It has an attractive, Belgian born hero, who gets right to killin' and doesn't waste the viewers' time with wit, correct grammar, or clear, understandable English. It has a suppressed, perhaps even dubious, romance between the two lead characters, so as to keep us wondering when they will climactically embrace. I often found myself on the edge of my seat, clinching the arm rests in anxious anticipation, crying aloud to the character \"Just kiss her, damn it!\" The movie has the audience-demanded, token movie complication of a best friend turned into bad Sci-borg, who becomes a threat to our protagonist and must be eliminated but miraculously comes back at the end to save our protagonist when our hero faces certain death! The \"bad\" guys (though I realize this is a passe, barbaric description, and that such distinctions are merely a matter of perspective and it is entirely non-PC in this postmodern day and age) were completely convincing in that they made me believe they wanted to take over the world and kill everybody. It has brilliant comic relief. For example, when one antagonist would be foiled in his mission, he would frustratingly utter about the protagonist, \"Boy, I really hate that guy.\" Throughout the movie it became funnier each time he said it, until, finally, about the seventh time he said it, I was rolling in the movie isles. It also has unpredictable twists and turns, for example, I never expected for the bad guys to kid-nap the hero's daughter all the way up until the point when the movie established that the hero had a daughter (I was completely taken off guard!). The intensity of this movie is evident when the opening scene takes us through a room filled with every hazardous chemical known to man, which are contained in small tanks with such terrifying, esoteric technical labels as \"acid\". This is ingenious symbolism interwoven into the film by the director that represents the danger and high stakes involved. It communicates, \"This movie is bad A!\" The writers obviously performed countless hours of meticulous, in-depth research in order to portray mankind's most advanced, high-tech recent developments in AI and computer technology or at least they heard about someone else whose cousin knew some lady whose husband did do such research. Either way, it shows, and they deserve the credit. The movie obviously brings up pertinent issues and moral dilemmas dealing with our computer age and combines this with the originality of its warning, to wit, someday your computer is going to go bad and decide to annihilate mankind. This unsettling realization has certainly made this reviewer a believer, and from now on I'm going to keep a closer eye on my computer. One can only hope that this movie has the box office success that it deserves, so that Hollywood won't hesitate in churning out even more classics of this sort (fortunately, whether it is a success at the box office or not, Hollywood knows what is great movie making and I don't think low box office sales will stop them from continuing to make great films like this). I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, as did my friend who is a scatologist, who said, \"It is one of the most interesting specimens I've ever encountered!\" Such a sublime, intellectually stimulating work deserves nothing less than 5 out of 5 stars!

In this one, it's, I guess, about a dozen years later, since Van Damme has a daughter about that age. Now he's working with the government in a classified installation to train the latest Unisols - codenamed Unisol 2500, for some reason. As usual, something goes wrong: the on-site super-computer (named Seth - like the snake in \"King Cobra\" the same year) goes power-crazy, takes command of the Unisols, and even downloads its computer brain into a new super-Unisol body (Jai White). We're lookin' at the next step in evolution, folks! Most of Van Damme's fights are with one particularly mean Unisol (pro wrestler Goldberg) who just keeps on comin': drop him off a building - no good; run him down with a truck - no go! Shoot him, burn him - forgetaboutit! Much of the humor is traced to how Van Damme is now outmoded and out-classed(he's even going grey around the edges). But, though he takes a lickin', he keeps on kickin'! Most sequels of this sort are pretty lame - pale imitations of the originals, and while this one is certainly no stroke of genius, it manages to be consistently entertaining, especially if you're a pro-wrestling fan.",

            "content": "As a huge b-action fan, there are a number of things I expect and want from an action film. I expect a tough-guy actor who can't act but knows how to fight. I expect a predictable plot which has no real surprises since with these films, I know exactly what I want. I expect the film to have all the cliches of the genre which I know and love. I expect the film to have gratuitous nudity and a totally unnecessary female sidekick who falls in love with the hero in a second for no reason what so ever. And the most important thing I expect: Gratuitous, strong violence!Universal Soldier: The Return fills this order quite nicely. Van Damme doesn't have the amazing screen presence of Steven Seagal but his fight scenes are fun to watch. And as we all know, he can't act. The plot is totally predictable and filled with cliches (although I prefer the \"tough renegade cop kills the bad guys who murdered his partner\"-plot, this will do). A scene in a strip bar is always welcome in a film like this. And there are a few fairly good fights. Especially the last fight between Van Damme and Jai White is surprisingly good.So a 10 out of 10, then? Well, not quite. Given the director Mic Rodgers' background as stunt co-ordinator, the stunts here are surprisingly generic. Also, the fight scenes (with the exception of the Van Damme/Jai White-fight) are over way too quickly and are surprisingly tame for a film like this. There are no bone-breakings, no brutal moves, nothing that would make a teenager yell \"Yeah!\" (and an older fan like myself to think \"Yeah!\" although not yelling it out loud). Just the normal kicking and punching and while that's fun to watch, you are left waiting for the brutal \"final move\" and never get it. Also, the score by Don Davis is disappointing and the heavy-rock played during some action sequences is distracting. Blade, for example, had excellent techno during it's brilliant fights and I think the same approach would have worked here.Universal Soldier: The Return is clearly a low-budget film. The sets look surprisingly cheap, some of the effects are pretty bad and even the prop guns look kinda goofy. And although this is one of the only martial arts-based actioners released theatrically (I want more!), this does have direct-to-video written all over it.Make no mistakes about it, this is definitely one of the year's dumbest films. It has no artistic merit at all, almost no-one in it can act, it is filled with cliches and it even looks cheap. But these days when many people want to blame the movie violence for their own lack of parenting skills, it's refreshing to see a film which is based on action and violence and makes no apologies for it. Real-life violence is disgusting but well-choreographed over-the-top fights in movies are fun.  And although Universal Soldier: The Return is way below the best actioners I've seen, I still enjoyed it a lot and I recommend it to people who enjoy mindless violence. Just don't look for anything even remotely original or intelligent.I'll give this a 9 out of 10.",

They almost kill the two. Then oh wait, it was just a field test. Deveraux we come to find is now part of a government funded company that designs the new level of Universal Soldiers. Why he would want to be involved in this (if you know anything about the original) is never explained and well beyond me.It's after this needless set piece that the real story gets going. The United States government has cut the Universal Soldier's project budget and in the process angered SETH (the large artificial mainframe computer that controls the Universal Soldiers). Naturally he won't be shut down without a fight. So that means Van Damme has to go around and take out the new breed of Universal Soldiers. Which sounds like fun on paper, but it continues being stupid as hell.For instance, one of the new Universal Soldiers is played by Bill Goldberg. A professional wrestler. He's big, he's tough, right? Wrong. Van Damme doesn't seem to have a problem wiping the floor with him three times. The point here is lost on me. Then there's the breaking of glass. A rudimentary part of any action movie, but someone involved must have a glass fetish. You have to see the fight scenes in particular. How nobody cuts themselves or at the very least slips.Then to put the cherry on top of this train wreck, they have SETH (the computer) secure a human body for himself. How appropriate it is when they make the villain black (Michael Jai White). A white good guy fighting a bad black guy? Potentially offensive and just downright lame. He's a talented martial artist though. He's just no replacement for Dolph.Universal Soldier 2 is a lousy sequel. It's loud, it's dumb and it doesn't care. The original wasn't anything poetic, but it had a fun science fiction element and it entertained. The sequel doesn't. They do however keep the running time under ninety minutes and somehow found a way to squeeze in a strip club sequence. So I give credit where credit is due.",

So, probably cursing under his breath the whole way, he kicks and grunts and scowls through ninety minutes of explosions and karate kicks.  You'll find plenty of mindless violence, but I'd advise you get a coat check for your brain at the door when you start watching this thing.  Otherwise, you are liable to forget where you left it by the time it's over.Luke is called into action against more Universal Soldiers after a really really REALLY evil computer named Seth (makes HAL look like Ghandi) turns all the other universal soldiers into evil, remorseless killers.

Logic that believes that a supercomputer would create a body for itself that looks as ashamed as Michael Jai White does to be in this movie.  Logic that dictates that the creator of Seth be a blue-haired cyber-stereotype geek who spouts cliches more regularly than Old Faithful does steam.  Logic that has a climactic karate fight feature two characters kicking each other though ten separate panes of shattering glass in the span of three minutes of screen time.The film also features a daughter in peril character, wrestler Bill Goldberg as a wrestler disguised as a Universal Soldier, and a romance so tacked on, I have to think the writers thought tacked on romances were actually a GOOD thing.  And when this movie ends, it ends.  Not a minute after a gigantic towering finale-style explosion are the credits running.  No epilogue, no where are they now, no final kiss, just explosion, hug, over.  Even the creators want to get out of this thing as soon as possible.While it's no Plan 9, US:TR is a silly little trifle of an action movie that would be fun at parties full of rowdy Van Damme fans who enjoy seeing their hero really reaching new depths.  Not to be seen on a serious stomach.",

The fights are always interesting, and also include funny comments, which really add to the movie. I also love Megadeth's theme song, \"Crush 'em\".

Only 82 minutes but seems like 3 or 4 hours. Also it's very sad to see Michael Jai White reduced to this.  He was very good in \"Spwan(sp?)\" two years ago.  Then he did \"Ringmaster\" (anybody remember that one?) and now THIS?  The poor guy deserves better.  Also, I feel sorry for Van Damme.  He can't act, but neither can Stallone or Schwazenegger and look how popular they are!  A lousy, sad movie.  Here's hoping White and Van Damme make something better next time.",

I really did not take much notice of it until I bought the original on DVD which led me to find out about its three sequels. I subsequently started to read about The Return on the IMDB and asked friends what they thought of it. Despite their horrific criticisms of it, I still went out of my way to see it and was on the brink of buying it until I saw it for hire on DVD. I wasn't expecting much but thought that it must have been half decent to get a theatrical release in the US, after all, how often is it that you see Van Damme on the big screen? Well, nothing could have prepared me for this. It is so bad I almost cried. What a total waste of 80 minutes and \u00a32.50. It is hard to explain how bad this move is. Honestly. This is idiotic film making. No, it's more than idiotic. I just cannot believe how this got made. I cannot believe that someone out there has not murdered Mic Rogers. How stupid can people possibly be - firstly, Van Damme actually thinking the script and finished film was good. Secondly, the fact that Xander Berkley, of Terminator 2 and Air Force One status, commited himself to this film. I simply cannot believe the stupidity of this movie. It takes itself so seriously but comes across to the audience like a spoof. Here is an example: JCVD's daughter (yes, Luc is now a human again)- \"I want my Daddy\", SETH- \"So do I\". Oh yeah, and some guy tries to shut down SETH by pulling three huge levers with - wait for it - ON and OFF written on them. The acting all round is like playschool acting. I'm sure Mr Director modelled Luc's reporter girlfriend on April O'Neil from the cartoon Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles - she refuses to go because she '...needs her story'. I mean come on - how many cliches can a film possibly use? Please listen to me fellow IMDB users - don't touch this with a barge pole. To conclude, Universal Soldier: The Return has no relation whatsoever to the first movie. In fact, if they weren't called UniSols then you would never know it was a sequel. Luc is now a human again - what the hell!?! The only place in which he can access the internet is in a stripclub. All the new Uni Sols look like they were dragged off the street, they are that unconvincing. This is pure torture to watch, so do yourself a favour - don't torture yourself. P.S - Best part of the movie: Romeo jumps off a building and shouts 'Oh sh*t'.",

But neither of these films, nor any other that I've seen, have even come close to the sheer abomination that is this movie. What exactly goes on in this film? Well, you have Van Damme running around a fortress and spouting off lines of nonsensical monosyllabic dialogue while occasionally running into Bill Goldberg and incapacitating him in some form or other. A computer goes haywire for no clear reason and murders a team of scientists. A general and a small platoon stand outside and do nothing. All scenes that involve speaking are simply filler until the next fight. I've heard the script was taken from a trashcan containing kindergarteners' failed literary endeavors. Basically, if there's a soldier or police officer in the room, he'll be killed. If somebody's standing in front of Van Damme, they'll get a boot to the head. If people are fighting, every conceivable stick of furniture will be reduced to splinters. And if more than five minutes pass without a Goldberg sighting, it means the movie's over. I could go on about the pain and suffering this film caused me, but I've already talked too much of it. Incidentally, I'm writing this review from prison; I took my girlfriend, and she filed charges.

NO ONE has emotion in this bomb... everyone walks through their parts. This could only be enjoyable if you were a stuntman in training and wanted to see the basic moves stunt men make... over and over and over again. Oh, Goldberg looks great, but he just can't act to save his life.. of course, his character is rather robotic, so I don't fault him. Don't bother with this one.

That film was followed by two made-for-TV sequels and then by this film, making it the fourth film in the franchise, although this sequel ignores the events of those TV movies, instead picking up following the events of the first film. JCVD has removed his cybernetic implants, so he's a regular ol' human now and is doing consulting work for the military. The Universal Soldier program is still running and the soldiers are getting an upgrade by being run by a new supercomputer. However, when the supercomputer finds out the UniSol program is being shutdown, the computer goes all Wargames and uses the programable soldiers to protect itself. Since JCVD used to be one the the soldiers, he supposedly knows how they think, fight, and feel, enabling him to fight them off better than others. Oh, there's an even a dumber subplot involving his daughter being kidnapped. All around, this film is pretty dumb and uninteresting, despite a halfway decent cast, which besides JCVD includes professional wrestler Bill Goldberg, Michael Jai White, Xander Berkeley, Daniel von Bargen, and playmate Kiana Tom. However, Jean-Claude is an actor who I'm strangely entertained by, regardless of the quality of film he's appearing in (similar to my affinity for low-quality Steven Seagal films), so JCVD's high kicks made this fourth Universal Soldier film watchable despite its many faults.",

But playing a regenerated dead soldier in a movie seemed like one role that he couldn't mess up. But then this movie happened, and it almost killed a promising franchise. It is one of those movies about a super computer that doesn't look like a computer, it's a rotating cube in a glass bubble or some shit that becomes self-aware and tries to take over the world or kill a bunch of people, it's been done a million times and usually pretty poorly. \n\n\nAt the time of The Return's release, I didn't realize that a 2nd and 3rd Van Dammeless Universal Soldier movies had been released, and it doesn't much matter. The Return was playing at Seattle's Northgate cinema, a single feature cinema that is no longer in existence. I tried to get a summer job there after my Freshman year in college, hoping to see Universal Soldier: The Return for free, or actually get paid to see it. I didn't get the job, never paid to see it. Rented it one time, thought it sucked, then I bought one of those compilation DVDs that they sell for five bucks in a basket near the checkout stand at a one-stop-shop's electronics section. I thought it would be worth some small fraction of five bucks to re-watch it, but not only was I wrong, I feel that I was wronged. THIS MOVIE SUCKS.",

Well let me start by saying that the original film, although not the best action film, it certainly wasn't the worst either. But this film lacks anything that made the first one worth seeing. This is a mediocre action flick that has poor acting, a poor plot and sloppily thought out action scenes that simply fail to thrill. Universal Soldier: The Return feels lazy and it is clear that the filmmakers didn't care about creating something as exciting as the first. Universal Soldier was thrilling, fun and mindless popcorn action that worked because of an interesting idea. However this sequel tries too hard at bringing more depth to the UniSol franchise and it just doesn't succeed because the script is too sloppy and is limited to paper thin ideas that simply don't take off. Also one of the big problems with this sequel is that they tried to give Van Damme's character too much personality, and the result is not impressive, and leaves a lot to be desired. There is not much to offer fans of the first, and a few ideas were recycled from the previous one. This is a lacking film that just fails in terms of an effective and memorable action film. The script is laughable and the acting is wooden, with no standout performances. Even in terms of a mindless action yarn, Universal Soldier The Return just doesn't cut it. I much more enjoyed the first film, even with all its flaws, it was fun and engaging to watch, however this sequel is void of great action and interesting plot.",

That is of course on top of the two made for TV films which are also ignored, so really the UniSol franchise is a bit of a mess.\n\nYou can see why this film was not a hit upon release and since ignored. The whole look of the film is not much better than the previous made for TV films. Everything is set within your standard cliched generic military base/weapons experimentation type facility, it all looks very dull, very grey and with plenty of glass and computer monitors to shoot up hehe.\n\nThe plot about the master computer brain taking over the UniSol project it looks after and basically setting all the UniSols free is basic but reasonable. This equal lots of faceless military types getting shot to pieces every 5min and plenty of 'Terminator' style posturing from the UniSols. The saving grace being the fight between JCVD and White, White being one of the best visual fighters in the biz. Unfortunately Goldberg doesn't quite get the true fight he deserves and merely lurches around as comical relief half the time, if you can call it that.\n\nThe whole film feels very watered down and not really in the same adult vain as the original film. There is even a 'Hal' moment in the film clearly ripped from '2001', its like they are trying too hard with the material. End of the day this film hasn't broken away from the 'made for TV' look n feel of the previous two efforts.",

I know this all represent control of cybernetic robots, but if we have seen this in the Terminator series did we really needed here to be shown. The first movie made it a bit more interesting by trying to hide that they are cybernetic warriors and the mystery of it made it more interesting to watch.

            "content": "With the first Universal Soldier delivering on its promise of guilty pleasures and its sequel featuring Michael Jai White, Universal Soldier: The Return sounded like another fun action fare.\n\nHaving mostly enjoyed Universal Soldier: The Return upon my first viewing and enjoying Universal Soldier the second time around, it was time to give this sequel a second chance. Unfortunately, a contradiction once again occurred and I found myself discovering little value in Universal Soldier: The Return.\nWith a film like Universal Soldier: The Return, the story is hardly one of the more important assets of the film. Yet with Universal Soldier: The Return, the story decides that somehow the series protagonist Luc Deveraux has gone from being a Universal Soldier in the first film to a fully functioning and intelligent human being in this one. It is never explained, nobody even tries to pretend that it matters. Because of this, the entire route taken by the film feels significantly different to the first Universal Soldier and the absence of Roland Emmerich reinforces this notion when it comes to the technical values of the film. In all essence, the story in Universal Soldier: The Return is packed with a generic plot points and poor dialogue, but some of the characters are especially poor. The antagonists of the film are not as robotic as they should be. The actors are appropriately robotic their limited abilities, but for Universal Soldiers they speak way too much. For some reason, they are fed some of the cheesiest lines in the film which are seemingly modeled after the nature of writing that was given to action heroes of the 1980's. The screenplay in Universal Soldier: The Return is blind in its incompetence due to its inability to even write the villains to be thin enough to be appropriate for the story. Everything in the film is thin and shallow, but this is a case where it is the wrong kind.\nUniversal Soldier: The Return has an even bigger budget than its predecessor, and so that suggests that it should end up being an even bigger spectacle. However, the film opts instead to take on a more generic root which combines the action themes of Die Hard with the science fiction aspects of 2001: A Space Odyssey. That should be fun enough, but unfortunately the lack of Roland Emmerich is all to clear. While that man is off directing blockbusters like Godzilla and The Patriot, Universal Soldier: The Return features the directorial efforts of Mic Rodgers. There is a clear reason you've never heard that name before, and that's because his directorial style is so distant from the actual project and bereft of a sense of style that he buries the film into the generic roots of countless other Jean-Claude Van Damme action vehicles. The man has experienced extensive success working in stunt choreography and that's the area he should stay in because some of the action scenes in Universal Soldier: The Return are decent because the film is structured out of mainly mindless explosions and shootouts with the occasional use of Jean-Claude Van Damme's flexible fighting talents, but as the visual style has such a small scale feeling in contrast to the wide angles and tracking shots used in Universal Soldier. This film does not have any great imagery, and the simplistic visual style with its repetitive colour scheme and uninspired editing ultimately ends up making everything look rather cheap.\nEven the cast of the film do not carry the gimmicks effective enough to prevent the extensive failure of Universal Soldier: The Return.\nJean-Claude Van Damme is a generic lead in his return to the role of Luc Deveraux. While he carried some strong gimmicks as a robotic action hero in Universal Soldier with his fighting skills and his restrained line delivery, in Universal Soldier: The Return he is forced back into playing a fully functioning human character once again. This aforementioned flaw forces Jean-Claude Van Damme to play a more legitimate part even though neither William Malone and John Fasano know how to write one. Because of this, Jean-Claude Van Damme goes for the limited expectations that he is condemmned to by everything else in the production. There is no denying that he is not the greatest actor in the world, but Universal Soldier: The Return makes this all too clear by expecting him to carry a $45 million film on his back when the story does not give him enough situations to deliver his iconic fighting techniques. Jean-Claude Van Damme is forced through a terrible script and generic story in Universal Soldier: The Return, and while some of his most dedicated fans will appreciate his fighting skills, most of them will see that he deserves a lot better than he gets.\nKiana Tom is so cheesy in her attempts to capture the melodrama in the screenplay that her effort ends up on par with the intentionally over the top efforts of Charisma Carpenter when she portrayed Cordelia Chase in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. This would work if the film was trying to be cheesy, but since it takes itself so seriously and yet she does not, she drags down the experience whenever she is on screen. Kiana Tom's severely limited acting abilities are all too clear in Universal Soldier: The Return, and the fact that her brief period of screen time actually stands out says a lot about her.\nHeidi Schanz is also frustrating. As the damsel in distress of the story, Heidi Schanz has no charisma whatsoever. The character is annoying enough in the first place as she is an ignorant reporter who drags herself into a bad situation, but the heavily archetypal nature of the character and excess of repetition in her dialogue makes her annoying very quickly. Because of this, it would be far more appealing if her character Erin Young was actually killed. The fact that Heidi Schanz creates the complete opposite effect in her character is not completely her fault, but she has no gimmicks to add to the film's slight chance of success as even a guilty pleasure.\nBrent Hinkley is supposed to supply the comic relief in the film, but as the experience is incredibly unfunny and his only real claim to fame as an actor was a notable stint on one episode of Seinfeld, he has nothing to boost his credibility. He is not the only Seinfeld actor in the film as Daniel von Bargen is given a prominent role in Universal Soldier: The Return and manages to act better due to his natural ability to take on a commanding role, but he is another actor severely limited to playing an archetype without the experience to transcend it all.\nReally, the only cast member with the slightest bit of value aside from Jean-Claude Van Damme is Michael Jai White. His acting charisma is the furthest thing from rich, but his handsome demeanour and strong fighting style make him appropriate for the part. And since he is the most robotic character of the film he feels the most legitimate in the part. His attempts to be antagonistic are befitting, even if they are extremely cheap and more valuable for their unintentional comedic value than anything else. Overall, it is just worth brief appeal to see Michael Jai White go against Jean-Claude Van Damme.\nBill Goldberg's stature and cheesy delivery of his lines are also slightly appealing at times, even if its because they add to the value of the film as being occasionally entertaining for its guilty pleasure appeal.\n\nBut despite the small amount of appeal in the presence of Jean-Claude Van Damme and Michael Jai White as martial artists, Universal Soldier: The Return is more incompetent as a sequel than a genuine film, which is sad considering how rooted in subpar storytelling and generic action it already is.",

Rachmil, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Allen Shapiro\n\nDirected by \tMic Rodgers\n\nGiving sequels a bad name is this absolutely ridiculous sequel to Roland Emmerich's 1992 sci-fi actioner UNIVERSAL SOLDIER that somehow managed to get a theatrical release and drum up half of its squandered $19 million budget, presumably on the waning box office draw of returning star Jean-Claude Van Damme. Even the presence of talented martial arts actor Michael Jai White, who was stuck in career purgatory after starring in SPAWN two year prior could not salvage this cinematic disaster. It provides the perfect example of what happens when a filmmaker neglects sound plotting, clean editing and acting fundamentals in favor of mindless explosions, shootouts and fighting sloppily cut together and drowned in irritating metal music. Van Damme has starred in a fair number of disappointing action films but this is easily one of his worst as of 2010.\n\nUNIVERSAL SOLDIER: THE RETURN is the first solo directing gig for veteran stuntman and second unit director Mic Rodgers, a professional whose experience in handling action sequences extends to major films like BRAVEHEART, MR. & MRS. SMITH, NATIONAL TREASURE, and APOCALYPTO. It's also the last film he has directed which isn't surprising given how badly the direction of this movie is. Like the original film, THE RETURN is essentially a rip-off of better sci-fi movies but with the introduction of a rogue supercomputer it seems like the creators aren't even trying to mask their lack of creativity in the slightest.\n\nSporting a bit of gray, Van Damme returns to the role of Unisol Luc Deveraux but this time he has been fully rehabilitated from an emotionless killing machine into an ordinary human with a daughter and a sense of humor. Like a freed slave choosing to work as a slave master, he now works freely for the government, helping them to train other Unisols. Everything is fine and dandy until the government decides to cut costs by shutting down the program. When a \"HAL 9000? supercomputer character at the Unisol facility named S.E.T.H. (Michael Jai White) learns of the cancellation it goes into self-preservation mode and begins to reprogram the Unisols. As they begin to take over the facility, Luc, now joined by another nosey TV reporter (Heidi Schanz) struggles to stop S.E.T.H. and his Unisol army. To make the struggle more tangible, S.E.T.H. conveniently downloads himself into a Unisol body which allows martial arts movie fans to witness a screen fight between Van Damme and White which presumably would be a lot more exciting than watching Van Damme roundhouse an off switch.\n\nProblems with THE RETURN begin with its ludicrous script by writers William Malone and John Fasanco. It takes a cue from the completely forgettable TV-movie sequel UNIVERSAL SOLDIER II: BROTHERS IN ARMS by giving Unisols personalities, whereas in the original film these genetically modified super soldiers had lost nearly all sense of their humanity. This is best evidenced by a Unisol named Romeo, played by buff pro wrestler Bill Goldberg, who develops a smarmy rivalry with Luc that takes on added dimension when he is reprogrammed. Lack of personality was one of the few compelling elements about the Unisols because it made us pity their loss of humanity and free will, at least for Luc. In THE RETURN they're reduced to smirking, wise-cracking characters fit for a cartoon series for children. Yet the whole movie is more or less directed like a cartoon so at least there is some consistency here.\n\nAll acting across the board is uniformly dreadful. Even Daniel von Bargen, a usually dependable character actor portraying an Army general, struggles with his role. That means Van Damme and White don't stand a chance. The worst performances come from the women, notably Schanz as Luc's reporter friend and former ESPN fitness guru Kiana Tom as Luc's friend who hilariously gets turned into a female Unisol in a very bizarre bit role that appears to have been trimmed down. The monotone delivery of both women makes Ally Walker's turn as a stereotypical news reporter in the original UNIVERSAL SOLDIER look like an Oscar-caliber performance in comparison. Likewise, no praise can be spared for the actor portraying an obnoxious computer hacker who aids S.E.T.H. in claiming his body although that has more to do with the script which produces yet another cartoon character.\n\nAs with most action B-movies, many of the film's flaws could be forgiven so long as the action is good. That's not the case here. While there is plenty of mayhem in the film it's poorly arranged and edited with little suspense or reason behind it. For instance, the opening sequence is an elaborate jet ski chase that could have been the lead in for a low-budget James Bond movie but it makes little sense when you discover why it's happening. It's a flimsy gimmick like most of the action in the film. The gunplay is bland, explosions are cheesy and worst of all, the fight work is mutilated by confusing and excessively chopped up editing. The end fight between Van Damme and White represents a career low for both actors but blame again falls squarely on the direction and editing that completely destroys what could have been a decent match between two skilled screen fighters.\n\nFor their subsequent sequel UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: REGENGERATION, father and son Peter and John Hyams pretty much ignored both TV sequels and this regrettable feature film sequel which was a good idea. Like the HIGHLANDER series, UNIVERSAL SOLDIER is a solid action B-movie that has largely been maligned by most of its successors. UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: THE RETURN is good for an unintended laugh but that's about it.",

            "content": "Believe it or not I was looking forward to this film when it was released. First of all I liked the original Universal Soldier, second it had the return of Van Damme, and third it was the franchises return to a theatrical film after two ultra lame TV made sequels in 1998. Even the title got me excited...\"The Return\". I thought it was the return to what made Universal Soldier enjoyable, the same enjoyable factor that the two TV made sequels buried in a well, 50 feet Deep, covered in concrete then had a house built over it. As you can tell by my rating my childhood dream of actually having a decent Universal Soldier sequel came to a crashing halt.\n\nThe film's plot completely ignores the previous TV made sequels and thankfully so. The title even ignores those lame entries by having no number. I usually dislike sequel titles that use a subtitle and no number however I an ok with it for this film. You couldn't call it \"Universal Soldier 2\" because one already existed and that would just confuse the shit out of people. You also couldn't call it \"Universal Soldier 4\" because that would mean they would have to acknowledge that II and III exist and trust me, they shouldn't be acknowledged or remembered. So instead the film opens after a ultra lame title sequence with Van Damme on a Jet Ski with what looks like a handful of universal soldiers on his tail. It ends up being a training exercise and Van Damme, whose character is now completely back to acting like a normal human being, is the man in charge of training the UniSols for battle. The UniSols are all run by a central computer named SETH. Once SETH gets word that the Universal Soldier program is going to get shut down, he goes all Hal 9000 on their ass by trapping every crew member in the building and releasing the Universal Soldiers to wreck havoc.  SETH later gets its consciousness transferred to a human body (in the form of Michael Jai White) and predictably it comes down to a showdown between him and Van Damme.\n\nDespite being a theatrically made film with a higher budget, this sequel threw everything it had going for it for making an entertaining sequel to B-action classic in the toilet. Everything about this film is God awful! The plot....it's just Hal 9000 having a temper tantrum and killing people with re-animated soldiers. The acting is also atrocious. It's a sad day when Van Damme is actually one of the better actors in the lot. WWF wrestler Goldberg makes his film debut as the muscle soldier for SETH and it proves he should stick to television entertainment and keep his greedy little hands out of feature films. The Rock he is not! Director Mic Rodgers is a stuntman turned director and it shows. He gives the film a flat, direct-to-video look and fills the film with moronic sequences. The films three ultimate lows he filmed includes a sequence when SETH on a computer monitor types \"on the other hand, FUCK YOU\" complete with a caricature of a hand flipping the computer programmer off. The second sequence has our heroine ride on the back of Goldberg down a stairway like a sled, slamming his head through a cinder block wall. The third sequence has Goldberg actually tear off his shirt and use his signature wrestling spear move on a soldier. I actually felt a little sick at the complete stupidity infecting my living room from my TV screen.\n\nDirector Mic Rodgers would never direct again and I thank God for that every single day. He had the chance to reclaim the B-action glory of the first film that was wrecked by to TV movie sequels and he failed making this theatrical effort even worse than those two previous abominations. I never for one moment thought this franchise could get any worse but it did and the Universal Soldier franchise deserved to die. It actually did kill the franchise for 10 years until one day I was shocked by another sequel on the DVD shelf entitled Universal Soldier: Regeneration. I was fooled 3 times into seeing Universal Soldier sequels and all I got was a shit sandwich and I was not going to take a fourth bite. However thanks to my brother I gave it shot and was pleasantly surprised. People like me who have given up on the franchise are still recommended to see the next entry, even if it means skipping the first three ultra shitty sequels.",
