            "content": "For me personally I've always been a bit off and on with Michael Mann what few films I've seen from him I'm not a big fan (even Heat) but I was still desperate to see The Insider and now haven seen this masterpiece I will always give him credit as The Insider is now one of my all time favourite movies with amazing performances. The characters in this movie are incredibly investing because Mann doesn't paint them as perfect they're all making mistakes and screwing up which makes them seem more human. Russell Crowe is absolutely amazing in this movie with Gladiator also being one of my favourite movies I wasn't sure if I'd ever see a better performance from him but here he is just as good not only is his accent convincing but the toll taken on him is perfectly conveyed through his masterful performance. Al Pacino is every bit his equal he perfectly conveys his no nonsense, experienced character making you believe that no one else could have played this part. The tension in this movie is done just right every time Crowe puts his (or his families) safety on the line you feel it you are worried as to what the company is going to do to him next. Is also a very interesting film, to see all the ways in which Crowe and Pacino are trying to combat Big Tobacco using the law in very specific way and it further enthuses Pacino's experience and Crowes vulnerability. When things do go Crowes way you feel it the writing in this movie is so good that you are desperate for Crowe to succeed because overall you see that he just wants to do the right thing. I absolutely adore The Insider it's suspenseful and heartbreaking and in many ways also uplifting it's got some Career best performances and makes me desperate to see more films from Michael Mann.100%-A+",

            "content": "The Insider is the only film I remember having seen where I walked out of the theatre with a headache because of the intensity of the story. Michael Mann is one of few directors who has such an in-depth understanding of both the subject of his film and the nature of that subject, that he is able to portray a realism that is nearly impossible to match.There is real skill displayed in the way in which the Insider weaves through the aspects of both Bergmann and Wigand's lives. Whereas a lesser director would have thrown the characters at each other in an artificial collision, Mann introduces each character as being average professionals each living in their own respective stable lives. It is only when their chance encounter creates a subtext that could consume them both does the real chemical reaction in the story take place.Bringing life to these fantastically written characters are two of the most talented 'big-name' character actors of our time, Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. Surprisingly, it is Crowe that drives this film forward, and his portrayal of Wigand is spot-on perfect. His is an honest humanity, both a loving father and a flawed husband who never fully balances his life under the pressure of circumstance. Crowe nails the performance by not hamming-up the character, but rather by understating his personality. This works in that it is the character that is elevated while the actor disappears.That is not to ignore the excellent work by the remainder of the cast. Pacino's performance is accented and accentuated beautifully by Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Mike Wallace. Most notably are several standout scenes mixing Pacino, Plummer, Philip Baker Hall and Stephen Tobolowsky that ground the underlying tensions of the film fantastically. And the juxtaposition between the cold, hard New York settings and the organic nature of Mississippi further press this film beyond standard non-fiction works.Easily one of the best dramas of 1999, the Insider is a standout member of that elite club of great historical dramas such as All the President's Men that are few and far between. It is for that audience that appreciates skilled performances meeting skilled direction and restrained, mature writing.",

            "content": "Not always, but usually a Michael Mann-directed film means good things for movie buffs, and this is no exception. Tremendous acting highlights this movie about a behind-the-scenes look at a \"60 Minutes\" story of a man who blows the whistle on a tobacco company. Al Pacino, as the TV show producer \"Lowell Bergman,\" Russell Crowe as the whistle-blower and tobacco scientist \"Dr. Jeffrey Wiegand,\" and Christopher Plummer as \"Mike Wallace\" all are riveting in their performances. They are intense characters, as are many of the supporting characters in this involving film.There is little action in here but a ton of tension in the first hour of this long (158 min.) film. The story held my interest even when the tension left, thanks to the acting, the great cinematography, involving music score....well, just about everything. It's simply a well-done movie, similar to Mann's \"Heat,\" except without the violence.The only negative was the obvious Liberal bias, but that's not surprising being it's about \"60 Minutes.\" I wasn't surprised when Ken Starr got a cheap shot, for example. This film bias could have been a lot more blatant so I'm not complaining. Obviously, they went a overboard in their stand against the tobacco industry, repeating the same damaging scenes over and over. However, I appreciated they didn't shrink from pointing out how the network was covering its own behind even though it was hurting its most successful program.Photographer Dante Spinelli did an incredible job making this look fantastic despite the fact that there was no great scenery or exotic sets. As mentioned, this is just great film-making. What else can you say?",

            "content": "THE INSIDER / (1999) **** (out of\"The Insider\" prospers in almost every way, shape, and form possible. The production is a masterpiece of visual style, moving performances, and penetrating dialogue. The story is captivating, even at 157 minutes. There is more than enough unexpected plot twists to keep our attention throughout-and at a consistent pace. Many movies will have moments of inspiration and intrigue, but not \"The Insider.\" This movie is one long intriguing moment, a moment that is never boring or lacking. It is also believable and entirely convincing. There is a realistic look into the behavior of journalists and their desire for information. It is so intelligent about revealing the most important information little at a time, always at the perfect second.Russell Crowe's character is the heart of the film, one of the most active protagonists seen in a movie all year. He plays Jeffrey Wigand, an ex-employee at Brown & Williamson, one of the nations largest cigarette manufacturers. Its chairman (Michael Gambon) has fired Wigand for questioning some of their potentially harmful research tactics and business routines-but not before blackmailing him into signing a strict confidentiality agreement that threatens his much needed severance package currently providing for his wife and their two young girls. When the company even further jeopardizes his existence, he blows his fuse and prepares to release information on the indecisive industry of B&W.He gets his opportunity when Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), an ambitious and experienced reporter from the CBS news program \"60 Minutes,\" receives a package regarding product safety studies at another tobacco company. Bergman contacts Wigand, aspiring towards hiring him as a transitory consultant for a potential \"60 Minutes\" show. Bergman senses some vital information withheld in the knowledge of Wigand, therefore further investigates what he is making the executives at B&W so concerned.The film makes many unexpected turns; in the second half, it smartly switches focus from Wigand to Bergman. After losing his privacy, secrets, reputation, and family, Wigand revealing startling facts and starts a new career teaching chemistry. But Bergman faces further complications. His TV Network refuses to air the segment because they could be sued big time for helping break Wigand's confidentiality agreement.\"You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own f*****g confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets,\" explains Bergman.The dialogue is one of the brightest, most thought-provoking material in the film. All of the little quirks in typical conversation are captured, the stuttering, the spontaneous explicit declaratives, and the sharp remarks that add a scathing zest to the character's personalities (Agent: Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand? Wigand: Yes. Yes, I do. I get extremely emotional when *******s put bullets in my mailbox!).The movie's dramatic premise is so clear, so precise, so uncommonly absorbing. It expresses the true stress and nature of the traumatic emotions of the characters. There is also an excellent introduction of both Wigand and Bergman, giving them depth and human dimension. Despite a few members of my cinema discussion group disagree, I extensively enjoyed the piercing middle-eastern soundtrack consisting of awkward beats and fitting tones.Al Pacino is cautious not to steal scenes from co-star Russell Crowe, but when his time comes he lets out a stark and involving performance. Crowe is worthy of his Oscar nomination for best actor; he delivers a performance of great subbtlness, but with an intense underlying tone of innovative depth and power. He captures all of the little tensions and stresses of his character, making his scenes involving, subversive, and taut.Michael Mann is the film's director, who also directed the 1995 thriller \"Heat\" starring Val Kilmer, Robert De Niro, and Al Pacino. Here, he pays close attention to details; when a character pushes numbers on a pay phone, the camera captures the feeling-also hitting golf ball against a backdrop, dropping glasses on a table, and notably in an intense scene where two people fax each other important statements and questions. Mann also injects effective camera angles complete with slow motion photography, taking the view of the character, and close up shots.\"The Insider\" inhabits a strong social message dealing with the influence of television, reputation, honesty, and so forth. The biggest ethic I think Mann is trying to get across is of modern morality: always do the right thing, follow you conscience, no matter what the cost. Then there's the film's most provoking issue: \"Fame has a fifteen-minute half-life. Infamy lasts a little longer.\"",

The film recounts a chain of events that pitted a guy against the giant tobacco industry. And this film would really be in depth and drag the characters thru a fight of their lives.Al Pacino(still one of the best actors in the business)is in top form with a strong performance as veteran \"60 Minutes\" producer Lowell Bergman and Russell Crowe(is the man affected by it all the insider himself former tobacco executive Dr. Jeffrey Wigand). The story is pretty cut and dry when Wigand is fired by the tobacco company, he agrees to become a paid consultant for a story that Bergman and \"60 Minutes\" is working on about the unethical ways within the tobacco industry. This all leads to a long battle between all with a lot of legal cat and mouse games which puts everyone's reputations on the line.As expected the tobacco industry will use any legal and corporate means they can to help save a billion dollar a year habit. Still both Bergman and Wigand are fighters that are searching for answers and they want justice in the form of truth as with every little bit more evidence is uncovered.Cleraly this is a harrowing drama with legal and emotional twist and turns it has an in depth cold hard edge that keeps you glued while searching for answers and fighting for the truth with twist. \"The Insider\" was for sure one of Michael Mann's better made films.",

Truth always trumps fiction.This movie was very well directed and well filmed, but above all it was well acted. Both Crowe and Pacino deliver memorable, believable performances, creating characters for which we can feel for, with whom we can identify. I agree on most of the Oscar Nominations, but I also feel that maybe an Oscar was warranted for best screenplay which is probably the best part of this motion picture.Thumbs up!",

            "content": "When Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) made the statement above in a sworn deposition, it changed the tenor of the story for me. Everyone knows that smoking cigarettes is bad for you, but when the damage caused by smoking is exacerbated by chemically treated additives designed to affect the brain and central nervous system so that users become addicted, well that adds a whole new dynamic to this story of corporate complicity to prevent the truth from reaching the American public. I wasn't following this news event all that closely when it broke, but one didn't have to because most of the glaring headlines told the story. I do remember the bit about the 'nicotine delivery business' and it had the effect of sending chills up your spine when associated with the 'ammonia chemistry' Wigand also spoke about. For me, this film played out almost like an espionage thriller. You had the upper levels of corporate and media hierarchy entangled in a sophisticated legal dance designed to keep the truth from coming out. One has to credit the real Dr. Wigand for the courage and fortitude required to withstand the daily onslaught against his character and integrity. Russell Crowe turns in a skillfully conflicted performance of a family man on the brink of having his entire world collapse while trying to do the right thing. Al Pacino may be better known for other roles but he was never finer than he was here as firebrand CBS producer Lowell Bergman, carrying his loyalty and integrity right to the very edge with his company and on-air personality Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer). The only part of the script I didn't agree with was when Crowe's character is described by Bergman as being an ordinary person under extraordinary pressure for telling the truth. No matter how you slice it, Wigand was no ordinary person to put up with a divorce, the breakup of his family, and personal character assassination in order to out the tobacco companies. It takes a certain kind of individual in the face of overwhelming opposition to become, in a paraphrase of an earlier comment, a truth delivery system.",

Russell Crowe's best work on par with LA Confidential (if not better) and a gripping shot by Christopher Plummer as 60 Minutes anchor Mike Wallace.For those who can handle it, read on:Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) has been fired from his job. He has to break the news to his wife (Diane Venora, who I believe should go on to be one of the best actresses of all time) that their beautiful home, swank cars and health care plan (their oldest daughter is athsmatic) are about to go down the tubes. He's been given a severance package but that's about to fall apart as well.Enter Lowell Bergman (Pacino), producer for CBS Television News' bastion of journalistic integrity, 60 Minutes. Bergman's doing a report on fires that were started by careless smokers and has been given a report so huge and full of technical jargon he can't make heads or tales of it. Through a friend he is put in touch with Wigand in the hopes of finding a translator. Wigand thinks Lowell is coming after him because of what he knows about his former employers, a major tobacco company.It is at this moment that director Michael Mann institutes a trick, the likes of which hasn't been seen since All The President's Men. The two exchange a cat-and-mouse conversation via fax. Bergman finally calls Wigand's bluff by daring him to meet him the next day. He does.What does Wigand know? Well, its all over the papers these days about how the tobacco industry lied about manipulating the leaves to make them more habit forming. We have Wigand to thank for that. But that isn't where the story ends. This is a two-fold tale; on one hand you have the self-destruction of a man who put everything on the line just so he could do the right thing. On the other, you have a television producer who so believes in the integrity of himself, the network, and his show that he is willing to risk everything he has to fight for the protection of his source. I haven't seen this much commitment outside of Woodward and Berstein's staunch protection of \"Deep Throat.\"The trump card of this film though comes in the form of Christopher Plummer playing one of the most visible news figures of the past 25 years, Mike Wallace. Wallace teeters on the edge of looking like a foul-mouthed, celebrity hungry, media hound who's only thought is about ratings. However, before its over, he evokes the \"integrity of Edward R. Murrow,\" a line that gave me chills and made me pray for an Oscar Nomination.Director Michael Mann is known chiefly for his Action/Thrillers. This 155 minute film is slow paced but gripping for ever second it is on the screen. A lot of people have complained over the past 7-8 years about Pacino's \"staccato\" performances, suddenly shouting at the slightest provocation. This film returns him to his prime form, a style he hasn't walked in since Dog Day Afternoon, ...And Justice For All and Serpico.Anybody got a light?",

In 99.99% of the cases, the answer is: not very far, not when your job, your family, and your life is on the line.\"The Insider\", a 1999 film directed by Michael Mann, dramatizes the true story of two men who stopped at nothing to get out their story - Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) and Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) though they are thwarted every time they turn around.Michael Mann assembled a stellar cast - besides Crowe and Pacino, there is Christopher Plummer playing Mike Wallace, Diane Venora as Wigand's wife, Lindsay Crouse as Bergman's wife, Colm Feore as a Mississippi attorney, Gina Gershon as the CBS attorney, Michael Gambon as Thomas Sandefur, the head of Brown & Williamson Tobacco, Philip Baker Hall as Don Hewitt, and some Broadway people, including Roger Bart and Lynne Thigpen.Jeffrey Wigand was a whistle-blower on his former employer, Brown & Williamson, claiming that the company was aware that nicotine was addictive and was using a carcinogen called coumarin in their cigarettes, though the \"seven dwarfs\" as Wigand called them, the big seven tobacco companies, all had lied in hearings about nicotine being addictive.That's only part of the story. Wigand loses everything in his attempt to tell the truth - he is fired from his job, he has to sell his house, his family is terrorized until his wife and children finally leave him, a smear campaign is started against him, he is slapped with restraining orders, threatened with arrest, his computer is confiscated. And then the worst cut of all - 60 Minutes decides not to air the interview after pressure from the CBS Corporation. Tobacco, it seems, with its billions of dollars, can do whatever it takes to silence someone.Lowell Bergman, realizing that his source has been left out to dry, goes to bat for him in order to get the interview aired, and turns the tables on CBS, risking his own career and relationships with people with whom he has worked for years. He finds out along the way what these people were made of -- not much. In the end, Wallace cares only about his career and legacy, and Don Hewitt bows to CBS. Bergman wins by playing the ultimate hardball and humiliating 60 Minutes.This is a long film but a very gripping story. It takes its time to build instead of rushing the drama without fleshing out the characters. By the end of the film, we know who all of these people are.I remember seeing this in the theater. It was very powerful in 1999, and it's even more powerful today. Why? Because I think there are way fewer Wigands and Bergmans in the world than there were 11 years ago, and it was a dwindling population then - people whose integrity is more important than money.

            "content": "\"Miami Vice\" creator Michael Mann's hard-hitting expose about journalistic integrity in the controversial tobacco lawsuit involving whistle blower Jeffry Wigand is a devastating study about freedom of the press in a capitalistic society. Initially, when I saw \"The Insider\" for the first time, I thought it was going to be strictly about Wigand and the obstacles that he had to overcome to reveal the truth about the tobacco industry. Instead, \"The Insider\" concerns former CBS-TV producer Lowell Bergman's reputation as an honest man. Everything starts out with Bergman receiving a box of documents about the burn rate of cigarettes involved in fires that kill people who go to sleep with lighted cigarettes. Bergman peruses the documents, but he doesn't understand them so he searches for somebody who can explain to him what the documents mean. He crosses paths with a tobacco industry executive, Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe of \"Romper Stomper\"), who has just been fired from a company because he suffers a crisis of conscience. Wigand's former employers threaten to cut all his severance package unless he inks more confidential documents. Ultimately, he refuses to concede to Thomas Sandefur's demands. Not only does Wigand lose his comfortable house but also he eventually loses his wife. Meanwhile, Bergman assures Wigand that he has his best interests at heart and he won't betray him. CBS News is set to broadcast a segment on its television magazine news program \"60 Minutes\" with Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer of \"Triple Cross\") questioning him about the truth about nicotine and its hazards. The Big Tobacco companies swing into action and feed scandalous material to The Wall Street Journal when they are slapping restraining orders on Wigand. Interestingly enough, the state of Mississippi and Attorney General Mike Moore (Mike Moore) with Richard Scruggs depose Wigand. Just when things are looking good, CBS-TV gets a case of cold feet and runs their story without Wigand's interview. Bergman becomes a whistle blower in his own company and talks to a \"New York Times\"newspaper reporter about the scandal while at the same time he convinces \"The Wall Street Journal\" not to publish an expose about Wigand that is made up with half-truths and contradictions. In the end, CBS-TV broadcasts the Wigand interview, but Bergman quits because he knows that he cannot be honest in the future with other prospective news makers. Mann and scenarist Eric Roth deliver both barrels of a double-barreled shotgun indictment that is memorable and damning. The tobacco industry almost got away with scaring not just a whistle blower but also a national news organization. Al Pacino is wonderful as Bergman, and Russell Crowe convinces us that he is the man under the microscope who had everything to lose except his conscientiousness. People who boast about America as a bastion of freedom and journalism as an objective industry free of bias should watch this film and think about what it means. Audiences that crave action and entertainment may find this sizzling expose boring because little in the way of gripping or suspenseful action transpires during its two hour plus running time. Nevertheless, as a whistle blower saga, \"The Insider\" is insightful stuff that should be watched. Mann's film received seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.",

The story is of a quick-paced nature, and demands that the viewer pay the utmost attention to every single line and image presented;  it flabbergasts in its unparallelled structure of continuity and coherence to those sentient enough.After watching this film, it became apparent why Crowe was so reluctant to play the role of Maximus in \"Gladiator\" after acting the part of Jeffrey Wigand.  It appears more or less as if Crowe had been this character in reality, and it really inspires to see that such a talented actor is finally beginning to  enjoy the prominence that he deserves.In the past decades, there has been a progressive decline in the number of intelligent films making it onto the market, but the success of \"The Insider\" will hopefully serve as a shout-out to all the film companies and directors reluctant to tread on such sensitive ground.  This movie could not receive a higher recommendation!",

            "content": "I first wanted to see 'The Insider' because it professed to show the truth behind the lies of the Tobacco Industry. My wife and I saw it and were thoroughly impressed. In fact we've now seen it 5 times (I think, though I may have lost count).If you go to the movies to be entertained mindlessly, do NOT see this movie, you will bored. This movie is for people who like to think, and who like to receive superior presentation of thought provoking material. The Insider has all that.The movie gets you thinking about mankind. The obvious problem with human nature is obvious in this movie. The Tobacco companies knowingly selling addictive product, whilst claiming it is not. And then almost, almost but not quite, getting away with ruining an individual's life, an individual who's conscience was pricked by what they had seen.But then it moves into the CBS drama, where again the hopelessness of mankind in general shines through. The strength of two individuals though manages to win the day, which is what makes this true story so unusual.I found that (contrary to those who complained of the movies length) every scene that Mann has given us has a reason. A good reason. From the opening scenes depicting an evil far from USA. To the hints as to why we didn't hear anything about the drama when it happened, because the OJ murder story and media frenzy drowned out what should be to us all a much more serious matter.For me the crowning moment in the film was when Russell Crowe (as Wigand) was about to dig into a hamburger when behind him on TV a newscaster reported findings about him, bad (though unfounded) findings. Crowe put his knife and fork back down in a way that told us all that he had no more appetite, in fact all the will left in him had been violently thrust away, thrust away by the selfish interests of the Tobacco companies.All in all this is a complete movie that deserved its 7 nominations and should have gotten some awards. The sound was great, as was the camera work. If you love an artistic movie, you will love this one. Crowe is thoroughly believable and has cemented himself as a first rate actor, capable of playing just about any part put his way. Pacino is very well cast, Plummer is a class act, and a host of supporting cast did themselves proud.What we can't forget about this movie, for all its drama, and for the pointed view it gives us of the nature we bear, its a TRUE STORY. Thats what really makes it shocking. And only those driven to the ends of despair and loneliness such as Wigand and Bergmann were, can really truly realise another fact pointed out in the movie, in the end of it all, we are nothing anyway, so what does it all matter?See it!",

            "content": "I have been a huge Michael Mann fan for years, but I do have to admit that I approached his latest film \"The Insider\" with just the teensiest bit of trepidation...after all, Mann is the godfather of the thinking man's action flick, and I've even heard it said that his action sequences are so integral to his movie that they are practically another character in the film...with which I completely agree.  So I was wondering how a movie with no chase sequence, no gunfights, basically no action whatsoever--well, how could that possibly qualify as an authentic Michael Mann signature film?Yes, the action, per se, is missing, but Mann still brings his signature directorial style to life with lots of wide shots, intense close ups, and indirect focus, all bathed in cool blue light and threaded together with an inventive soundtrack (including a reprise of a former track that was used so effectively in \"HEAT\"; sorry, I can't recall the title offhand).And what the movie lacks in \"action\", Mann more than makes up for in high-wire tension.  He pulls us into the drama of an ordinary man's life by portraying the myriad humiliations, both large and small, that assault Wigand from the moment he is fired from his job as an R&D VP for a major tobacco company.  The detoriation of his life, from his finances to his marriage to his belief in himself, is explored with the sort of atmospheric detail that is Mann's trademark:  the play of light or lack of it; the familiar sights and sounds of everyday life, from the patterns of rain on a windshield to the rush of wind through the trees; and camera work that ranges from tight, out-of-focus shots to sweeping panoramas of razor-sharp clarity...all of this creates an environment of realism that puts you into the film.  You can't just observe Wigand's struggle; you experience it with him.  My movie-watching partner observed as we left the theatre that he felt exhausted from the tension, as if he'd just been through the corporate wringer himself.  I knew what he meant!But atmosphere isn't all Mann delivers.  Once again, this genius director has placed an unexpected actor in the lead role of his film, with amazing results.  Before Daniel Day Lewis was \"Nathaniel Poe\" in \"The Last of The Mohicans\", no one would have believed he could pull off a major hunk-o-rama role...well, guess what?  He ended up defining the hero of the adventure/romance genre!  In \"The Insider\", Mann has opted for the opposite effect, casting  young, potential hunk material Russell Crowe as an older, slightly-pot-bellied father of two.  Wigand doesn't look like anyone's hero, and perhaps that's actually the message of the movie:  an ordinary man--a nobody, really--caught up in extraordinary circumstances.  And Crowe delivers...in a major way!  Personally, I can't remember an acting performance that mesmerized me to this extent...unless it was the last time I watched Crowe, in \"L.A. Confidential\".  He evokes his character in this movie with the apparent ease of a magician doing card tricks:  the illusion is complete and appears to be effortless.  Even with silver, receding hair and twenty extra pounds which, we are shown, is not the result of costume padding, but Crowe's own amplified flesh, he is imminently watchable... almost hypnotically so.There are, even as I post this, whispers and rumors about this movie being an Oscar contender.  Best director, best actor, best supporting actor. Again, I can only nod my head in complete and total agreement.  Russell Crowe will blow you away, and Al Pacino gives his best performance in years.This film is quiet, intense, and ultimately, extremely moving.  I literally burst into tears twice, the way you do when you've recieved bad news or seen something dreadful, so complete was my empathy for the character of Jeffrey Wigand . The anger, helplessness, and puzzled confusion at being punished for telling the truth felt all too familiar to me.In summary, I was not at all disappointed in Mann's direction of this film. Even without the phenomenal action sequences he's known for, this film had the same visceral effect on me that I experienced when I saw Manhunter, Last of the Mohicans, and HEAT.  I'm a born-again fan!",

Disney had no idea how to market \"The Insider\" and essentially sold it as tobacco movie and it is so much more. Pacino gives a grand A plus performance as a Long Island Jewish producer and halfway through the movie I forgot he was Al Pacino. Even better Christopher Plummer masterfully captures the full essence of Mike Wallace. Gina Gershon could turn lust from a stone as always. Michael Mann seems to always pull strong performances from his actors, and Eric Roth who brilliantly adapted \"Forrest Gump\" did the same here with Mann.

Michael Mann, known for classics such as \"Heat\" and \"The Last of the Mohicans\", has collected immense amount of testimonies, news reports and transcripts of \"60 Minutes\" regarding the case, and with some help from Eric Roth of Forest Gump and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button fame wrote a screenplay for \"The Insider.\" With its length that stretches far beyond two hours and everything said so far, it is true that this is not a movie for every type of audience. But, to think even for a moment that this movie is slow and boring would be an enormous mistake. Somewhat controversial and omnipresent topic about the power of corporation, business and money over information and truth is masterfully crafted into an intense flick.Al Pacino and Russel Crowe are absolutely sensational in their main roles. Pacino is completely at home playing a witty, persistent and passionate journalist Lowell Bergman, while Crowe, being 33 at the time, simply dominates in his Oscar nominated role of Jeffrey Wigand, an erratic chemist in his early 50's whose life is getting more and more out of hand during the whole movie. With great support from, we can say, an ensemble cast of supporting actors of whom even the ones who are least known to wider audiences are doing an excellent job, and with the two Academy Awards winners we mentioned above, the movie nails its main goal and represents the two main themes extremely well.On the one hand, we have a great representation of often disregarded importance of investigative journalism in a world of capitalism. Numerous and serious obstacles faced even by an adept journalist of great reputation when dealing with a delicate story are masterfully presented as well. On the other hand, we have a thorough, realistic and detailed story of a scientist who has to abandon his ideals of improving the environment, and life of a man in general, in order to provide for his family. The magic of the whole thing is the fact that the movie does an outstanding job of showing the audience why, after a hard an unfair defeat while trying to get the truth out in the open, in the moments of despair, we don't have the right to stop, and we mustn't give up.All of this is crowned with Michael Mann's directing. He has an incredible eye for detail and the ability to hold a viewer's attention even in those seemingly slow and boring parts of the movie by making a hypnotizing atmosphere just by accenting some sound effect, like rustling of leafs on a light wind, for example.91/100",

The issues of whistle blowing and doing the right thing. In my view both the main characters are heroes. The fact that this is based on a true story makes it that much more fascinating.Pacino and Crowe both, in my opinion, gave flawless performances and both were excellent at drawing the viewer in(let me change that) SWEEPING the viewer in to their lives and the things they were fighting for. There are many movies that take on important issues but lack the ability to keep the movie interesting. That's not the case here as the movie literally simmers from start to finish and through the last hour or so, I don't think I moved. That's the type of film this is and it is absolutely outstanding.This was one of the best roles I've seen Al Pacino in and though I have not seen a lot of Crowe's work, he is wonderful here and well cast.The supporting cast was wonderful too. There have been so many movies made about deception and dishonesty, it's nice to see a movie where the main characters are courageous and heroic. The Insider is all at once absorbing, disturbing, thought provoking and triumphant. In other words, it's everything a good movie should be. This is a long movie but the time goes very quickly and it's not the type of movie that could have been any shorter. (It actually could have been even longer.)

Rarest of all is that special movie that is both good and important. Michael Mann's The Insider is just such a film.Mann's best-known efforts to date are the films Heat and Last of the Mohicans. This film demands a more subtle and sophisticated guiding hand and Mann clearly rises to the challenge. The Insider is the somewhat fictionalized, but basically true, story of Jeffrey Wigand (played by Russell Crowe), a tobacco executive turned whistle blower. It is also the story of Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), a passionate producer who becomes a whistle-blowing insider in his own right.The subject matter of the film places it in the tradition of films like Silkwood, The China Syndrome, and A Civil Action. When Wigand agrees to go on the record exposing the cover-ups and perjury by tobacco industry executives he is harassed, threatened, betrayed, and abandoned. The real story here though is how CBS was bullied into softening and burying the story. Pacino's performance as the passionate producer with integrity provides the moral center of the film.It should come as no surprise that this is a good film. In addition to Mann's capable direction, there are some excellent performances by Crowe (who viewers might remember as Bud White in LA Confidential) and Pacino. Christopher Plummer also does superior work in his less than flattering portrayal of Mike Wallace. The screenplay is adapted from a short story by one of the masters of adaptation, Eric Roth (Forrest Gump, The Horse Whisperer). Cinematographer Dante Spinotti uses color, light, and shadows to infuse the story with rich visual symbols. This is a good film by a team of gifted artists.But this is also an important film. It would be a mistake to see this film as simply a film about the tobacco industry or the co-optation of the news industry. Ultimately, it is about corporate power in its broadest sense. It was especially interesting watching this film on the weekend of the Microsoft monopoly ruling. The clear message of this film is that we all lose when the bottom line of corporate profits is our only moral compass. We live in a society desperately in need of prophetic critique and moral pronouncement. The Insider does not say all that needs to be said, but it provides a welcome start to a much-needed dialogue.",

I guess that it's debatable whether or not Al Pacino eclipses him as producer Lowell Bergman, but both men do very well in their roles. I agree with a previous reviewer that Crowe's role here deserves more recognition (maybe even more than \"Gladiator\").Anyway, this is a very important movie.

Wingard is contacted by \"60 Minutes\" producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) who convinces Wingard to tell his story to 30 million viewers, this despite legal action and ugly threats from his former employer. Director Michael Mann takes his time setting up this character-driven piece; he's careful to include lots of high drama, though one must wade through many story incidentals to get to the meat of the piece (the television news show caving under pressure from the network's legal advisers, and then admitting their cowardice and doing the right thing). The performances (which really drive the picture) are outstanding. Pacino is able to root out the helplessness of the producer's situation, feeling great empathy for his client but also with the knowledge his own career is on the line. Ethics and morality come in second in this man's circle, and standing up for one's principles is to be labeled a martyr. Christopher Plummer gives an Oscar-worthy performance as \"60 Minutes\" anchor Mike Wallace, and Philip Baker Hall is equally strong as show-creator Don Hewitt. Wallace and Hewitt's loyalty to each other--and how that affects their working relationship with Pacino's Bergman--provides riveting drama, while Crowe's floundering Smoking Gun (one with a hair-trigger temper) is completely realized by the actor. Though assembled in a smoothly astute manner, \"The Insider\" is quite long. It takes at least an hour to get cooking, yet the final events are truly gripping and moving. *** from ****",

            "content": "This film, like \"Good Night and Good Luck\", sends a clear message to me and hopefully to movie makers everywhere: we need more movies highlighting social and political issues, and we need more media outlets with some integrity.This film, directed by Michael Mann (\"Miami Vice\"), has given me a new respect for Mann and also for Russell Crowe, who I thought was not good for much besides getting sweaty and punching people. Crowe is a winner here, and alongside Al Pacino (who can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned) we have a dynamic duo on par with Batman and Robin.The story is of a tobacco executive (Crowe) who turns against his former employer with the help of a media producer (Pacino). With lawsuits a death threats the tobacco industry tries to stop them. I was not sure how the film was going to end because it keeps twisting and turning and although the true story did not happen long ago it was not one I was familiar with.I'm not going to critique the music or the directing or the acting or any other aspect of this film, other than to say it was excellent. The film was a bit on the long side, but this was not a bad quality in any way. I never felt a scene was wasted and the pacing was good enough to keep me engrossed. I admit I should have been sleeping for work but this movie held me to my screen.The Pepsi girl was in this film... who is almost as creepy as the Welch's grape juice girl. I don't know why I feel the need to mention that, but I do. Someday when I can't remember those commercials any more I will probably appreciate this actress more.Anyway, great film. See it.",

Wigand was a disgruntled former ex employee of a tobacco giant persuaded by Pacino to tell his story of the industry and its methods of getting people hooked on cigarettes. The details boring and irrelevant for the purpose of this review. Involved were the cigarette companies threats of litigation,violence and blackmail. CBS backed down and than we had a surprise whistleblower in Lowell Bergman- Al Pacino. Christopher Plummer was excellent as well playing '60 Minutes' anchor Mike Wallace. This screenplay hit the mark and highlighted the world of the investigative reporter as well as the News industry in general and the power the large corps have , as far as manipulating the newsworthy issues. Unfortunately, fascism is alive and well in America. Based on a true story, thankfully we still have a couple of men of integrity like Wigand and Bergman.

            "content": "I hope I can say this under IMDb guidelines, but THE INSIDER is a little disappointing after the mighty HEAT.  It's not that it's a bad film  - on the contrary, it's a rare Hollywood film that treats its subject with seriousness, irony and complexity.  Unfortunately, it shares the classical epic's delusion that somehow length confers greater worthiness, and so we get a lot of dragged out scenes of people just staring, which perhaps gives a truer sense of what it must be like for ordinary people in such circumstacnes - the sheer tedious dread - but dissipates, in contradiction of the closing credits, the film's 'dramatic effect'.In many ways similar to ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN (as has been pointed out) - an investigation into 'respectable' corruption (in this case the Columbia-like addiction-mongering of tobacco companies) - it is also that film's complete opposite.  Whatever its flaws, Pakula's film was shaped as a thriller, had the exciting momentum of a thriller, the driving sense of two detective figures bringing enlightenment to a depressingly murky situation.\nThere was always a large element of wish-fulfilment about this.  For a start, the case had already been won, the film felt like retreading old victories.  But most seriously, the shadowy Establishment network that allowed Watergate to happen was never punctured - Nixon was a scapegoat, things were allowed to get back to normal.  This is half-suggested in Pakula's tireless determination to make a conspiracy thriller out of everything, but the essential American faith in right and truth outing was generally asserted.Michael Mann is too good a director to settle for this.  His film does follow a feel-good arc - revelation of corruption, suppression of revelation, eventual revelation of revelation - which suggests that men of truth and honour can defeat proto-fascist corporate power.  And there is, like THREE KINGS, a sense that audiences wouldn't be able to handle a more realistic ending.But Mann ironises this arc at every turn.  His hero is Lowell Bergman, a CBS news producer with a reputation for securing great stories in some of the world's most dangerous hot-spots.  He is played by Al Pacino, an actor in the grandstanding manner, who, despite many villainous roles, carries with him a dogged, Spencer Tracy-like integrity.  In following his point-of-view, we get to see the development of the plot and the workings of corporate power.In the opening sequecne, as Bergman is being driven through Iran, we see what he sees - when he looks in a particular direction, the camera follows. The thing is, he doesn't see anything, he is blindfolded - the traditional treatment to the Hollywood hero has been brilliantly subverted, and undermines Bergman as a hero thorughout the film.For instance, when Bergman, trying to persuade Wigand to talk, suggest, idealistically, information is power at a Japanese restaurant.  Mann frames the two men sitting in the traditional Japanese manner, almost legless, not looking very powerful at all.So in a film where there is an awful  lot of talk adn exposition, it is crucial that Mann's irony gives us, the audience, the real view, as in that first sequence.  A recurrent motif is Bergman standing godlike from a balcony looking out over a huge city - he does not survey all he sees; it's an impenetrable blank to him.  Just as the plot slips away from him, he talks to Wigand on the phone on a beach- Mann cuts to him wading in the water like King Canute.  This subtle ironising makes it all the more credible when this blustering hero, totally in control, driving the plot with ariculate confidence, is suddenly shown to have very little real power at all.Wigand isn't ironised in quite the same way - he is in a more passive position, defending his family, repository of information.  BUt his introduction also shows how removed he is from the real world.  WE see him first in his office which looks onto a staff canteen - the realms are only separated by a glass wall, but they could be two different worlds - his dark, lonely,furtive, suffocating, sinister (we don't know what he's doing, but it looks very secretive), dislocatingly cut with the friendly, communal, human babble of the canteen.  WHen he goes to leave the building, the camera slows down, the sound is blocked out, the light brightens, adn Wigand looks like he's entering a dream or fairytale world.THis ironising is crucial, because the film takes on a feel-good turn.  At first it suggest taht truth can be recorded, delivered to the public, despite the flexing of corporate muscle.  When this threatens , there are alternative means of diffusion.  BUt look  at thow Wigand's testimony is recorded.  We see the testimony split into different screens, teh 'real' Wigand and his screen image.  Lter we see Bergman editing the piece, rearranging the truth to achieve it more powerfully.  There is no such thing as an unmediated 'pure' truth, and although this might seem rather obvious, it sours the heric sense of the truth finally getting out to the public. Also disturbing is the possiblity, that never actually occured to me until the smear attacks, that Wigand might be lying.  WE are given no evidence adn are expected to take this man's word.  THE idea of anyone's 'word' being simply enough is so rejected by the film that itt further undermines the optimistic intentions, and this is never resolved withing the film.  Is there somehow an abstract 'truth' thast can be extracted from the deeply compromised eople that utter it?All this is great - and there are some interesting insights about families (although not, as ever with MANN, women) adn imiplications about the wider sphere of political and media corruptoin - but the film is too subversive for its own good.  It undermines its heroes, its themes, its genre, its mode of representation, its setting.  THis is all necessary adn brilliant, but it doesn't leave much for a film, certainly at this lentgh.  Unlike ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN - a film about actively seeking a well-defined truth - THE INSIDER is about defending a compromised truth - and this passivity means that it can never work as a thriller - you keep waiting for something to happen adn it doesn't.  It can't.",

One man is Jeffery Wigand (Russell Crowe) who was a scientist with the tobacco company Brown & Williamson. He had critical knowledge about the chemicals being used in cigarettes, but was not allowed to share it due to a confidentiality agreement he had with the company.The other man was Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) who was a producer for the show \"60 Minutes.\" CBS corporate wanted to squash the Mike Wallace interview with Wigand that would expose the entire tobacco industry and Lowell was trying every trick he knew to get that interview televised.This movie was about the importance of the media in bringing certain scandals and travesties to light while also showing how the media can be controlled when certain interests are threatened. Running parallel to that was the story of a man conflicted. He could violate his confidentiality agreement, possibly be imprisoned due to such a violation, and lose everything or keep quiet and let the multi-billion dollar tobacco company continue to do what they do.This movie reminded of movies such as \"All the King's Men\" and \"Kill the Messenger\" which focused on relentless journalists exposing government corruption. I like the idea of journalists not beholden to the state who go in and expose corruption to the American people.\"The Insider\" was properly done. They took the time necessary to develop the plot and hone in on details to stress the significance of it all. Pacino was wonderful as the idealistic SJW producer willing to stand up to the likes of CBS and Crowe was a close second to Pacino.

If you are not a fan of 60 Minutes, you might be after this film. It's one of the most incredible news hours on television. I always watch the show on Sunday nights. Anyway, this film is inspired by the actual events that brought a segment to life despite the possible devastation and possible ruin of CBS and 60 Minutes. Russell Crowe played Dr. Jeffrey Wigrand, a tobacco industry scientist, who gets fired and realized his industry's lies. Somehow Pacino played Lowell Bergman, the 60 Minutes producer, who gets the story with Wigrand's interview which could shatter the tobacco industry's image as ignorant about the effects of smoking. Well, I think this film belongs to Pacino because he's brilliant in the role. Crowe does a brilliant performance as Wigrand, torn between his family and the truth. Christopher Plummer should have gotten an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as Mike Wallace. There are not many actors who could have pulled off Mike Wallace but Plummer does a brilliant job that was ignored at Oscar time. Still the cast is brilliant with Lindsay Crouse as Bergman's wife; Debi Mazar as his assistant; Diane Venora as Mrs. Wigrand.",

Which isn't to say one half is better than the other - this is an extremely watchable film, start to finish - just that you can almost feel Edward R. Murrow's spirit looming large over the proceedings as the power of the press is (almost) smothered by Big Tobacco.Either way, this remains one of my favorite Michael Mann films, almost sneakily compelling as it contains no shootouts, hit men or neon atmosphere.

How can a movie about a lawsuit be so captivating, astonishing, touching and thrilling from beginning to end? Well, seeing is believing and watching \"The Insider\" is the ultimate proof that a seemingly boring story about a lawsuit can have such a powerful impact. This movie is many things, it's a drama, a thriller and criticism of the suffocating entanglement of corporate industry with journalism.The true story by itself is already amazingly shocking, but the way it is directed, photographed, acted and scored is truly magnificent as well. Lots of praise for the terrific acting performances by Al Pacino and Russel Crowe, who lift this movie to a higher level.This movie is based on a true story about the secret injection of chemical ingredients in cigarettes, which were added by the tobacco company with the sole effect/purpose of enhancing addiction to smoking. One insider scientist (Russel Crowe), who worked for the tobacco industry decides to become a whistleblower and consequently gets attacked viciously with all means possible by the tobacco industry. Al Pacino plays the part of a 60 minutes news reporter who wants to air an interview with the whistleblower, but suddenly finds himself entangled with corporate powers who try to stop him.Endnotes: in 1998 in real life, the tobacco industry settled the lawsuits filed against it by mississippi and 49 other states for 246 BILLION DOLLARS.The deadly impact of its tobacco products cost the world's economies more than 1000 billion dollars annually in healthcare expenditures and lost productivity. Globally, there are 1100 million tobacco smokers aged 15 or older. Currently, around 6 million people die ANNUALY as a result of tobacco use.",

            "content": "If there's one thing I hate about certain movies, it is that they are too \"black and white\". I'm not talking pigmentation, though, but rather the depth of the plot and characters. Life is too complicated and filled with shades of gray to be simplified at the theater, and I'm glad \"The Insider\" doesn't pander in that fashion.For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), a former \"Big Tobacco\" scientist who must decide whether to keep the trade secrets, or blow the whistle on the most powerful business entity in the U.S. On the story is journalist Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), who (against his ethical code) becomes personally involved with Wigand and as such gets drawn even deeper into the business intrigue.There is nothing simple about this film: Should Wigand do the interview and put his family in danger all in the name of \"ethics\"? Should Bergman take the case to another level at the expense of HIS future? Nearly ever situation in the movie will make you contemplate what is \"right\" or \"wrong\".What really makes this solid film into a 5-star experience, though, is the acting of Pacino. I never really got into Pacino's earlier mob flicks, but his later-years work (like here) really impresses me. Does he play essentially the same character all the time? Absolutely. But it doesn't matter in the slightest because he is so incredible at it. The most natural \"intense guy\" actor I've ever seen.Thus, \"The Insider\" is a great movie that will draw you in with the engaging plot, incredible acting, and the real-life setting based on a true story. I can't vouch for the film's historical accuracy, but as a stand-alone film it deserves all the Oscar nominations it garnered.",

            "content": "Michael Mann's The Insider is perhaps one of the most accomplished thrillers I've ever seen, a nigh on two and a half hour battle through turmoil; plight; anguish and terror so as to show up those evil enough to do what they do. The film, one of the very best of not only its respective year but the decade of the 1990s, is a thrilling; alarming and intuitive legal thriller based mostly on fact about the proverbial little guy suffering from fraught attacks of the conscience where those in the past have blazed through unabashed before eventually going on a campaign with the view to triumph over megalomania. In all of its runtime, there is barely a dull nor uninteresting moment; Mann effectively going on to tell two tales of hard-edged and immense confrontation that is never anything less that wholly fascinating as it juggles character with narrative with a real sense of filmmaking.One of the two chief protagonists is Al Pacino's Lowell Bergman, a journalist more specifically tied to a television news production named \"60 minutes\"; our first sight of this man highlighting his unwavering ability to deal with what seems a rather hair raising situation when he occupies a small room, blindfolded, and manages to swing an interview with a stiff and uneasily moved Lebanon based Sheikh. Once a worker for a publication entitled 'Ramparts Magazine', the inferring that he has come a long way in his chosen field feels prominent. As things unfold, he'll go on to become more deeply involved in the affairs of Russell Crowe's Jeffrey Wigand; a recently fired tobacco company executive whom drives home to distorted editing and cold blue hues as the reaction to being let go settles on his mind. The few fleeting moments we see of the man at his office has him observe the staff party going on next door as he packs away his things alone, the sense of him being an outsider; disconnected or disenchanted with those of whom he works prominent - nobody is seeing him off, and this disconnection or alienation to his workplace or company comes to feature prominently later on. His wife is Liane (Venora), one of his two young daughters is Barbara (Eisenberg) whom suffers from asthma.Their coming together is through a series of crude and unspecific faxes they send to each another, Bergman's receiving of numerous tobacco company documents sees him contact Wignard for specificities on the subject. One thing leads to another and his ex-tobacco company, representative of Michal Gambon's cold and methodical in tone but large and imposing and authoritative in figure, megalomaniac calls him in to reach some sort of confidentiality deal. Crowe's character is seated in-front of his former boss as another employee looms anonymously as well as ominously behind Crowe whilst cut off at the shoulders; the deal he's called in for breaking down and causing all manner of antagonism and conflict. The resulting threats cause them to revoke his medical related compensation after being fired, meaning they are effectively targeting doing young Barbara harm and are therefore even more efficient as the villains of the piece.Mann's film is a documenting of the plump, bleary-eyed and somewhat weedy looking Wignard going up against this company with the keen and effectual Bergman. On most of the occasions Crowe's character occupies the screen, he's shot in an unflattering manner; his ambling and stumbling frame not particularly complimenting his overall build and going hand-in-hand with the relatively concurrent close ups of his facial features that dominate the frame: his expression rendered desperate and this working particularly well during the instances in which Wignard is on the telephone so as to capture this grossly unflattering look. The interplay is illuminating, the observing of this man in Wignard just having his life crumble in-front of him born out of the threats his ex-company implant onto him and the paranoia he carries that Bergman is merely in it for himself as a journalistic coup is morbidly fascinating.Mann balances each of the respective plights ingeniously; where he has his audience sympathise with Crowe, he has them associate themselves with Pacino as this outsider to both the story and the finer details of the case. Where it's established the tobacco company are evil, sinful, grotesquely amoral, loathsome and downright putrid in their actions anyway, Mann has them simultaneously deny nicotine as a suspiciously addictive material as well as demean the war dead when a small but revealing little moment sees Wignard's vehicle pause beside a Second World War memorial graveyard as Wignard sits in the foreground while the man travels to speak openly about things his ex-employers would prefer aren't revealed: the exercising of one's freedom of speech over which those in the graveyard we have resonating in the background essentially died for, and the same freedom of speech the imperialist mega-corporation essentially wish to suppress or take away, feeling prominent. Mann's The Insider is a quite brilliant dramatisation of some eerily true-to-life events, one of the best legal thrillers of recent times and a powerhouse of the filmmaking hallmarks in editing; direction; acting and cinematography combining to form something quite special.",

Even supporting characters have memorable scenes and dialogue in this movie, my favorite being the courtroom deposition of Wiegand (Crowe). This movie provides intensity on so many levels. There is action (not shootouts or car chases...), suspense, heroism, depression, hope - you name it. There is abundant complexity in the plot, especially in regard to Wiegand being pushed to the edge of sanity. Lisa Gerrard (vocals) is perfect as usual for adding drama and feeling.

            "content": "Whether the defendant is a squealer or a whistle blower depends on which side of the social border the judge sits on. If the informant betrays secrets about an organization we support, then he's a squealer or a spy. If we hate the organization, then he's a civic-minded whistle blower. It's kind of like being a \"terrorist\" or a \"freedom fighter.\"In this case, there's no doubt that Jeffrey Wigand was a flawed but full-blown whistler. He tattled on \"Big Tobacco,\" as it's consistently called, a conspiratorial corporate entity everyone hates. What did he have to gain? Not much. He admits to having a bad temper and feels he was fired \"for no good reason,\" but for most of us that would be a weak motive for risking your bountiful severance package and your family. (Of course, who knows what's in a man's heart?) There are death threats that show up on his PC and a bullet appears in his mailbox, or so we are told. People may be \"surveilling\" him at places like a golf driving range. If so, the surveillers are pretty obvious about it. Writers, and viewers as well, need to be careful with this kind of material. After he was sent to jail, G. Gordon Liddy, a paranoid if there ever was one, describes in his book, \"Will,\" how he made killer enemies in prison and concluded that on a given night they were going to make an attempt on his life. He chose bravely to sleep out in the open with a blunt object for defense nearby. Nobody showed up that night. He believes his audacity frightened the killers off, whereas most reasonable readers would suspect that his enemies, like Son of Sam's social life, were all in his head. At any rate, as it turns out, Wigand loses just about everything dear to him.Another brave whistle blower is Lowell Bergman the CBS producer who brings the whole tawdry story to light by blowing the whistle on CBS to the New York Times. He quits his job. (The movie makes it appear that he quits immediately after his victory, whereas in fact he didn't quit until two years later.) The movie is based on Bergman's version of events.The question is: aside from making us feel good because, by means of all this sacrifice Big Tobacco gets it in the chin, what other purpose is served? What startling exposition is there in Wigand's suppressed interview? Certainly not that cigarettes are bad for you. The Surgeon General's report demonstrated that in 1964. And even that report was a redundancy since just about everyone, from scientists to morons, knew that cigarettes make you ill. The first use of the term \"coffin nail\" or \"nail in your coffin\" used in reference to cigarettes appeared in 1888, when cigarettes were just beginning to be used in addition to cigars and pipes. Here's a headline from the Chicago Daily Tribune, 15 July 1897, \"Unconscious From Cigaret Smoke: George Decker of Jersey City Succumbs to an Excessive Use of 'Coffin Tacks.'\" (That's from Dictionary of American Regional English.) In Chinese, the character representing \"tobacco\" is the same as that for \"opium,\" a stylized picture of a man imprisoned by four walls.There is an interesting datum on how ammonia compounds are added to tobacco to facilitate the impact of nicotine -- but that's the whole point of smoking. No one ever claimed that cigarettes TASTED good. Enhancing the impact of nicotine is an example of good old American know-how.At least from what we can see, the two main contributions of the controversial interview are (1) that the CEOs lied when they testified that they did not believe tobacco was an addictive drug, and (2) sound bites -- \"Cigarettes are nothing more than a delivery system for a drug.\" (We hear that last bite quoted 3 times.)Well, Big Tobacco (and little tobacco for that matter, if that term can be applied to users) had already been demonized. The whole affair, in all its complexity, seems to have cemented even more firmly in place those prejudices most viewers will already hold. The film was careful not to indict smokers because, after all, these addicts go to the movies. The film poses as an expose, when in fact it has about the same sensational value as the revelation that Benedict Arnold sold West Point to the British.And who wound up paying for all this? Big Tobacco came under a great deal of expensive litigation, and remains there today. Penalties were levied on the corporations. The corporations passed these additional costs on to the users by tripling and quadrupling the cost of cigarettes. Most of the people who are addicted to cigarettes (we're not talking about the conspicuous consumption of expensive cigars) are working and lower class. The result is a regressive tax, in which the chief burden falls on those least able to pay. Forty years ago, a carton of Camels could be had for 90 cents. Today, in New York, you pay between five and six dollars a pack. That's an increase of roughly 6,111 percent. (I think. If that figure's wrong, it's my calculator's fault.)One might think that, having finally brought the addictive properties of nicotine out into the open, the public and its representatives would feel some sympathy, or even pity, for its victims, but no such sentiment has surfaced. The hatred we feel towards smokers seems boundless and almost gleeful. Here's a poster on the door of a professor of social science in an Eastern university: \"Cancer Cures Smoking,\" in huge blood-red letters. The last time there was such widespread and righteous wrath must have been during the anti-communist fervor of the early 1950s.In return we have the warm self-satisfied glow that comes from knowing that we rooted for the right side in this really rather simple-minded and exploitative movie.",

            "content": "Before I start, I should declare my bias up front; I have never understood the appeal of smoking.  Granted, I didn't grow up during the time when it was made to look cool in the movies, but I don't think it looks glamorous or stylish or any of that.  I can understand how some people will drink too much in that many alcoholic beverages actually taste good(I hope no one sees this as an endorsement of alcoholism, because it isn't), but cigarettes don't even taste good; it's just smoke.  I've always liked this routine I once heard where a comedian talked about smokers and their attitudes:\"Smoking doesn't affect me, I can still exercise,\" they say.  Then you walk up a flight of stairs with them, and all of a sudden they turn into Darth Vader(heavy breathing).  Meanwhile, there's Yoda on the railing going, \"Stunt your growth, it will.\"All that is to say I was predisposed to liking THE INSIDER before I even saw it, since it goes after the tobacco industry(anybody who thinks legalized drugs would improve things should consider how the tobacco industry has handled its own legalized drug).  But if that was all it did, it wouldn't be a complete movie.  Instead, THE INSIDER, and Michael Mann, also make this an indictment of the news industry, which is more concerned with industry than news, and a complex character study of two men.Admittedly, there are a few facts fudged here.  The most surprising thing is an omission; I'm not entirely clear on this, but wasn't one of the CBS executives related to someone at Brown & Williamson?  Also, while it's not true the movie gives credit to Lowell Bergman(Al Pacino) for manipulating a Wall Street Journal story(he merely gives them the other side of the story they were about to print), it doesn't give the paper enough credit for its own investigation(as Bergman in the movie points out, the Journal is not exactly known for going after big corporations).Still, this is a powerful movie.  One thing, as I said before, which makes it powerful is how it also goes after CBS, and in particular CBS News, for caving in to the possibility of a lawsuit(not a lawsuit, just the possibility of one).  And while Mike Wallace has criticized the film(though he has retracted that somewhat), the fact of the matter is if he had made a stink about it, CBS might not have caved in so easily.  And yet the film doesn't portray him as a bad guy, just someone who doesn't know if he has the fight left in him.And as a character study, of course, it's riveting.  Some people think this film is a departure for Mann from his usual crime dramas.  But Mann has also made films about flawed heroes(MANHUNTER, THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS), which Jeffrey Wigand certainly is, and like the characters in Mann's more famous films(THIEF, HEAT), Wigand is a man good at his job, but not good at expressing his feelings, and backed into a stand he didn't know he was going to have to take.  Russell Crowe has not always played characters with simmering intensity(think of PROOF, THE SUM OF US, or THE QUICK AND THE DEAD), but as L.A. CONFIDENTIAL showed, he's masterful at playing them, and shows it again here.  He walks like a man defeated at the beginning, when he's fired, and you can feel the longing he has just for things to be normal again.  But you can also see the intelligence and the man who refuses to be pushed around by anybody, whether it be the tobacco company or Bergman. Pacino is also quite good as Bergman, playing not a hero, but someone who also is pushed into a stand he didn't think he'd have to take.Oh yeah, and as usual for a Mann film, this looks incredible.  Just as ALL THE PRESIDENTS MEN(which this is being compared to) director Alan J. Pakula and cameraman Gordon Willis was able to visualize the creepiness of Watergate, here Mann and his cameraman, Dante Spinotti, emphasize how there's no black and white here by showing the gray areas visually.  All in all, this is a great film.",

What the film shows is a startling trip in 2 parts- 1: scientist Jeffrey Wigand's trouble with being a whistle blower (he wound up losing everything, but gaining everything); 2: producer Lowell Bergam's struggle to get Wigand's testimony on 60 Minutes without being sued.

The first act was far too intense and exciting for my own good. I think my feelings were intensified as the film is based on a real event and I had no idea how it would end as the plot of the film teetered between disaster and success.In one corner are Russell Crowe and Al Pacino, and in the other corner are all the greedy businessmen. Crowe has been fired from his job as a chemist at a tobacco company and he is sitting on a lot of secrets that he should tell. The company does everything it can to get him to shut up, while slick journalist Pacino tries to get Crowe to appear on his news show. Crowe finally decides to tell the truth and the consequences are devastating.No one portrays rounded and interesting characters like Michael Mann. The characters are so ruggedly well written with motives, unique personalities, and stories that are smoothly shown during the course of the film. Mann understands human psychology better than anyone. The characters in the film are indeed real people, but it is masterfully directed by Mann.It's very interesting how the different men think and reason, as well as how they develop through the film. Crowe is unsure if he made the right choice. Perhaps he made the right decision, but at what cost? His wife just wants to keep the family together and keep the nice benefits that his old job still provides the family with. Crowe gets into real trouble because he did the right thing. Not all stories like this always end well. Is it worth the risk to say something, or should you continue to live the lie?Crowe does the right thing and is promised that things will happen, but when it comes down to it, it doesn't turn out quite as he predicted. All the characters have their interests, but Pacino is the one who acts the least selfishly. Or does he? It's a question that Pacino wrestles with a bit in the film. Is he doing this to help Crowe? Or does he do it because he likes the kick it gives him? Or is he doing it to get a good show and make money?The film is about what the consequences can be for a man when other men forget their moral compass and do everything they can to climb higher in the workplace hierarchy. Pacino has a clear code of honor that he maintains. We have a good man there. The Insider is a riveting drama with superb characters and fine photography. 7.6/10.",

            "content": "The Insider (1999)Wow, this is a searing, amazing tour-de-force. It comes across as fearless, and you wonder just how it got the okay to tell as much truth as it does. It slams the tobacco industry and CBS Corporation equally (though CBS News, as such, rises above). It creates a fluid, fast, intelligible, and moving story involving several key players. And it avoids sentiment, clich\u00e9, and shock, which is sort of amazing for a Hollywood film right there.Add three amazing, central performances by men who take on their roles as if they needed to for their lives. First is Al Pacino, who often plays the righteous and indignant voice of justice, and he plays it with more justice here than ever. Then there is Russell Crowe, playing the \"insider\" himself, a tobacco industry chemist who spills the beans about the lies in the industry, and with real psychological subtlety. And then, in more of a surprise, Christopher Plummer plays one of Pacino's counterparts with perfect pitch.Anthony Mann deserves a huge hand for his role pulling this together. He has a deft touch. He handles big material (spectacular stuff, really) with a steady beat of conviction, as if the point is not drama, but resolution. The music is superb, making clear that this is of course still a drama, and the editing, easily overlooked, creates a relentless but not distracting pace, leaving little things hanging just enough to keep us in suspense without obscuring the narrative.I sound breathless in praise, and I suppose my one reservation is that the movie, since it is based on known facts (and uses real names throughout), lacks imagination. That's a bizarre comment, and not a complaint, exactly, but there is a sense when all is done that it was already known from the start. Getting there was amazing, but the result is a heightened version of what we know and see all the time in the news and in the corporate worlds. And sometimes elements are repeated too often (the video tape), so you can see a trimmed down version having even more impact.But let me go back to being breathless. This is an overlooked, wonderful movie. That it holds interest so well after a decade is only proof that it might continue to work as a movie, as a drama, long after the events are in textbooks, and CBS is bought up by someone else. And so the world turns. Check this out. You won't be disappointed.",

However, this movie provides a fascinating insight into the TV news business, and the tactics of the dirty, lying, money-grubbing tobacco companies and their CEOs and their lawyers.Al Pacino as usual does a fine job as the \"60 Minutes\" producer. Interestingly, the insider, Jeff Wigand and the B&W CEO are both played by British actors, Russell Crowe and Michael Gambon, but they both do credible jobs with \"American\" accents. Crowe, especially, is superb as Jeff Wigand.I saw this on DVD. Although it has a couple of interesting extras, including glimpses of some of the real characters, the DD 5.1 soundtrack is disappointing.

Only a director like Michael Mann could pull this of. It makes \"The Insider\" truly one of the greatest and most powerful movie of the last couple of years.In my view the movie can be split in two different parts. The first part is about Jeffrey Wigand, his family and the pressure he is put under while the second halve of the picture mainly focuses on Lowell Bergman and his struggle to get the taped interview with Wigand aired on television. The balance between these two parts is perhaps not always perfect and the movie at times focuses a bit too much on Wigand and his family. I know that it is important for the story and the character of Wigand to also tell the story of his family but I felt that at times it took away some of the continuity and pace.The movie works well and shows what the price of just wanting to be honest in a corrupt world can be.

            "content": "In telling the story of Jeffrey Wigand and Lowell Bergman's struggle to get the truth out, director Michael Mann was presented with two distinct goals. For one, he took on the duty of telling this important, human story to the audience. Also though, he had the difficult task of taking this story and turning it into an engaging, thrilling piece of film. There's a scene where a character discusses with Bergman how this story is something that matters, something has a national impact. For 60 Minutes, it could just be a piece of \"Sunday night entertainment...something to put on between commercials\", a story to grip the audience while they're eating their dinner. In creating The Insider it could have been the exact same thing, and part of it has to be that. Mann is given the difficult task of not only creating a piece of entertainment, a film to bring in audiences and keep them engaged for the 157 minute running time, but in taking on this particular story he also has to keep the integrity of it in tact, to make the audience aware and educated on the importance of Wigand's journey. In creating the film Mann found himself in a similar position to Bergman himself, and he pulled it off magnificently.Here Mann tells a story that really matters, something that resonates within the foundation of the American public, pulling apart a lie told against the foundation of our legal structure and shaking up the tobacco industry which had been man-handling people like Wigand and the American public for decades. This is a story that has to make a difference in the world, beyond just being a piece of entertainment. Michael Mann was the perfect director to take the wheel here because he, working from a script co-written by Eric Roth, knows just how to create a distinctively cinematic thriller but also has the intelligence to do justice to the real life people involved. Mann pieces together a precise, incredibly exciting thriller that's never dull for a moment but he also doesn't overly exaggerate events to the point where he betrays the people he is capturing on screen. He creates a film that is very cinematic, with his excellent staging and use of hand-held cameras, but is also very true. This truth then adds an even higher sense of tension to standard thriller scenes like the moment with Wigand at the driving range or searching for someone in his backyard.There is a scene where a lawyer, played by Colm Feore, that Wigand is working with talks to him about what Wigand is going through. He compares it to his experience in combat, noting the difference in the fact that combat lasts only a few seconds whereas Wigand's struggle lasts day after day, month after month and sinks into his entire life, leaving an impact on his family and his financial future. Watching Crowe's face in this moment, you can truly see the level of that impact on him. He is a good man in an unjust system, and Crowe takes us thoroughly into his anguished mind here. The extensive running time of the film gives ample opportunity for the audience to feel those walls slowly closing in on him. Nothing feels rushed or too undeveloped, but instead Mann and Crowe bring us on a slow descent with this character and watching him finally explode is a shattering moment.It's no secret to say that Al Pacino's work has taken quite the decline since his tremendous emergence in the '70s. Still, despite disappointing on most occasions he manages to every so often give a performance that is worthy of his legacy and remind the world what a powerful talent he truly is. His work as Lowell Bergman is one of the best examples of just that, portraying the former radical journalist who know works for the giant corporate network of CBS. Bergman is a man who constantly fights for what he believes in, fighting to tell the important stories and using the broader audience that CBS allows without giving in to the restrictions that come with working in such a large corporation. Taking on Wigand's testimony, Bergman is told for the first time that he's going to have to betray his word to a source and this doesn't sit well with him. There's an interesting parallel here again between what Bergman goes through and what Mann must face as well, working in the film industry. He is told to put his beliefs on hold, to sacrifice his word because CBS is too afraid of the consequences and in his riotous, dismayed reaction you have to wonder if Mann himself has ever given similar speeches when being told that he can't do something.Ultimately, Bergman and Wigand share a lot of things in common as human beings. They come from incredibly different worlds, Bergman being groomed on the streets and knowing the ins and outs of the industry, whereas Wigand is just a doctor from Louisville, Kentucky who is thrown in over his head with all of these large men with larger wallets. Despite their backgrounds though, they are both men who have their pride and their integrity and they are fighting for what they believe is right. They see these men of Big Tobacco lying on national television, lying in a court of law, and they know that it isn't right. They fight to get their story out, to expose the truth and force these men to face the consequences and it's a story that Michael Mann knows was important to get out to the film-viewing public. He does it with great stride, creating a film that is not only human and important, but also a fully engaging and tense thriller. I'm a large fan of Mann's work as a director throughout his career, but there is no doubt in my mind that this is his true masterpiece.",

Michael Mann's long \"The Insider\" is really about tobacco company \"whistle-blower\" Russell Crowe (as Jeffery Wigand), who brings the real dirt about the drug-peddling tobacco industry to the attention of \"60 Minutes\" producer Al Pacino (as Lowell Bergman). Christopher Plummer is an entertaining Mike Wallace. Looking older and fatter, Mr. Crowe has \"great actor\" written all over him. There is a marvelous scene with wicked cigarette C.E.O. Michael Gambon. Diane Venora does well in an underdeveloped role as Crowe's selfish wife. Interesting to see one of Crowe's daughters portrayed as asthmatic; it might have been more dramatic if, for contrast, Mr. Pacino's sons were seen buying a pack of cigarettes. The film is nicely produced, except for some unsteady camera-work during dramatic peaks.****** The Insider (10/28/99) Michael Mann ~ Russell Crowe, Al Pacino, Christopher Plummer, Michael Gambon",

The emotional intensity of the film makes you actually wonder what is going to happen next.Michael Mann is one of the few directors who knows what to do in a movie, and he clearly shows it in this movie. This movie rightfully deserves its 7 Oscar nominations and it should have won some.In short words, go see this film.",

Michael Mann uses magnificently his trademark action film aesthetics to bring this deep humane crime drama on to the screen. Stylish editing, novel camera movements and slow-motion don't draw any attention from the story, but it enhances the fear that the characters are going through. The visual style adds just another layer of intensity to already a suspenseful story and wonderful acting works.

Aired on 60 Minutes in 1994 with Al Pacino as a journalist unable to protect the one person with information. Russell Crowe is fired from his job when the incident becomes public, but Pacino wishes to break the story wide open despite negative reactions from co-workers. Apparently the story cannot be aired because it tells the truth. Tremendous film directed by Michael Mann who previously made The Last of the Mohicans. Crowe brings integrity as a man who stands by truth yet possibly gambling a big loss and severe consequences in the process. Pacino is commanding as a journalist out to expose the tobacco industry yet stands by the truth even at the cost of his own job. Diane Venora plays Crowe's frustrated wife who leaves him and thus becomes more or less expendable to the movie. Christopher Plummer steals scenes as another journalist doing daring interviews and agreeing to one with Crowe. Philip Baker Hall plays Dan Hewitt, creator and producer behind 60 Minutes. Insightful film about overcoming corruption despite the odds. Score: 10 / 10",

            "content": "There's hardly a flaw in this true account of the 60 Minutes expose of a tobacco industry cover-up.Al Pacino is brilliant as Lowell Bergman, the 60 Minutes producer who struggles to convince former tobacco executive Jeffrey Wigand (equally brilliantly played by Russell Crowe) to grant an interview in the face of the industry's attempts to silence him, and then has to fight CBS management to put the interview on the air. This is just a marvelous film.From the beginning scenes of the setting up of an interview between Mike Wallace (played by Christopher Plummer, who does a valiant job in a difficult role, playing someone as well known as Wallace) and an Arab sheik involved with the Hezbollah movement we get a sense of the point to come: that dealing with Middle East terrorists is a lot safer than taking on the tobacco industry! We're also hit right off the top by the irony underlying everything. Wigand, who worked as a senior executive for a tobacco company, is a health care specialist with a seriously asthmatic daughter.The first part of the movie plays like a spy thriller, as it focuses on the threats made against Wigand and family to silence him, and the pressure this puts on his family life as we literally see the man begin to crumble under the pressure. The focus of the second half shifts to Bergman's desperate attempts to get Wigand's interview broadcast after everything he has risked to blow the whistle. The battle between Bergman and CBS, also under pressure from the industry not to air the story, and vulnerable due to the network's impending sale, is well portrayed.This movie is absolutely worth the watching. It is vaguely ominous as we're confronted by the power not just of the tobacco industry, but of big business in general. Definitely a 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "It's interesting that, on several occasions, \"The Insider\" insists on the fact that it was a dramatization and at times fictionalization of real-life events as if the makers decided to adopt the characters' honesty and transparency. It's all to the credit of Eric Roth and Michael Mann who respectively wrote and directed a powerful drama about men caught in professional and ethical dilemmas, but ultimately, making the right choice. Still, this is a long road to these 'right choices', paved with seemingly insurmountable obstacles -the worst being internal- and depicted through a claustrophobic and moody thriller.For the thrills, \"The Insider\" relies on a heavy editing, an abundance of phone calls between angry protagonists, a succession of threats and volte-faces, of confused hesitations and divisive decisions, the overall effect is dizzying and upsetting, there are many reliefs where the characters can question their choices but it's only at the end that we can finally breath. And as inspirational as the message is, we're also glad that this exhaustive journey has finally ended. There's no cheers, no arms raised, no champagne popping, no exchange of smiles, there's a feeling of sheer loneliness that inhabit all the players of this influence-wrestling game between tobacco companies and the fourth estate as if one couldn't lead a collective crusade without condemning himself to an individual exile.It doesn't work for every movie but in the case of \"The Insider\", Michael Mann managed to inject a sense of existentialism in this quest for truth, that's not a matter of opinion that what the tobacco company did was wrong on every level, and even a smoker wouldn't deny it, but how about having the courage to denounce it? That's the whole point of whistle blowing, and the ungrateful burden rests on the shoulders on chemist Dr. Jeffrey Wygand (Russel Crowe), who meets CBS producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) after he's just lost his job. The meeting is purely coincidental but once Bergman understands that Wygand is under a contract of confidentiality, his instinct tells him that something doesn't smell good about the tobacco industry, and it's not just tobacco.Wygand is a man of probity, and never is this certitude shaken to pretend to mislead us, even when the adverse parties try to sabotage his image. What the film shows though is that he's a man of responsibility. If he speaks, he loses all his severance benefits and will be sued, not to mention the psychological effect of death threats and the growing discouragement of his wife (Renee Olstead). The marital element is crucial because there's no attempt of understanding what her husband is going through, all she sees is that they will lose the house, the ones where their daughters made their first steps, their privileges, their comfort, everything they built. From the moment, Wygand embarks in this battle, it's like an earthquake menacing the foundations of their marriage, and it's a matter of time before the inevitable. The tragedy is also on a private level.And Russell Crowe plays Wygand in such a way that we can relate to him, a man who's caught in a worse fight than one on the battlefield because it's permanent and affects his life on a daily basis. Take the trigger of his decision to accept the interview with CBS, only when he's threatened in a patronizing way by his former bosses, he accepts CBS' deal. His ego is tickled, he makes the right choice for the wrong reasons, but it's still right in the sense that it will then throw the 'hot potato' to the journalist and confront them to their own ethical hypocrisy, when CBS is confronted to the legal intricacies that would force them to pay one hell of a bill if they ever interfere between a company and a worker. There comes a point where everyone must make a choice and pay the price.Mike Wallace, one of the most enduring and respected correspondents of the CBS \"60 Minutes\" program, played by Christopher Plummer, uses all available means and his power to get the interview done, he's a man who interviewed tyrants and politicians, but he can taste the sour irony when the \"seven dwarfs\" of the third major tobacco company are preventing him from doing his job and forcing him to surrender to the cause of money. While he does play in the same team than Bergman, he's powerless when the real threat comes from \"inside\", quite fitting, given the film's title. Publishing the interview might ruin the channel's deal with Westinghouse, which represents a great opportunity of financial expansion. And now, the journalists are entrapped in the same dilemma. Bergman couldn't understand Wygand, until the end.The merit of \"The Insider\" is to highlight the truth that there's not one courageous step that doesn't have a price.And while the film is driven by the whole chronicles of fact and investigation procedures, it really gets into an unexpected level of poignancy when the main players are confronted to their failures, ignoring that they are temporary. When Wygand learns that the airing is canceled, his reaction is pleasantly surprising, by that time, he's divorced and he's alone, but what he deplores is that his daughters will never know why their lives had taken such a dramatic change, to realize that it was worth it. And Wallace has a powerful exchange with Bergman, aware that infamy lasts longer than glory, and that this failure might ruin his legacy, because what he did was betraying the legacy of Edward Murrow, and since I recently saw \"Good Night, and Good Luck\", I could appreciate the comparison.Truth ultimately triumphed and yes, it was all worth it, but it was an omelet that broke many eggs, and many spirits, but it's a triumph nonetheless and Wygand, Bergman and Wallaces' legacies wouldn't suffer from it\u0085 otherwise, there wouldn't be a movie like \"The Insider\".",

            "content": "At the beginning of this year something was seriously wrong with the majority of reviewers in the world. For some strange and obscure reason they all gave top marks to junk like this, American Beauty and Being John Malkovich. Although I understand why they did this for the latter there is no excuse and no denying that The Insider is quite possibly the most over-rated and over-hyped film ever that was unfortunate enough to be seen only by totally biased audience. Except me of course. The story is about Jeff Wigand, who is fired from his job at a tobacco company and wants to do an interview with 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman. At first he does not want to do it but thanks to pressure increasingly mounted on him he decides to do it out of spite and retaliation it seems. You see the tobacco companies do not want Wigand to let the whole world know that cigarettes are addictive. But everyone knows that anyway so what's the big deal? It's hardly big screen material. It may make an 85-minute long TV movie but it certainly cannot stretch over 2 and a half hours even with the talents of Al Pacino and Russell Crowe to support it.Let me just say that Heat was cool. Long, but still a very good film. I do admit that Michael Mann is a good director, but every director coughs up a severe dud once in a while. For Steven Spielberg there was Amistad and for Kubrick there was Eyes Wide Shut. Both of these films received excellent reviews for one reason only: the reputation of the director. This is why so many people lied to themselves that The Insider is a good film (snigger). No way! Out of sheer respect to Michael Mann the whole world has given false review of this film but I'm about to give you the truth. The rest of mankind has been so brainwashed that The Insider is Oscar-worthy so they might try to hurt me for telling you this, but because I'm such a humanitarian I'm willing to risk it. THE INSIDER IS GARBAGE! There I said it.A Shocking amount of characters appear for a few seconds or maybe even longer and then disappear for the whole movie without them even being introduced to us or at least telling us their purpose to the story. This makes a series of confusing and drama-free events even more blurred and low in any kind of narrative. Mann also goes as far to not even give us reasons for events taking place. Like those men in black suits who just enter Jeff Wigand's (Russell Crowe) home and take his hard drive. Who were they? Who sent them? Why didn't Wigand do anything about it? Like call the police or even tell Bergman (Pacino). This scene is embarrassing to watch because Wigand is such a wimp. He does nothing! If someone came into my home I wouldn't just let them take my computer without doing anything.The only thing that is decent in this travesty is Dante Spinoti's widescreen photography, which is stunning. The scene with Bergman knee-deep in the ocean is a great example of wonderful cinematography. But that isn't enough. Sadly The Insider is as bloated as it is self-important and boring as it is confusing. A huge big mess. At the end you feel so bum-numbed and exhilarated that you just want to lie down. Maybe some people confused this sensation as the result of seeing a good movie. Which it certainly is NOT! Beware! 1/10.Shawn Watson",

            "review_title": "Poor one-sided melodrama - much heat, little light",
            "content": "Caution: Contains spoilersI disliked this movie. Generally, I found it boring - and yet somehow also confusing (e.g., the absence of any warning, for example, when Pacino would suddenly be reviewing tape or showing up somewhere - and you are trying hard to understand how this fits into the Wigand story - and it doesn't - it's another story Pacino's working on altogether!).One of the primary problems with the movie is that it is the gospel according to one tendentious self-righteous character - one who cares nothing at all for confidentiality provisions. I suppose this is a journalistic flaw generaly - to feel that some agreements are critical (e.g., an agreement with a source) and others are entirely worthles (e.g., a confidentiality provision in an agreement with a government or in this case, corporate employee). Why this should be so is unexplained.Thus we hear Pacino's character rant about sources distrusting him in the future because the source's story was excised from a broadcast - we don't hear a word from Crowe's character about whether any employer will ever again trust him after he's agreed to take unearned compensation and free health insurance in a severance agreement in exchange for his confidentiality - and proceeds to betray the corporation's trust.So, for what critical news does the movie see the confidentiality provision as valueless? That cigarettes are referred to at one of the tobacco companies as a \"nicotine delivery system\" and that the company continued to use an ammonia-based additive that more quickly delivers the rush to the nervous system and bloodstream (for which people buy cigarettes) even while Crowe's character was working on a replacement. That's it! From this, Crowe's character grandly gives HIS view of Brown & Williamson's CEO's mental state as deceitful when that man testified that cigarettes were not addictive because nicotine was not a drug. Wow! This is news? YOu mean, they WEREN'T telling the truth? You mean cigarettes AREN'T EASY to stop smoking? I clearly recall the day after the CEOs gave that testimony before Congress that it produced nationwide ridicule - editorials in all the major newspapers, sarcastic commentary by magazines. The nation freely mocked the obvious lies.And for THIS, CBS must induce Crowe's character to violate his freely-agreed upon confidentiality provision - a provision for which he was handsomely paid (he says) and that took care of all the health needs of his children? I truly don't get it!Moreover, the movie is confusing in failing to properly emphasize the plot points. They only glancingly mention that the original broadcast is aired AFTER Wigand's testimony before a Mississippi trial is spread in newspapers around the country. The movie had already told us that his deposition testimnony in that case was \"under seal\".  So what happened? This is the movie's turning point- now it is no longer confidential - so CBS is free to broadcast Wigand's story - there is no danger any more of a judgment (properly) entered against CBS. How was the order committing the testimony under seal changed? Did the judge reverse himself? Did an appellate court overturn it? We never know.Instead, the movie emphasizes the telling of the inside story of the excision of Wigand's testimony to the NY Times - why would that change any of the minds of the CBS corporate heads or counsel? They didnt' seem to care that Wallace led off the original broadcast with his disagreement with CBS' decision - so why would they care now? The movie doesn't make it clear.What HAS changed is the viability of a suit against CBS - originally it was likely - now the information is no longer confidential so CBS is free to run Wigand's interview. Yet the movie somehow treats this as incidental - BECAUSE the movie doesn't take seriously the threat of suit, the likelihood of judgment and dismisses the entire notion of confidentiality agreements (at one point referring to suits for tortious interference with such agreements as \"something that sounds like bad radio reception\").\nLudicrously, the movie (in a very conspiratorial tone) tries to make something of the fact that CBS executives would fail to gain from a pending merger of CBS and Westinghouse due to such a lawsuit - AHA! That's why they're squelching the story. The move fails to follow through on its reasoning. Why would they fail to gain? Becuase of the perception that such a suit would be successful - as successful as the Mississippi lawyers' suits against tobacco! And both for good reason - because contracts are respected by law - not only in the U.S. but in every country on earth. The movie doesn't care.The worst scene is during the deposition of Crowe in the Mississippi case - when a tobacco lawyer properly objects to testimony that appears to invade the confidentiality of his client's commercial information - and in fact to induce breach of a specific agreement by the witness (Crowe) - against whom a court in Kentucky has already weighed the likelihood of success in a suit and issued a restraining order against Crowe's testimony. In response, the anti-tobacco lawyer hysterically screams at the anti-tobacco lawyer that they are in Mississippi rather than Kentucky - and then absurdly yells he should \"take that smirk off his face\". The movie then shows the little villain cowed - the smirk disappears. Snidely Whiplash is defeated.\nThis is a truly poor movie. It's a movie that fails to have a single person defend such agreements in general or in this particular - instead it creates strawmen who give personal reasons for not running the story (\"I'm too old to buck the system\" or \"I unhesitatingly obey authority and this is what they say\" or \"I am nothing without CBS\"). How about \"this is not very newsworthy and we may be doing something very wrong, because I respect such freely negotiated agreements?\" NOpe.The movie is agit-prop - often illogical. I was truly disappointed - I expected a LOT better.",

I never thought a movie that deals with the issue of cigarettes would turn out to be such a fascinating film, but as usual I was wrong. Not only was this film wonderfully acted, it had a steady pace, a well-written script, and wonderful directing by Michael Mann.Michael Mann's film is about a tobacco industry whistleblower named Jeffrey Wigand who got fired from his job and he decides to testify against the company thanks to the efforts of Lowell Bergmann and his 60 Minutes crew and the American legal system. However the careers of Wigand and Bergmann might be on the line if this goes out to the public.Al Pacino and Russell Crowe are two very talented actors that have blessed us with their screen talent over the years. Pacino seems to have gotten better with age and he showcases great acting in the film. Russell Crowe has a memorable performance as Wigand. He does a good job playing the shy, not-wanting-to-talk type of people.Overall, they have found away to make corporate dramas interesting as proved here. This could have easily been a dry, boring movie but the subtle directing by Mann makes this a thriller that will keep your mind and heart racing. However, I want to mention that although this is based off a true story, there are some changes made for dramatical purposes.

Instead of plot or character development we are subjected to endless meandering sequences, often accompanied by soporific 'wailing woman' music. Much of it looks like a pop video and not a very good one. Then blam, a sudden melodramatic scene with Pacino and Crowe shouting at each other. The film is about 3 hours but seems MUCH longer. Anyone making such a film about a similar subject in 1950 would have made it in 90 minutes tops and the film would have been tighter and better for it.As it is, the film vacillates between this ambling (and very undramatic) style with scenes of manufactured conflict. There is nothing in between. Clearly the director was keen to make a 'great' and 'important' film, but Michael Mann is no Kubrik and cannot sustain his rambling camera-work. The final scene with Pacino walking out the door of CBS, summed up the pretentious ambitions of the film. Pointlessly subjected to slowing down and speeding up it was the final piece of self indulgence in a highly indulgent film.The inherently interesting subject matter attracted a large cast of fine actors. Pacino is always watchable and Plummer puts in a good turn. Crowe is competent if uninspiring in his role. The script, like everything could have done with a good deal of editing. There is also a lazy reference to @all the presidents' men' near the end, a much tauter and better film.",

            "content": "Not since 1976's \"All the President's Men\" has a film shown how vital, dangerous and deeply conflicted the field of journalism is, and \"The Insider\" goes there and beyond. It's not just about professional and legal conflicts, but also issues of trust and dignity that have deep personal repercussions. Michael Mann (\"Heat\") delivers yet another film that goes beyond its subject (journalism), beyond merely a plot with intriguing conflict and into a realm with ethical considerations for everyone.\"The Insider\" delves into issues of confidentiality and where journalism's first allegiance is by telling the story of how former \"60 Minutes\" producer Lowell Bergman (Pacino) convinced a top researcher for a Big Tobacco company, Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe), to come on camera with information implicating the industry for knowingly enhancing the addictiveness of the nicotine in its products. But Mann isn't as interested in the logistics of the legal processes and whatnot as he is the personal implications for Wigand, Bergman and CBS. Issues of trust and moral responsibility abound. Wigand and Bergman develop a relationship both with the most honorable intentions in our eyes -- Bergman wants the truth and Wigand wants to risk his financial well-being to enlighten the public, but Wigand's paranoia and the responses by Big Tobacco lawyers create a shaky dynamic between the two. The cast is loaded with incredible talent (Christopher Plummer, Philip Baker Hall, Rip Torn, etc.) but Pacino and Crowe are the most necessary to mention. Pacino brings his same machismo: he sounds as if he knows exactly what he's talking about -- his reactions when his character comes under fire are calculated and not overplayed, even when he does his signature shouting. As for Crowe, his character's emotional issues are apparent and his execution of this is vital at taking us beyond the issue at hand and having great sympathy for his conundrum: to tell the truth he risks his family and his livelihood. His performance, in addition with that in \"L.A. Confidential\" is all the proof necessary that this guy can act.Mann and \"Forrest Gump\" writer Eric Roth deliver a script that while certainly busy with many characters that are hard to discern at times, perfectly gets across exactly what needs to be said as succinctly as possible to both move plot and provoke thought. It's very easy to stay with this film despite needing to move quickly to fit everything into 155 minutes.Especially journalists, but everyone who has daily ethical concerns with their job, can also appreciate the fairness with which the film handles both sides of the debate. Basically, CBS makes a critical decision on whether to air the interview and both sides make convincing arguments. The best part is that what's unquestionably, morally right wins out in this film despite it's very psychologically damaging consequences on its main characters. As Mann points out, where the truth is concerned, it's not all about who wins, but it's the principle on which you got there.\"The Insider\" is thought-provoking and insightful, a true example of how one specialized area like investigative journalism and confidentiality law suits can become universally understood through great dramatic writing and the write talent executing it.",

One a Newsman, Pachino. The other a scientist, Crowe.If the satirical lunacy of \"Thank You For Smoking\" could be akin to the easy goings of Gerber Baby sauce, then this indigestion in the form of a laxative.Mann's uncanny and infamous eye for precision and uncompromising realism is a marvel of stylish substance in itself. Almost like it's own thematic element regardless of what it's attempting to illustrate or accompany as a motif.Unfortunately, I had been preprogrammed by his former films; \"Heat,\"0 \"Collateral\" and the often overlooked, \"Miami Vice,\" to expect some sort of climactic hell-storm of machine gunfire. At first, I was actually--prematurely, at that--deeming this destined to be a stop-gap film in Mann's career. By mid-way, the sentiment of how wrong I had been was becoming more than embarrassingly palpable with each furthered development in the plot. The film could have ended several times. It could have inferred several completely differing resolutions. It proceeds despite itself to formulate it's plot out of significant character's arcs and roles, rather than playing to simply Crowe's predicament. Mann's narrative and subject matter is so layered and sparse with an unrecognizable plot at first glance, it could have properly faired well as a mini-series, similar to that of \"State of Play.\"",

A perfect movie'. Michael Mann's The Insider is such a movie. I held off on reviewing it for a couple days after seeing it, partly to let it sink in but mostly to see if I'd feel any different about it once my synapses had cooled down and the frames had dimmed from my consciousness. Perhaps the fiery reaction it drew from me in the moment was cheaply earned, or I was just in the right mood to love it at that time. Not a chance. If anything I've become more enraptured by it as time has passed, already aching for a second viewing. Every performance and aspect of is just so rich, deep and rewarding that for its two and a half hour runtime I found myself externally distracted not once. Occasionally Mann deviates from his comfort zone in the nocturnal crime zone. The occult themed period piece, the colonial adventure, the psychological horror, and this, the blistering drama based on a true story. One might not think the subject matter deserves a two and a half hour film, let alone would make a great one, but Mann has the cinematic Midas touch, and never half asses it. His work always contains traces of a true master at work, telling little details that engrave the film with a sense of immaculate skill and unwavering dedication to telling the story in its finest, and most honest form. The Insider tells the story of Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), a chemist who turns whistleblower on the tobacco corporation he was once employed by, finding shelter under the wing of CBS News's 60 minutes, and particularly hard nosed reporter Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino). The network wants his take, in order to do an expos\u00e9 on Big Tobacco, a plan with predictably disastrous and dangerous results, for both Wigand and CBS. The film shakes off any impending sensationalism or deliberately emotional stylistic cheats, instead keeping a microscope focus on the three lead performances and letting all the hurt, determination and emotion come forth naturally through their work, as opposed to smothering their story with an overbearing score and cheap cinematic manipulation. I've never been that won over by Russell Crowe until now. He always seems 'halfway there' in his work, like he's missing something. This changed things for me. He's like a raw nerve here, a family man pushed to the precipice of an impossible decision. One can almost see him wrestling with his conscience behind those haunted eyes, a storm with a lid barely kept on and anchored by Crowe in his finest hour. Pacino holds us captive with his work until we realize we're not breathing. He's the moral compass of the piece, and to see him explode at the injustices served up to him will give you goosebumps. The third leg of the table is Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace, the 60 minutes anchor who also struggles morally with the situation they are in. Plummer is so good you forget you're watching a film, giving Wallace buried gentleness and chiselled emotional intensity that you can scarce believe is even possible through acting. The supporting cast is peppered with bushels of talent. Colm Feore, Philip Baker Hall, Gina Gershon, Stephen Tobolowsky, Diane Venora, Nester Serrano, Rip Torn, Michael Gambon and an unusually sedated Debi Mazar are superb. It's Bruce McGill, however, who almost steals the film in one blistering scene, playing a lawyer with enough righteous anger to shatter your TV screen. A career best for him. No one puts you into a story by forcing you to feel alongside the characters quite like Mann. Here he guides through the trials that Crowe, Plummer and Pacino face with steady hand and heart until we are invested. Then he pulls the ripcord and let's the sparks fly, making monumentally intense work of events that could seem pedestrian in lesser hands. We really feel for Crowe and clutch the seat with the same desperate intensity that he clings to his family, and sanity. We feel the same jilted fury alongside Pacino as he wades through sickening bureaucracy for a shot at retribution. We take pause with Plummer as he ponders his legacy and are incredulous with all three at the snowball effect the entire proceeding has had on them, devastating us as an audience the same as them, in turn making us feel closer to them. This is all laced with the incredibly heartfelt music from Lisa Gerrard, who sang alongside Crowe in Gladiator and was a favourite of Tony Scott as well. Mann is a ceaseless monster of storytelling, tone and pacing. The story has flair simply because he doesn't wantonly throw it in the mix; the feeling and reaction come from story and character and not the razzle dazzle. Mann knows this, and let's the fireworks naturally spring from the absence of deliberation, like music in the vacuum of space. This one will live on to stand the test of time far longer than the decade and a half its help for already. It's a revelation.",

Get A-list actors, directors, and some decent, serious plot for a film, and you'll get those academy award nominations rolling in.  But great actors don't make a great film.  Story is always, and has always been, number one.I thought this film gives us a slick pacing in its storyline, which is good. But it is emotionally flat throughout the picture.  The biggest problem is the theme itself.  I don't know about the others who thinks this film is a roller-coaster thriller, but almost everyone now knows that smoking is bad for the health.  I felt like I already knew half of the story before I actually walk in to the theatre.I am biased when I saw this movie, I admit.  My bias is that I kept thinking about we all already know of the movie's premise ... about the scumbucket tobacco industry.  We all know about the effect of tobacco on our lungs. Still, I was hoping that the film would provide some plot-twists out of an ordinary story.  But noooo .... it has to be about a depressed scientist who spends his time just trying to get away from the bad guys, just because he is going to tell the world that tobacco kills. That's all there is to it. True story?  Yawn.  Al Pacino also looks like he needs to drink some coffee and freshen up - he looked so tired and uninteresting here.  Heck, I never thought I would get tired of seeing Al Pacino, but for the first time I did.This movie, being a true story, showed a lot of promise, but unfortunately ended up being just too straight and simple for my tastes.  What is scary in real life doesn't mean that it's scary onscreen (and vice versa).  I blame it on the director.

I may have seen either of them before in other movies, but I don't recall watching either one of them previously on screen. It was coming on TV today and I knew that they starred in it and I watched it.Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) is a TV producer of '60 minutes' on CBS which is an explosive show revealing the darker side of society. Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) is a corporate Vice-President and Head of research & development in Brown & Williams Tobacco Company (or something). He is fired from his job as he was having a moral conflict with himself over the substances put into the tobaccos and the company felt threatened by him. They made him sign a legal confidentiality report and threatened his family. But, he wanted the truth to be told, that their tobacco was basically a drug. Thousands of lawsuits were brushed off every year by the company and he wanted the company to pay for their sins. Lowell Bergman contacts Jeffrey and they, with Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) as the interviewer, record Jeffrey's allegations on tape. But, due to the fact that the tobacco company could file a defamation lawsuit worth billions of dollars, CBS decides to cut out Jeffrey's interviews. In the end, Lowell gets his way and the company ends up owing $250 billion to America.The opening scene with Lowell and Mike Wallace in Iraq establishes them as true news presenters who fight for the truth and justice. They do their work with passion and are very good at what they do. The film also gives a lot of screen time on Jeffrey's family and his wife's inner turmoil on whether she could support her husband or not, in those dangerous times. Jeffrey is 'The Insider' who has lots of information about the company's illegal ways. Though the edge of the sword was always dangling above Jeffrey's neck, the villains were never shown, except in a couple of scenes and they weren't the routine big goons, as basically the tobacco company itself was the villain. Russell Crowe impressed me a lot and all of the actors did a wonderful job in portraying this real life story. But, I don't think I become a Al Pacino or Russell Crowe fan by watching this. This isn't completely a thriller, but also drama. It was perfectly directed by Michael Mann and as I didn't know how the ending went, I enjoyed it very much.8/10",

At one time, doctor Frederick Treves (Hopkins) rescues him and takes him with him to his Hospital. There he gets very well treated, despite several incidental occurrences, now that he bumps into a whole new experience, being exposed to the society, not as an animal but as a sick person. Brilliant how Lynch empowers one's humanity and personality from his physical semblance, always keeping our stupid practise to despise and dehumanize the abnormal alive reaching a stunning level of contrast. Never seen one like it. This movie is both emotional and medically great. Notice that even Dr Treves starts to use Merrick as an awesome target for enhancing his reputation around medical community, until he notices his great intellectual capabilities. The Elephant Man also very elucidative of Lynch's career. The whole movie portrays how Human life roams around fear and how it explains both lacking and excess of power, as strategy of defense or submission to avoid pain. 9/10",

            "content": "Fired from his vice-president research job with a large tobacco firm, Jeffrey Wigand accepts a temporary consultation role for Sixty Minutes producer Lowell Bergman. During this comparatively straightforward role, Wigand catches Bergman's interest by clearly stressing what he can discuss and not discuss. From this casual comment, Bergman starts asking and learns of Wigand's opinion that the CEO of his former employer perjured himself because the firm is very much aware of the addictive effect of their product. When Wigand decides to move forward with Sixty Minutes and act as a whistleblower, pressure is very quickly brought to bear on him, his family and all the companies involved in the story.There appears to be little debate on this site as to whether or not this film is long and slow \u0096 it almost certainly is both. However where there is a lack of consensus is over the question of whether this is a problem or not. So we get comments saying how engaging it all is contrasted with those bemoaning it for its length and how boring it all was. I cannot say who is right or wrong, all I can do is add my opinion to theirs and say that to me there was the risk of this being quite hard work and I think it is credit to those involved that it is not. I was surprised by the fact that I still had not gotten round to seeing this film almost a decade after it was made, but in my defence the subject does make it sound like it will be dry as sand and as exciting as ironing. Still, given the stuff I do watch it is a real oversight on my part not to have seen such a high profile film.Watching it for the first time is to be impressed. As someone else has said, most people will know how it ends but yet the film still manages to grip the viewer. The story itself is fascinating not only in regards what happens but also its wider meaning. The script allows the viewer to understand the commercial forces on the tobacco companies but also on the news firms and this helps to make the film more interesting than just the very specific story of Wigand. However the central story itself is still interesting and it does fill the time with a steady (albeit slow) pace throughout. The liberal bias inherent in the telling is a little off-putting as the film seems to be aiming a bit too squarely for corporations and those making the money rather than just letting the audience draw their own conclusions. That aside though it is still a quality piece of work across the board.Mann's direction draws out strong performances and also puts the audience into the action even when, technically, there isn't any. He is greatly helped by cinematographer Spinotti, who delivers corporate blues and greys as well as alternating between a static camera in some scenes and a unsteady handcam that matches the increasing stress and strain being put on Wigand. The lead two are both excellent. Pacino of course chews the scenery but he does so in a way that is comparatively restrained to when he is particularly hammy \u0096 here he is just right, a strong presence but not to the point of being detrimental. Crowe is just as impressive but provides a very subtle performance that has the material but lacks the flamboyance of Pacino's performance while being just as good. Support is solid with turns from Hall, Plummer, Gambon, Gershon, Torn, Tobolowsky and Venora and the cast doesn't really have a weak spot.It is long, it has very little in the way of \"action\" for those looking for explosions and such and the political slant on the telling is very much to the Left, but yet it is engaging and professionally done. The cast are impressive at best and strong at worst while Mann and Spinotti have produced a film that is beautifully crafted and uses the camera to engage the audience as well as the performances and story. Don't follow my procrastinating example and seek this film out soon.",

Equally interesting is the CBS \"60 Minutes\" episode where they lost their nerve and pulled an interview they had taped rather than face a lawsuit. It's a classic battle between their legal office and the news people, reminding one of the later film \"Good Night and Good Luck\" about Edward R. Murrow, whose spirit and legacy aren't easy to live up to. Tying it together is the nice characterizations and sharp writing, making this movie, if not a thriller, than very close to it. Russel Crowe and Al Pacino are at the forefront, but Christopher Plummer is right up there, playing CBS' Mike Wallace. The movie ingeniously ties together the tobacco story, a very good drama about the power of corporate giants. You keep waiting for the violence to start, but it stays concealed under a tight, well coordinated effort to destroy the whistle-blower, the character assassination that's more effective and damaging than the use of physical violence. The deposition scene in a Mississippi office is one of the best dramatized legal showdowns in a long time. Mississippi, like so many other states, was faced with the costs of caring for all those sick smokers and was at the forefront of going after the big companies to seek reimbursement. How a movie can make a technical legal battle so interesting is a tribute to director Michael Mann and this, perhaps his best film so far.

The movie tells the true story of Jeffrey Wigand (played by Russell Crowe in an Oscar nominated performance)who used to work as a tobacco scientist who ended up getting fired and whistle-blowing what has been going with his former workplace to \"60 Minutes\" news anchor Mike Wallace (played by Christopher Plummer)amid receiving death threats along with his family and trying to get protected by the producer of \"60 Minutes\" named Lowell Bergman (played by Al Pacino). this was the first film that Pacino did for Mann after working on Heat (1995) four years earlier, everything about this film is just flawless especially when it comes to the amazingly good performances from Al Pacino, Russell Crowe,Christopher Plummer, Philip Baker Hall, and Diane Venora as Jeffrey's wife (later ex-wife). Mann's and Eric Roth's script, along with Mann's directorship and Dante Spinotti's photography are just excellent, and as a result the movie got 7 Oscar nominations including Best Picture , Best Actor for Russell Crowe, and Best Director for Michael Mann. Which are few reasons why I think that it is a great film as well as the emotional range of the Russell Crowe performance which made me empathize with what he was going through throughout the course of the entire film.",

            "content": "Russell Crowe plays Dr. Jeffrey Wigand, an intelligent yet difficult and imperfect (i.e. normal!) man who decides to go public although he is extremely publicity shy. For this performance the movie can be highly recommended. It reminded me of some of Rod Steiger's best acting feats. Dr. Jeffrey Wigand is mad, and his anger is somehow related to moral issues. In venting his anger publicly Wigand thinks he can reduce his inner pressure and cherish hopes that he may have a future life in peace with himself and with the world. The presentation of this character was very credible. It enables you to take Dr. Jeffrey Wigand at face value.A possibility to get release materializes for Wigand like a miracle in the form of Lowell Bergman, played by Al Pacino. Bergman is the producer of a TV show - the very instance of truth and honesty. Bergman is zapping through the real world. Today Beyruth, tomorrow the backwoods of Montana (the UNA-bomber, you know!), and in between Kentucky, where Wigand lives. Why is Wigand interesting for Bergman? Well, the guy worked for the tobacco industry and has to tell something! Tobacco related stuff promises the station high ratings. So the moral issue gets married with commerce.Pacino's character is one of those media-man sterotypes that annoy me since The Killing Fields. The mixture of arrogance, moral suprematism, pretentiousness and sham soul baring is really sickening. This feeling is augmentated by the all too smug suburban patchwork breakfast-cereal-commercial-family life as depicted in this movie. What's more, Pacino at all time looks as if he is just dying for a fag.After watching this movie you will know that smoking cigarettes can endanger your health. That's not really news, is it? Moreover, you will gain the impression that the big business tobacco industry is no better than a criminal organisation. Purportedly, the story of The Insider is based on actual facts. And yet I wonder how much of it is true. Putting a \"gag\" into Wigand's mouth seems for the tobacco industry like shooting in one's own foot. And the media's getting at the tobacco industry looks like the shooting of an already badly wounded animal. I know, I could be totally wrong about those issues, but the movie is made in a way that in the end you feel almost sorry for the poor tobacco guys who just want to earn an honest buck.There is in this movie a consistent muddling up of motives, causes and effects for the sake of dramatization and a message which seems to be made for simpletons. In my opinion this is bad when real moral issues are at the core of the whole thing like here.",

            "content": "You wouldn't think a film about a corporate whistleblower could be as exciting as this one, but Michael Mann did a superb job of keeping this viewer on the edge of his seat for two and a half hours.  He doesn't make many films - this one came out four years after his previous one, \"Heat\" (also excellent) - but the director makes the most of his shots.First of all, the acting is superb.  Russell Crowe is as good in his portrayal of the scientist who blows the tobacco industry's dirty little secret as he was playing Maximus in \"Gladiator\" - he was nominated for an Oscar as best leading actor (Mann was nominated for director also).  Neither of them won, nor did anyone else associated with this film, so maybe the tobacco thugs were getting the final word after all.Crowe handles this difficult part extremely well.  Dr. Wigand is a man tortured with inner doubts.  Does he do what he knows is right, expose the tobacco industry for peddling an addictive drug under the guise of an innocent agricultural product, or does he knuckle under to corporate pressure to keep quiet?  Complicating his life is a wife who doesn't want to take risks, who resents their lowered economic status, and who eventually deserts him when he needs all the moral support he can get.  Cameron Crowe reveals all these inner conflicts in a most believable way and makes his character a hero without the usual props.Al Pacino plays the \"60 Minutes\" producer, Lowell Bergman, in his usual fine manner.  He's a bit of a crusader, and the film takes some liberties in the truth to build up his character, but he comes off well without being too overbearing.  Christopher Plummer is also excellent as Mike Wallace.  And the rest of the cast is very good too.  But it's a tribute to Crowe's acting skills that he was able to outshine Pacino in a movie that was made for him.And the best part of this film is that it is, except for some dramatic enhancements, true.  Dr. Wigand's testimony was the start of tearing apart the veneer of invulnerability the tobacco industry had managed to create for itself.  Since that \"60 Minutes\" piece, these huge corporations have been forced to pay out enormous sums to litigants harmed by their products, and that is really a sweet thing.",

Their crusade is fascinating to watch, and you'll find yourself totally engaged in the story.

            "content": "Michael Mann follows his superb Heat with an excellent if more cerebral drama. Firstly, the script by Eric Roth and Mann brilliantly distills a complex story into narrative that is suspenseful, emotionally effective yet highly thoughtful and sophisticated. It certainly has a lot to say about the shady worlds of US corporate, legal and media culture. Despite this complexity the film zips along at a terrific pace, mainly due to the excellent script being supported by great direction and first rate acting by the whole cast, albeit special mention has to go to Pacino, Crowe and Plummer for truly outstanding performances. Certainly that fearsome intangible of powerful corporate forces working to destroy an individual's reputation comes across very strongly, and Russell Crowe's intense performance is key in selling this to the audience. It is also fascinating to see the situation that Pacino's Lowell Bergmann's character is put into by these corporate forces, and these two character's willingness to hold onto their integrity and beliefs is genuinely affecting despite the great personal cost it has on their characters, particularly Crowe's. Crowe's and Pacino's excellent portrayals are well complimented by Plummer veteran reporter/correspondent character, and the journey this character goes through while different, is nevertheless fascinating even if his character doesn't generate the same levels of sympathy for his plight \u2013 in fact it is his initial actions at a key point in the story that generate a great sense of disappointment in his character Mann orchestrates proceeding with bravado and panache, though not forgetting that this is a cerebral drama where ultimately it is the actors' performances that will lead to the success of the movie. However, Mann is a master of embedding slick film-making around excellent dramatic performances. Not only does he get the actors to shine, but he yet again draws excellent work from both the photography and editing teams, and huge credit has to go to editors William Goldenberg, David Rosenbloom and Paul Rubell, musicians Pieter Bourke, Lisa Gerrard and Graeme Revell, production designer Brian Morris and particularly Mann regular director of photography Dante Spinotti. It certainly deserved its 7 Academy Award nominations and in my view should have won several.Despite its lack of commercial success, this is a fantastic film, which tells of terrific story through excellent performances from its lead actors, who work in a visual environment that beautifully complements their performances, for which Michael Mann deserves huge credit.",

            "content": "Directed by Michael Mann, The Insider belonged to the category of movies with a number of nominations for an Academy Award, but won none. Based on a true story (of course with some dramatic license taken) involving the CBS hit television documentary series 60 Minutes, this is a rare insight into the time when the acclaimed series faltered in its editorial stand.WIth whistle-blowing having the local spotlight in recent months, no thanks to the NKF fiasco, this movie tells the tale of integrity in investigative journalism, and how two men rose to overcome personal challenges, to put out a story with damning evidence against the tobacco industry.Russell Crowe plays Dr Jeffrey Wigand, an R&D vice president at Brown & WIlliamson, recently fired for reasons unknown. As he holds an important role in the company, his severance package requires him, and I suppose like all leadership positions in Fortune 500 companies do, to sign a confidentiality agreement. However, he's holding onto something big that could damage the industry, and with these companies, having their reputations and industry survival put on the line, is never cowering to non-conformists.Herein lies the dilemma about moral obligation - if you're privy to industry information that is sensitive to the company, yet in the public's eye can help save lives, and put things into perspective, would you go public with the information? Wigand was undecided, but hearsay of horror stories, and being compelled to believe that he and his family were being watched, and threatened, he made up his mind that enough was enough, and did what a man would have done, even though it was against his wife's wishes, and didn't the guarantee safety of his family.Besides Wigand, the other protagonist is Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), who is a producer at the famed 60 Minutes. Fighting to get Wigand's story told, he too runs into opposition from all angles, including internal ones at CBS News. To survive, he had to rely on personal wit and contact to establish and swing things around in his favour, even resorting to giving unauthorized scoops into the inside happenings at 60 Minutes when they decided to air an abridged version of the story.The movie raises a number of interesting questions about the wheelings and dealings of the supposedly free press in the USA, and how when you're under media scrutiny, every little dirty detail you have hidden about your past, will be brought up and blown out of proportion. Grim reminder, but true.The acting by the two leads will keep you riveted as you watch the entire proceedings unfold, until Massive Attack's Safe From Harm (just the remixed instrumental) closes the curtain. Code 1 DVD contains the theatrical trailer, a 7min production making-of featurette where you'll see the real Lowell Bergman and Dr Jeffrey Wigand, and a relatively useless Inside A Scene segment where you'll see a partial notes to the actors, script, and the actual scene again, how it played out according to paper.",

A film about a heroic whistle-blower fighting against the evils of big tobacco: it sounds like a black and white story. And there are certain clich\u00e9s in this movie: the selfish wife, for example, who doesn't stand by her husband when he can no longer provide for her in the style to which she was accustomed (although I fear that in one scene, where she contemplates the awful possibility that she might have to go out to work, that the audience is actually being encouraged to sympathise with her). And yet the first two thirds of this movie is really strong. Mann gets his A-list cast to justify their salaries, none more so than Russel Crowe as the whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigland, who displays a character he doesn't often show: nerdy, insecure, un-self confident, torn between conscience and self-interest. Precisely because Wigland is not obviously a wonderful (or indeed a terrible) human being, but an ordinary man, the story is more interesting; and black-and-white or not, the story of such an individual fighting the huge power of corporate America is terrifying and brilliantly told. I was gripped; but the last third of the movie doesn't quite have the same power. Partly it's because we see the same story again, now within a news organisation thinking about broadcasting an interview with Wigland. But however passionately the journalists care about the story, it's hard to believe that this is their fight in quite the same way it's Wiglands, some themes are repetitive, and the idea that a news organisation should make its decisions without commercial considerations is frankly nonsense; every journalist gets their salary only because someone is prepared to pay for the product, and I find it hard to believe that this is the only time that C.B.S. news has fallen beneath a standard of 100% purity. In this final part, Mann orchestrates more scenes with big music, perhaps because there a less powerful drama beneath it. Moreover, it's never completely clear what exactly is unique about Wigland's information. Yet for three hours, Mann made me share in his characters' well justified fear of persecution. That's an achievement; and this (in my opinion) is his best film.",

Michael Mann's THE INSIDER is technically superior, similar to HEAT, but it's also rather cold and clinical which leaves you detached from the main action. It's also rather overlong and drawn out, telling a story which could have been more effective with an hour knocked off (not that I'm adverse to longer movies; I think THE IRISHMAN was just the right length). It's essentially an actor's showcase with Al Pacino and Russell Crowe fighting a lot, so it's entertaining in that respect, but I was expecting something more...",

When the film was over a lot of people came out complaining about the length and pointing out how half an hour could have been cut with NO loss to the story!

The story itself is not done as much justice as Bergman's Frontline piece gave it, but a lot of the important info is there. Wigand did a brave thing and the drama of the movie comes from his agonizing over why he did it, if it was worth it and how did he find the will to go through with it. Crowe's Wigand is a much more interesting accomplishment than Spacey's detached smartass in American Beauty. \nThe extreme close-ups of peoples' faces got really old really fast though.",

            "content": "I distinctly remember seeing 'The Insider' for the first time in an old traditional theater on the main city square of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, sometime in early 2000. I'm sure I went back to see it a second time while it was still showing there.I know I must have seen it several times more since then, because I can remember almost every important line from the movie. But re-watching it now, it still amazes me with its freshness, intensity, and artistry. The camera work and shots are surprising, and really caught my attention this time: the extreme closeups, the contrasts between light and shadow, as well as between the extreme focus and blurry parts of the shots.'The Insider' was a commercial failure. A flop. It lost at least $30 million for Touchstone Pictures and Disney (the film's distributor and the bigger studio behind Buena Vista Pictures). The film also didn't win any Oscars (it was nominated for 7) but was beat out in every category that year by 'American Beauty' -- by comparison, an inferior, over-hyped picture. And so 'The Insider' -- a movie with a serious grown-up story about a real-life issue with the most serious implications; a story touching on health, business and the news media; a complex film for thinking adults \u2013 couldn't attract audiences to the theater, without any shootouts, car chases, or explosions.It also happens to be Michael Mann's best film, for all the reasons just mentioned. Everyone involved rises to the occasion and is great in this: Bruce McGill, Diane Venora, Michael Gambon, Mister Philip Baker Hall, Gina Gershon, Colm Feore. And the major players have some of the best roles of their careers, playing real-life figures. Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace: smug, vain, and yet crotchety. Russell Crowe as Jeffrey Wigand: an anal, worried, stand-offish but tormented witness, trapped somewhere between his conscience and his comfort; his anger and resentment and the stable family life he once had. And Al Pacino as Lowell Bergman: the driven, self-righteous crusader for the freedom of the press, who has built a career seeing himself as the insatiable hound hunting after the truth -- And damn the consequences! (Best Pacino-as-reporter line: \"Everything interests me.\")Watching it now, supposedly from the moral-high-horse perspective of a smug ex-smoker, is also new for me. I started smoking -- like most young idiots -- to look cool. Which was something I learned at least partially from images of smoking I saw in the movies. The media image of smoking on screen seemed to communicate something adult, sophisticated, mysterious, cool \u2013 all the things that I wanted to be.... I was a heavy smoker over a period of about 18 years (on and off, quitting for at least 2 of those years). I smoked hundreds of packs, thousands of cigarettes in that time: Marlboro Reds, Gitanes Blondes, Gauloises Bleus, Marlboro 'Lights.' I only quit (this time, hopefully the last time) about a year ago. I am almost 43 years old. Statistically, this means I will probably die of some later medical problem related to those years I spent smoking. Fully 1/2 of smokers now living and smoking will die from smoking-related illnesses. Fifty per cent. Take a coin out of your pocket and flip it. Call it: heads you live, tails you die.I was smoking away years of my life, deliberately ignoring reality. I think about these things, too, as I re-watch this film.It's only right that Hollywood tries to even the score a little in this case. It would take another six years before the comedy 'Thank You for Smoking' appeared, in 2005. Two films: that's it. Two movies in the entire one-hundred-year history of cinema. Only two films to question the deadliest drug ever shown on film -- as opposed to the sanitized, idealized, romanticized version shown in thousands of films, over more than a hundred years. Another thing to think about as you watch 'The Insider.'",

I am not sure who should take most of the credit in a situation when everything falls into place so perfectly: the producer? the director? the Director of Photography, Dante Spinotti? ..... in the end, everyone of them can say, hand on heart, \"I delivered something truly great\".I wish i could honestly say i have the courage that the lead (in real life), Jeffery Wigand has. I read later in Time Magazine that he said: \"I make a difference. I feel good at the end of the day.\" I am glad that's how he feels despite the stress on the family that he experienced. To move from a $300k job to a $30k job is huge, but if takes you on the road to genuine peace, its worth it. Russell Crowe, who plays Wigand brilliantly permits the viewer to empathize with somebody moving from relative normality to being on the wrong side of a major corp.'s lawyers - and all the pressures that entails.As for the second of the two lead characters, Lowell Bergman, this guy, in real life, is the embodiment of traditional journalistic integrity, tenaciousness....., and as such, I can't imagine anybody doing a better job of portraying that role than Al Pacino.

The notoriously detail-oriented director has crafted such masterpieces as \"Heat\" and \"Collateral\", which transcend mere bullet operas and turn instead into wrenchingly violent character studies. However, in \"The Insider\", to quote Peter Travers, \"the characters shed no blood, only principles.\" A young Russell Crowe beefs up and grays down to play Jeffrey Wigand, and ex-Big Tobacco exec who wants to go on national TV and blow the whistle on some of his company's darker practices. 60 Minutes supervisor Lowell Bergman (a fiery Pacino, who gives an excellent performance, although bearing no resemblance to the real Bergman)fights to get Wigand on the air, while the CBS Brass, along with veteran reporter Mike Wallace (Chritopher Plummer)do their best to kill the story, fearing a lawsuit. Mann turns a real-life newsroom battle into a pulse-pounding thriller, complete with a tense score by Lisa Gerrard and Pieter Bourke, and superb cimenatography by the great Dante Spinotti. If you want a single scene that showcases all of this, I'll give you one; Wigand golfs at night, and is threatened by a Big Tobacco worker. By blurring the world around him and shooting the driving range in ominous greens and blacks, Mann gives us a look inside Wigand's indecision, anger, and isolation. Wow. This is one of the best films of the 90's.",

Crowe, with white hair and makeup, looks like hes in his fifties, but he was really only about 34. Honestly, I often forget just how young he is given his roles.Al Pacino delivers the standard Pacino acting job as Lowell Bergman, the former \"60 Minutes\" producer who wants Wigand to be a whistle-blower. He understands that Wigand is being threatened, but he doesn't anticipate CBS not wanting to air the interview. This puts Wigand in danger, and destroys his family life in the process. Pacino doesn't really look or sound anything like the real Lowell Bergman, but his acting talent works for the movie anyway.Michael Mann achieves another triumph with this fact-based account of recent history.

The adviser agrees to help but the journalist discovers he has much more sinister secrets to spill on studies into nicotine addiction and tobacco company policy. Inevitably, events spiral into a legal maelstrom of gagging orders, lawsuits and threatened libel action until ultimately both men start to doubt if what they are doing has any moral validity.This is a big film on a big subject and it's well made, but ultimately it's frustrating because it loses the thread of an important drama (the appalling depths the big tobacco firms will sink to in order to sell more of their addictive drugs and to cover up the evidence they are doing so) in favour of a much less interesting one (the reluctance of conservative media institutions to publish tough stories in the face of legal prosecution). It's also a little hard to judge because it's based on real events and people but it's also a Michael Mann film and therefore takes place in his highly stylised universe (the Crowe character is constantly worrying about money but always seems to be living in palatial accommodation). It also has some odd casting - Pacino and Plummer (as top US newsman Mike Wallace) are both very good, but Crowe is much too young, Venora and Crouse are wasted in decorative wife roles, and Gambon is just plain daft as a big US executive. In striving for realism, Mann loses his great gift for style and artistic excess, but the film is still fascinating and full of great moments, like the courtroom scene where McGill and Hauser chew each other out. In the end however, I would have preferred a shorter, fictional thriller about what might be happening in tobacco's sinister corridors of power than a rather stodgy drama about journalistic integrity.

This is overall a great movie about the topic with perfect characters, good direction, and an entertaining screenplay.Jeff Wingand (Russell Crowe) plays a paranoid research scientist who has just lost his job at a major tobacco company. Jeff soon loses his wife's trust in him and is on the verge of losing his family if he can't pay the bills and give his family dental care and health care which they need. Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) is a news reporter from the show 60 Minutes who travels all around the world to get stories from some of the most dangerous people, he is willing to do absolutely anything to get the complete story. When Lowell calls Jeff up and asks him if he can go over a simple report on flame resistances that involve cigarette burns, Lowell gets more than he bargained for. Jeff secretly hints that he knows a lot about the tobacco companies, so much he could bring them down himself if he had a chance in court. Lowell wants Jeff's full story at any costs because it would be the story of the year. Jeff has signed a waver though with his former company that he can not release any research information to the public or else they can financially hurt him or physically hurt him by any means nesscarry.The Insider starts out with a sample of Lowell's work as he travels to an Arabic country to get a report from an alleged terrorist leader, this is obviously very interesting to today's crowd. Russell Crowe plays his part perfectly as the paranoid scientist in that the way he talks, acts, and moves. Russell's character is always worried that his former tobacco company is going to hurt him and his family, and every instance he gets a hint of it he acts immediately in strange ways which are very interesting to watch. Al Pacino masters his role, just as he does for all his roles, there are no flaws in the acting in this movie. However the movie does exceed the three hour mark and tends to run a little slow near the end, but you'll be dying to see the conclusion because of all the hype about the release of the story during the movie.Michael Mann's movies are always fun to watch and this is no exception, this is his best work since Heat with Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.

There is a harmony among writing, acting, music and photography that is unequalled in my experience.

Although i have to dissagree with the bulk of his fans and say that this film is his best NOT Heat (it was still an awesome movie).I think my opinion of this film is slightly bias as i am a Huge fan of Al Pacino but even if they got an equally great actor for the same roll, it wouldn't cause this masterpiece to falter in any way.On the outset this does not look like an amazingly gripping film. The true story of a tabaco executive turned whistle blower doesn't make it sound as if it'll be ripe with action or suspence (which the average popcorn junkie craves). That said it's not action you go to see in a Michael Mann film. Even with Heat he brilliantly put characterisation first before the relentlessly violent action set pieces and he keeps the theme going here.There is no action to speak of in this film, just the agonising tension that builds from the moment Wigand (Russel Crowe on top form) is fired from his job and it doesn't let up.Pacino is his usual shouty self but that is what makes him so great. His role as 60 minutes producer Lowel Burhman is brilliantly played out as a man who can't take no for an answer. Watch his noticable dispair as he realises that they will NOT broadcast the show.There is nothing bad about this movie. Mann's direction is his best since the brilliant and gripping Manhunter. His use of slow motion is enough to make the Wachowski brothers quiver in their boots. Many of my friends complained about the length (over 2 1/2 hours) but these are the pop corn junkies i spoke of before. I was fortunate enough to catch this film at the cinema where the full glory of the cinematography was amazingly apparent.All in all this is a true masterpiece. Interlectual (which is rare in a film today), gripping, and truely truely fantastic in every sense of the word. This is by far Mann's best work to date and if he churns more gems out like this i will be a fan for many years to come.5/5",

Not just any whistle blower, but one for big tobacco and he tells his tale on the one place Corporations don't want to have their tales exposed: The TV Newsmagazine \"60 Minutes\". Does this sound like a fun film? A film that will get the teens going in droves or adults to shell out $8.00? No. But it did.The strengths of this film is based on the performances of the characters. as well as in the pacing and telling of the tale. Being that I am not a Russell Crowe fan, he made me a fan of his work with this film. He plays the lead character, the whistle blower Dr. Wygand and makes you really feel for him, his family, his decisions. matched well is the performance of Al Pacino who plays the Journalist/Producer for 60 minutes, Lowell. Al Pacino is as equally wonderful showing how stories are developed, produced and killed..in the corporate TV world of \"60 Minutes\".\"The Insider\" does one thing extremely well and it makes you an insider as you watch. You become involved in the Wygand story for sure, but you also get really involved with the workings of getting a story together for 60 Minutes and the bigger corporation, CBS. You realize getting a story together for \"60 Minutes\" isn't all that easy and even if you have a story -- the surrounding elements of competitive Journalism with Magazines and Newspapers as well as the Network you work can be a battle ground within itself.This is a look into real Journalism to tell the people of the Nation, of the World when something is endangering your life and how hard it is to get it on air, to face so much including lawsuits and jail just to tell a story -- make the public aware. This is before the \"spin\", before the \"politics\", before the looking for sexy entertainment value that has overtaken Journalism and TV today.

A fired vice president of the Brown and Williamson tobacco company talked with CBS--even though he was forbidden by a confidentiality agreement to talk about the company to anyone. His conscience was bothered by some of the unscrupulous and dangerous things the cigarette industry was covertly doing that made cigarettes even more dangerous. The film stars several Hollywood heavyweights--Al Pacino (the head of \"60 Minutes, Russell Crowe (the whistle-blower) and Christopher Plummer (as Mike Wallace) and is a rather straight forward version of the story.I agree with most of the reviews--\"The Insider\" is a very well-crafted film. However, it's also a case where the story, no matter how well made, is seriously flawed--at least to me. The theme of the film is how evil the tobacco companies are and how they knew that they were killing folks with their product. And, how this industry did its best to stop this story from being released by \"60 Minutes\". This is about as surprising as learning that pirates love booty, Nazis are evil or crack addicts love crack. Where is the story and where is the surprise?! Of course tobacco companies have been minimizing and denying that tobacco kills...DUH!!! They sell a product that kills people and they've been making it seem fun and glamorous for as long as they've been selling the product!! To me it's a no-brainer and frankly not that interesting. Plus, anyone who does choose to smoke is amazingly stupid--as we've known that cigarettes kill for many decades. So, while I respect the film for its quality, the story did nothing for me.",

            "content": "Corporate greed is one facet of American life that is hidden often from public scrutiny. Unfortunately, many multi-billion dollar corporations are only interested in profits at the expense of Americans' health and welfare. In short, we the public pay for corporate executives' multi-million-dollar mansions, their planes, and their vacations, and we often do it without realizing what we are compromising in terms of our life. \"The Insider\", based on the real-life incidents of corporate informer Jeffrey Wigand, is one of the few American films to date that deals truthfully with the lies and corruption of American corporations.Jeffrey Wigand (played with exceptional emotionalism by Russell Crowe) was fired from the tobacco company Brown and Williamson when he could not condone the company's use of ingredients in their products to perpetuate addiction to nicotine. To add insult to injury, the corporation began threatening Wigand and his family to scare them into honoring a confidentiality agreement that basically compelled him from revealing corporate wrong-doing to the public. The film starts with the day Wigand leaves the offices of Brown and Williamson. He is then approached by Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), then one of the top journalist-producers for 60 Minutes, to analyze some documents from Philip-Morris.Bergman then discovers that Wigand has a story to tell. Wigand at first declines, using the confidentiality agreement as his reason. The film becomes how and why Wigand eventually agrees to be interviewed on camera, and the many twists and turns that occur in the process. Simultaneously, a class action lawsuit in Mississippi is brewing concerning the seven major tobacco companies, and they compel Wigand to testify there as well. Then in an interesting and unexpected twist, CBS corporate begins to pressure CBS News about withholding the Wigand story. Its reasoning: the CBS corporation was in the midst of a buy-out that would earn millions for top corporate executives that might be compromised if the there was a threat of a lawsuit from Brown and Williamson.The film is a tour-de-force triumph not only about corporate greed, but also how network corporate executives, and not journalists, are having more and more of a say on what stories are aired and what stories never leave the editing room if the corporation fears that the story is not in their best interests. The film becomes as much about an issue that is now plaguing our entire American democracy as it is about corporate consumer products: the freedom of the press to expose stories that are in the public interest as oppose to corporate interests. As a side note, the late Ed Bradly produced a story for 60 Minutes exposing President Bush's misleading the public about the War in Iraq that has not, at this writing, ever been aired.",

Michael Mann did an outstanding job of maintaining tension throughout the film, perhaps best exemplified in the scenes with lots of yelling, such as Wigand calling up Bergman after his confidence had been betrayed, the courtroom scene and the multiple times Bergman argued with his superiors.On the negative side, I found the accent of Wigand's wife (Diane Venora) very off-putting and felt that maybe 5-10 minutes of the film could have been shaved off.",

            "content": "There are very few films that last over two and a half hours that can keep my attention from waning even just a bit.  Sometimes it will just be a two second `what time is it?' check, sometimes a more involved interruption depending on the quality and pacing of the film.  `The Insider' is so well done that had I not been interrupted a couple of times, I would not have strayed from the film for even a moment.  Its perfect pacing takes it from `really good' status to `great' status.Russell Crowe is unrecognizable as Jeffrey Wigand, a middle aged, pudgy and graying former tobacco industry scientist who, after being fired for expressing an unpopular opinion of their procedures, is harassed to the point of near insanity by said company when he threatens to tell all on `60 Minutes'.  Al Pacino plays Lowell Bergman, a senior producer on the show who fights to get the story, then finds himself in the position of having to deal with the fact that CBS won't air the show for fear of retribution.\nIf this film were not a true story, it would be incredible, but the fact that it is based on true events is both mind-boggling and compelling at the same time.  Wigand is an almost Shakespearean character in that he has to make some unbelievably difficult decisions, where the results aren't going to necessarily be good for anyone, and Crowe is masterful in this role. Pacino is always good, but he is all energy and fire in this film as we see him struggle with this incredible string of events.  Michael Mann can't make a film under two and a half hours, but that isn't even a factor in this film because the pacing is perfect and without any dry moments or gaps.  The cinematography is interesting in that the lighting almost has a blue haze to it, yet it maintains its sharpness.  Unfortunately, the film has a cheesy soundtrack since Mann can't get out of the 80's, but it is a minute criticism because no film can be perfect.  Watch this film when you have a couple of hours where you are not going to be interrupted, because this is one movie that is going to hold your attention for its entirety.  With tour de force performances, a compelling plot and excellent film making, `The Insider' is a film that deserves all of the accolades it received when it was released and since.--Shelly",

It is more than just a movie for those who want to learn how to be a journalist (which is not my case). It is a very intense movie. The whole movie is full of tension, which is combined with strong suspense, comparable to a thriller (except with no violence). Not the most exciting thing to watch, but definitely a powerful film which happens to be based in a real story.The big downside of this movie is its long runtime of almost 2 hours and a half, which makes it become a little tiring during the last 20 minutes. If only Michael Mann had give me the script I would have deleted 20 minutes of it and made it a shorter movie. I can't lie to you: this movie requires patience. Once you get used to it, things become more natural, but still... lots of patience is needed to watch this movie, as well as a good mood.Besides the intense story, this movie has also solid performances by the actors. For example, Al Pacino is great as usual. Russell Crowe is really good in this role, much better than in any of those which he was nominated Best Actor. Cristopher Plummer has a strong presence too. And Bruce McGill is terrific, being simply incredible when he loses his temper and shouts the line \u00abWipe that smirk off your face!\u00bbThe soundtrack is good. The dark/noir-like atmosphere is good too. The quotes are, most of them, very good. The scenario varies a lot - it goes from exotic places/sceneries to extremely simple and sometimes crude backgrounds, but this combination doesn't work badly.The nervous and tense Jeffrey Wigand is the main character of the movie. He lives such a conflict situation that I wouldn't want to be in his skin. I wouldn't want to go through a dilemma like that.Despite being a quite dramatic and intense film, it also has its big moments of comedy. After all, even the most dramatic stories usually have their own moments of comedy.",

We'll see how he tackles a complex subject like Ali later this year, but fortunately for us, he has given what may be the best movie of the 90s.I do not know how R.Crowe does it, but somehow he captured the essence of an otherwise normal, scientific everyman put into a pressure cooker and forced to squirm out from underneath it. The scene in the hotel room, when he and Al Pacino first meet: this is such a wonderful scene. Full of subtle clues and clever and affecting writing/direction and acting. Watch how Lowell (Pacino) who knows nothing about Jeffrey (Crowe) and what he has to say measures him and equally impressive is Jeffrey's nervous assertion of Lowell. At one point later in the film, Jeffery remarks he cannot find the parameters to effectively make a decision. Spoken like a true man of science. His crumbling under the weight of his life is entirely palpable as is Lowell steadfast resolve to stick to his guns, despite being under his own legal and professional stress.I could go on and on but I won't except to say that I hope Michael Mann and his team continue to create excellent dramatic stories that require us, the viewer, to use our brains and watch the movie with patience and attention.",

            "review_title": "Beautiful Portrait Of The Human Condition",
            "content": "Michael Mann has made one of my favorite modern movies: The Insider is everything I expect to find in a movie. Time has not treated it well, it was completely overlooked at the Oscars and has been sadly forgotten in recent years in detriment of more catchy 1999 movies like American Beauty, The Sixth Sense, and Being John Malkovich. I don't understand why: The Insider is a masterpiece with great production values and quality; its screenplay is engaging, it depicts the human condition with intelligence, maturity and tenderness; one can feel Jeffrey Wigand's frustrations and anger, cry over his personal problems, rejoice in his battle for the truth against tobacco companies; he's one of the most complex and complete characters because of the way Mann balances his feelings with his many flaws; he's not perfect, but for his sacrifices and losses throughout the movie, I believe he's one of the best heroes in recent American Cinema, of the same stuff Atticus Finch and Will Kane are made of.Mann's great achievement is picking up a slice of life and turning it engaging: Jeffrey Wigand, former CEO for tobacco company fights for the public's right to know the truth about this industry. It seems rather dull, but Mann focuses on the everyday consequences of his actions, marital arguments, divorce, restraining orders, possibly jail. The Insider really shows ordinary people caught up and left alone in cruel, extraordinary situations and that makes great drama to watch! I find fascinating how far the tobacco companies will go to stop Jeffrey from saying what he knows, the threats to his family, the psychological blackmail; CBS's fear of airing his interview is their last gambit and it was fascinating to watch the backstage functioning of a big network, the discussions between the top people that the common man is unaware of, their daily fear of litigations, and the efforts of good journalists like Lowell Bergman to show the truth.Russell Crowe plays Jeffrey Wigand, a man torn between exposing the truth and keeping his mouth shut to protect his family and their well-being; it's not even physical aggression he fears, more things that are in most people's minds: how will he pay the mortgage on the cars and house, who will put food on their table, how will they pay college? Jeffrey's a high-middle class guy and his greatest fear is how his actions will hurt his family economically. It's something many people can relate with. Crowe is brilliant in this role, to me it's his best one to date; without many words he manages to convey several feelings and emotional states just through body language, facial expressions and small mannerisms and ticks. He never tells directly what's on his mind, but he shows it with great clarity. Jeffrey's major flaw is his lack of social skills to deal with emotional situations; he's always hot-headed and gets angry easily, and his failure to communicate with his wife, Liane, when she's not coping so well with his problems, lead to abandon and divorce. Diane Venora is great at playing Liane, it's easy to find her rather cold and uncaring for the way she abandons Jeffrey, but I think her character was well-written as a wife who tried to stand alongside her husband, only he didn't want her support: Jeffrey had it coming on this one.Al Pacino is also fantastic as Lowell Bergman, a 60 Minutes journalist who fights against CBS to air his interview with Jeffrey so his efforts and personal tragedies weren't in vain. Pacino steals the last third of the movie in this quest, overshadowing Crowe's performance. I feel he should have gotten a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his strong performance. The movie's climax is beautiful, and one of the most cathartic moments in cinema since Andy Dufresne's escape in The Shawshank Redemption. I love the song 'Sacrifice' playing while the interview is finally being aired as the camera keeps cutting to several characters in the movie as they all watch it on TV. It's a feel-goody moment because everyone wants Jeffrey's efforts to be worthwhile and not just in vain. More importantly, being it based on a true story, it's not just mindless happy ending to please crowds: it's the truth, and it should remind all these people who hate happy endings because they're 'unrealistic' that, yes, there are happy endings in the real world too! The music is beautiful in this movie \u0097 I love 'Iguazu' playing when Jeffrey is on his way to a court to testify against the tobacco companies. 'Meltdown' is another beautiful song. Mann is a great filmmaker: his use of camera angles is always refreshing and his cinematography is just visually engaging. The Insider, to me, deserved to have swept several Oscars: Best Picture, Director and Actor. I'm not sure about Best Adapted Screenplay, The Talented Mr. Ripley had a best one in my opinion. As things stand, both movies were ignored in 1999 by the Academy. It's something I regret but changes nothing to me: The Insider will always remain as the best movie of 1999 to me.",

I just have to say that Al Pacino and Russell Crowe were excellent and it most certaintly deserved the seven Academy Award nominations it was given.Pacino stars as Lowell Bergman, producer of CBS's 60 minutes, who in order to finish a story on the use of tobacco and its effect on the public, must be provided information by an \"inside\" source.  That source is a former tobacco executive, Doctor Jeffrey Wigand(Crowe).  Wigand was fired by a large tobacco company and agrees to help Bergman in that the company is using unethical stimulants to make their cigarettes.  Dante Spinotti is Mann's director of photography in just about all his movies and he is great. The cinematography of this film was outstanding.  I especially liked how they zoomed in on the characters faces when something dramatic in the story occured.  You could really see the effect of what was happening on the characters' faces.  Once again, Michael Mann used colored lighting, just as he did in the film HEAT and some parts in MANHUNTER.

Excellent performances laced with a splendid editing job that makes the film all the more alive and exciting. Plus the musical score is truly unique.Russell Crowe, in his first Oscar-nominated role gives a very low key performance reminiscent of his work in L.A. Confidential. Not that those two movies were anywhere near similar, but Crowe has a way of understatement in both films that is rare for an actor today. To compare, look at Al Pacino's performance. He has the flashy role of the TV-producer and boy, does he ever take advantage of it. The only times when he shows near restraint is in his scenes with Crowe. The scenes they share also has some touching moments and Pacino has never been more likable. The one thing that Pacino totally nails is the opening scene where he interviews the Arab (I forget what he is). You believe that he really is a news producer in the way the scene is set up and the way Pacino plays it.There are many more familiar faces throughout, but the one who truly made an impression is Bruce McGill in the rather small role of Wigand's attorney. The way he comes off as a good IL' boy when interviewing Wigand and the way he turns it around is pure gold. There are other small roles throughout by good actors like Debi Mazar, Stephen Tobolowsky and even a cameo by one of the real live persons who was involved in the case. Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace does a good job but somehow he comes off as a bit of an oath. We never see why he was such a good host on 60 minutes.One thing I think was a bit disappointing was the way the focus shifted from Wigand to Pacino's character, Lowell Bergman. By the end I had enough of Pacino's turn as the wronged producer who turns it all around in his favor. In one scene we see Wigand at a job interview for a teacher position but we don't see why the principal, who had doubts hiring him, changed her mind. We also are denied a closing scene of how Wigand reacted when the piece of his interview finally aired in it's full form. Those are minor quibbles though, as I think that Mann keeps the integrity of the story on a high level through most of the film and it was a shame that it was so snubbed by the Academy but a little thing called American Beauty was apparently more attractive at that time.",

The audience does not watch The Insider - it walks alongside the camera as two men, 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) and tobacco industry whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), put everything they have at stake to make sure the world finds out that the tobacco companies deliberately misled the public over the knowledge they had of their product's effects.  It is a raw, powerful, engaging experience, with Pacino and Crowe at the top of their game (as well as a fine supporting turn by Christopher Plummer as 60 Minutes anchor Mike Wallace) providing masterful compliments to Mann's blistering direction.

They certainly make it seem like there's some significant danger for the main characters. I think the primary reason that I found the film a bit underwhelming was simply because it didn't feel like the stakes were as high as the movie was implying. Yes, the men involved faced severe opposition and standing up to the tobacco industry caused them great personal frustration. But it never seemed their lives were in danger. Likewise, the content of their \"groundbreaking\" story is such old news to me, and I struggle to understand why it mattered so much. Was it really that shocking to people in 1996 that cigarette corporations knew their products were life-threatening and that they actively worked to make them more addictive? I was in my late teens at that time, and I'm pretty sure that I assumed all of this was true.Despite all of my issues, when I was able to go with the flow and accept the story of The Insider as a high stakes endeavor, I found some enjoyment from it. The tone and atmosphere is excellent and offers plenty of nervous tension throughout. I appreciated the performance of Al Pacino, because he isn't over-the-top and crazy like he has become in many modern movies. I do wish they had cast someone more charismatic and interesting than Russell Crowe to play the lead role. However after watching the actual interview, it doesn't seem like Wigand is all that exciting, so perhaps Crowe was delivering the performance just right. Which brings me to my other important positive about The Insider. It was not a perfect movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it did interest me enough that I made a point of seeking out the original video of WIgand's 60 Minutes interview. I suppose, for a movie based on a true story, that's a big win. The Insider might have lacked something for me, but at least I was intrigued.",

Well he failed. The difference is that ATPM was about the Constitution and this movie is about smoking. So it was hard to get excited about it. Michael Mann tried to use some of the tricks he used in 'Heat' - but it just didn't work since the subject was a bespecaled scientist with a PHd. This is another movie (The Green Mile is another) that is *way* too long. On the positive side, the acting is good - even Al Pacino tried to constrain his over-acting tendencies. But overall - pretty boring, too long - and another reason why American Beauty should sweep the Oscars. One other comment - the film was based on a program made in 1994 yet (small) mobile phones, the Internet and e-mail were seen. Sloppy directing.",

            "content": "Whenever someone hears about the big tobacco industries, they think big money and not to be meddled with. But in 1994, one man changed all that. One man stood up to this giants of industry and told them off. In 1999, director Michael Mann retold this story in grade A fashion.The Insider deals with the CBS 60 Minutes special involving the tobacco company Brown & Williams and their former researcher Dr. Jeff Wigand (Russell Crowe). 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) will go to great lengths to get this man to talk about his work with the company. What he has to get around is the confidentiality agreement that Wigand signed. Now that he has been fired for a bogus reason, he wants to get back at the company that now threatens his family. Bergman tries to bend the rules and go around every corner to get this man to testify in a court of law so that his testament will not be liable with the confidentiality agreement.With B&W watching every move that Wigand makes and checking everything that has happened to him from birth up to this point in time, Wigand is ready to do anything. Before he even appearers in court, he records an interview with 60 Minutes host Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer). This interview may not go on the air at all if certain things aren't made right. What Bergman must do now is protect Wigand and still air this special without causing any trouble because he knows that this will be the biggest case in US history.Crowe and Pacino both give breathtaking performances. Crowe was nominated for his portrayal of Wigand and was well deserved. Wigand is an interesting character. He has to make the right choices without hurting his reputation, his family, and without breaking the deal with his former company. The decisions he makes are both life changing and have an impact on those around him. Pacino as Bergman is the perfect fit. He is an explosive actor and very passionate with his work. His work in this movie is incredible. He combines a soft heart with a hard-nose attitude that gives him a very powerful presence. These two men are great and even Plummer as Wallace gives a great performance. His character is both working for the people so they are informed, and working for CBS, making sure they don't go under with this story. All together, there is a great cast with smaller parts even shinning, especially Bruce McGill as Ron Motley, one of the lawyers working with Wigand.The Insider is a must see. This political thriller is a great watch and showcases two of today's top actors doing what they do best. Director Michael Mann is no stranger when it comes to good movies. His hits like The Last of the Mohicans(1992), Heat (1995), Ali(2001), and most recently Collateral(2004). The Insider is one of his best films to date. The Insider is a great film...and that's the truth.",

Russell Crowe was thirty four when he played the role,eighteen years younger than the real Jefferey Wigand. A grey haired wig and some makeup was used to make him appear older but it really looks like a younger man wearing a wig. He still is a talented actor and delivers with a meritorious performance.This film starts off on a prosepectible trajectory but it quickly evaporates. This film doesn't progress or escalate and merely circles about. It doesn't sail forward but drifts sideways. Initially the plot is more centered on Wigand and his family. However,as it continues its focus centers on Al Pacino's character and his conflict with CBS and Brown & Williamson. As a matter of fact, towards the end you start looking back and wonder if that was the same movie.Wigand's whistleblowing lead to lawsuits of hundreds of billions of dollars and the way governments view the tobbacco industry. But how much did this affect the public ? Cigarette consumption didn't decrease due to these events,at least not by a sizable margin. It's something worth noting.",

            "content": "Mark Kermode in his March 2000 Sight and Sound review said: \u0091\u0085The Insider ought to walk off with a basket of Oscars in March.' He goes on to say, of course, that it won't (and it didn't) and that Michael Mann and his movie \u0091should be proud to be outsiders.'The fact is that the reason The Insider did not gain a single Oscar was because it was too risky. It treated a subject (whether or not the tobacco industry was involved in chemically treating its cigarettes to enhance their addictive properties) which was in its way as political as the equally neglected, and equally brilliant, Bulworth last year. It used as its basis a current affairs article and named names. Result: few people in Ipswich, or elsewhere outside London, can have had a chance to see this film, which was rapidly eclipsed on its release by the admittedly arresting American Beauty and the trivial efficiency of The Talented Mr Ripley.A word about Michael Mann. Famous, some would prefer infamous, as the creator of Miami Vice, his feature film work has lent towards more challenging themes while retaining the surface sheen of that cops and robbers series. Manhunter (1988) anticipated The Silence of the Lambs in being a film about serial killers with Hannibal Lector as touchstone, but had a cop who was as screwed up as his quarry. The Last of the Mohicans (1992) brought visceral excitement to the costume adventure and Heat (1995, also with Pacino) returned to the hunter/hunted identification of Manhunter while returning the urban thriller to the chic of Bullitt after years of French Connection grittiness. All his films demonstrate Mann's qualities as a stickler for detail, a director ready to take a chance with a shot, holding it for longer than most would dare, and someone who likes to get inside the psyche of the macho male (pardon the tautology). The classic Mann shot has one of his characters silhouetted against a landscape, set below an evening sky in contemplation of his destiny, all with sensuous electronic music over the top. He is the thinking man's action movie director.The Insider is in a way a change of direction: this is not an action film but an investigation, in the manner of All the President's Men or JFK . The setting is TV and the programme Sixty Minutes. Bergman (Pacino), the show's producer, receives anonymous documents casting dubious light on the tobacco industry and approaches Wigand (Crowe), a recently fired research and development employee for Brown and Williamson. And so it goes, the familiar twists and turns followed with precision and without condescension to melodrama or hyperbole. B&W sweat and threaten, CBS loses its cool, individual integrity is on the line. We've been here before, as so often in the movies, but rarely with such conviction and professionalism.Pacino continues his recent spate of plum roles with a super performance as the man at the controls, a part he has made his own since The Godfather Part Two. Russell Crowe, in a part quite different to that in this Summer's Gladiator, is a stocky, greying, reluctant hero, and more than fulfills the promise of LA Confidential. The supporting cast, from Plummer's unctuous presenter to Gershon's acid corporate lawyer, all pull their weight, no doubt glad to be speaking a literate script for a director with a vision.",

Two of the absolute finest actors of our time, Al Pacino and Russell Crowe, are both at the peak of their game in this incredible movie. I was especially impressed by Russell Crowe who I think is even better in this movie than he was in Gladiator. The acting really brings this movie to the even greater heights, but I think it really needed supreme acting since it's so important that the characters in the movie are well portrayed because the movie is very realistic, and the way the people respond to the things that happen to them in the story is very realistic.The story of the movie is also done very well and even though the movie surpasses 2 hrs and 30 minutes it never even gets close to get tiring or boring because of the extremely entertaining story which is consistently being delivered at a very constant high pace, so there is never a dull moment.  It's a movie that stirs up great anger towards the tobacco company, and it's the type of movie who leaves me as a non-smoker asking myself: Don't already people know it's no good for yourself to smoke, so then why is it so special when new information about the tobacco-companies is released? That's a question I don't know the answer for.I think the movie is entertaining because of the acting and because of the way Russell Crowe's character is being chased by tobacco companies and, the sad part is that those kind of things do actually happen, you sometimes hear about smoking documentaries not being able to air because of anonymous threats.  This movie is a great way of showing how criminal the tobacco companies actually are.",

I am suggesting that the \"big name cast\" was simply being put on display for as long as possible and let the chips fall where they may.

On the other hand Al Pacino and Russell Crowe seem over exposed to the point of weariness, and I definitely felt that less would have been best. - MERK",

I'm also one of those people who believe that if you are going to try to get your audience to accept your agenda in telling a socially motivated story, you need to do it in a way that will get their attention easily, and with three legendary actors in the film (Pacino, Plummer and the much younger but highly respected Crowe), I was intrigued, but that didn't make me really interested in a network news show's research on the subject matter that I probably would have not tuned into had I saw it advertised prior to airing. Corporate corruption to make their product more appealing to users has always been a major issue, but if it's not a product you're interested in, why spend time boring yourself with it?The three actors are playing real life people, and Christopher Plummer as long time 60 Minutes anchor Mike Wallace is definitely perfect casting. That being said, Al Pacino as a 60 minutes producer and Russell Crowe as a corporate whistleblower fired from his job are equally as mesmerizing, and coming at a time when Pacino had the tendency to bray every line out of every script he was ever given, he does unimpressive job of toning it down. The supporting cast is very impressive, but the script and the direction are flawed and over-confident, and at two and a half hours, the film drags like a case of cigarettes smoked one after another by the same user. This is a film that will be important in the future probably to journalists or anti-corporate or anti-media activists, but for the rest of us, it's a boring, overly long lecture with some impressive elements, tedious and frustrating.",

            "content": "\"The Insider\" is an American, mostly English-language movie from 1999, so this one had its 20th anniversary last year. The director is Michael Mann and he is also one of the writers credited here. The other man in charge of the screenplay was Eric Roth and this is not the only occasion that these two have collaborated. Roth is even an Oscar winner for \"Forrest Gump\", an achievement that Mann has not managed yet although he is certainly the most known crew member attached to this project. Marie Brenner also needs to be mentioned here as she is the one who was in charge of the article this film is based on. You don't see it too often that films are based on articles, but Brenner is a bit of an expert there. And now, two decades later, she was connected to the new Oscar-nominated Clint Eastwood movie \"Richard Jewell\" too. Long career, props to her. Back to this one here. By the way, don't mistake it for a black-and-white movie because of the poster here on imdb. As you would expect from a film from the year 1999, this is a color movie. And a pretty long one at that with comfortably over 2.5 hours. Still, it is by no means Mann's longest film. One that is longer is \"Heat\", a movie he made briefly before this one and that one is probably even more famous than this one here. There are some differences and parallels between these films. Both have Pacino and in both films he is the good guy. While \"Heat\" is a story of antagonists, this one here is a tale of cooperators. I would not really call them friends.Also Mann has a tendency to include males at the center of his films, not females. There are females, but usually they do not get beyond the romantic partner part and this film is no exception. The men are in control (or hope they are) in Michael Mann's films. Very fitting last name too for this approach. The other lead actor in here, the one on the bottom of the poster, is Russell Crowe. He was in his mid30s here when this was made and not a big star yet. This changed quickly, however, as he managed an Oscar nomination for his portrayal here and it was the first of three Oscar nominations for him (and countless other awards and nominations) within a short period of time. He soon turned into Australia's biggest Hollywood actor and he sure still has a shot nowadays to fit this description, even if many may argue for Jackman instead. Oh wait, Crowe is from New Zealand I see? My bad then. Not much of a contest there I suppose. Anyway, I like Crowe and definitely need to catch up on some of his older (and newer) projects. But I must still say that Al Pacino (who just turned 80) has risen considerably in the ranking of my favorites over the last five or ten years and no hesitation for me in saying he gave the best performance in this movie, maybe is even the best thing about the movie. Sadly, his turn pretty much got ignored completely by awards bodies. Massive disapproval from me here. And massive approval for his turn. He is this good really.The two also do not have as many scenes together as you could imagine. There is a bit of a clean structure in here. The parts early on are about them meeting and cooperating, but then, even if still in touch, their shared screen time becomes considerably less and we see either fighting his own fight and demons. Crowe's character has mostly to deal with the consequences that the interview has on his family and how his life is so deteriorating from it that his wife decides to break up. Also the ways in which we see his powerful former employer still have a massive impact on his life are crucial here. There's cars following him and of course the bullet scene in the mailbox as well as the computer virus are easy to remember. I must say I found the bullet scene a bit exaggerated, but apparently from what the closing credits imply, it actually happened like this, so I have to correct myself and I am really fine with it. And as for Pacino's character, he is mostly fighting with his broadcaster and against the decision to remove the interview from the show because it could result in serious consequences for the channel. There are references about his family too, but they are considerably smaller than those linked to Crowe's character.Here and there, I had to think of Matt Damon's \"The Informant!\" (from ten years later) while watching this movie, even if I preferred Damon's turn over Crowe's. Maybe my favorite Damon performance ever. So it means something. And a bit also of \"Frost/Nixon\" in terms of tone and atmosphere at least and of course the media element, even if the two main characters in that film are also opponents and the ones in this one we have here are not. It is a pretty long film as I said earlier, but I don't think it dragged too much. There were certainly scenes that could have been left out and it would not have hurt the film, maybe even helped it, but yeah, it is all tolerable and quite an achievement to come up with a film like this that does not drag too much despite the running time. It does not fly by either unfortunately as you can see from my rating, but there are maybe two or three great moments nonetheless. The scene with Crowe's character getting the phone call by Pacino's character telling him that they will not release the interview is heartbreaking to watch kinda. We know the protagonist had lost everything at that point already. He sacrificed his marriage, his job and his reputation too for justice to come into effect and there it seems as if it is not going to happen. But there is a twist and a happy ending too you could say and you see that if television channels won't pull through with the truth, there is still newspapers coming up with the pressure. Here it is the New York Times eventually helping the interview to get published. This makes Pacino's character really happy. Well, what can you say about the man. He is tremendous. Especially his monologues and speeches to other characters are always as good as it gets and probably nobody is better when it comes to those, not just in this film, but also in general.Comedy is rare in this film because Crowe's character is the opposite of a joker and Pacino's also not too much, but the \"Alice in Wonderland\" quote was fun on one occasion. What else can I say here? This film was very successful with awards bodies back then. Look at all the Oscar nominations (including for Best Director and Best Picture), even if it did not win a single one of them. But yeah, like I said: It's difficult for me anyway to accept those with Pacino getting so critically snubbed. Also about this film, a bit unusual that both protagonists were not only still alive back in 1999 when this film got made, but are both still alive today and hopefully also still when you read this review a couple years from now. Interestingly enough, they are both almost the exact same age while Crowe is considerably younger here than Pacino, almost 25 years in fact, even if Pacino looks younger than late 50s for sure too. Oh yes, the tobacco industry is crucial in here too because this field of profession is Crowe's character's background. And I spoke about comedy earlier, but it is also pretty funny in a bittersweet way how the tobacco industry/companies really managed to do away with all the responsibility and blame their buyers instead for all that happened to them because of cigarette consumption. But yeah, now in 2020, cigarettes are really far from being as edgy and cool as they were ten years ago, let alone 20 years ago. People tend to wake up. I mentioned the two leads a lot, but really everybody from the cast deserves a thumbs-up. Extremely strong ensemble performance and maybe this would have been a deserved Oscar had such a category been in existence then. It's not even now in 2020. Christopher Plummer, the epitome of the amazing Hollywood supporting actor, once again shows us his class. He also has a few really good, sometimes even funny, moments and I am glad he is in here. Slightly less impactful is Philip Baker Hall, an actor who is always easy to identify, but with whom you do not always remember the name. Plummer and Baker Hall are both around the age of 90 now and still alive. Hopefully for a while.The legal references I also found interesting in this film. How being in another state kept Crowe's character from being prosecuted, but how the \"third-party law\" (you know what I mean) posed a crucial danger to his interview and the future of one of America's biggest broadcasting stations. So yeah, overall no hesitation for me in giving this one a thumbs-up. It's a pretty strong David vs. Goliath story with major focus on scandal, the tobacco industry and, most of all, the press. If these are subjects that you do not despise in films, it's time to check this one out. It's a good film I'd say, maybe even still a bit on the underseen side, probably because it is very bleak from beginning to end and there are hardly any exceptions. Also what makes the entire thing even more meaningful is that it is based on actual characters and a story that at least loosely happened the way it is depicted here. Sometimes reality comes up with the most thrilling tales. Okay, maybe \"thrilling\" is not the right word to describe this film, but you know what I mean. \"Important\" could be it. So yeah, go for it, especially if you like Crowe and Pacino as much as I do. Or some of the supporting players. Torn and Crouse I have not mentioned yet and both have small parts. More familiar faces for sure. Positive recommendation, even if I must say that sadly it did not get me curious to read about how the entire situation really unfolded back then!",

Beyond this, the movie misses really the point and take its audience for small brains: i'm not a scientist, but with millions of smokers who can't stop the habit, i think people has already deduced that cigarettes were addictive !

Now my main gripe & my very low rating is for the music.One of the most aggravatingly bad scores,There are some supposed songs (you cant make out any lyrics at all), That is so annoying you wonder what is happening to  film music now a days.Also it is overly long & quite boring. The 158 minute length is way too long, An hour could have been easily cut.Respectivly submittedJay  Harris",

No trademark Michael Mann shootings or chase-scenes but great acting, great dialog, a great script and great music. Based on true events but slightly altered for dramatic reasons, The Insider is a top notch thinking man's thriller. Pacino in one of his best roles of the '90s, Russell Crowe in his best role ever and a supporting cast to match. Christopher Plummer (!),Philip Baker, HallBruce McGill,...the list of fine actors goes on and on.A must see if you like intelligent political thrillers with fine acting.",

            "content": "This movie is based on a true story and depicts the two men's fight against the tobacco industry in U.S. One day, Jeffrey Wigand (acted by Russell Crowe) gets fired by Brown & Williamson, a big tobacco company. He is familiar with science and health and deeply knows that tobaccos are harmful to their health. However, all tobacco companies in U.S. claim that tobaccos are NOT toxic in order to maintain commercial benefits. Furthermore Brown & Williamson threatens Wigand and his family not to tell the truth about tobaccos' harm. Wigand cooperates with a journalist, Lowell Bergman (acted by Al Pacino) and they try to disclose the secret. However, they encounter plenty of difficulties arranged by Brown & Williamson.Though you may think first 30 minutes is boring, as a whole, this is certainly interesting. In the middle of this movie, Wigand and Bergman hit so many obstacles that they seem to be up against the wall. But nevertheless, Wigand's willpower and Bergman's journalism overcome the awful situation in the end of the story. It leaves a quite agreeable aftertaste.In addition to the great plot, their acting, camera work and music are also excellent. They enable us to feel sympathetic to main character's anger, depression and bravery. I strongly recommend you to watch this great work at any rate.

Micheal Mann has a style of directing that influenced other directors and it really works in this movie. It's a shame that this movie faltered when it came to the box office earning when the movie itself beats most movies that are Hollywood. But when it comes to box office earnings it's like that for most of his movies. But in this case it's understandable because this isn't a movie of the mass audience although it's a good movie. Especially since you have to focus a lot to the dialogue in order to understand what is going on. Al Pacino is good in this but Russell Crowe is excellent for this role. This has a ambitious journalist/producer for CBS news Lowell Bergman(Al Pacino) going after Jeffrey Wigand(Russell Crowe) who is a man of integrity but works for major tobacco company as general manager but gets fired for big information that can be breaking news. And these vital information can help others in a positive manner. But he is under a confidential agreement which he tries to keep but is being pushed around to the point of breaking. In another words he is the insider of one of one of the biggest company. The execution of this movie is very well done although it takes patience to get use to and it's not a big shock that this movie was nominated for 7 Academy Award Nominations. However if your looking for a action thriller this movie will not be for you. But what this is, is a realistic and intelligent approach to a journalist and a insider with some excellent dialogue.

            "review_title": "solid docudrama",
            "content": "Corporate whistle blowing makes for ideal storytelling material, coming fully equipped, as it does,  with many of the raw elements of great drama. For who can resist the spectacle of an Everyman underdog, driven by a courageous sense of personal righteousness and love of humanity, laying his integrity, his livelihood, often even his life itself on the line in the pursuit of truth and justice?Based on real life events, in which \"60 Minutes\" compromised its journalistic integrity by buckling under to pressure from the tobacco industry not to run an interview with a whistle blower,  Michael Mann's \"The Insider\" provides a solid, often gripping and always interesting drama that works on several levels simultaneously: as an expose of the shocking moral turpitude occurring at the upper levels of many of our nation's corporate structures, as a view of the life-and-death power struggle that takes place in a legal system awash in corruption and mind-boggling complexity, and as an incisive examination of two men's epic struggle with morality and ethics and the exigencies of doing the right thing in a world where doing the wrong is often both easier and more handsomely rewarded.Russell Crowe stars as former tobacco executive Dr. Jeffrey Wigand, who, upon being fired for no accountable reason by his company, agrees to tape an interview for \"60 Minutes\" on which he plans to expose the tobacco industry's secret practice of enhancing the nicotine-based addiction levels in cigarettes.  Al Pacino plays \"60 Minutes\" producer Lowell Bergman, who befriends Wigand and talks him into granting the interview.  As `60 Minutes' itself succumbs to the pressure of the corporate entity, the film becomes, essentially, a study of TWO whistle blowers, for Bergman, every bit as much as Wigand, must question his commitment to the company he has so long served and admired.  While the two cope with their ever increasing moral dilemmas, the real life drama plays itself out, as Mann casts a scathing eye on corporate malevolence, judicial malfeasance, and, above all, journalistic timidity and compromise.  Admirably, Mann never takes his focus off the human drama at the core and he is assisted in that by the first rate performances of his two lead actors.  It is no wonder that Mike Wallace has denounced the film in no uncertain terms as a libel and a fraud if there is indeed any truth to be found in his depiction herein.  Embodied by an unctuous Christopher Plummer, the character hardly qualifies as a pillar of moral courage and rectitude.  One of the frustrations in this type of film, anchored in such recent real life events involving contemporary figures of some public standing, is that we, in the audience are not privy to all the facts as they originally played out, and with the proviso offered that not all the events depicted in the film are true blue and factual, we don't always know just what to believe and what not to believe.In style, Mann employs heavy use of the handheld camera, which effectively creates a sense of journalistic immediacy and truth.   One glaring technical error does, however, stand out.  At one point, while two men are carrying on a telephone conversation, one in Kentucky and one in Mississippi, we can see clearly that, in one shot it is nightfall and in the other bright day. Unless one of those two states drastically changed time zones, someone in Mr. Mann's film crew obviously fell asleep at the switch.Although the film cannot always shake off the sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu created by its similarity to a number of whistle blower dramas from the past (\"Silkwood,\" \"The China Syndrome\" etc.), its no-pseudonyms-please topicality gives \"The Insider\" a power all its own.",

And really this film is a brilliantly poignant take on the lengths at which both sides will go (during a whistleblowing incident) to keep the truth hidden or revealed. The only thing I could have used a little bit more of is Wigand's reasoning behind why he should reveal to the world the truth behind this particular Tobacco. I got all the reasons and examples as to why he should keep his family safe (among many other things), but I feel like I didn't get enough from the movie as to why he should risk his life and come clean. Besides of course, the obvious reason being that it's the right thing to do. Other than that, The Insider is an impressive watch, and one that still rings relevant to this day.7.8/10",

            "content": "In 1976, Alan Pakula's All The President's Men was released.  Those were heady days for journalism.  In the period since , the enthusiasm over the Watergate investigation has waned considerably.  Then Woodard & Bernstein became stars and millionaires.  Today many newsmen are millionaires. People wonder if these guys still share their values. Walter Cronkite is no longer in the anchor chair. Viewers have fled the big Three for Cable.  The cable news networks define news coverage for all other national news outlets.  Cable News and syndicated tabloid magazine shows give fits to the news divisions at CBS, NBC and ABC, which produce newscasts that are less serious than ever in order to remain competitive.  And Americans are about to flee television itself, for the Internet.Against this backdrop director Michael Mann gives us The Insider, a film every bit the equal in seriousness to All the President's Men.  Russell Crowe plays Tobacco Executive Jeffrey Wigand.  Al Pacino is Sixty Minutes Producer Lowell Bergman. Wigand has just been fired from his $300,000 a year job.  Bergman wants help deciphering a tobacco industry document. The two of them start an uneasy relationship.  The film suggests Wigand's employer began spooking his family BEFORE the executive agreed to become a whistleblower for Sixty Minutes. I doubt that is true.Soon the two men are developing the story.  The Mississippi Attorney General's office wants Wigand to testify.  Reporter Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) is brought in to interview Wigand.  Executive Producer Don Hewit (Anthony Michael Hall) is brought on board.  Brown & Williamson gets wind of Wigand's betrayal. Bergman says it wasn't him who tipped B&W. Wigand begins a new job as a high school science teacher. Brown and Williamson assigns detectives to follow him and make trouble for Wigand's family.  The Tobacco giant plants anti-Wigand stories in other Press outlets in anticipation of the Sixty Minutes bombshell.  Wigand's wife and daughter leave him.  He loses his home and the wife divorces him.The story keeps developing and the pressure builds.  But the biggest problem is inside CBS itself.  CBS Legal learns that Wigand has a contract with Brown & Williamson that provides for serious financial penalties if Wigand reveals ANY of its secrets, and CBS is liable too.  All of a sudden the story is threatening the financial interests of the Network itself.  Wallace and Hewitt agree to back off. Bergman is livid. He says CBS owner-CEO Laurence Tisch is betraying the news division because he is afraid a major liability suit will queer plans he has to sell the network to Westinghouse.  Left out of the script is the news that the Tisch family owned Loews controls Lorillard, another of the seven giant tobacco companies in America.  Even director Michael Mann had to make some concessions.  He must have bargained away this embarassing little detail when making his own deal with CBS over what would appear in the script.Bergman has to tell Wigand the story has been squelched. After all he has had to put up with, Wigand is more than disappointed. Bergman begins leaking CBS' betrayal of the news division to other press outlets.  Wallace is now angry that his own part in the coverup has been revealed.  He and Bergman quarrel. The Producer is furloughed for a week by Hewitt.  But CBS News has a black eye that would make Edward R. Murrow roll over in his grave.  Wallace has a brilliant public relations ploy. Lets go over to Black Rock (CBS Corporate) and sell them a package that will save all  our reputations.  I won't tell you what the deal is though you can probably make a good guess.The film is two hours and 37 minutes long.  It doesn't drag but its a very long sit for a film audience that is mostly under 30 and more interested in special effects than public affairs.  In 1976 the film would have been hailed as something like the Second Coming.  Today, a film like this is released with almost no fanfare. Its only hope is to capture enough awards to alert the mostly 35 and older audience that has abandoned filmgoing, at least in theatres.  Two years ago, Crowe made a boffo debut in a wonderful film called LA Confidential that was soundly trounced at the Awards by the Carnivorous, youth-oriented Titanic.  And Crowe, whose performance is tempered in this role, is one of the greatest screen actors to hit these shores since Marlon Brando, James Dean, George C. Scott and Tony Hopkins.  Because he still insists on acting at a time when appearing in monster special effects packages is the key to success.., because of this, Crowe's success as a film actor is still not a cinch.There are other actors in this film that are wasted.  Any film that would use Rip Torn as little as this one does, deserves a slap.  Torn plays PR man John Scanlon, but he barely speaks a sentence.  British actor Michael Gambon plays a high executive at B&W.  His screentime is minimal.  And Mann repeats a video clip of Gambon repeatedly.  The guy who lit a welding torch to reshape the Otter's Uncle's Lincoln in Animal House 21 years ago is wonderful as one of the courtroom lawyers from Mississippi.  Wings Hauser, the aptly named and wonderfully over -the-top B-movie actor who usually is larger than Richard Simmons onscreen, is subdued here as a B&W lawyer at a Mississippi court hearing.  Speaking of subdued, the most interesting performance is Christopher Plummer's subtle underplaying of Mike Wallace.  Plummer's Wallace almost seems to be subordinate to producer Bergman.  I wonder if Wallace is really this quiet around his colleagues at the network. The Plummer portrayal is in savage contrast to the Mike Wallace we are used to on-air.  Plummer makes no attempt to imitate the on-air Wallace.  His delivery is sufficiently newsman-like, but it is not the hard-hitting TV character we are used to. Gina Gershon is sharp and sharklike playing the CBS Lawyer who deflates the team's hopes of putting the story on the air. And former New York Post Editor and columnist Pete Hamil plays a reporter-editor at the New York Times, one of the few Gotham publications he has not worked for.I wasn't crazy about this film, but in a debased American Cinema, the Insider stands out just because it is directed to an adult sensibility.  There are many adults who will not enjoy this film. Its been a long time since Watergate. Not everyone is interested anymore.",

            "content": "Many great actors fall into self-parody atone time or another. Brando did, Orson Welles did, and so has Al Pacino.  A frequent criticism I've heard of Pacino over the last ten years or so is \"now he yells all his dialogue\", which is the layman's way or saying just that- that Pacino is playing some facsimile of himself, leaning on some remnant of past glories. Yet when we see Pacino in a different role, somethng unexpected of him, as the PC mayor in City Hall or the sleazy near-Satanic attorney of Devil's Advocate, the audience doesn't quite accept him.  Of all the big actors, Pacino is the one most identified with a particular character, the crusader who fights the corrupt system- even if he's corrupt as well, as he was in the Godfather movies or Dog Day Afternoon.  He now plays nearly everything over-the-top, like a Frank Gorshin doing an Al Pacino imitation (Glengarry Glen Ross was the last hint of subtlety or pinpoint anger), which is why his performance in \"The Insider\" comes as a pleasant surprise, even if the face is tired and the features slung low, he gives enough combative vitality to hearken back to the old days.\n       The thing I found interesting here is the casting:  Russell Crowe, a man in his 30's playing a 50ish scientist and Pacino, a man of about 60 playing a 40 or so TV producer (even if he does look like he ought to be wearing glasses-on-a-chain).  This time the \"system\" is 60 Minutes, who has Pacino working on an expose of the tobacco industry, then after Pacino gets a top scientist (Crowe) to go on camera with damaging information that will ruin the scientist's family and work life, 60 Minutes honcho Don Hewitt, kowtowing to corporate interests, decides not to run the interview.  I'd like to think Hewitt and Mike Wallace in particular are not as bad as they come off here (Wallace is a brash egomaniac who ponders his legacy, his great gift to history and Hewitt so pragmatic and bottom-line-conscious he should be running a CPA firm).        The two lead performances are terrific: Crowe is superb as well as the true crusader that's in all of us; we want to be brave but with an eye toward the consequences.  Christopher Plummer's Mike Wallace imitation is downright hysterical, although I swear to God he sounded more and more like the real Wallace by the end.  The negative to the picture is Michael Mann's direction.  His snail pacing is ponderous and he tends to present events as though they're Grand Opera.  One scene where Crowe returns home to find his wife and kids have left him is so laughingly overscored, so superfluous in its indication of a great moment that it spoils the delicacy of the simple emotion.  Mann, who also directed Pacino's cracked performance in Heat, seems to think he is creating epics, when, in fact, a movie with a theme of journalism should have been made to meet a deadline.  I thought \"Shattered Glass\", another movie about journalism, was better crafted, more taut and concise.  But see this one for two great actors in their glory, one current and one remembered.  3*** out of 4",

To the censors, just because something was true didn't mean it would be approved;  on the contrary, the truer something was, the more dangerous it could have been as an instrument of sedition and insurrection.  What an irony, then, that 200 years after the ratification of the Bill of Rights, the tobacco companies have the power, and authority, to exercise `prior restraint' censorship on matters of fundamental and vital interest to the public welfare.  It's as if the tobacco industry has become the pre-Revolutionary equivalent of an oppressive board of censors.  I suspicion that it would have made Madison's blood boil.  Ain't that a corker?Not since All the President's Men has such a significant, insightful, beautifully presented and dramatically poignant documentary film \u0096 an embellished but basically true tragedy of epic Greek proportions \u0096 been released.  On the one side, you have Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), a producer for CBS's `60 Minutes,' whose mission is to communicate vital information to an informed, voting populace.  On the other, there is Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), a former tobacco executive, who faces a monumental moral dilemma:  on the one hand, he knows the dirty secrets of the tobacco industry, and deeply feels his duty to expose them;  on the other hand, he is bound by his confidentiality agreement with Brown and Williamson, which he also feels duty bound to honor.  Worse yet, Wigand faces an array of profoundly negative personal consequences if he decides to go public. Needless to say, no one would blame him if he decided to protect himself and keep quiet.  But to talk, well, that's as valorous a deed as ever accomplished on a field of battle.  This is a true `must see' video.",

He was fired from his position as the head of research and development, and as he gingerly begins to speak to Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), a spokesman from 60 Minutes, he begins receiving death threats aimed at himself and his family. Crowe delivers yet another outstanding performance, as does Al Pacino, who flawlessly creates the type of character that his role calls for. Not only is this a very interesting story, but it also gives a very good look at how big business corporations work, with both the massive cigarette companies as well as the respected television show, 60 Minutes, being presented in a new light. The casting was perfect for this film, everyone delivered excellent performances. The legal thriller is an almost endlessly interesting genre, but The Insider puts a new twist on the almost overdone subject, resulting in an excellent film that should not be missed.",

Overall, the movie has stuck with me ever since. Wigand isn't quite the saint the movie portrays him, and movie isn't completely factual, but, nevertheless, it remains one of my favorite films.

            "content": "Michael Mann is a director with an appetite for crime and detectives. This applies to TV (\"Starsky & Hutch\", \"Miami Vice\") bit also for the cinema (\"Heat\", 1995).It is therefore a little bit of a surprise that with \"The insider\" Mann makes a docudrama about the cigarette industry. This docudrama is however not about smoking being bad for your health (everybody knows that) but about the industry adding purposefully ingredients reinforcing the addicting effect of nicotine to their cigarettes. A scandal causing a huge dollar amount of claims.Main characters of the film are an investigative journalist (Lowell Bergman played by Al Pacino) and a whistle blower from the cigarette industry (Jeffrey Wigand played by Russell Crowe). Both are portrayed in a very realistic, not romanticized way.By investigative journalists we almost automatically think of Woodward (Robert Redford) and Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) in \"All the president's men\" (1976, Alan J. Pakula). However Lowell Bergman is not working in an idealistic environment like the Washington Post but in a media company with the emphasis on company that is afraid of diminishing advertisment revenues (from the cigarette industry).Also whistle blower Jeffrey Wigand is not only an idealist but also a man made of flesh and blood, doubting if the cause is worth offering a promising career. In \"All the president's men\" the whistle blower (deep throat) literally remained in the dark and never became an interesting person.In the end Jeffrey Wigand not only offered his career but also his marriage. There was some criticism that the movie was women unfriendly portraying Mrs Wigand in such a disloyal way. In my opinion films are women unfriendly when they portray a woman as a sexual object only but not as they portray a woman as less then perfect.More interesting in my opinion is the role the American way of health care insurancy is playing. Losing your job can also mean losing your insurance. When you, or one of your loved ones, has health issues, this can be a big problem. It is a big problem in \"The insider\", but also in films as Glengarry Glen Ross (1992, James Foley) and \"Take shelter\" (2011, Jeff Nichols).",

What Mann, Pacino and Crowe have done is give us some of the more kinetic scenes and performances in the past 20 years or so. Terrific stuff at times.I had a few problems with the Insider, mostly in that they try to cram in too much without enough time devoted to them.Gina Gershon and Debi Mazar resemble each other enough so that I hadda really pay attention to tell who was who, and what it was Debi's character did. She has hardly any lines despite being in many scenes. Diane Verona as the long suffering Wife of Wigand isn't really developed into a three dimensional character, and I agree-when she leaves Crowe, we don't feel it as much as we ought.Hall and Plummer also resemble one another enough so that I found myself thinking-THAT is Hewitt, THIS is Wallace, more than once.\nAnd there were a few scenes that did not fit-notably the 'FBI/Geologists in the restaurant' scene. I had no idea what 'arrest' they were talking about, or where this was in relation to the whole tobacco case until they wedged in the Unibomber stuff at the end. Maybe they coulda done without that entirely? I think so.But overall-the acting, the pacing, the feel for what these people went through, I found to be genuine, true, heartfelt, very well done. Crowe at times kept on looking like a guy who was my age(more or less) with white hair, but I still think he deserved an Oscar.Overall, a really goof film, and to my thinking, BETTER than American Beauty.***1/2 outta ****.",

Apparently this isn't supposed to be fair, especially since the CEOs of the 7 major companies all swore under oath that they didn't believe nicotine was addictive. This movie is about a scientist who worked for Brown and Williamson, the #3 tobacco company, who had knowledge that his CEO lied and therefore cast doubt on the veracity of the other 6 CEOs. So, in a nutshell, if they lied and knew their product was causing cancer deaths worldwide, they would therefore be liable and could be sued for billions of dollars. The movie centers on Al Pacino as \"60 Minutes\" segment producer Lowell Bergman, and glowering Russell Crowe as Jeffery Wigand, the scientist with a conscience, as they struggle to come to grips with the truth as it relates to the law and their ethics.

            "content": "I consider Mann to be the second most important living director in the US. I became his fan after I watched Violent Streets (released in the US as     ) way back in the Eighties at the Indian International Film Festival in New Delhi. I had then written in the newspaper I was then working for that this director is somebody to watch out for. I am glad that some 20 years later I have been proven right. I consider him next in importance only to Terrence Mallick among living US directors. It is a shame that those associated with American Academy of Motion Pictures constantly bypass great talent on so many occasions. Overlooking the performances in the Insider and bestowing so many awards for American Beauty is crass injustice. The Insider is superior to American Beauty in several respects, acting, direction, music, photography\u0085 At some stage in the Oscar history, this august body will realize that just as Orson Welles was ignored for his early work, great contributors to American cinema who are being ignored are Mann and Mallick. Both of them are consummate filmmakers: who take great care with story, screenplay, acting, editing, photography, sound and music. Mann, unlike Mallick, approaches less philosophical subjects and is therefore appreciated by a larger slice of the public. \nWhy do I find Insider not to be his best work? The Insider's power is essentially in the content. That it is the work of Michael Mann and cinematographer Spinotti only adds flavor to the product. Mann is a director who could make James Caan, an average actor, appear impressive in `Violent Streets'. If he could do that it is not surprising to find superb performances from Crowe and Pacino in `The Insider'. Compare this with `Heat', whose story needed the superb treatment of Mann and Spinotti to come alive. In `The Insider,' the focus is understandably on the male duo and due to the documentary nature of the subject the women are pushed into the background. In `Heat', while the male duo carry the film, the female characters are not wallflowers\u0096all three wives/lovers grab your attention. Mann had a `compleat' film in `Heat'. That does not mean `The Insider' was not a great work-it had limitations to develop due to the subject.\nAnother great trademark of Mann is his opening sequences full of kinetic energy injected through sight and sound. However, the opening shots of `The Insider' reminded you of a Costa Gavras/Gillo Pontecorvo type of Sixties cinema, much less impressive than the powerful opening sequences of `Violent Streets' and `The Last of the Mohicans.'   Mann, Mallick, and Kubrick are directors who use sound and music with great felicity. In `The Insider' the scene of Wygand refusing to be disturbed in the hotel room is an example of this talent in Mann, with beautiful music, camerawork and special effects.Has Mann matured over the years? Definitely. Mann directing `The Insider' is more reflective and offers the viewer options to evaluate Wygand and other characters, which `Heat' did not. You begin to like Wygand as he makes the big decision as he stares out at the waterscape. You begin to doubt, as he cannot defend aspect s of his past. You begin to wonder if Wygand is using circumstances to be hero or if he is a true hero as he hits the golf balls in apparent solitude. In `Heat' there was no such ambiguity. His work is much better in `The Insider' than in `Violent Streets'. Yet `Heat' is in my opinion a more demanding and creative work compared to `The Insider'.",

Another main character, here performed by always impeccable Al Pacino, is a hot-tempered CBS journalist, who is not afraid either of some mighty Lebanese Mullah or not less mighty tobacco moguls. He also goes on and he wins. The happy end here is not a false, sugary sweet melodrama type of end. Nay, since the whole plot is based on a real story, the director Mike Mann made it as it was. Yes, the happy ending, but after so much sufferings and losses. What is good, the movie does not thrive on blood or violence. What is a bit rude and even shocking, all the heroes use too much of the F-word.

            "content": "Or the Ronnie Reagan of the left. I mean this in both the positive sense that he is a cultural hero, and in the negative sense that he is a celluloid hero. I have seen so many Al Pacino movies that I feel not only that I know him, but that he is actually a character from my own life. I like him here as Lowell Bergman, a radical ex-Ramparts Magazine editor grown into middle age but still fighting the good fight from within the establishment of CBS and 60 Minutes. His hair still flies about, showing that he is a free soul who cares more about substance than appearance. (We realize that the dye job is a necessary concession to the media world in which he lives.) And the passion still burns bright in his dark eyes, and he's still as wiry as a teenager.But is this history? Is this the truth about what happened with Jeffrey Wigand, big tobacco and CBS? Or this 'revisionist history' dressed up dramatically to make the good guys look good and the bad guys look bad? I wish I could say this is how big time journalism really works, and that we have been afforded a true view inside the system. But it's hard to tell where the truth leaves off and dramatic license takes over. We learned in journalism long ago that there is no real objectivity; that all is to some extent interpretive. In fact I recall a college text we used in the sixties with the (then) arresting title, 'Interpretive Journalism.' Today's text might be called 'Subjective Journalism' and tomorrow's 'The Age of Tabloid Journalism.'Nonetheless, this is a very good movie. The script by Michael Mann and Eric Roth sparkles with the immediacy of today's headlines, and Mann's direction is clean, crisp and dramatically very sharp. Russell Crowe as Wigand, the biochemist who blew the whistle on big tobacco and lost his wife and children to divorce in the process, is excellent. His subtle and restrained interpretation of Wigand reminds me so much of those guys from my generation who opted for the security of the corporate structure, only in his case the misgivings got to him. Diane Venova is chilling in a small role as his wife, a house and home centered woman who leaves him because she doesn't think it's fair to subject her and the children to the dangers and financial uncertainties of his whistle-blowing activities. Wigand is the reluctant hero and she is the woman who did not stand by her man.Christopher Plummer does a good job of playing 60 Minutes's Mike Wallace, who gets plenty of egg on his face here. He looks pathetic in the scene where he talks about what he will be remembered for. I'm sure Wallace is mad as hell about the portrayal, but I don't think anybody is going to sue the producers of this movie, since it is so popular and so much in tune with what most of us believe to be true. Gina Gershon appears briefly as a greedy bottom line lawyer who cares nothing about journalism or the ethics of journalism.John Wayne fought the enemies of our culture on celluloid with true grit and an unwavering, if sometimes moronic, sense of what's right. Al Pacino does the same here, except our enemies have changed and what's right isn't so clear anymore and the war room has become the board room. The really melancholy thing is I guess I wanted to believe in John Wayne when I was a kid, and now as a middle aged man, I want to believe in Al Pacino and 60 Minutes. This movie helps.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

His daughter suffers from severe asthma that could be deadly without immediate care, and soon he comes home to an empty house. He's soon threatened and accused by Big Tobacco, until a reporter for CBS News wants to interview Jeff and blow the whistle on television.It's not the smoking or the \"evil corporation\" concept that's disturbing, what really was sad to watch was how quickly Jeff was alienated from his family for \"blowing the whistle\". Of course, The Insider isn't the first movie following this type of plot: Silkwood (1983), Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal (1982) and A Civil Action (1997) all follow similar paths.

            "content": "\"Insider\" was a lot better than I expected, much more thoughtful and absorbing than the schlock thriller suggested by the trailer. At two hours 40 minutes it's far too long for a thriller and we could have done without the trip to Lebanon to see the head of the Hezbollah, but we do get an intelligent analysis of whistleblowing.Whistleblowing is full of pitfalls, and internal whistleblowers tend to get it in the neck. Jeffrey Wigand, former Brown & Williamson head of R & D, here at least survives with his integrity intact, though he loses his family. To the press he is a person - until the next story comes along. America's \"free\" press is generally thought of as being pretty fearless, but this story (largely true, it is claimed) shows a media giant, CBS, being stopped in its tracks by a legal side wind. As if \"tortious interference with contractual relations\" could stand in the face of the First Amendment after the US v Nixon. The alternative explanation - worries about the effect of a lawsuit on the value of executive stock options - was much more plausible.The disclosure itself really came as no surprise - that B & W, a big tobacco company, retained a proven harmful ingredient in cigarettes to keep customers addicted. It also came as no surprise that all the tobacco company CEOs perjured themselves before a congressional committee when they swore that they did not believe nicotine was addictive. In fact the only real reason for trying to shut Wigand up was as an awful example to other insiders who might be contemplating similar moral outrage.Russell Crowe, aged suitably, portrays Wigand as very focused but rather emotional man who has difficulty in both expressing and dealing with his feelings. Strangely enough his true metier turns out to be teaching. Al Pacino as the investigative TV journalist Lowell Bergman is a much more straightforward piece of acting. Bergman is not very susceptible to self-doubt - the faults he rails against are in the news institution he serves. Christopher Plummer plays the \"60\" Minutes anchorman Mike Wallace as somewhat of an egomaniac (you can see why the real Mike Wallace didn't like the portrayal) who, more used to getting his own way, was allegedly rather more prepared to bend to his corporate masters than Bergman was,.At the end, the fictional Mike Wallace redeems both himself and CBS. Some of the minor characters are beautifully done also, such as Michael Gambon as the sinister southern gentleman B & W CEO and Gina Gershon as the super smooth CBS in-house counsel whose iron-clad poise Bergman manages to disrupt.It's interesting to compare the \"wives\" in the story. Mrs Wigand is the traditional supportive housewife, and she crumbles under the strain (which is considerable, death threats, bullets in the letterbox, financial stringency and worries about two small chidren). Bergman's partner, admittedly not under quite the same pressure, with her own job and perspective, acts as a useful sounding board for Lowell. It seems if you want to have a really supportive partner you should have someone with a bit of emotional independence.Big tobacco certainly has a lot of clout but it has since been brought to an accounting of sorts with the US$250 billion settlement in the States' lawsuit (which has a role in the movie). What I find truly amazing about the US political system, though, is the way quite minor lobbies can paralyse government action, for example relations with Cuba. For the sake of two or three congressional seats in the Miami area the US government keeps Cuba in the deep freeze, to the long-term detriment of both countries.On journalism, it was nice to be reassured that those who do their work properly get the better stories. The New York Times was happy just to print Bergman's leaks to it on arguments within CBS about airing the Wigand story. The Wall Street Journal (ficticiously prompted by Bergman) got a much better story when it checked out the 500 page dossier on Wigand prepared and distributed by his ex-employer and found that much of it was false.",

But what is almost an abomination is the work done by Michael Mann.  Sometimes a film has such strength in it's script that it can survive on that alone.  Think of work by Tarantino or Kevin Smith.  They usually have material that is strong enough that you don't need a lot of camera work or an infinite number of camera movements to capture the essence of a scene. The Insider is directed like a it is made by a guy that is fresh out of film school and wants to use every technique he ever learned and that means using 25 different angles for one scene in a room.  The Insider has more close-ups and over the shoulder two shots that I can recall any movie having in quite some time.  And that became boring and cumbersome after about 15 minutes.  Whatever point was trying to be made had been done in overdrive. Close up of Crowe and his kids= he loves his kids and their life and safefy is at stake.  Close up of Crowe= he is in imminent danger.  Close up of Crowe and his wife= they are in danger and they are on shaky ground.  Close up of Pacino=  I don't know what, it could mean anything, maybe Mann is obsessed with close ups of actors.  But they were not needed in this film. I got tired of them, I didn't need to see every pore on Pacino's face, every wrinkle on Crowes forehead, every hurt expression on Crowe's wifes face magnified twenty times.  Movies have directors so that they have direction but that does not mean that I need or want to know that they are there behind the screen and off to the right of what is happening on screen.  I've always thought that a film works better when the presence of a director is not felt.  When you can look at a screen and feel like you are peering into someone else's conversation, then that is the best kind of film making. Spielberg is a master of it, Tarantino and Smith are as well and even a guy like Robert Zemekis is wonderful at doing that.  But Michael Mann seems as though he is unsure of himself as a director of films that are laden with dialogue so he compensates his ineptitude by using every shot he possibly can.  This is the biggest problem with the film, but it is not the only problem.  As interesting as the film is, in subject matter that is, it is really quite boring and slow.  There were many times that I groaned silently and wanted the film to end.  But it just kept going.  And I also felt that as good as Pacino was, he wasn't allowed to act, he was always just waiting in the background to do or say something.  The times when he was allowed to show emotion were the best parts of the film.  There is a scene in the office of 60 Minutes when Pacino is allowed to explode after his character has been told that his story is not going to air.  Here he blows and tells them how foolish they are and how much of a corporate puppet they have become and I will bet good money that when Pacino is nominated for an Oscar, when they show the clip that showcases his talents for the Oscar at the ceremony, it will be this piece that they show.  He really excells for about five minutes in this one scene.  But that's all there is, really.  The rest of the film he just sort of waits in the shadows to do anything memorable.  I don't know how you make a film like this better, with the subject matter and all, but I know one way to do it is to let Pacino loose and another way would be to get a better director.  I mean let's face it, no matter how good your subject matter is, if it is something that you can make into an A&E Special, perhaps it shouldn't be on the big screen for 150 mintues.  Overall this is an unsatisfying movie and one that I don't really think redeems itself.  I had seen Dogma the day before this, and as I stood in line, freezing on a blistery Saturday afternoon in Toronto, waiting for the Pokemon kids to get their tickets in front of me for their beloved film, I commented to the cashier that I was probably the only one seeing something else besides Pokemon.  He told me that I was probably right, except Dogma was selling out as well.  I wish I had gone to see that again.  It too was quite long ( about 2 hours in length ) but it was funny and enjoyable along with being interesting.  The Insider and Michael Mann should take lessons from Dogma and Kevin Smith.",

            "review_title": "Compelling Drama From Michael Mann",
            "content": "Many times, the resolution to a problematic situation is seemingly as easy as simply knowing right from wrong, and acting upon it.  The sub-text of the problem, however, is often more complex; especially when the onerous decision of personal sacrifice is involved.  Such is the situation explored in `The Insider,' a powerful drama directed by Michael Mann and starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe.  Based on the true story of Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe), a former Corporate Vice President of one of the major tobacco companies, it examines his struggle to act in accordance with his own conscience after circumstances put him together with Lowell Bergman (Pacino), a producer for Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) and the highly respected television news program, `60 Minutes.'  On the surface, Wigand's conundrum seems easily dispelled; as a research scientist involved with matters of health, he has vital information concerning the addictive nature of nicotine and, moreover, the attempt by the company for which he worked to enhance the consumers propensity for it by manipulating the ingredients of their product.  Under oath (and televised on C-SPAN), the CEO's of the seven major tobacco corporations testified, to a man, that to their knowledge nicotine was not addictive; but Wigand knows otherwise.  And by claiming ignorance of the properties of nicotine, they subverted the truth even more by refuting what Wigand knew to be what they considered their real business: The delivery of nicotine to the consumer.  You put a cigarette in your mouth, you light it up, you get your fix.  Bottom line, not only do they know exactly what they're doing, they perjured themselves on national television when questioned about it.  Wigand's problem, however, is the confidentiality agreement he signed upon termination of his employment; if he talks, he loses the lucrative severance package that includes health benefits for his family.  And he has a young daughter with acute asthma.  So from his perspective, in knowing the truth about `Big Tobacco,' the question becomes one of morality:  How much does he owe, and to whom, considering the personal sacrifices he will make if he does the right thing. \tBeginning with an intelligent and well developed screenplay (by Mann and Eric Roth, adapted from the magazine article `The Man Who Knew Too Much,' by Marie Brenner), Mann meticulously presents this story of ordinary people under the stress of extraordinary circumstances in a manner that is creatively imaginative and totally engrossing; in short, a flawless delivery of a terrific script and story.  The tension begins from the moment we are introduced to Wigand and continues to build throughout the film.  There is inspired camera work (at times almost invasive, in a way that puts the viewer `in' the scene), impeccable transitions and pacing, and Mann exacts a number of brilliant performances from his actors, especially Crowe and Pacino. \tCrowe gives a detailed, Oscar worthy performance (he was nominated) as Wigand, deftly capturing the traits and attitude of this intelligent, complex individual; his volatile temperament and demanding attempt at self restraint, his forthright manner and love for his family, and the toll that coping with the demons that plague his conscience takes upon him.  Crowe has a compelling screen presence that commands the viewers attention; his expressive reactions alone convey intelligence, a sense that the `wheels are always turning,' that demands regard.  It is quite simply a remarkable character study delivered by an amazingly gifted actor whose approach to characterization is, in many ways, reminiscent of the style of Alec Guinness. \tPacino gives a commanding performance as well; the kind of work we've come to expect from one of our greatest actors, who time and again never ceases to amaze with what he can do.  As with Crowe, his turn here is firmly planted in reality, and it's that ability to make it so real that gives such emotional impact to the drama.  And it should have garnered him a Best Actor nod as well. \tOther notable performances include Christopher Plummer, who absolutely `becomes' Mike Wallace, affecting a manner of speech and physical traits that are entirely convincing, and Diane Venora, as Wigand's wife, Liane. Also, in smaller-- but highly effective-- roles, are Michael Gambon (Thomas Sandefur) and especially Bruce McGill (Ron Motley), whose work here should have brought him a Best Supporting Actor nomination.  In the final analysis, `The Insider' is a film that will keep you enthralled from beginning to end; one that rings of truth beyond reproach and which aptly demonstrates how important it is to have men of principle and integrity among us.  This film is an example of cinema at it's best, and one that demands viewing by one and all.  I rate this one 10/10.",

The human cost of revealing \"the truth\" is graphically illustrated in this brilliant movie, which is superb in every way. The main tenets in this film are true and begs the question how on earth can these drug traffickers(disquised as executives)not only get away with but prosper in their deliberate deceit and intent to harm and kill us all?? The film also importantly shows how these criminals attempt to censure the media from telling the truth. I am one of the millions of victims of cigarette addiction and this film makes it obvious to me that the scale of legalised drug trafficking in this film makes the perpetrators far worse than the Nazi's ever were.That begs the question however why do Governments allow the sale of cigarettes?? My own research knowledge reveals that from now to the year 2025 the equivalent of a shipload of Titanic passengers will die every 7 minutes from the effects of cigarette smoking.

            "content": "After his last masterpiece, HEAT, Michael Mann had enough integrity and credibility to attack the powers that be. So with this film he crosses the hot coals - lit by the drug pushing tobacco companies, multi-billion dollar corporations and the TV media - to tell the true story of Jeffrey Wigand who blows the whistle on his ex-employees about the drug induced nicotine they mass produce. 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman gets a whiff of the story and is quick on the trail. He is a man of his word that gets straight to the point and doesn't like to mess about. He may seem to be too patriotic, waving the sleazy media flag but he is not. You can label him as the last of the true media reporting heroes, a rare thing in this day and age. The other bonus Bergman has is that Pacino does a wonderful job in portraying him. You almost wonder why all the accolades are going to Crowe as the poor stressed-out Wigand. Not taking anything away from Crowe, the man is absolutely astonishing. As a viewer you do get swept into his deep ocean of paranoia and frustration. With these two performances up front there is no letting you down. What really picks up the film is the second half when all guns are out to do battle with the revelations of what goes on behind closed doors in the Corporate sector. The great thing is that there are no shoot-outs or dead bodies for dramatic effect. Reality can sometimes be fascinating! Mann's previous films were stylised, but with The Insider he knew that the script was good enough to stand on its own. So he went for the realist look where the photography of Dante Spinotti is just there to tell the story without any fancy lighting. Another technic Mann uses is the sense of paranoia. We get into Wigand's fear as the image lingers on at the end of a scene with the extras in the background becoming the focus of attention. Is one of them the tobacco thugs, spy or whatever? Or is it just me that's paranoid? This build up works perfectly for Pacino's character later in the piece when he realises what Wigand is going through. Nice to see a film not afraid to tell who the real criminals are, because these days we all just tend to shut up, bend over and take that Corporate $ firmly between the cheeks!",

The main thing is Brown and Williamson in Louisville, Kentucky were adding amonia to the tobacco to make it more addictive. Wigand worked for B&W in research and knew this. He told Bergman, Pacino, and how Bergman got the story told is the film. Mann writes with a multi layered approach. I enjoy that in his films and liken it to a symphony.

Money rules and morals are cast aside in corporate American. Silence about the truth is gained through intimidation, pay-offs, and the simple psychology of fear.The musical score is very effective -- an operatic elegy depicting the struggle for truth against titanic odds. Integrity eventually survives, but at great costs. The cast is excellent. Pacino is especially good at underplaying his seething desire for journalistic ideals. He and Crowe stand almost alone against the forces brought against them.The film also has some interesting symbolic foreshadowings. Watch for the sign \"Beat the Clock\" signifying that truth is in a race against time. Notice how the main character's daughter has lung problems, indicating an unstated reason why Crowe's character is so determined in his fight for the truth.

With troubled Wigand leaning hard on producer Lowell Bergman (Pacino), they risk arrest for contempt of court. Now the two of them has to struggle hard against Big Tobacco's attempt to silence them and CBS' network cowardly pulling out, wanting to avoid a lawsuit.The story is brilliantly told through the different aspects of place & time, Crowe's Wigand does a sterling performance as the stolid character he portrays goes through a struggling marriage whilst he's attacked by B&W and feels manipulated by Bergman. Al Pacino is the movie's powerhouse as the former 60ties radical who's operating together with star correspondent Mike Wallace, played by a priceless Christopher Plummer. Pacino's in prime-form from the opening scene in which his appearance finds him sitting hooded in the back of a car, cruising in the crowded streets of any Iranian city to the final finish in which he leaves the 60-Minutes behind, stepping out of his lifelong workplace.And it's that fore-mentioned opening scene that's one of the movie's most fascinating moments; Bergman deals out an exclusive interview with a sheik, later Wallace steps in to do the actual interview when he's strictly order to move away from the sheik. Wallace gets up from his chair, and out-manages the armed soldier with \"Do you think I'm an 78-year old assassin who's gonna kill him with my notes?\", there's tension in the room as Bergman steps in and asks his companion Wallace if he's \"through fu**ing around?\". And when the interview starts Wallace asks \"Do you know that everyone in America thinks you're a terrorist?\" - it's a killer scene and stays with you through the whole movie. It's showcasing of great television, it's a startling interview by the very first question, and 60-Minutes becomes a great show because it tells the truth- but with Wigand and Bergman's case about tobacco, 60-Minutes and CBS executives won't air the original interview, they're gonna need a sanitized, alternate version of it. Now Bergman rages at Wallace for going along with 60-Minutes head-chief Hewitt, and there-by Wigand rages at Bergman for feeling left out and manipulated, he didn't count on pressures that would break his marriage and death threats. And Wigand is a isolated hero who's kept quiet about for years about Big Tobacco, how he acts like a ticking bomb as his frustration and anger boils over as the purring B&W boss threats him if he doesn't agree on a further and tougher confidentiality pact.This is 2 hours and 30-something minutes of talking, about how truth gets compromised in the America. As Bergman says; he gets the interview, he makes him break his confidentiality pact, he tells the truth, he shoots it but are they gonna air it? No. Wallace backs at at the age of 78, wanting to be remembered for that the last thing he did wasn't to tear down CBS to pieces, loosing his job and respect. Bergman on the other hand is as Hewitt calls him an anarchist; standing at the beach talking with Wigand on the phone he realizes that the system's not there to back him up anymore, he's taken this case too far for anybody in CBS to back him up, he's on his own - and when his wife says \"You won\", he can't feel reluctant to ask what did he win. CBS finally agrees to air the original interview, as Wallace walks over to him and asks about their next project together - Bergman looks at him and says \"What got broken here doesn't go back together again\". This is Micheal Mann at his best, a provoking drama that's one of the best movies the 90ties ever made.",

It simply does not work.Here's my breakdown:STORY:\nMany whistle-blower stories have been told and made into feature film e.g. \"All the Presidents Men\" (1976),\nbut you need meat in the story and not just great acting. The latter film is superb, but not because Hoffman\nand Redford were gifted actors, no, but because they also had an excellent story to work from.Note: I'll say a bit more in Director and Writer comments, but Michael Mann is not a good storyteller, and this\nhas his \"mark\" of story-suffocation all over it.ACTING:\nAs written above, the acting is fine.ENTERTAINMENT:\nLow - moderate depending on standardsTEMPO:\nSlowCINEMATOGRAPHY:\nThis is Mann's strength, he does excellent camera workMUSIC / SOUND:\nAs I've said in other reviews, incessant music to create non-existent drama dilutes a story's tension, and is\ninvariably a signal that the story is lacking.DIRECTING / WRITING:\nDirector: Mann is a very capable director, but here again he takes on writing and producing roles ... rarely does\nthis work. When it does work consistently it's because the director is also a gifted writer, e.g. Steven Spielberg,\nand a small cadre of others. Mann has directed and written successfully before, \"Heat\" (1995), but that was an\nanomaly. Too much of his TV pedigree comes through, and TV-style-writing kills good story.Writers: This was Roth's first story for film, and if she was the primary writer, then that may explain the poor\nquality of the story. But my bet is that Mann exercised too much control, and quashed her work. Dunno.Is it a good film? Borderline, but I would not call it \"good\"Should you watch this once? No, too many similar films that are far betterRating: 6.0 (good camera work)",

            "content": "This is a dramatic triumph; a gripping story of the battle between truth and corruption in the sacred halls of mass media news.  Based on the true story of Jeffrey Wigand, the research scientist from Brown and Williamson Tobacco who blows the whistle on the industry's attempts to chemically enhance the addictive effects of nicotine, this story grabs you like an anaconda and slowly squeezes you until you are out of breath.The plot follows Lowell Bergman, a producer for 60 Minutes, as he first stumbles across Wigand (Russell Crowe), convinces him to do an interview and then battles to get the interview aired after Brown and Williamson threatens CBS with a lawsuit.  This is reality based drama at its finest.  For once, we have a real story that is not rendered dubious by over-dramatization.Michael Mann directs his third consecutive triumph.  He only does one project every three or four years, but what he lacks in frequency he more than delivers in quality.  I liked all aspects of his direction, but I was particularly impressed with his use of the camera.  Mann has all the various camera techniques honed to perfection, but what is most impressive is his appropriateness in using technique in a scene to maximize effect.  If he gives us an extreme close-up or a foreground blur, it is exactly what is needed for maximum impact in the scene.  He uses technique to enhance the scene rather than using the scene as an excuse to show off technique, a disease that seems to have become epidemic, especially among hip young directors.Mann brings us taut drama with a relevant message.  He provides well defined characters that hook the audience emotionally.   His pace is always appropriate with moments of frenetic action augmented by dramatic buildup and suspense.The acting in this film was uniformly excellent.  Pacino is at his finest in this role.  It is clear that he had a real passion for the part unlike his stilted and phony performance in `The Devil's Advocate'.  As in `Heat', I believe that Mann has again brought forth Pacino's maximum dynamism and squeezed out of him every bit of his brilliance.Russell Crowe elevated his game to a new level with this film.  Though I found his performance a bit uneven, he brought great power to the role (perhaps a bit too much), and transcended his previous best performance in `LA Confidential' by a wide margin.   This was a complex and difficult character,  reserved and intellectual yet highly emotional and explosive. This is a combination that doesn't usually come in the same package.  Crowe nailed the reserved intellectual part, but was overwrought in the angry scenes, coming across more like an action hero than the incensed nerd he was supposed to be playing.  However, this is a picayune criticism of what was on the whole a fabulous performance.This is one of the better dramas I have seen in a while.  I rated it a 9/10. It is well written, well acted and well directed.  What more can you ask?",

The Pacino/Crowe/Plummer trio is pretty fine, and the rest of the cast carry out their duties adequately.However, mostly due to the complex nature of the film's subject matter a lot of the would-be impact message gets lost on the way: tobacco kills; cigarettes can cause all kinds of cancer \u0096 but this is mostly due to all kinds of chemicals added to the nicotine by the cigarette manufacturers. The original cigarette, as found among South American Indians and brought back to Europe were as harmless as hashish, precisely because in both cases the product was purely natural.An interesting film quite intelligently put together. Unfortunately I began smoking when there were no warnings like `cigarettes are harmful to your health' nor any other kind of anti-tobacco social feeling. Excuse me while I put out my cigarette.Now, where was I? Oh, yes: I've just been a couple of months in the dear old U.K. for the first time in 22 years. What a surprise! I could not smoke almost anywhere without asking permission first! The same, even harder, was in Australia two years ago \u0096 even in caf\u00e9s I had to ask permission to smoke.

I liked the story (even though as one \"hated it\" fan says, it's old news.) I liked much of the acting -- with particular praise to Michael Gambon for his near perfect accent and slimy affect, and to Russell Crowe for his understated but dead on portrayal of Wigand. Some of Pacino's work did seem stacatto, blustery. Two aspects of this movie, as a film, were quite disappointing to me. It needed an editor. There were several segments that were pointlessly drawn out, the director's \"little darlings\" I think, that were not quite sleep-inducing to me, but just irritating. The movie could have been far better at 2 hours. The other problem was the music. It was, for the most part, either pointless and irrelevant, or just awful and overpoweringly distracting. The awful part consisted of a rather abstract vocal composition that should never have been 6 miles from a microphone, ever!

Plus, in tune with the culture in Massachusetts, USA, where smoking was banned in workplaces earlier than most regions, I was looking forward to enjoying \"The Insider\", which sticks it to the evil cigarette industry.However, \"The Insider\" is based on a true story, which means that the script writers are not at liberty to spice up the plot. They can't, for example, throw in an extra car chase whenever they like.So the film sort-of bored me. The acting by can't-fail actors Al Pacino and Russell Crowe was great, but this wasn't \"The Firm\", and lives weren't really at stake here. Without giving away the plot, mostly it's a legal battle where Al Pacino (the journalist) has to convince Russell Crowe (the Insider) to endanger his career.OK, he might endanger his career. So what? That's worth a movie? That's bravery? I know, I know, the film is really about Pacino's character as the protagonist, not Crowe's, but it still didn't work for me and I found it a little boring.Who should see this film:-- Arty film types, you'll probably appreciate more than I did-- Anti-smoking types who can't help themselves-- Action / thriller movie buffs, but only on a rainy daywhen you've got nothing better to do, and only if you don'tneed stuff to blow up constantly to enjoy a filmI give \"The Insider\" a disappointing 5 out of 10.

He eventually succeeded in changing the public's perceptions of the effects of smoking. Although the public may have been quite aware of those effects already. Crowe looks a bit like Wigand, and Plummer looks quite like Wallace. Pacino, who played the persuader, Lowell Bergman, a reporter, doesn't look like him. It seems that Crowe spent a lot of time with Wigand so that he could imitate him in the film. Bergman has said that the film was emotionally, politically and, in general, dead-on accurate. He terminally fell out with Wallace.Wallace is said to have hated this portrayal of him. But the force of corporate power is a given. Not many are as resolute as, say, Thomas More. It's an extremely unusual man who stands up to corporate pressure.However, the question I was left asking myself was: How addictive is nicotine, and: is it the nicotine which harms the body, or is it the smoke of the tobacco leaves ? I used to be a fairly heavy smoker \u2013 30 or 35 cigarettes a day; but gave up on 16 November 2010 and have only smoked about 15 cigarettes since, after finding them lying around the house.

Designer eyewear shimmers on the faces of middle-aged men with an aleatory glint; neckties and restaurant furnishings are given solicitous, almost autistic attention.

It would be nice to say that Mann does the Best Work of His Career in this account of a tobacco-industry whistle blower's crucifixion at the hands of CBS News, but it's probably more accurate to say that he has his least knuckleheaded material in the solid-B-average, HBO-movieish script by Eric Roth. Russell Crowe gives a magnificent performance as the doughy would-be \"man of science\" attacked with a crisis of conscience, and Al Pacino is his blustery recent-usual self as the \"60 Minutes\" producer who fights the good fight to put him on the air. The movie stays compelling even at two hours and forty minutes--much of it devoted to Mann's fascination with scenes played in silence, except for New Age ululating. Mann doesn't know when to cut any more, but who cares--does anybody else know how to light neckties like this guy?

After she storms off, Jeffrey whom admittedly has a bit of a drinking problem, quietly stands up and marches over to the bar. Remaining at the table, the show's host Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) gleefully stares across at his producer, Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) and asks with a grin on his face \"Who are these people?\" Lowell's answer perfectly describes what Michael Mann's visceral, subtle thriller is all about. In one sentence, he summarizes the entire plot and in that shows the genius of how Michael Mann could take something so minimal and make it so extraordinary. Lowell quickly answers \"Ordinary people under extraordinary pressure, Mike.\" The Insider focuses primarily on Jeffrey and Lowell, two characters who start in very different places and collide to eventually make drastic changes in each other's lives and the fate of our nation as a whole and it's stand on the tobacco industry. The film opens with Lowell in Israel, blindfolded being taken to a meeting with a reported terrorist whom he convinces to conduct an interview with Mike Wallace for the show. Across the globe in Louisville, Kentucky we are introduced to Jeffrey Wigand as he's walking away from his office for the last time after being fired for what his employer called \"communication problems\" but he knows that it was because he was no longer comfortable with what they were doing; lying to the public in order to get them to continue to buy their products while being completely unaware of the consequences. He watched the Seven Dwarfs (the seven CEOs of Big Tobacco) lie under oath, saying that nicotine wasn't addictive, and he was no longer comfortable with it so they let him go and made him sign a confidentiality agreement not to disclose any knowledge he gained while working for Brown & Williamson. Jeffrey had every intention to go home, find a new job and honor this agreement with no exception.As is generally the case with Mann, he quickly (but thoroughly) introduces us to the main characters without wasting half of the running time just to give us the basic background of the characters like the majority of films inevitably do. Mann has a gift for showing us one scene for each main character (in this case, the two leading men) that allows us to understand their entire personality and leaves the vast majority of screen time for the actual story to present itself instead of spending so much time on introducing the characters that the story is left to be bunched together in a flimsy package in the last half hour. After the strong introductions to the characters, we see a typical morning for Lowell Bergman. On the phone every second with his wife answering the other calls, he barely says goodbye to his two children as the eldest informs him that there's a package on the porch for him. When he finally gets around to opening this anonymous delivery and realizes that he's going to need a consultant in order to translate the documents into words he can understand. Through a network of communications, he's connected with Jeffrey Wigand who agrees to help him but refuses to do anything that would breach his confidentiality agreement.That is, until Brown & Williamson make a grave mistake. After hearing that Jeffrey has spoken with Lowell, they bring him back in and ask him to sign another agreement that \"more thoroughly defines what confidential is\". After some poorly chosen words by the company's CEO Thomas Sandefur (Michael Gambon), Wigand becomes infuriated and gets the impression that the company is threatening not only his life but also the life of his family. He doesn't sign the paper, storms out of the office and immediately calls Lowell, thus embarking them on the journey that will vastly change both of their lives. Wigand goes through an emotional roller-coaster in order to do what he knows is the right thing by exposing Big Tobacco for the frauds that they are. His family is threatened and eventually leaves him, his paranoia reaches several breaking points and his life is ultimately destroyed by his decision to come forward; through all of this, he still firmly believes that it's worth it. He becomes a martyr in order to expose the lies of Big Tobacco, and Lowell guides him through this crusade. Through Lowell we are given an inside look into the new industry and we see very raised emotions that explode, Network-esquire, including one particularly stunning scene where Mike Wallace scolds \"corporate lackey\" Helen Caperelli (Gina Gershon) for cutting the guts out of a controversial statement he made.Just like Network, The Insider's sensational story of corruption and the web of the media is hinged on numerous brilliant performances. Russell Crowe gives possibly the finest performance of the entire decade. His subtle portrayal of Wigand's paranoia and indecisiveness is stunning, but what's even more brilliant is the actor's ability to display all of the bottled up rage and fear that Wigand had bound up inside of him. The few scenes where these emotions explode are some of the most emotionally draining experiences I've ever witnessed on film. Though Crowe is definitely the shining point of the acting ensemble, the rest of the cast also excels (primarily Al Pacino, Christopher Plummer and Diane Venora). Mann's direction is truly ingenious, as it always is. His style is beautifully unique and smooth and he manages to create a visceral, highly engaging film unlike any I've ever seen. In the end, The Insider is an impeccable character study of \"ordinary people under extraordinary pressure\".",

Michael Mann is responsible for my favorite movie of all time, \"Heat\", and there are some similarities in the \"poetic visual language\" that he has mastered fully.The performances are amazing, both Crowe and Pacino are immersed in their characters and make them so real and alive that one hardly thinks of them as actors in a movie.But what really makes this film excellent is the filming. It is beautiful, alive and vibrant. The images convey the sadness, fear, frustration and anger that the leads are experiencing. Fantastic. I can't wait for Mann's next masterpiece.By the way, the music one hears when Wigand discovers the agents in and around the house (that later reveals themselves as his bodyguards), and rushes towards his house is music from \"Heat\". In that movie, it is played when Shiherlis (Kilmer) drives away from his wife, presumably forever.",

I love how Mann plays out the scenes to give you the feeling he's looking for. It's Pacino's best performance since Scent of a Woman, and Russell Crowe is terrific. Christopher Plummer (from 'A Beautiful Mind') was the perfect man to play Mike Wallace. This is a story about truth, integrity, and the politics of the business world. The ending almost makes you cry. It's a fight for truth. A masterfully told story, excellent camera work, one of the best scripts in a long time, and Lisa Gerrard's score is perfect (remember her from 'Gladiator'?). You can see Michael Mann pays attention to even the smallest details to set the right mood. I can't think of anything I would change in this film - it should have won best picture. This would easily make my top five, and is a must see.",

The whole time, he looked like he was going to have a nervous breakdown. The tremendous pressure that he was put under. \"Do I tell?\" \"Do I keep my mouth shut?\". It is a double edged sword. He deserves an Oscar nomination. Al & Michael Mann always pull off a great production when they work together (just watch Heat, you'll agree with me). And to everyone who did not like this: do yourself a favor and don't see movies with involved character stories, because it is impossible to not think of this movie as one of the best of the year (next to American Beauty). If you dont like movies with controversy and character studies, this is not for you. My mother and I loved it and we are recommending it to all our friends.

            "content": "`The Insider' has been compared in many ways to `All The President's men', released in 1976. While I found both movies to be brilliant, I don't find them to be similar in any way. While `All the President's Men' was a factual, claustrophobic look at the uncovering of the Watergate scandal, `The Insider' is much more subjective and at times, a bit more compelling. Anyway, `The Insider' is an outstanding and continually fascinating look at this story that occurred not so many years ago. It's not very often that I can say this and mean it, but this is one of the few movies that is engaging for it's entirety, and at 158 minutes, that's quite an achievement. It's just a shame that the movie didn't receive international success it deserved. I wasn't very impressed with `Heat' (Michael Mann's last outing) so wasn't sure if this would be any good. Where I found `Heat' to be boring, `The Insider' was simply mesmerising. The flashy, shady directory techniques are magnificent and though this is a lot less murky and subtle than `All the President's Men' was, it still creates the desired effect. Backing up the excellent direction is outstanding acting from the lead actors.\nThe best performance comes from Russell Crowe in the first of his three nominations (Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind soon followed). His portrayal of Jeffrey Wigand is first rate and he proves he can lose the machismo for these quieter but very powerful roles. He definitely should have won the Oscar that year. Al Pacino does his familiar `grumpy determined' part but he's never done it with as much substance and pure gusto as he does it here. `Mr. Von Trapp'- Christopher Plummer, does his part quite well as the head of the network. Diane Venora plays her `good wife' part adequately but there isn't much material she has to work with. There's a big (if not un-necessary) supporting cast with average performances from the likes of Philip Baker Hall, Gina Gershon, Lindsay Crouse, Michael Gambon and Debi Mazar. What most surprises me is the fact that the movie was nominated for 8 Oscars and didn't win a single one. It definitely deserved to win Best Picture ahead of the pretentious, contrived and manipulative `American Beauty', let alone Best Actor and Best Director. `The Insider' is a brilliant and muchly under-rated account of the uncovering of the truth about the addictions of nicotine. It's just a shame that it didn't receive the huge audience it deserved. Definitely a film that deserves a reserved spot in the IMDb Top 100. My IMDb rating: 8.5/10.",

Very well written and with a great cast \"Lowell Bergman\" Al Pacino (The Godfather, Looking for Richard) is a great character. I remember something about the incident. Russell Crowe (Gladiator, Proof of Life) is a very good actor. The man he plays  \"Jeffrey Wigand \" is very smart, has a lot of knowledge about the cigarette industry, and who was willing to come forward to tell that the cigarette industry was in privy that cigarettes are addicting. Well, not to put the character down, but I believe that everybody knows that.  The entire world knows that... Why don't they do something about it, you've guessed it money!  Why they decide to destroy the life of  Wigand is beyond me because the whole world knows to be true what he was going to say anyway. But they destroyed him, and the movie is about how he was followed, stalked, terrorized. and so on. When I was young I also believed in changing the status quo, but after having gone through severe trials because I am outspoken I have learned to keep my mouth shut. Is it good, that I have learned that? Not sure! But for some reason sometimes even describing the obvious in the world is an  impossible thing to do. Why? I don't know. This is an excellent movie which I recommend. My favorite scene: Is a conversation where Lowell Bergman states: \"You'd better look into it, because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious.\" Favorite Quotes: Jeffrey Wigand: \"I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials.\" Lowell Bergman: \"To a network, probably, we're all  commodities. To me? You are not a commodity.

In a twist of fate he comes in contact with Lowel Bergman - a producer with 60 Minutes - who asks for his help decipher some documents.  Circumstances and a moral barometer convince Wigand that he must divulge his secrets.  Only after baring his soul does Wigand truly learn how much he really has to lose. At two hours and forty minutes this is a long movie with some notable lulls (are there enough cell phone conversations going on?) that should have been left on the cutting room floor.  In addition, Michael Gambon was particularly ineffective as the villain in the piece - he is annoying and distracting rather than menacing.  So much for the bad. \nWonderful cinematography and a good script are outdone only by the performances.:  Crowe does a remarkable job as Wigand (he gained almost 40 pounds for the role) alternating between paranoia and rapture and you realize that he never understood the scope of his decision.  Pacino hums with intensity as the man-of -his-word that coaxes the story out of Wigand, only to watch his promises destroyed.  Finally, Christopher Plummer's take on Mike Wallace as a paragon of journalistic integrity who caves to his corporate masters is anything but flattering, (hence Wallace's attempts to stop this film from being made).  It doesn't get much better than this.The showpiece of the film is the depth of the conspiracy and total arrogance displayed by the tobacco companies.  As Wallace notes, Wigand's information doesn't merely say that \"cigarettes are bad for you\":  he paints them as  dealers designing and pushing the ultimate in addictive drugs, and god help anyone that gets in their way.   We are talking the ugliest of the ugly.If you're a smoker who is tired of warnings on cigarette packages maybe this will give you pause the next time you light up.

Yet, the center of the story is the risks and trouble it takes for one to expose the truth. The first David is Jeffrey Wigand (Rusell Crowe), a former tobacco scientist who was fired for \"poor communication skills.\" But Jeffrey was really fired for questioning his bosses at the tobacco company about putting a addictive chemical into cigarettes to increase sales.  It isn't until Jeffrey's and his family's life are threaten that he wants to go to the press and expose the truth. Enter the second David, \"60 MINUTES\" producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino).  Lowell thinks that this could be the biggest story of the decade.  And Lowell and his friend/reporter Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) to run a cover story on what Jeffrey has to say.  But airing a story this big, won't be easy. Now comes the first Goliath, the CBS executives and attorney's.  They feel that airing this story will cause a major lawsuit on CBS, and destroy the business deal of Westinghouse's purchase of the network.  And if Westinghouse doesn't buy CBS, the executives will lose a lot of money. The other Goliath is the big tobacco company.  If Jeffrey testify against his former employer's his health benefits will be taken away, and Jeffrey needs it since one of his daughters suffers from asthma. This is quite a story, and Michael Mann does a brilliant job of bringing it to the screen.  Mann has done a excellent job in the past of showing true to life crime stories: THIEF& MANHUNTER.  A violent, yet historical adaptation of THE LAST OF THE MOHICIANS.  And his biggest and best work yet about a Los Angeles epic crime story, HEAT.  THE INSIDER isn't as good as HEAT, but it does come pretty darn close.  It's the kind of film that goes by quicker and it's more enjoyable every time you watch it.     The acting is top notch as well.  There's a strong supporting cast including: Christopher Plummer, Phillip Baker Hall, Michael Gambon, Diane Verona, Lindsay Crouse, Debbi Mazar, and Bruce McGill.  But the two leads, Pacino and Crowe, definitly stand out for their acting.  Pacino does a excellent job as the network producer who is suffering from trying to get the truth exposed, but is being pushed back from doing that. And Crowe is also excellent as the informer who is looking over his shoulder as he's fearing for his life. What's also great about this film is the excellent cinematography by Dante Spinotti.  Spinotti has done a great job in the past with HEAT and L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, but in THE INSIDER, he displays his best work yet!  Some of the scenes just need to be seen to see how great of a job Spinotti does. And the music score is also wonderful.  It really adds to the suspense and tension that this story brings. That is why I LOVED, THE INSIDER so much.  There is so much to love about it.  Like many other films that try to make a point with it's story, THE INSIDER does it so well.  And Michael Mann not only does it well, but with style.  I will be very disappointed if this film, the actors, and cinematographer don't get recognized in Febuary for the Oscars.  This film well deserves it!  A outstanding, not to be missed classic! ***** (out of five)",

However, the trailers advertised what looked like an action film, so I passed on it and forgot about it.  However, the Academy Award nominations recently came up, and \"The Insider\" was nominated for Best Picture.  I don't think it or any other film will win against \"American Beauty\"(which I have not yet seen, but will), but nonetheless, you can't resist seeing a good quality film.  To my luck, it was re-released and now seems to be making more money than it did when it first premiered.  I saw it, and was absolutely amazed at what a good film it was.First of all, \"The Insider\" is based on a true story, and it stays very true to the actual accounts, with the exceptions of some dramatic additions which were stated at the end of the film.  It was very realistic and the actors didn't look like they were acting, even though they do an excellent job of doing so.  They looked like real people, who talk to each other in a normal manner, unlike the cliched Hollywood dramas with the characters overacting and giving lines that only work in movies.  I also liked how the characters were handled.  Al Pacino as the journalist is laid back, yet determined and true to his word and never intends harm to anyone.  He cares about his subjects, and he wants to help them.  Russell Crowe as the doctor is great, because he's not some gung-ho hero who has a wife that looks like a centerfold on Playboy magazine and sarcastic one-liners.  He is a real, living, breathing family man whose wife cares for him, yet is unable to deal with the problems his \"inside\" knowledge of the drug industry causes.  The movie dances beautifully back and forth from these characters.  Both are equal in importance, and both are given a great amount of care by the director.  Michael Mann makes absolute sure that you know who these people are, and what they are feeling. I also loved the camerawork, because it was never overdone.  People complain that it got out of focus at times, but that only added to the realism and artistic qualities of the film.  As a matter of fact, what makes this film so great is how everything, even the music, was underplayed.  Overdoing something for dramatic effect is silly, but is often done to \"please\" the audience and wake them up.  Here, you can't help but be riveted because it's just so damn real!\"The Insider\" tells the story of a man, or an \"insider\"(Russell Crowe) who knows secrets about the cigarette and drug industry, but is afraid to talk. He is approached by the journalist(Al Pacino) and is offered to do an interview regarding the subject.  He agrees.  Threats are made to him by the drug industry, and death threats are made to his home.  He blames the journalist, but the journalist says he only wants to help and has nothing to do with the events and threats that are happening.  The \"insider\" goes for broke and does the interview, and then testifies before a court, after he is warned that if all does not go well, he could go to prison. \nThen the film goes from being a riveting case of what it took to get the truth out of the \"insider\", and turns into a poignant study of how the power and manipulation of the media can take a normal family man, and destroy his life.  The \"insider's\" wife files for divorce and takes the kids away.  CBS is afraid to air the story on 60 minutes because they might be sued and lose money, and their ownership of CBS.  The \"insider\" moves out and lives in an apartment, in seclusion.  There is a brief moment when Michael Mann uses a digital effect to morph his room into the backyard of his home and he sees his two daughters digging in the garden.  The result is one of the most saddening images of the film, in which we see this man, this family man, lose everything he worked so hard for and loved, merely because he told the truth to the media and the court.  \"The Insider\" is definitely one of the year's very best films, and it's a shame that it didn't receive as much attention as it did when it first premiered.  Like I said, I doubt it will win Best Picture, but that doesn't detract from the overall quality and art of this film.  If you want to see a great film that turns it's back on Hollywood dramas and a fascinating true story, then look no further.  \"The Insider\" is it!",

            "content": "How this movie, the best film of 1999, got a grand total of 0 oscars will remain a mystery for a long time.First, the movie takes a story about an overweight whistle blower with family issues and melds it with tobacco & the world of deception, cancer, medical hu-do, and lawyers.  It does this and is watchable and interesting.Second, the acting is superb.  Crowe went all out preparing and doing the role and Pacino portrays his aspect very well.Three, Mann is the Jack of all trades.  He makes a short story/article into a nicely flowing and very long movie.  The tough subject matter (above) is intriging full of suspense (despite the fact that we know the general ending from the true history).  He then produces a good ad campaign (the poster is a classic pun of a cigarrete package. Finally, as director the entire package comes together.Despite the nominations and despite the performances, the film did not find a huge audience and it was the only one of the 1999 best-picture nominees not to gain massive revenue from its nomination.Possible reasons for this are that the film is really long (155 minutes) and the subject matter is complex.  Given this, long attention spans and an interested audience are needed.  Also, Mann may still have the TV type stigma from his Miami Vice Days (although he has since been connected to many other quality movies).  Maybe it was the writing, as it  was on a true event stigma (and therefore less work because an outline is theoretically established).  Perhaps, Crowe (being a relatively unknown) hurt awards. Another possibility is maybe people thought Mann hollywoodized history (like Hurricane and U-571); although I cannot see it.In the end, it did not separate itself from American Beauty as Best picture. While the two had differing audiences and vastly different material, both films were great stories with nice writing and good acting.Either way, The Insider is a great movie that should not be missed.  It is long, but every minute is important to the story.  It did not win a single oscar, but it was good enough to win all that it was nominated for.",

            "content": "I didn't know what to expect of \"The Insider\". The first time I heard about it I didn't care much. Then, I saw one scene at a TV programme and I thought it was a conventional film as \"A Civil Action\". But, in December, it received some nominations to the Golden Globe, including best picture and, even not winning anyone, I started to show some interest about it. About fifteen days ago, the nominees for the Oscar were announced and I knew that \"The Insider\" could be a strong rival for \"American Beauty\" -my new favorite film-, so it had to be almost as good as the other one. Well... I watched it this afternoon, and... if it's not better than \"American Beauty\", or as good as that, it is a high level film which has its importance.Everything in \"The Insider\" has a high level, from the acting to the screenplay. Director Michael Mann, whose previous works were \"The Last of the Mohicans\" and \"Heat\", does a wonderful job with the camera and is helped by a very well written screenplay, based on a true story, which makes suspense about ordinary things and keeps the attention of the audience. If Kevin Spacey weren't on the list for best actor nominees, my favorite one would be Russell Crowe. He was great in \"LA Confidential\" and here he perfectly plays a man in contradiction, who has to make an important decision and has to deal with the consequences. Al Pacino delivers a stellar performance once more, and Christopher Plummer should have been remembered by the Academy. The film has its flaws (the fact that it is slow, for instance), but this defects are covered by its great qualities.\"The Insider\" is a very important movie for some reasons. It is about the power of the media in the '90s and how it can manipulate people. But, more than anything, it is a film about ethics, and how ordinary people deal with it. Russell Crowe's character, Jeffrey Wigand, is on a very difficult situation, and the film shows very well how he faces it. That's one of the greatest points of this picture.I gave \"The Insider\" a 9 out of 10 for all its qualities and great points, showing a sad true story very, very well. But if you want PERFECTION, pure perfection, go watch \"American Beauty\", which is for sure my favorite for best picture.",

Director Michael Mann's tyrannical perfectionism has once again paid off and created a fascinating, complex and extremely well-rounded narrative that is helped further along by excellent editing and a first-rate script (which Mann co-wrote with Academy Award-winner Eric Roth) that never descends into character stereotypes or mawkish dialogue. Russell Crowe pretty much steals the show as Wigand, a moral man caught in extremely immoral circumstances who risks losing everything for the sake of telling the truth, much to his wife's (Diane Venora) continued misery.

Not that anyone would have realized that the tobacco industry was just trying to make people addicted to nicotine in order to sell more of their product without watching this hard-hitting docudrama expose.  And in case you don't get this message in the first fifteen minutes of the film, Mann goes to great detail to drum it into you in every other scene.  For example, we are shown--over and over and over-- the scene where Jeff Wigand (played so constipatedly by Russell Crowe) is being interviewed by Mike Wallace on 60 Minutes while a camera softly pans the other characters' faces again and again as they poignantly watch the interview.  I guess this is supposed to be like, a collective realization for all of us that yes, corporate America is evil and we, innocent the American citizens and liberal media have been duped by this evil force.  Yes, Michael, I understand.  Big tobacco = bad. Liberal media and American citizens = good victims.  Deep.  Very, very deep, Michael Mann.  And I really dug the way Mann used the handheld camera for 3/4ths of the film, making some scenes so jumpy that I was wondering if the characters had nervous ticks or were jumping up and down for the camera.  It was just like, so realistic and raw.  And I really enjoyed the post-1960s Baby Boomer guilt of Al Pacino's character, Lowell Bergman.  It's like, \"Yes, I am a Yuppie who has a mulimillion dollar job, house, and life in New York city, but I relieve my 1960s liberal guilt by saying Herbert Marcuse was my mentor and proclaiming myself a 'liberal journalist.'\"  Wow.  I guess that makes everything OK.  And then there was Al Pacino's screaming like 50% of his lines in the film.  That really brought out the \"meaningfulness\" of the whole \"liberal media fighting evil corporate America\" theme.  And I just liked the way most of the characters were really unempathic to one another's nurturing needs, especially during the moments when they needed to cry or be held.  It's always great to see Hollywood churn out another damaging image-fest where there's lots of yelling, advice giving, and abandonment when characters need to listen to one another.  It really excites me when these images are held up for the whole world to see (especially when the images proclaim themselves to be examples of \"real life\" behavior, as in this flick) so kids and adults alike can imitate them and unconsciously internalize the oligarchical/patriarchal power structures which they represent.  There were a few nice moments in the soundtrack--the opera piece stands out for me here--but overall, that ended up coming across as pretentious as well.  I am definitely not in tune with the \"Academy.\"  I can't believe this film was nominated for 9 awards.",

As for Crowe- this guy is right up there with Daniel Day-Lewis right now in terms of his range and conviction.  In going from L.A. Confidential to The Insider and then Gladiator, Crowe shows a huge range of acting ability.  The supporting cast does their job wonderfully, especially Plummer as Mike Wallace.  However, the biggest star of the film, after Crowe and Pacino, is the cinematography.     Dante Spinotti captured America's natural grandeur and sensual beauty in Last of the Mohicans.  Here, he likewise effortlessly brings us into claustrophobic, numb, and disorienting realms of suburban and corporate America- (I'm no longer sure Conrad Hall deserved best cinematographer at the Oscars.)  The music is an odd choice, filling a story of American greed, corruption, and crumbling ideals with what sounds like tribal and spiritual music from the East.  But it ultimately works! What I most like about the Insider is that it refuses to dumb down its script, images, or characters.  Mann respects the minds of his audience, unlike Alan Ball's script for American Beauty.

Based on a true-life magazine article, The Insider follows the contrasting fortunes of Jeffery Wigand and Lowell Bergman, two men driven by different incentives, yet both compelled into achieving the same result: to reveal to the American public the shocking truth that will result in the biggest public reform issue the nation has ever seen. Having been unfairly fired, Wigand, a former research scientist at tobacco giants Brown & Williamson, is prepared to go on national television and reveal the facts behind the company's part in 'impact boosting', a chemical process designed to artificially increase the addictiveness of nicotine. Bergman, a producer at CBS' '60 Minutes', one of the country's most popular prime-time current affairs shows, feels it is his programme's moral duty to air what Wigand has to say, claiming it is the public's right to know. However, after agreeing to go ahead with the interview, Wigand comes up against several moral and legal dilemmas. By spilling the secrets he knows, he will be breaking a still-binding confidentiality agreement he signed with Brown & Williamson. They in turn have made it clear that by going public, Wigand will be placing the lives of his family in jeopardy, while at the same time risking a lengthy prison sentence for himself. Making constant use of stark close-ups and jittery, anxious camerawork, The Insider succeeds on several levels. As a drama, Mann's film is both engaging and compelling, with his deliberate, urgent directing invariably drawing the viewer into the heart of the scenes, almost placing them at the centre of the arguments in the boardrooms and courtrooms on screen. Mann has always been a visual stylist, but here he restrains from many of his familiar trademarks, opting instead for many long, hand-held, often amateur-looking takes. But if we look beyond any technical concerns, his chosen style of shooting only adds to the claustrophobic nature of the characters' situations, giving the entire film a documentary-like feel. He allows his camera, and therefore the viewer, to intrude upon, rather than merely record, scenes that often seemed improvised as a result. The performances from the leads only add to the impression that we are witnessing a real drama rather than a movie. As Wigand, the Oscar-nominated Russell Crowe is outstanding, giving his character a nervous vulnerability, while carefully avoiding the cliches of the helpless victim. He also manages to characterise the growing frustration and anger Wigand feels at being trapped and threatened into silence by forces more powerful than he'll ever be. The audience can only sympathise with his plight. While, as the determined and ethical Bergman, Al Pacino is his usual forthright self, wading through a legal and moral minefield to achieve what he believes is right, while berating anyone who stands in the way of him keeping his promise of giving Wigand a public platform from which he could blow his whistle. A film laden with both cinematic and dramatic substance, The Insider proves to be a very rewarding experience for those prepared to endure its two-and-a-half hours running time. Along with co-writer Eric Roth, Michael Mann has crafted a memorable, intense, and great-looking movie, one which is made all the more satisfying by his focusing upon the characters rather than the increasingly complex legal wranglings. Instead of allowing his film to drown under the weight of corporate red tape and boardroom-level corruption, he is sure never to stray too far away from the human centre of his drama, always careful to remind the audience that the characters on screen are as real and as flawed as they",

Events do not move the story along here as much as characters do.  Characters'internal conflicts, doubts, fears, and uncertainties are what drives and raises this film above the usual fare.It's Mann's novelisitc approach to the story that makes it such a refreshing change of pace.  He avoids almost all thriller cliches: there is no excessive profanity, no shootouts, no fistfights, no murders.  The result is a mesmerizing, totally involving, refreshing, and frighteningly realistic film.Russel Crowe's subtle, brooding, and humanistic portrayal of Dr. Wigand and the loss and forced change of his life and family bring a deep emotion to the film.  Wigand falling down a hill in his yard is one of the film's most unsettling scenes.  The rest of the ensemble cast also does well, but Crowe's haunting performance overshadows even veteran Al Pacino.Definitely not a conventional, over-the-top thriller, Mann's character tour-de-force is a welcome change to a genre that usually makes the viewer suspend belief.  \"Insider\" does not ask the viewer to believe the incredible; instead it makes the viewer understand the truth.9 out of 10",

            "content": "This film is unavoidably being compared to director Alan J. Pakula's \"All The President's Men\" and for good reason, because Michael Mann's new film is every bit as good. (Anybody is the TV news biz -like me- knows that newspaper and TV news are very different animals.) \"The Insider\" is a very mature film. It takes its sweet time letting the events unfold. However Mann and his team use very cinematic trick in the book to hold our attention and the editing is impeccable. But first and foremost the film features 2 virtuoso performances: one by a master we've grown accustomed to and one by a guy who may have joined his league. Of course I'm talking about Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. Pacino adds another mammoth blast in his Hall of Fame collection of home run performances. His portrayal of 60 Minutes producer gives him a lot of room to use all his skills as an actor and he never ever looks like an actor acting. He vents anger and frustration better than any actor I've ever seen and he is given the chance to do so here. Now on to the \"new\" guy. Anybody who has seen Russell Crowe before (especially in his Oscar-worthy effort in \"L.A. Confidential\") is not surprised that he can more than hold his own against Pacino, but then again acting is not a sporting event and there is room for a lot of winners in a movie like this. Crowe's role as \"the guy\" who blows the whistle on the tobacco industry is a fascinating study of a man imploding. Not since Pacino's work in \"The Godfather II\" have I've seen it done so well. Like every other thing Mann has done the supporting actors are great too, but the standout here is Christopher Plummer's Mike Wallace who has to reluctantly sell out to the corporate bottom line. The story about a guy who wants to go public about a major public health crime but is abandoned by a major network is complex and difficult stuff, but Mann and co-scripter Eric Roth do a magnificent job at keeping it clear and interesting. It is riveting and important entertainment. Like the phrase \"TV journalism\", \"important entertainment\" may seem like a contradiction of terms, but not with this movie which is one the best films of the year.",

Russell Crowe gives a fantastic performance that not only should be remembered at Oscar time, but should guarantee that he will become one of the top actors in the future. Al Pacino is very good (as usual) as Lowell Bergman, the renegade producer who fights with CBS and Wigand in order to save Wigand's story.  Christopher Plummer mimics Mike Wallace perfectly, and the rest of the cast are all good.  But most of all, it is Michael Mann's direction that makes this film work.  It moves at a frenetic pace, and pushes the audience to feel the tension and frustration of the story.

Visually, like all Mann films, it was experimental and breathtaking and the mood music perfectly complemented the colors and compositions of all the scenes. This film is also historically important for obvious reasons, and I felt that a biographical film like this is not usually given the thriller-drama that this film was given to such a quality degree, but Michael Mann never disappoints.

A row of cars drive almost solemnly as in a cortege toward a courthouse where a deposition will be given. Another vehicle twists through the streets of a Middle Eastern city with a destination rife with danger. These are just three of the images Michael Mann presents us with in his latest film, `The Insiders'. It's this constant parade of resonant scenes  that transform what could have been a run-of-the-mill TV movie of the week into one of most incisive and burning dramas to come from a major studio since `All the President's Men'.The actors portray a cast of real-life  people, never imitating, but subtly communicating their innermost feelings and conflicts. Al Pacino is Lowell Berman, segment producer of 60 Minutes, preparing an interview with Jeffrey Wigand, recently fired executive of the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co. Pacino has his best role in years. Here there is none of the scenery chewing he has been somewhat guilty of in `Devil's Advocate' and `Scarface'. This stunning expose of the tobacco industry will rock the lives of Wigand and his family, and change the public's view of Big Tobacco forever. Russell Crowe (as Wigand) delivers another award worthy performance as he tortures himself as to whether or not he should reveal the stunning facts he has been privy to as part of his job. Crowe actually gained weight to realistically resemble Wigand.  Christopher Plummer is perfect as Mike Wallace in a not altogether pleasant portrayal of this TV icon. Plummer is sure to garner  supporting actor nominations for this role. Description of the plot cannot do justice to Mann's passionate rendering of this story. He has delivered a motion picture for adults without the violence, car chases and explosions we are used to. And yet, the undercurrent of danger remains lurking around every corner threatening the lives of the people who just want to do what is right.",

            "content": ". . . this would be just another movie. The uniformly strong acting, the tautly-scripted storyline, the assured but (for the most part) largely unobtrusive direction - this stuff should just be par for the course. Back in the mid-70s these kind of smart, densely plotted, clearly focused movies were done all the time. Sadly, in today's Hollywood of Michael Bay, Lucas/Spielberg clones and Tarantino wanna-bes - where shock and spectacle, pop culture hipsterism, and visual overkill predominate - an intelligent, sensitively wrought movie like The Insider comes across like some kind of revelation. Rather than what it is: a good, competent film - not a transcendent one, nothing that will stay with you for a long time after you've seen it: in short, not a Best Picture nominee. And yet, of all the films up for the Oscar this year, I'd say this one is the best; what does THAT tell you about the movie cycle we're currently going through?I don't mean any of this to take away from the movie itself. There's much to like here, particularly the lead performances from Al Pacino and Russel Crowe. Crowe brings a crimped, repressed intensity to his role as Jeffrey Wigand, who blew the whistle on big tobacco and then had to live with the consequences. His stillness and meek stolidity simultaneously pull you in and yet keep you distanced at the same time. He internalizes the role to such an extent that we can sense the springs and whirrings going on underneath without him having to show any of it to us. As a matter of fact, it's very much the type of controlled intensity which Al Pacino brought to his work in such 70s films as Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon and (especially) the two Godfathers. Alas, it's a skill that has long deserted him (or been deserted by him) and he has become one of the most \"showy\" of actors. No Pacino performance can properly be called subtle anymore - it's merely a question of the degree his over-acting takes: either full-steam-ahead scenery chewing (Scent of a Woman, Dick Tracy, Devil's Advocate, Heat) or a more relaxed hamminess which at least keeps him on the same earthly plane as his co-stars (Carlito's Way, Glengary Glen Ross, Donnie Brasco). Happily, The Insider falls into the latter category, and his portrayal of \"60 Minutes\" producer Lowell Bergman, while certainly heroic and larger than life, is also imbued with a real sense of friendliness and compassion. In dealing with Wigand, he is forced to adopt several different roles - friend, confessor, sounding-board, even big brother - in order to nudge the man into telling his story. Pacino goes through the changes with ease, but he also suggests a real concern and protectiveness for Wigand which go beyond his need to get a good story. As such, the film becomes primarily about the relationship forged between these two men. This is a good way to focus the story, since it puts a human face on the larger issues raised instead of just being a simple-minded polemic, whose characters exist only to move the plot along.What else. Um, let's see - the direction is solid, for the most part; it lets the story tell itself rather than trying to inject much bogus \"style\" onto it (there are some lapses here and there - some overly dramatic soundtrack choices and a misplaced \"hallucination\" scene in a hotel room - but nothing too major). The supporting cast is all good - though certainly no more than that. This is particularly true of Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace, who's drawing all sorts of accolade for what is basically an impersonation. An enjoyable one, to be sure, but it never really goes beyond the surface. Of course, the film doesn't help matters by writing Wallace as a shallow dupe and corporate lackey - it really does a hatchet job on him and I'm not sure how justified it is. The final third of the film, in fact, is a little hard to take - the part which deals with \"60 Minutes\" refusal to air the tobacco story. It just doesn't seem as compelling as the earlier part of the film - partly because Wigand, the most interesting character, gets pushed to the background and it becomes a one-man show for Al Pacino. And when I say one man, I really mean it: the Bergman character is portrayed as the only one with any integrity whatsoever, as he single-handedly (and single-mindedly) pushes to get the story out through other media, while his colleagues (including Wallace) are content to tow the corporate line. The filmmakers exaggerate the facts here, and the film suffers as a result: it puffs itself up too self-consciously as an \"issues\" movie, rather than letting those issues emerge organically through the kind of character study the first part did so well. And any time a film makes one character the sole repository of goodness and integrity, as it does with Pacino here, it tends to become strained and unbelievable. So, too, does The Insider in the final half hour.Up until then, however, it's good - though certainly not the second coming of All the President's Men (the film it's most often been compared to). There's no reason, though, why every film shouldn't be this good; there's nothing amazing going on here, just an interesting story, well told. If that's the kind of virtue which gets lauded in Hollywood these days as a masterpiece, then I think we're all in a lot of trouble.",

The first Russell Crowe film I saw, was \"Romper Stomper\" Then, another Australian film: \"The Sum of Us\" Two totally different roles, both of which he handled with aplomb.Next thing I know, he's acting alongside Kevin Spacey in \"L.A. Confidential\", which, I thought was his best role to date. Then along came:\"The Insider\" Pacino is good, as always. Christopher Plummer is brilliant as Mike Wallace (he even looks like him), but Russell Crowe outshines them all. He looks and acts the part of a man on the edge. He has a well paid job. A good life style (on the surface, at least). He also is deeply unhappy about the business ethics (tobacco companies have ethics?) of his superiors, and he's prepared to put all that on the line; to blow the whistle. Jeffrey Wigand was a very courageous man, and it's a tribute to Russell Crowe's acting that you think it's Wigand himself, up on the screen. A few quibbles: The film was a little too 'preachy' read: 'heavy-handed', when dealing with the evils of cigarette smoking - the scene where the 'seven dwarfs' are testifying before a Congressional (Senate?) Committee, needed only to be shown once, in my opinion. That aside, 'The Insider' is a powerful film, and Michael Mann, a very underrated director - it's been a long time between \"Heat\", and this, and before 'Heat'? 'The Keep', or was it 'Thief'?",

Priding itself on its no-holds barred coverage of current events that really matter, its team of ace reporters have have blazed a trail for other news programs and have been successful in making people sweat.  Now, finally, along comes a film that puts 60 Minutes in the hot seat.  It's their turn to answer some tough questions.The Insider is a true story about the tobacco industry, and in particular one man, Jeffrey Wigand, (Russell Crowe) a recently sacked VP for a tobacco company who goes to 60 Minutes to disclose some shocking information.  Al Pacino is Lowell Bergman, a producer for the top rated show and would love to get Wigand on the air.To date the tobacco companies have refused to admit that cigarette smoking is dangerous, and lawsuit after lawsuit has failed to convict them.  Wigand has information that could change all that.  Bergman convinces Wigand to come forward, despite the negative impact it will and does have on his family, his safety and his life in general.  The 60 Minutes team stands behind him through thick and thin, only until they too begin to feel the heat.  When CBS finds good reason to back away from the story (by this time Wigand's neck is already on the chopping block) they pull away.You can feel a certain sense of danger throughout this film and while watching it I kept fearing the worst.  We don't see much of the big bosses at the cigarette companies, but we know they are lurking and we know they are a force to be reckoned with.  Wigand is a complicated character and Russell Crowe plays him brilliantly. We know this man did not come forward, simply because he feels a moral obligation.  In fact his anger over their treatment of him incites him more so than his sense of duty.  Pacino's Bergman, on the other hand, is the last surviving member of the club for honorable journalism.  He still believes in protecting his source, and will go to the wall, even when his own team won't stand behind him. Pacino gets in some great lines in this film that are somewhat reminiscent of All the Presidents Men.  We might have thought that Mike Wallace was the last honorable journalist, but this film proves us wrong.  Here we see a man that is arrogant and pompous, as temperamental as a Hollywood diva.  I would not have pictured Christopher Plummer in this role, but he handles it well.  Even though Plummer looks nothing like the real man, we sometimes forget that this isn't Mr Wallace on screen. Michael Mann has a powerful film on his hands.  Nicely told, this film takes on the role that perhaps the original 60 Minutes segment should have.  Here is a no-holds barred smack in the face to those powerful tobacco companies, and worse still, a stern reprimand for a program that has continually held its nose up at all other news shows.  The Insider is not an anti-smoking campaign.  I think it would have been too easy to squeeze in a few shots of people dying of cancer, but that isn't the purpose of this film.  The Insider takes us into the corrupt world of corporate politics.  Furthermore, it reminds 60 Minutes that it is the grandfather of tabloid television.",

A particularly brilliant opener follows the two main characters in their lives with Pacino's Bergman trying to prevent an already heated argument between a well known terrorist and Mike Wallace (a well done Christopher Plummer) and Wigand leaving his job. Another powerful scene takes place in a Mississippi courtroom where a lawyer truthfully tears into another lawyer and lets him have it.

Well, I must say, I was basically blown away by how much effort went into this film, and it is very recommendable.Based on a magazine article, The Insider follows the true story of Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), head of a tobacco company's Research And Development department, who discovers that the fag companies have for years not only known that nicotine was addictive, but worse, they've been messing around with the formula to make it even more so. After being persuaded to give a TV interview by producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino Pacino), Wigand discovers that smoking is deeply bad for your health, even if you've never lit a gasper in your life. Harassment, death-threats, a possible prison sentence and a collapsed marriage are a few of the ordeals that Wigand is put through -all, it would appear, to no avail when squabbling at CBS' 60 Minutes news programme leads them to ditch the programme, much to Bergman's horror.Some powerhouse performances here, Al Pacino is corker as Bergman, but New Zealander Russell Crowe pulls off the most impressive act in the film, therefore earning himself an Oscar nomination. Michael Mann, director of Heat, has assured direction here, he knows what he's doing, and he does it well, his script for The Insider is also well thought-out and amazingly clever. The only faults there may be here is the fact that The Insider could be a big bore for some audiences, but for me, it was an enthralling experience.A well done film, definitely worth your time.I rate The Insider 8 out of 10.",

Al Pacino acting up several storms?My advice -- having now seen it twice -- is to view this one while it's still in the theater.  This is the sort of intelligent, gripping movie Hollywood produces when it's at its best.  Like QUIZ SHOW, DONNIE BRASCO, CITY HALL, and SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER, THE INSIDER has a tight, tight script, moves at a great pace, offers an insightful story about humans, and has terrific performances and cinematography.  Michael Mann pushes the quasi-documentary camerawork perhaps just a bit too much for some tastes; I thought it was terrific.  A very deep nod of approval to Russell Crowe.  This is the sort of subtle acting that I don't think most folks realize is so special.  He details his performance so beautifully, even pushing up his glasses perfectly in character.  I could see both the reserved southern gent in him as well as the man who has a problem managing his anger.  The only time it doesn't completely work -- and I would suggest it was a writing and directing problem -- is in a scene in which he is badgered to get on the telephone. His sudden explosion is more a movie mannerism than a glimpse of reality; little matter, though, as he quickly makes the scene work.  A terrific performance from Christopher Plummer, too.  (And Al does fine, keeping the ham largely off the plate.)The only movie that touches this one in 1999 is THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY (or, much more arguably, TOY STORY 2 and THE STRAIGHT STORY).  THE INSIDER is more than worth checking out; it's something of a treasure.",

If you liked American Beauty, come see its strongest Oscar challenger so far this year.  Personally, I find The Insider to be hands down the best film I've seen so far this year.People will say (have said, actually) that it's boring or too long.  If you see this movie, be prepared.  It is long.  But I never once looked at my watch (notwishstanding the fact that I don't have one), and I was never bored for a moment.  I was completely engrossed from start to finish.  At movie's end, I would have happily sat down again (after a brief stretch) and watched it again, despite the lateness of the hour.The performances are magical.  Pacino, Crowe, and Plummer all must be seen. Let's hope this pushes Crowe up a notch in the realm of professional respectability.But it's the direction that makes this film.  When it's praised, it's the director being praised.  The long pauses, which irritate some (when it's criticizes, it's the director being criticized), provide the viewer with a peaceful moment which is needed to process and come to terms with the material.  The story is not thriller material, but the direction provides all the tension and excitement of a thriller.  But most thrillers are mindless, and a savage, relentless pace doesn't hurt the narrative.  In this film, however, the tension and excitement must never be allowed to obscure the story.  The pauses allow for the audience to stay with the story.  They are gently pulled along with the events, rather than having images and ideas simply thrown up at them.Lastly, I would just like to point out that Lowell Bergman and Jeffrey Wigand, as they are portrayed in this film, are probably the two most heroic, admirable characters I've ever seen on film.",

            "content": "The Insider By Dean Kish\tMichael Mann delivers us deep into the biggest health reform issue in US History. \tThe Insider chronicles the stresses, manipulations and betrayals involved in bringing a highly damaging story to network television. The story is about scientist Jeffrey Wigand, played by Russell Crowe, who is deep within one of the largest tobacco companies in the world and decides to tell the truth about what cigarettes do to you and me. As Wigand's story unfolds as he befriends a producer Lowell Bergman of the CBS primetime show `60 Minutes', played by Al Pacino, who tells him that he can get his story to the air and blow open the `conspiracy' beneath. As these two friends walk the fine-line they become overwhelmed and embroiled in a world they can't control. \tThe Insider's director Michael Mann first burst onto the scene in the mid to late 80's with the primetime cop show `Miami Vice'. As `Miami Vice' exploded into the Top 10 most watched shows, Mann dropped back to write and produce the show. As the show came to a close Mann had transformed primetime cop shows and the life of Don Johnson. It was about then when he electrified audiences with the first movie explosion of `Hannibal Lecter' in 1986 with `Manhunter'. It was through this experience that I think Mann honed his directing skills and began to draw audiences in. He knew how to capture the emotion and delivery of important dialogue. After the unknown TV movie `LA Crackdown' in 1989, Mann once more exploded onto the big screen with 1992's `Last of the Mohicans' which became a huge hit and brought him into the forefront of American directors. It took three years to bring us his next film. \tMost Hollywood executives and even some of Mann's peers thought he wasn't up to the task of directing the high-fire Pacino-DeNiro square off dubbed `Heat'. But when the movie premiered critics cheered and it shocked the box office. This success secured the arrival of Mann and his epic story telling.Another three years later with the debut of the `Insider' he has upped the ante again and delivered a movie that topples even `Heat'. The angles and impressive acting talents are all in place as they were in `Heat' but it's the ingenious script and dialogue camera captures that rocket us this time. There aren't any explosions but explosive portrayals. Mann knows how to capture an actor and get the best out of him or her. The two plagued friends Pacino and Crowe are amazing but I think its Crowe who needs an Oscar nod. He put on 40 pounds and transformed himself into this paranoid man trying to deal with unreal circumstances. Another worthy Oscar look would be Christopher Plummer who I have never seen deliver this caliber of a performance as the anchor Mike Wallace of the 60 Minutes. He is amazing and it's his believability that draws the audience in believing we are actually behind the scenes of the news show. Mann has out done himself and this film amazed me. The stress and dialogue can be felt as these people's world is uncovered a layer at a time. For some the dialogue, the running time of over 2.5 hours or even the subject matter may sound boring but this film was far from a bore. (5 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.",

Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised to see Crowe take the brunt of the acting and really run with it. He was superb in this film and deserved the ocsar for best actor this year (sorry Spacey...you were good, but not that good). Pacino and Christopher Plummer both added to the mix as volatile elements in a taut and well-directed film by a truly great filmmaker who has lots more chances to shine - Michael Mann (Heat and Last Of The Mohicans are two of the best films of the decade). Hell, even Wings Hauser and Phillip Baker Hall get in on the act and deliver great performances as well. Amazing. If you haven't seen this movie yet...what in the name of Scorsese are you waiting for? Brilliant acting, brilliant cinematography, and an astonishing cast and script add up to without a doubt, the best film of the year - American Beauty, for all it's merits, was way overrated in my opinion.

Al Pacino gives another fine performance as CBS `60 Minutes' television producer Lowell Bergman, trying to maintain his old-fashioned radicalism while surviving the tyranny of the suits and protecting his source.\nIt is Russell Crowe, however, who sustains the two and a half hour movie as he portrays the former Brown & Williamson scientist, turned informant and science teacher, Jeffrey Wigand. I actually viewed `The Insider' after I saw `Gladiator' and it is astonishing that the same actor could have so ably taken on both eponymous roles. For the former, 34 year old Crowe takes on the persona of a man 18 years his senior by putting on 80 lb, while grey hair, glasses and sheer talent do the rest. This true story has an uncompromising message: cigarettes are delivery devices for nicotine and the companies that manufacture them are deliberately trying to make users addicted to them.

This was possibly Mann's triumph in using hand held camera work, which has in the last few years adapted by people like Winterbottom, Greengrass and Liman.But the film's aces are the actors...and all of them.

Also, as a person living in the South, I admire the film for not portraying Southerners as idiots, as many Hollywood films do. And I loved the unconventional soundtrack.If I had to find something to complain about in this film, it would be that I think Jeffrey Wigand fades a little too much into the background towards the end of the film; his reactions to events could have been detailed a little further.

In one part of this story the chief protagonist is a journalist who believes that news may change the way people perceive the world. This man is Lowell Bergman and he produces the TV show 60 minutes. The second main character is Jeffrey Wingand, a chemist who worked as executive and researcher for big corporations, including one of the biggest tobacco companies. Just after being fired from his last job, Wingand starts thinking of the crooked strategies used by the tobacco industry to addict its consumers. Wingard and Bergman are both constrained by corporate rules yet they must fight against them to maintain their own principles. Maybe they simply know too much and can't hide certain company secrets anymore. In reality, Jeffrey Wingand did indeed denounce certain claims made by the US tobacco industry. He stated that the tobacco CEO's knew exactly what substances were inside each cigarette. Wingard's testimony was the first step toward changing the relationship between the US government and the tobacco industry. It was also a big media event planned and detailed by an unknown producer of one of the biggest US TV shows. Besides this true story, The Insider focuses on the personal drama in which the characters are driven by moral conflict. Both Wingard and Bergman expose their choices in obtaining their victory. They were ordinary people under extraordinary pressure. On the other hand, they also gave up vital everyday values, such as security and stability. It is not by chance that Wingard's wife asks him for a divorce. For his part, Bergman quits after working more than a decade for 60 minutes. Their personalities and values clash with corporate regulations and their employers react in a hostile manner. Wingard and his family are pursued and investigated. Bergman is not allowed to show his program as he wished. All the professional and ethical values to which they dedicate their lives suddenly disappear. From the corporation's point of view, business and law are more important. In other words, the professional status and security they enjoy appears to be a company possession.",

In The Insider, director Michael Mann executes these subjects flawlessly on screen as he relies on these subjects to convince the audience that nameless, faceless, and voiceless characters shall prevail over greed and evil. The film, based on a true story, unfolds as Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), a tobacco executive, is fired from Brown & Williamson and confides to journalist Lowell Bergman, who wants to reveal publicly in 60 Minutes that the chemicals in their tobaccos are dangerous. 5 out of 5 stars.",

The music in it just gives me goosebumps.      The film is a very interesting, detailed look into the corruption of industries and the corruption of the media. Michael Mann is a superb director. He really knows how to bring a scene to there full potential. Observe the \"faxing\" scene. This could have just been a regular scene, but with his use of the camera, fast editing, and good music, it makes a simple scene suspensful.      The acting in the film is top rate. I couldn't find one bad actor in the film. I think Russell Crowe deserved an Oscar more for this performance than his \"Gladiator\" performance (He was good in it though) . I think it is a crime not to have given an Oscar to Al Pacino. This is some of his best acting in the past decade. I can't believe he wasn't even nominated for Best Supporting Actor, nothing.      This is a very long film, though. It goes into a great amount of detail with many of the issues the film addresses. And I do think some of the scenes went on longer than they had to.

In fact if you look at the top of the title page of The Insider in IMDb, you'll notice that it says Biography|Drama|Thriller. So don't nag about how boring the movie is!The main plot is very interesting. The Insider tells the story of a former top researcher of a big tobacco company Jeffrey Wigand(Russell Crowe), who is approached by Lowell Bergman(Al Pacino), producer of CBS News' TV show \"60 Minutes\", when Bergman learned that Wigand wanted to blow the whistle on his former employers. The dramatization of the original story fits nicely. But the screenplay holds back the story. Probably only average thing about the movie.Director Michael Mann was between good and very good. Same goes for Al Pacino. But Russell Crowe was very good. The film editing could have been better. Score and sound editing were amazing.So The Insider managed to win 7 Oscar nominations. But lost all of them. Now why is that? Was it a conspiracy against the movie by the tobacco companies? Or there were better movies? I myself believe that the film lacked the final touch. Something to push it past the finish line. May be a remake of the film can fix all the flaws and claim it's rightful place.",

Wigand's testimony was critical for the exposure of \"Big Tobacco\" as a set of companies that knowingly lied to the American public about the effects of their products on public health.The characters are very well handled, everyone was convincing and did a terrific job of \"being\" these people. I thought Pacino was terrific and was surprised that he did not get a nomination for best actor.For me the best scene was where Wigand is about to be deposed by the Attorney for the State of Louisiana (or was it Mississippi?). It made me cheer for the system of states that we have now, where corrupt judges from one state are not able to shut down justice in another state (i.e. just because big tobacco has several judges in Kentucky in their pocket, other states are able to carry out their own investigations, thanks to state's rights).Bottom line: I would urge all citizens of the United States to see this film. It is an accurate depiction of the system we live in today. Its not a pretty picture, but it is riveting, and maybe, things can change.",

This is by far one of the BEST movies Hollywood can or will ever produce. The subject is delicate and extremely well handled; movies on whistle blowers are not uncommon, but showing the corporate corruption and the cover-ups that upper echelons of the society engage in needs some mastery over detail and know-how. The real insider for me is Michael Mann. I would be belittling Al Pacio and Crowe if I attempt to say anything about their performances in the movie; words cannot describe it. I watched the movie eight times in a space of three months and bought the DVD to watch it couple more times. It gives me the feeling that this is what any movie should be about--reality, hard core reality exposing the corruption inherent in the systems we trust in. Be it CBS or Brown and Williamson, their corporate honchos must have squirmed in their seats while watching this movie (if they had the ticker to do so, that is). The courtroom scene needs special mention: \"Wipe that smirk off your face\"--these six words actually set my heart pounding, making me feel as if he was shouting at me.

So what is missing? Well, we should rather ask what is there too much of? And the answer, in my opinion, is perspectives. The writer and director have taken a true story (the cover up by powerful tobacco interests of health risk from smoking) and looked at it from the p.o.v. of both the snitch (Crowe) and the investigative journalist (Pacino) who fights editorial corruption to follow up the story, and more or less equal weight is given to each. I would suggest that by far the more interesting of the two stories is that of the snitch, the common man whose conscience is so heavy (and bitterness so strong) that he even sacrifices his beloved family to get the truth out. As it is, the stories of the two men kind of trip each other up; perhaps there was even material here for two films. Whatever, it's certainly an immensely absorbing and at times very moving account of common (and not so common) people caught up in a shameful moment in American corporate history.",

Crowe was great, and I was impressed by Pacino's performance, who I've admittedly lost confidence in over the last decade or so.  Probably his best in many years.

Wigand is a scientist who is fired after he finds out that the tobacco company he works for, chemically alters nicotine. Bergman is a producer for the CBS show '60 Minutes' who entices Wigand to speak out against the tobacco industry. Based on the Larie Brenner article 'The Man Who Knew Too Much', Eric Roth & Michael Mann write a thorough and enticing screenplay.Russell Crowe gives his best performance to date. His subtle and heartfelt performance anchors the film. Gaining ? pounds and greying his hair, Crowe transforms himself into this sympathetic character. We feel his anguish and pain. Al Pacino gives an underrated performance as Lowell Bergman. He is efficient & gets the job done, but he truly cares about the stories he works on and Pacino shows this perfectly. Crowe and Pacino play their parts perfectly and their character chemistry is great. Christopher Plummer gives a good, albeit overrated performance as Mike Wallace. Diane Venora gives a natural, underrated performance. Her chemistry with Russell Crowe and emotional depth give the film a heart. Philip Baker Hall, Gina Gershon, and Colm Feore add veteran backup. This is an efficient cast, but the film loses steam when Crowe, Pacino, or Venore aren't on screen together.The cinematography, sound mixing, and editing gives the film a documentary feel to it. Michael Mann's rapid, fast-paced editing succeeds in making the film seem shorter than it actually is. Mann uses very small things to develop tension in between characters. The films only fault is the pacing down the line. It feels like it has several endings. But just as soon as it starts dragging, a key encounter occurs that grips you back into the film. This is a surprise because Heat & Collateral were expertly paced.All in All, this is a film that is well acted and directed, but poorly paced down the stretch.",

Jeffrey Wigand called it \"rat poison.\" Warfarin is a rat poison in huge quantities and can be made from green leaf volatiles, it is also a life-saving drug that prevents strokes and heart-attacks.

Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) is a \"60 Minutes\" producer who wants the story told. For the next few hours, you watch the behind the scenes power struggle from all perspectives. You see Bergman (Pacino) risking his career by fighting the CBS corporate execs over a basic issue of \"right vs wrong\". Dr. Wigand (Crowe) also risks and loses everything when he chooses to do the \"right\" thing and share his story. The film brings forth strong emotions from both Pacino and Crowe. So strong is their acting that you lose sight that these two are just the actors and not the real participants. Earlier I mentioned that this is the \"ultimate film to date\" on exposing the ills of our society....previous exposures came in such great films as \"Class Action\" and \"Civil Action\" and in the story of a real life whistle-blower, John Dean (Watergate). \"The Insider\" almost makes you wonder what would have happened in this country 25 years ago if the \"Washington Post\" was afraid of being sued as \"60 Minutes\" was in this story. Bottom line...while this movie takes 180 minutes to tell a \"60 Minutes\" story, you will feel like the \"ultimate insider\" as you witness some very sad moments in recent history.",

It is really amazing that this film even got made.  Russell Crow surely deserved the nod over Kevin Spacey for best actor.  It was one of the greatest performances I've ever seen.  My only gripe at all was Michael Mann's style of photography in the film.  While certain individual scenes looked fantastic and were enhanced by the director's dramatic use of color and light, as a whole, it was too much.  Almost every scene was different somehow from the previous, causing distraction and sometimes even confusion. Still, this movie was more than a joy to watch.

How thin can one's integrity be stretched before you can no longer live with yourself? These are just a sample of the themes explored in Michael Mann's engrossing \"The Insider\", a parallel examination of former tobacco executive Jeffrey Wigand's whistleblowing 1996 testimony against corporate giant Brown & Williamson, and \"60 Minutes\" segment producer Lowell Bergman's struggle to expose Wigand's sobering evidence to the public. The screenplay's structure is intriguing: as we follow Wigand's back-against-the-wall attempt to reclaim a modicum of self-respect after years of looking the other way, he concurrently loses all of the treasures, both meaningful and materialistic, he has accumulated in his career. Comparatively, as Bergman struggles to bring to light Wigand's shocking revelations, his once-united front of journalistic truth crumbles as his \"60 Minutes\" colleagues cave in to the potentially devastating legal ramifications of revealing to the public information that Wigand is forbidden to share. All of the Mann touches are here: the good (muted wide-screen compositions, unusual soundtrack selections) and not-so-good (too-frequent hand-held shots, overlength, underwritten female roles). In any event, this trenchant true story (despite some dramatic license and composite characters) is well-served, particularly by Crowe (nearly unrecognizable as Wigand) and Pacino (convincing as the relentless Bergman). So focused are these two, whether together on-screen or apart, they are never less than riveting.",

Several times during the Insider I kept thinking to myself, is this the same guy??? I had the same thoughts while viewing his other recent film in which he played a football coach.  That film was so bad, I can't even remember the title. One part I will remember most about this film is the portrayal of Mike Wallace.  It was a hoot! If you have not seen the film, Christopher Plummer acts as if he is playing Mike Wallace on Saturday Night Live.  It is a totallytongue in cheek funny send up (I really don't think Mike could be that much of a buffoon in real life).  I could see why Mike was so mad about the characterization.

It illustrates the cold bloodedly greedy ruthlessness of the tobacco industry and the dire implications of big media taking money as a priority over the truth.It's almost surreal, but all too creditble, to see a big corporation act like a thug, openly threatening people, using their own families as de facto hostages to get their silence.  However, that didn't surprise me considering I have read about these hoodlums' antics in at least one book called \"Merchants of Death\" which also illustrated the underhanded tactics of these jokers.   Also see them threatening to sue CBS for broadcasting the truth and the truth itself only makes the case worse is a bizarre echo of the famous Peter Zenger case. In the 17th century American colonies in which truth for a supposed libel printed by a newspaper publisher was not considered a defense back then and it took a brilliant lawyer representing Zenger to change that.  There are many things we have to deal with in our times, but refighting the Zenger case in the civil law sphere should not be one of them.  However, what was even more ominous was the waffling of CBS News as they buckle to corporate pressure.  What you see in this film illustrate the very same tactics that major media critics like Noam Chomsky have noted that big media is prone to do.  For instance, the censoring of Mike Wallace's interview about being censored was excused on the basis on time constraints. This is what Chomsky has noted as the tactic of \"concision\" where time constraints are use to limit debate and discussion to make you have to speak only pat & bland statements because to say something really unexpected and new would simply too much time to explain between commercials.  In short, this film is an excellent companion to the film Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media (1992).This film is a real eye opener and an absolute must to anyone who wants to know was both big business and big media are capable of doing.",

The question of how far a man should go for the truth, the responsibility of the media when information becomes \"infotainment\", the nasty machinations of the professional media machine...good stuff all.  Still, sometimes it almost got lost in all of this that cigarettes and Big Tobacco were the real enemies, not Don Hewitt of \"60 Minutes\".The real reason to see this movie is to check out some super acting by Al Pacino (in his most restrained recent work) and especially Russell Crowe. He surpasses his work in \"L.A. Confidential\" with a skillfully nuanced performance as a volatile, troubled man who decides to take a stance in order to satisfy his own tangled motives, and who finds himself in deeper than he had ever imagined possible.

This is more than a good movie, it's a masterpiece.  In fact, I would say that it is the second-best film of 1999.  In my opinion, this is a superior film to \"American Beauty.\"This film has many good things about it, but there are two that really jumped out at me.  The first is a phenomenal, passionate performance by Russell Crowe.  He becomes Wigand, and it is truly not a glorious role.  But it is an honest role, and Crowe plays it honestly.  Wigand is a down-to-earth man, like you or me, but he knows something, and he feels that other people need to know this as well.  This is not intelligence that is driving him, exactly, it is ethics.  I am not saying that Wigand is not intelligent, rather, that anyone who has ever felt the tug of ethics can relate to what he's feeling.  Crowe is one of the boldest actors that we have, and this role is truly a risky one.The second thing that really needs to be praised is the brilliant cinematography of Dante Spinotti.  Great camera work is hard to come by. When a cinematographer takes too many risks, the viewer is disoriented. When not enough risks are taken, the film is boring.  Spinotti gives this film a bizarre visual image that never disorienting, but, somehow (and i can't explain how), helps us see the characters in a very human perspective. That's why I chose to use the work \"brilliant,\" because true brilliance is difficult to explain.Like any film, this one is not perfect.  The direction is, at times, too heavy-handed, and we become a little bit aware of the film's length towards the middle (this is perhaps the fault of the writers), but no film of recent years sees a social problem so clearly and deals with it so honestly.**** out of ****.",

In the beginning its not a difficult story to grasp. The good and bad guys are pretty much defined early on. The tobacco conglomerates are the bad guys of course. Even the smokers would agree with that. One day Wigand decides to divulge some of his former employers more questionable production practises to the media. Here the media is represented in the form of hard driving '60 minutes' producer Lowell Bergman, played by Al Pacino. Everything goes well until one day journalistic ethics clash with corporate priorities, then its all on. Enough said.What to me could have been a boring 165-minute docudrama turns into a gripping story as it delves into ethics in the press and the angst and moral dilemmas which sometimes occupies our top news staff. Some would say not enough angst. The performances are exceptional and the principals, Pacino and Crowe have received worthy mention but some of the supporting cast also give of fine studied portrayals of their characters who are people still living. Gina Gershon deserves credit as an icy corporate lawyer, and Christopher Plummer as 'Mike Wallace' gets it down pat. The arrogance, the humbleness is all there.  Mike Wallace also gets all the best lines. But although his character comes out flawed in places to me that showed him as more human, not the brusque interviewer we see on TV, and consequently more likeable.

            "content": "The Insider is a film in which people talk. A lot. They talk over dinner, they talk in cars and more often than not they talk on the phone. And yet it never bored me for a second. The main reasons: an intelligent, grown-up screenplay that never gives in to cheap entertainment, Michael Mann's spectacularly sweeping yet semi-documentarylike direction and, of course, the great performances.Michael Mann and Eric Roth based this tale of the modern day David-versus-Goliath battle between whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand and faceless sigarette juggernaut Brown & Williamson (and journalistic integrity) on a Vanity fair article. It has led to a powerful script, not only succeeding in showing the issues it deals with, both also (or perhaps most of all) succeeding in telling the emotionally captivating story of Wigand himself. The film's certainly aided by Russell Crowes masterful performance, but the writing itself deserves attention for being emotionally gripping without ever being sentimental and for keeping the drama real (although it's basic story is fictionalised, of course). However, the only problem I have with this film also lies within the script. About 100 minutes into the film shifts its perspective from Wigand to Lowell Bergman, the producer on 60 Minutes, who's trying to get Wigand's testimony to the screens. A lot of people have already pointed this out as The Insider's main flaw, and I'd have to agree. Wigand is the tragic figure of the story, not Bergman, Wigand is making all the sacrifices, he's having his life ruined for telling the truth, not Bergman. Wigand's ordeal is far more captivating than Bergman's and therefore I would have preferred it if the film had continued focussing on Wigand. The fact that Crowe is absolutely brilliant and Pacino merely very good, doesn't help either.As for directing, I think Mann is becoming better and better. I never really liked his older films. I remember seeing The Keep and being...well, baffled. I remember seeing Manhunter and although I enjoyed it, something didn't work for me. It always felt like style over content. With Heat however, Mann won me over. And with the Insider he proves he is still evolving as a director. The Insider looks great like any other of his films, but much like in Heat, style never overshadows content. It's always there to enhance the mood of a scene. The same goes for his genius use of a genius soundtrack (by Pieter Bourke and Lisa Gerrard). Still, the most amazing thing is the Mann's masking of the fact that this film is all talk.Finally, there's the acting. I said it twice, and will say it again. Crowe is perfect as Wigand. He brings across every emotion not so much through words, but through facial expressions and body language. And he never does it in a way that is noticable as being 'acted'. Also, Crowe looks the role, having put on more than a few extra pounds. Watch this in conjunction with, say, L.A. Confidential, or Gladiator and you'll see Crowe is a total actor, a chameleon almost. And although he got a deserved Oscar for Gladiator, his performance here is more finely tuned. Pacino, on the other hand, is very good, but he's not exactly doing anything new. He's convincing but in certain scenes comes close to the overacting more suitable for The Devil's Advocate. The supporting actors are all good or better.In short: Until the perspective shifts an emotionally powerful, highly intelligent, brilliantly acted and directed film, after the shift the 'emotionally powerful' is confined to the few scenes Crowe has left and the 'brilliantly acted' makes way for simply 'very well acted'. Still, I love the first part so much (and like the second part enough) that I can't rate this any lower than 9/10.",

Not only did I find the movie extremely interesting, I found myself learning a thing or two about television production and tobacco companies.  I felt extreme sympathy for Jeffrey Wigand as he struggled to reveal the truth about tobacco to the American public.  Russell Crowe may have misstepped in Mystery, Alaska, but he is back to the height of his acting in The Insider, a powerful performance rivaling the one he gave in L.A. Confidential.  Al Pacino was fabulous as well.  I know that this film was early in release, but I hope that when Oscar nominations come out that this film is not forgotten.  This movie is one that is completely rewarding, and its use of tension as the source of interest for the audience should be use in more movies that are being made.",

            "content": "\"The Insider\" is the best film of 1999. (\"Fight Club \"comes close, though) Michael Mann's direction is in your face, and he develops the story perfectly. He succeds in making both of the two main leads very real and complete characters, which can be very difficult, especially since he also brought out strong performances with the supporting cast (Especially Christopher Plummer). The cinematography is excellent, and Pacino and Crowe should be nominated for their performances. (Which I assure you, they will be) Even though the film is basically all talk, it never loses your attention. (The cinematography has alot to do with that) The film runs close to three hours long and you feel it, but I think it was entirely necessary in order for you to get the feel for what the characters were going through. Mann and Pacino maintain the same great chemistry that they had in 1995's \"Heat.\" I don't think I've ever seen a film that depicts the courage it takes to speak the truth in quite the way this was done. I voted this film a 9.",

But enough about that, let's look at the movie.Crowe and Plummer turn in top-notch performances, and Pacino, well, he's Pacino. A little overblown at times, but nothing to get annoyed with. He did a fine job as well. Plummer in particular amazed me with his job portraying Mike Wallace, a man who I hold incredible respect for. I wouldn't say this performance sullied the reputation of Mr. Wallace one bit.The movie drags a bit early, but as you get into the heart of the movie, you have developed characters. You don't question the motivation of the characters because you understand their processes. Some of the conversations could have probably been tightened/cut, but some are well worth the time (especially the fax-to-fax conversation between Pacino and Crowe).There are plenty of devices used to keep the movie from becoming too bogged down -- the intimidation factor of the big industry, in particular, is actually quite creepy -- and the movie is pleasant to look at, with nice work done by Mann and crew.The only downer was the theater I watched this movie at, as the seats sloped downward. Not the floor, the seats themselves. My fiancee and I both agreed to rent this movie when it hits the shelves to watch it again in comfort! Plus, it's good enough to see again.P.S.--The Pepsi girl (you know, the one who has those \"funny voices\") is in this movie. Thankfully she is subdued. To top it off, the trailer for \"Bicentennial Man\" played before the movie, also including said Pepsi girl. She's everywhere. Ugh.",

            "content": "After an appalling 1999 at the cinema, I at last found a wonderful film to rival and even surpass the wickedly funny Election. \"The Insider\" has it all: an enthralling true story, a vitally important subject, moral complexity, superb craftsmanship, intelligent writing, excellent and passionate acting, and interesting and morally muddled characters. Even the \"heroic\" whistleblower is portrayed as a flawed and hesitant person who was quite content to enjoy an enviable lifestyle for years on the basis of his highly paid job at a tobacco giant. He frankly admits that his main motivation for taking the job was money, with the self-deluding hope that he might make a useful contribution to research. As a recent British immigrant, I found it hard to scrape up much sympathy when he was forced to leave his luxury home and was sadly reduced to living in a pleasant suburb and driving a Volvo estate - a pretty high living standard by European yardsticks.Similarly, Mike Wallace was portrayed as a mixture of political calculation, professional pride and personal vanity. The decision to water down the \"60 minutes\" expose under legal challenge was shown as shabby and shameful, but not wholly unprincipled.The only person shown as wholly pure and devoted to revealing the truth was Al Pacino's dedicated producer/investigator. This was a noticeable flaw in the writing; if all the other main players are shown as crooked or morally compromised, why is he spared? But this is to quibble about a detail in a most worthwhile project. My main regret is that so few feature films are dedicated to important factual issues. A cursory glance at any major newspaper reveals dozens of potentially enthralling films which would not only enlighten the audience, but be far more entertaining than most of the fictional drivel I have seen in recent years.",

The story of intrigue keeps one on the edge of their seat wondering how the Insider will manage to testify under the pressures mounted by his old employer. The added twist of CBS caving to money interests and pressure, thickens and intensifies the plot.Powerful consequences: Reviewers mention how well the film depicts big tobacco. Perhaps true, but what is most impactful, is how the film portrays the behind-the-scenes of 60 minutes. This film was only lightly marketed because of complaints from CBS and Mike Wallace. In June of 2000 - years after the film was made - Don Hewitt of CBS gave a speech to 1000 journalists filled with angry rhetoric for Lowell Bergman. Mr. Bergman - a former 60 Minutes producer - is the person Al Pacino plays in the film, and who consulted on the film when made. See what makes CBS and Wallace so unhappy - Watch the Insider.",

Cinematography is key, every little detail taken care of, we all know Michael Mann's style from Heat but he really nails it with this picture. Master in adding drama and taking you to the edge of your seat when you don't actually see a single weapon (or not in use anyway), or explosions or deaths or anything like that in the entire reel, this is all accomplished throughout vision and prevision in all aspects of film directing.

This is Mann's best movie and my third all time favorite behind Zodiac and Pulp Fiction. Despite Pacino struggling to get the interview aired he makes being a producer for 60 minutes seem like it would be a very fun job to have.

However, Michael Mann directs a film that captured me from beginning to end and never once did I feel restless throughout the entire three hours.We all know the story and probably most know how it ends.  This film is about standing up in the midst of strong opposition and doing what one feels is the right thing to do.  This theme is often portrayed in cheesy sitcoms and dopey films, but this film shows how much of a struggle it was for Wigand and how he almost gave up doing anything at all, making him all the more human and inspiring.  Michael Mann's film shows Wigand as a human being, rather than an idealized hero.Russell Crowe gives the performance of his career, which is saying a lot since he has continually impressed me with outstanding performances.  His work, along with the rest of the actors besides Basinger, on \"L.A. Confidential was ridiculously shut out of most award nominations.  Although Basinger did a great job, Crowe was just as deserving of recognition.  I believe he will give Kevin Spacey a huge run for his money when Oscar night comes around.  Spacey, Crowe, and Carrey will all battle it out for what may be one of the most intense Best Actor competitions in recent memory.Al Pacino gives his usual powerful performance and, since this is expected, his fabulous work will probably gain little fanfare in terms of nominations.One complaint about the film: it the last 20 or so minutes of the movie, Wigand is completely forgotten and Pacino's character becomes the central focus.  This seemed to shift the movie in an entirely different direction and it seemed to run of course.Overall, an excellent film that will compete heavily with \"American Beauty\" as the best movie of the year.",

I couldn't watch her on screen without wanting to punch her in the face for those stupid commercials.  But I digress.Al Pacino gives an amazingly understated performance as the producer of 60 Minutes who gets Wigand's story on the air.  After Mann's last collaboration with the actor on Heat, I expected a little more over-acting, but was pleasantly surprised.The only fault of the movie is that it does run a bit long.

I thought it was going to be a good entertaining action-thriller like Heat or Absolute Power, but wrong I was. The Insider proved me wrong about one thing, Michael Mann. Having made so many movies about bad guys getting shot, and sweaty cops screaming at each other, he underlines the facts that made his other movies so good, in the Insider. It's much more difficult than you'd think, and it presents Mann as a professional and experienced movie director, who finally gets a shot at what he really wants to do.The Insider was entirely about people. There weren't any high-budget action sequences to boost the entertainment value. To make it even less commercial, it was filmed with handheld camera, and it didn't even try to look good, but to describe in detail the lives of the people involved. First I was uncomfortable with the filming style, but I soon realised why it was necessary. There was a certain realistic flair to it that made it even more touching, and it made the viewer either focus on the characters and the plot, or get bored.The plot was very complex and it would have been very hard to follow if Mann wasn't such a good director. He has a firm grip of the cast, and doesn't let anyone overdo their performances. The dialogue isn't the hip, smart-ass kind you find in a lot of movies, but realistic and free of well thought out one-liners. They actually talk like real people do, and the humour is very low-key. The actors are in on it too, and no-one does more than his own part. The overall style is semi-documentary, touching th viewer on a deeper level, because these are real people.The special thing about this movie is the way it depicts people. Usually in this kind of genre, the people are just tools used to get the plot moving, and machine guns and cars are the real protagonists. Michael Mann always portrays the people in bigger detail, and shows how the events affect them. In the Insider he throws away all the commercial gloss that remained in Heat (not much, though), and makes the ultimate Michael Mann-film, a humanistic thriller-drama at it's purest.Besides the stuff above, Mann also delivers some intelligent media criticism, showing how capitalist executives can smother the truth and deceive the public in the name of the dollar.

Russell Crowe gives a breakthrough performance as Jeffrey Wigand, the recently fired tobacco company scientist who knows too much and is torn between doing what he feels is right and staying safe and alive. Al Pacino is the \"60 Minutes\" producer who wants him to tell all. The film was directed by Michael Mann, a filmmaker I'm not entirely familiar with. I know he was responsible for \"Miami Vice\" in the 1980s, and he directed \"Heat\" a few years ago, a film that I considered decent but overblown. Here Mann uses techniques that seem borrowed from Oliver Stone and Martin Scorcese to create a wonderful feeling of tension. The score is brilliant, and the cast second-to-none. Pacino tones down his recent penchant for over-acting by turning in a fiery yet intelligent performance. Crowe is sure to be the Next Big Thing, as long as he continues to choose intelligent roles such as this one. Other notable performances include those by Christopher Plummer, Colm Feore, Diane Venora, Phillip Baker Hall and Gina Gershon.Definitely one of the best, if not THE best film of 1999.

Michael Mann has done a fantastic work. He throws the viewer into a voyage filled with constant tension, the hallmark of every good thriller. Ok, being based on a true story makes somewhat easier the job of the director - we can easily identify with the characters, because (that\u00b4s my case) we imagine ourselves in their shoes and think, \"Wow, what would I do if I were him/her?\"The plot, full of twists, is frighteningly familiar to all of us with some sense of reality. That\u00b4s the real world, folks. Powerful men and institutions don\u00b4t give a dime about any of us, simple mortals. We are merely the tools they use to get richer and more powerful and that\u00b4s it.Once in a decade or so, and out of millions, comes someone who goes about his/her business with a tremendous sense of justice and righteousness. The Insider is about two of such persons, two men - whether or not the real story is exactly like that, it does not matter. But I have a feeling that whatever happenned in real life may very well be close to this movie.Al Pacino, as usual (I have no words to characterize his acting - superb, out of this world, to be remembered, the master of masters, someone who breathes acting like others breathe air), fantastic. He is older, one can see that, he looks a little bit tired, but what a tremendous performance this man has achieved.Mr. Russel Crowe...his performance is worth a nomination for an oscar. He is strong, fragile, cold, emotionally unstable, a loving father, a knight who fights for justice, knowledgeable, a good friend...what a character, and what a performance. He is the main emotional engine of this movie, and has made it big. He is a nominee for this year\u00b4s oscar, together with one of the greatest actors alive - Denzel Washington. He has a definite chance of winning this one, but it will be tough.The rest of the cast...Plummer, the great actor, is his usual self-centered man who goes nuts when someone \"screws\" with him...pardon my english.Good soundtrack, also.I thank Michael Mann, the actors and the studio behind them, for bringing us (the public) their vision of the events surrounding the discovery that tobacco companies are playing with every smoker\u00b4s life...and everyone\u00b4s life, by the way. I haven\u00b4t yet seen the other movies nominated for Best Motion Picture Award, but The Insider seems like a good choice.Good movie. Good directing. Go see it.",

The movies starts somewhere in Northern Israel of the South of Lebanon (I am not quite sure) and when I went seeing it I had no idea what it was about. So I thought it was about the PLO or the Palestinian-Israeli issue but the first part of the movie was completely unnecessary. Okay one might state that it was meant to show what the profession of Bergmann is about and like but that could have been accomplished in other ways than sending an expensive crew to such a country.And the first hour there's nothing happening. The meant-to-be-artistic slow motion shots are annoying and not functional at all. Main character Wigand is played by a good actor, but the story is a complete flunk. It can by summarized as 'guy shouldn't talk, guy does, guy is sadly left by wife and children'. I can hardly keep my eyes dry.. what drama!And I was even more surprised to see that Pacino is the center of the second part of the movie. The screenplay doesn't divide its attention evenly at all. All of a sudden the movie changes color by putting all attention to Pacino and his problems to get the bloody interview aired.Christopher Plummer is good though.. but there are to many gaps in the screenplay to let him save the movie...And it could have been such a good movie... too bad...Mann was trying to combine personal drama (Wigand), professional drama (Bergmann) and a cheap John Grisham court-drama. It's too long to keep the viewer's attention... hello people? where is the so-called haunting suspence?6 out of 10 points.",

The fact that the industry cares more about money than health issues, despite how harmful their product is, lied about it, threatened Wigand and CBS, makes my blood just boil!

A wonderful cast, that includes Al Pacino in a more subtle character than his recent movies, Russel Crowe delivering big-time in a complex character, and Christopher Plummer who is nearly flawless as Mike Wallace, is what drives this movie.  Unfortunately Mann's direction is a tad too stylized.  Mann favors the \"behind the ear\" camera angle too much, and the overuse of jump-cuts becomes tiresome toward the middle of the movie.  Toward the end of the movie, Mann relaxes his narcissistic techniques that supposedly \"define a director\" and simply tells the story, thus redeeming his past mistakes.  The story is well worth telling.  Lost in the wake of the OJ Simpson verdict, this true and riveting tale of morals, big business, red-tape, and perseverance is now being told with incredible dramatic force by this talented crew of artists to those that will listen.  The script, the movie, Plummer, the cinematography, and perhaps Mann will be nominated for an academy award.  In a weak year such as this, both Pacino and Crowe could receive nominations for Best Actor though the bronze statuette is sole possession of Kevin Spacey for American Beauty.  This is an excellent movie, it may end up being one of the top 5 of the year, but only Plummer might end up taking home an Oscar.

            "content": "Critics at large have their work cut out for them when it comes time to compile their top ten film list of 1999.  This year has been extraordinary as far as high quality films go.  One thing is for certain; \"The Insider\" will grace many a list.  \"The Insider\" is not only one of the best films of the year, but of the past decade.  There is no doubt that this superior film will rank in many Oscar nomination categories. \"The Insider\" is based on the 1996 Marie Brenner's Vanity Fair article \"The Man Who knew Too Much\" about Dr. Jeffrey Wigand, a cigarette research & development executive who was fired by the tobacco company he worked for.  The film is a behind the scenes look at the events that took place that caused CBS's \"60 Minutes\" to blow one of the biggest stories of the decade concerning the negligence of the tobacco industry.After Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) is fired from his job, he is pressured by \"60 Minutes\" maverick producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) and his own conscience to blow the whistle on the tobacco industry for misleading the public on the dangers of cigarettes.  But at the last minute executives at \"60 Minutes\" decide to pull the plug on the interview segment between Wigand and TV news journalist Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer).  In the process Wigand, who went out on a major limb, has his life destroyed as he gets caught in the crossfire between the tobacco company and \"60 Minutes\".  The tobacco company attempts to discredit him by exposing everything about his life and \"60 Minutes\" practically abandons him after deciding to cancel the segment, which might have a negative effect on the sale of CBS to Westinghouse.  Producer Lowell Bergman was the only one from \"60 Minutes\" that managed to stick to his guns and a good portion of the film focuses on the relationship between Bergman and Wigand.The true story in itself is a remarkable piece of drama with the high power villainous tobacco company, heroes Wigand and Bergman, the responsibility of journalism, etc.  Director Michael Mann turns what is already a compelling story into a superb and brilliant piece of filmmaking. Although known for his stylish action sequences (\"Heat\", \"Manhunter\", \"The Last of the Mohicans\"), Mann does a masterful job with this intricate and complicated media event.  The terrific script and cast make his job even smoother.  Al Pacino heads an amazing cast of actors.  Pacino, who I have always admired, sometimes lets his histrionics get in the way of his performances, but here in the character of Bergman, he give a understated and very focused performance, one of his best in some time.  Mann seems able to rein Pacino in as he did with \"Heat\" and the result is obvious.  But the true stars of this film are Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer, both names, which should be mentioned during academy nominations.  Crowe, who was so powerful and amazing in \"LA Confidential\", is just pure brilliant here as Wigand. Crowe plays this emotional problematic and complex character the complete opposite of his LA role by showing a man imploding from the outside in.  He is just mesmerizing to watch as he deteriorates from the pressures that surround him, including his domestic life.  A magnificent performance. Christopher Plummer, an excellent actor that we do not see enough of, is totally compelling as Mike Wallace.  His monologue of \"how he will be remembered\" is truly moving.  Playing a live personality is not an easy task for an actor and Plummer pulls it off flawlessly without even looking remotely or sounding like Mike Wallace. He captures Wallace perfectly and is so believable in the role.  Others here do good work including Debi Mazar, who finally lets go of her tough New York gal that she is known for, unfortunately the talented Lindsay Crouse is wasted as Bergman's wife and Diane Verona does not fare very well in the unsympathetic role as Wigand's wife.  Her performance seems out of place with the rest of the cast.\"The Insider\" reminiscent of another great film, 1976's \"All the President's Men\" shows Hollywood at it's best.  \"The Insider\" should be on every film buffs list.

I remember watching tv and seeing Dr. Wigand on Sixty Minutes and I thought to myself \"What a courageous man!\". When I heard about\"The Insider\" I said to myself you have got to see that film. I did just that today. This is not your typical movie showing the latest in computer graphics so it will not appeal to everyone. For those who enjoy a behind the scenes look at events that have occurred in real life then check it out.I really feel that things are far more evil than even this film intimates. I do hope that lawyers can be tried for war crimes against humanity. Gina Gershon played one superbly and she was supposed to be one of the good guys. Dr. Wigand put everything on the line to do the right thing. What gets me in this insane world is that the whistle blowers are given no protection at all. They are expected to do the right thing and then take it in the ear. And guys like Sammy \"The Bull\" Gravano who has admitted to killing 30 plus people in cold blood gets witness protection, plastic surgery and the right to keep his ill gotten gains. Where the hell is protection for the whistle blowers that are trying to protect us from greedy, amoral and thorughly ruthless b****rds that run corporate America and multi-national corporations. Logic would dictate that we help out the whistle blowers. Luckily for Dr. Wigand things worked out sort of. Unhappily for us the tobacco industry seems to be stronger than ever. This film is really important for the outstanding commanding powerful performance of Al Pacino. If for no other reason Al Pacino's character in this movie stands for a person who is as good as his word. He in short has integrity in a world that has lost even the knowledge of what that word ever meant. If you are discouraged by the state of things then go see this movie because there are still a few good people out there.",

Mann's also known for his \"Thief,\"\"Manhunter,\" \"The Last of the Mohicans,\" \"The Keep,\" and\"Heat.\"  He also won an Emmy for \"The Jericho Mile.\"  Mann has a terrific eye and style that is strongly reminiscentof William Friedkin back when Friedkin was good, say, \"Sorcerer\" and \"The Brink's Job.\"  That is to say, he uses an extremely stylish mix of documentary techniques (hand-held cameras, quick cuts, occasional long stretchesof dialogue) and the more \"cinematic\" (fades, dream sequences, unnatural lighting).  The visual sense of \"theInsider\" is impeccable, thanks to the cinematography ofDante Spinotti.  Thematically, Mann's films usually involve an accomplished loner's attempts to maintain hislevel of self-respect and professional expertise when theworld around him is changing. Here, the story is interesting, albeit at about 2hrs and45 minutes it's way too long.  And structurally the filmhas one big problem:  the first two thirds of the moviechronicle the conflicts-- he worries about his children,his wife leaves him, he receives death threats, there areimplications that he considers suicide-- of tobacco scientist Dr. Jeff Rigand (played by Russell Crowe) goingpublic with his inside information by granting an interview to \"60 Minutes.\"  This portion of the film islyrical and beautiful-- Edward Hopper-like realism slowlydissolves into memory and fantasy-- as it shows the interior state of conflict.  However, once the decision ismade not to show the interview at 60 Minutes, the moviebecomes a parallel story of one producer's (Al Pacino)fight to maintain journalistic integrity in a corporateworld.  Although both stories are intriguing, after thevery slow, methodical, suspenseful build-up of the firstsection of the film, the second seems rushed and not asimportant-- there's a sort of a \"been there, done that\"feel to that part of the film.  And it doesn't help thatthe film clearly considers the real hero to be Al Pacino--the final (slow-motion) shot is of him resigning his position, bravely going out into the cold, mean streets,turning up his collar, all to a lot of really loud music that doesn't match the rest of the film (thinkof the music you hear every time Bob Hoskins shows up in\"The Long Good Friday\").  The sequence that opens the film, with a hooded Pacino negotiating an interview withIslamic fundamentalists, and then acting as an intermediary for 60 Minutes during the bickering that precedes the filming of that interview, doesn't really addmuch to the overall flow, either.  That is, the correlation is obvious, equating the terrorists with thetobacco industry, and showing that it takes an intrepid,ethical force to be heard by both sides, but the movie isasking too much of the viewer to equate one man's personal (ethical and professional) conflicts with another man's professional conflicts.This is a terrific, complex, intelligent film, filled with great performances (Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallaceand Russell Crowe as Dr. Rigand are sure to get Oscar nominations), brilliant direction and camerawork, thatworks on all levels.",

Don't get me wrong.  This is a good film, it's just not a great one. \nThe film's main asset is, obviously, the true story upon which it is based. The lengths to which tobacco companies are prepared to go to suppress information and distort the truth was always going to make captivating viewing.  The question is, did the director capitalise on this and create an exceptional film?   I don't thing he did.  Michael Mann's directorial style reminds me of a kid who just got a new tool box for Christmas, but doesn't know how to use any of them.  The film is DRENCHED with \u0091dramatic pauses', \u0091meaningful slo mo's' and \u0091moving classical scores.'  Although such devices are often PRESENT in great films, they don't MAKE a film great.  It just depends on how they're used.  In this case, Michael Mann simply threw them in everywhere in the hope that people would walk out saying \u0096 `I mean, like, wow!  How good was that bit where the guy took 15 minutes to peel off his coat?  It was just so DEEP!'If anything, the overuse of these devices gave the film a slightly clinical, colourless feel, which detracted from its emotional impact.  I kept sitting there thinking \u0091I really SHOULD feel sorry for Jeffrey Wigand, but I just can't seem to empathise with him.' As for individual performances, I thought the stand out was Christopher Plummer.  His portrayal of veteran 60 minutes anchorman, Mike Wallace, was superb.  Russell Crowe was solid as Jeffrey Wigand, but didn't live up to the hype. Although the make-up team deserves full credit for ageing him twenty years (and Russell himself did well to stack on 10 or so kilos for the part), the acting itself was only fair.  Those of you who saw his brilliant performance in LA Confidential are bound to be disappointed.Al Pacino did well playing 60 minutes producer \u0091Lowell Bergman', but it was a fairly two-dimensional role \u0096 \u0091tenacious, old school newsman, who plays it by the book and never breaks his word.'  All you really needed for the part was a good voice and a haggard face.  Al Pacino has these qualities in spades.  The only other performance worth mentioning was Diane Venora's portrayal of Jeffrey Wigand's wife.  I thought she was dreadful.  I have no idea what type of accent she was trying to pull off, but whatever it was, she failed. In summary, The Insider is a very solid film.  If you haven't seen it, I urge you to \u0096 not because its brilliantly made, but because it tells an important story.",

It certainly features the performance of the year, from Russell Crowe as embattled tobacco industry  insider Jeffrey Wigand, and I thought that Oscar should have also tapped Christopher Plummer for his beautifully detailed cameo as Mike Wallace. Mann's reputation as a master filmmaker is enhanced by his work here, which is tight, uncompromising and brilliantly controlled.The almost painterly compositions of the shots and the dogged, unstoppable editing rhythms make the movie fly by even as sequences linger; a tense encounter on a driving range, an intruder in Wigand's garden, a hotel room wall that melts into a memory.Mann's use of point-of-view in the shots is consistent and phenomenally effective: almost every scene shows how subjective perspective is easily opened up by the introduction of peripheral material. the script, by the Oscar-winning writer Eric Roth and Mann himself, is crackling and taut and never once steps wrong. There's no grandstanding dialogue or poetic turns of phrase. It's just slice-of life, and the characters are all smart and sympathetic or stupid and hateful because that's who they are, not becausethe plot needs a kick in the impetus.

But of course much of this story comes from the real-life inspiration of Mr Wigand and the 60 Minutes coverage of his whistle-blowing activities on the tobacco industry.  It is also a fantastic demonstration of how to make an action movie with NO action.  Well, not in the Jerry Bruckheimer sense of the word.  For man the action is all in the characters and the beautiful way that Pacino, Crowe and Plummer especially draw you in to their inner worlds.  For some, latter-day Pacino is just too much like prime ham - but here just give the movie a couple of viewings and you'll realise how well he acts.  It's a wonderful turn and utterly appropriate for a TV producer.If you want to see a gripping movie this might not be where you would instinctively turn, but trust me - just for the scenes on the golf course, and when Wigand is on the stand about to give his deposition (I climbed the sofa the tension was so immense!) - this film can provide excellent and stimulating 'action'.",

With an outstanding cast including Al Pacino,Christopher Plummer and most notably Russell Crowe,the story is driven and enhanced by the acting talents and storyline that reeks of big business,corruption and white collar crime that is effectively portrayed and brought to life by credible performances and moving drama that appear to take place as if for the first time for camera and viewer as if scripted per chance.This is first rate filmmaking that appears at once and yet altogether as if the action is forthcoming but nonetheless held back,as if by happenstance.With this technique,the audience is held in suspended animation,awaiting with bated breath each upcoming scene,that will either come clean or dismiss the previous telltall sign of doom or gloom.A great conspiracy film that is neither fake or contrived,being too real and straightforward and also documented to dispell any myth about its authenticity. The movie has a nice flow and rhythm and Crowe and Pacino play well off each other,building their characters from scene to scene and adding nicely to the drama that is unravelling with an almost surreal texture of undercover madness that is lurking to strike and knock down at any moment.But with its subtle nature of impending doom that coulda,shoulda,woulda but never quite does,the viewer is held in obligatory observance of results that seem too easily pending the fate and control of others that can't be seen or heard from.That is the true nature of grand mal conscienceness and conspiracies gone foul.Only in this film the conspiracy is all too real and perpetrated on an unsuspecting victim {The american public} for the good of big business who robber baron the health and pocketbooks of those who need its product.A better example of the fleecing of a generation or 2 of people and its filthy desire to profiteer from its insidious marketing of a product who's  only true use is to futher its insatiable lust for more and deeper want,has not been put to screen with this degree of seriousness and savoir faire.Christopher Plummer is quite effective as Mike Wallace and the 60 minutes anchor who stands head over heels tall when it comes to integrity and life experience as a new journalist who knows the ropes and how to dance around power plays.But even he has a hard time with this agenda,being a historic ballbreaker of monumental status that defies even his grandeur.This uncover story is world shaking and touches many if not all of mankind. And this film will also touch many,as it is dramatic,very well acted and has all the ingredients of suspence and unravelling that make for great cinema.It also happens to be based on fact which heightens its impact. 4 out of 5 star or 8 out of 10 for a smoking display of drama and its aftermath.

The fact, that of all current \"based on a true story\"- Hollywood films \"The Insider\" is the one which stirred upcontroversy the least, also shows that Mann was very precise in the treatment of the facts (note: there is no criticism of \"The Hurricane\" and \"Boys Don't Cry\" intended, simply because I haven't seen them yet and I don't forget that in adapting a true story for cinema it's simply necessary to compromise). \"The Insider\" convinces in nearly every detail: Manns direction is straight to the point and always finds the appropriate tone. There's always a feeling of danger and threat in his film, keeping the tension on a high level. Also worth to mention is how the film deals with questions on integrity and responsibility. Its depiction of the working procedures of the american corporation system is accurate and as Russell Crowe has put it in the Sunday Times interview, it is miles away from the paranoid conspiracy theories of the likes of Oliver Stone. That brings me to the actors: the supporting actors -among them Christopher Plummer and Philip Baker Hall (also to be seen in \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\" and \"Magnolia\") - are all very good and Al Pacino does a good job as Lowell Bergman, but the one who beats them all is Russell Crowe as Jeffrey Wigand. Crowe (who was already great in L.A.Confidential) is simply outstanding! I honestly think that Russell Crowe should get the oscar and not Kevin Spacey (well, Spacey is great in American Beauty, but he already got an academy award for The Usual Suspects). To me \"The Insider\" is just a perfect film and I already consider it as one of my alltime favourites. It is a real gem, flawless, essential. The very best film of the year. A well deserved 10! Can't wait to get on it DVD.",

The cinematagraphy is excellent, very cool, very artistic. Plus, if you think Russell Crowe is just a hotheaded frat boy with all looks and zero talent, see his turn as Dr.Jeffrey Wigand here.

He seems to repeat the same mannerisms from film to film and his character (the crusading journalist forced to betray his principles) is one seen in many films.  The dilemma of the whistleblower  himself (played very well by Russell Crowe) was much more interesting but didn't get enough screen time for real insight.The second problem was the directing style.  None of the methods used is poor in itself.  The trouble is that everything was overused.  I kept noticing every unnecessary camera jerk, focus change or cut.  If you find yourself consciously noticing style and missing the substance of the story, something is wrong.

This movie is not for those who only enjoy fast pace action movies.Al Pacino and Russel Crowe are as good as they are expected. In fact, the whole cast was good, and if you are acting lovers, watch it. You will enjoy the movie.There were some flaws in the movie too, mainly with the script. After all, it was a long movie and was slow paced. The climax seemed to start much early, but the real one was very short. When there are so many characters in a single movie, it is indeed difficult to manage them. But what does the director think? If you haven't introduced a character, and haven't even declared their names once or twice, would the viewer still get the true impression and their purpose in the storyline? Many characters were there, playing there roles in the story, who were helping the story to go forward, but their roles failed to create the instant reaction, and when they did, it seemed to be almost too late. After watching the movie, I feel like I will enjoy it more if I watch for the second time. But what about the first time? Many people will feel trouble to follow the storyline and dialogues, as they were intended to create. Many people will feel bored in the middle of the movie, trying to keep track of the twists, which are not that hard to understand, but very difficult to concentrate. No one likes to memorize every name in the movie by himself, and trying to figure out what that character is doing in the movie. I have given it 7/10, because it could be lot better than it was.

However, it does capture the feeling of a man under pressure, the Hitchcockian hero up against impossible odds. Chubby, bespectacled Jeffrey Weygand is our hero, played with enormous restraint by Russell Crowe. He's a man who, like most whistle blowers, wants to do the right thing, but is terrified about the after effects on his home and family. Enter 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman, played by the fast talking Al Pacino (who is less over-the-top than in his previous collaboration with Michael Mann). Looks like they want to do a piece with Jeff on 60 Minutes. That's when the corporate suits lay their knives into Jeff and the CBS studio goes into full damage control mode to protect their interests.The problem with such a story, no matter how brilliantly acted, how crisp the dialogue is, how beautifully it is shot by Dante Spinotti, how layered the sound design is, and how stirring the musical score (except for a few operas Mann throws in, which push the material over the top), we already know EXACTLY what's gonna happen. We've seen these paranoid conspiracy films before (mostly in the '70s), and there really ain't much new happening here.\nThen again, there was nothing all that new in Mann's \"Heat\", either, but it played like a first rate cop and robber story, and we didn't know who was gonna win the cat and mouse race. This time, there's no doubt.However, the production is impeccable all around, and one has come to expect nothing less from this meticulous, if unsubtle, filmmaker. Mann is particularly good with regard to fleshing out his supporting cast with great character actors. Crowe has the great leading role and Christopher Plummer effortlessly, gracefully steals his scenes as the hard boiled Mike Wallace, but let's not forget the who's who of great talent like Colm (Glenn Gould) Feore as an ever practical attorney, the brittle but always believable Diane Venora as Jeff's frazzled and unhappy wife, Rip Torn's good ol' boy lawyer, Michael Gambon's deadly purring cat of a CEO -- most of them only show up for a scene or two, but they create a strong impression.The movie does run close to three hours, but is compulsively watchable.

But the film went on forever, everything was so elaborate it just became tedious and overdone; it just didn't manage to reach the point that the viewer became really 'captured' and involved in what was happening on-screen. The occasional witty remarks of good old Al Capone (as I like to call him as an hommage for all his gangsta' rolls) were a relief, but after some time even this became a bit of a bore. He tried too hard to be a clown, it seemed, and it didn't really fit in the basically serious story. It wasn't just as tedious as another Capone film, 'City Hall', which also dealt with corruption on high political levels, but it came quite close. 5 out of 10, I'm sorry, Mr. Mann. Incredible that the IMDB users voted an average of 8.4...But: \"de gustibus non est disputandum\".",

            "content": "In writing this review, I'm tempted to address it to Don Hewitt and Mike Wallace. The Insider is a devastating film, but I think they are mistaken, if they see it as a blanket indictment of 60 Minutes. It's a blanket indictment of the tobacco industry. I don't think we will ever get to the bottom of what went on at 60 Minutes, with respect to the treatment of the Jeffrey Wigand interview. This movie is a dramatic piece that takes a stab at it, and I think that heaping criticism on Director/Writer Michael Mann is a huge mistake. This film shouldn't be picked at, it should be applauded. The spirit of this film is exactly the same as that of 60 Minutes. I doubt that most people watch 60 Minutes with a notepad in their hands. I think 60 Minutes gets people to think, and hopefully look into issues that are important. I believe that was Michael Mann's goal.The first issue to tackle is the presentation of Lowell Bergman, former producer at 60 Minutes, as the white knight of the story. There were complaints that Bergman got credit for things he didn't do, and that he didn't quit when they said he did, etc. I'm reminded of the avalanche of criticism that Oliver Stone received when he chose Jim Garrison as his vehicle to probe the JFK assassination. As Michael Kinsley noted at the time, critics assailed Stone for making a hero of Garrison, whom many considered a shameless self-promoter and a man of shaky morals, at best. While this attack was taking place, across the multiplex you could go see Warren Beatty and Writer James Toback's near deification of Benjamin Siegel in Bugsy. I'm tempted to say that it's Michael Mann's dime, so he can pick whatever hero he likes. However, I think the truth is that there was a wealth of information he needed to convey, and selecting Bergman as his vehicle was the best way to go.The second issue which had supposedly \"independent\" viewers up in arms was the aura of suspicion, manufactured or otherwise, that surrounded Jeffrey Wigand. This man will probably remain an eternal enigma. Was he exaggerating his claim of being harassed for some hidden agenda? Did he lie about finding a bullet in his mailbox? Did he try to cover up that he stole an electric can-opener?This second issue is at the core of my argument in defense of this film. Question: Isn't it more important that Wigand, a scientist who worked for Brown & Williamson, provided undisputed testimony that nicotine was being manipulated to bolster it's addictive qualities, than whether or not he stole an appliance at Walmart? Shouldn't people be more disgusted by the laughable testimony to congress by the seven heads of big tobacco (The Seven Dwarves, as he refers to them)?This movie became itself. It's a story of how many forces there are out in the world that seek to silence agitators. The simple truth is that Wigand, Wallace and Bergman had a story to tell and were crushed by some of these forces. Mann and Co-Writer Eric Roth wanted to tell this story on as big a screen as possible, and they got crushed, too. I'm surprised we didn't hear about how Michael Mann stole some lawn darts when he was in high school, or that Roth missed a Alfa-Romeo payment when he was in college. I hope this irony is not lost on Mike Wallace and Don Hewitt.It's no surprise that this film (vastly superior to the diverting, but hardly earthshaking American Beauty) was shut out at the Oscars. Kevin Spacey is one of our finest actors, but his character is not in the league of Russell Crowe's work here. Crowe's Wigand, with his birdlike and occasionally irritating behavior, with his egotism, with his intelligence, whoa! This is a performance. Reporters once again had a little fun when it was reported that Crowe didn't invite the real Wigand to the premiere. I guess this Crowe guy must be a schnook. Don't give him the Oscar.Truth be told, acting kudos go to all involved. Pacino, as Bergman, creates a stubborn character, who's not ashamed of his liberal nature, even when he's in a sea of conservatives. Christopher Plummer's controversial characterization is a delight as well. He gets Wallace's legendary tempestuousness, his egotism and his smarts down to perfection. The small characters are drawn with a sharp eye, as well. Alert to reporters: Mann's wife Diane Venora plays Wigand's wife. Bad news, though, she's a wonderful actress, and she's great here. Sorry.As the settlements from big tobacco come down, Mann's working on a film about about Ali, Bergman's back working in Berkeley where he belongs, Wigand is up to God knows what, and 60 Minutes chugs on, popular as ever. Memo to Mike Wallace and Don Hewitt: This was an excellent film. Admit it!!",

Al Pacino gives his best performance since Glengarry Glen Ross. And Russell Crowe plays his part very well, giving a powerful performance, his character develops and unfolds very slowly in the story and he couldn't have done a better job on it.      The first hour or so would give you the impression of a story with a simple, easy plot. But as you think the plot is about to take a rest and the movie will simmer down, it explodes in your face, you will be surprised at the way it turns into a movie more about the corruption of our justice system and the major flaw impossible to break. Rather than JUST a conspiracy on the verge of being exposed. Al Pacino's character changes dramatically as does Russell Crowe's. And both actors do an excellent job.\n     Although it is loosely based on the truth, it runs unlike other true stories.

There's also a film programme in Toronto which spent half an hour on \"The Insider\" this afternoon, featuring interviews with Michael Mann and Al Pachino. I don't think I can say enough good things about this film. It works so well on a number of levels: social conscience, acting, direction, script, music- all are in place to deliver one of the best films of the year.\nThe programme I cited above had a four-shot of Pachino and Russel Crowe with the real Lowell Bergman and Jeff Wygand. Wow! Crowe reportedly put on 50 pounds for the role. The resemblance to the real Wygand is incredible. Crowe's performance, in fact, is the best thing about the film. He allows the viewer to feel all the emotions the character feels as his life unravels. He is conflicted, motivated by both a desire for revenge and for an idealism which he thought he had lost. He is seeking to redeem himself in his own eyes, and the eyes of others. Pachino is the idealist, working within an organization which is making increasingly too many compromises to its journalistic integrity. As Bergman, relating to Wygand, both men seem to derive moral sustantence from the other.And.....the viewer forgets he is wathcing actors playing parts. The actors become those parts as whole cloth. The film contains a disclaimer that \"certain facts have been altered for dramatic effect\", or words to that extent. Major reshaping of history would have been the norm with a Hollywood film. Not this one: the Vanity Fair article demontrates that only minor changes have been made to sequence. The spirit of the truth is in place.

            "review_title": "The truth is out there",
            "content": "The title alone promised an exciting espionage thriller. When Marie Brenner wrote her Vanity Fair - article on a Kentuckan teacher whose brave court testimony forced the tobacco industry into an expensive law suit settlement the true story was already old news. \"The Man who knew too much\" neither had the resemblance of James Stewart, nor was ever rescued by Doris Day singing \"C'e serra, serra\". Still, writer/director Michael Mann found the incidents described so intriguing that he decided to make an epic tale out of it. To adapt the real life to the big screen he followed his \"heat\"-formula and created thereby the most powerful movie on modern-day journalism since \"All the President\" s Men\". Unlike Costa-Gavras questionable approach to the world of television news with the 1997 thriller \"Mad City\" Mann focuses much more on the behind-the-scenes settings than the obvious thriller elements. As with \"Heat\" he centers the whole story around two men who - this time - fight for the same good cause, but still are confronted with completely different living situations. While Dr. Jeffrey Wigand is fired from his job as a head researcher of the third biggest U.S. tobacco company TV-news producer Lowell Bergman negotiates an exclusive interview with one of the sheiks who possibly initiated the U.N.-bombings. Bergman is a small, energetic king of his little Reich which is the famous CBS news show \"60 minutes\". His goal in life is to provide the U.S. public with the whole truth behind the headline news stories. Wigand, however, just wants to continue making his living. He has two little daughters - one has really bad asthma - and a wife who is really not very supportive. In an ingenious opening montage we see these premises to the real drama intermingle. While Bergman and his interviewer Mike Wallace sit in an anonymous room in Teheran and talk to a fundamentalist terrorist, Wigand comes home and very quietly tells his wife about his sudden unemployment. Russell Crowe impresses down playing the humiliation and anger of Dr. Wigand who stands only at the threshold of a family life which is slowly about to break in pieces. The contact between these different characters is made almost in secrecy, by exchanging faxes. This initiates an awkward communication between Bergman and Wigand. It takes them nearly the whole movie to finally establish something like relationship, although they will never have the chance to become real friends. Bergman acknowledges Wigands struggle and he secretly admires him for his stoic sense of justice. Whereas media icon Mike Wallace has never better to say as: \"Where are these people?\" the second the Wigands may decide not to go public. In the meantime, Wigand loses his house, his medical insurance, his dignity, his trust, his wife and almost his two kids he cares the most for. He is willing to put all that at stake to help justice succeed, and it is the frantically realistic helpless way he fights his lonely fight against his former employers for which the viewer respects him the most. Of course, this is just a movie with a lot of alterations to the true facts, but still it is the most intimate depiction of an almost Don Quixotian  media war we' ve ever seen on the big screen. The camera stays very close to the actors, almost always observing their faces and painfully revealing the well hidden frustration behind their faces when they are confronted with the fact that CBS won' t broadcast the explosive interview. As the corporate lawyers tell Bergman: \"The bigger the truth, the bigger the damage.\" Meaning the TV network does not want to risk a law suit by the tobacco company Wigand worked for. Memorable dialogue lines like these are not presented with larger-than-life gestures as in Costa-Gavras \"Mad City\", but evolve almost naturally from the ever changing situations and problems the TV producer and his dependent news source are confronted with. Bergman does not hesitate to stay true to his promise and by playing out his connections he finally get their interview on the small screen. Again, Mann does it the new way in presenting the audience the fact that the written journalistic word is still more powerful than any TV picture, because it is the \"New York Post\"-Editorial which decides over Wigands future and leads to his rehabilitation after weeks and weeks of dirty campaigning against him. Still, at the time his face is shown on TV another story already catched the headlines - the arresting of the devilish Utah bomber. In that way, Mann concludes drawing his news cycle and points out that Wigands personal story - as life changing as it was for him - is only one small part of a media world which is stuck between journalistic truth and corporate decisions. That' s why the \"real\" Bergman resigned his job and went on making \"Frontline\" for PBS and teaching at UC Berkeley. Still, in the very last scene with Wigand we see him and his two daughters eating spaghetti in his own new apartment. \"The Kentuckan teacher of the year\" and his story finally resigns with a happy ending. It is Mann' s ability to build up suspense without any unnecessary violence which keeps this drama going and is best symbolized in one scene when Wigand glimpses at a burned down car wreck on the side of the road. Small, almost unrecognizable moments like this make this movie a treasure chest of great performances and powerful pictures. There are only few scenes where we really don' t trust the authenticy of what we see. Underlined with a hauntingly quiet soundtrack, composed by \"Dead Can Dance\"-performer Lisa Gerrard and an uncredited Graeme Revell this is the best drama of the year so far, and a sure candidate for the upcoming Oscar-nominations.",

Al Pacino's histrionics in certain scenes are just so, well, 'Al Pacino' that the character he is supposed to be playing gets submersed. The film feels flabby and would have benefited by losing at least half an hour. Russell Crowe however is outstanding as Dr. Wigand. Although playing a man about 20 years older than his real age you would never guess from his performance. Despite my disappointment with the film as a whole I would still advocate at least one viewing, if simply to be reminded of the lengths corporate business will go in the name of profit.",

            "content": "From seeing the trailer and hearing that the movie was a true story about a corporate whistleblower in the tobacco industry, I didn't think that this movie would be terribly exciting.  I did know, however, that this was Michael Mann's next project after \"Heat\"(1995), a movie near and dear to my heart, and that was what brought me to the theater.It turns out that I was thoroughly captivated by this story from minute 1 to minute 157. Told by any other director this may have been a real bore but the combination of Michael Mann, Al Pacino, Russell Crowe, Christopher Plummer, Dante Spinotti (camera), and the musicians make this movie incredible. Usually when I watch a movie that uses extensive cutting between two protagonists, one is more boring than the other and I can't wait to get back to the good one.  In this movie, the scenes with Russell Crowe are just as good as the ones with Pacino.I couldn't find a hole in the acting amongst anyone including Gina Gershon who I thought might screw it up.  Russell Crowe plays a perfect defensive, upper forties(he's really only 35), corporate and family man.  Al Pacino plays a perfect upper forties man (he's really 59) at the top of his profession.  I can imagine that it would've been pretty easy and tempting to vilify Mike Wallace but you won't find that here. Christopher Plummer portrays an intelligent Wallace who made me feel as if each of his decisions were rightly motivated by what he says is his main concern, getting old.\"The Insider\" is shot very similarly to \"Heat\" in that there are many, many, telephoto and macro shots.  Michael Mann must have the fastest lens available to be able to shoot telephoto in the dark with decent depth of field.  This closeness has a way of making a city look like a place made up of just a few people, who you get to know very, very well.I think Michael Mann has outdone \"Heat\" here and even though it probably won't get any Oscars, it should.",

This realism is heightened by the lack of prominent music which gives the film the feeling of a live program.  The acting is truely top notch.  After watching this film I had to re-evaluate my feelings on Kevin Spacey's winning of the best actor academy award.  Russel Crowe proves to be an exceptional actor in a very difficult role.  Crowe has a brilliant, subtle, style which is reminiscent of DeNiro's early work. Cinematography:  I think I comment on cinematography in almost every movie I see, and perhaps I'm a bit too generous with the praise I give but the camera work and lighting of 'The Insider' are magnificent.  Martin Scorsese once said that \"Cinema is a matter of what's in the frame and what's out.\" This is no more apparent than in 'The Insider'.  The extreme close-ups, the unsteady hand held shots, the unsettling shadows...Spinotti is a genius.Lastly I must mention that the film achieves more than artistic brilliance. It gives a clear message about a subject too often ignored.  It critiscizes the tobacco companies for lying to America and it also critiscizes the media for being more interested in money than journalistic integrity.  Worst of all this whole story is true.

In an age dominated by mindless action flicks that rely heavily on graphic violence and special effects, The Insider manages to maintain suspense for 157 minutes with not a single shot fired, not a single punch thrown, not a single drop of blood shed.  The cinematography was breathtaking, the plot engaging, every performance Oscar-worthy.While on the surface this movie seems to be plot driven, it is really a character drama.  Russell Crowe plays Jeffrey Wigand, a chemist and former tobacco employee being pulled in different directions: on the one hand his knowledge of big tobacco, on the other hand the well-being of his family. Al Pacino plays Lowell Bergman, a 60 Minutes producer who's quest for the truth and dedication to his sources is put to the ultimate test as Wigand (Crowe) comes under fire by big tobacco and as his own network abandons their morals, leaving Wigand to fend for himself.Russell Crowe gives an excellent performance, completely deserving of the Oscar nomination and (I thought) he should have won it.  Crowe is subtle, every facial expression conveys the anguish that his character is going through.  And Al Pacino gives a superb performance as always, delivering some though provoking and memorable lines with flair.  Michael Mann directs, and his attention to detail is impressive.

            "content": "I've been waiting to see this film for some time now, and while one could easily accuse me of sccumbing to Academy Award hype, the truth is that planned on seeing THE INSIDER all along, but never got around to it. Now I have seen 4 out of 5 of the Best Picture Nominees (all except THE CIDER HOUSE RULES).When I first heard about this movie and it's story, I thought, \"hmmmmm.... sounds like something I'd walk out on.\" Well, I didn't, and I enjoyed the movie thoroughly as well. However, also I'm aware of the fact that THE INSIDER is in fact based on real life events and altered for dramatic effect, I don't remember the time when those events actually took place, or what happened (News like that never interested me that much). My opinion can be called, at its core, limited.Now about THE INSIDER'S strength as a movie-- it has truckloads of it. The cinematography is quite edgy, and establishes a dark, uncertain tone with lots of bleak, muted colors. Mann generates tension without resorting to the standard chase scenes and shoot-outs. The actors play their characters as if there really is something tangible on the line, which helps highten the intensity. The film tackles some big issues and morals, including how a top-drawer news corporation like CBS was pressured by financial and legal issues to cut a major story. It's also about Jeffery Wigand's struggle with his conscience, his struggle against his former employers, and the hardship of him and his wife trying to accept the sacrifices they had to make.In some ways, THE INSIDER is like a two-act play. The first half, like I said before, concentrates mostly on Wigand and his circumstances, and he is in nearly every scene. Later on, the focus shifts to Lowell Bergman and the 60 Minutes crew as a battle ensues over journalistic integrity and the consequences of airing such a revealing story on the air. Actually, I found THE INSIDER'S first half to be unquestionably stronger than its first; the emotional core becomes slightly murky later on. Minor problems aside however, THE INSIDER is a very worthy film, and possesses a kinetic flow that never stops moving. There are very few slow scenes, and if there are, I can't remember them completely.Nothing ranks higher in THE INSIDER than the acting factor. Al Pacino is at his intense best here, even though this isn't a particularly \"new\" kind of role for him. He screams his head off in a lot of his movies :). Russell Crowe certainly deserved an Oscar nomination for his excellent work here. He finds every nook-and-cranny in Wigand's character. Like many memorable heroes, this guy is certainly flawed, and Crowe depicts him forcefully. Also memorable is Christopher Plummer in his version of 60 Minutes' Mike Wallace. He also suplies a great deal of intensity, and his single standout is during a scene when some of his on-air comments have been censored on a broadcast. Everyone else is solid, but I have to stop the commentary somewhere.This is one of those films where the energy level is always high, and keeps the viewer in until the very end. The concepts will certainly confuse some people who didn't pay much attention to the real-life events based on THE INSIDER (like me), but most of the focus is on the characters here. The end result is an endlessly compelling and engaging movie that combines the intensity of a thriller and a drama into a unique hybrid.",

This film has some of the best acting I've seen in years, especially in Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace. Plummer doesn't imitate Wallace as much as portray the intensity and drive that he is well known for. The Insider pulls no punches in attacking the cigarette industry (an easy target), but also attacks the hypocrisy of the news media wanting to be free to tell \"their\" side of the story at the same time wanting protection against any ramifications that come of it.

At the time, a film based on a 60-minutes piece didn't really draw my attention, and I really didn't care about the whole tobacco issue. If anything drew me to seeing the film it was Michael Mann, whose Heat is probably my second favorite.Seeing as how the story was modified for dramatic effect, and how I still don't really care about the whole big tobacco issue, I don't think the importance of the tobacco issue is this film's leading point. This film doesn't really make a statement for me - but it doesn't need to, because it's the best film I've ever seen. Performances, directing, screenplay, cinematography, score - etc. And powerful. I've read some reviews on here citing this film as being drawn-out or boring to the point of falling asleep - some of them might just need to pay a little more attention.",

Not a chance.  The tobacco companies sit back and laugh. The much-delayed revelation that cigarettes are bad for you has turned into a huge boon for manufacturers.  They have built whole advertising campaigns, aimed solely at the teenage market, built around the fact that cigarettes are 'bad', and therefore teenagers want it.  Then they simply reinforce the fact that cigarettes are addictive, and virtually impossible to quit.  With that message in your head, the impression that you are going to fail before you even start, it is small wonder that only a small percentage of those who 'quit' can stay away from these things.The government, of course, plays along, even taking handouts in the form of 'lawsuits' which they make token efforts to dispute, then settle out of court for assurances of protection from further lawsuits..a.k.a. bribe money.  The only truly responsible thing to do is ban cigarettes altogether, but you and I both know that will not happen.  Why?  Because cigarette sales contribute millions to our economy, and, more importantly, billions to all of the major political parties.  So the government makes sure everyone knows cigarettes are 'bad', and noone does anything about it.And THAT is the real tragedy.",

There's a bit near the start where they are having a conversation by sending each other faxes that is soooooo M Mann! And the scene where Crowe arrives at the court to give his testimony (which is your bog standard Lot's Of Journalists Standing Outside and People Saying 'No Comment') is simply magical.At 157mins, it's a bit short though (seriously!); it's even a bit rushed at the start, although he manages to dwell wonderfully on the stuff near the end.",

Al Pacino is better in this film than he has been in a long time.  This is the true Pacino, for admirers of his work.

Mann really pulls it off to make the spectator feel part of the drama - as a spectator, but one residing within the movie as it were. The brilliantly creative camera work and editing are reinforced by a restrained but effective soundtrack. As in Heat, Mann shows once again that he is close to being a cinematographic Mozart.",

The cinematography inn this film is absolutely exceptional with the camera most of the time being hand held right up there in the actors faces.

I have zero complaints, suggestions or criticisms with respect to the length of this film.  Mr. Siskel said it best (and I paraphrase..) no good movie is too long, no bad movie is too short.This is a good film.  This is a VERY good film.  It tells an engaging story with believable characters who are flawed and wonderfully human in every respect.  Characters who allow us to struggle with the age old decision of what is good for the many outweighs what is good for the few, or the one. The twist here is that the character making this decision is the one who will benefit the least from the overall good, which heightens the emotional investment tenfold.One aspect of storytelling I've always enjoyed is the treatment of the characters as organisms within the story.  Characters that evolve as if they were real people, and not just to serve the progression of the plot.  I always enjoy it when we see characters think in movies, when the story almost halts, to let us watch the characters make decisions as opposed to acting on decisions in order to meet the needs of the plot.This film allows the characters to exist in the universe it creates.  It takes time to let us see all the characters and get into their heads, so when the climax of the film occurs, we are alongside each character, understanding every action and decision they make.The Insider tells the story of a man so driven to do the right thing, that it destroys almost everything he's trying to protect.  This is not an easy decision for him to make, he is afraid of the consequences (losing his family, his reputation).  He is humiliated by his relationship with his former employer.  He is angry at being in his current position, and he is betrayed by all those he trusts.  Struggling to reconcile all these powerful emotions, Russell Crowe plays Dr. Wigand as a flawed, yet decent man.  His flaws are real, and no less human than anyone else's.  He is a man of science who feels he has betrayed his profession, made to do so by a corporation who promised him money and a better life for his family.\nIt could be argued that Dr. Wigand sold out, that he sacrificed the needs of the many to serve the needs of the few (his family) or the one (himself). But as a father, Dr. Wigand had to provide his family with the best medical care he could (as one of his daughters was very ill).The film begins with Dr. Wigand leaving work for the last time.  He has been fired.  He realized he could not be a man of science if he ignored the immense responsibility that comes with great power.  He realized he must look out for society, for the lives science tries to enhance. This is the backdrop against which we see every struggle Wigand endures to finally end up on \"60 Minutes\".I really enjoyed The Insider.  It's not a film that is overwhelming to the viewer because it allows the viewer inside the story, as opposed to throwing it at us.I would recommend this film to all fans of Mann's great visual style and anyone who loves a good story.",

Especially after brilliant performances by two of the best actors Hollywood has ever produced, Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. Even the support actors have done a brilliant job. Russell Crowe & Al Pacino both deserved Oscars for their role. Denying them the Oscars can be considered nothing short of a sin. Exceptionally well written by Eric Roth & Marie Brenner, the dialogues in this movie take your breath away. Some scenes in this movie just blow your mind out, especially the ones where you see Ron Motley portrayed by Bruce McGill, puts down the opposing lawyer with his outburst. And also one scene where Al Pacino goes out all wild for the network not letting him run his cut. And the most brilliant part of it is, its based on a real story with some drama thrown in, which is rightly acknowledged by the director during the end credits. A fast paced movie, that doesn't let you down, I would proudly recommend this to anyone.

The limited depth of field, blurring and floating camera add to the chaos, the fear and the characters' emotion in such a way that has not been seen for decades.

I dragged a friend with me who had no knowledge whatsoever of the film, and when it was over, he seemed to really have enjoyed it. Pacino and Crowe are excellent (as I'm sure you've heard), and even at 2hrs 40mns, the film moves along at a crisp pace. I usually am pretty suspicious of any film over two hours in length, but this one holds your interest the entire time. One point of criticism, though: There is an undeveloped (and unnecessary, in my humble opinion) subplot involving the Unabomber(!) case. I'm assuming this is because, in reality, \"60 Minutes\" was probably involved in this case during the story's time-period, but ultimately, this doesn't really serve any purpose in the movie. This doesn't really detract from the film, though, so it's a minor point. Hopefully, this wonderful film will get it's \"second wind\" (smoking pun intended!) on home video, pay-per-view, and cable.

It almost felt a bit like \"All the President's Men\", just not quite as good.Check this one out if you've already seen \"American Beauty\", and \"Fight Club\" so far this year.",

That is why it is with great surprise that I announce that \"The Insider\" is the best film of 1999.  I won't get too much into it, but this film tells a riveting story with great acting.  It is well written and beautifully filmed.  The cinematography by Dante Spinotti is outstanding.  he worked on \"L.A. Confidential\" which had a great look as well.  If we think of cinematography as the use of light in film (which is what it is), then this film gets it just right.  The scene that really stuck with me was when Pacino is sitting in the hotel lobby waiting for Russell Crowe.  The shadows in that lobby just lend a whole mysterious tone to their meeting and the way Pacino's whole face is in the dark except for his searching eyes is wonderful. This film is what a best picture should be: great story, great acting, great technical work.  Like \"Titanic\" except that didn't have a great story or great acting.  It also has a great group of smaller role actors which lend it a richness so many other films lose because they focus too much on the stars.  Phillip Baker Hall, Christopher Plummer and Bruce McGill (forever D-Day in \"Animal House\") are just a few of the names that add to the greatness of this film. Whod've thought Michael Mann could pull this off?  Not me.  Thanks to the Academy for forcing me to see this film.",

The first man gets personal and professional devastation as payment for his honesty and accountability; the second man gets insuperable disaffection as payment for his courage and integrity.\"The Insider's\" assessment of the American (military/industrial complex) dream consists of equals parts of bleakness and bitterness.

In two of his previous films, \"Thief\" and \"Heat\", Mann took great care to place his [male] characters in front of deeply calm, deeply blue-green watery horizons at moments of inner turmoil. As the seas calmed them, thus they were renewed for the rest of the picture. James (Thief) Caan goes to the waterfront with his bag of breakfast, breathes deeply. Robert (Heat) DeNiro lives in an architect's dream house of steel and glass with a perpetual thin line of blue sea/sky bisecting the view from his living room.In \"The Insider\", which I must admit is a brave, well-made picture, Mann once again places and lights his actors against an aquatic mise-en-scene so precise as to be painterly.Russell Crowe, in the film's biggest will-he-or-won't-he dramatic moment, faces out onto Pascagoula's Gulf of Mexico. Crowe's body is arranged just so in the frame, the waterline there, the trunk of the palm tree there, a distant sailboat there, none of this an accident. The photographic work is, again, simply stunning. Later, Pacino stomps about in an eerie green foaming Caribbean inlet, the color, and the waves, a sign as to his inner struggles with his own moral weight and the pressures of modern telejournalism.The supporting cast -- especially Bruce McGill -- and the ambient score are both a strong plus.\"10\" from me.

He has improved with each.  \"Heat\" was also an excellent film, but Mann improves on the grade A quality of even \"Heat.\"  I was blown away by \"The Insider.\"  I decided I had to see it when I realized it was another Michael Mann epic, and especially at the presence of Al Pacino.  Now, while Pacino gives yet another chill-worthy performance, Russel Crowe is the real gem in this film.  I am not sure that I have seen such a layered portrayal of a human's absolute despair since Robert DeNiro's Travis Bickle in \"Taxi Driver.\"  The acting alone makes this film worthwhile as does the pathos of Crowe's character.  Now add the brilliant rapid-fire dialogue and you already have a masterpiece.  This does not even include the cinematography:  which ranks right up there \"Saving Private Ryan\" and \"2001...\" for some of the best of all-time.  I have read statements that the film takes itself too seriously and borders on self-righteousness.  Not so. This is a crucial morality tale that explores the importance of not selling-out and doing \"the right thing.\"  These characters are far from self-righteous.  They are not even sure they believe in their cause. Please see this film.  This is an example of why movies are made.

            "content": "A previous review on this site made a succinct, apt comment about this film: \"This movie is for people who like to think....\" I cannot sum up my impressions of this film better than that. \"The Insider\" treats the audience as if it is intelligent, never force-feeding us data. Those of you who prefer to turn off your brain when watching movies, do yourself a favor - rent this movie and realize what you have been missing all this time.Russell Crowe (excellent as Bud White in \"L.A. Confidential\") plays Jeffrey Wigand, a tobacco executive ousted from his job because he won't play ball. Without saying too much, he has an insider's story to tell - about how the tobacco companies manipulate nicotine to make it more addictive and how he knows the \"Seven Dwarves\" (Wigand's term for the executives of the main seven tobacco companies) lied in their testimony to Congress.Al Pacino's character, Lowell Bergman, is a producer for 60 Minutes who wants his show to be the public conduit for Wigand's information. The film chronicles how difficult it is to publicize this damaging information not just because of retaliation by the the tobacco companies but by CBS's unwillingness to stick it's neck out on a vital public health issue.Crowe is marvelous - he effectively conveys the emotions of a tormented man, yet he never becomes a characture. Wigand is intelligent and wants to protect his family, and that never changes despite the odds. Al Pacino is excellent as usual - he convincingly portrays Bergman's dogmatic pursuit of truth and his high standard of never leaving a source hanging out to dry. The suspension of disbelief took over quickly for me. Early on, I stopped looking at Pacino and Crowe as Pacino and Crowe - they were Bergman and Wigand to me.This film affected me much in the same way \"Quiz Show\" did. Both films are in ways about \"the end of innocence\" by selling out principles to the almighty dollar. One convicting scene involves Bergman battling CBS legal department over the story. The gist of the lawyer's position is simply this: the more truth you tell, the more liable CBS is. If that's not twisted, I don't know what is.This movie should get you thinking about a variety of issues: what is a corporation's responsibility to the public well-being? Does corporate ownership of the media compromise what is reported? Is it worth all the personal sacrifices to make certain information public? If you're not thinking about larger issues after watching this film, you simply weren't paying attention.My rating: 9 out of a possible 10",

Unfortunately, the controversy in Mann's -The Insider- occurred only four years ago and the true, perhaps indelible impact Wigand's story had on the tobacco industry, on investigative journalism, and on America as a whole has yet to be felt.Mann's movie certainly details a provocative--sometimes infuriating--incident, however the film entertains without providing much analysis or insight about WHY Wigand's saga is important.  At over two hours, the story failed to keep my attention.  The film's saving graces are solid performances by Russell Crowe, Christopher Plummer, and Al Pacino; beautiful, moody cinematography; and an excellent score which includes classical pieces, opera, and fluid, ambient synthesized music.",

Fine performances all around, but particularly by Russell Crowe. I would only dispute some of the directional choices with respect to what I would say was dramatic effect over charaterization.For example, the extreme closeups and the soundtrack (much as I enjoy that kind of music) often made me wonder when someone was about to get shot; impending danger, yes, impending extreme violence, a slight overstatement, no? Additionally, I think a few corners had been cut in the characterizations of some of the important supporting roles such as Liane Wigand, and Mike Wallace. I felt the former's exit from the marriage seemed premature relative to immediate context of the narrative; similarly, Wallace's decision to side with CBS Corporate seemed to come out of left field. I believe in both cases the story could have foreshadowed a little better the capacity for the characters to eventually make the decisions that they did (the restaurant meeting scene wasn't enough to me). Instead, we saw extensive footage given to the opening Iranian sequences, the Unibomber sequences, though plotwise their relation to rest of the story was rather inconsequential.Moreover, I felt that the film towards the end dropped the development of who I thought was the protagonist, Wigand, to concentrate solely on Lowell Bergman's heroism. I think I would have like to see more of Wigand as 'survivor'.These points downgraded the film's quality for me, though on the whole, very good!",

Jeff Wigand (Crowe) is an ex-executive at Brown and Williamson (America's 3rd largest tobacco company). When Bergman approaches Wigand to be a consultant on a fire safety study on cigarrettes Brown and Williamson blackmail him into furthering his confidentiality agreement. Bergman can tell that Wigand has something to say but can't. So he sets up Wigand to testify in a court of public opinion on behalf of the state of Mississipi. He does, and he also does a CBS interview on 60 Minutes with Mike Wallace (Plummer). The information is simple. That the tobacco industry has been lying to the people about nicotine. That it is not only addictive but they also manipulate it to increase its addictiveness. But big tobacco are trying to do all they can to shut Wigand up. They use restraining orders, they treating CBS with a lawsuit and they start a smear campaign against Wigand. All these things separate Wigand from his family and Bergman from the rest of CBS. This was a fantastic movie. It deserved all 7 of the Oscars it was nominated for. Michael Mann's direction is impeccable as he shows what the people are thinking and the emotions they are feeling. The film is long but very engrossing. The film switches half-way through from Wigand giving the information to Bergman fighting to air the information. Al Pacino shows that he is one of the best actors in Hollywood with an Oscar worthy performance. But the star of the show was Russell Crowe as Jeff Wigand. His performance is perfect as a man torn between what is right and what is best for his family and he stops short of showing Wigand to be a persecuted hero, but as a man whose whole life is threatened by what he knows. Out of 10 i will give this film 9.5",

I left the theater thinking \"that is what a movie can be!\"Well acted, top to bottom, with masterful direction and writing by Mann. Most inspiring is Mann's willingness to use SILENCE, a concept lost to almost every director in the post-sound era. Music is added when necessary (as is dialogue, of course) but Mann lets the gaps do much of the work, to great effect.Pacino, brilliant as always, using a bit of his Ricky Roma salesman character, tempered with the heart of an idealist. Academy Award should go to Crowe, however, who turns in a career-making performance. Rest of cast strong in support.",

            "content": "I can understand why the validity of the truth behind this film might be questioned.  However, you have to realize that you have to see this movie for what it is:  A powerful story about strength, hope and how an individual can overcome REALISTIC, overwhelming odds.  Ironically enough, another film like this one was also overlooked by the academy, whose characters used hope and strength to survive more life-threatening situations: \"The Shawshank Redemption\".From the movie's excellent direction (a superior ability to make a thriller without action and still maintain the quick pace), wonderful screenplay,haunting musical score and especially the fantastic acting) will be a film to be remembered for a long time.The acting is incredible.  Plummer's performance as Mike Wallace is frightenly real.  Pacino finally gave up his screaming method-acting he picked up in \"Scent of a Woman\" and gave a subtle, energetic portrayal that is his best in years.But the actor who gives the movie its heart is Crowe's Wigand.  His is a performance that shows realistic struggles of what this man is going through and what he loses.  And when he does get his emotional battle scars, he maintains his silent composure, but reveals his pain through his eyes. His is the best portrayal of \"an ordinary man facing an overwhelming circumstance\" and should be an example of how to face our problems like a fighter, not a victim.I was extremely disappointed that he did not win for best actor.  Although I am a Kevin Spacey fan,  Crowe's was the most multi-layered, and the transformation was more thorough.  Unfortunately,  for the last 3 years, the academy has been blatantly showing that it's not the best performance that wins, but who is the most popular.  3 years ago, it was Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt who won for \"As Good As it Gets\", instead of Judi Dench for \"Mrs. Brown\" and Peter Fonda for \"Ulee's Gold\" (or Robert Duvall for \"Apostle\").  Then, 2 years ago: Gwyneth Paltrow for \"Shakespeare in Love\" and Roberto Benigni for \"Life is Beautiful\" instead of Cate Blanchette for \"Elizabeth\" and Nick Nolte for \"Affliction\" or Ian McKellan for \"Gods and Monsters\".  Now, Kevin Spacey came out of the blue for \"American Beauty\", based on this popularity.  The only redeeming factor was Swank winning for \"Boys Don't Cry\".Again, I'm a fan of Spacey's, but Crowe, as well as many others in this film, were robbed of the recognition they deserved. Perhaps the inspiration that is generated from the film to the viewer is good enough.",

            "content": "There are times that The Insider will leave you breathless. The story about tobacco-industry scientist Jeffrey Wigland's tormented decision to blow the whistle. It's a story that needed to be told, having become almost a footnote during a time when the media was running from the O.J. Simpson trial to the Unabomber.  Wigland risks everything he has in order to come clean on the deadly practices of the industry he worked for, and the movie tells his story ably.But the movie also tells the story of Lowell Bergman, CBS Producer who fights to air Wigland's story. And it tells of CBS's cowardly attempt to snuff it out. Each of these entities could have its own story, but THE INSIDER tries to tell them all and loses its focus in the process. Is the movie centered around Wigland, who risked the most? Is it about Bergman's fight to protect his sources? Or is it a damning indictment of the big-business news industry?Michael Mann would have been better to pick one of these players and focus on it. The movie begins with Bergman in Iran, setting up an interview. That scene was an apparent attempt to show Bergman's skill as a producer, but other than showing some exotic middle eastern scenery, it added little to the film that could not have been explained with a few lines of dialogue. The result is an overly long movie that has Wigland's story taking a back seat to the story of Bergman's stature.The female characters are weak, as another reviewer had pointed out. Wigland's family disintegrates from the pressure he brought on his family, but you don't really see the love they have. Dianne Venora is wooden as Wigland's wife, a role made much worse by her pathetic, Scarlett O'Hara-ish southern accent. She never questions her husband's choosing to play with the kids while she's left to unpack the moving boxes. This is love?Russell Crowe does an admirable job playing a complicated character, but suffers a bit under Mann's depiction of him. There was so much more his character could've added to it all.What I wanted this movie to show me was why Wigland risked everything to do what he did. Instead, it simply displays the facts as it sees them and doesn't go far in answering the question \"why?\" Nevertheless, THE INSIDER does a decent job at telling a tough story.",

Having said that let me also say that the movie was long and it's span was felt by the crowd.There were many scenes that could have been easily avoided and edited out of the final version. The movie is also extremely \"quiet\". There are many moments where people stare at each other for an average of one and a half minute without really \"connecting\" with the crowd.Again the acting by EVERYONE was superb. And Michael Mann's touch was evident throughout the movie. When the \"Insider\" was standing at the beach pondering the result of his actions it was pretty much a modern version of Sonny Crockett at the Miami beach before he had to arrest his girlfriend.I think that the movie-goers that are going for action will be disapointed. However those of you that are in for a good suspence film and would like to see how reality sometimes is better than fiction this film is truly one of the best out there.",

And a lot of people were left feeling let down by \"Heat\" (including myself),  but this film the \"Insider\" draws you in like some type of cinematic whirlpool.  I will not spoil the movie but merely state how this film affected me.Russell Crowe gives a great layered performance as the main character.  In the way he conveys the pressure he is being put through by the tobacco company, 60 minutes, his family and all sorts of other influences is almost painful but stunning to watch.  At times I wanted to yell at the screen and say \"will you just leave the guy alone\". Truly a man against the world feeling.  Pacino is very understated but powerful when the script calls for it.  I thought he was very well cast as the producer for 60 minutes.Another great aspect of this film is the way it lays bear the inside workings of the television and print media.  I thought stock brokers werebrutal.  Truly interesting to watch and to witness how a news story comes together.Well all in all a great story with well acted characters through out this film.  If you feel like being interested and educated by a film.  Well the \"Insider\" is most definitely for you.",

In this day and age NOW of knowing the cancer risks, the addiction, all things bad about cigarettes, the secret we learn isn't the reason to see this movie.  Rather it is the acting performances put on by the cast and the expert direction of Michael Mann, the sometimes too stylish director of previous Pacino hit \"Heat\" and the formerly the director of \"Miami Vice\"  he finds his mark so brilliantly here in the movie, using all the right techniques at all the right times and gets the most out of his actors, from little known Debbie Mazar to seductress Gina Gershon as a believable corporate lawyer.

The Steadicam wasn't steady, which was just plain annoying, and the DOP seemed to have a fetish for the technique of pulling focus - an effect that tires after the tenth time it is used. Oh yeah, in the restaurant scene the boom can be seen in one of the shots. Poor form.At the end of the day \"The Insider\" is a fantastic film that deserves all the accolades it may receive.

            "content": "Michael Mann's `The Insider' is not a great film.  It is a masterpiece.  It is simply one of the great films made in the past decade.  The criticism in which `The Insider' received was that it was not an original film.  It also been unfairly scrutinized by the media for it's `inaccurate' portrayal of the facts.  People often forget that the `The Insider' is not a recreation of a factual documentation of a story, but it is simply a film, it is the highest art of it's kind.What makes `The Insider' a masterpiece?  To answer this question, film lovers who would disagree with me, should watch the films of Howard Hawks. In both of the directors' films, they share an uncanny common parallel. They are masters of the physical aspect of the film making process.  Both directors believe that films must tell a story through the structural narrative drive, transitions of the images, cinematography, fluctuations in filmic rhythm, and especially the subtle execution of the realization of the film's thematic concerns.  All of these qualities are masterfully demonstrated in `The Insider.'In `The Insider' the film's ability to drive it's narrative, which it immeasurably serves to examine the character's psychological insight, makes it one of the great cinematic accomplishments in recent times.  This is the aspect of the film that causes people to denounce the film as `unoriginal.' Yet, `The Insider' serves it purpose by presenting it's narrative with a force that can't be produced in a thousand of these so-called `original' films made today.  `The Insider' is presented with candor and doesn't use any gimmicks to tell its story.`The Insider' is also one of the few films, in the tradition of Howard Hawks, as a film, which uses the aesthetic of oversight, of creating the mise en scene of implication rather than overly stating the film's thematic concerns.  Underneath the surfaces lie complex tensions between the character's pretense and their conscious feelings.  `The Insider' could have gone to great lengths of how smoking kills millions of people each year by showing an autopsy of a diseased lung or a demonstration of injecting nicotine on laboratory rats, but \"The Insdier\" is not a Spielberg film, it is a Michael Mann film.The photography of the film can also be described as momentous.  Dante Spinotti, arguably the best cinematographer today, executed the photography where it serves the film's purpose by fusing the image with tension and apprehension.  The most effective shot in `The Insider' is probably the close-up with the telephoto lens.  This shot effectively distorts the background, which gives the image an unclear tension, which infuses the moment.  The dull blue-green hues of the film also serve it purpose of creating an insomniac effect where the two characters are stuck in a nightmare in which they can't wake up from.With this film, along with `Heat,' proclaims Director Michael Mann as the best storyteller today.  Finally, the successor to Howard Hawks has been found.",

Every time I watch it, I notice something new--I come away from it with more of an understanding of the brilliance of this film.  Make no mistake, this is drama at its very best, with three outstanding actors--Al Pacino as 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman, Russell Crowe as ex-tobacco scientist Dr. Jeffrey Wigand, and Christopher Plummer as 60 Minutes' very own Mike Wallace--surrounded by an effective supporting cast.I won't bore you with a synopsis of the plot.  Too many reviewers get bogged down on plot and focus too little on what does or does not make a film work.In the case of The Insider, everything works, with the possible exception of a bad southern accent from Diane Venora, who has some great performances under her belt (The Jackal).  Let's start with the music.  A lot of people said it was bizarre but worked.  This couldn't be more true.  One of the scores used sounds much like a chant, but it works bacause it accentuates the conflict that is Dr. Wigand's life.  Among this film's most effective scenes is the one when Dr. Wigand is about to deliver a deposition and he standing before a body fo water trying to decide whether to go ahead and do it or pull out for fear of being arrested when he returns to Kentucky. You have to see it to truly comprehend the brilliance of the music of The Insider.Not enough could be said about the performances by Russell Crowe, Al Pacino, and Christopher Plummer.  These three actors are as fine as it gets. Pacino had fallen into a slump where he was over-acting a bit, as evidenced by his mediocre performance in Scent of a Woman, but he came back stronger than ever in The Insider, which was his strongest performance since The Godfather Part II.  Lowell Bergman is a rebel among conformists in The Insider and Pacino captures the conflict Bergman endured during the Wigand debacle--when 60 Minutes really dropped the ball.Plummer was brilliant as Mike Wallace.  In addition to actually looking like Wallace, Plummer acted like him too.  It was almost as if Wallace was playing himself in The Insider.Russell Crowe made a statement in The Insider.  Coming off an incredible performance in LA Confidential, Crowe, with his remarkable ability to play any role, proved to the world that The Insider was just the begining of a remarkable career.  Crowe is now in the same category as Sean Connery, Harrison Ford, Gene Hackman, Tom Hanks, etc.  He is here to stay and he is a giant.The Insider is simply one of the top 5 best movies of the '90s, maybe of all-time.  It's a classic and I recommend to anyone to see it because they won't regret it.",

            "content": "Michael Mann exceeds himself. He leaves behind the fast pace of Heat and shows a careful attention to detail. This film is all about reading between the lines. From beginning to end we are watching what people are not saying instead of what they are saying.The story briefly;  Sampson and Goliath but, without the frilly morality many American films cling to so slavishly. Dr Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe) is a research scientist for a large Tobacco company. He threatens the company policy of always keep the public in the dark and he is sacked for knowing too much.  Wigand struggles with his conscience. Does he keep his severance package (which includes a Healthcare plan for his family. His eldest daughter, ironically is asthmatic!)and become a company stooge? Or does he stand up, in isolation to warn the country of what is kept from them?This struggle is finally decided when he is pushed too far by anonymous threats against him and his family.  He turns whistle blower, with the help of Lowell Bergman (Pacino), 60second producer who cleverly lures Wigand into the bag whilst retaining his journalistic integrity.The crescendo of twists and turns leads us through Wigand`s angst and Bergman`s questioning of ethics.  The ending is not what you may expect. There`s no parties or champagne. Instead our two leading characters come out both winners and losers.Look out for the scene where Wigand is alone in his hotel room and Bergman tries to contact him via the hotel manager and a \"cell phone\". This scene is engaging and the diversity in the music used is beautiful. It captures a few seconds of true humanity.The fact that this is based on true events adds so much punch to the film it`s easy to forget we`re being entertained. It also gives us an insight into how the whistleblowers of our age are subject to massive smear campaigns. How would our lives stand up to the scrutiny of a media microscope?If you`re expecting the kind of pace in Heat you`ll get it after the introductions. If your`e expecting a Mann action extravaganza go rent  The Die Hard Trilogy or something. If you want a thinking man`s action flick rent LA Heat and Heat. If however you think you can handle the truth try this one. Be warned it may challenge your grey matter, unlike the formaluaic, good will out American Pie concept you may have.",

It seems as though after the dramatic non-happening in the first part of the movie it just seems to drag on, like producer and directors were saying to themselves \"we need more al pachino\" and some of the stuff the movie modified at the end seemed like total baloney to say the least, it seemed like the movie lacked a legal consultant... great middle and begining but the ending is too drawn out in my opinion.

Michael Mann's signature combination of strong visuals and subtle sounds gave the movie the gritty feeling he does so well and also so enthralled me for most of the almost three hours.

Some Americans should read about the evil propaganda methods of Goebels (remember?).

This film is a riveting tale of corruption in corporate America, of valuing money and personal advantage above traditional, basic fundamental human values such as respecting human life and telling the truth. Two courageous but imperfect men, and their allies, prevail in the face of an army of greedy, dishonest, egoistic, cynical people surrounding them. As such, this film does a masterful job in telling this story, in a powerful fashion that no documentary (well, perhaps if Ken Burns produced it, and Stephen Ambrose was still around to be interviewed, not having succumbed to smoking induced lung cancer) could have conveyed. It's a heroic, well-crafted morality tale, and well deserves its comparison to \"All the President's Men.\" In fact, I think cinematically it is much better.",

Confidential for proof.Mann's use of intense lighting, close-ups and wide landscape shots to establish atmosphere are more refined than in Heat. While most directors either ignore the environment and how it relates to the story or characters, or use it as eye candy, Mann understands the importance of atmosphere. Music, photography, lighting, all can say more in a single scene than most directors can get across in a whole movie.I have to respectfully disagree with Gooch-4 about the lack of focus of the film. The story is about ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. Wigand is the ordinary person thrust into the center of the maelstrom. We need to see Bergman's fight and the corporate happenings to understand the full extent of Wigand's struggle. As to the \"why,\" it seems fairly obvious that Wigand simply set out to do the right thing.",

Will it be an all time classic? No, just for the simple reason that this is a movie made by boys, with boys and for boys. It is pretty much a kind of male fantasy. Apart from the true story of how American tobacco was exposed, the main concern of the movie is male friendship. The film miserably fails the Bechdel test - there is not a single scene in the movie with two women having any kind of conversation. Well there are a couple of very brief scenes with Russell Crowe's wife and daughters talking to each other, but guess what, they're literally muted - you can't hear what they're saying. There are actually only a few minutes in a nearly 3 hour long film where you even have women at all on screen and talking. Crowe's wife is portrayed as a whining ungrateful housewife.  There's an attractive young woman working at CBS, who appears to be nothing more than Pacino's flunky. She has no character to speak of, and all she does is follow Pacino's barked instructions, even when he phones her up in the middle of the night. But I suppose she does provide a bit of eye candy here and there (she is wearing full make up and deshabille when Pacino's call wakes her in the middle of the night). Pacino's wife, again a very tiny part, is the only sympathetic female in the movie, and all she does is basically look adoringly at him and support him when things are going wrong.  She does seem to have a job, though it's not revealed what she does. I am sure there were women involved in all sorts of ways in the original true story, and there could have been all sorts of ways of bringing them into the story, but Mann (appropriate name, btw), chooses not to. As, I say, it's a boys' story. I am looking back on this from 23 years on, and some might say, oh, that's just how things were in Hollywood back then, and there is a smidgeon of truth in that, but really not that much. A quick google shows 1999 movies like The Virgin Suicides, Girl Interrupted, Boys Don't Cry, Election. Even in 1999 Mann was a bit of a dinosaur. I also just rewatched Heat, which is also regarded as a great classic, and I really don't know why. It's just the same: blokes, blokes and more blokes, shouting at each other, bromancing, fighting and punching, making phone calls, giving long brooding looks.",

Very few films fit that discription. The true story and the article that The Insider is based on is so fundamental that it has lead to a radical worldwide change in how a certain product is produced, or at least distributed, and even the film alone made its contribution in this matter. In addition the plot is a dive into the ruthlessness of big business and media corporations, where the situation has become even worse since then. This makes it not just a film drama, but also a historical document. Regardless of this, when the performances from top and well known actors are at such a level that you forget that its not reality you're watching, but actualy just a fictiionalized version of it, that's when film making is where it ideally should be. Then it becomes magic, and director Michael Mann and his crew must certainly have felt this during the rehersals and shootings. Main role holder Russell Crowe probably does his best ever performance, so credible that we forget that he is acting. He truly becomes the character, something that always is prior for making the best films. Even Al Pacino, who usually delivers some ultimate version of himself, steps out and into this bubble, and the interaction between him and Crowe is outstanding. It's all so convincing that the late Christopher Plummer just might fool you to believe that it really is Mike Wallace playing himself. On top of that Bruce McGill has a verbal anger outburst so convincing that the actors receiving it literally get scared. Also Mike Moore becomes a good actor by playing himself. All in all there is nothing negative to say about this film, and it gets even better the second time around.",

They certainly make it seem like there\u2019s some significant danger for the main characters. I think the primary reason that I found the film a bit underwhelming was simply because it didn\u2019t feel like the stakes were as high as the movie was implying. Yes, the men involved faced severe opposition and standing up to the tobacco industry caused them great personal frustration. But it never seemed their lives were in danger. Likewise, the content of their \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d story is such old news to me, and I struggle to understand why it mattered so much. Was it really that shocking to people in 1996 that cigarette corporations knew their products were life-threatening and that they actively worked to make them more addictive? I was in my late teens at that time, and I\u2019m pretty sure that I assumed all of this was true. Despite all of my issues, when I was able to go with the flow and accept the story of The Insider as a high stakes endeavor, I found some enjoyment from it. The tone and atmosphere is excellent and offers plenty of nervous tension throughout. I appreciated the performance of Al Pacino, because he isn\u2019t over-the-top and crazy like he has become in many modern movies. I do wish they had cast someone more charismatic and interesting than Russell Crowe to play the lead role. However after watching the actual interview, it doesn\u2019t seem like Wigand is all that exciting, so perhaps Crowe was delivering the performance just right. Which brings me to my other important positive about The Insider. It was not a perfect movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it did interest me enough that I made a point of seeking out the original video of WIgand\u2019s 60 Minutes interview. I suppose, for a movie based on a true story, that\u2019s a big win. The Insider might have lacked something for me, but at least I was intrigued.",

This movie is of major interest because Pacino plays a News producer for 60 minutes trying to expose the tobacco industry. Funny, because tobacco is probably what made Pacino's voice so gravelly! That's cool he could separate his work from his personal habits. Crowe was nominated for best actor, didn't win-though I hear he's good in Unhinged, we'll see if they nominate him. Should they even have an Oscars for 2020? I don't care never watch it anyway (see post below-I hate high society)",

More specifically, the film is about corporate greed and the sacrifices that individuals are willing to make for the greater cause.  While the movie undoubtedly has an important message and story to share, it is hindered by its length, clocking in at twenty minutes shy of three hours. It could have been trimmed significantly (the first fifteen minutes or so add nothing to the story, for example) without decreasing the impact.  There are also several odd directorial decisions by Mann.  In one scene, litigators approach the courthouse, but a quarter of the screen is obscured by an out of focus newspaper box.  Despite these criticisms, the film is worth watching for its message and for powerful performances from top to bottom.",

            "content": "Michael Mann in full command of his directorial craft.\n\nMichael Mann's political legal drama The Insider (1999) is a testament to Mann's skillful prowess as an American auteur. Mann directs The Insider with an inspiring sense of justice and sensitivity towards his subject Jeffrey Wigand. Mann's riveting direction keeps you stunned, shocked, nervous, and furious at how big tobacco companies operate and intimate witnesses testifying against their unethical behaviors that kill people. The Insider will surely be remembered alongside other phenomenal classics of the investigative, legal drama and paranoia thriller genres like All the President's Men, Zodiac, Spotlight, or Dark Waters. \n\nRussell Crowe is sympathetic and powerful playing a middle aged man in his youth with neat grey hair dye. Crowe conveys his paranoia, frustration, rage, warmth, intelligence, and fear with equal sincerity and kindness towards the patriotic hero and tobacco whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand. Crowe is at the top of his game in a peak performance from this acting legend.\n\nAl Pacino is outstanding as Lowell Bergman, a fierce CBS producer for 60 minutes, who bravely stands behind Wigand and against CBS' cowardly tactics to bury an imperative story for the safety of Americans everywhere. Pacino's persistent rage and righteous indignation admirably defends the virtues of the media as the protectors of American society in their role as the fourth estate. On the other hand, Christopher Plummer adeptly portrays Mike Wallace in his straightforward journalism and cowardice in not defending Wigand when he needed him. The Insider makes Wallace look terribly selfish and only concerned with his career legacy, now tarnished by his own miserable choices.\n\nDiane Venora is hurtful as Liane Wigand, who cannot bring herself to stop acting like an entitled rich housewife long enough to support her husband during his time of need. Venora perfectly captures her selfish decisions. Opposite, we have Lindsay Crouse as Pacino's steadfast and supportive wife, desperately trying to contend with his stubborn ways and searing situation. I liked Debi Mazar as Debbie De Luca the researcher for Pacino. I wish she was in The Insider more as she's hauntingly beautiful and commands your attention any time she speaks or glances over.\n\nBruce McGill is poignant as Ron Motley in a sturdy role of robust accusatory speeches. On the other side of journalism, Philip Baker Hall depicts CBS' boss Don Hewitt as a cowardly traitor taking money from big tobacco in unethical conduct. Stephen Tobolowsky, Gina Gershon, Michael Gambon, Rip Torn, and Cliff Curtis all have memorable cameos that leave a mark in your brain. \n\nEric Roth and Michael Mann's script is poignant, well researched, mature, and informative with a deep empathy for the victims of big tobacco's endless campaign to stop whistleblowers. Dante Spinotti's cinematography is gorgeous and breathtaking, whether shooting a blue ocean or black night in a parking lot. You are held in silent suspense by his isolating shot framing. Lisa Gerrard and Pieter Bourke's score is chilling with ambient noises, holy choirs, and soft acoustic melodies. Bill Myer's realistic make-up goes a long way for The Insider's verisimilitude. \n\nIn all, The Insider will stay in my mind forever as an important film and special classic drama from Michael Mann.",

            "content": "This may very well be the most effective and well-made 'expos\u00e9/whistleblower' film ever made, period. The story focuses less on documenting a grand conspiracy to suppress a larger truth from an omniscient perspective, but instead allows its story to be told through the eyes of 'boots-on-the-ground' characters, allowing the twists of the narrative to impact the viewer more personally. Having coincidentally also recently seen Mann's Public Enemies, on which he shares a similar combination role of director, producer, and writer, there is a unique element to his filmmaking that deserves mention: his willingness to introduce characters, provide development to them, and give them an impactful role in the story, and then to allow them to fall away without any grand resolution to their particular arc, which I feel is more representative of reality than giving every John and Jane some sort of bow-on-top independent story. He's not afraid to recruit quality talent for these roles, either. For an example of this type of character, look no further than Bruce McGill, who delivers one of the most dramatically constructed speeches of the film, but probably sees less than 30 or 40 minutes of screentime elapse between his first and last appearance. Gambon arguably serves as the most prominent antagonist in the film, but is shown sparingly and his ultimate fate is never commented on. Great performance from Crowe, but I'm less confident that Pacino really embraces his characters as much as he just alters the volume of his voice once in a while. Given that the era of corporate deception, whistleblowers, and gag orders has persisted without flagging to the present day, The Insider still feels fresh and relevant. (4.5/5)",

            "content": "Possibly the most famous modern film to explore journalistic ethics is All the President's Men (1976) a stolid attempt at a thriller that never quite convinces it's audiences of it's convictions. I personally did not like the film and when I chose to watch this film, aware that it had many similarities to that film, I hoped to see Michael Mann put his own unique spin on ground covered in many other Hollywood films. Fortunately I was not disappointed as while the film is slow, contemplative and deathly serious it gives you a sense of the impact that whistleblowing can have on both journalists and the whistleblowers themselves much better than the more staid Alan J. Pakula did. This may be Mann's best film as he wrestles with serious themes while making a seriously entertaining and consistently tense film.\n\nScientist Jeffrey Wigand, Russell Crowe, was employed as an executive at Big Tobacco corporation Brown & Williamson and is now willing to reveal information that would force the CEOs of the major tobacco companies to admit that they know the negative effect that cigarettes have on people. Lowell Bergman, Al Pacino, who serves as the producer of 60 Minutes attempts to coax this information out of him as Wigand's difficult personality and the breakup of his marriage complicate their interactions. A further issue is the fact that Wigand had signed a confidentiality agreement which would legally prevent him from revealing the information to the public. A segment with popular news presenter Mike Wallace, Christopher Plummer, is taped but CBS refuses to run the segment under the guise of concern about the legal repercussions they could face but most likely because they want to be bought by Westinghouse, who own Brown & Williamson, in a corporate merger. In the aftermath of this event Wigand spirals out of control while Bergman desperately tries to contact him and have the information released to the public.\n\nThe film pulls the risky move of having it's perspective shift midway through the film as it turns from being a Wigand-centric film to a movie primarily concerned with journalistic ethics and Bergman's fight to have them upheld. This is where the film becomes most interesting as while the first half engages you with it's tale of Bergman slowly extracting information from an emotionally fraught Wigand the threats do not really come into play until the second act. It is there that we get a wonderful sequence that is able to plunge into the depths of despair and loss as Wigand's sacrifices have seemingly amounted to nothing while he stands alone. These are the sort of scenes we never got in similarly themed journalism movies as there is plenty of ranting and raving about the fear of losing money and the stresses it places on family members but the impact of this loss is rarely captured so closely. Mann intelligently throws all the facts that we need to know at us in the first half and then leaves us with the characters that have been slowly built up with their tensions boiling over and conflicts coming to play.\n\nMann also has the benefit of working with a stellar cast as Crowe and Pacino are reliably magnetic but Diane Venora and Plummer steal scenes in the background and add depth to characters that need to be more than plain caricature. Pacino, who I believe to be the true lead of the film, could be accused of going too far but it is fun to watch him chew scenery and here he works with a part that asks him to hold real convictions and provides him with lines worthy of an actor of his stature. Crowe is well cast as a tortured, obsessive man as he plays socially inept and volatile much better than he would in A Beautiful Mind (2001). Here he feels like a man who has lived a regular life for a long time with his personality defects only really causing problems every now and then but creating a sudden implosion for him now. One has to wonder how Plummer, a highly respected actor who would eventually get his due, was not nominated for Best Supporting Actor with competition as weak as Jude Law in The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999).\n\nThis isn't necessarily a film that will have fans of Miami Vice excited but for those who enjoy thrillers and films with something to say about the state of news media this will be a wholly satisfying experience.",

Michael Mann has done us all a great service by taking this shameful but true story,  with huge consequences for society, and turning it into a riveting thriller and a nuanced human drama. The editing, music and lighting work beautifully, and the dialogue feels genuine and hits hard.  Crowe is outstanding, Plummer leads a great supporting cast, and Al Pacino delivers an excellent and overlooked performance as the movie's protagonist.",

            "content": "As a film maker and huge mega fan of the industry, I am gobsmacked at what I just witnessed. The fact that it took me this long to even hear about, let alone witness a film of this calibre is baffling. I've loved pretty much everything Michael Mann has ever achieved with his directorial career, but here, he just creates this piece of entertainment that is raw and calculated and all sorts of grandiose that, I can confidently say, I've never ever seen anything quite like The Insider. Instead of his usual crime or thriller genre pick, Mann here decides to go for a true life story and biopic of fresh and epic proportions. Lowell Berman, is a CBS producer, on one of Americas biggest news shows, 60 Minutes. After returning from Tehran on a recent story, he stumbles across an obscure story of a man name Jeff Wigand, a former scientist and consultant for a massive tobacco company, who recently has just been fired, on false terms and he has some very big news. However when the tobacco company find out that their reputation and lively hoods are on the line, with Wigands secrets, not only can CBS not get enough of his story, but his life becomes threatened and family life destroyed, as the whistle blower, tries to do whats right. This film is a masterpiece, on so many levels. The cast, what a cast, Al Pacino, Russell Crowe, Rip Torn, Christopher Plummer and Michael Gambon make up just a portion of raw talent in this film and every single one of them are completely on top form, all off them, not a bad apple in the bunch. Every actor in the film lives their character and being a strong minded director about character and visualisation, Mann orchestrates this ensemble wonderfully, with time and consideration. Pacino is on fire as CBS producer Lowell, his drive, his motivation to get the truth out there is overwhelming, he delivers such a sense of emotion and passion, I actually think, this could be one of Pacino's finest moments. Crowe is just outstanding as Wigand, the man with everything to lose, his multi layered character is a sight to behold, as his family life is turned upside down and his past trudged through the mood. Equally Michael Gambon as the head of the large tobacco company, regardless of his limited screen time, is just out of this universe, he emits so much threat, so much evil and snide intentions, that his entire scene is edge of your seat, jaw dropping. And Christopher Plumber, oh my god, he just steals the screen, every single moment he is on it, literally chews it up and spits it out. He revels in every moment and his chemistry with Pacino is awe inspiring. The script is so well written, its engaging, thematic, arcing, tension filled,dialogue is real and passionate. There isnt a single flaw in any of it, its all required, it gives just the right amount of exposition, when it needs to and never more, leaving the story building and building, till our hearts cant take it any more. The actors deliver their characters and dialogue flawlessly and extra gratitude to Mann for clearly allowing these guys to go the full mile, it pays off in  every respect. The visual element, although not quite as flashy as his other work, is expertly crafted, with a wide range of colour palette and lighting. The way in which the sequences are crafted and edited together are kinetic and hypnotising, every single conversation, and there are a lot of them, just brings something new and stylistic to the table. The look and feel consistantly follow the themes and tones of whats going on, extreme close ups are used to wonderful effect, making us feel claustrophobic at times, putting us right where we want to be in the film. I havent seen this kind of cinematography ever and its wonderful, seemless and downright admirable. The use of music and choice of music is spot on, the soundtrack and score just resonate with your emotions, they pull even more out of the content, giving you a real sense of threat and helplessness as this entire debacle explodes over everyones face. Its polished, well directed, acted, producer, edited, filmed, the story is so rich with content and an utter joy to watch unravel. I literally fell deeper and deeper into every second of this film, torn apart by what was happening and transfixed on the screen, all the time. How often do you get that in a film? Not often enough, and missing this film, if you have any remote interest in the art form is a collosal mistake. It has such much texture, so much style and finesse, that it has now became one of my all time favorite films. I have nothing bad to say, its not over bloated, despite glancing over its run time, it doesnt bore, it never takes its foot of the pedal and it hits every mark it sets out to. I cant think of one thing at all to critize, and at is an achievement. If you havent seen this film, get on it right now.",

But this film shows that he doesn't have to.\n\nOne of the most exciting scenes of the film is two actors simply faxing back and forth. There's no dialogue, little music, and no complex editing. But the tension created by Mann keeps your eyes glued to the screen.\n\nCrowe, Pacino, Plummer, and Gambon are all brilliant in their roles, but a good actor isn't worth much without a good film to act in, and this is most certainly a film that goes above and beyond good.\n\nThis is a master class thriller that I've put off seeing for far too long.

            "content": "The epic rise of Russell Crowe in his winning streak of Oscar nominated films begins in this expertly crafted and intelligently directed thriller. Michael Mann directs an excellent, very urgent and powerful thriller that has a lot on its mind and is filled with excellent performances from a very expansive and brilliant cast. The way everything develops in this paranoid thriller is excellent and it all moves at a fiery pace, the script is excellent at being intelligent whilst also developing its characters very well, which is the one element most films of this type seem to forget. It's scary to see how far a business will go to protect its secrets, which is why it is probably easier to just keep them hired.\n\nThe acting in this film is outstanding with everyone giving it their all. I'm a little surprised by the amount of awards Crowe was nominated for, not because he was bad, on the contrary, he gave a very realistic performance, but it's just that he was in the film for what felt like considerably less time than Al Pacino. Then again, it's hardly like he was in a supporting role, so it makes sense. Al Pacino gave a very passionate performance and felt like he was very involved with what was going on, as did veteran Christopher Plummer and wow, speaking of Plummer, he is amazing, give that guy a great script and he does absolute wonders with it, he was very exciting to watch, even if Pacino and Plummer didn't have accents but maybe they weren't supposed to, I'm not sure, another veteran actor Phillip Baker Hall does a good job as well. The only real problem I had with the acting was Michael Gambon, while he is an excellent character actor and still did a good job here, I can't ignore his dreadful accent in this film, if it's what's the real person is reported to have sounded like, then fine, but any time he spoke it just sounded like he was drunk.\n\nThe script is, like I said, excellent and develops the story in a very realistic way but I really loved how they developed the characters. Crowe's character, Jeffery Wigand, is given so many little nuances and little remarks when he talks to his daughters or students that it just makes it so real and really, really likeable. I really felt for his character and he was immediately sympathetic, thanks in part, again, to an excellent performance from Russell Crowe. Looking at the poster, I thought Pacino would be going against Crowe and would be trying to stop him and I am very surprised with what happened; it's refreshing to see something so different- showcasing people fighting for the truth. I also thought that in the interview they would hide his face behind a bug sheet of cardboard like I have seen in other films. As is the norm for a Michael Mann film, the technicals are all amazing, the film looked and sounded excellent; the soundtrack is very varied and excellent to listen to and the film looks absolutely amazing. I could watch Russell Crowe play in the driving range all night because of how beautiful that scene looked and if Michael Mann is the director, there is no question about it and it's certainly one of the best films he has directed, it's a very different style of film for him as well. This film was also made very quickly after the real event and I bet Michael Mann was pleased when he got the rights to make this, the TV version of the film is longer than the theatrical one, too, not all that sure why though. 'The Insider', or the more fitting originally titled, 'Man Of The People', the other title is still great as well, is smart, intense, thoughtful, political and all without firing a gun, now that's the way to do a thriller.",

Russell Crowe is Jeffrey Wigand; the whistleblower for a major tobacco company, who appears on the CBS investigative news program \"60 Minutes,\" to detail how chemicals are used in the product to enhance a nicotine addiction. Corporate pressure, as the result of possible litigation, forces the segment to air in modified form. Al Pacino is the news producer Lowell Bergman, who repeatedly informs his sources that they have his word that he will protect them. Michael Mann directed and co-wrote the script with Eric Roth. This is among the most intelligent depictions of journalism since \"All the President's Men.\" In the first hour, the story revolves around Crowe's hesitation about whether or not to do the interview, but in the second hour it shifts to focus on how financial implications can affect journalistic integrity. Bergman is credited as a consultant on the movie, so it is slanted to give him a favorable portrayal as the only journalist with integrity, while his colleagues are portrayed as sell-outs. It appears to be a somewhat distorted view that is hard to accept. Crowe is less physically imposing here, but he is just as commanding and more subtle than usual. He often presses his forefinger against his nose to adjust his glasses. Pacino is forceful without the histrionics. Christopher Plummer is masterly as an arrogant Mike Wallace. With Philip Baker Hall as Don Hewitt, Diane Venora, Lindsay Crouse, Debi Mazar, Bruce McGill, Michael Gambon, Stephen Tobolowsky, Gina Gershon.",

I felt that Russell Crowe's portrayal as Jeffrey Wigand was a bit amiss as he was a bit wooden and reserved, save for some emotional outbursts (but that's Crowe in a nutshell).

Crowe really digs in here and portrays Jeff Wigand with all of his contradictions, he is so good here. Then we have Pacino at his shouty best (fav scene has to be Pacino unloading at the hotel guy on the phone) who lays out cold the complex and corrupted corporate worlds that the story is based around.

            "content": "The Insider sounded great on the surface simply because it is an Al Pacino film, and finding out that it was Russell Crowe's international breakthrough performance which scored him an Academy Award nomination was just a perfect touch.\n\nAs well as being a long film, The Insider also maintains a rather slow pace over the course of its 157 minute running time which many audiences may find alienates them from maintaining interest constantly for so long. It is the serious audiences that can really appreciate it the whole time, and so if you are serious about good cinema then you should most definitely view The Insider.\nI am extremely happy that I did, because I found the film to be excellent. I did find it long and relatively slow, but I found that these elements were overshadowed by the significantly more positive elements of the film.\nMichael Mann's directional skill is at some of his best in The Insider. He goes deep inside the story and harnesses the true nature of its dramatics, excellently conveying just what enables the story to be such a thrilling one. It examines the events in the story from various perspectives, such as how it affects its characters directly has humans, the outcry that it causes on the world and just how it changes the perception of living in a universe that always favours having its people speak out against crimes. It reveals the big hypocrisy of free speech and makes audiences question if there really even is such as thing. The Insider is an incredibly intelligent drama which takes full advantage of its excellent script and turns it into the compelling and inspirational film that it deserves to be. Michael Mann manages to keep the theme of tobacco on a professional level without turning The Insider into some self-indulgent excuse for him to make a personal criticism of it, something that Oliver Stone could never do. So if Oliver Stone has two Academy Awards and Michael Mann has none, that is just ridiculous.\nThe Insider captures the true drama that it reaches for and becomes so realistic that I naturally forgot that I was watching a film as the experience unfolded before my eyes. And at the same time, I felt all the thrills of the situation. The Insider is an incredibly thrilling film and it captures the essence of drama that comes with facing massive corporations in a world dominated mostly by such corporations. And honestly, it is easy for The Insider to appeal to viewers because we have all felt at times like we have wanted to change the world but like there is someone or something out there that refuses to let us, and the true story roots behind The Insider make it all the more compelling. The true cheering inspiration behind The Insider is undeniable, and since it is a story that truly needed to be told it is excellent that Michael Mann is the man for the job. He gives it the treatment it truly deserves and intensifies it to points you would not expect. The drama in the story will seep into you and tug you from the inside, and it is a hell of a feeling. The experience of watching The Insider is one that everyone should really feel, and the kind of dramatic power that Michael Mann hands over is just incredible. His direction is at an all time best on The Insider, and he proves once again to be able to bring out the best in his cast.\nThe Insider provides a serious opportunity for Russell Crowe, because it puts him in the role of the history changing hero Jeffrey Wigand despite being not such a well known actor at the time. The man who would win the Academy Award for Best Actor the following year for his lead performance in Gladiator takes the chance and runs with it, giving it his all and making it one of his most brilliant performances to date. Instead of characterising Jeffrey Wigand as a man who won't back down, he characterises him as the realistic person that he was, and he does this through incorporating in the humanistic elements of the character which include his fear and anxiety. You can see the tension in his mind gradually develop as the story becomes more and more dramatic, and there is not a second that his dramatic talents as an actor fail to deliver on their powerful strength, and The Insider proves to the world what so many Australians knew years ago when they saw his incredible lead performance in Romper Stomper. The Insider features some of his surely greatest skills as an actor, and his lead performance is an undeniably stunning and ambitious lead which is captivating to everyone when he is on the screen. Anyone unsure of Russell Crowe's talents as an actor can look at him in The Insider and be sure that he knows what he is doing.\nAl Pacino gives a brilliant performance in The Insider. He is one of my all time favourite actors so I expected no less from him, and he completely delivered on that promised because in The Outsider he gives it his all and delivers one of his most undoubtedly excellent performances to never have nominated for an Academy Award which is crap because he really deserved a nomination for Best Supporting actor for his performance in The Insider. Despite being up against an exceptional performance by Russell Crowe, Al Pacino's many decades of acting have been building up his skills more and more. And he proves it that in his role in The Insider he refuses to back down. His performance is a restrained one which doesn't go over the top so that he uses intimidation as a tactic, when in actual fact he keeps a simple humanity and realism in his characterisation of Lowell Bergman. It is a role not too much like anything he has faced before, and it proves to be the furthest thing from a challenge for him because Al Pacino's exceptional acting talent and natural charisma make him flawless in The Insider. He really deserved an Academy Award nomination for his performance.\nThe supporting performances of Phillip Baker Hall and Christopher Plummer also provide excellent support to the film, and Diane Venora makes a dramatic impact as well. The small role portrayed by Renee Olstead is a nice touch as well.\nLastly, the visual style of the film makes it more intense because it has a lot of claustrophobic cinematography which captures the flawlessly convincing production design very nicely, and combined with a powerful musical score, The Insider is an atmospheric experience in every angle.\n\nSo in the end, The Insider has a hell of a story which is told through a combination of excellent script, powerful acting and the greatest skills as a director that Michael Mann can offer.",

            "content": "Not a Movie For Smokers\ntrevsreviews.wordpress.com\n\nMichael Mann's The Insider (1999) follows the story of Jeffery Wigand, a research chemist who has just been fired from a major tobacco company, and 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman, who is driven to release the truth about the tobacco company's \"hidden agendas.\" Al Pacino is great as always playing the producer, but it's Russell Crowe who really shines. The 35 year old actor (at the time) plays 50+ year old Jeffery Wigand in a transformational performance that's been easily over looked with credits such as Gladiator, A Beautiful Mind, and Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World following it. Playing the late 60 Minutes host Mike Wallace is the terrific Christopher Plummer (who surprising looks a lot like the real person).\n\nGoing into the film, I had my reservations. Even though Michael Mann has been adored by critics, I've only been exposed to the lack luster Miami Vice and the disappointing Public Enemies which tarnished my opinion of him (I've also seen Mann's Collateral which I thoroughly enjoyed). However, The Insider changed my view of the director. This film is gripping, thought provoking, and uniquely suspenseful.\n\nNot only are the performances strong, but the muted cinematography is brilliant. The film is in color, but, as I look back on it, I see the film in black and white oddly enough. (or I just might be going crazy). The desaturated images creatively coincide with the dark, eerie tone of the film. In relation with the cinematography, the lighting is beautiful. I distinctly remember the key interview Jeffery Wigand has with Mike Wallace where Wigand's face is half in the light and half in the dark. This intriguing lighting choice effectively portrays the emotional uncertainty behind Jeffery Wigand; half of him wants to stay in the dark and not break his confidentiality agreement and the other half wants to bring the truth to the light.\n\n   The Insider is very dialogue heavy which may turn off some viewers, and the pacing is long and slow at times. The film clocks in at 2 hours and 37 minutes, which towards the end feels like you've been sitting on your couch for days.\n\nDespite the minor flaws, The Insider succeeds in providing gritty insight into big, powerful tobacco companies and the measures they will go to keep their secrets from being exposed. I highly recommend this film if you've enjoyed the classic All the President's Men or the underrated Michael Clayton. The Insider is rather unknown after being nominated for seven Academy Awards and walking away with nothing once American Beauty took everything by storm. However, I encourage people to seek this film out and, if you have the patience, immerse yourself in this highly intelligent and well crafted film.",

The Insider is an engaging, beautifully-paced corporate thriller that leaves most others like it looking silly and amateurish. This is a war movie. The big strikes are lawsuits. The battlefield is the conscience. And the heroes put themselves on the front lines for the sake of the truth. Despite having no action scenes, a 2.5 hour running time, and based around the tired subject of tobacco, The Insider manages to be one of -- if not the best corporate thriller of all time. Fascinating whistleblower story for older teens. A sobering examination of corruption, courage, cowardice, and the sometimes catastrophic costs of telling the truth. Not only is the story fascinating and intelligent...and not only is Michael Mann's directing inventive and yet down to earth, but the performances by the cast are truly excellent. this is a excellent film i recommend everyone who have not watched this film please watch it. The Insider is a edge of your seat thriller which pitted an ordinary man against big businesses.",

It's always interesting to watch A-listers playing real people and not just a \"character\". The story was interesting, the intrigue was delicious and the struggle was just heart-breaking. Unfortunately, after all the heartache and their valiant efforts it just seems that it was all for naught because even though there was a posting after the  film *****SPOILER ALERT***** that the big tobacco companies were successfully sued and had to pay billions of dollars in class action law suits; it just doesn't seem to make a difference now, tobacco is still big business and I'm sure the companies are still setting record-profits, many people still smoke and at younger age. It seems all the efforts done in order to curb societies addiction to smoking has failed. As noble as this film's intentions were, it's just too little too late.",

Some would argue that Crowe's best performances can be seen in other films like \"Gladiator\" or \"A Beautiful Mind,\" but I would argue that his role in \"The Insider\" is his best thus far as his performance showcases the physical and emotional impact that Wigand goes through as the movie progresses. Plummer does a fantastic job by capturing the essence of \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Mike Wallace. Bruce McGill, Michael Gambon and Colm Feroe are good in small, but important supporting roles. The performances aren't the only thing that elevates \"The Insider.\" Mann brings his signature directional style to life thanks to cinematographer Dante Spinotti as this film is filled with a variety of effective camera angles complete with indirect focus and intense close-ups.",

It does take it's sweet time to get going, but once it does. it becomes quite gripping and it shows all the corruption at the top of big business. When Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) is fired from his job at Brown & Williamson Tobacco, he is approached by CBS News producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) to help clarify information regarding tobacco company Philip Morris, Wigand refuses because of a confidentiality agreement. Smelling a rat, Bergman asks for Wigand to go on the record and expose what really goes on behind the scenes at the big tobacco companies, and to be interviewed for CBS's 60 Minutes by Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer). Wigand is relucatant, and he and his family gets death threats, but the tobacco companies aren't happy, but Bergman won't give in. Once it gets to the interview and the chicanery to try and have it stopped, it perks up and becomes quite gripping, but it's quite a build up.

The initial reason for dismissal was because of poor communication between himself and others at his workplace, although it actually otherwise. It is actually due to him knowing the contents of the produced tobacco products which included a lethal chemical called \"coumarin\" which was neglected to be acknowledged from the company and telling his bosses about that. A reporter named Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) from the TV show \"60 Minutes\" approaches him to describe his findings and whistleblowing of the tobacco company and do on air interview with Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer). He reluctantly does, but it comes at many costs and puts his life surprisingly in danger and \"60 Minutes\" in hot water.\r\n\r\nFascinating drama that shows Wingand as one of the few prolific individuals to come and rat on a company who was doing dangerous things to make a buck and at the same time, putting people's lives at risk even further (not cigarettes were bad for you anyway). Everyone in their performances are good and so is the story, as it even has greater relevance to me since I learned a lot about this in university since I am a business graduate (integrity is a major player for those majoring in accounting). I do have a hard time believing that the actual players in this scandal were extensive users of profanities. That seemed over dramatized (and a bit indulgent). Other than that one minor deficiency, it is still really fine film. Nice parallel with the news story of the legendary criminal, \"The Unibomber.\"",

This is a drama that takes its time, and gives us an ending that's up to the viewer to decide; it's either a big payoff, or a letdown.  For me, it doesn't matter.\n\tJeffrey Wigand (Crowe) is a tobacco scientist and researcher that is abruptly fired from his job at cigarette company, Brown and Williamson.  It's instantly impossible for his family to adjust, and Wigand takes up teaching chemistry and Japanese at his high school, though he's still confused and upset.  His inconclusive story comes into contact with \"60 Minutes\" producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), who approaches Wigand to give the scoop on what the tobacco companies are keeping from their consumers.  Wigand agrees, but as soon as he films the interview, not only is it not able to air due to lawsuit, but there's even more than meets the eye.\n\tFilmed at the height of the paranoia of the dangers of cigarettes, \"The Insider\" is still relevant today, giving us an inside (and often ugly) look at office life, celebrity, and a faltering marriage.  It's often a lot to take, but it's simply impossible to look away.  Mann has created one of his best films here, and it's certainly deserving of its seven Oscar nominations.\n\tClaustrophobia is the key to making this film so great, and Mann flaunts it.  The story is told from Bergman's point of view; therefore, it's frustrating, suspenseful, and filled to the brim with anger.  At two-and-a-half hours, the film moves along with utter realism, and keeps the viewer trapped in this nightmare just as much as the suffering characters on the inside.\n\tCrowe is riveting; his character is supposedly supposed to be a hero, yet he's so flawed and has made so many mistakes in the past, it makes us wonder.  This is one of his best performances, not necessarily because it's showy, but because he's subdued and provides us with a main character in anguish.  Christopher Plummer as well, keeps our eyes glued to the screen, especially since he portrays Mike Wallace, a man we all know and admire, as a selfish and manipulative boss.  But the real treasure once again is Pacino, who plays a man under so much pressure, so wronged in his life, that you can't help but root for his character, even though he plays a character that we usually hates in movies.  The cast together is simply superb-- it would be even more fair to credit all of them with giving great performances.\n\t\"The Insider\" is compelling and constantly dramatic, the basic ingredients needed to make a great movie.

The movie should have been an hour less long and should have a faster pace in evolvement of what happens, then it might get much better. Here I can rate acting at 9 and the story at 7, but as a whole, the movie just does not speak to me and that is why it gets a lower mark",

The adaptation is smart if not gripping and well edited for the most part of the drama is drawn out from the conversation that resonates too much practicality which helps the feature keep it grounded. Michael Mann is no short on execution and is not only supported but celebrated with the help of amazing cinematography and brilliant background score. The feature scores on high pitches through performance and the strength of the star cast like Russell Crowe, Al Pacino, Philip Baker Hall and Christopher Plummer. The Insider is a typical informative feature that is not only accurate but is entertaining and electrifying too that keeps the audience engaged through its 157 minutes of runtime where one cannot not be moved by these pragmatic characters.",

The performances of Al Pacino and Crowe are particularly worthy of congratulations, with both actors managing to give substance and soul to their characters. Crowe even stayed some time near the real Dr. Wigand in order to observe his ways, gestures and behavior, which only shows the quality of this actor and the professionalism of his work. The film has a great script, written by Eric Roth and Michael Mann. The story is engaging and \"grab\" the audience from beginning to end. The photograph of the film is also interesting, using light and shadow to thicken or lighten the suspense. Undoubtedly, one of most interesting films of the turn of millennium.",
