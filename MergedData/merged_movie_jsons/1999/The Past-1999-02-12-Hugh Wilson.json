The premise is original and interesting, and I thought the film was engrossing and thoroughly entertaining -- I laughed out loud several times. Brendan Fraser is perfectly cast as the goofy, innocent Adam. Alicia Silverstone is better than she's ever been, I'm certainly no fan of her, but she did a more than okay job in this film. But the really ingenious casting decision was to give the roles of Adam's parents to Sissy Spacek and the always brilliant Christopher Walken -- I dare say that the casting of Spacek and Walken in this film is the _opposite_ of type casting, :-).I really, really liked this film because it is genuinely entertaining, and it is never boring. Brilliant comedy in other words. (8/10)",

            "content": "'Blast From the Past' is a funny little romcom. It's very enjoyable as long as one does not expect anything serious. The plot does follow the romcom clich\u00e9 where dude tries to woo dudette but here the dude was raised all his 35 years in an underground shelter, away from the outer world and that just makes the story funnier. Wilson maintains to sustain the movie's lightness as the screenplay is consistent. Silverstone and Fraser make an odd but fun romantic couple. There's the sweet chemistry. Fraser plays his awkward goofy naive persona that we've seen in a few other films but he still manages to be funny and likable and Silverstone is pretty and charming as she ends up delivering a decent performance. Pity we don't see her much these days. Spacek and Walken are cast against type and I have got to say that they provide some of the laugh out loud moments without going over the top. Of course they play Fraser's parents who have been living underground for the last 35 years. What I also liked about 'Blast From the Past' is that its comedy does not rely on crude humour (unlike most American comedies today). The film does have its downside as I felt it was moving a little slow in the beginning but the fun that I had from watching it made that a minor flaw.",

            "content": "See the movie to find out why, but Brendan Fraser's crazy dad has had him underground for thirty years in an elaborate bomb shelter, so that when Brendan finally goes upstairs in the 90's to get more supplies for his parents, he's in for a bit of a shock.Christopher Walken is wonderful as the crazy, atomic-age inventor. Alicia Silverstone deserves to be on screen more - she's cute and sassy as the love interest, but still pulls funny faces with her mouth. Brendan Fraser was a perfect choice for the biggest fish out of water ever. His fresh-faced naivety is so convincing. He's larger than life, and sometimes so naive its corny, but he's consistent, so it works. Depending on what mood you're in, Sissy Spacek's part adds psychological depth to the movie or detracts a tad from the fun.This movie is not at all implausible. There were many people as scared as Christpher Walken during the 60's. In 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, Kennedy and Khruschev were one button press away from blowing us all to smithereens (see Thirteen Days for a historically accurate portrayal of this). And Walken's character is set up as crazy enough to build and stock his shelter with 30 years worth of supplies.8/10. Terrific fun time-skipping romantic comedy buoyed by the personality of Fraser - perfect to watch with a sweetheart, or with family on a warm weekend in.",

Calvin, a genius scientist from CalTec, is a man that has been preparing for bad times. When the president of the United States, J.F.Kennedy takes to the airwaves to announce an impending clash with the Soviet Union over the missiles in Cuba, Calvin figures this is it! He decides to end the party and he and Helen go to their well prepared and stocked bomb shelter. Little does he know, but the falling of a military jet in the area triggers the lock system and before they realize it, they are trapped in his own invention.Helen gives birth to a boy, who she names Adam. The boy is brought up in their bunker and grows up to be a genius on his own right. Adam grows up listening to old Perry Como's records and can speak several foreign languages his parents have taught him. Adam is a well adjusted young man, after thirty five years on his own, without the prospect of a woman, or love. When the locking mechanism finally frees the family, they are still reluctant to go into the world, something Calvin doesn't want to do, but Helen, wanting Adam to be happy, decides to send him to replenish their dwindling supplies.Of course, Adam, in the real world appears to be a monster. With his old fashioned clothes, his bad haircut, he is a sight not to be believed. Being naive and without malice, he has no idea how the man he proposes to sell his valuable collection of baseball cards is trying to cheat him. Enter Eve, a young woman at the store, who tells Adam the mistake he is making. Adam is lucky to have found his own Eve. Adam doesn't take too long to acquire a taste for everything modern as guided by Eve and her gay brother.Hugh Wilson directed this delightful movie with the right touch, as everything has a light ironic feeling to everything we see. Written by Bill Kelly, the screen play is one of the best things in movies of this genre of the last years.Brendan Fraser, who has played these types of naive characters before, is appealing as Adam. Christopher Walken took a breather from his usual heavy characters and is a winner as Calvin Webber, the genius who was mistaken. Sissy Spacek also seems to be having fun with her Helen. Alicia Silverstone plays Eve, the wise street girl from Pasadena who fell in love with Adam.\"Blast from the Past\" is a film that shows the talents of Hugh Wilson at his best. It will not disappoint!",

            "content": "There surely is a lack of originality in movies now. Romantic comedies always seem to have the girl outwit the guy, the guy persisting, and then they finally get together. That's exactly the case in Blast from the Past, except that the guy has been living in a bomb shelter for all of his life. It's a joke that could work for a five minute sketch, or it might just flop overall, but that's not the case here. It's a simple romantic comedy with a huge twist thrown in, which works to the movie's advantage.Adam (Brendan Fraser) had lived in a fallout shelter for all of his life, because his father (Christopher Walken) thought a nuclear bomb was dropped on the house. 35 years afterwards, Adam goes up to bring supplies and meet a girl, which he does. Eve (Alicia Silverstone) is a feisty, typical 90's American, but since Adam had never met anyone else besides his parents, he just accepts it. Soon he falls in love with her (hence, Adam and Eve), but the reverse is not the same. Will he convince her? Only the clich\u00e9 on romantic comedies will tell us!Blast from the Past is surprisingly lightweight romcom. It never goes to take itself seriously, which helps keep the mood light, which is what it's supposed to be. At times it gets silly, including a Benny Hill-ish chase scene, and the obligatory man-who-can't-drive-car-drives-car-wildly scene. A scenario like this could easily descend into heartstring-plucking land, but thankfully stays on the top, and over the top. Director Hugh Wilson, whose resum\u00e9 includes such movies as the original Police Academy and The First Wives Club, can keep a movie that could turn drastically wrong on the right track.Fraser is great. It really seemed like he was brought up in a fallout shelter. His mannerisms were all from the sixties, and the way he acted was exactly on key. Silverstone was okay, but nowhere near as good as Walken and Sissy Spacek as Adam's parents. They embody their roles as people who have to live in the same space for 35 years. This movie is everything romantic comedies today don't have: no crude humor, funny lines, good acting, and a fun story. People could really learn a lesson from watching Blast from the Past.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for brief language, sex and drug references.",

When something doesn't ring true, when it's contrived and phony, they react harshly.Europeans also despise American \"heart warming\" anything... They simply aren't as optimistic as we are, and hence don't believe in so many happy endings.Now, despite all this, Blast From The Past, a movie that is immersed in charm, style and wit, without ever resorting to bathroom humor, passed with flying colors. This is a movie whose charm cannot be overstated. It is a triumph of film making.You probably know the general story: Brendan Fraser's parents hid in their backyard fallout shelter when they feared the Cuban missile crisis was about to explode (bad pun). Thirty five years later, Brendan is sent out in the world to bring back supplies. He is told the world will be full of death, decay, misery, and probably mutants.Whoops. Guess not.Brendan starts out like a lost puppy dog, but thanks to a skillful screenplay, great acting and directing, he never becomes an object of ridicule. He is simply inexperienced and pure of heart. After all, he's been living apart from society his whole life. We have to give him a break.What sets this movie apart is how it doesn't run scared from \"what if\" scenarios. For example, in lesser hands this might have degenerated into some sappy, forgettable comedy. But everyone involved seems to have been on the top of their game. It's like a jigsaw puzzle and all the pieces fit together flawlessly. This movie doesn't coldly and calculatingly create warmth and charm; it simply possesses it...in abundance, like a priceless work of art that seems more discovered than created.I have never met anyone who didn't like this movie. I am really surprised the overall rating isn't higher. Under no circumstances could I imagine giving this movie less than an 8.My rating is a 10, because 11 is off the scale.I wish more Hollywood movies were like this.P.S.

So in order to prepare for it he abandons his academic work at Cal Tech and secretly builds a fallout shelter in his own back yard. Then, during the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, he and his pregnant wife, \"Helen\" (Sissy Spacek), relocate into it as a precaution. As luck would have it, a jet just so happens to run out of fuel and subsequently crashes right above them. This causes Calvin to believe a nuclear strike has occurred and because of that he locks himself and Helen into the fallout shelter for a period of about 35 years. And then he opens the doors... Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, despite some obvious weaknesses here and there, I found this movie to be extremely hilarious! Not only does Christopher Walken perform in an exceptionally superb manner but I also liked the acting of Brandon Frasier (as \"Adam\") along with David Foley (\"Troy\") and the \"Arch Bishop\" (Joey Slotnick). Likewise, the presence of Alicia Silverstone (as \"Eve\") certainly didn't hurt. In any case, I liked this movie and I recommend it to anyone looking for a first-rate comedy of this type.

A lot of those people had visions of living in an atomic shelter for the next three to four decades, perhaps even longer and not being able to see the daylight ever again. Well, it may never have happened, but this romantic comedy shows us what it must be like.\"Blast from the Past\" tells the story of Adam Weber. In the 1960's, during the Cuba crisis, his parents locked themselves in the bomb shelter which his eccentric father had constructed for just in case. Having been locked for 35 years, Adam has never seen anything else but the confined space of the shelter. He has never seen anything of the world and has become a very naive man. Now, the doors are unlocked and Adam must venture out into LA to find food and supplies for his family and a non-mutant wife for himself...Romantic comedies can be found in many forms, but this sure was one of the more original ones. And I must say that I liked it. The acting for instance is more than OK. I liked Brendan Fraser as the naive Adam and together with Alicia Silverstone he forms a nice couple in this movie. Even though the entire story could have used a little bit more developing, overall it looks good and offers some good laughs and plenty of fun for the people who like romantic comedies.

            "review_title": "What a \"Blast!\"",
            "content": "Not only have \"The First Wives Club\" film director Hugh Wilson and freshman scenarist Bill Kelly injected new life into a timeworn tale of initiation (it's about a young man's rites of passage into an evil, corrupt, decadent urban society), but they have also tweaked the formula in several refreshing ways. Happily, \"Blast from the Past\" refrains from portraying its gullible, time-warped protagonist as the butt of every prankster's joke. Although he played the same role in \"Encino Man,\" Brendan Fraser of \"George of the Jungle\" and \"Airheads\" manages to imbue this farcical but sympathetic na\u00eff with an individuality that makes his character memorable. Co-starring Alicia \"Clueless\" Silverstone, \"Blast from the Past\" emerges as an offbeat but uneven romantic comedy about an improbable courtship between Eve Rostokov, a streetwise California gal, and Adam, a na\u00efve 35-year old guy who has spent his entire life in a fall-out shelter. Fearing the prospect of a nuclear holocaust during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, Calvin Webber (Christopher Walken of \"The Anderson Tapes\") and his wife Helen (Sissy Spacek of \"Coal Miner's Daughter\") seal themselves up in an elaborate, subterranean bomb shelter in their backyard and wait for the radioactive contamination to wear off. Thirty-five years elapse before the Webbers dispatch their intelligent but immature son out to procure supplies and a wife who doesn't glow in the dark.\"Blast from the Past\" opens with documentary footage of the Cuban Missile Crisis and then segues to the Webbers' comfortable suburban home where a cocktail party halts when Calvin hears President Kennedy's televised speech. At heart, Calvin is a paranoid Commie hater. When JFK warns that Soviet missiles in Cuba are trained on U.S. targets, Calvin breaks up the party, sends everybody packing, and retreats with his pregnant wife into a steel bunker. Mind you, Calvin's fall-out shelter is no ordinary cement closet but rather an entire house underground with everything Helen and he need to survive for the next 35 years. An eccentric genius in his own right, Calvin gave up his job at California Technical when he found that he could make more money as an inventor. Calvin raises fish in breeding tanks, rigs up a kinescope so they can watch TV re-runs of Jackie Gleason's \"The Honeymooners,\" and furnishes the shelter with exact duplicates of their home d\u00e9cor! Once the filmmakers have the Webbers safely underground, they cut to a jet fighter streaking across the evening skies. The plane develops sudden problems that force the pilot to eject. Guess where the jet crashes? Smack on top of Calvin's fall-out shelter! The fail-safe devices react to the heat from the crash as if it were a nuclear explosion, and the automatic time-locks confine the Webbers for the duration. When the authorities arrive, they assume that the Webbers died in the accident. While the demolition crews clear away the debris, Helen gives birth. Calvin and she rear their son with the misguided belief that everything top-side has been toasted.\"Blast from the Past\" spends about an hour setting up the plot before Brendan Fraser arrives (a number of child actors play him as his character ages) and his older parents decide that it's time to see what's happened up top-side. Indeed, a lot has occurred since they plunged into their hole. Although a nuclear holocaust hasn't turned America into a vast wasteland, a spiritual holocaust has exerted roughly the same effect. Wilson and Kelly depict America's decline into decadence in an amusing subplot that charts the rise and fall of a malt shop built on the site of the Webbers' bomb shelter. As the years march past, the malt shop turns into a low-life bar and eventually degenerates into a hovel for the homeless. Calvin wants nothing to do with this bizarre new world. Along the way, Adam collides with Eve, and she helps him round up his supplies for his mom.Director Hugh Wilson has made a charming social comedy that aspires to be far more than funny. The filmmakers have blended elements of the venerable Rip Van Winkle story and added a touch of sci-fi writer Robert Sheckley to the mix. The culture clash between the 1960s and the 1990s provides most of the comedy with Adam's well-behaved, polite demeanor juxtaposed against Eve's hard-shell cynicism.The comedy is spontaneous with Adam meeting his first female African-American mail carrier (\"Oh, my star, a negro!) to staring wondrously at the sky, the ocean, and the bikini-clad babes on TV who anoint themselves with coconut oil. Never has Adam seen such awesome sights. If the world is one big surprise for Adam, Eve (Alicia Silverstone) finds him just as surprising. When she explains that her roommate Troy (Dave Foley) is gay, Adam thinks mistakenly that Troy is \"happy-go-lucky\" rather than homosexual. \"Blast from the Past\" never explains why Troy resides with Eve or what impact their living arrangement had on Eve's previous boyfriend.The quirky content of \"Blast from the Past\" separates it from the standard Hollywood product. Our twentieth century obsession with law & order compels filmmakers to include cops in virtually every movie. Foreigners must think that America is a police state. The ubiquitous police never appear in \"Blast from the Past.\" A movie about modern-day life that doesn't use cops as a plot device is worth watching for that reason alone. Moreover, gratuitous sex, obligatory violence, and slimy alien creatures never complicate the plot. Indeed, \"Blast\" creates a universe of values and beliefs that most movies either ignore or remove because such philosophical concepts would hinder the action. \"Blast\" might have been funnier had it not been so preoccupied with such a concrete system of values.Improbable as it is, \"Blast from the Past\" is nevertheless an entertaining comedy with much to say about the questionable shifts in American culture. The comedy is brisk; the dialogue is colorful, but the story occasionally bogs down when the characters get a little too preachy.",

It turns out that this is a very well done movie. In this case, a scientist (Christopher Walken) and his wife (Sissy Spacek) move into their fallout shelter during the Cuban Missile Crisis and lock themselves in for 35 years when they think that a bomb has fallen. So, when their son is born in there, they continue raising him as though it's still 1962.When the door finally opens in the late 1990s, the dad walks out and gets mistaken for a God while thinking that his neighborhood has been populated by mutants! From there, much of the movie consists of the son (Fraser) leaving the shelter and interacting with people as he was raised to do. But when he meets a modern-day valley girl (Alicia Silverstone), his life just might change...if he can get out of the Perry Como mold.Anyway, \"BFTP\" is a really fun movie. I would say that it and Joe Dante's \"Matinee\" are the two great movies centering on the Cuban Missile Crisis (\"Thirteen Days\" was good but seemed one-sided).

            "content": "If you're looking for a nice, pleasant, funny and fun movie, you need look no further than \"Blast From The Past.\" No, it's not a masterpiece, but all the adjectives above describe it perfectly, which means that it's thoroughly enjoyable to watch. The movie begins in 1962, with a party at the home of an eccentric scientist and his pregnant wife (Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek). It happens to be the night when President Kennedy goes on television to begin the Cuban Missile Crisis. Convinced that there's about to be a nuclear holocaust, the two enter a massive fallout shelter they've built under their house, which automatically locks them in for 35 years, at which time the world is supposed to be safe to re-enter. Shortly after they enter, their son Adam is born and is raised in the isolation of the shelter, totally cut off from the world and all its changes, untainted by the changing city above them. After 35 years, Adam (the son, played now by Brendan Fraser) is sent above for supplies, and hopefully to find a nice girl to marry.In a way, this isn't especially original. It's a pretty classic fish out of water story, and I have to confess that for the first while I was thinking that more should be done with the whole fish out of water concept. Adam was totally unprepared for the Los Angeles he emerges into. The innocence of the 60's has been replaced by the sordidness of the 90's. But once this is finished, you're actually glad that they didn't make this too over the top with the fish out of water theme. Fraser put on a brilliant performance with his combination of innocence and wonder and that in itself made the movie perhaps funnier than it actually was. As he interacts with those he encounters he makes a difference in their lives by his sheer niceness. Meeting Eve (Alicia Silverstone) he falls for her, but has quite a ways to go to convince her to fall for him. She's suspicious of him: attracted to him, liking him, but not quite sure what to make of him, to the point that she eventually calls in the authorities to have him taken away (the irony being, as she points out to a friend after the fact, that she meets a nice, polite guy who treats her well and her response is to have him committed.)There are a lot of funny scenes in this. The whole concept of the church/cult that springs up around Adam (because the down and out druggie owner of a sleazy bar that's been built over the shelter sees him emerge from underground and thinks he's a god, eventually becoming the \"archbishop\" of a group worshipping Adam) was hilarious, and Adam on the dance floor with the two blondes was worth seeing. But it's the tentative, cautious, up and down relationship between Adam and Eve (too cute, of course, since Adam and his parents believed that he would indeed have to repopulate the earth with whatever \"non-mutant\" girl he could find, post- nuclear holocaust) that makes this work. Fraser and Silverstone were great together. Of course, with this type of movie you know where the two of them are eventually heading, but it's how they get there that's interesting and fun. It's really a very well done movie that may never be considered a classic, but will always leave you glad that you watched it. (8/10)",

Watching the reactions of a full grown man who has been in a fallout shelter with his parents, now coming above ground for the first time is hilarious!  Seeing him search for a \"non-mutant\" girl friend while he learns all about life above ground, is just as funny.  You have two choices.

            "content": "First off, yes, I am a little biased, I want to get that out of the way so that I am not accused of being biased, I am in this case, I love this movie for very personal reasons!I don't always enjoy romcoms, most times they are so painfully \"by the numbers\" they are more dull than a slasher film, at least people die in slashers if they annoy you, most times. ;P This is why \"Blast from the Past\" is so refreshing, while it has more than it's share of romcom clich\u00e9s, it also has many welcoming elements that stray from your typical romcom, which may also be while it failed at the box office, but is definitely far and away, one of the best 1990's Romcoms. Brendan Frasier is a blast to watch, as the innocent and untainted Adam, but it is Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek who steal the show, and while the movie without them is still fun and engaging because of Frasier's fun and amiable performance, the movie really takes off whenever Walken and Spacek are on screen. They are both touching and hilarious in their portrayals, and while display great physical comedy, they never go into caricature, which is quite a delicate balance for a film such as this. This is why the film works, without the Frasier, Spasek, and Walken's performances, this film would fall flat on it's face. Dave Folely and Alicia Silverstone are fun, but they have to play a lot more straight, however, Joel Slotnick, as somewhat unhinged defunct bar owner is fantastic, and provides some of the funniest moments in the film. The reason this film resonated with me as a 14yr when this was released, and the reason it still does today, is unlike \"Pleasantville\" it actually holds the higher moral standards of the 1960's in a much higher regard, it isn't trying to say \"These are bad\", in fact, it definitely portrays honor and decency and respect in a very favorable light. While, yes, often the clash of values is used for comedy or drama, it is never used to in a disrespectful manner. There is something to be said for a man that respects and honors a woman with his attention, but also doesn't just have sex with her, but actually gets to know her and loves her for who she is. This is still an element sorely missing for romantic comedies, they are almost solely based on sex, as if that should always be the basis of a relationship or always is. I have and still may be in the minority, but traditional moral values, while may not be in fashion, just produce better results in society, even if you vehemently disagree with them.I think I cried when the epilogue where Eve says Adam said a child should take care of their parents when they get old, that was always my philosophy, I didn't always appreciate everything my parents did, but I sure understood that they worked their butt off for me, and should they end up old and decrepit, I will take care of them, period, end of story. To see that value put forth in a film was both unexpected and pleasant, and remains a reason I really enjoy this film. God Bless ~Amy",

            "content": "\"Blast From the Past\" - Some SpoilersSitting down to watch \"Blast From the Past\" one night, I didn't expect much. I hadn't read many reviews on the film, but it was my impression it had flopped at the box office and wasn't supposed to be very good. But I was extremely startled upon the first five minutes of watching the film to find it not only funny, but sweet, too.The film starts in the sixties, when husband and mad inventor Christopher Walken and normal wife Sissy Spacek are in their house cleaning up after a dinner party. Walken has created a bomb shelter in case the \"Commies\" drop a nuke; he panics when he hears of possible bombs, and sticks himself and his wife in the underground bomb shelter. Unfortunately, the auto-locks on the underground shelter lock themselves after a jet-fighter from the sky lands on their home outside. Walken and the bomb shelter believe this to be a nuclear bomb, and so they are trapped down in the shelter for about thirty years because Walken programmed the locks not to release for thirty years...Soon they have a child, and after thirty years, the child has grown into Brendan Fraser: an innocent, sixties-type man with sixties clothes, sixties haircut, sixties expressions...because he grew up in the bomb shelter, he's practically been living in the sixties for three decades.So when the locks finally unlock, Walken goes above ground to find the modern world--he believes it to be a post-apocalyptic modern-day earth. He rushes back underground and reports of how the world is to his unhappy wife. They decide to live underground forever. Unfortunately, they are almost out of food and supplies, because Walken only filled the shelter with enough material to last them thirty years. So Fraser volunteers to go up, get some supplies, then come back down. And so the simple plot begins; the fish out of the water meets the modern-day girl (Alicia Silverstone, in this case) who shows him around the modern day earth. It's been done before: \"Crocodile Dundee\" rings a bell. But, like \"Crocodile Dundee,\" \"Blast From the Past\" ranks as one of the best of its kind.It has some great gags. And unlike some comedies where the gags are funny in the beginning but run out of steam towards the end, \"Blast From the Past\" is consistently sweet and funny; perhaps the best romantic comedy in a while (close to the greatness of 1997's \"As Good As it Gets\").\"Blast From the Past\" runs like a film from the sixties--the humor is classy, not crude. There aren't as many sex gags as there could have been, and I'm thankful for that. \"Kids in the Hall\" star Dave Foley plays a gay man who Fraser mistakes to be happy, but that's just about the most sexually-suggestive the film gets.Fraser blends the perfect sense of innocent and childish-sweetness to make his character very likable.Alicia Silverstone adds the right touch of modern-day toughness to her role as a woman doesn't know what to expect when she meets a man that truly has good intentions and is not a creep.Christopher Walken is one of my favorite supporting actors, and he does just as good as always here, as does Sissy Spacek.So, yes, it's been done before, but in recent times, not nearly as sweet or funny as \"Blast From the Past.\"3.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",

I love Adam's reactions to modernisms that he encounters for the first time, such as the \"other man's underwear\" scene, the idea that Troy could have a, gasp, COMPUTER! right there in his house, or the \"Well good for you!\" about Troy being gay.Alicia Silverstone is wonderful as Eve, as are Sissy Spacek and Christopher Walken as Adam's parents, and the rest of the cast.It's hard for me to grasp why some folks don't like this movie!  In my opinion, it's truly refreshing to see a movie where its main character has manners and class, and does not have to rely on today's standards (such as swearing) to carry the movie.If you're in the mood to see a cute romantic comedy, do yourself a favor and watch this movie!",

I can't name the good actors in this because EVERYBODY did a fantastic job, even Alicia Silverstone.The plot is pretty simple.  In 1962, at the height of the Cuban Missile crisis, a young Southern California couple heads down to their elaborately designed fallout shelter, built by the genius, yet paranoid husband (Christopher Walken).  They had only planned on staying for a few days, but at the same time, a military jet crashes into their house above.  They mistakenly think the crash is a nuclear bomb explosion, so they seal it up and stay down for 35 years.  The wife (Sissy Spacek) is 9 months pregnant at the time, so she has her baby (Brendan Fraser) in the shelter.After 35 years, the father is ready to explore the world to see if it is habitable, but just as he's about to get some much-needed supplies, he has a mild heart-attack.  They send their son out instead with a long list and $3000 in cash.  He has also expressed being lonely and says he wants to find a wife.The most entertaining and pleasant portion of the story is how a very nice, conservative upbringing with absolutely no outside negative influences can stick out like a sore thumb in modern society.  This is also sad, to think how low we've sunk.  But still, it's extremely refreshing to see a small sparkle of goodness walk around the Los Angeles area, creating positive results everywhere he goes.The only problem that I have with it is that it is not 100% believable. Some of the scenes were overlooked in the making that kept reminding you that it wasn't real.  Even though he had never seen some of the electronics, he seemed to pick them up a little too fast: TV with remote, elevator, telephone, etc.  The first time he EVER saw the ocean (or any large body of water) in his entire life, he made a PERFECT dive into the water?!But the good far outweighs the bad in this one.  I highly recommend this to just about everyone out there.  Younger kids might not quite understand some of it, but other than that, everyone should enjoy this.",

Everything about this film was likeable, and it is far from teenybopper material.Alicia Silverstone plays Eve, a cynical LA girl tired of 90s men and their inconsiderate, selfish ways. Brendan Fraser is Adam, a 35-year-old who's spent his entire life living in a nuclear bomb shelter after his paranoid parents (played by Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek) mistook a 1962 plane crash for the start of World War III. Cocooned in a cosy world of cheesy 50s sitcoms and endless Perry Como, Adam is understandably frustrated and so jumps at the chance to get out and re-supply the shelter.Almost immediately he meets Eve, and from then on the comedy is meant to flow from the clash between her street-smart twenty-something and Adam's impeccably-mannered, old-school gent.The performances in Blast from the Past shine, Silverstone providing a performance that overlaps anything she has ever done, Fraser also gets the \u0091best-of-his-career' nod. But, Spacek and Walken succeed the most as Adam's odd-ball parents, their performances are sparkling and watchable. The script is very original, lots of the jokes are knock-your-socks-off funny. But, there are many trashy things about this film, it becomes a little unimaginative and silly towards the end, and it is a touch too predictable, but I still liked this film a lot.Blast from the Past is a thoroughly winning film, I recommend it for all you people who want to have a good time on a Tuesday night.I rate Blast from the Past 7 out of 10.",

I well remember the public psychosis about the Soviet threat and the need to protect yourself from that threat. I can easily imagine today's generation thinking how preposterous the entire story-line was but it was absolutely spot on.People really were that crazy; most likely though they didn't have the money or the brains to build such an elaborate underground house but the will was certainly there. We loved the decorations on the wall, the furniture, the clothes and the kitchen elements; they were all true to my memory if not a little too rich for my childhood. The most memorable scene in the film was the last one where the father is seen pacing out the dimensions of his,soon to be built, new fall-out shelter; the lessons of the past are too difficult for many of us.This set decoration topic obviously continues through the movie and the confrontation of the past with the reality of the present were very funny to me. The whole idea of a soda fountain, circa 1960, morphing into first a bar hangout and lastly into a Vally porn shop was fascinating as well as very funny. True, some commentators have bagged the movie because they thought it devolved into a typical Hollywood love-drama in the last half but I saw the love story as being central to the movie's theme. That love theme was the glue that held the various story-line pieces together and made the entire ending a major part of the film thus preventing it from becoming just a scifi film. We enjoyed the movie hugely and well definitely be watching it again, particularly for the set decoration memories.",

The script and direction work in concert with a superb cast to tell a touching and original story about a man raised in a fallout shelter who has to cope with life in America in the 1990s. Heading the cast is Brendan Fraser, who's pitch-perfect as naif Adam Webber, who's spent 35 years growing up in a fallout shelter after his father mistakenly assumes nuclear war broke out back in 1962. Fraser is wonderful, but so is everyone else in the cast. Alicia Silverstone has one of her best-ever roles as the cynical Eve, who reluctantly befriends Adam. Dave Foley is a delight as Eve's gay best friend, Troy. Equally impressive are Christopher Walken as Adam's brilliant but daffy father, and Sissy Spacek as Adam's sweet, long suffering mom. Even the smallest roles are well-acted, with special kudos to Joey Slotnik, Nathan Fillion, the two beautiful blondes Adam dances with in the nightclub scene, the deadpan grocery clerk at the meat counter, and the nutty guy Adam sits next to on his first bus ride. It's also got an unbeatable soundtrack, and a story that never loses steam until its sweetly ironic ending. It's also one of those rare comedies that doesn't have a mean moment in it.

Best of all, it does not \"stretch\" for the humor in juxtaposing the past and present; the humor just flows naturally from the comedic, yet touching, story.Not only the writing is good. The cast is near-perfect for this story. Brendan Fraser can inhabit a na\u00efve or cartoonish character better than anyone (only Will Ferrell comes close).

            "content": "'Blast from the Past' was never going to win any major awards, it was never going to re- define postmodern cinema or even be remotely block-busting. It was surely conceived as a harmless piece of fluffy fun originating from the ludicrous but cute conceit that a family - headed by a gloriously loopy Christopher Walken - has been living in a fully-functioning nuclear shelter beneath L.A. since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Now in his 30s, the son born to Walken and his equally loopy and long-suffering wife Sissy Spacek, is sent on a mission into modern-day L.A. to accumulate supplies. 'Adam', played with sweet charm and gusto by Brendan Fraser soon meets his 'Eve' (Alicia Silverstone) and the film then charts his assimilation into modern life (and the ghastly realisation that his father has been deluded for so long) and his ensuing comic romance.There are numerous mildly (though never gut-bustingly funny) comic sequences in this film - the hippie's cult, Adam on the bus, Adam at the Holiday Inn, but most particularly, the antics of Adam's parents, most especially Walken. Indeed, the entire underground-bunker set-up and how the family survive so many years is brilliantly orchestrated and strangely fascinating too. There are also occasional touching moments too - Adam's discovery of the ocean for the first time for example. The stand-out scene is the 1940s nightclub where Adam gets to strut his funky stuff in a dance sequence overflowing with brio and panache. The Big Band music is brilliant.On the downside, Silverstone's performance is occasionally a little jarring, and the characterisation of her friend Troy needed some fleshing out. This is clearly not a mega- budget film which is far from a criticism in itself, but the look, feel and flow is occasionally clunky, and a little cheap-looking. Overall I give this a 7.5/10 - (8 on the IMDb star system, rather than 7) as much for its enthusiasm, some fine comic performances and its endearing charm.",

Rich eccentric inventor Calvin Weber (Christopher Walken) brings his pregnant wife Helen (Sissy Spacek) down to the bunker. An American jet accidentally falls on their house and the bunker automatically locks for 35 years. Everybody assumes that they're dead and they assume that the world is destroyed by nuclear war. After 35 years, Calvin comes up to find the rundown neighborhood a foreign world. He wants his family to stay underground but Helen insists her boy Adam (Brendan Fraser) be allowed to see the sky. He's a fish out of water. He's about to be taken advantage of but Eve Vrustikov (Alicia Silverstone) helps him out. Together they set out to buy supplies for the underground bunker. Troy (Dave Foley) is her gay roommate and Cliff (Nathan Fillion) is her jealous ex.The first 30 minutes is not funny enough and it's better to get to the modern day sooner. Fraser is a bit annoying at first but his childlike exuberance slowly wins me over. Silverstone is good as the tough chick who can't find love. They have a nice rom-com chemistry. The dance scene is fun and most importantly, it slowly dawns on Eve that she's jealous and in love. The movie is a bit too long, the start is too slow and not all the intended comedy works. Nevertheless, the couple is good enough and it has a sweet light charm.",

If anything, this movie spoofs the real psychotic attitude of the early to mid frame cold war years, where fallout shelters were the rage.

This one was just so good it's worth recommending.The first 40 minutes or so, basically the setup, is like something out of vintage Mad magazine. Then the movie almost seamlessly transitions into a romantic comedy that contrasts the comparatively \"innocent\" early baby boomer period with the cynical \"anything goes\" of late 1990s.

            "content": "Blast from the Past is directed by Hugh Wilson who also co-writes the screenplay with Bill Kelly. It stars Brendan Fraser, Alicia Silverstone, Christopher Walken, Sissy Spacek and Dave Foley. Music is by Steve Dorff and cinematography by Jose Luis Alcaine. Plot has Fraser as a 35 year old man who after being raised by his parents in a nuclear fallout shelter, surfaces to sample American life in the 1990s.A different spin on the fish-out-of-water premise, Blast from the Past in a gentle romantic comedy that although light and breezy, does show how society has vastly changed over a three and half decade period, happily tinting the edges with satire as the central couple, Fraser and Silverstone (yes, they be called Adam and Eve) engage in way that perfectly befits the airy nature of the story. They make for a perfect \"opposites attract\" couple, he is all about 50s and 60s values such as good manners and positivity, she is street smart, cynical and knowingly trampish. It makes for good honest fun, as they inevitably get into strange situations because no one is quite sure how to take Adam. As he ambles along devoid of fear and loving the first sightings of things that many take for granted (the sky, the sea etc), it has a charm factor that is hard to dismiss. But the Adam and Eve coupling, and the presence of Eve's gay roommate (Foley excellent), only brings smiles instead of laughs, the bulk of the chuckles come from Walken and Spacek as Adam's nuclear age parents down in the shelter. He is an eccentric scientist, seemingly happy to forever stay in the magnificent shelter he built, she is apple pie homely but starting to get stir crazy and hitting the cooking sherry by way of coping! Once Adam goes above ground (after half hour of smart character build up in the shelter), and the film then focuses on the Adam and Eve axis, you may find yourself hankering after a bit more of Walken and Spacek, both of whom give performances to savour. The film has no great surprises, and we sure as heck fire know where it's going, but the journey engages without clamouring for sentiment and the on form cast hold the attention throughout. 7/10",

At the height of the Cuban missile crisis Calvin has built an underground bomb shelter with decades of supplies but it is a plane crash that he takes for a bomb that sees him and Helen flee underground. While the world moves on overhead, the Webbers are assumed dead in the crash while they actually try to raise their son Adam in their large shelter. Decades go by and young Adam has become a man by the time the shelter automatically opens. Calvin mistakes the night in the bad neighbourhood above him for a society in decay and returns full of fear. However a heart attack sees Adam forced to head to the surface.The plot suggests a comedy that will deliver comedy a la Enchino Man (albeit that not being a good thing in itself) but the delivery is much closer to a romantic comedy-drama. This mix is perhaps partly responsible for the film itself being all very so-so; amiable enough but nothing worth writing home about and likely to be forgotten not long after finishing watching it. This is not to say it is bad though because mostly it is a fairly inoffensive affair that fills the time. The plot is nonsense of course but underground it sort of works as it is in its own world. When Adam comes to the surface though it tries to be \"real\" but the fact that it is nonsense is clearer than ever, which is a problem since it also asks us to buy into Adam and Eve's relationship at this point \u0096 something I found hard to do. However it does provide amusement even if there are surprisingly few laughs bigger than a chuckle.The cast help it be better than it is (albeit only to a point). Fraser's boyish innocence works well in the title role. His material is weak but yet he goes with it and is good with it. Walken is mercifully restrained where he could easily have hammed it up in the caricature of himself which he does sometimes. His underplaying works well in the context. Spacek is not as good. It doesn't help that her character isn't that good but she doesn't do much with it either way. Silverstone is dumped with the \"straight\" role and has to convince in her growing relationship with Adam; she does it better than I expected but still isn't great, partly thanks to the material. Support from Foley and a few others is all well and good but mostly the film is best when Fraser, Walken or both are allowed to do their work.Even with them though this is amiable distraction at best. The comedy is soft and not particularly funny and the drama side not convincing at all as it is undermined by the silliness of the overall concept. It will pass the time but nothing more than that.",

The 50's/early 60's styling is spot on, and all the character actors add wonderful spice. We just brought it over to a friends' home to watch it on their new very large television, and noticed even more details that we have missed in the past. The plot, while somewhat predictable as a romantic comedy, also leaves enough room for both main characters (Adam and Eve!) to grow as people, which I very much appreciate. Brendan Fraser, Alicia Silverstone and the rest of the actors were well cast, and fit the parts as if they were born to them. The writing and pacing is tight, which is another reason to watch it more than once. There are quite a few foreshadowing references/events which you will definitely miss the first time. I enjoy it more each time I see it. There are very few movies that I can say that about. You will also laugh out loud more than once.If you enjoy romantic comedies with great \"unsaid lines\" (said with just a glance,) coupled with a crazy sounding premise that works (supported by excellent cast, writing, set dressing and pacing) then you will be glad that you watched this movie.

In this film, Christopher Walken plays a father (\"Calvin Webber\") who espouses wholesome family values and is shown as a religious man. So this man who - gasp - says grace at meals - is pictured as a complete lunatic. What else? Is there no end to the cheap shots by these atheists who dominate the film world?I did enjoy the first third of this movie but when Brendan Fraser's lead character, \"Adam Webber\" went \"up' to the existing world, the movie just fades into another \"fish out of water\" film, which has been used many times in many different circumstances.This was no \"blast\" from the past.

Anyway - this is a very good film. Not only is it funny, it is an intelligent kind of fun - just look at Walken (who performs, like he always does, splendidly) and his obsessiveness, or the mother (Spacek) who is clearly going bonkers (and becoming an alcoholic) in the shelter. Or the nutty owner of the bar (\"Leave my elevator alone!\"). I even thought Silverstone's character was fairly good, though the twists of the plot forced her to become unnecessarily hostile in the bar scenes. Imagine how a white person who had never actually seen a colored person (or vice versa, for that matter), only heard about \"them\" would react. That is REALLY funny.What bothers me is the ease with which Eve falls for this guy. The way he acts, talks and dresses would be more than enough to put her off completely - I for one would have called some authority a lot sooner...But, it is a comedy, and a romantic one at that, so let's not bother about scientific or psychological facts and theories.

            "review_title": "An amusing comedy that chose safety over hilarity",
            "content": "\"Blast from the Past\" is pleasant and amusing, while delivering an interesting commentary on social values and the deterioration of manners, education and other aspects of society. Brendan Fraser is perfect as Adam, a Renaissance man with superb theoretical social skills but inexperience, so initially comes off as nothing more than a likable doofus, but gradually grows into the gentleman he was trained to become. His character's innocence, na\u00efvet\u00e9 and tendency to view issues as B&W dichotomies represent society's world view in the 1950s and 1960s. Christopher Walken delivers an unusually understated performance and steals the film in the very last scene. Alicia Silverstone does as well as can be expected with the material she was given, but her Eve character is underdeveloped. She seems like an okay sort of girl next door, but doesn't offer enough to justify Adam's fascination with her to the exclusion of several other girls who superficially seem more obvious choices. She has a competing love interest in Cliff, but it never seems clear why she loved him before and doesn't love him now but is still a bit fixated on him. The relationship seems a bit contrived. He's there when the plot needs a low point for Adam but conveniently absent at other times. And it doesn't make much sense that alpha male Cliff would have moved in with her rather than inviting her to move in with him, or that he wouldn't park in front of her house. Eve's entire character also seems contrived. She doesn't seem the type who would frequent the trendy nightclub they visit or to have a gay roommate. While the film is amusing, it falls short of hilarious. Much of the humor is fairly subtle. Many jokes and gags require lengthy setups. The writers don't fully utilize all of the comic tools in their arsenal. There aren't many sight gags other than Adam's unstylish suit. Recurring and 1-2-3 gags aren't used very effectively. The baseball cards and baseball game don't escalate the humor. There are a few verbal gags and double entendres, such as gay/happy, but there's room for many more. The foreground and background aren't used effectively. At one point Eve and her gay roommate Troy enter a porn shop looking for Adam. They jump up and down on the floor, to determine if there's a basement, but it's done very seriously. Cut twice to a customer clutching an armload of VHS tapes and backing away as if they are weird. The Pakistani shop owner approaches, wearing a lot of gold jewelry in what may or may not have been intended as a politically incorrect commentary on the influence of immigrants growing rich by peddling porn. They have an exchange that includes one of the best jokes in the movie, then ask about a rear entrance. Including the setup, the scene lasts for about eighty seconds. It could have been shortened by showing the customer in the background instead of in separate shots. The customer is overweight and looks a bit nerdish or borderline weird. There are a number of things they could have done to make the scene funnier. He could have dropped a tape at Eve's feet and she could have picked it up for him only to have him deny it was his. He could have hurriedly replaced a movie and asked the shopkeeper if he carries any historical documentaries. He could have approached Eve and asked her if she was Dixie Normous, the famous porn star, and asked if she would autograph the box for him. Troy does a little dance step in an effort to see if the floor sounds hollow. He could have gotten on his knees and put his ear to the floor. That could have led to a sight gag and physical comedy. Except for the one joke, which was admittedly one of the best in the movie, the setting could have been changed to a barbershop or grocery store. They didn't push the envelope or try to squeeze every laugh they could out of the scene. In part, they seem to have tried to be inoffensive, going as far as to blur the images of bare breasts on the video jackets, possibly trying to maintain the tone and sensitivities of the 1950s and 1960s. For their efforts, the film still got a PG-13 rating. But what's the point? Viewers who would be most likely to appreciate the references to manners, mores and cultural references of that period would have been in their forties or fifties in 1999 when the film was released. Much of the humor would have made no sense to younger viewers. Some aspects of the movie are simply not funny. A character becomes alcoholic. Another character goes stir-crazy. A plane crashes in a residential neighborhood. While they take pains to suggest there were no casualties, including having the plane go vertical before nosediving, plane crashes simply aren't funny. Consequently, the film has an uneven tone. But the trade-off is a cinematic billet doux to a lost age of innocence.",

His (and Christopher Walken's and Dave Foley's) understanding of the subtle humor carries the film.It might be a perfect film if someone other than Alicia Silverstone was cast as the leading lady. Silverstone doesn't seem to understand that Eve can be sarcastic and cynical without being downright mean. She is of the false notion that making faces, grimacing and scowling substitute for portrayal of a complex role.Perhaps it's a matter of poor characterization on the writer's part, but the confusing Eve just left me mad - even yelling at the screen: she can't decide what she wants, isn't honest to Adam, and plays that \"cruel to be kind\" style of flirting. Her jealousy and cattiness is cliche, and so \"movie and magazine stereotypical.\" (i.e., getting jealous of the two blondes swing dancing with style with Adam, furious that Adam went home with Sophia, even though Eve left the night club without Adam.)I can get past that, though, because every other character is carried out confidently and wisely by the rest of the cast. It moves along nicely with surprising observations the whole way.Four subtly hilarious moments: 1. Adam: \"Driver! Stop the bus! Stop the bus immediately!\" 2. Bellhop: \"Dial 9 to get out.\" Adam: \"Of what?\" 3. Adam: (sincerely, whenever he leaves one's presence) \"May I be excused?\" 4. Adam: (confused after Eve calls someone a Dickhead, he falls against a wall in a confused state) \"I'm just trying to picture...\"I just thought this was a truly sweet film - the polite, respectful, innocent man is a dream come true. If only I could meet someone who's been underground for 35 years, purely unjaded by the world, and as honest as Adam! Then again, this is a movie.",

            "content": "The premise of this movie, though far-fetched, is really quite clever. Then the film becomes a typical, run of the mill romance, with Brendan Frasier acting like a goofy little boy and Alicia Silverstone giving a terrible performance.The year is 1962, and Calvin Webber (Christopher Walken) has secretly been building a huge underground bomb shelter stocked with food and all the needs for his wife Helen (Sissy Spacek) and their soon to be son Adam (Brendan Frasier). Calvin thinks the Cold War has started when a fire hits their house and they go underground. To avoid nuclear fallout, the time lock doesn't let them out for 35 years. In this time Helen has the baby, and they try to live normal lives. Meanwhile up above them, their house was demolished and their neighborhood made into a collection of porno and liquor stores. When the time lock goes off, Adam is sent up to get supplies for the family, and to meet a woman. He ends up meeting Eve (Alicia Silverstone), who he falls for. She works for him driving him around and helping him sell his father's very rare baseball cards. Bad romance and acting ensues from here.The first 40 minutes or so are really amusing. Life in the fallout shelter is interesting to watch, and Christopher Walken is a great opening lead actor. The film then switches away from him to Brendan Frasier, and it's actually still good then too. The fish out of water comedy is actually funny, and Brendan's goofy over the top performance works well. But, when Alicia Silverstone comes into the picture, this falls apart. She is absolutely terrible in this, and she has awful dialogue too, making this a double whammy for her role. The romantic scenes are really corny, and the musical score only makes it worse. By the end, this is no more than your average romance flick, and maybe even worse than the typical romance films in some ways, but the opening and some moments of well done humor keep this movie (barely) afloat.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 112 mins.

            "content": "This film did surprisingly poor business, not so much because it's bad, but because it turns out to be the type of slight picture that doesn't generate \"Must-See\" word of mouth, yet eventually finds a home on the small screen.\"Blast From the Past\" is able to overcome a rather listless first 20 minutes or so, in which it methodically and somewhat mechanically lays the groundwork for its stockpile of running jokes; and emerges as an agreeable, if modest comedy that supplies at least a dozen big laughs.Hugh Wilson is a rather hit-or-miss director, whose films always seem to be stretched too thin (like \"Guarding Tess\"). Too often, there just doesn't seem to be enough going on, and he can stubbornly persist with secondary material that just isn't funny - like the running gag about the religious cult that forms around Fraser when he first comes up from underground. Every once in a while, however, Wilson hits his stride and finds just the right touch - as in the moment where it suddenly dawns on Dave Foley's bitchy gay best friend that good manners like Fraser's are a show of respect for those in his company, not a sign of superiority.It's great to see Christopher Walken in a non-villainous role, playing the square, paranoid scientist father, and looking quite a bit like Michael Douglas' vigilante in \"Falling Down\". There's always been a hint of amusement in even his vilest bad guy portrayals, and here he shows a nice flair for comedy. (As he did when he guest-hosted on \"SNL\", come to think of it.) As the naive, hilariously polite innocent, Fraser gets all the laugh-out-loud lines (\"DRIVER, PLEASE STOP THE BUS!\"); and Silverstone is very appealing in her melt-away cute way, as the cynical but vulnerable 90's chick. She does a good job varying her bewildered \"What planet are you from?\" reactions to Fraser's bizarre behaviour. The two have a nice chemistry together.There's an illogical decision by Silverstone's character near the end which was not believable for a second, but this is generally a funny movie with a measure of charm.",

Calvin has worked assiduously over years to prepare for the anticipated nuclear holocaust - he has recreated his home underground, and supplied the family with enough food and necessities to last 30+ years. During the Cuban missile crisis, Calvin and his pregnant wife rush into the shelter. Sure enough, there's a huge blast. It's not the nuclear disaster Calvin thinks it is - it's a plane that crashes on his property and blows up.Calvin and Helen stay where they are, and Helen gives birth to baby Adam. Adam knows The Honeymooners and Perry Como records; he is home-schooled by his dad while his frustrated mother is boozing it up in the kitchen.When he's 35, Adam goes out into the world because it's now safe. He goes up in the elevator and comes out onto a building holding a bunch of homeless people, as the property has changed hands a couple of times since the house was decimated. One of the homeless men thinks he's Jesus.Out in the world, Adam meets the adorable Eve (Silverstone) who is totally '90s, as well as her gay friend Troy (Foley), and the cultures clash. And one other thing - in Eve, Adam has discovered woman.This is a cute comedy with lots of charm and great casting. Spacek and Walken as a couple - inspired, and Fraser is perfect as a happy, naive youth out in the world for the first time. Alicia Silverstone is delightful, and her reactions during the scene in which Adam tells her his real background are a riot. You can just see the wheels of panic.There isn't anything particularly new or fresh about this film, though it's fun. Characters have often wound up in other eras or on other planets. However, it is very pleasant with a good soundtrack, and a film that will appeal especially to those of us who well remember fallout shelters, the threat of Communism, and President Kennedy on TV talking about the Cuban missile crisis.",

They are simple films, inoffensive and entertaining but usually almost instantly forgettable. It takes something special, different or unique to really make a rom-com stand out from the pack.Blast from the Past does have such a quality, in that its' plot is slightly different \u2013 Adam (Brendan Fraser) has spent his entire life in a fallout shelter (for reasons too long-winded to bother going into now) and emerges 35 years later to find a drastically changed world from that which his father (Christopher Walken) has taught him about. He must learn about this new world quickly with the help of his new friend Eve (Alicia Silverstone). Eve is wary at first of this strange man with impeccable manners and an unbelievably na\u00efve view of the world. As they grow closer\u0085.well you can fill in the rest from there. Even the character names give the plot away! Though the plot itself is pretty predictable, the story of this 35-year-old guy approaching the world with the open-eyed wonder of a child is quite refreshing, and calls to mind a time when life was simpler. Brendan Fraser manages to capture this fresh-faced wonder without ever being too cringing. However, Alicia Silverstone's handling of her character's inevitable transition from being sceptical to falling in love does not ring totally true. She is adequate without being outstanding. Dave Foley is the beautiful girl's gay friend Troy \u2013 after all, every beautiful girl has a gay friend, or at least that's what these rom-coms would have us believe! Maybe it is so that there is another lead male that we can like without him ever being any kind of a threat to the leading man? Whatever it is, the situation does lead to some genuinely funny scenes. Further, it could have been quite easy to go way over the top with both the goofy comedy and slushy sentiment, and fortunately manages to avoid that fate on both counts.Also, a review of Blast from the Past would not be complete without mention of the music \u2013 filled with classic 50s and 60s swing music as well as more modern stuff (watch out for Troy teaching Adam the YMCA dance) and a terrific scene in a swing club, with great swing dancing and real toe-tapping music supplied by the Flying Neutrinos and the Cherry Popping' Daddies.

It is 1962 at the height of the Cuban missile crisis. Walken has built an elaborate fallout shelter to sustain his family for 35 years in the event of a nuclear war. He and his wife mistakenly believe the war has begun when a plane crashes into their house. They lock the shelter and begin their 35 years underground. A little boy is born to them shortly thereafter, and he is raised in this insulated environment for the next 35 years.The passage of time in the shelter details the raising of their son who matures as the full grown Brendan Fraser. When the time arrives for them emerge (the present day) they send Fraser out into the world they believe has been adversely affected by the nuclear holocaust. Fraser meets Alicia Silverstone, a young Valley Girl who works in a baseball card store. Of course, she takes Fraser under her wing and the expected \"fish out of water\" situations develop. The romantic ins and outs of the second half of the film are quite predictable, but Fraser and Silverstone are so irresistibly charming that they overcome this easily. In a fantastic scene where Fraser does a dynamite 40's dance with two lovelies in a club, Silverstone realizes her true feelings towards him. By the way, Fraser does all his own dancing.This brief overview cannot even attempt to convey the magical synergy between the characters. Spacek and Walken are wonderful playing against type in roles so different from the serious parts we are used to seeing them in. Dave Foley is also effective as the platonic friend of Silverstone. Fraser and Silverstone beautifully portray the warmth and romance of the growing affection between their characters.Last but not least, some mention must be made of the stupendous soundtrack. Music is used to great effect from beginning to end. The song hits of the various decades will have you tapping your toes and running to the store to buy the CD. The use of surround sound is also quite effective in the musical sequences and in use of both subtle and explosive sound effects.Wilson, director of \"First Wives Club\", has another entertaining comedy to add to his credits.

The highly-concocted scenario, concerning a 35-year-old man--having spent his life in a fallout shelter--entering modern society for the first time and falling in love, is so ridiculous on every level that the initial set-up is naturally full of groaners (especially with mom Sissy Spacek climbing down into the shelter with her pot-roast and oven mitts). But the film works hard to win its audience over and, with Fraser's performance as Adam so dead-on, it nearly succeeds. Alicia Silverstone is adorable as Eve (please!), yet her character doesn't make any sense (her erratic behavior would certainly scare any man away). The fake-nostalgia is thick enough to choke on, but any contemporary movie that plugs Perry Como so insistently can't be all bad... ** from ****",

            "content": "Blast from the Past is a romantic comedy with a silly title and a silly plot, but I don't feel cheated because it has pace and made me smile. The silly plot goes like this - SPOILERS AHEAD - it's the time of the Cuba crisis, Pres. Kennedy is on TV and Dad Webber (Christopher Walken) decides to move himself and mother-to-be Helen (Sissy Spacek) to his underground fallout shelter, which turns out to be something like Fort Knox stocked with food and supplies enough for a medium-sized country. For no reason that I can see, a jet fighter on a survey mission (over Cuba ?) crashes on the Weber's house (in Los Angeles huh? ) convincing Dad that nuclear WWIII has started. So what more natural than that he locks himself with Helen about-to-deliver into the shelter by activating a 35-year time lock ?To help us swallow this scenario which will lead to their newborn son Adam (Brendan Fraser) growing up for 35 years with only his parents' tutelage in 1960s values, the scriptwriters helpfully explain some practical matters like the septic tank, but miss many others such as where does the electric power come from and why do they have unlimited technical equipment but no radio?Thankfully the 35 years go by fairly quickly (for us), the door lock goes \"click\" and now our family can emerge. Whoops - the reason given for staying underground is that \"the nuclear radiation has a half-life of 35 years\" so declaring an all-clear seems premature. Anyway Dad does go upside and basically misunderstands everything he sees in the sleazy LA district that has developed where the Webber house used to stand. He returns convinced that radiation has caused a race of mutant humans to evolve. Hellooooo!Now it is son Adam's turn to venture into today's world, and what has happened so far is best forgotten as being a clumsy set-up for the boy-meets-girl formulaic comedy that follows. I find that hardly worth describing, it has stereotypical characters and the girl that Adam meets is named Eve (played by Alicia Silverstone who is sour when she should be sweet and never gets sweet at all). After a bit of chasing,  a bit of Eve getting bitchy about Adam being popular with girls at a nightclub, one of whom really is sweet, a bit of Adam punching a rival boyfriend, a bit of Adam being gentlemanly to the first black person he meets, an ongoing joke with a gay friend who \"understands\" Eve (but thankfully does not ham up his stereotype), it is time for Adam and Eve to ride off together into the sunset - or, in this case, to gently ease his parents into the present, non-atom-blasted reality. Why that should be such a problem, and why a goofy religious fanatic needs to be kept on hand after he has delivered a few gags, I can't tell you. The movie just seemed to run out into the sand at that juncture.But I am not complaining, nor do I feel the need to expose this good-hearted comedy to probing sociological analysis nor poke more holes in it. For similar movie-meat cooked much more profoundly, watch instead Pleasantville, which I have also reviewed. BTW is the Viet Nam debacle still such a catharsis in the US/Hollywood psyche that filmmakers turn to the Cuban missile crisis almost as light relief ? After all, no one feels that as dangerous now and we won it, didn't we ?",

Having grown up in a '60's environment, he of course also runs into some big differences in language and morals. It's a real good comical premise to create a fun movie with. For most part \"Blast from the Past\" is also a fun movie but not halve as good and entertaining as it could had been if it had used a different approach.The movie begins as a comedy almost entirely set in the inside of a fallout shelter, that looks almost exactly like a real house and also has its own supermarket and fishing-pool. The main characters of the movie are being played by Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek. However the second halve of the movie entirely focuses on the 'son', played by Brendan Fraser, in the big wide world, with Alicia Silverstone as his love interest. It makes the movie so that it can be divided into two separate parts. It does make the movie disjointed and also not the best to watch comedy around.The movie its premise does offer the movie plenty of comical opportunities. At first it handles this well and it provide the movie with some of its best and most fun moments, when the Brendan Fraser sees the 'world' and everything that is in it for the first time. Yet later on the movie lays its emphasis entirely on the love-story, which does makes this movie nothing more than just another typical and also predictable genre movie. A waste of the good comical potential this movie its premise offered.The acting is still top-class. Brendan Fraser is actually a real great comical actor that can make his character likable as well as believable, without ever going too over-the-top with it. But yes, it's definitely true that the best roles of the movie are being played by Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek. They are great actors and play their characters subtly hilarious. The movie is filled with some good written comical characters and some good lines to let the fine actors deliver.It's a movie with a couple of hilarious moments and also some great lines but its romantic-comedy approach doesn't really make this movie as original and hilarious as it could had been.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

I have to say, I didn't really expect much from it... a quirky romantic comedy on a rather goofy sounding premise starring Alicia Silverstone (who didn't exactly distinguish herself in Excess Baggage). But this movie just blew me away. I loved it. I laughed (a lot), I cried (more than once)... definitely one of the year's best for me! Christopher Walken has always been one of my favourite actors, and he turns in a fine performance here as the proud and slightly deluded father intent on protecting his family. But he couldn't have carried the movie on his own. Of course it certainly helps that the script is strong and the direction sure... firmly founded in historical and cultural awareness and never for a moment losing sight of the humanity of the characters. But then almost all the performances are strong. Veteran Sissy Spacek as the mother is as good as you'd expect from her illustrious career. Brendan Fraser continues to go up in my estimation - he has the most difficult role of all, needing to be both absurd and heroic, and to avoid falling into the bathetic or saccharine... and I felt he succeeded admirably. Then Alicia Silverstone... well, I still have slightly mixed feelings about her (perhaps Clueless raised too many wrong expectations)... but really she brings a liveliness and warmth to her role here, and turns in a functional and endearing performance. And Dave Foley as her 'special best friend' Troy definitely deserves a mention of his own... he makes a major contribution. I'd recommend this movie to just about anyone... or at least anyone who finds humour, intelligence and humanity in a movie sufficient.",

Yes, I am a 21-year-old college male and yes, most of my friends make fun of me for loving/owning this movie, but I don't care! Hugh Wilson has come a long way since \"Police Academy\"! (And thank goodness!) After spending his whole life in a bomb shelter with his \"Leave it to Beaver\" parents we watch as Adam (a 30+ year-old man) sees the world for the first time. He's a big, very-likable child who assumes that everybody shares his love of Perry Como. I must say, though, that the highlight of this movie for me had to be Dave Foley (from \"Kids in the Hall\" fame). If for nothing else, watch it for him. I also found him to be one of the most likable screen characters in recent memory.I would say if you loved watching Dave Foley in \"NewsRadio,\" then this is a must-see. It's hard to say just what makes this movie's naivete so contagious, but it works. It's far-fetched, it's cheesy, it's idealistic.

I am surprised there are 199 reviews of this movie (200 now), and not a single review discusses politics.Director Hugh Wilson (Police Academy) seems to be to making a political or social point here. The romance/comedy between Adam (Brandan Frasier) and Eve (Alicia Silverston) seems an incidental add-on. So much care and attention to detail went into creating the look and feel of 1960 America, the whole point of the movie must be to contrast that time with today. I don't buy the Webber family going down into their elaborate back yard shelter in 1960 and then returned to the surface in 1999, as simply a vehicle for this romance comedy.The Webbers are a nice family if not perfect. Mr Webber dresses and acts a lot like Michael Douglas in the movie 'Falling Down'. During a period of tension during the cold war, while the Webber family is in their bomb shelter - a plane crashes in the families yard - they assume nuclear war. They educate and train their only child Adam underground as best they can inside the bomb shelter. Time passes. Mr Webber sends his son Adam, 35 now, above ground for the first time to get supplies for the family. Telling him, \"be careful for mutants, son\". When Adam gets up top, he mistakes half the people he meets for mutants (transsexuals, punk rockers, etc).Adam does meet Eve, falling in love with her. First, prudently asking if she's a mutant or not. The characters in the film are all likable - the Webber family, and Eve, playing a redemptive role here, and Eves' friend Troy - as is the movie itself likable.As is the case in many movies, the child here, Adam (who's only ever meet 2 people in his entire life, his mom and dad), has a lesson for the adults. Adam saying, \"Manners, are just a way for us to show other people we care about them\". Later adding, \"A 'gentleman' is, someone who always tries to make sure people around him or her are as comfortable as possible.\" Eve asks about Adam, \"Where do you think he got all that information?\" Eves' friend replies, \"From the oddest place - his parents.\"",

Christopher Walken is the king of quirky and is a perfect choice to play this odd character. The only problem with him is he doesn't have enough screentime.\nSurviving nuclear war is something Calvin has thought about and he has built a fallout shelter; that is almost like a house and has enough supplies to last three people 35 years. The third person being the son he and his wife are expecting. They're son, Adam(Fraser), is born in the shelter and he is taught much in the fields of academics, but some parts of his education are somewhat deficient. So when he emerges into the modern world, the naive 35 year old is in for something of an adventure. As he-with the accompaniment of a girl he meets, ironically named Eve-learns and experiences all the world has to offer including love. Adam is the greenhorn to end all others and the comedy mostly rests on how he handles situations. The picture constantly seems to find new ways to keep the same joke fresh-which is no easy feat. Something else the film manages to do that most comedies fail too, is it doesn't purely rely on being gross for laughs and neither is it completely asinine. The latter is mainly because it doesn't want to simply portray Adam as a dimwit. Despite his unworldiness and simplicity, the film wishes to also accentuate his merits and value. This works in large part because of what a charming and likeable actor Brendan Fraser is. Amd despite being so callow, Adam isn't irritating and a character you can invest in.Blast From The Past takes an intresting premise and actually delivers on it. Supported by some amusing performances and sturdy writing, the picture stays funny for the majority of its 112 minutes.",

That is, what to do if we received word that Russia had bombed us. I also remember a few neighbors building their own 'bomb shelter' at home, stocked with food and water, in case there was an attack.This 1999 movie stars Brendan Fraser as Adam Webber, whose father Calvin (played with great comic timing by Christopher Walken) was a technical geek who built the bomb shelter of all bomb shelters. Knowing that radiation from a nuclear bomb attack would take years to decay, he built a shelter with systems to allow them to live in it for 35 years.Most of the SPOILERS follow. One day Calvin hears a loud bang and rushes his pregnant wife into the shelter, sure it was the beginning of a nuclear attack. So sure, he activated the locking device that would only open after 35 years. So Adam was born and raised in the shelter, his only contact with the outside world those things his dad and mom, Helen (Sissy Spacek, another of my favorites), taught him. And they did give him a very good education.Finally, all grown up, Adam is allowed to surface to get family supplies and assess the situation. Naturally everything is strange to him, and he finds out it was not a nuclear attack after all that had driven his family underground, but a military jet crashing onto their home. He meets Eve (Alicia Silverstone) who he convinces to help him. They have unique ways of raising cash with baseball cards. And eventually Adam and Eve become a couple. Who would have thought?",

            "content": "Apparently, there was a time in film-making history (1999) where goofy Brendan Fraser antics and cutesy Alicia Silverstone smiles could be counted on to carry a film. Perhaps that \"played\" better in the late 90s than it does now, but for all the world this feels like a cheap, odd knock-off of 1998's \"Pleasantville\".For a basic plot summary, \"Blast from the Past\" is the story of Adam (Fraser), who is born and lives until age 35 in a fallout shelter when fanatical father (Christopher Walken) and mother (Sissy Spacek) believe the U.S. has been attacked by Russian nuclear capabilities (in reality, a plane accident on the front lawn). When \"enough time has passed to eliminate the possibility of fallout\", Adam ascends up into a world he is by no means ready for, where he meets Eve (Silverstone).There is one big problem with this movie and it is very easy to identify: They should have \"played the material straight\". \"Pleasantville\", released a year before this one, was able to take 50s nostalgia and make a poignant film out of it. \"Blast\" could have the very same type of setup, but instead chooses to go the \"farcical comedy\" route to great detriment. Every time you think the film might be on to something, it has to stoop to a cringe-worthy joke or do something ridiculous to try and justify the budding Adam/Eve relationship. Simply put, the film belongs squarely in the \"rom/com\" or even straight comedy genre, with barely a hint of serious drama or character- building present.I know that Silverstone had the \"girl-next-door cute\" thing going on for awhile and Fraser was the \"dopey hunky guy\", but (at least for me) that combination can't justify a movie like this. At times, it actually seems a bit embarrassing to see Walken & Spacek giving their all in such a sub- par effort.Thus, though potentially playing much better in the right climate (1990s), there is no getting around the fact that this isn't a quality film. It wastes a perfectly interesting setup by choosing not to pursue character development and going for the \"caricature\" approach instead.",

The son goes out into the world for the first time at 35 and tries to make his way in the big city.The movie begins well, and with Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek as a traditional fifties couple managing in the world's most elaborate fallout shelter.About 40 minutes into the movie the son reaches the surface and the movie just completely fizzles out. Somehow it seems like this is one of those movies that, had it worked well, would have seemed to have just written itself. Instead, the film falls flat. Rather than feeling like it's following a logical train of thought, it comes across as dumb and predictable.",

When their son leaves the shelter 35 years later in search of food, supplies, and a wife, hilarity ensues. The first half of the film is brilliant. It's hilarious and a very entertaining portrayal of a family living in a bomb shelter. The second half turns into a bit of a clich\u00e9 romantic comedy, but it's bearable. I'd give the first half 10/10 stars and the second half 5/10 stars.I have to say that it's the actors in this film that really make the movie work. Christopher Walken is a perfect as the father. Brendan Fraser is also quite funny as the fish-out-of-water son lost in the above-ground world. It's not an easy role to make work, but Fraser makes it work and manages to keep the audience engaged and loving the character. If you haven't seen this movie, definitely see it. It's not an Oscar worthy film, but it is a super fun ride.",

Sissy Spacek is his equal as the mom who cannot wait to resurface and abandon their luxurious shelter.

The bomb shelter scenes with Walken are this lightweight comedy's best while the storyline in L.A. is predictable and often ridiculous. The scenes with the cult our especially horrific.

Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek play the couple. The latter has a baby almost immediately and, when he's grown-up, he's sent to the surface in the late 90s where he (Brendan Fraser) experiences serious culture shock.This is an entertaining fish-out-of-water dramedy highlighted by Fraser's innocent and wide-eyed antics and Alicia Silverstone as his potential girlfriend. The bomb shelter sequences are generally dull, but the film picks up whenever Fraser or Silverstone are on screen. The film's quite good and could've been great if just a little more effort was put into fleshing out the potential of the plot and actors. Silverstone is gorgeous and effective, but somewhat underutilized. Nevertheless, \"Blast from the Past\" is a must.The film runs 112 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area.GRADE: B",

In 1962 Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek prepare for the holocaust by building an underground shelter. She is pregnant with her first child. A plane crashes on their house giving them the wrong idea and they escape down a hatch that locks automatically. Walken enters the world of the 1990's but shocked at the changes. Their son goes up in search of a wife while the father recovers from health issues. Conclusion seems hopeless in an absent-minded manner. Directed by Hugh Wilson who made the hilarious first Police Academy. Brendan Fraser brings innocence and curiosity to an amusing character whose fate is obvious. Alicia Silverstone is merely a prop who asks all the right questions yet doesn't know what viewers already know, which is that she will end up with him. Walken and Spacek are terrific in the film's premise but losing all those years by the film's end is somewhat depressing. Dave Foley plays Silverstone's gay roommate who offers Fraser a makeover but the role is not overly broad. Theme regards change and culture through time and the result is an entertaining blast of a comedy. Score: 6 \u00bd / 10",

It's nothing special, there are the awkward moments where Fraser makes you cringe, and when you realise Siverstone was once quite famous, but otherwise it's a predictable movie.What is great about the film is Walkens performance and the chemistry between the two leads, they really light the screen, and makes what otherwise is a predictable fish out of water comedy.Prepare yourself for no surprises and you will enjoy the movie.",

The supporting cast is excellent as well, both Sissy Spacek and Christopher Walken seem to have a natural comic timing, and Dave Foley as the gay friend does a good job as well. This movie is basically a fish-out-of-water story, so the script wrote itself. Most of the comedy has to do with Fraser's odd behavior, and is a collection of scenes which show how different the world is from the polite and civilized sixties, when a madman shot the president of the united states. Whatever, the formula still works, and Fraser's expressions are well worth the movie.The problem in this movie is Alicia Silverstone. During the entire run of the film, she screeches at the top of her lungs about everything. Someone please tell Hollywood that the beautiful, desirable lead woman is not instantly funnier when she yells; yelling is not a substitute for good writing. Silverstone isn't beautiful enough for her looks to redeem her poisonous behavior, angry tirades, or greedy manipulation. Every time an unpleasant, screeching harpy such as Eve appears in a movie, it does a disservice to beautiful women everywhere. Eva Mendes in \"Hitch\" is another example. No man would ever want to be with such a loud, tacky, irritating woman, no matter how beautiful she is.",

It was such an iconic cartoon soap opera teen show. This movie has the voice/actress of Braceface aka Sharon Spitz, and it's hard to separate the two because HER voice is unique. Anytime she speaks, I hear a whiny 14-year-old girl.What is the Movie about?:\nThe movie is about a frantic, couple that lived in a bomb shelter because the television said danger is coming. The couple stayed in the shelter for over 30 years with 0 human or sheeple contact. They have a child and the child lives in a shelter for over 30 years he then decides to exit the shelter and must adapt/program amongst the humans, sheeples and to the modern day slave system.What was the Story and Production like?:\nWith the honourable inclusion of Braceface aka Sharon Spitz voice, the production was fun. I consider this a What if (social experiment) movie. The acting was fine. Pacing at the beginning felt a little rushed after it slowed down to tell a fun social story of adapting to the new world order and a romance story.The story was done very well.Highlight: Realizing the voice of Braceface aka Sharon Spitz is in this movie.Intelligence Rating:\n2. Adam's parents were not intelligent. The people during the present day were not intelligent either. In away, I don't blame Adam's parents for living in a bomb shelter.Do worthless mutts appear in this movie?No, but I heard barkingIs this movie worthy?:\nSure. It was a blast full of worthiness.Should you watch this movie?: Yes, It's a great gem. I've never heard of this movie before until I bought it and I am pleased with this selection.Please watch this.",

The jokes don't work because they are well written or because they come from clever situations, but it has a goof-ball charm nevertheless and is very likable. The premise isn't a bad one but it does take a while to get going. In 1962, during the Cuban missile crisis, Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek retreat to their (exceptionally gigantic) fall-out shelter believing the Bomb has fallen and it's there that their son is born. Thirty five years later he emerges to a much changed Los Angeles in search of food, but mostly in search of a wife.It really is a one-joke movie, the innocent abroad in a world he only knows from books, and it's a joke we have seen so often before. What gives the film it's edge and it's charm is that the son is played by Brendan Fraser who displays an intuitive comic talent. He is an instinctive natural comic and he gives the film a lift. In one scene he does a loose limbed dance that is oft-kilter and sophisticated at the same time, and he's marvellous. There is nothing fresh in this film but Fraser. Alicia Silverstone is wasted as the love interest and Walken and Spacek only get to display their talents briefly and Hugh Wilson's direction is perfunctory.

Rather, I find that I do enjoy his movies, especially Airheads, and this movie was no different.In 1962 there was a little crisis called the Cuban Missile Crisis, and a paranoid inventor took his pregnant wife into a bomb shelter, just before a plane smashed into their house. Believing that Los Angeles had been destroyed in a nuclear war, they remained there for thirty odd years, until a time when the locks opened again and they were free to enter into the world. Unfortunately the inventor had a heart attack, so his son, Adam, who had never been into the real world, went out to get supplies, but unfortunately he got lost.This movie is funny, but the comedy is based mainly on the fish out of water concept, and the fact that he seems to do everything perfectly right. His name is Adam and the girl he chases is called Eve, and there was a lame joke regarding the names, but I feel that they are more important than that. Adam is basically a perfect guy. He has grown up out of the influence of the world and can do many things marvelously. Eve is a girl who is experienced with lots of guys and, though not bad, a girl that can teach Adam things. Taking the biblical idea, Eve in fact corrupts Adam into the ways of the world. It is not that they start a new world, but rather that he is inducted into the world though the woman.I guess the problem with this movie is that it requires a lot of backstory, and this is dull for one has to wade through a lot of the stuff that occurs before the actually comedy begins so that one actually gets the jokes. I really do not know how this could have been made better, but it is cause the movie to slow down, and make it irritating while waiting for the time when the actual movie begins.",

The film might not be a laugh riot but will keep a smile on your face throughout.The plot of the film is interesting and execution is good, the film will keep you engaged. The acting by the crew is strong and be it Brendan Fraser, Christopher Walken, Sissy Spacek or Dave Folly everyone were spot on.Screenplay of the film was good but in my opinion the climax of the film could've been little more elaborate as it seems that the film ends abruptly and lacks perfect closure. Over a good entertaining and funny film to watch with your family.",

I certainly found it to be a lot of fun.The basic story is fresh and has quite a lot of potential, most of which was used quite well. Many scenes were utterly hilarious and I was at times almost in tears from laughter. The joke about the poisonous gas was outstandingly funny, especially when the shopkeeper himself ran, and the whole thing with the archbishop was great.The casting and acting were great, too. Fraser is great as his innocent, funny character. He pulls it off perfectly and convincingly. Casting Walken and Spacek as his parents was an incredibly smart move. Their demeanors, like Walken's rather creepy, downbeat weirdness, and the types of films they have been in make their presence here all the more entertaining. The others, particularly Dave Foley (whom I often find pretty entertaining) and Alicia Silverstone were also great.To top it off, it was also pretty endearing.",

But, if Adam is 35 when he scouts around, that would make it 1997. And, even more confusing is the caption which reads \"present day.\" THE MOVIE WAS RELEASED IN 1999! So, why the heck did they phrase the caption like that? For this reason alone, I give this movie...2.99 stars.",

Christopher Walken and Sissy Spaceck steal the show as the lunatic, bizarre but love caring couple that support their naive son.The acting is top notch and the sexy factor is high when Alicia Silverstone wears those super short dresses and whenever she acts sexy.This is a sui generis late 90's romantic comedy.

She looked like she was from the brady brunch. Hellooooo wardrobe check! But everyone else was a delight. I just kept wishing for a different actress for Silverstone's role. That high pitched whine a la clueless kept coming out...I'm sorry, I thought she was supposed to be cynical and jaded. She sounded like a spoiled rich girl...hmmmm...sound familiar?And there was some major cornball moments between Fraser and Silverstone that had me rolling my eyes so much, it hurt.Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek are great of course.

He's stuck in the 1950s, and he meets a girl living in the present day.It's an average 'chick flick.'",

            "content": "Turned this film on late one night and started watching due to Christopher Walken's odd performance and the sci-fi theme. I found it to be a very enjoyable light comedy with touches of romance that aren't too heavy to get in the way of the essentially \"fish out of water\" nature of the comedy.The plot is pretty basic but unusual -- a 1960s scientist (Walken) in the grip of nuclear paranoia builds a futuristic fallout shelter beneath his home equipped with supplies for the 30 years he calculates will be necessary to dispel the fallout. When an airplane crashes in his back yard, he mistakes it for a nuke attack and brings his wife (Sissy Spacek) and infant son Adam (Brendan Fraser) into the shelter where they wait out the decades while educating their son to the fullest. When he emerges from the shelter to seek supplies, Adam finds the world very different than he would expect, but he and his father believe that the people have been damaged by radiation. Nevertheless he has time to fall in love with a feisty 90s girl appropriately named Eve (Alicia Silverstone) and make a gay friend (Dave Foley).The situational comedy created by Adam's strange combination of naivet\u00e9 and education create some true laugh-out-loud moments. The film is careful not to get too heavy in tone, even when navigating the troubled waters of romance and action/chase scenes. It had that kind of balanced flavor, plus the loose sci-fi elements that made it interesting, which reminded me of the \"Back to the Future\" films.The performances are solid -- Spacek and Walken are suitably weird and yet believable as 60s era adults who have been caught in a state of arrested development for decades. Fraser really packs a lot of charm in his performance, as usual. I still don't really understand why this guy's career has seemed to fade away so much. Silverstone was never that great, but this is one of her more appealing performances. And Foley was really unusual in the film, I really enjoyed his work here which was funny and human.One of the only \"romantic comedies\" from the late 90s that I would want to see again.",

We are now up to our 4th viewing in the past couple of years and BFTP continues to grow on us. It is quirky, cute and innocent with subtle layers of humour underlying the more obvious comedic moments and these layers pop up again and again throughout the movie for even more laughs.The non-typical casting is near perfect with Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek revealing a sense of comedic timing that we've rarely had a chance to see from them before. Not surprising given their history of scream movies such as Carrie or The Dead Zone.All in all this movie written by Hugh Wilson (who created my favourite TV comedy of all-time, WKRP in Cincinnati) shows us once again that he has the innate ability to wring humour out of seemingly mundane moments and belly-aching laughs out the craziest scenarios while never allowing the the audience to lose its connection with the unintended wackiness of the characters.If continuous laughs throughout an entire movie are the true indicator of the quality of a comedy then Blast From The Past is one of the funniest movies to come out in the past 20 years. If you've seen it before check it out again as the true genius of this movie can't be seen entirely the first time.Two thumbs up for a real comedic classic!!!",

            "content": "Blast From the Past is a breezy, charming story of joie-de-vivre in unfortunate circumstances. Or, rather, its introduction is. But don't worry - it's not long before it plunges into the predictably dull, slapstick romance it's destined to be, right down to a deus-ex-base-machina anchored by vintage baseball cards. Yeesh. For a movie toying with the stagnation of time, there's an exquisite irony in how adorably dated the film is, from its earnestly trendy soundtrack to its luridly antiquated gender politics. It's got a fairly engaging premise - life in a nuclear fallout bunker, and the process of reintegrating above ground \u2013 recently explored by titles like The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and 10 Cloverfield Lane. Naturally, writer/director Hugh Wilson (veteran of the daft Brendan Fraser Dudley Do-Right) under-explores the heck out of the conceit here. Unpacking the social complexities of adjusting after decades of cultural isolation (2015's Room excels at this, as an antidote)? Nah. How about endless sequences of Fraser's perennially chipper man-child gawking at cleavage, splashing around in the ocean like a puppy, or yelping sentences like \"Heather? I have NEVER heard that name before!\" It also devolves into a dopey, saccharine romance? Sure.That's not to say the film is entirely devoid of merit. Fraser's career was built around elevating lazy comedies with his doe-eyed doofus routine, and his work here demonstrates there's mileage left to milk in his irrepressible goofy charisma. He gets to show off his rubber-limbed dexterity in a dance club sequence that rips off The Mask with bare-faced audacity, and even manages to land some of his slew of tired 'fish out of water' gags to impressively enjoyable effect (particularly a distressingly literal reading of the word d*ckhead). He's not done many favours by his scene partner, though. Alicia Silverstone can do many things with her face at once, but few of them resemble any conventional emotions. Caustic, petulant, and unable to act her way out of a paper bag, her slipshod take on a quirky Gen-Xer is by far the film's low point. Cameos by Nathan Fillion as her sleazy, hunky ex and Dave Foley as Silverstone's sweetly gay roommate help somewhat. Even still, we're caught in a quagmire of mediocrity.None of this is particularly surprising. What is surprising is the film's introductory third. There's the sense that Wilson, mid-film, realized that the prospect of Christopher Walken as a wacky inventor stuck in a bunker was simply too good to pass up. Dutifully, we get more time with him and Sissy Spacek's stir-crazy, alcoholic wife raising baby-Fraser past the cursory montage we'd normally expect. This sequence feels like an entirely different movie. It's charming, wholesomely 50s, and even flirts with a character study of family dynamics under the strain of confinement (Walken appears delighted with their quarantine, while Spacek increasingly frays).Walken lives up to the opportunity, perfectly blending shades of exuberant, suave, and bonkers without flying off the handle into self-parody. Whether cracking jokes in the face of nuclear holocaust (\"A duck walks into a Pharmacy to buy some chapstick. Do you know what he says to the pharmacist? Put it on my bill.\"), giving impromptu sex-ed lessons to Fraser, or being propositioned by a drag queen while wearing a hazmat suit, he's as joyously watchable as ever. It's worth undertaking a fan edit, and trimming out all of the extraneous surface Fraser/Silverstein rubbish. Behold: Blast From the Past 2.0 - a delightful little short film of Walken, Spacek and Fraser hunkering down in a bunker, being frustrated by Fraser's inability to understand baseball. Enjoy - perhaps with a mug of hot Dr. Pepper.-5.5/10",

Too, this movie has a supercute, nay, the absolutely cutest of the cute, actress !I was really, really very, very surprised!!! - to read so many bad comments about it - I've no idea how to make it even better. For example, I don't understand why people think the Webbers' should have a radio or some device to test radioactivity - hey there where a plane falling onto their house ! Any such device had been burned away! I think if someone starts to think about such details he or she is in the wrong movie. This is excellent entertaining, but don't expect anything but a very good comedy! There are some experiments about how the behavior of the early 60's may harmonize with the behavior of the late 90's - but thats only the starting point, NOT the main focus of the script.Too, there where so many comments about Alicia Silverstone's \"bad\" acting - hey with that many acting _GIANTS_ around you you will have problems to look well, too !!! Her acting was very good, too, maybe not that supergigantic than that of the others, but even better than ever before, she even managed the romantic scenes very well, which was not her strength in the past (I think that was mainly because she didn't had many experiences with that) - and in fact I don't care too much about acting when she's entering the scene ;-).I've waited so long for the next movie of Alicia Silverstone, but now its maybe the best of her ever - even without her it would have been absolutely great ! This is definitely the movie of the month for me, and part of my personal top 10 (or even 5) of the year.

He rattles off to his nervous and uncomfortable seat-mate: \"First I have to go to the grocery store, then I have to go to a hardware store, then I have to go to a liquor store, and then I have to find a standing Holiday Inn. By the way, are you carrying a gun? No? Good, I'm really glad you're not waving it around.\" And, as an extra touch -- the guy who is so uncomfortable is one of those slightly sleazy looking city bus passengers that usually you avoid sitting next to if you can help it. (There's also a butcher at a grocery store who handles all of Brendan Fraser's bizarre questions in total deadpan. After all, this is L.A., he's seen everything, although you can tell somehow that this one is taking the cake. My wife and I wondered how many takes it took the actor to keep from laughing). My wife's very favorite scenes revolved around the elevator scenes, mentioned in numerous other reviews. Anyway, I give it a 10. We watch so many comedies where  we smile but don't actually laugh out loud, this one was nice.",

            "content": "With a title like that, it's just got to be a comedy! And so it is, though I didn't die of uncontrollable laughter.  It's a gentle comedy about a man born to parents who built themselves an underground nuclear shelter.  Born below ground, and educated extremely well by his doting parents, Adam doesn't see light of day until he is 35.  Honest, affectionate and so very naive, he yearns for a woman and goes up into the wicked world above. There's a certain pleasure in sharing Adam's first time experiences in the material word. It is refreshing to observe that money means nothing to him. He has a basketball card ( a real collector's item) worth $6000.  He says to his newly found girl friend, \" You can have this for driving me home!!\" There are little incidents like this that deserve a chuckle.  The film writer is pointing an accusing finger at us and the world generally with our distorted ideas and values.  For me, the funniest scenes involved a disreputable unshaven down and out who had had far too many drinks in the bar built over and above the nuclear shelter.  When Adam comes up through the floor and announces he is the son, the man is shaken believing he is experiencing the second coming.  When father appears, he announces that he is the father.  The man then is absolutely convinced.  Mother follows soon after and says she is the mother. The poor man collapses and I nearly did too.  It's a really funny scene that for me is one of the highlights of the film.  The nuclear shelter is incredibly luxurious, clean and tidy, with its 60's furnishings.  Suffice to say that father who built the shelter is a proclaimed genius. Mother busies herself making clothes from curtains etc. Adam's good nature, honesty and naivety give him the wherewithal to win through a series of adventures and finally to win the girl of his dreams. It pays not to question or analyse too deeply.  As I said, it's a comedy with a happy ending.  If you like this kind of theme, try \"Bad Boy Bubby\" who also discovers a crazy world beyond his lock-up.",

Probably the best so far. \"Blast from the Past\" - known here as \"Eve und der letzte Gentlemen\" (meaning \"Eve and the last gentlemen\") - is brilliant. It turned my opinion about Brendan Fraser upside down. This movie isn't clich\u00e9. This isn't an usual romantic comedy (aka spasm ;-) a l\u00e1 Maid in Manhattan or Kate and Leopold. This one is different. I won't spoil, but for short it's about two parents (living in 1961) and especially about their son who wasted half of his life in an underground bomb shelter. Finally after 35-yrs he has his first peek at the \"new world\". Everything has changed -- and their house is gone :) Basically he's sent on food hunt and by the way he's trying to find a \"wife\". Well, probably not the best description, but I can only repeat myself: this one was simply hillarious. It made me laugh all the time, it stirred up my feelings when it came to the more serious aspects, and I was impressed by the acting. Simply great.I give it a comedy/romance rating of 9 out of 10.

            "content": "Brendan Fraser has always had a field day with parts that linger on his ability to act like an innocent school boy. That was put to the test in his breakout role \"George of the Jungle\", the rather mindless \"Dudley Do-Right\" and yet here again in this rather white washed fish out of water story, Blast from the Past.Not that there aren't things to admire here, especially the totally believable performance by Fraser. You actually believe that he has been isolated for 34 years with only his parents as company and his rather amusing observations when he surfaces for the first time above ground are priceless. How fun could it be for all of us if we discovered something for the first time like he does for almost half of the movie's running time.When Eve, the girl that he eventually has to fall in love with comes into the act, the whole movie makes a depressing u-turn. Not that there is anything wrong with Alicia Silverstone's performance as the jaded and cynical Eve, but even though Fraser's character, Adam is a virgin he is not clueless and the way he makes Eve fall for him without much of an effort was a major disappointment plot wise. We sense that even though Fraser is supposed to be the awkward one, he is still much too cool for Silverstone.The last half of the movie deals with Eve freaking out when Adam finally tells her the truth about his existence. But wouldn't you know it, Eve has a complete change of heart at the end and we get to the happy ending (could it have ended another way, not likely).There are two magnificent performances from Chris Walken and Sissy Spacek as Adam's parents and the obligatory best friend of Eve's, who of course is gay (Kids in the Hall'er, Dave Foley). Walken is good as the crazy scientist and Spacek has a less flashy role but still has some good moments as the woman who just longs for her freedom some day. Foley is a lot less annoying than he could have been as the stereotypical effeminate gay guy. He is actually quite sympathetic and not totally \"flaming\" as is the case with the Jack character from \"Will and Grace\".After all this is the movies and it is nice to see that there still were directors who cared about a story and were not only interested in how many fart jokes and how much nudity they could get into one movie. The late 90's were full of those schlock-fests like American Pie and its imitators.Fraser may never win an Oscar but he has been one of the most consistently likable screen presences for almost 2 decades and therefore more power to him. I'm looking forward to his next Mummy adventure, out in 2008.",

The basic set-up is a nice conceit that sees our hero, Adam Webber (Fraser), being born and raised in a nuclear fallout shelter, after his parents make it their home when they mistakenly believe a nuclear war has broken out between the US ans Russia in the early sixties. His parents (Walken and Spacek - both brilliant in their respective roles) bring their son up to be a \"gentleman\", socially adept, articulate, engaging and respectful of others. Of course, all of this clashes with the attitudes of the populace when he is forced to visit the outside world.A chance encounter with Eva Rustikov (Silverstone - other than Clueless, never better)leads to a series of misadventures in which they both learn new values. He gets an education in the very different world of 1999 and she gets a few lessons in humility and humanity.The plot is nicely judged and the incidental characters are realised well. The payoff in the last couple of scenes with Walken are both funny and poignant.This is a feel good movie - warm and unassuming. Don't look for plot holes, goofs or inaccuracies.

Fish-out-of-water stories have the potential to be enjoyable if competent actors of some calibre are included in the package. The actors are certainly not the problem here. They do their best with what they're given and charm us at every turn. Nonetheless, the plot often seems to lack focus and direction going off on several tangents that sometimes seem be left hanging in mid-air and unresolved. The ending also left me a little dissatisfied.That said, however, I found myself nostalgic for good manners and common courtesies, which the film suggests is somewhat lacking in the nineties.

Encino Man, George Of The Jungle, the recently released The Mummy and now Blast From The Past deliver what have been a refreshing retinue of upstanding characters; a welcome relief in these cynical, nasty 'nineties.Blast From The Past is one of those innocent into civilisation films in the tradition of Nell, Bad Boy Bubby, The Truman Show, nearly all of the Star Trek flicks and many more, including Frankenstein; movies where at least for a significant segment, the central character is plagued by the inconsistencies and untruthfulness of modern society.That Blast From The Past achieves this with a good deal of charm, plenty of wit and a fair amount of lightly delivered social comment is testament to it being well worth a viewing.There's a long prologue, which is probably the most entertaining section. Christopher Walken plays Calvin. He's a rich rocket scientist who's built a fantastic bomb shelter under his house, one which seems to mirror his house in many respects.It's Cuban missile crisis time in the U.S. and on the night that Kennedy lays down the rules to the Russians on Calvin's black and white T.V.. After Calvin has ushered his pregnant wife Helen, (played absolutely delightfully by Sissy 'Carrie' Spacek), into the fallout shelter, a war plane mistakenly falls onto the house convincing the pair that the bomb has been dropped. They lock the doors for 30 years to avoid radiation.Walken and Spacek flesh out their characters beautifully. Calvin seems content in his retreat, happy to maintain the life support systems he has built to keep the three of them alive. Their son, who they aptly call Adam (played by Brendan Fraser when Adam starts to look for his oats) joins them only a few days after the lock in.But how might Calvin's character evolve when he emerges from his crypt and finds out that a bomb wasn't dropped after all? That's for you to find out. His behaviour isn't surprising, it's obvious really, but sometimes the obvious can be enlightening.And how might Mum react to 30 years locked in with her two men. She might become a quietly desperate dipsomaniac. I wish Sissy Spacek would act in more films.In Bad Boy Bubby (Australia's terrific and rather sick nod to the Blast From The Past genre), Bubby emerged from his crypt and had a cult develop around him. Blast From The Past takes the same road but whereas Bubby was a fractured soul, Brendan Fraser's Adam is as pure as the proverbial driven snow, good looking and a great dancer to boot.One of his missions is to find an Eve and bring her back to the shelter. Dad is convinced that most of the women must be mutants up there and we'd be left wondering if maybe that really is true, at least in comparison to the sweet boy that is Adam.Mum in one of her hilariously droll murmurs just hopes that Adam might find one that doesn't glow in the dark and for some reason comes from Pasadena.Eve is played by Alicia 'Clueless' Silverstone. She's scatty, shallow and the required nice girl at heart for this type of movie. She has her doubts about Adam, of course, and in the one big plot blunder in Blast From The Past calls in the authorities, but she's better than the wallpaper for the film that many actresses would have been.I don't need to tell you that it all turns out well in the end. That's obvious from the opening credits. But I must hasten to encourage you to take the appropriate position, one that will allow you to kiss your bum goodbye - if the bomb ever does drop. Nothing else will help. Meanwhile at least we can have a good knowing giggle at the movies.",

This is kind of a chick flick, but really shouldn't be missed by anyone.",

The high-concept story revloves around a brainy scientist (a terrific Christopher Walken) who locks himself and his very pregant wife (Sissy Spacek) in his fallout shelter in 1962 when nuclear war seems imminent.  The couple's now-grown son emerges 35 years later, and his odd mannerisms, child-like innocence and obvious social differences provide the imaginative spark that allows Fraser to play comically against the worldly, jaded Silverstone.  Blast From the Past does not, unfortunately, exploit the richest possiblities inherent in its premise, but it does have a certain guilelessness and charm.",

            "content": "SPOILERSA funny, sweet fable about a family living in a fall-out shelter for thirty-five years. Adam (Brendan Fraser,) the son who's never been outside, is totally naive but very eager to meet the woman of his dreams when he finally gets out in the world; he's still a virgin.There's a funny subplot about the spaced-out hippy owner of a porn shop who believes God in several forms has arrived on the shelter's elevator. Of course, a small cult springs up.As Adam's parents, Calven (Christoper Walken in an atypical role) is suitably dull but still manages to be quirky; and Helen (Sissy Spacek) is delightfully dutiful with a streak of independence.Adam is a chameleon, swinging from dork to hunk merely by changing outfits, unpleating his forehead and dancing like a dream, a skill his mom taught him down in he shelter. The dance sequence, with two stunning blondes, is weirdly out of place, and yet fits in like a scene from an old musical.Eve (Alicia Silverstone) is a beautiful, cynical, world-weary idealist, and her idealism finally wins out thanks in part to Troy (Dave Foley) a \"happy\" friend, as described by Adam. How else could it possibly end but happily?",

            "content": "[Warning:  This review may contain spoilers.]Given the premise of this film, I expected it to be the predictable Hollywood hatchet job, on American (especially Cold War) culture.  Boy, was I wrong!This is one sweet movie.  When I say sweet, I mean, Mayberry sweet.  And just as that American staple from the sixties was beloved and sincere, so is, \"Blast From The Past.\"Of course this film sits on an implausible premise.  The family squirreled away for decades in an underground bunker is certainly impossible.  It doesn't matter.  This is merely the prism used by the filmmaker to compare and contrast late nineties culture with early sixties values.The difference is compelling and jackhammer hard.  I'm not sure to credit the writer, Bill Kelly, or the director, Hugh Wilson with \"Blast's\" message. Perhaps both and others.  The fact remains that at almost every intersection, where Hollywood would demand the old clinical satire, rubber stamped by the Politically Correct, \"Blast\" charts original territory and maintains the philosophy throughout.  This is real filmmaking, folks, where the makers shuck timely formula for principle.The non-cheesy, kind-heartedness of Adam will definitely come out after repeated viewings.  I dare you to not cry for joy, after you become familiar with this picture.  Eight out of Ten, perhaps I should have given it Nine.I want to make one thing clear.  This film does not epitomize empty propaganda purporting the superiority of the \"old days.\"  Nor does it make Hollywood's nauseous mistake of glorifying nineties moral superiority over America's supposed \"dumber days.\"  The compelling contrast is tastefully done, and hopefully, critical minds, learned in thought will see the balance.  It just may irk some that the balance of positives rest with the values and grace of times gone.  I have the optimisitic feeling that the kernel of the past may become the flower of our future.",

It is nostalgic, romantic, funny, humbling and witty.

Why is Brendan Frashure so cheerful after being cooped up in an underground bomb shelter with nobody but his parents for 35 years (even one as luxurious as this one)?  With all that time on their hands, why didn't his parents have another baby to keep him company?  Why didn't the father (supposedly a genius) have a radio underground so he could keep in touch with the world outside the bomb shelter?  Still I was willing to suspend my disbelief.  The film's makers maintain a fast pace and a light touch throughout (attributes the plodding and heavy-handed \"Pleasantville\" could have used in abundance) and the cast is wonderful.  Walken puts his usual persona of menacing eccentricity to refreshingly benign use, Spacek is always fun when she's being ditsy and Alicia Silverstone finds the right blend of hope and cynicism.  Dave Foley is good in the 90's equivalent of the Eve Arden role of the 40's.  The best friend and confidante of the leading lady is now an unthreatening gay man.  (The writers carefully avoid having him fall for Frashure himself.)  But it's buoyant Brendan who really keeps the whole movie afloat.  Just when you think you don't want to see him playing any more \"child men\" he finds wonderful new nuances in the role. All-in-all, good fun.  Loved the sequence in the 40's nightclub.",

During this time, they have a son (Fraser) and raise him in this shelter into his 30s. What happens after the baracade's time lock releases them, is that the son ventures above ground into a different world and time (1990s) to gather supplies for the shelter. As you can guess, he suffers a bit of a culture shock. He encounters Silverstone's character (the first female he's ever seen besides his mother), and develops a crush on her. Through a series of events that the two characters go through, Silverstone's character realizes that she's fallen in love with Fraser, and vice versa.Keep in mind, I've simplied the main plot but the point is that it really isn't that strong a plot. You could miss pieces of the movie and not really miss anything at all. There are some nice moments but in the end I really didn't feel like I was into the movie. The humor was good in some parts but quite often it just wasn't that funny.Overall, this isn't a bad movie, but, it isn't a good movie either.

How he came to be born in a Nuclear Fall Out Shelter as big as a warehouse stuffed full of every conceivable product including a trout farm and external heat detectors but not a Geiger Counter constitutes a largely irrelevant prologue but stick with it as the Love Story between Adam and Eve eventually leaves a very warm feeling and probably before Adam.

The soundtrack also matches the mood and reflects well the eras and passages of time.

His innocence, intelligence, genteel charm, and strength both physical and emotional all show in his performance. I believe that those who see him as a one dimensional character are wrong and should see this as well as Gods And Monsters in which he also gave an excellent performance.

Although certain inconsistencies between our reality and the movie's are extremely evident, they needn't be dwelled upon. Brendan Fraser's performance in this movie is somewhat goofy but genuinely endearing, the parents (Walken and Spacek) are hilarious, and Alicia Silverstone also carries off her role serviceably, but not as well as the other actors in this film.

            "content": "This is a little belter of a film. Not an Oscar winner by a long way, but one of those films where you emerge from the cinema grinning from ear to ear and reckoning you have just had two hours of entertainment.Christopher Walken plays Calvin Weber, a Communist-paranoid egghead only just this side of sane. So worried is he about the Communist threat that he builds an underground shelter for when the balloon goes up. During the Cuban missile crisis, an air crash convinces him things are going to get very hot and noisy, so he heads for the shelter with his slightly dotty wife Helen (played with a great deal of glee by Sissy Spacek; where has she been for the last n years?), sealing the locks to prevent them going out for 35 years, by which time he calculates the radiation will have subsided.Helen is pregnant, and gives birth to Adam, who for the first 35 years of his life lives underground in the shelter, which is eerily designed to look like the neighbourhood the Webers are sure has been destroyed. Helen even goes \u0091shopping' for food in a reproduction of the local grocery store. As time goes on both Calvin and Helen go slightly (more) mental, while doing their level best to bring up Adam to uphold the early 60s values they espouse - politeness, the importance of education, all nuclear family stuff (and I am sure that gag occurred to director Hugh Wilson and writer Bill Kelly).35 years having elapsed, Adam is sent out to get new supplies, and there is a shift to the more familiar territory of a tale of an innocent abroad. However, it is all played with a great deal of charm and sense of fun, and the underlying joke never goes stale. Brendan Fraser as Adam is convincing as the intelligent but dumb, unworldly young man anxious to find a girl (\u0091One that doesn't glow in the dark' quips Calvin), getting lost in the big wide world, and encountering the hard bitten, streetwise Eve. Alicia Silverstone carries this role beautifully, and also gets some of the best lines. During one conversation with Adam, she wails \u0091It never works out with me and men!' When asked by Adam exactly why not, she says \u0091Because men always seem to go for my legs, or my butt, or my hair, or any combination of the three.' \u0091So what's the problem? I think you are very attractive.' \u0091The problem is that I go for legs, butts, and hair too. So I end up with guys who are even more shallow than I am. (Pause) If you can imagine that.'Adam recruits Eve to help him stock up on supplies for the shelter, and also to try to find him a wife, and she reluctantly agrees (\u0091What sort of girl do you want?' \u0091One who isn't a mutant.' \u0091Oh right, no dogs huh?'). She is aided and abetted by her gay flatmate Troy, played with just the right degree of campness by David Foley (who he? IMDB here I come.). And guess what? She falls for Adam, but she really, really falls for him. This dawns on her during an excruciatingly funny sequence in a retro dancehall, where Adam clears the floor by jiving with two beautiful strangers (he has been taught to dance by his mother), and then falls into the clutches of femme fatale Sophie, whom Eve cannot abide.It all looks as if it will work out when Adam later returns to Eve's apartment, but foolishly she asks him where he is from. His honest reply leads her to suspect he is completely barking, and she sends for the authorities to pick him up. Adam escapes, but as he goes tells Eve and Troy go to his hotel room to tidy up his possessions. Troy finds some stock certificates that Calvin bought for Adam in the early 60s, and it dawns on Eve that Adam was telling the truth. Eve then gets another great line as she admits to Troy she was wrong. Troy:\u0091Eve, you met the nicest, gentlest, politest, kindest\u0085' Eve:\u0091Richest\u0085.' Troy:\u0091\u0085richest young man you have ever met\u0085.' Eve:\u0091And I tried to have him committed\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085.'I will not say how it resolves itself, but it involves a long running subplot about a religious cult, and a riotously funny scene in an adult video store.This is a terrific feelgood film, but the way in which Calvin and Helen fall apart over time lends it a more serious, darker edge. Great performances, cracking script, neat direction, clever camerawork, and costume design that strays into the inspired (in the scenes just before Adam leaves the bunker, see if you can spot where his jacket came from).Magic, and good value for money. See it. I am not exaggerating how good this is.",

His character was naive, clueless, charismatic and hunky, just about the same role that he plays in \"Blast from the Past\", but that's OK, because it works! In this film he and his family have been in a funky fallout shelter for 35 years, thinking that there has been an atomic blast in 1962.  The set for the fallout shelter is very imaginative and true to the style of the '60's. The family's life below ground is portrayed in a funny and clever manner, as they take you through 35 years of coping with a limited environment and human contact of the closest kind.  But finally the day comes when the doors unlock and up comes the family.  The first meetings that they have with the \"mutants\" are hilarious.  Once Brendan is wandering around on the surface, the film gets a little more predictable, but it is always fun.Sissy Spacek and Christopher Walken are excellent as Mom and Pop, funny, eccentric and endearing.

Where is more of Christopher Walken when you need him? Besides the premise and Walken, what is there to like about this movie?\"Blast From the Past\" represents a neat, little idea that, quite unfortunately, got caught up in the Hollywood press and the typical hype.

This is a movie that should have had a lower budget, actors instead of movie stars (Christopher Walken not withstanding), and should've been directed by a talented indie who knows this type of bizarro material.My dream \"Blast From the Past\": A satiric, laugh-out-loud comedy, rewritten and directed by John Waters.

Basically everything works in this sympathetic little film, from Silverstone's gay friend ***** minor spoilers (Not surprisingly Fraser never gets the message when Silverstone describes her friend as such) to the Archbishop and his weird collection of devoted followers who think they have seen Jesus, his father and mother Mary pop out of their underground dwelling. ***** I think the script writer and director managed to squeeze about every conceivable time lapse misconception in the scenario in a way that works and skipped the overly obvious ones that would have made this film a corny event. Nowhere the film lapses into a cheap series of \"Seve Martin/Leslie Nielsen\" type jokes just for the sake of inducing a laugh. Focus remains with the inevitable storyline, which is rather predictable, something that can ruin a film, but sometimes work in its favour, as it does here. A heart warming pastime, well worth taking up space in your DVD collection. Watching such a film one could easily be tempted to think making it was a breeze.

Take a cast, two of which are synonymous with bad movies (Walken, Spacek), and one who has not appeared in any recent pictures (Silverstone), and watch them struggle through this movie.  At times, I couldn't tell if Silverstone was playing Cher from \"Clueless,\" Emily from \"Excess Baggage,\" or her \"too cool\" 90's character Eve.  Walken, who has gone downhill since \"A View to a Kill,\" continues to gain my sympathy for staying in the business.  As far as plot goes, even far-fetched movies need certain elements of reality, and those elements are clearly lacking from the film.  Adam, for instance, speaks French fluently, yet he has no concept of homosexuality?  As far as characters go, Spacek plays an annoying mother to Adam who practically begs the audience to laugh at her. And Eve's overly-stereotypical-homosexual friend just makes you want to beat him senselessly.

The subtext of the comedy, i.e. that if you were raised with only decent parents and no outside influences (and your dad happens to be a slightly wacky genius) you might actually be a great person lends weight to what might otherwise be a bit of fluff.  Walken and Spacek are brilliant as usual, Dave Foley, formerly of Kids in the Hall fame, is hilarious as the wise roomie of Alicia Silverstone. The side stories especially of the gradually rundown soda jerk, are wonderful.  Worth the rental and then some. Even if you watch it only for the sherbet-colored world of 1962.",

Walken is the Commie-crazed father who buries his family in a fall-out shelter. Spacek is the 50s- or 60s-era housewife who goes bonkers from the isolation and enjoys her Champagne cocktails a little too much.The script, despite a truly contrived plot, does show some moments of good writing. One in particular has Silverstone and Foley playing off one another as she tries to discover Fraser's whereabouts. Plenty of goofy and smile-inducing \"out of his element\" humor, too.Fraser does a great job playing his all-too usual comedic role -- the lunk-headed hero. Silversone also dips into her past performances but manages to be undeniably cute as the pouty Eve.The verdict? Good date-and-popcorn movie, but other than that, just a so-so film with a better than average cast.",

The main character Adam (Brendan Fraser) lives for 35 years of his life there and this part of the film is quite boring but then when he gets on to the streets of modern Los Angeles it gets much more interesting especially when Eva (Alicia Silverstone) enters the film. She is a real pleasure for the eyes. Summarizing it's an interesting family comedy with elements of fantastic and it's an average one: not great but not poor either.

            "content": "(Hints at ending but no real spoiler.) Believe me, I don't like writing negative reviews about something a lot of people have worked hard on - but it's difficult to be positive about Blast From The Past. It had an interesting plot and could perhaps have worked, if approached differently. Billed as a romantic comedy, this movie wasn't funny enough to be comic, and lacked the plausibility and emotional realism to be romantic. I admit, it had humorous moments, but mostly from minor characters. Brendan Fraser played the well meaning but basically weird guy stuck in a 1960s time warp. I really wanted to like his character, who could have been charming and sympathetic, and still had amusing quirks. As it was, Adam was completely over-acted and sent up for laughs, making him way too wacko to be in the least bit believable as a human being. The character had so much scope but ended up a joke. Forrest Gump proves that a lead role can be laughable and still make the audience care - so BFTP has no excuse. A disappointment from a talented actor. Best stick to fighting mummies, Brendan. Alicia Silverstone was the tart without a heart who was supposed to fall in love with Adam, but this stretched the `willing suspension of disbelief' way too far. After half an hour of watching her totally annoying, shallow and sour character, Eve, I was ready to reach for the stop button. I haven't seen her in many films but this one did nothing to endear me to Ms. Silverstone. The supporting cast were more impressive but sadly not enough to redeem BFTP. Maybe I missed the point with this film, but after watching Blast From the Past I felt cheated of my evening and my money. Watch it if you like.. but don't say I didn't warn you!",

            "content": "This film had everything going for it except one \u2013 the decadent attitude of the makers. The characteristic of decadence is that it believes in nothing, yet it feeds off anyone who believes in something. The film is obviously an expansion on the joke \"Have you been living in a bomb shelter all these years!\", but the slant on it is, \"let's make fun on fifties morality\". That's cheap. Good for a joke, but not for a full length film. If it needs to be stretched out into a film then fifties morality has to be built up before shooting it down. Therefore a good chunk of the film is taken up building fifties morality in the nuclear shelter of Calvin and his family. Since the makers have no respect for this kind of life, it comes across as unintended satire. We are supposed to laugh at crazy people minding morals and manners in a dugout, and at the same time we are not supposed to laugh, because morals and manners will become heroic qualities for the protagonist later on in the film. So it's, whatever suits the plot at any particular time. In other words, decadence! If they believed that fifties morality is bad, then we would have satire. If they believed it was good then we would have a sweet romantic comedy. But the people involved don't believe in anything really, and they are happy to maintain a snickering, subversive attitude throughout. Using all their skills in exploitation and manipulation, their purpose is no get a passable film together, meant for the shallow masses, who like them also believe in nothing. Except, of course, the quick buck.Taking all this into account, it's a good effort. Entertaining, and some good performances. Christopher Walken is particularly good. The premise is extremely far-fetched, and a lot of effort is gone into making it believable. Despite the efforts, it's barely believable to begin with, it stops being believable at all after Adam grows up and walks into the real world. This is where comedy is meant to tide things over, and it required a deft and conscientious touch to work. But it all goes wrong. It's heavy handed and insensitive most of the way. The heart of the film is not in the right place. We don't appreciate all the fun made of morality and manners. Not when the film itself is about the preciousness of morality and manners in the nihilistic nineties.",

He's also an idiot because he doesn't understand (I guess) what he's saying in any of them. The time comes for the family provisions to be replenished. Also, slurs Mom, for the son to get a nice, healthy wife! The son emerges to the surface and is greeted by a nightmarish vision of an apocalyptic Sodom & Gomorrah. His first verbal contact with a female is with a demeaning, scatterbrained floozy who puts him down at every turn. Naturally, he falls madly in love with her. Finally she accepts to go out with him, but dumps him as soon as she sees an ex boyfriend. (She is only attracted, she says, by guys with great butts!) The only possessions our \"hero\" took upon leaving his vault, were a cigar box full of old baseball cards (the value of which he knows nothing), and some bonds. Together, these make him a billionaire and the promiscuous shrew he's enamored of realizes she loves him too. Next step is to demolish for miles around all the area surrounding his underground retreat, landscape the grounds, and build a pretty house.

Yet, Hollywood keeps making these type of movies, and they, for the most part, are almost always entertaining (George of the Jungle, anything by Tim Burton, etc.).  I don't know how they do it, time and time again, but Hollywood has done it again with Blast From the Past.I loved this movie from the very beginning.  It opens with the two adult leads, played by Christopher Walken (in a terrific role, playing against his stereotype), and Sissy Spacek (also terrific) throwing a party.Sure, the movie is predictable.  But it's a lot of fun.  Fraser is terrific in the role of someone who hasn't left his parents side for 35 years.  The writing is lighthearted and fun, and everyone involved seems to be having a good time.The only real problem I had with the film involve a running gag about the resident of the building directly above the fallout shelter.  This was funny for a while, but they took the joke too far, and by the end, the joke got old.  The film was also a tad overlong, and the score was kind of lame at times.But these are very minor complaints, when you take into account how good the movie is as a whole.

            "content": "Rating:   2 1/2 starsThe Cuban missile crisis is looming. Prepared for such a potential catastrophe, Calvin (Christopher Walken) and Amanda (Sissy Spacek) Webber are waiting for the right moment to enter their state of the art bomb shelter which was secretly built below there home. Of course that moment arrives.Calvin is a scientific genius, a self-made millionaire (From patented inventions), and incredibly paranoid as he is sure the Cuban missile crisis is the inevitable catalyst to the end of the world, as we know it. His wife, Amanda (Sissy Spacek) is a stereotypical 1950's-type housewife.Calvin, in the middle of his house party, interprets a radio broadcast as his cue to enter the bomb shelter. He abruptly asks his guests to leave, his pregnant wife and himself enter the shelter just as an explosion occurs above. He thinks it's the end. It was only a disabled military jet that crashes into his home. He sets the time lock to exit at 35 years in the future when it will be safe to re-enter the atmosphere. His son, Adam (Brendon Fraiser) is born and raised for 35 years in the bomb shelter with all of the knowledge and morals of the late 1950's.The best moments of this movie were during the 35-year span in the shelter as Adam was being raised. Simultaneously, above the shelter, we see the construction of a soda shop that's operated by a mother and son (Joey Slotnick). We see them, along with their business, drastically change with the times. The writers during this part of the movie were creative, original, and funny.Question: As Adam walked out of the bomb shelter and into the light, did the writers feel this was a good time to walk out on the movie? The movie became the typical (Actually written better than typical) Hollywood formula of:1) Boy meets the beautiful girl, (Eve played by Alicia Silverstone) in which the writers assumed we were stupid enough to think that they could force such a quick and unlikely relationship with.2) Boy wants girl but must overcome the usual obstacles.3) Boy gets girl.4) And finally, let's have the, which is painfully obvious, happy ending.Performances were quite good. The real standout character was the soda jerk (Joey Slotnick). His character made several changes along the movie. He went from a 1950's style soda jerk to a burned out drugged induced and lost in the past hippie style figure. Watching these changes along with Joey's performance was a lot of fun.Generally speaking, the movie in itself was a lot of fun but its potential was never fulfilled. I don't understand how a script can be so strong in the first third and then neglected for the remainder. The writer's were good enough to have funny moments even in the formulated areas.I do recommend this movie. Most of this review was spent describing the 35-year span because this was the area that the writer's placed most of their efforts. Overall, this is a pretty funny and fun movie but it could have been so much more.",

Unfortunately all of the goodwill that he built up in Deer Hunter, and to a lesser extent Pulp Fiction, was spoiled by this stinker. This movie is absolutely dreadful. I expect Brendan Fraser to sign up for junk like this and his terrible performance is not out of character, but Christopher Walken!?!?!? Say it isn't so! It is! He was horrible, the story was horrible, and the script was horrible! Basically their family believes that a nuclear bomb goes off, they climb into a bomb shelter for 35 years, and then come out to find a new world. All attempts at humor fail miserably, skip this movie. If you want a laugh pick up 'Thank You For Smoking' or 'Caddyshack.'",

Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek play his parents and they're fantastic, we spend a lot of the first half of the movie with them and it works well. Alicia Silverstone plays the love interest trying not to fall for Fraser as she helps him gather what he's looking for on the surface world, she's giving the same performance she always does. Dave Foley plays the gay roommate and this was not a bad character, he's played this character on KITH a million times but they wrote the character around some pitfalls so he doesn't feel fully fleshed out, but he's not a total cliche.The movie's got charm, but not enough laughs, and misses some logic to the way the story moves throughout. It's \"cute\" but feels like it could have been raucously funny or a smarter, better story at nearly every moment.After the halfway mark, the film loses steam until we get to a very forced ending, literally coughed up in the moment to create the dramatic finale, and it doesn't quite work for it.That said, I would absolutely watch a sequel starring Walken, Spacek, and Fraser in those same roles made today.",

Alicia Silverstone, as his newfound friend, finally approaches the likeability she displayed in 'Clueless'. The movie is slow moving in spots, but has its funny moments and an overall endearing quality. In all, any movie that chooses Randy Newman's 'Political Science' as the music for its final images can't be all bad. Seven out of ten.",

I saw it in the theatres 3 times, and enjoyed every minute (well, there were a few things I would edit, mostly just some language).I now have this on DVD, and each time I play it for (new) friends, all agree it is very enjoyable.  Even my children, ages 9, 15 and 18, are (unusually) in agreement that this is a good film.  The scenes and music in the fall-out shelter have a very comfortable and, well, 'sheltered' feeling with the music really complimenting the story which then contrasts sharply with the music Adam hears when he \"goes up top\".Though Silverstone is very pessimistic through most of the film and somewhat irritating, Fraser and Silverstone's gay friend in the film (and Adam's innocent reaction to him) steal the show.  The \"fish out of water story\" is always, for me, a wonderful way to see things that one normally takes for granted.Highlights for me:  the 'religious experience', the dance club scene, and \"remember, it's important that we all remain calm\" scene.  Actually scene after scene.You can't lose with this film -- rent it or buy it.",

Unless the intention is to parody some genre or some other work, comedy should be based on some reality, however wispy it may be.

Going in to see this movie, I never did appreciate Brendan Fraser, the actor; however, after his performance in Blast From The Past; I have come to like him. Fraser portrayed his character, Adam Webber, with innocence just as Brad Pitt did in Meet Joe Black. Living in a bomb shelter underground for the first thirty-five years of his life, Adam is in search of a girl as well as supplies for his parents. Alicia Silverstone is gorgeous on and off screen. Alicia Silverstone reminds me of another actress with blonde hair named Drew Barrymore. Silverstone plays a girl aptly named Eve. One of the big cast surprises was Christopher Walken who teamed with Alicia in Excess Baggage. Walken is Calvin Webber, an oddball genious scientist. I love Christopher Walken because he isn't the villan as he is accustomed to in past roles. Blast From The Past kept me smiling from start to finish. This is movie for the whole family to see.

            "content": "I love Alicia Silverstone, I own \"Excess Baggage\", \"The Crush\", \"Scorched\", and soon \"Batman and Robin\" (not because it's good, merely for comedic value, believe me) here was my problem.The movie begins with Adam in the bomb shelter, being born, etc. Basically everything that happens up to 35 years later, they show lots of stuff: Adam learning different languages, learning to box, dancing, lots of stuff. My first suggestion would have been to cut a few minutes off the beginning, I know that sounds nuts but hear me out. There was a lot of stuff that didn't really need to be there, it was about half an hour until Adam finally meets Eve. So we follow this lost puppy without an opposite for a while, it actually is tough to call because a lot of the beginning was necessary, a few minutes less would have made it better. I'm sorry but it really did drag a bit.The second problem, Eve, Alicia is generally a very sweet, quirky, cute girl. In this she was for lack of a better word: a complete bitch. So here we have this guy, trying to find a woman and the character that was written in this instance is offering him nothing but contempt, which is what I found very unsettling considering what this movie was aiming for.She does eventually warm up too him... when the movie is ALMOST over. So let me just recap this for you readers, We spend 30 minutes building up Adam as a character, have about 30 minutes of a character that treats him pretty badly, then we have maybe 15 minutes of sweetening, they remain off screen for another 15 minutes, then it ends. I felt a little ripped off. There were no moments of any closure for this relationship, I'm not joking, if he'd stare at her it would be \"STOP STARING AT ME!\", yes, it's funny, but it hurts the characters relationship believability.It not being as ROMANTIC as some would like wouldn't have been a problem if the subject matter would have been a little lighter hearted, I mean, we have a family down in a shelter for 35 years, you can't help but feel sorry for this guy. Then he gets harped on for a majority of the movie, then all of a sudden, a REALIZATION of LOVE? I just didn't buy it, the two had only known each other for a couple days... okay... same went for Excess Baggage, but at least with EB we SAW the connections being made earlier than the 80 minute mark, I believed the characters feelings in Excess Baggage, I really did. This one just didn't do it I'm afraid.The points go for some sweet moments, a funny fight scene, Dave Foley was really good and gets 3 points alone, and the soundtrack was pretty cool. Overall, if you really want a light hearted comedy with some really sweet moments,you can't go wrong with Excess Baggage or Scorched. Or this either really, depending on what you're looking for.",

Apart from the jokes not being particularly funny and the \"funny sequences\" too overacted/too easily predicted, I really questioned the conservative moral which seemed to be the basis of the exercise: The leading idea seemed to be to hold up Brendan Fraser's character (too overacting to be considered really human, by the way;-)as a kind of positive counterforce to the presumed degenerated manners of present days' people. Surely, I'm not an opponent of politeness etc but this \"everything was really better in the good old days\"-attitude really did get on my nerves.

Well, not surprisingly it leads Adam Webber's dear old mother to heavily drinking.  This was good even after a somewhat slow start.  They spend too much time in the shelter watching him grow up.  Although I can understand why.  I mean you have a talent like Christopher Walken you want to use it.  Some of those scenes work and, overall, do set up the movie well. It just gets it off to a bumpy start.  But after getting past that point the movie sails much smoother.Fraser plays the naive young man who doesn't know anything about our world today.  Fascinated by the sky the ocean and excited to see a Negro.  (his words mine no hate mail please) Silverstone plays the aimless attractive young woman whose relationships have left her in her current jaded state. Fraser's innocents and gentleman charm which is unheard of to the characters of this movie wins her heart.  Fraser discovering this modern world had plenty of funny moments and the rest of the cast helped carry the rest of the movie along.Silverstone was at her best since at least Clueless, maybe her best ever (although I realize that isn't saying much if you're going by movies like Batman).  David Foley was great and had many of the funny moments in this movie.  Some of the scenes did not work like when at the end of the movie it's in slow motion. I see what they were trying but it just didn't work for me.  Other scenes like the cult that had started to worship them did work well although the early scenes that set it up will puzzle you for awhile.

It looked EXACTLY like the dancing I see in clubs here all  the time. People DO dance that way. It looked REAL to me, not like Fred Astaire but the way I see people actually dance. Poor footworkand all. But the aerials were dead on...for what I see on the floor in average, everyday, non competition situations.Besides, following the premise, it was the first time he'd danced with anyone besides his mom. Does ANYONE dance perfectly the first time out with a new partner?I've also heard comments from friends about Adam doing swing vs 60's dances...well, I was born in 1965 and MY parents didn't own any \"rock and roll\" either. They were older - my mom was 30 when I was born - and in fact a lot like Adam's parents. I got the Lettermen, Sinatra, the 4 Lads, the Kingston Trio, Lambert Hendricks and Ross, Tom Lehrer, a tonof Broadway soundtracks and I think one lone Chubby Checker lp from their \"when I born\" collection. The Twist was a pretty radical modern dance in 62. It was also a \"fad\" and the subject of much lampooning at the time.A friend of mine said: \"Brendan Fraser's clothes were lame again ...\"They were SUPPOSED to be. His mom made them from old curtains and bedspreads and recycled other clothes. You COULD say, hey, why didn't they pack more clothes, but when they were outfitting the shelter, Mom never thought they'd need it, and Dad was more concerned with the geeky techno survival aspect to consider wardrobe. He was a GUY, after all, and he was thinking more about the bar and the TV than he was about what he was gonna wear in 30 years. If he had been thinking that, he would have packed a spare pair of glasses, too.Of course, the minute Adam went above ground, he'd have caught adozen different cold and flu viruses, never having been exposed,but that's another whole argument.I still think it's a well-thought out, plausible scenario. And,it IS a comedy, so the science slips a little. But it sure couldhave been a lot more far fetched and silly.It's very well done, amazing attention to detail (especially in the small details of the house), excellent period, well thought out and written and FUNNY!!! Just small things, like how 1998 LA could look like a nuclear holocaust to an uninformed onlooker...priceless.",

Brenden Frasier saves the show though, his performance is hilarious, he's a very talented guy. Overall this was a disappointing waste of $8 dollars I could've used to see 'Gods And Monsters'.",

Alicia Silverstone was very convincing as Eve, who was a modern, normal, woman of the 90s. But my favorite character was Troy.  I love Dave Foley!  Most of my favorite lines come from his character.  He was also very believable as a gay man.My only real problem about the whole premise was that fact that Eve and Troy wasn't all that curious about Adam.  The only mention that they wonder about him is Troy's comment that he might be from the \"X-Files\".",

            "content": "Vaguely enjoyable pap that is saved from the utter predictability of its plot and the sickeningly sweet ending by great performances from the ever-reliable Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek. The film does in fact start promisingly as a kind of skit or satire on cold war paranoia in America of the early 1960s. The period design of the sets and the costumes capture the age well and Walken and Spacek are outstanding However as the story develops, the romantic comedy between the two main characters (Adam and Eve!)begins to grate.Their relationship has none of the spark a romantic comedy needs and really one couldn't care less about the characters who are two dimensional. In a way it is perfect to watch with mum and dad and it does have some laugh out loud moments. However this film has little soul and is poorly scripted... I winced as Alicia Silverstone's gay best friend counselled Adam: 'You're a nice boy ... now it is time to be a nice man'. Undoubtedly well made, the clich\u00e9-ridden plot and at times dubious values (often straight out of the Eisenhower manual for nuclear families) had me cringing and shouting at the screen",

He uses 'Ipana' toothpaste. He has $50k worth of mint condition 1940-50s baseball cards. He speaks fluent French and German.There are so many delightful, beautiful wow-moments in this movie that I suggest that reviewers who complain that it's 'not consistently funny' try The Three Stooges or Benny Hill.This is a marvelous movie. Sissy Spacek and Christopher Walken are priceless as perfectly preserved 1950s suburbanites. I've watched it several times over the years, and will again. Highly Recommended.",

He has only had human interaction with his parents for 35 years. He learns to dance with his Mom in a basement so of course he walks into a 90s Swing nightclub and starts throwing and twirling 2 babes in the air at once. Oh, and the 'clever' line that gets her attention is \"have you seen my Congressional Medal of Honor, I think I dropped it in here?\"My God, don't these filmmakers know that they shoot people for saying things that lame to women in LA!!!The ONLY thing that was cool was the props and set design.

The only really captivating scene in the movie involves Fraser dancing at a club like he's been trained by a pro.  (He says he's taken a dancing lesson every day of his life.  He has, from his mother.  Where did SHE learn to dance like that?)Don't waste your time with this one unless you just think Fraser and Silverstone are too good-looking to miss.
