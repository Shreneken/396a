Even adults who are not parents will love it!There's humor, there's action, there's nostalgia, there's the perfect capture of being a child, there are positive messages (be yourself, don't kill, etc.), there's satire, there are adults who are not stupid and not comic relief....there's GREAT WRITING!AND NO SONG AND DANCE NUMBERS! Also, there are NO COMIC-RELIEF ANIMAL SIDEKICKS! Take that, Disney! I know some people might be resisting this movie, because it looks like it's aimed for kids - and they might be expecting a Disney clone (and we all know the bad results of Disney wannabes).....but TRUST ME. Give this movie a chance - you'll love it!Is there ANYTHING wrong with it? Well, the only thing that bugged me (just a little) were some close-ups of the characters - these certain close-ups had a \"sketchy\" look a la the movies \"We're Back!\" and \"Balto\".Fortunately, there's very little of this. Other than that - this is a PERFECT MOVIE!",

            "content": "The Iron Giant was a beautiful, funny and touching movie, that is one of the best non-Disney animated movies I have seen along with The Prince of Egypt, The Secret of NIMH, Watership Down and Castle of Cagliostro. There wasn't a single thing I hated about the movie, for me it was outstanding on every level. The animation was absolutely gorgeous, with stunning colourful backgrounds and brilliant character animation especially on the Iron Giant himself. The music by Michael Kamen was consistently excellent, and never overpowered the story. In fact at times it even enhanced the drama. And the film has a beautiful message not to mention a sweet story. The characters were delightful, Hogarth isn't annoying at all and the Iron Giant isn't scary in the slightest. Strictly speaking he has to be one of the most gentle and poignant characters in an animated film. There are plenty of effective scenes like the explosive climax and the scene with the dead deer is a real tear jerker. I will admit I was worried initially when I saw the voice cast, but everybody involved did a superb job. Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jnr were perfect, in their most understated performances. Both get stick about being untalented, but for me their vocal contributions in this film suggests otherwise, while Christopher MacDonald almost steals the film as the FBI agent. Eli Marienthal is very sweet and likable as Hogarth too, and watch out for John Mahoney and Cloris Leachman. All in all, an outstanding film, that if you mind me saying so is the best animated film of 1999 and one of the best films of that year too. I may be wrong but I do think it is highly underrated on IMDb. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "I'm 25 years old.  I have no children.  So why am I praising a 'kid's movie' which nobody saw?  Because I have never seen a film pack the emotional wallop 'The Iron Giant' provided.The film's plot is similar to 'E.T.' - a young boy meets an alien robot from outer space, who is stranded on earth, and runs afoul of paranoid government agents.  Not to knock the Spielberg film, but what makes 'The Iron Giant' the better film is that the young boy is the teacher.  It is he who has to teach the Giant about the beauty of life, the difference between good and evil, and choices we have to make.  The Iron Giant, it turns out, is a weapon, who has to struggle against his own nature.  The film has an obvious (and timely) gun control message, but its real message is about the choice we make when dealing with other people.  We can use our powers for good or lash out at everyone around us.I dare not give away the climax.  All I will say is that it features a sacrifice absolutely breaktaking and emotionally shattering (albeit somewhat blunted by the ending).  The animation is gorgeous, Michael Kamen's score is perfect, and the film beautifully evokes the 1950s.Sadly, poor marketing kept audiences away in droves.  All I can say is, to heck with the box office gross.  Despite Warner's appearant desire to pretend the film never existed, the word is getting around about what a magical film this is, and I have no doubt it will join 'It's a Wonderful Life' as a film which bombed in theatres but became a classic over the years.  See it now, so you can say you discovered it before everyone else did.",

            "review_title": "An Absolute Wonder Which Cherishes Its Influences - The Best Animated Feature Ever !",
            "content": "Animated movies have long been considered strictly for children.  The old Disney classics that started it all are indeed aimed at kids, but are still very watchable, even for adults.  With the advent of TOY STORY and its countless mimics,  animated feature films have taken long strides to be considered worthy of serious attention.  THE IRON GIANT is just such an animated piece.  The 87 minute wonder is, to put it mildly, incredible. Everything about it is good.  I've also never seen so many influences and references in an animated film before.This is a movie with a heart the size of the title character.  A gentle, gigantic robot is rocketed to earth and befriends a 10 year old boy.  The kid has a single mother (voiced nicely by Jennifer Aniston) and he is just looking for a friend, whether it be a squirrel, or even a 50 foot tall machine.  The familiar premise is obviously out of Spielberg's E.T.  One scene even has the giant reaching out his finger to the boy in much the same way ET did to 10 year old Elliott when he departed this earth.  E.T. was an out of this world fantasy that took place on this earth.  Here, it is animated and almost just as effective.IRON GIANT takes place during 1957 in a small town in Maine.  The 1950's was a time when the American public was fearful of atomic bombs and the possibility of alien life off the earth.  Live-action sci-fi films of the 1950's always depicted the arrival of \"dangerous\" alien life and our efforts to destroy it.  THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is an influence on this film for evident reasons.  Ultimately, the characters in that classic learn from the extra-terrestrial being and realize the dangers of the A-Bomb.  It is amazing to see an animated feature which can relay this same type of message some 50 years later.A beautiful and touching ode to BAMBI is witnessed about halfway through. It also brings back some tearful moments from the key scene in that great, hand-drawn film.  Here, we see both hand-drawn imagery coupled with a computer-generated \"iron giant\".  The title character is actually a 3D composition done digitally, mixed with the 2D action surrounding him.  There are some highly imaginative shots of the robot mixing in with the film's environment.  At one point, he appears to be a lighthouse until the lights begin to blink.  I guess robots must blink too.  Enough analysis.  I loved this movie.  It is ranked #81 on the top list by other user authors for a reason.  Not only is it escapist, fantastic entertainment for kids, adults, and seniors alike, it is an animated picture like no other.  It combines the joy of SNOW WHITE and PINOCCHIO, the commentary of 1950's science fiction, and the wizardry and laughter of TOY STORY and its sequel.  Do not miss this enchanting flick.RATING: ****",

            "content": "\"The Iron Giant\" is the kind of animated film you wish there was more of. It respects the audience's intelligence, it has genuine emotion without resorting to schmaltz, and best of all it balances fantasy (well, science fiction) with believability.  I think Warner Brothers animation has out-Disneyed Disney by adding thoughtful writing to clean, understated animation.  What a concept!The story is deceptively simple: Iron Giant falls from the sky at the dawn of the Space Race and befriends a young boy.  But within that framework we get a double story, one for the grown ups and one for the kids, but the message is essentially the same one: paranoia and violence begets violence. I appreciate very much, as others who have commented, that no one burst into incongruous song and that there were no cutesy animal sidekicks.  I should add that there were no clever yet implausible plot twists, nor were there any stock characters.  The bad guy gets a little overheated, true, but he is never the embodiment of all things evil.  The townspeople are your average small town Americans, not bumpkins.  Mom is, well, mom-ish, caring but neither shrewish nor prone to whimpering outbursts.  And our hero is plucky but not annoyingly precocious.A BIG plus for this film is how well it weds the computer animation to the hand-drawn animation, a feat that the Big Mouse hasn't mastered yet.  Even as recently as \"Tarzan\" it is glaringly apparent what parts are computer graphics and which aren't, and the contrast is very distracting. \"The Iron Giant\" makes a virtue of streamlined animation that draws your eye to the beauty of its color and motion.It was a very VERY distinct and unusual pleasure to be treated to a film such as this.  Give us more . . . please!",

            "content": "All too often, \"family films\" are only infantile, simplistic formulas with a few self-referential and pop-culture jokes thrown in to try and keep adults awake.  But then along comes  something like \"The Iron Giant\", which is sophisticated enough to demand respect while maintaining a mythic and pure-hearted tone that actually does appeal to the kid in everybody.\"The Iron Giant\" is refreshingly non-Disney in no end of ways.  Characters seem real and chosen to fit the story, instead of being a superficial reshuffling of an old formula.  The animation definitely has its eye-popping moments, but there are also scenes of great wonderment, pathos, and humour that only top-drawer animation can convey.  The Giant itself is a great character, who only becomes MORE interesting as the film continues (another huge break from Disney).  No scene is wasted in this film, either; every set piece, even the really funny ones, helps either to establish the \"world\" of the movie, or to advance the plot.  At no time do you feel that you are merely waiting for the story to crank up again.\"The Iron Giant\" is funny, exhilarating, and touching as well.  It's sad to see it failing at the box office, as a blunt reminder that the success of films is often in direct proportion to their publicity budget.  Hopefully, though, word-of-mouth will come to its rescue.  Go see it!  Tell your friends!  Then go again!  (Repeat as necessary.)P.S.  I find myself comparing the Iron Giant character to Martin Donovan's character in \"Amateur\".  If there is anyone else on earth who has seen both films you may wish to entertain the notion yourself.",

The original story, which the late Poet Laureate had set in England, saw the innocent Titan of the title emerge from the sea; here he is a visitor from another galaxy.The Iron Giant is an amazing piece of animation, the voice-overs were done perfectly, the actors obviously enjoyed themselves, the animated art direction and cinematography was beautiful and the giant itself is just...breathtaking.The Iron Giant is not just another silly little kiddies movie, it is perfection in filmmaking.

            "content": "An ambitious take on Ted Hughes' 1968 children's book The Iron Man, director Brad Bird's The Iron Giant works well as both archetype-infused allegory and heartstring-tugging tale of friendship.  Set in small town Maine in the 1950s at the height of Cold War paranoia, the film explores the relationship between a lonely, fatherless boy (a photo on a nightstand hints that the father was a combat pilot killed in WWII) and a monstrously huge, hulking metal behemoth (the origins of which are brilliantly left to the imagination).  The animation marks a welcome contrast from the virtually ubiquitous Disney template, with the human characters bearing a stylized, comic book exaggeration that fits perfectly with the story material.  The Iron Giant has more than enough imagination and sparkle to interest kids and adults, and nicely balances its action-adventure aspirations with a solidly-crafted sense of moral purpose.",

            "content": "After seeing this movie, I was overcome by a strange feeling. I realized that I had found a treasure where I had least expected it. The Iron Giant is intelligent, funny, touching, and visually superb, and should show the world that an animated movie does not need to be A) computer-animated, or B) based on a fairy tale to be successful. One of the best American-made children's movies I have seen in a decade: 8.5/10.0Now, I'm a 17-year-old who is slowly transitioning into the domain of movie buffdom, which basically means that I am watching a stream of movies based on recommendations from friends, critics, and the IMDb Top 250 list. I got this one almost by accident after the local rental place could not find the movie I was really after, choosing it basically on the knowledge that it was the previous project of Brad Bird, director of The Incredibles (a personal favorite). After watching it, I felt like calling up every mother I knew and telling her to have her children (and herself) watch this.The Iron Giant revolves around an adventurous young boy in 1950s small-town America who discovers a gigantic robot out in the woods that has arrived on Earth from goodness-knows-where. He befriends the robot, while trying to keep him safe from a nosy government agent. The story seldom lags, with a series of comical adventures connected by the boy's growing relationship with his friend. This movie is very appealing as entertainment. The voices are well-done, and the scenery is also terrific. Most importantly, though, is the animation, which is a bright spot from this time period. The characters are well-drawn, especially the Giant, who through terrific design, lifelike movements, and clever small touches (i.e., the eyes) seems both alien and human, imposing and childlike. Furthermore, the animation is comical. I don't know when I have ever seen slapstick or punchlines so well-complimented by the animation. The script, written by Bird and based off the book The Iron Man, is also very well done. Though the movie relies upon a few minor crutches common to children's movies, it is still very original and clever.One thing that I must point out about this movie is its morals. Throughout the movie, the main moral of the story, about the Iron Giant learning and choosing to be good, is actually fairly adroitly handled. At no point when the subject comes up, including standard sentimental climax, does the idea seem contrived. Throughout the movie, evidence of Bird's influence by comic books is quite evident, and his ultimate message about heroes (variations of which will resurface in The Incredibles) is relevant and sincere. However, I do have to say that the secondary moral, about the evils of xenophobia and paranoia, both of which are embodied by the movie's antagonist, the government agent and the military, are very politically charged. While this may sound initially controversial and politically charged for a kids' movie (the second of which I do not deny), I noticed that it was in large part a thoughtful spoof of Cold War America, with jokes as well as valuable lessons about \"duck and cover\" and 1950s nuclear edginess that I found very clever.On a final note, I do have to point out that this movie had me laughing hard, but more importantly, it brought me closer to tears than any animated movie I can remember (including Bambi), closer than I like to admit. I wish that I had discovered it sooner, and I hope that everyone gets the chance to experience it the way I did.",

As I watched \"The Iron Giant\" I realized I had forgotten it was an animated feature. Don't get me wrong. I knew the enormous title character was animated, but the relationships among the characters and the intelligence of the script caused me to forget that these weren't actors. The movie is filled with tender moments, especially as they relate to our feelings of our own mortality. What I enjoyed is that the grownups aren't treated as garden variety bad guys. Even the military, which is nearly always portrayed as evil, finds itself in a contradictory position--having to go on faith. The animation is wonderful, but so are the \"performances.\" No spoilers here, but I think the ending is a lovely tribute to the spirit of the life force in all of us--even those of us not made of metal.

The writing is great the animation is excellent and the voice acting is superb.  I don't think I've liked an English animated film this much since The Plague Dogs.  The film doesn't talk down to it's audience, and instead tells a simple story very well.  My only complaint would be that Hogarth is somewhat of a smart-alec at times, but I guess this is the era of Leave it To Beaver.Many of the situations are standard movie-fare, the ex-lax in the food, the helmet on the bed, but it's nice to see them in an animated film for a change.  As an anime fan, the realism of the movie didn't impress me as much as the quality of the writing, voice acting, and the music and sound effects.  I particularly remember the sound of the power lines snapping and the musical score building up to the climax of the film.The character design for the giant is excellent, it's amazing how they could draw out very subtle emotions without noticeably distorting the face.  I bawled like a baby near the end.Finally, most importantly for me, there are NO CHEAP LAUGHS in the movie. One of the best moments in the movie for me was when Hogarth is running through the woods and he slams his face into a low branch.  The theater full of kids raised on recent Disney crap bursts into laughter, but wait, there's no stupid sound effect, he's not hopping back up to his feet instantly with a ridiculous lump or distorted face or little birds flying around his head, he's still on the ground ... and what's that coming out of his nose.. it CAN'T BE.. it IS, a trickle of BLOOD.  The kids (and parents) quickly cease their laughter.  I couldn't stop smiling because I knew then that like me, they actually cared about the character on the screen and frankly that doesn't happen very often.Tarzan was a small step in the right direction, and near the end of the long path beginning with that step is The Iron Giant.",

Apparently, this bombed during its initial release, as it was caught between the old ways of animated films and the new breath of fresh air in Pixar. Brad Bird will become well known for the latter's stellar films, but his directorial debut may be his crowning achievement.Set during the height of the Cold War in the '50s, the story follows a young boy named Hogarth, who lives with his single mother in a small town in Maine. He's obsessed with science fiction movies and comic books and finds a paternal relationship and friendship with an otherworldly giant robot. The film balances its obvious E.T. inspired storyline with its Superman-esque inspiration as well. It's seeped with 50's iconography and mood too, giving the audience a lot of insight into the Cold War and the red scare that was so prevalent at the time the movie was taking place. Its period piece offers much more subtext than a traditionally animated film.Every character is charming and well rounded, whether it be Hogarth himself, Annie, Kent Mansley, Dean, or the Iron Giant himself. All the voice actors do extremely well too, especially Vin Diesel in the titular role, whose soft-spoken giant's relationship with Hogarth is the emotional backbone for the film. The animation and art style is beautiful, and adds to the depth of each character with exaggerated facial expressions, and offers a lot more focus on the emotions of the characters. The computer animation of the iron giant gives it an otherworldly perspective.The Iron Giant is one of the best-animated films of all time, and a classic that can be enjoyed by anyone. It's an emotionally warm film full of vibrant animation, great characters, and a story that offers much heart and joy.",

So rather than focus on managing evolution of drama, `Iron' focuses on evocation of a single `feel.' And they do that well enough for me. I actually did participate in those duck and cover drills.What I find more interesting is the approach they took to the production of the film, which I find highly self-referential, and which may be the cause of a subtle effect for the viewer. At least I like to think so.The giant is drawn not by a human animator -- instead it is a three-dimensional model created in the computer. The computer then `renders' the 2-D image according to directions. The resulting figure is assembled in a scene that has hand-drawn human characters. In a very real sense, this character of a robot is acted by a robot, while the human characters are `acted' (drawn) by humans.As with all cartoony films, the voices are what you really `see' so far as the drama. But in terms of the images -- which is what all film experiences are about -- what you really see is a conflict among the religions of animators very much like what you see on the screen. That it is set in a pre-computer, but post-nuclear age -- that the lines drawn are not ones of coexistence but of good and evil -- says a lot about Bird's take on all this. A very intimate and effective film on filmmaking. Probably shouldn't be on IMDB's `science fiction' list though.",

            "content": "Hmmm, what to say...well....  it was really good.  I've seen it several times, and I've enjoyed it immensely each time for different reasons.\nAnalytically I find the animation incredible.  The characters are extremely alive and quite realistic, not because of incredible drawing, well, actually, yes: the way the characters are drawn, and animated, is incredible.  From the jerking, swaying and swooshing of body parts to the magnificent and CONSISTENT use of eyes, eyebrows and cheekbones to show real emotions, it's definite that this movie is a masterpiece in terms of animation.  The backgrounds are wonderfully lush, and evoke a wonderful sense of everything that shows fall for the beautiful season it is.  I love animation, and I love good looking landscapes, so the artists behind this movie are making a fan out of me very quickly.I admire (analytically) most of all the enormous apparance of little details in the film: the season sublty changes from fall to winter; the characters are always doing something, even if they aren't directly in focus (the best ad-libbing a director could dream of); I also think in some parts of the movie the little details actually become crucial to the movie's strength and validity (the time and setting of the story help it to make more sense, also, the \"duck and cover\" scene)You know, I think it's amazing when sometimes a movie can move you so much, talking about it's good qualities seems like child's play.  This is the kind of movie that you can watch over and over and take a long time to get sick of. We all have movies like that, very few can do that to us, but we have them. I'm realising as I write that I like this movie very much, because I've written two or three paragraphs and have not even started talking about the iron giant yet.The animation and expression of emotion in the giant, who is a computer graphics animated character, a hundred feet tall and with a certain old time sci fi persona to him, equals and even surpasses it's traditionally animated companions.  There were scenes in the movie that the giant almost made me cry because of his expressions.  The director, Brad Bird I think, should earn good credit for his work bringing the giant to life.  The giant was very organic and fluid, always animated and extremely alive, without really trying to be. After a while it obvious he's not your average rigid robot.It's hard not to give away details when you write a lot, but thankfully I haven't really given anything away.  I will say this...the movie is about not prejudging things you are unfamiliar with, big or small, and it's about doing what is right and not using gray areas and politics as an excuse not to do the right thing. The movie explores the strange concept of finding friendship, love, and innocence inbetween past guilts and prejudices. It is one of the most well rounded, enriching, thought provoking movies I have seen in my lifetime, and the best part is that it wasn't the visual effects that made me say that...something other feature animation companies have used a a string to lead me on for almost a decade.  I feel like I just recovered from an extended brainwashing experiment.  I've learned my lesson. No longer will movies that use stunning graphics to redeem themselves be an interest to me.  Rather I will watch movies for the messages they give and the depth those movies have. If anything Brad Bird must have tried to make the giant as close in simplicity to the regular animated characters as possible, because you CANNOT tell the difference between CG and traditional in this movie.  Exceptional stuff.I can't imagine anyone I know not liking this movie.  I've shown it to a LOT of people, college students mostly, of all races and religions, with different prides and prejudices, the result, amazingly, always seems to be the same: I have some after movie comments here, and I quote:\"Wow!\" ; \"That was NICE!\"; \"That was SO...GOOD!\" ;\"That giant is crucial, dog!\" ;\"It was good...yeah...I liked it!\",; and \"Dang man, that joint TIGHT!\".  If you actually read this review all the way, that's nice. Now forget everything I bumbled about and go see this movie, that way you can spent less time writing your own review than you did reading mine.",

            "content": "Having to compete with Disney, Dreamworks and Pixar, Warner Brother's animation has never been at the forefront of the animation industry. Apparently all they needed was the brilliant Brad Bird to quell any doubt about their capabilities. The Iron Giant is one of the final films to be presented in the traditional animation form, but even this flick had begun the transition to computer generated visuals. A number of characters, including the giant, were inserted digitally over the hand drawn background, taking special care to perform this imperfectly so as to contrast the rougher backdrop. The finished piece is a visually flawless and captivating film and ranks among the best animated features to ever grace the screen.Brad Bird who began with significant role in The Simpson's cartoon, marks his feature film debut, and would follow up with the even superior films The Incredibles and Ratatouille. The Iron Giant is part political statement, part satire and part family fare, but contains more substance then most children's films, containing passionate and is reminiscent of classics such as ET and The Lion King. Based on the book by Ted Hughes, the tale tells of a young boy in Rockwell, Maine named Hogarth Hughes voiced by unknown Eli Marienthal who, if you must put a face to the voice played Stiffler's younger brother in American Pie, in Cold War era 1958. His mother voiced by Jennifer Aniston, works late shifts at a local diner, his father has been killed (presumably in combat, as we see from a photograph he was a fighter pilot) and Hogarth who has been moved up a grade, finds himself lonely and misunderstood.On a stormy night, a mysterious object crashes off the coast, which to Hogarth's surprise (and everyone's for that matter) is a giant metal eating robot. Finding the creature to be as harmless and confused as a young boy, he befriends the behemoth, stashing him away in a local scrap yard, who the owner (voiced by Harry Connick Jr.) is not especially pleased about. After the giants shenanigans begin to be noticed, a federal agent, brilliantly voiced by Christopher McDonald, comes to investigate ands comes to suspect Hogarth may know something.The scenes where Hogarth attempts to hide the creature are the most hilarious, one sequence after the giant loses his hand (which can walk on its own once severed) our young protagonist attempts to sneak it out of the house. But don't be fooled, the iron Giant is less comedy then it is bold statement, but don't let this turn you off either.Bird's piece is riddled with political commentary on the Cold War and its effect on America and the society's obsession with warfare, weapons and at what cost freedom can be obtained, issues such as morality and death, and explores the human gift of free will, as both a blessing and as a means to do harm. The Giant, despite having every few lines is surprisingly layered and human, and has an innocence covering an inner evil turmoil. The message that you are who you chose to be is reminiscent throughout the whole film, but it never for a second feels preachy. The climax is a thrilling as any action picture, which I will say may be slightly too violent for younger children, and the closing act is as touching as any committed to celluloid.The Iron Giant is a dazzling tale and complex experience which is bound to keep you involved, entertained and will give you something to think about after leaving the theatre. Ranking as one of the best films of 1999, if The Iron Giant marks the end of the reign of the traditional animation style, I say that no finer adieu could be given in this world, or any, dare I say it, beyond this Earth.Read all my reviews at: http://www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",

            "content": "I'm going to say one thing. When I first saw this back in 2016, it did seem interesting to me. I thought it would be just an enjoyable sci fi film. But honestly, I did not expect this to be one of my favorite animated movies. The Iron Giant may possibly be the best animated movie Warner Bros has produced worldwide. At first, it seemed it was just gonna have a little cheesy giant monster film. But this is more than that. The story was incredibly written that's about a giant robot that is taught to be a civilized monster. It has profited a lot of character development. And this has presented top notch animation with some of the best effects for an animated film. It's not enough to make a reason how I consider this a masterpiece. It's how heartfelt it is. If you have actually seen monster movies, the setting is in the 50s. And you'll see they normally either take over cities or destroy the world. But this is a lot different. This is about how the giant learns about the world, what happens in life and why everyone would be afraid of him. I'm not gonna spoil it, but let's say that the ending has been a true example. No matter what, you got to watch this film. The one thing that shocked me is it wasn't much successful at the box office. And now many people has given so much attention many years later. Not only is this one of the most underrated movies I've seen, but also one of the most feel good movies I've seen. As the giant himself said it best, souls never die.",

Intelligent, funny, tragic, and deeply moving, we'd be so lucky to ever see an American animated film strike such chords again. The look of the film is superb, and it's underlying themes and messages resonate even more strongly today. Containing a boldly pacifist theme, the film tells a story of a mechanism of war--meant to destroy--that, through the innocence of a little boy, learns to sacrifice in the name of peace and understanding, as apposed to killing in the name of ownership and power. I hope,as years pass, more and more people come to discover this gem so that they can share their experience with the Iron Giant, as well.",

I knew a couple of kids my age whose dads had never come home from a place called Korea.There are some glitches -- a 1959 Cadillac in a scrapyard in 1957, for instance, or going skinny-dipping in a lake in Maine in late October; and i'm fairly sure that (a) There was no \"Spirit\" comic in publication in 1957 and that (b) the \"Spirit\" comic cover shown is actually a painting \"Spirit\" creator Will Eisner did in the late 70s/early 80s for a reprint series.The references to films of the period -- the sand pit from \"Invaders from Mars\", the tank disintegration for \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" and the animated \"Brain from Planet Arous\" on teevee are neat, too.Looking forward to next Friday's opening of Brad Bird's new film, \"The Incredibles\", though i suspect that \"Iron Giant\" will prove to be the stronger of the two...",

            "content": "Like most reviewers here, I stumbled across The Iron Giant. Frankly, I don't know how I missed it in the theatres, but I picked up a used VHS copy a few years back and fell for it. I recently purchased the DVD version and have rekindled my appreciation for this lovely film.In addition to being a polished gem of a morality play, it is well animated, and well voice-acted. Perhaps Hogarth is portrayed as too obvious a scamp and Kent is too over-the-top in his zeal but the subtlety in the Iron Giant's limited movements and \"vocabulary\" more than make up for it. In any case, this is an animated film - we should expect \"cartoonish\" characters, right? Perhaps it was the total lack of cutesy animals doing Disneyesque song-and-dance numbers, but I found myself noticing the \"acting\" of these characters. Don't worry, I snapped out of it soon enough...Unlike some, I didn't see TIG as a slam against militarism. In fact, the General here (nicely voiced by John Mahoney) shows a considerable amount of balance. Rather, the film is about personal growth and change, respect for life, values, and the bond of friendship. This side of the film works so well that the Giant's utterance of one word - \"Superman\" - toward the end of the film sent me searching for the tissues. (word of advice: keep them handy).Do yourself and your kids and watch this film. Appropriate (IMO) for ages 3 and over (including adults!).",

            "content": "Neither of these questions is answered in this charming movie, based on a novel by Ted Hughes, but it doesn't seem to matter. The Iron Giant is highly emotional film, but in an understated way. The scenes of 1950s small town Maine were highly evocative without being overly nostalgic. Hogarth is a great role model for young boys, even if he can be a bit impulsive and doesn't always listen to authority figures: he cares deeply for animals, and in this case, his robot friend, whom he looks after and instructs as if a young child. Not having experienced that era myself, the depiction of the Iron Giant nonetheless reminded of postwar Science Fiction covers, as in Tales to Astonish, etc., even if his gentle character did not. And I liked the anti-gun theme: Hogarth's toy gun \"triggers\" the self-defense mechanism in the robot, who gradually learns of his strength and automated programming, and, with the help of Hogarth, fights it: \"I am not a gun.\" I also appreciated the ambiguity of the robot: is it aliens? Russians? Does it matter?Watched in February 2021, all three of us really enjoyed it. Sienna: \"one of the best we've seen in a long time.\"",

Set during the period of time when Cold War and sci-fi paranoia was prevalent, The Iron Giant embraces these themes and stokes them with lessons of friendship, hatred, death and pertinent reminders of pacifism. Directed by Brad Bird and scripted by Tim McCanilies and Andy Brent Forrester, The Iron Giant is one of those rare animation animals that delights the kids as much as it does the watching adults. Though the actual giant himself, with all his dazzling weaponry, is the star attraction on show, it's the iron colossus' inner conflict that gives the film its heart. Aided by his friend, young Hogarth, good old iron decides he doesn't want to be a big weapon, but the authorities, as is nearly always the way, just can't let it be. The unflinching attitude that ran through many of the 50s sci-fi schlockers was one of being \"because we don't understand it, lets destroy it\" is something that Ted Hughes and the film makers here capture perfectly. Sophisticated and intelligent in its approach and delivery, this is definitely one of the better animated film's from the modern age. 9/10Voice work comes from Jennifer Anniston, Harry Connick Jr, Vin Diesel, James Gammon, Christopher McDonald, M. Emmet Walsh and Eli Marienthal.",

After saving the giants life, the two bond and Hogarth has to figure out how to keep the whole thing a secret, as a nosy government agent arrives in town convinced there's an enemy 'something' created either by the Russians or martians that must be destroyed.This is the perfect animated film, the giant looks great and has a neat personality and a cool sounding voice (like synthesized grinding metal). There's also enough humour to keep things a little on the lighter side.  But the movie shines spectacularly in its portrayl of a 'friendly giant' and a kid who tries to convince the world that he's harmless.  This is a total setup for a very sappy, preachy, and didactic story line, but the film is not like that at all.

It is designed around a lonely boy who unfortunately causes trouble with every pet he owns and his mother comes down hard on him when he tries to express his repressed feelings.Hogarth is a cheeky character that generates plenty good comedy in this picture. His imaginative nature makes you wish you were young whilst his enthusiasm at tackling exciting new opportunities, such as jumping in a freezing lake and going on his own adventures brings that accurate youthful mind that is scripted so exquisitely you will be flashing back to your own childhood.Like all Disney pictures, this Bird film has a strong message to portray to the younger generations. Lion King was the circle of life; Monsters Inc was child security whilst Robin Hood looked at the rich and the poor. Iron Giant has perhaps one of the strongest natured meanings at looking at life and death since Bambi. When The Giant is targeted he is triggered with a defence mechanism whilst Hogarth preaches to him about violence. It is powerful stuff that is all relative to the development of the young mind as this script looks to develop itself by looking at how to use violence and the context in which it is appropriate and when it is not. It is quite strong stuff, even for perhaps an older audience. When the Giant encounters the deer and the aftermath is very shocking. This by all means portrays the hard aspects of real life, blended with a sharp intake of science fiction.The means by which The Giant communicates and discovers the world's systems shows the contrasts with our world and the outer realms. The scope of technology the Giant brings is vastly different and we see a shocking look at other worldly technology versus the U.S Governments.The picture has its drawbacks. The humour is by no means on par with Pixar being awkwardly crude and in bad context.But significantly the rightful message is portrayed and it is a wonderfully made picture",

And I'm saying that because for unknown reasons, \"The Iron Giant\" was in my greylist.

I was also amazed at how great the animation itself looked because when it was made, 2D animation wasn't the big thing anymore, but it was the perfect fit for this film. The 2D animation gave it an old-time feel which greatly helped in making the audience feel like they were truly watching a film from the 50s. I also think that the 2D and CG animation was combined seamlessly and done well.I have to quickly give a shout out to the voice acting done in this film, because these actors were amazing! Especially the kids voice in the movie had so much emotion, playfulness, and innocence, it moved me to tears!I never thought I'd ever cry over a robot after watching the Terminator, but this movie changed that. The iron giant had barely any lines, and yet the character felt so human and real! And I NEVER thought I'd cry from one word being said, let alone that word being Superman!Even though it took me a while to see this film, I'm so glad I finally did and think that everyone should see this at least once in their life!

I recommend this movie to everyone. It's not just for kids. The animation, editing and soundtrack is amazing. I am a huge fan of Disney movies, but I cannot think of a Disney movie that can touch the Iron Giant on any level. This movie can be enjoyed by kids, parents and non-parents alike. It's not just a great action movie with great writing it will also touch you on an emotional level as well. I have been waiting and watching for a sequel, but I don't think anyone involved in this production intended to do another (even though the ending leaves that wide open). This is the type of movie I wish Hollywood would do more of, instead of re-makes and movies based of TV shows.",

            "content": "I have seen many promos with this movie on television, and was curious to see it. Sadly, I didn't, so I guess you can say that I was lazy for not seeing it. No matter, I did see this on HBO and watch this many times as it aired as a 24 hour marathon on Cartoon Network when Warner Bros and Cartoon Network were promoting \"The Powerpuff Girls Movie\" with a music video during the end credits of \"The Iron Giant.\" The movie itself feels timeless, and I know this movie will continue to find an audience despite of its failure at the box office when it first came out in theaters. I am more than happy that this movie has a cult following, and there many fans that are embracing it. With that said, \"The Iron Giant\" its about a boy named Hogarth Hughes who lives with his mother Annie a waitress has discovered a giant metallic robot, who fell from space and befriends him. A beatnik artist Dean McCoppin looks out for the Giant at a junkyard, but federal agent Kent Mansley wants to find the Giant and destroy it. The movie is itself is like Steven Spielberg's \"E.T. the Extra Terrestrial,\" but it acts very much its own movie. I continue to love this movie as I watch it, and I see nothing wrong about it. The movie does look gorgeous in widescreen as it gives it a much epic feel to it in a CinemaScope format. As much as we love animated movies in CGI like Pixar or DreamWorks, but I do think its beautiful to see an animated movie to be all done traditionally by hand instead of having it all done by a computer. The animation is again beautiful with all the rich colors, and details that were all put into this movie. I do love how the movie looks as the movie takes place in 1957. The movie does have some funny moments, and I guess a bit edgy for an animated movie that features some curse words. The movie is made for kids, but its something that adults would enjoy. Hey, when I first saw this movie, I didn't expect to hear any curse words in an animated movie which I thought it was going to be a clean animated movie like what Disney did with their animated movies. I guess both Bird and Warner Bros. want it to take it up a notch. The movie is rated PG, and nothing to be worrying about. Or shocking for that matter. I do love the characters, and really love the way they're designed. Also, I thought it had great voice acting. Jennifer Aniston; Harry Connick, Jr.; Eli Marienthal and Christopher McDonald were all really good for their own roles. Vin Diesel, I thought, was perfectly cast for voicing the Iron Giant, and can't imagine any one voicing it aside from Diesel. Michael Kamen's score to the movie is very good, and nothing more that I can say about. I love its story and the direction that the filmmakers went, and I think its perfectly executed. This is Brad Bird's greatest achievement, and should be given a lot of credit for making this wonderful movie. I have heard that Bird and Warner Bros. are both working on bringing this movie for a limited release this year on September the 30th, and October the 4th for remastering it and presenting two new scenes for the movie. This new cut will be called \"The Iron Giant: Signature Edition.\" I am very excited about it, and would love to see this on the big screen like I never had before. I love \"The Iron Giant,\" and I am giving this movie a 10 out of 10.",

            "content": "Back in 1999, when \"The Iron Giant\" was first released, several friends of mine, aware of my love for 1950s sci-fi films, urged me to go see this movie. For some reason, I passed. A few years later, another friend's 4-year-old son told me what a great video this was, but I still declined to watch it. And even later, when my own nephew (then 6) told me what a hilarious scene he'd just witnessed in \"The Iron Giant\" (the one in which young Hogarth drinks espresso and starts talking a mile a minute)...well, even then, I still ignored the advice. Anyway, all the above folk will be happy to hear that I finally DID watch this animated sci-fi film last night, and found it absolutely charming. Featuring wonderful animation, nice touches of warmth and humor, and wry commentary on '50s paranoia and A-bomb lunacy, the film really does have appeal to young and old. Lovers of sci-fi and/or action films should especially enjoy the film's latter scenes, in which the lovable Giant gets ticked off and morphs into an unstoppable killing machine. My hat is certainly off to everyone involved in the making of this most entertaining film. And this \"special edition\" DVD, filled with more extras than you can imagine, certainly does live up to the advertising. Hmmm...maybe I SHOULD take my nephew's advice and finally rent out his favorite movie, \"Toy Story 2\"...",

            "content": "I finally took the time to see writer/director Brad Bird's first foray into feature length film with The Iron Giant. Hearing how great of a film it was and the success of his Pixar debut The Incredibles, I've been seeing the movie on my shelf for a while now, just waiting to finally be viewed. If you thought his last movie had heart, you need to see this one. While being based on a book, I'm not sure if it is the original source material or Bird's vision on screen, but the parallels to King Kong are unmistakable. This creature from another world instills fear into all but one person\u0097one person who can see beneath the harsh exterior into the wealth of feelings and compassion bottled up within. Sure the beauty in a story like King Kong is the sacrifice he makes in order to keep his love safe at the unfortunate price of being a monster in the eyes of everyone else, but here we have a kid's story where happy endings aren't just a commonality but a necessity. Bird handles the subject matter nicely at the end in order to give the audience the same emotional attachment to the creature despite the fact that the general population does end up seeing him for what he truly is. Ala Superman/Spider-Man/ etc, the monster mystic soon dissolves as they begin saving human lives.A big part of The Iron Giant's success is the gorgeous animation. This may be one of the last great 2D animated films before CGI took over the field. The cinematic touches are great, including a depth of field composed of blurred images to give the audience a focal point. You forgive that the blurring effect renders the object even flatter than the medium does originally because the effect works as it would in a live-action film. Also, the lighting effects are wonderful, especially the flashlight sequences. When our young protagonist looks out his window into the woods, and the light flare goes from bright blind spot to illuminating band of vision, it looks very realistic. The power of the light even dissipates as the flash goes farther out into the distance. As with The Incredibles, though, the true heart of the film is in the fully fleshed out characters. There is not an overabundance of cluttered supporting roles, but instead a few main roles, which are allowed to evolve and grow an attachment from the viewers. The emotion etched into the movement and facial ticks of the Giant are spectacular at getting language across, much as would have been done in a silent film. Eli Marienthal does a great job as young Hogarth Hughes, the only one who believes that his new friend is more than a weapon. Christopher McDonald adds some nice comic relief as our only villainous role, albeit not a bad guy in the common use of the term, and Jennifer Aniston allows Mrs. Hughes to be both motherly and understanding of her son's adventures. The vocal star ends up being Harry Connick Jr., who is fantastic as Hogarth's friend and confidant when it comes to the new discovery of the Giant. I think the best compliment that a film like this can have is the fact that the vocal talent was so good I didn't recognize any as the people they are in real life. No one tried to infuse their own shtick into the part, but instead played the roles to enhance the story being told.Along with all that, we are treated to subtle commentary on the state of the government, both with the \"duck and cover\" absurdity of atomic warfare and the references to gun control and war. These jabs are just that though, small moments that go along with the story, rather than take it over and hijack the film like what happened with Happy Feet this year. Weighty issues can be addressed in children films successfully, making the audience understand the problem yet not shoving it down their throats when the real issue at hand is the relationship between a child and his new otherworldly friend, giving him the confidence to stand up for himself and be a hero.So far Bird has really impressed me as an animation director. While the teaser for Pixar's new Ratatouille left me a bit indifferent, just the attachment of this autuer's name makes me that much more excited for the movie. Hopefully Bird can keep the track record intact and also, maybe prove that in order for these films to be successful, a good story is necessary. In an age where we get around ten animated films a year, there are many that are horrible cashcows to rip off unsuspecting parents into taking the children to a cartoon. Thankfully Brad Bird shows us that animated films can still hold up against live action ones for the pieces of art they should aspire to be.",

            "content": "Based on the poem 'The Iron Man' by Ted Hughes, Brad Bird's first feature length movie, The Iron Giant, tells the story of a huge alien robot who crashes to Earth, where he is befriended by a young boy named Hogarth, but also pursued by a paranoid US government agent.Hogarth proceeds to teach his newfound metal pal about the wonders of life, the tragedy of death, the difference between good and evil, the joys of dive-bombing into water, and the all important moral 'we are who we choose to be'. However, when the boy innocently aims his toy gun at the massive mechanoid, the robot's true purpose is revealed: he is a walking array of extraterrestrial fire-power programmed to respond to aggression. And with the army on its way to apprehend the giant, it looks like the proverbial is about to hit the fan.Will the robot destroy his enemy with a series of high powered energy blasts from his in-built armoury? Or will he choose to fight his basic programming and become a hero?Featuring breath-taking CGI-enhanced animation, flawless direction, and a script that brilliantly and intelligently mixes comedy, action and drama in equal doses, The Iron Giant is an unmissable treat for all ages.In true kids' movie tradition, the story has several important messages to tell and a couple of tear-jerker scenes, but it thankfully never resorts to the heavy-handed moralising and saccharine sweet schmaltz of many an animated feature. Instead, Bird delicately handles his themes of anti-violence, freedom of choice, life and death, and sacrifice for those you love. And he does this without once feeling the need for a song and dance number. Nice one, Brad!The film also succeeds in feeling very 'real', despite its fantastical premise. This is undoubtedly down to the well developed and likable characters (brilliantly voiced by a talented cast) and the incredible attention to detail in the animation, which not only includes loads of authentic 50s design, but also throws in some great references to the sci-fi movies and comics of the time.If the majority of animated features of the past few years have left you less than impressed, do yourself a favour and track down The Iron Giant. Charming, exciting, and ultimately uplifting, it's a film that'll leave you grinning from ear to ear.",

This one sits high on a pedestal with The Little Mermaid and Lilo & Stitch as one of my favorite animated features. I am going to skip spoiler warnings here because, well, if you haven't seen this by now, then shame on you.A lone man in a boat in the middle of a terrible storm with hulking waves thrashing him from side to side cries desperately into a radio for help. As he is starting to lose hope, he glances up and spots an illumination in the sky. Saints be praised! It's a lighthouse! A brief moment of rejoicing is quickly extinguished by terror when he realizes that this light is no safe haven, but they eyes of a towering metal man.Miraculously, the man makes it out of this little pickle alive and goes to the local diner where he tells everyone his tale. With guffaws of disbelief, his audience implies that what the man saw came from the bottom of a bottle, if you catch my meaning.At a nearby table, a wide-eyed Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal) is listening to the man's story. Also listening in is Dean McCoppin who is voiced by Harry Connick Jr. He peeks over the wall to vouch for the man, only to be laughed at as well.Single mom to Hogarth, Annie Hughes (Jennifer Aniston), is hard at work waiting tables. Hogarth and Dean meet and are fast friends. Dean is a cool cat and is always calm and collected. Hogarth has a wild imagination and while he would love to do what his mother asks of him, he manages to do the opposite quite often.Hogarth is home alone that night while mom works late. The curious young man ventures out into the night to investigate suspicious activity and is awestruck to find the same humongous metal man from earlier. Incredibly, Hogarth saves the iron giant from doom.The following day, Hogarth bikes off to the woods in an attempt to find this new friend. He places a piece of sheet metal, the giant's favorite snack, out as bait. After dozing off, he is awoken by a loud noise. The metal is gone. He turns around to see that he has done what he came to do. Afraid at first, Hogarth runs, but quickly realizes that the iron giant means him no harm.Hogarth must teach his metal friend, voiced by Vin Diesel that guns are bad and that he doesn't have to be one, even though he is equipped with some major fire arms. Without a place to hide him and no food for him to eat, Hogarth takes the iron giant over to Dean's pad. Dean is an artist who deals mostly with large metal sculptures. \"I mean, what am I? A junkman who makes art or an artist who sells junk? You tell me.\" So you see, he has lots of metal sitting around. Perfect for snacking.Meanwhile, after reports of spotting the giant, a call is made and fast-talking government agent Kent Mansley (Christopher McDonald) rushes right over to get to the bottom of things. With his initial disbelief, Kent spends his time making quips about the small town. Gems like \"The biggest thing in this town is probably the homecoming queen.\" After a close encounter with a car that appears to be bitten in half, Kent catches on to the situation. He knows that Hogarth is hiding the iron giant and won't stop until he is discovered and destroyed.The movie is full of funny and endearing moments. A couple personal favorites include the scene in which Hogarth, Dean, and the iron giant go swimming. When the giant robot does a cannonball into the lake, hilarity ensues. The heart-to-heart scene that Hogarth has with the iron giant about death is also heart-warming. \"Souls don't die.\" When eventually the iron giant is discovered by the government, despite Hogarth's best efforts to tell them that he is harmless, Kent insists that they blow him to smithereens anyway. Hogarth tries to get a handle on the situation, but Kent \u2014 in a fit of madness \u2014 presses the obligatory big red button and launches a bomb that will destroy the giant, the town, and everyone in it.When it seems that all hope is lost, the iron giant bids his buddy Hogarth a fond farewell, shoots off into the sky, and collides with the bomb, saving everyone from certain death.Flash-forward. Annie and Dean are admiring what she says is his best work yet. A sculpture of the iron giant. Hogarth is given the only piece of the giant that was recovered, and is delighted when it lights up and jumps out the window. He knows the iron giant can self-repair and waves goodbye, hoping he'll see the iron giant again someday.Sweet. Funny. Touching. I really can't say enough good about this movie. I double dog dare you to make it through this one with dry eyes.(Search mssilverscreen for more of my reviews)",

The movie has a plot similar to \"E.T.\", with a lonely boy befriending a being from outer space. In this case, the setting is 1957 Maine (so could this accidentally represent Stephen King's childhood?) and the being is a giant robot whose origin and purpose never get revealed. Sure enough, a government agent starts prying.I was surprised to learn that the executive producer is none other than Pete Townshend of The Who. The last person whom you'd expect to be involved in the production of a movie that pokes fun at 1950s movies about aliens (the movie also has a scene where the kids are in school watching one of those duck-and-cover movies). The whole issue of a possible nuclear war looms large in the background (and nowadays, it looks more possible than ever).When the movie got released, the ads made it look like something to avoid at all costs.

What was Warner Brothers thinking when they marketed this work of art so poorly? 2. After about 10 minutes, the animation just fell away and for the rest of the movie, these were real people (and a real robot!) engaged in, and engaging me, in a marvelous story. 3. Any student of animation should make sure this work is on their list. Brad Bird is a genius, a master storyteller. It is no coincidence that he supplied the heart and magic of the early Pixar works. 4. During the last 10 minutes or so, there were so many emotions at play amongst the characters. As others have noted, I too was in tears by the end of it all. This is a story worth watching repeatedly. 5. The attention to detail is amazing; listen to the background sounds, there isn't just quiet in the background, but sounds that would be appropriate to the surroundings. Similarly, I noticed a number of nods to past animators, particularly Jay Ward with his simple hand-drawn characters (which were necessary because he had almost no money to work with) - like Jay Ward, and for that matter the South Park creators, Rankin-Bass, Hanna-Barbera, and others I cannot think of at the moment, Brad Bird fully understands that it was the story that mattered, not so much the animation.",

            "content": "It's sad, that this animated movie was not a huge hit, when it came out in 1999, due to poor-marketing. Nevertheless, as time, with on, 'The Iron Giant' has grown widespread critical acclaim from both critics and audiences for its out of this world story about an friendship between, a 50-feet alien robot (Voiced by Vin Diesel) & a young boy, Hogarth Hughes (Voiced by Eli Mariethal) in a rural part of Maine; while, an over paranoid government agent, Kent Mansley (Voiced by Christopher McDonald) tries to hunt them, down, fearing that the giant could be dangerous. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while some of the plot-points does sound a little too familiar, as if it's ripping off, 1982's 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' in the first half. I have to say, the story in the second half, is still unique enough to stand out on its own. The movie has a lot of strong themes that films like 'E.T' doesn't deal with, such as an anti-nuclear war message. I like how the Giant has to deal with his inner conflict as a doomsday weapon; similar to how humans have to deal with the destructiveness nature of themselves, during the Cold War. Somber scenes like when, Iron Giant & Hogarth greets the deer, really does show, the good of humanity, and how, losing our humanity, makes us, into cold-blooded machine, like the hunters, later in that moment. However, it's not, all gloom and doom, as there is also an equally satire funny side to the film's anti-war message, with Agent Mansley, acting upon violence, without thinking or getting to know, the other side. It gave us, some of the best moments like the mitt phone call to general, Shannon Rogard (Voiced by John Mahoney) or landside ice cream scenes. Also, the child-like, interaction, between Hogarth & the Iron Giant was equally as fun to watch. The diving scene, alone, makes this film, worth seeing. Regardless, of the tone of the film, the movie really does capture the era, full of panic, fear and anxiety as leading politicians and the media whipped the public into an escalating mass frenzy, over Nuclear War with the Soviets, in both satirical and serious ways. It's a film, both children and adults would love. Yet, there is some things, that people might not, like, about this film, such in the case that the story of the movie bears very little resemblance to author, Ted Hughes's novel, 'the Iron Man', in which, it loosely based on. Not only is the settling change from United Kingdom, to United States, but the film also, cut, most of the fantasy parts, such as the battle with the Space-Bat-Angel-Dragon. Another thing, that the film cut, was the fact that the giant robot was a harmony of the spheres whom keeps the cosmos in balance, by singing in the ocean. Because of this change from siren to alien robot, the original producer, guitarist Pete Townshend, from the rock band, 'The Who', instead, chose to release a rock opera adaptation, 'The Iron Man: A Musical', in 1989. Regardless, of the changes, the movie still has amazing soundtrack by composer, Michael Kamen. Great use of collection of Bernard Hermann cues from 50's and 60's sci-fi films. Not only that, but wonderful voice acting from everybody in this film, ranging with Jennifer Aniston as the mom, Annie to supporting voice actors like Harry Connick Jr. as dead-on, beatnik, Dean McCoppin. Another great thing, about this movie is the animation. I love how director/animator, Brad Bird and his crew, blend the CGI Giant with hand-drawn Norman Rockwell, mixed with 1950s illustration so well. Everything looks and feels the era. It really does mesh. Even the pacing for 'the Iron Giant' was, well-done. However, I don't think, the signature edition is the best version of the movie. The once delete scenes of Annie & Dean, talking in the diner, doesn't really add much, as we see them, interact, later in the film. Another thing, I don't like, about this version is the dream sequence. It really ruins, the mystique of the Giant, by revealing, too early that he is a doomsday weapon. I really don't like, how jarring, it is. I would, rather have the fight in the junkyard, instead. It's a little stronger, as it has weight, due to Giant, nearly killing the person, he love, due to his programming. It makes the climactic, tear-jerking ending, a little more powerful. Don't get me wrong, I still think the Signature Edition is a good version to have, if you're a mega fan, but if you haven't seen the movie, just watch the original theatrical cut of the movie. Overall: I like how this film is picking up in popularity, due to the film's director, going on to direct, other animation hits like Disney's 2004's 'The Incredibles' & 2007's 'Ratatouille'. While, it's still not a household name. I think, with each new generation. Both children and adults will come to love, this film for its creativity, comedy and heart. It's highly recommended. An animation classic & masterpiece.",

            "content": "1957. When a Maine fisherman reports a sighting of a giant metal device from outer space, nobody believes him except for Special Agent Kent Mansley \u0096 always one to hunt out any communist plot involving invasion from outer space. However the robot remains elusive to all but young Hogarth Hughes, who finds it in the woods and manages to befriend it \u0096 even teaching it basic English. But with the origin and purpose of the robot unknown, is Hogarth right to accept it as a friend or should he fear it? Regardless, Mansley intends to kill it before it kills 'us'.It has been so many years since I read the book as a child, that I was pretty much coming to this with no knowledge of story or what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised by an intelligent film that is wholly entertaining and will please kids and adults. Set in the later fifties, the plot uses the iron giant as an allegory for the unknown and thus presents adults with a well-written criticism of the 'shoot first, questions later' mentality. Being a kids' film it is hardly a debating stand point but it was still intelligently enough done to keep me interested. The main plot is also interesting, with issues of death, birth and purpose all having a bearing on the story and giving food for thought later if you let it. These elements work to make quite a touching film where the giant is taught like a child by Hogarth and it becomes a very warm and likable character.None of this takes away from the film's first function as a kids' movie and as such it produces enough humour, visual excitement and energy to keep the kids happy even if the reference to the Cold War will be almost totally over their heads. The film is moving as much as it is humorous, intelligent as much as it is entertaining and the end result is a very well rounded film. Of course it has problems in that it does go where you expect it to at points, and it does lose its nerve towards the end and ducks the dark but satisfying ending it should have had, but these are minor complaints because the rest of it all works well together to form a really enjoyable animation.In a way I found it quite refreshing to have a kids' cartoon that provided warmth and intelligence for the adult audience to share in; I love stuff like Toy Story etc but their adult stuff is a little knowing and cynical at times (albeit hilariously so!) whereas here I felt that I was being given the same story as the kids and not having separate levels for them and me.The voice cast is good on paper but only a handful of them really get much to do. Marienthal is not the usual sickly sweet kid and he does a good job to make his character come across as convincing. Connick jr is very funny and provides a lot of laughs to the film; likewise McDonald's paranoid agent pretty much steals every scene he is in. I was concerned by the fact that Diesel was the voice of the robot, how would I warm to a character played by a man who struggles to bring any charisma to his other roles I wondered? However the limited dialogue and depth of his voice works well and he did a good job (although I'm sure it amounted to no more than a day in a recording studio). Aniston has little to do and her voice is not that distinctive but minor roles for Mahoney and Walsh add a sense of class with their very well known voices.Overall this is a very enjoyable animation. The plot is intelligent, interesting, moving and humorous at different points and, although some of it go over the kids' heads, it tells the same story to both age groups well.It's all over a bit quick and kids weaned on Pixar may complain about the traditional animation used for the majority of the film but there are only a few minor quibbles about this film and it is definitely worth hunting down. An interesting and entertaining family film that will stick in your mind for what it does and the talking points it leaves.",

            "content": "I watch almost any kind of movie, and when it comes to animated features, they have to be truly heart-warming to capture the real spirit of a family film. There have been plenty throughout the years that deserve immediate and all time praise; Toy Story (1, 2 and 3), How to Train Your Dragon, Aladdin, Sleeping Beauty, Shrek, Wall-E, and Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas (underrated Dreamworks cartoon). But no cartoon deserves more praise and acknowledgment than Brad Bird's The Iron Giant.The Iron Giant is set in 1957 and stars Vin Diesel as The Iron Giant, an alien machine that crash-lands on Earth and is soon befriended by a little boy named Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal), who discovers that \"Giant\", as Hogarth calls him, eats metal for food. Not long after all this, a government agent (Christopher McDonald) arrives and begins to cause trouble, and soon chaos as he believes Giant to be a foreign weapon sent to destroy America. I have never seen anything like this movie before; constantly heart-warming, family-fun comedy moments (which are great), and an emotionally shattering climax that is truly memorable. If you really love to watch movie and, not only be entertained, but moved, then The Iron Giant is one you have to watch. I would also have to say, Warner Bros. should be ashamed for the bad marketing they did for this movie; just like Brad Bird said, \"They had no idea what they had in their hands.\" This should have won a few Oscars and Golden Globes; it deserves it. 10/10 Stars***",

I also do not remember any 1950's communist paranoia in the book or the character of Hogarth being so young. But the changes do not harm the movie and the ending this film has is just fine. There are obviously no opening credits to the film so guessing the voices is cool fun. But it's impossible to guess who plays the Iron Giant.But the Iron Giant himself is a wonderful hero. It's cool to watch him learn simple things and having him eat cars is a neat little characteristic. I like when he's bored and he plays with the hood with one of the cars in the junkyard. You cannot dislike the Iron Giant.I think it was a wise and creative decision to make this cartoon in 2.35:1. Most cartoons by Disney are in 1.85:1 or even worse\u0085in 1.66:1. Warner did a great job with this movie. These days it seems that Dreamworks SKG and Disney seem to do all the feature length animations. But Warner beat them all in 1999 with this movie.My only gripe is that it should have been longer. At 87 minutes, it's all over too quick. But it's still cool.",

            "content": "The roaring success of Disney's The Lion King (no pun intended) in 1994 inspired something of an animation boom, during which various production studios attempted to cash in on the trend to varying degrees of success. Warner Bros. Feature Animation had a moderate hit with Space Jam, but underperformed with the likes of Cats Don't Dance and Quest for Camelot. They had one bona fide hit with The Iron Giant, a truly wonderful little feature adapted from Ted Hughes' 1968 novel The Iron Man. It didn't leave much of a dent at the box-office, but found a loyal audience on home video. In the 19 years since its release, The Iron Giant is fondly remembered as one of best animated features of the 1990s, and saw director Brad Bird poached by a little up-and-coming studio called Pixar.In the fictional town of Rockwell, Maine in 1957, the residents are busy gazing up at the sky in fear of the Soviet Union's satellite Sputnik spying on them, and school children are shown Duck and Cover style educational films to prepare for a nuclear attack. In the surrounding forest, a huge object crashes down to Earth, alarming local fisherman Earl (M. Emmet Walsh). 9 year-old Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal) spends his nights watching cheesy sci-fi movies and dreaming of owning his own pet. His mother Annie (Jennifer Aniston) thinks they cause too much mess, a point that seems to be proven when young Hogarth accidentally releases a squirrel into the local diner. With his mother working late one night, Hogarth wanders into the woods and comes across the object Earl insists he saw: a giant alien robot (voiced by Vin Diesel) that enjoys munching everything from train tracks to the local power station.This kind of allegorical coming-of-age tale has been done before (think E.T. but with an adorable weapon of mass destruction), but rarely with such charm and genuine emotion. It's influence can be felt in everything from the recent Pete's Dragon remake and A Monster Calls, and it's no surprise that the film continues to attract new fans. The Iron Giant questions what would happen if a gun could feel. The titular giant occasionally turns aggressive in the face of possible danger, as the alien's true purpose becomes increasingly and unnervingly clear. But with no memory of his mission, it's down to Hogarth to teach metal hulk kindness, and the youngster does so in a way that only an innocent could. A moment in the woods sees the unlikely friends come across the corpse of a deer. At first, the giant cannot comprehend death as he can regenerate, but Hogarth manages to teach him about the finality of death. It's incredibly powerful, and it's message is even more relevant today than it was almost 20 years ago. We all have choices in life, and sometimes simple human kindness and empathy can be infinitely more powerful than brute force.",

Naturally, the government don't like the idea of some kind of potential threat, and both movies ultimately portray the government and/or army as the bad guys.The Iron Giant is just really charming. It's got a good heart, and even if the story is familiar, it's told well. The end is quite emotional, and the characters are fun throughout, and easy to care for or dislike.

A young boy soon makes friends with it, while a government agent investigates the sightings. The robot has forgotten who he is, but trouble arises when his built in defence mechanisms may be a danger to the small town. The Iron Giant is base on the book The Iron Man written by Ted Hughes. A book I remember from primary school. This adaptation has Americanized it, as well as making it more of a space themed Sci-Fi. The book had a battle with a space dragon, something I would have actually liked to see, even if it didn't work. The 50's setting is perfect for this kind of film. It's all about friendship, and being able to make choices no matter how we were raised. The giant is both sympathetic and cute, as well as being dangerous. It's the age old case of violence begets violence. I did find certain moments rushed in the film, as animation is usually short, but most of all I had trouble associating with Kent Mansley.

            "content": "It is 1957 in the small town of Rockwell, Maine, and America is in the midst of the Cold War, so naturally this gives the film an aura of unsettledness and paranoia. And also naturally, children are less concerned with this, and take more risks, and their naivety leads to some unforeseen consequences. Brad Bird sprinkles a little social commentary in it too; sometimes it's delightfully light like the mock educational short film that displays the proper nuclear bombing etiquette to school children, or it's loud and brusque like the panicked way that G-man Kent Mansley defers to military action and presence whenever possible. We have the usual children's film conventions which signal themselves loudly: the lone boy who is bullied and causes trouble beyond his intentions, the snappy but good natured mother who glares at him pointedly after this fiasco, and the rest of the town, adult and children alike, whom do not believe his tall tale of a giant robot from outer space. What saves it from being generic is Brad Bird's direction which creates charm and genuine childhood terror and discovery without being juvenile. He does this first and foremost in the animation. Hogarth is given due attention, especially to his facial expressions which are given a wide range of lopsided smiles, glares, creased grimaces and wide eyed stares; see as his feet motor on Looney Tunes style when he attempts to flee the robot, or a particularly lively moment where he tries to pray whilst shooing the robot out of the house (not an uncommon scansion in children's films but it is done well, with restraint and with just the right amount of humour). The same goes for the robot, digitally animated but made to look hand drawn, whom moves with a slow but endearing recklessness. In one particular moment, he is spoken to like a child, or a dog, as he refuses to stop following Hogarth. Vin Diesel's pitch dropped, monotonous voice acting is perfect for this sort of misguided character, and has helped cement the film's iconic lines (\"You stay. I go.\") The discovery of the robot initially is handled with great nuance. Though it may be a child who stumbles across it, it isn't overly cartoonish and generates just the right amount of wonder and apprehension. The first sighting is this gigantic low angle shot of its eyes lighting up the lighting storm and it is genuinely awe inspiring and terrifying. Then later, this is replicated in his second appearance, before he gets stuck and we first feel something that resembles sympathy, and this comes easier for a child. Kamen's score is also crucial; a lively percussive based piece as Hogarth dresses up as a soldier and prepares himself for battle, thrilling as Hogarth flees and then makes his decision to save the robot, and in the finale, twinkles optimistically before flourishing in full fanfare to give us the ending we all hoped for. And finally the sound design which is just as important in building the characterisation of the robot and the initial anticipation of a non-threat; a big creaky whoosh as the robot crouches down to Hogarth's level, without menace, then a gigantic boom as it falls over onto its bottom, and the entire screen, and each layer of trees in the background shakes vigorously. It is not hard to see why The Iron Giant has become a cult classic. It does not have the iconicity or the Spielberg draw of E.T., but its story is just as touching and heartfelt. Brad Bird has in time shown his animation mastery with his Pixar work in The Incredibles and Ratatouille, but this remains an important stepping stone. Who knew that a linguistically challenged, lumbering giant robot could becomes such an endearing superhero figure?",

            "review_title": "A Cinematic Landmark that Stood the Test of Time",
            "content": "Back in the late 90s, when most theatrical animation was trying to emulate the success of the Disney renaissance, along came a smaller albeit unique feature from Warner Bros. called The Iron Giant. Despite receiving critical acclaim, it was a box office flop on its original release due to poor marketing. However, thanks to a growing cult following on VHS and DVD, and the film's director Brad Bird creating Pixar powerhouses like The Incredibles and Ratatouille, the film eventually went from an underrated gem to one of the greatest animated features ever made. After over 20 years in its existence, I think it's time to owe back its debt.Set in 1950s America during the Cold War, the film follows Hogarth Hughes, who discovers and befriends a giant intergalactic metal robot. In response to the U.S. military, Hogarth must fend them off from destroying the Giant. The movie's main plot is a mix of the common young child meets strange creature narrative and the old fear of beings beyond our worlds common in 1950s sci-fi films. What makes the otherwise familiar storyline fascinating though is how it develops the Giant as a legitimate character, from letting its monstrous size tell many scenes themselves and Hogarth mentoring it like a father teaching its son all the advantages in becoming good, as if a machine could actually have a soul. As for the sci-fi aesthetic, the film cleverly plays around with the themes of paranoia from nuclear war common back then with a supernatural twist, since what's beyond their world was too much for them to even comprehend. Of all the films to blend thrilling sci-fi, atomic fear and heartfelt tenderness together, this movie knocks it right out of the ballpark.As this is a character driven story, almost every figure in the movie plays an important part in some shape or form. With Hogarth being a rebellious albeit responsible kid, he also has the misfortune of his single mother working overtime, which makes his role to the giant as a teacher all the more engaging. In fact, because the Giant is often curious about the new world of Earth, he learns more from the values of friendship and life through Hogarth and the beatnik artist Dean, making their bonds all the more sincere and heartwarming. Speaking of Dean, he's more of a hip outcast to society that makes his own artwork from scrap and junk, yet that all leads to him reluctantly becoming part of the Giant's presence. Then there's the antagonist Kent Mansley, who perfectly represents how the government wanted America to think in the 50s, as he believes anything outside the U.S. and Earth is a threat and must be destroyed for the \"good\" of humanity. Rarely have animated characters been this relatable and this human before, including a giant metal robot.Even for a movie that strayed away from the Disney formula in the 90s, the film is animated nearly as well as any product from the Mouse House. Brad Bird is known for his exaggerated and stylistic character designs, and this film is no exception, as every character sticks out based on their physique and personality. The character animation adds in smooth movements, realistic attributes common in human anatomy and bold gestures that sell the performances. However, the film's true highlight has to be the CG work done on the Giant itself, as the crew created it with a cel-shaded approach that helps it blend extraordinarily well with the hand-drawn characters. The lack of overly detailed lighting also helps, since it keeps the contrast of the Giant simple and easy to look at without coming off as distracting. Also, major applause must be given to the cinematography and shot composition, as every color and every single frame conveys what the scene is communicating emotionally, whether it'd be completely visual with no dialogue or an intense thrilling scene with quick cuts and frightening glares.Needless to say, The Iron Giant stands the test of time thanks to its heartfelt story, themes of acceptance over fear, lovable characters and wonderful animation. If you're yet to check this film out for yourself, then this is a must watch for anyone, not just film and animation buffs. It's not common that a feature communicates the idea that supposedly dangerous weapons could actually have a soul to them, yet this film found a way to do so through humor, pathos and ideologies that are still common today. Remember, even things we might take for granted can have more substance than we give them credit for.",

My kids really enjoy it but I don't think they really appreciate the message that it is trying to put across. (well, my 4 year old anyway) My 7 year old just likes it for the bang factor. (the explosions and stuff!) I was a bit disappointed though that the giant didn't have more to say. It would of been nice to know were he came from and why. I had no idea at all that the voice of the giant is Vin Diesel! I would never of thought that he would do anything like this. Just goes to show how many actors are typecast. I got quite tearful at the end, especially when the giant says his last line about being Superman. I mean this is ludicrous! A grown woman crying over what is basically a cartoon!!! Maybe a sequel to this film could happen?If you haven't seen it yet, please make an effort to do so.",

            "content": "Set in 1957 when the Cold War was at its height and the Soviets shortly after the Soviets had put Sputnik into orbit people are understandably somewhat paranoid. When a giant robot falls from the sky the only witness is believed to be imagining things at first but young Hogarth Hughes believes him and goes out to investigate; he finds the huge robot devouring the metal at an electricity substation. While he is watching the robot is electrocuted and but he saves it by turning off the power. The robot appears friendly and starts to follow him home; unfortunately he causes a train crash and soon afterwards Government Agent Kent Mansley arrives and sets about searching for the robot; his only clue leads him to the Hughes household where he soon suspects Hogarth knows far more than he is letting on. Hogarth manages to hide the giant in the local scrap yard, which is run by Dean McCoppin; a friendly beatnik who uses the scrap to make his 'art'. Eventually it emerges that while the robot is friendly it has formidable defensive capabilities that could make it extremely dangerous if attacked... which is just what happens when Mansley gets the army in.This film is a real delight; it has a slightly retro look and nicely captures the Cold War paranoia and childhood innocence. The animation looked great; the characters didn't look 'cartoony' and the scenery looked great. The story is a solid sci-fi drama that, while aimed at children, can be enjoyed by older viewers. The voice actors, who include some big names, do a fine job bringing the characters to life. The story itself had plenty of exciting moments as well as a few laughs. There are also a few poignant moments that deal with death and may cause a tear or two to be shed... and not just by younger viewers! Overall I'd say this is a fine film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.",

Vin Diesel, even though not saying much, delivers the voice of the Giant with heart, passion and conviction.And I have not yet touched on the humor! There were many parts during this film that had me laughing in hysterics! Bird truly has a knack for making us laugh.Lastly, this movie truly has a message to it that I firmly believe in. Passive to some, obvious to others, the message of The Iron Giant rings true to us all as The Giant gently says \"I am not a gun\".A true tear-jerker in the best way, The Iron Giant is a film of greatness that all should experience and enjoy.10/10",

            "content": "Brad Bird's \"The Iron Giant\" is, in my opinion, a flawless and superb animated film that is well suited for the entire family. I saw it once in the theater and loved it from the start. A few years passed by before I saw it again and I loved it even before upon my second viewing. As I've gotten older, I've come to respect it even more for being a film of quality substance, excellent animation, humor, voice casting, and even great action sequences. It's a film that's not afraid to get violent from time to time, not even to show a tad bit of blood, but it doesn't go over its head to disturb the kiddies too much. That's why parents are recommended to view it with them.The animation designs of the characters and the voice actors who made them come to life verbally was absolutely perfect. The voice of Hogarth, our main human character, fitted very well with the animated design of the character. The character of Dean was just as good at being humorous and was not under-developed. The character of Kent Mansley, our main antagonist, was very well designed and acted. His overly large and forward-jutting eyebrows as well as his slender head and relatively calm voice was perfect for an animated villain. But who really steals the show is the Iron Giant himself, a giant hundred-foot-tall extra-terrestrial invention made of metal but containing a vast array of emotions, feelings, and thoughts somewhere within his several-ton metal body.Like I stated earlier, this film is not afraid to show a little violence or hard action. In fact, there's a lot of it. And it does not become overly powerful to be frightening, except maybe to young kids. Another thing is that it's not afraid to use a minimal amount of vulgar language, which is another reason why parental discretion is advised. But we have gunshots, explosions, and plenty of destruction on screen. But with no carnage. As far as I know, there is no body count in the entire film, which is appropriate. It makes the film suited for everybody.Aside from the action sequences, we have an extremely well-written storyline and plot. And it knows exactly which subplots of the film to emphasize and which ones to keep a minimal level, such as a small romantic subplot. It is shown enough to make the story compelling, but does not become too involved to distract us or slow the movie down. \"The Iron Giant\" almost seems a little bit too short for its brilliance, but nonetheless, it does play at a very reasonable running time.Bottom line, this is one of the best animated films there is out there. I highly recommend it for its brilliant animation styles, lovable characters, somewhat original plot, and overall style. It works out very well.",

            "content": "The greatest compliment I could give this film is that I have viewed it twice, as an 11 year in the cinema, and as an 18 year old at home, and enjoyed and loved it on both occasions. It's been said already, but this film really does combine the best of both worlds. It's silly and slapstick enough to make the kids laugh, and has enough subtle and sophisticated humour for the adults too. In fact, the comedy is what makes this film so special. The jokes are consistently excellent, and it's highly unlikely that anyone can keep a straight face throughout. It's funnier than the Disney/Pixar efforts, save Toy Story, and in fact it's better than most comedies you'll see.The characters are great too. Hogarth Hughes ( Eli Mariental) is actually not that annoying for a Hollywood kid. His double-act with the Giant (Vin Diesel) is entertaining and endearing. Halfway through, Beatnik Dean McCoppin (Harry Connick Jnr) is added to the mix, and together it's a highly amusing triumvirate. However, the show, and the best lines, are stolen by FBI agent Ken Mansley (Christopher McDonald). Mansley is the ideal kid's movie villain, just bumbling and stupid enough to be humorous, but with enough menace to get by. His interrogation of Hogarth itself is chilling, as is his hate of the giant, demonstrated during the finale. The other character of note is Hogarth's mum, Annie (Jennifer Aniston). She isn't a prominent part of the story, which is strange given that Aniston is the biggest name in the cast list. But thankfully, she doesn't wreck the film either.The film is at it's weakest when it's trying to be profound, and there are certainly a few cheesy lines as a result. However the film carries a decent anti-war message, as well as preaching acceptance to those who are different, which is to be applauded in a kid's film. In particular, the Giant's initial refusal to allow himself to become the weapon he was designed to be is well done. Even better is his subsequent rage and rampage at Hogarth's apparent death at the hands of the army, which shows us we can all go off the deep end sometimes. That's pretty deep for a U-rated picture.Other things to note are the animation, which is excellent, different from the Pixar style, but impressive nonetheless. The 50's soundtrack is great too, adding authenticity.In conclusion this is a film that really punches above it's weight, providing great comedy and a decent message that anyone of any age can enjoy. It's said often, but this really is a film that the whole family CAN enjoy. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "The Iron Giant is one of the best animated films of the 1990's. It has everything you could ask for in a movie and it covers some great topics. It covers topics such as cold war tensions, childhood, and it even has an underlying message about anti violence and being yourself. The story follows a gentle robotic giant who befriends a young boy. The giant has no recollection of his origin, or what he was designed for, but the young boy, Hogarth Hughes, tries to teach him about things, similar to how a parent teaches a little kid. At the same time, Hogarth also tries to hide the Giant and protect him from anyone who wants to destroy him. Unfortunately, not everything is well. A shady government agent is bent on trying to find the giant at all costs. The animation is very colorful and very well drawn. The voice talents are all very good. What's interesting to me is how Vin Diesel, who later went on to be in action movies like Fast and the Furious and xXx, was the voice of The Iron Giant before all of that. This movie has a great story, and there is a good message underneath it all. Kids should definitely see this, and adults should too. Even though it looks like a kids movie, adults will be able to get something out of it and enjoy it as well. Another thing this movie pulls off that many cartoons are unable to is to make you feel certain ways. When Hogarth and the giant are playing around and doing fun things, it puts you in a good mood. Later in the movie, when certain things happen to certain characters, you feel the way they feel.Director Brad Bird later went on to make the excellent animated movie, The Incredibles. He has made some good movies, so I hope he can make even more good movies.The Iron Giant is a brilliant animated movie, and as I said before, it has great animation and a great story, along with memorable characters, and a great underlying message. This is easily one of the best animated movies of the 1990's, and it has great elements. There is humor, but smart humor, not mindless fart jokes. There is never a dull moment, or a dumb moment. At certain points, there is action. Normally action at the end of a movie makes it that much more entertaining. It's very rare when you find a cartoon with all of these elements, and when everything works out perfectly. I recommend this for anyone, kids or adults, even teenagers.",

The opposite of this movie would be the execrable \"Independence Day\", where the whole decidedly was a good deal less than the sum of the pieces.Part of his crafting solution is to take a story set in the past, that's about the past, and keeping the feel of the visual and vocal expression in the past -- no referential pop-culture hokum. Obviously, this is composed from parts of \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\", \"E.T.\", \"Terminator 2\", \"Godzilla\" and countless 50's B movies. What matters is that this is smarter than all those put together. The way this shatters old perspectives is placed directly in the visual narrative -- the part where the kid watches the brainlessly stupid movie about the man-eating brain -- all intended to point out the superior intelligence of what we have here.Secondly, the use of the Giant's exaggerated height gives Bird the advantage of exaggerating the perspective of the 'camera'. He gets to play with focus and composition -- this is superbly detailed from every angle and in every trajectory...Anime without the losses in translation.",

            "content": "THE IRON GIANT (1999) ***Starring the voices of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., Christopher McDonald, and Eli Marienthal Directed by Brad Bird. Running time: 87 minutes. Rated PG (for animated violence and mild language) By Blake French:\t\"The Iron Giant\" is much like a cartoon version of \"E. T: The Extraterrestrial\" and \"Star Kid.\" It is an effective, empathetic journey into the life of its characters. Although the film is animated, it keeps a mature edge on its concepts. There are no outrageous characters, over the top musical numbers, or a bombarding number of shallow, unbelievable happenings. This is an animation in which children will enjoy for its message, but also adults because of its qualities and depth. If we were to replace the cartoons with real people, that would be possible here. That is how down to earth this movie is.\tThe story details the life of a lonely boy named Hogarth Hughes, who is about nine years of age. He lives a very dual and boring lifestyle with his mother, Annie. He has made a hobby of gathering animals from the wild to be his household pets. His mother is a very busy individual, working full time as a waitress for a small town coffee shop.\tThis is a fabulous, descriptive opening. We learn several elements about the characters, structure, as well as the movie's style. We learn that Hogarth's single mother is extremely busy and has little time with her son. We also see that due to the significant time this child spends alone, he has a great imagination. This is the internal problem, that Hogarth is somewhat lonesome spending all this time by himself. This film has well-developed characters, better than some more adult movies.\tOne day, while alone in the house watching television, something happens to Hogarth. His electrical power supply to his TV set goes bad. In a desperate attempt to fix the problem, he climbs on the roof of his house to discover half his antenna has been bitten off. What could have done this? The first clue is the massive footprints leading into the woods. Whatever made these prints destroyed everything in its path. The thing that caused the destruction, technical difficulties, and placed colossal holes in the ground, is a massive iron giant from space who has recently crash landed on earth. Hogarth quickly greets the robot and makes friends with it. The story propels from there after we see the humanity and gentle attitude of the android whom we share empathy with and are able to understand and relate to. The first act is solid and clear cut, proving to us that this is not only a well-animated cartoon, but also a well structured one. \tThe film introduces the external problem when an insane detective places his nose where it doesn't belong and discovers the gigantic metal creature. Hogarth is forced to keep his robot secret so that it is not taken away. This detective's purpose in \"The Iron Giant\" serves as more than meets the eye. His motives are understandable and developed, although shows signs of existing as a plot device rather than a real character. Also, he is used to increase the line of dramatic tension as he grows closer and closer to finding the robot. This is a very sufficient and well-written character who contributes to a lot of positive material and many possibilities for the film.  The only problem I had with the film is how it never actually explained what the iron giant was. It is an amazing creature, able to heal itself, shoot out lasers, contribute in conversations, and yet we never know how it is able to do these things. Did it come from another plant seeking help for its dying race? Is it on a mission to gather important materials for its existence? Perhaps the android was built by a cruel human inventor on earth but was overtaken by the size of it ands thus allows it to escape into space and become lost--leaving the iron giant no choice but to return to his home where he discoursed along the way and crashed. The possibilities are endless. Too bad the filmmakers took such a shallow look at our title character, otherwise, this would have been one of the year's most entertaining family films.

It respects the audience's intelligence, it has genuine emotion without resorting to schmaltz, and best of all it balances fantasy (well, science fiction) with believability. I think Warner Brothers animation has out-Disneyed Disney by adding thoughtful writing to clean, understanding animation. With a concept! It may not be the original, it's kind of like E. T. if he was made of metal and was a giant, and he befriends a boy that easily befriends him back, but it's directed by the guy who gave us The Incredibles and Ratatouille, that's right, Brad Bird! One of the best directors in animation gave us beauty of a film. Too bad it wasn't a hit because Warner Brothers pulled almost all the advertising of it after the failure of Quest For Camelot.During the Cold War in 1957, a young boy named Hogarth Hughes, who discovers and befriends a giant alien robot. With the help of a beatnik artist named Dean McCoppin, who Hogarth attempts to prevent the U. S. army and Kent Mansley, a paranoid federal government agent, from finding and destroying the Giant.And that was The Iron Giant, and it was the best animated film from Warner Brothers I have ever seen, as well as Big Bird's best next to his PIXAR films.The film's plot is similar to E. T. - a young boy meets an alien robot from outer space, who was stranded on earth, and runs afoul of paranoid government agents. Not to knock the Spielberg film, but what makes The Iron Giant the better film in terms of writing is that the young boy is the teacher. It is who has to make. The Iron Giant, it turns out, is a weapon, who has to struggle against his own nature. The film has an obvious (and timely) gun control message, but its real message is about the choice we make when dealing with other people. We can use our powers for good or lash out at everyone around us.The Iron Giant is refreshing non-Disney in no end of ways. Characters seem real and chosen to fit the story, instead of being a superficial reshuffling of an old formula. The animation definitely has its eye-popping moments, but there are also scenes of great wonderment, pathos, and humor that only top-drawer animation can convey. The Giant itself is a great character, who only becomes MORE interesting as the film continues (another huge break from Disney). No scene is wasted in this film, either; every set piece, even the really funny ones, helps either to establish the \"world\" of the movie, or to advance the plot. At no time do you feel that you are merely waiting for the story to crank up again. And thankfully it wasn't a musical which is a step up because almost every animated film of the 90's had to be a Disney musical which thankfully this one wasn't. It's also underrated but has one big fan base and I've enjoyed this movie since the film was new and that's over 20 years of watching it. Please, Hollywood can we have more films like this?I highly recommend this movie to those who love animation and great storytelling. It's my favorite Warner Brothers movie and does sit high among my favorite films of all time. Top 10 in my book.10/10.",

This man clearly has a knack for making movies. Let's start off with the first thing::CASTING- The casting on this film is so great you can picture these voice actors doing a live-action interpretation of this film.ANIMATION- A unique style of animation that gives realism and quality.HUMOR- Brad Bird is good at this. Kent Mansley is the type of villain you dislike, but love to make fun of, especially when he is on his craziest moments.And Lastly:CHARACTERS- The Iron Giant himself is a very emotional and well written character, Hogarth is a likeable protagonist and you feel for them both when they are in danger or apart.I remember seeing the Iron Giant on VHS. And loving it, now that VHS is long past, I've purchased it on Blu-Ray and love the signature edition of the film. If you haven't seen this movie, you're missing a great deal. Watch it, I guarantee you that you will have a good time.",

With a maturity that beautifully captures the importance of discussing these issues. Which respects the younger viewers as well not minimizing the reality of these themes. What makes this so important, is that younger people will eventually be the one's making the decisions. Whether they are voters and lawmakers.According to the reality of our species. Teaching them important life lessons is the primary reason why quality children's entertainment is so important. The Iron Giant embodies this perfectly.With beautiful animation, a charming cast, and a remarkable maturity. The Iron Giant easily is one of the greatest animated films ever. Along with being one of the most powerful anti-war films as well. Truly this is one film that everyone should watch. Regardless of age, because this in every sense, is timeless.",

I decided to check out Atlantis as well, and The Iron Giant is far superior to that humdrum, boring Disney flick! The Iron Giant himself has the sweetest personality.

            "content": "I'm so glad that I finally found this masterpiece five year after this movie has been released. This is a really great movie and in my opinion it's one of the best animated movies ever made. I think the biggest flaw of the Disney animation is the complete lack of human characters. Disney and now Dreamworks made movies about fishes, sharks, bears, lions, dogs, bugs, ants, toys, superheroes and many other animals and creatures but you can hardly find single movie with human character from a real life . Well, all their characters can talk, feel and behave like humans but it is not the same. Most of their recent movies were good, funny and entertained but at the same time they look a bit childish and not so emotional, even cold. They are typical commercial stuff and with strong marketing studios often get good box office returns. The Iron Giant is a different case. This is a very intelligent, good-feeling and enjoyable animation with powerful and clever moral messages in its core. At first sight it looks like a kids movie but it's a wonderful movie both for kids and adults. In fact the movie idea could have been unnoticed for small kids. The story happens in 1957 in small town in Maine. It was a years of the cold war and military paranoia, a period of total fear and misunderstanding from both sides. It was really amazing to watch how brilliant was recreated the atmosphere of that period. All begins than the Hogarth, a young fatherless lonely boy found near his home mysterious Iron Giant. I think it was s a clever idea what we'll never know where this giant come from. Different and unknown doesn't always mean bad and enemy. Hogarth helped him and they become friends. He gave Iron Giant some moral lessons and even taught a basic English. But when in the town comes paranoiac special agent Kent Mansley they friendship now is in a danger. He wants to kill the Giant without any reasonable reason, just because he think what this strange robotic Iron Giant can be dangerous. Most surprising and intelligent element in the story was the fact that this movie didn't become a cheesy childish anti-gun propaganda. The message is more wise and intellectual. As Hogarth said we are what you we choose to be. Our acts are always our individual decisions and some things can't be simply bad or good, and only our choice can decide how we can use them. Also you can find in this movie many other strong philosophical ideas and thoughts. Overall, the story of friendship between young boy and The Iron Giant is very touching and emotional. Now about animation. It was absolutely fabulous. All movie is an amazing work of art. The Hogarth character so perfectly drown that you can easily forget that it's an animated movie. He looks like a real, well acted boy. I have seen almost all famous animated movies and I suppose he is a best animated character I have ever seen. The rest of main characters also very impressive, landscapes, sky and all minor details like ships and tanks were beautiful and looked absolutely real. The Iron Giant was the only computer-generated character and he didn't look as a soulless machine. He becomes a very warm and likable character. With excellent characters development and interesting story The Iron Giant is an extraordinary intelligent movie. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it's sad but it's always enjoyable, touching and entertained movie. If you haven't seen it before just go and buy, rent or borrow it. I recommend The Iron Giant to all people irrespective of their age. A solid ten. Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English.",

To be honest, when I heard about it, I thought the animation looked simplistic and was another straight to video deserving flik.But when I actually got to see it finally on TV it blew me away. Not only was the animation actually an artistic and in a few ways a technical achievement (nicely handled discrete use of CGI), the story and dialogue were far more sophisticated than the usual strand of kid's animation. So much so I became far more intrigued emotionally by the characters and the major plot twists then I have been by many live action movies. The humour was also subdued to short well timed bursts, not completely unbearable like some tripe i've experienced. The story is also told in a way that is logical; characters react accordingly to events and everything happens in a way that can't be questioned and is completely understandable, not overly simplified for the younger audience. Plus the ending was satisfying and a great way to round off an unforgettable experience.It's a shame therefore that such an emotionally vibrant and surprisingly mature animated movie has to be judged on how good it is just by how much cash it rakes in, a dire fate that many a movie has been subject to. 10/10",

Such a case is The Iron Giant. Many people are blaming its poor showing on Warner Bros lack of advertising, which is ridiculous. I dislike the idea that unless we're inundated with Happy Meal tie-ins and action figures, the film is under-advertised. There certainly was adequate advertising for this film; it simply wasn't in titanic Disney proportions.The Iron Giant is, no exaggeration, one of the best animated films of the last ten years. As a childhood fable, as a view of fifties foreign paranoia, as a statement on violence, it works perfectly. There isn't a single flawed scene from beginning to end. And it proves conclusively that animation can work without cute animal sidekicks or overwrought musical numbers; just a great story, brilliantly timed comedy, and some truly touching moments.The combination of cel animation and computer imagery is seamless, with each technique used to its best effect. The voice-acting is top-notch, with Christopher MacDonald particularly good as the paranoid government agent. Having not read the book myself, I can't vouch for the film's adherence to the original story, but I highly recommend it to any lover of animation.Incidentally, lest you think it's purely for children, I watched it with a group of men over thirty, and we all loved it. Let's hope this film gains the recognition on video it was denied in the theater. A solid 10.",

The movie is able to reproduce the mood and style of the era, even the animation style, but with all the improvements that technology has brought to animation.The characters are psychologically drawn with great talent, as it couldn't be otherwise by a Warner Bros's movie, and it is just them, their human qualities, what makes the viewer click with them and believe they are real. Moreover, the cartoons have a superb body movement, facial expression.The script is engaging and very entertaining, very funny and lovable. At the same time, the film address serious social and political issues in a simple approachable way, without lecturing: You are who you decide to be, if you respond to violence is your option., it is in your hands to make your own destiny no matter what your past is, your heart is always a great power to connect with others, no matter how different they are. Great messages to pass on to children.Eli Marienthal is terrific as the little hero Hogarth Hughes. Jennifer Aniston is extremely lovable as his mother Annie (perhaps Aniston's best performance ever...),.Harry Connick Jr is very likable as the quirky Dean McCoppin, Vin Diesel very sweet as the \"brute\" Iron Giant, and Christopher McDonald terrific as the annoying paranoid Govt Agent Kent Mansley. In fact all the voice actors are terrific, and the movie is never dull, but cheerful and full of life thanks to them.The Iron Giant did not have success at the box office when first released, due to poor marketing and a lack of promotion, but it has proved to be one of the most charming, entertaining and lovable animation movies of all times, to be put together with Miyazaki's and other classics of animation because of the quality of its animation and story.A classic for both children and adults",

At first I was skeptical after seeing the strange character design and some childish events.But I was impressed with some of the ideas presented in the movie.  The Iron Giant, really a child at heart, is a pretty cool character.  His CGI doesn't fit too well with the other animated scenery, but still interacts rather well.What I didn't like about Iron Giant was some of the \"perfect events\" that seem to plague today's movies.  For instance, a switch on a power plant to turn it on or off?  Come on!  And Hogarth's mother finds the flashlight within seconds of the power going off!  I found things like these kind of annoying.The final climactic moment seems a little out-of-place, since the movie was filled with heart all the way through.  Then the end is filled with military bombardment and attacks, which I found strange.  This action at the end is really cool, however, and I really liked it.Also, I found the ending only partially satisfying.  The movie breaks the traditional \"happy ending\" that American movies constantly have nowadays. The Giant's final sacrifice is amazing.  Here he was, a defensive device with the ability to take out the world if necessary, yet he jumped skyward and into a massive missile to save the inhabitants of a small town.  He isn't really killed, as we find in the end, but I kind of liked this, too, since at the beginning we found out that he was made to fall apart rather than shatter.The plot and story are simple.  Young boy finds giant robot, struggles to keep him out of sight.  Which proves to be obviously difficult and leads to some hilarious twists and turns.The Iron Giant is a really good movie, and I now have a little more respect for Warner Bros.  They've got an adult mindset for a movie that could have been advertised for children.  That seems to happen a lot now.  And it's annoying.  But Iron Giant didn't do this.  It was advertised and made for everybody.",

            "review_title": "A superb animation. And criminally underrated",
            "content": "Before Brad Bird found success with The Incredibles and Ratatouille, he directed this little seen film, The Iron Giant. Bird is one of the true auteur's of modern animation. Despite only three films to his name, the man is quite simply a genius. His films represent the finest examples of family entertainment. Ones that appeal to adults and children alike. And he understands what makes a film accessible to a child. You don't talk down to them. Just talk to them.The Iron Giant was given a curious lack of advertising by Warner Bros. It was just dumped into cinemas with very little advance notice. And not surprisingly, The Iron Giant did next to no business. And that is a real shame. Because its one of the greatest animated films you will ever see.Taking a leaf out of ET's book, and based on the short story by Ted Hughes, The Iron Giant follows the tale of a 100-foot robot that crashes to Earth in Rockwell, Maine, 1957. Bird has deliberately set the film in Cold War America. In fact the setting is just days after the Russians launched the Sputnik satellite. So the atmosphere is expectedly tense and paranoid. Most Americans of that era thought anyone who wasn't a member of the USA was their enemy. And its unfortunate The Iron Giant should have to land on Earth during such a dark era.Hogarth Hughes is a schoolboy obsessed with the stars. He watches all the classic B-movies. Collects all the comics. Has posters of Forbidden Planet proudly displayed on the walls of his bedroom. But when the TV goes on the blink one night, Hogarth goes outside and investigates. Their antenna has been bitten off the roof. Someone has left a trail of destruction behind them. Cars. Wagons. And when Hogarth follows them, he comes across The Iron Giant.When Hogarth saves him from being electrocuted at a power plant, the two become fast friends. Hogarth sort of adopts him, and has to go to great lengths to conceal him from the outside world. No easy task considering his insatiable appetite for metal. And when a government agent comes snooping around, it isn't long before war breaks out between the townspeople of Rockwell and the innocent Iron Giant.Anyone who hasn't seen this film must go out and buy it immediately. Because you are missing out on one of the most perfect family films ever conceived. Brad Bird never puts a foot wrong. He strikes the perfect balance between comedy, action and touching sentiment. Its a film where you never feel like you're being patronised or lectured to.Although ET did spring to mind while I was watching this film (and Bird has worked with Steven Spielberg in the past), I think The Iron Giant is far superior. ET felt (to me anyway) like a calculated attempt on Spielberg's part to push all the right emotional buttons at perfectly timed intervals. I never felt any manipulation during The Iron Giant.Bird crafts the friendship between Hogarth and his new friend with surprising sophistication. Hogarth's attempts to humanise the machine is conducted with real skill and expertise. Since Hogarth knows they're living in dangerous times, he knows exactly how the people will react if they saw The Iron Giant. They'll only see a monster. Something alien. And in they're minds, anything that's alien must be destroyed.Bird also does a great job evoking the atmosphere of 1950's Cold War America. The film has many accurate details that will immediately strike a chord with anyone of that era. Such as the disturbing Duck and Cover programmes. And Bird makes sure the fear and uncertainty of the times are neatly represented too. Like paranoid conspiracy nuts and straight arrow Army Generals.But the crux of the film is Hogarth's friendship with The Iron Giant. The way these two outsiders find a friend in each other. The film gets a lot of mileage out of the different adventures they get up to. Whether it be slapstick, like Hogarth doing a cannonball into a lake, and when the Giant tries it, he ends up draining all the water. Or sentiment, like when Hogarth discovers what the Giant really is.The film has a very strong anti-gun statement to make. None more so than the scene when the pair come across a deer in the woods shot by hunters. Hogarth makes a very impassioned speech about how its wrong to kill. And how to make the right choice.Its genuinely shocking to discover the Giant is a weapon. His crash to Earth has robbed him of that knowledge. But his programming kicks in whenever he feels threatened. Something not helped by the Army coming to take this 'monster' down.The Iron Giant has to make a choice between being a gun, and being a person. Which will he choose? Or will his programming make the choice for him? Pretty heady material for a so-called kids film.Brad Bird has a clear love of retro futurism, something he lavishly displayed in The Incredibles, and here too. The Iron Giant is a tall, galumphing behemoth. But Bird does a great job making him seem endearing, especially with a surprisingly animated metal face. And the different weaponry inside of him is pretty inventive too. He's got more add-ons than the Swiss Army!Things come to a very moving conclusion when the Giant must sacrifice himself for Hogarth and the people who hate him. Its very saddening, and will leave you feeling depressed for days afterwards. Odd to feel such compassion for an animated character isn't it?The Iron Giant is an unforgettable experience. One of the finest animated movies ever made. And all the more remarkable for having the ability to move and enchant you as much as it does.",

What really bothers me is the fact that this flick bombed at the box office, WHY? Did the Giant suffered enough already? Any way this is also one of the last hand drawn animated movies to be made before their type ,when close to extinct in the twenty first century. For just think how many animated flicks were in theaters(video movies don't count) in last decade and a half, which weren't made with computers, I am sure that three to five is the maximum number for most of us, for by experience know only five! FIVE, in Fifteen years !Now I don't for any reason hate Nemo, Toy Story ,WALL-E, Ice Age and Schrek, no are some of my favorites and Lego was hilarious. What I am saying is that Iron Giant apart from its great story, images and moments \"You stay ,I go, No following\" ,man I still cry when I think of it, had also the \"luck \" to see its kind in its last days of glory, before Pixar and Dreamworks took over the industry. #MOLOPOLY!To the film itself ,at the high of the space race a robot from space crash land in the USA and befriends a boy, which teach it, who to be like superman. The effects are great and even the setting look accurate for the fifties period, why it earn 23 million to a budget of 70? The answers are ,the Six Sense which opened the same week, with the Giant and blew audiences away and the themes were judged by many parents as too adult. For real I feel go to an adult in the twenty first century and see an animated film and not be laugh at for that, in the end a good flick, is a good flick, end of story, because that argument of 1999 is obvious stupid!If you haven't show it to your kids yet, do it, JUST DO IT! Bonus if Micheal Bay had think of making the Tranformers ,more in line of this film the films would be so much better.",

Sure, it does not pack the epic scope of The Lion King, but it is a very touching (but not schmaltzy) work and is one of those films that can literally bring a smile to your face that will not leave for days.Set in the 1950's, it tells of a young American boy obsessed with science fiction comics and movies, who befriends a massive, alien robot that has crash landed in the countryside surrounding his home. The two form a bond as he gradually teaches the giant about his world and the story then focuses on his attempts to keep the giant hidden from a US government official and the military. Not easy when you're a 30 feet tall, clanking mechanical marvel with footprints the size of cars.Along the way, there are plenty of sly touches. The feel of the 1950's is perfectly realised with milkshake shops, bad horror films and the sense of paranoia that came from being one of two super powers dominating the world. The animation too is beautifully done, with even the metallic eyes of the Giant displaying tremendous emotion behind them. The story at times is very sentimental, but it's also loaded with a knowing sense of wry humour and though this may be a film with a child audience squarely in mind, I defy even the toughest of souls not to feel a little choked up come the ending.",

            "content": "This combination hand-drawn/computer animation film was the directorial debut of Brad Bird. There will be spoilers ahead: This is an extraordinary mix of two different animation techniques and it manages this amazingly well. Based on an excellent novel by Ted Hughes, though it was critically acclaimed (deservedly so) it performed poorly in its initial run at the theaters, probably because the marketing left much to be desired. It's managed to find its audience through home video and word of mouth and it now gets the appreciation it deserves.I'll just to a basic synopsis of the plot and discuss the technical aspects a bit. Set in 1957, just after Sputnik's launch, a huge robot crashes just off the coast of Maine. It comes ashore and eventually meets a young boy named Hogarth. After a series of misadventures and the robot's near destruction and recovery, Hogarth starts teaching the robot various things through reading him comic books. The robot is impressed with Superman.Needless to say, the crash of the robot and his actions draw the attention of the authorities, represented by a smarmy jackass working as an FBI agent and an Army general. Hogarth tries to hide the robot, which, given its size, is no easy task. He gets the help of a proto-hippie/beatnik/sculptor who runs the junkyard (this comes in handy, because the robot eats metal).The FBI and the military become aware of the robot eventually and through a series of misunderstandings and outright lies, the military moves to destroy the robot, even to the point of setting up a nuclear strike from a sub. The jackass government agent sets in motion certain destruction of the town, only to have the robot perform an heroic act to save everyone. The ending of the film is perfect.The technical aspects of the film are great, from a top-notch script through great voice work, magnificent animation, a perfect score for the film and the timing is excellent. The film won a good many animation awards and was lauded by critics at the time. It's a fantastic film.This film is available on DVD and was released on Blu-Ray this year (2015) in a \"Signature Edition\", which I have yet to see. Regardless, this film is most highly recommended.",

            "content": "The enigma of the Iron Giant's complex nature is a literary device to make us look at ourselves.  The Giant is a mirror of humanity; making him a space alien is a way of bringing another perspective to our human nature.  On the one hand, we humans seem to be programmed as death machines.  On the other hand, we have compassionate souls.  Which will predominate?  The key to the whole story is simply \"You are what you choose to be.\"  Your innate compassion can override your death program.The character of Mansley the bad guy is so malicious as to be actually psychotic.  His only function is to show the madness of the human death programming taken to extremes.  It makes us look back on the Cold War and wonder what the hell went wrong.  The name \"Mansley\" symbolically reflects on Man, who has allowed this insanity to run away with the human race.  The Giant's choice of compassion over death programming is inspiring and uplifting; to get that across in a movie any more you have to disguise it as a kid's movie, but this one is equally enjoyable for kids and adults alike.The technical side of this film shows the impressive advances in conventional animation, to remind us that computer animatronics are not necessarily the last word in this art form.  The most stunning light shows, however, involve weapons of mass destruction.  The Giant's seemingly miraculous ability to regenerate himself as well as whip out a mind-boggling array of destructive devices reminds me of Arthur C. Clarke's dictum: \"Any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic.\"",

            "content": "Affectionately crafted, mesmerisingly told & gorgeously animated, The Iron Giant is a wonderful marriage of traditional & computer animation from Warner Bros. Animation that not only triumphs as a technical marvel of its genre but is also the most heartwarming, emotionally resonant & thoroughly intimate narrative to surface on the silver screen since Pixar's very own Toy Story.Set in the late 1950s during the Cold War, The Iron Giant tells the story of Hogarth Hughes; a lonely but smart kid raised by his mother who one day comes across a giant metal robot that fell from space & soon befriends the innocent alien. And with the help of a junkyard owner, he tries to save the fifty-foot, metal-eating robot from the paranoid government that intends to find & destroy the Giant.Directed by Brad Bird, The Iron Giant marks his feature film debut & is a work of impeccable craftsmanship from start to finish. There is no irrelevant moment in its story, every sequence has a role to play, the various themes it deals with brilliantly captures the fear & paranoia present in the society in those times, and the way it all adds up into an engaging & thought- provoking cinema speaks volumes about Bird's talents as a filmmaker.The whole plot maintains a playful tone despite dealing with some serious issues, has a very fluid feel to it coz of which the events unfold in a smooth manner, the 2D animation is exquisitely handled & meticulously detailed plus the CGI element is seamlessly integrated into it, voice cast is wisely chosen, use of colours isn't extensive but it works in its favour, pacing is steady and the background score provides a very personal feel to the story.On an overall scale, The Iron Giant is one of the greatest animation features of last century that deserves to be seen by every cinema lover out there. Presenting a firm control over all aspects of filmmaking, cleverly balancing its refined drama with clever wit & riding on the strength of its highly gripping story, crisply defined characters & terrific animation, The Iron Giant is endearing, entertaining & enlightening in equal doses and is a timeless treasure in every sense of the word.A roller-coaster ride of emotions that's sure to leave its audience both smiling & teary-eyed by the time it ends, The Iron Giant is absolutely worth your time & money and comes one hundred percent recommended.",

The Giant is essentially a war machine, his purpose to conquer and lay waste to entire civilizations. Not unlike Frankenstein, he's ostracized and feared merely for existing. But from friendship he learns mankind's capacity to do good even in the face of impossible danger, and ultimately, sacrifices himself out of love.I liked how we don't get to know where exactly the robot came from, or why it's here. I think that we're supposed to draw our own conclusions when we see strange visitors from the starry sky. And because we naturally fear what we don't understand, we feel the need to destroy it. Because it makes us look at ourselves in the mirror, and question our own purpose and existence. Maybe the things that fall from the heavens are too good for this world.",

On paper, it's practically an animated version of E.T, but the film works despite the non-original story. It is full of substance and style with an underlying political commentary that will appeal to the adults. The kids will love the gorgeous animation (very good for a 1999 film) and the story about an unlikely friendship. I haven't seen this in many, many years until recently, but it was always one of my childhood standouts.Brad Bird's earliest theatrical film is about a kid named Hogarth befriends a giant robot from another world, during the height of the Cold War and the launch of Sputnik. Hogarth tries to protect the giant-sized robot not only from his mother, but also from a bunch of bureaucrats believing the giant is actually a spy for the Soviet Union.The voice acting is not that bad. The robot does not speak English at first, but when he does, it was voiced by Vin Diesel who made the robot seem even more lifelike. We also have some solid voice acting from the likes of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., and Eli Marienthal.Overall, The Iron Giant is one of those rare gems that appeal to both adults and children. The story is executed well enough against the backdrop of political and historical issues and the film is also a visual spectacle with the animation way beyond its time. Who cannot resist a film among the veins of ET, especially one that is good as this. It's a beautiful, must-see film. I rate this film 9/10.",

It is something that adults can relate to with the myriad of reference to 50s culture, and both children and adults will love its innocence.The film is drawn in a classical animation style like early Disney films to give the audience a feel of the time in which it is set.  Unlike recent Disney films (thankfully), The Iron Giant does not have any cutesy little \"friends\" that serve as comic relief or to create nausea for the viewer. Instead, the filmmaker respects the audience's intelligence (both children and adults) by giving us a simple story that does not rely on embellishment to make itself more viewer friendly.  It doesn't need it.The author started with a concept - what if a gun had a soul? - and created this brilliant animated feature in the same vain of Spielberg's E.T.-The Extra-Terrestrial.  It stands as a testament to what animated films should be (it is possibly the best in over 50 years), but what's more, it stands as a testament to what FILMS should be.

            "content": "I liked The Iron Giant, I liked it a lot. The film, surely, has to be recognised as one of the last, great two dimensional animated films that the Americans made at the back end of an era. If we formally acknowledge that the new 'era' of animation is, or was, from 1999 onwards predominantly three dimensional from an American perspective, then this is the last great film of that time. Here is an animated film that does not rely on purely the visual, even if they are as impressive as they need to be and opts for story telling and emotional involvement more than anything else. Sprinkle on a little bit of Cold War paranoia and you have The Iron Giant, a period set character study of a human being and a creature not of this world.The film is one of which it is difficult to not just sit there, and stare in both wonder but more importantly appreciation at what's being presented to you. While both colourful and atmospheric, I was most impressed with director Brad Bird's attention to character detail when it came to the animation. It's the little things; the way in which the Iron Giant himself moves around in the manner in which he does. The Iron Giant is big and hulking but its presence is juxtaposed with the very fragile and delicate relationship he has with a young boy, who is established to be pretty desperate for a friend or companion early on. The Giant's presence and traits are comparable to the only villainous character of the piece, an F.B.I. agent who's grossly smaller than The Giant but seems more threatening despite the height difference and jolts about in an urgent and jittery manner giving off an entirely different feeling to that of the large, lumbering but friendly robot.Bird's work here reminded me of Nick Park's Wallace and Gromit series, a series which I feel has since partly been inspired by The Iron Giant. There is that knowing feeling behind the production; that setting in the past and that referencing to what the filmmaker enjoys or grew up enjoying, indeed The Iron Giant's tag-line is 'It came from outer space!', maybe a nod to Hollywood science fiction films of the 1950s and 60s that dealt with the fear of impending Communist-related invasions. The link is uncanny \u0096 a giant robot the most antagonistic character of the film, believed to be Russian, sent to 'the good ol' U.S.A.' in order to destroy the nation from within.The hero of the title is a nine year old boy named Hogarth Hughes (Marienthal) and lives with his mother Annie (Aniston) and in a desperate attempt to prolong some sort of relationship with another being other than his mother, he brings home little animals not exactly fit for household domestication. The establishment introduces this fact and acts as a good introduction to post-modern artist, working in a time not ready for the post-modern, Dean McCoppin (Connick Jr.) who's a friend and ally for them later on. After some other initial events, a large robot voiced by Vin Diesel, who merely has to supply some grunts and other such noises that eventually turn into synthesised words, comes into contact with Hogarth and they strike up a friendship following a train-wreck.Enter F.B.I. agent Kent Mansley, played by Christopher McDonald in the sort of slimy role you'd associate with him, in all his paranoid glory. I think initially, we don't really mind if Mansley gets his prize. He makes some enquiries and asks about but he's just doing his job. We know about as much about it as he does and it hasn't really earned its place in our hearts but it's not until Bird brilliantly brings together both the Giant's friendship with the boy and Kent's gradual obsession with the capturing of the robot until we veer more into a thought process that demands we don't want to see him get his man.Echoing what Bird sets up at the beginning, The Giant acts as a fatherly figure for Hogarth; wearing a constant smile on his face and vastly becoming one of the friendliest non-human components to a relationship involving children we've seen on screen. From the Cold War era sci-fi films of the 1950s onwards to Spielberg's E.T. and Cameron's second Terminator film, the referencing and inspirations flow and flow. Additionally, the other feelings I got amidst all this harked way back to comedy of the silent era and the use of heartfelt music and shots of character's reactions while humorous exchanges were played out \u0096 it seems Bird's knowledge and love of cinema-past knows no end.Despite this phenomenon of a giant robot landing on Earth and a child taking a likening to it, the film looks at the identity of the robot more than it does anyone else. As a grey and hulking thing, is possesses neither the colour to place it into any particular category nor the necessary intelligence to place it within another. What reminded me of the second Terminator film apart from the obvious fatherly connotations was the scene in which the boy teaches it the difference between good and evil, and the poor kid uses all the facilities available to him, which peak at mere comic books, to give this creature some sort of identity and how he can be 'good' like Superman instead of 'bad' like the typical 'destroy the world' aliens \u0096 perhaps a reference to more recent blockbusters like Independence Day which rely on flashy visuals, hostile aliens and zero logic. The Iron Giant is the opposite of this and is vastly superior. Towards the end, there is one lump in the throat moment and I don't think the immediate ending does the film a disservice. The Iron Giant is truly a special animation for children and adults alike.",

I would even go so far as to put this film in my Top 10 list for 1999.\nTHE IRON GIANT not only had a positive message, but was funny and heart-warming too. As a guy who is totally at odds with the unduly graphic, formulaic, impersonal and dumbed-down movies of this era, it was a unique experience for me to walk out of a movie feeling good about what I just saw. For example, although FIGHT CLUB (8.5/10) is easily one of the top five movies of the year, I must admit that I did not feel particularly good when I left the theatre that day. Shocked is the word that comes to mind, but \"good\" is not one of them. After thinking over the films I had seen so far this year, not unsurprisingly, almost none of them made me feel good. Oh, I may have been intellectually stimulated, but was I encased in a field of positive energy? No. If you want a big, warm fuzzy, this film, THE IRON GIANT, is certainly the one to watch.8/10",

Set in a cold-war paranoid America of 1957, the titular creature cash lands from outer- space, with a knock on his giant metal head leaving him with amnesia about his purpose or history. After being saved by a 9 year old boy, a series of at first comic, then later more serious adventures begin. There's some very funny jabs at the cold war mentality, and some terrific, unusual supporting characters, including a mom more interesting and complex than you find in most cartoons, and a local wanna-be beatnik artist who joins in to take the giant iron man's cause. I love the look they designed for the Iron Giant himself, there's something wonderfully retro and almost art deco about him, and they do a great job of bringing heart and emotion to this gigantic metal creature.

There was clearly a dig at Disney by opening with an ocean storm as most Disney animation starts with that (i.e. \"Little Mermaid\" and \"Tarzan,\" etc.) or maybe animators just like doing storms. This is done very much like \"Day the Earth Stood Still,\" a throw-back to old '50's sci fi films with a dash of \"The X Files,\" including a satire of Fox Mulder's character. There's references kids won't get, like the \"Duck and Cover\" cartoons, Sputnik and general Cold War paranoia, which I remember quite well.Nice that there's actually some sympathetic adults in this, especially the sculptor/junk yard dealer where the Giant hangs out.But I did miss Townsend's music, even if they bought him off with a producer credit.(originally written 8/22/1999)",

            "content": "Now first off, I must set the table before we can dig into the meat of this review. This movie was not made by the likes of Disney Animation or their then-fledgling affiliate and now property, Pixar. It was made by Warner Bros. Now, in the 90s, particularly the late nineties, there were a rush of animated movies not made by Disney or any real animation company that won't happen again. It was an interesting time for animation. Not a good one, perhaps; other than this film, the best of these so-called second-string animated movies (not counting TNBC, which is stop-motion) by common judgement is Anastasia, a movie that I professionally dislike and personally despise. But an interesting one.This movie is a great example of why it never happened again. Here is one of the best movies of the year in a year that was filled with great movies, and yet it completely flopped at the box office due to legitimately horrible management by Warner Bros. Seriously; this movie was not relatively expensive (though it looks the part), and it has a very marketable premise. How do you screw that up? That's not rhetorical; I'm confounded. Yes, I'm aware Warner has a history in animation. But that's mostly in television; they should leave movies to the experts.Wow that was long-winded. Thankfully, this movie is not; at only eighty-six minutes, it flies by. You often want it to stay longer; not because it does anything incorrect, but because you don't want it to leave you. This is the kind of film where, if I saw it at the cinema, I would stay during the credits and afterwards. I would stay until they forced me to get out; that's the sort of film it is.If the animation is not as well-funded as Disney's, it does not show it. There are ambitious scenes in this film, scenes that seem to be the lovechild of 70s Disney, 80s Ghibli, and 00s Pixar. You can't honestly say that Tarzan looks like it has more money poured into it than this movie. The motion is especially eye-catching. Speed is one of the hardest things to get right, really right in animation. And yet when it is done right, there is nothing on planet Earth that looks prettier.Miyazaki is the best at this; the first time I watched a scene in the third act of Porco Rosso, one where Porco flies his plane for one last long sequence over the land and to the sea, to meet his final challenge, my life was forever changed. I'm not exaggerating; those were some of the most invocative, most profound minutes of my life. But Bird clearly takes cues from, and shares interests with, Mr. Miyazaki. It does not surprise me that the two of them are friends. And of course, thanks to him helping bring Miyazaki's works over to the West, I'm glad they are.This is a movie that gets darker as it goes along, but it does it in a smart way, a sensible way. And a way that can still get a kid-friendly rating. When I first-watched this movie, the first thing I thought of was eighties Spielberg (though without some of the sappiness.) If this isn't already, (I don't know) it should be one of those films that is in everyone's house, along with Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story, Totoro, Finding Nemo, Kiki's Delivery Service, etc. Kids deserve to have this movie be a part of their childhood. If I have kids, I'm showing them this.And of course, it is a gift to us adults as well, whether or not we believe that we deserve it. After the first ten minutes, the transition from 2D to 3D, doesn't feel weird at all. Even more, it feels magical, like it were conjured out of some fantasy world that we only by chance get to see. The writing is stellar and shows a lot of that quick wit that would latter become a staple of his. You get a lot of great lines without the sense that they're trying too hard like you do in The Avengers.I wouldn't say the music is spectacular aside from a few pieces, but it does fit the tone of the film well. The same is true to some extent with the characters, who are my one grievance with the film. They feel too clich\u00e9 and used. The good acting, particularly from the stars, Connick and Aniston, helps, but overall, he doesn't play enough with the characters. That's the main reason this film isn't as good as The Incredibles and one of the reasons why it isn't as good as Ratatouille (which also could have used stronger characters (except Ego, who was brilliant) but it is not as big of a problem and the rest of the movie is ambient enough to cover for it). And it's the reason I would give this film a 4.5 out of 5.But that's just me comparing Bird to the ridiculously high standards he has set for himself with his era-defining work. I will go as far as to say this is the best American animated film of the late nineteen-nineties not including the Toy Story movies. Better than Hercules or Mulan or Hunchback. It's a whimsical film, it's arguably the essential 'Boy and His X' film, and it is a film with something to say. If this was made after 9/11, it would be the essential post-9/11 movie. The military are the villains and its clear they are acting out of misery instead of 'For the Evulz.' But above all this, I say that I look forward to watching it again. And I believe that's one of the endorsements I can give to a film.And remember: sentient robots are not guns.(P.S. This movie takes place in Bird's birth year, 1957)",

            "content": "Actually just today I finally watched this picture so I actually watched first The Incredibles and Ratatouille, of course both directed by Brad Bird too. I liked this one more than Ratatouille and probably as much as The Incredibles. It has a story based on the friendship and that story is pretty known, this time the background is great so that \"basic\" story works in a perfect way. Everything happens in 1957 and as you know everything turns around that Iron Giant (voice of Vin Diesel). The human protagonist is a kid, Hogarth Hughes (voice of Eli Marienthal), who is influenced by science fiction movies and comic book stories -and MAD magazine- and who is going to have the first real contact with the Iron Giant, when he was already the theme in the conversations of the people in the town. The mother of Hogarth (voice of Jennifer Aniston) is use to hear him talking about those stories so when he talks about an Iron Giant she is not very surprised. It is a story of friendship first so the robot is practically a little kid, a really unique one, since he is learning everything, showing enthusiasm on that but of course you can't just make your friend a giant robot who needs metal as food and thinks that he just can remove a train track any time he is hungry (look at the character who was on that train, he looks a little similar to Marty Scorsese!). That's a truly big problem and of course Hogarth will have some problems if his mom or any other person meet his new friend but of course he will find some good people that will understand the robot, of course once they are calm after the obvious shock for meeting the Iron Giant. Actually he will only meet one person and his name is Dean (voice of Harry Connick, Jr.) and he is a really cool character, the opposite of Kent Mansley (voice of Christopher McDonald) who is the classic investigator of a mysterious and ridiculous case that first is making fun of it but once he is affected in a direct way the robot will be no more a joke and it will be a true objective as a product of the paranoia. At this point the Iron Giant turns to be a King Kong and since I haven't meet a person who feels good by watching the end of Kong here nobody will be with the army and here our Giant turns to be a real amazing robot that by then has already the S on his chest - A really great character that delivers even really hilarious moments.The voices are simply good. Is easy to recognize the voice of Jennifer Aniston here but is not the voice of Vin Diesel. For me is still strange to see him in the cast. I really dislike his performances. Anyway, the animation is really terrific and in the end this is a magnificent picture with great and very likable characters. I promise you that your family will love it and with its story it won't be a surprise if your girlfriend cries near the end, believe me. In short, The Iron Giant is one of the best films of 1999.PS: reading some comments for this film I found specially one that gained my attention. On that comment one of the things against this film is that it is \"anti-gun\", \"anti-hunting\", etc. In my opinion you don't need s*** like guns. I loved this film!!!!!!",

I won't spoil any plot points, but trust me, the lessons are ones you'll want your kids to learn. The last portion of the movie does have some violence, but compared to the loud, flashy scenes of today's movies, it's nothing your kids haven't seen before. And the animation is regular 2-D style, which I believe is better for kids' brains and developing attention spans anyway. When I watch a cartoon, I like it to look drawn by a person, not by a computer.If you particularly want your children to be shielded from on screen violence, you can wait until your kids are a little older.

The opening where Hogarth goes on the roof to check the antenna and then into the woods with the flashlight has much more suspense, as it appears to be night in the Signature Edition. The glowing power station and the Iron Giant getting shocked by the wires has much more pop in the Signature Edition. Hogarth coming up the stairs with the TV lighting the stairwell when he goes to check on the noise upstairs while watching TV is another good example.This is a really exciting and touching movie which highlights the intolerance and prejudice of people. Humans are out to destroy what they don't understand, rather than reaching out. The animation is superb, especially, the showdown at the end of the movie. The film leaves us guessing what the robot actually is- is he an alien from outer space, or a military experiment? This is an intelligent kids movie which will have you thinking about it after it has finished. Children will identify with the appealing lead character, as he struggles to help his friend. there are some really funny sequences in the film too, like when Hogarth gives Kent chocolate laxatives when he starts asking too many questions, and when the robot hand comes detached and starts wondering around the place.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",

I finally went and saw it, and I am glad I did.Combining elements of stories like ET, BLADE RUNNER, and WARGAMES, it is a great parable about anti-violence. Set during the paranoia of the 50s, it shows how humanity creates humanity and how violence creates just more violence. It has a message for the 90s and for all time. I am glad to hear a movie be so bold as to tell us the truth -- guns kill, and none of us have to be guns. We can be people.The animation in the film is beautiful with rich colors and believable characterization -- unlike the over-done wide-eyed stereotypes we keep getting in the assembly line Disney cartoons recently. This is a real family film -- both the kids and the adults can enjoy it. And to top it off, we have a robot who becomes a Christ figure. GO SEE IT!",

It does have some appealing, an emotional plot and a good ending, but, for me, it stays at 8/10 because I feel I have seen this type of movie before. A kid that founds \"someone\" that is very unusual or big, no ones believes him. Then people discover that he does exist and are afraid can be harmful, so they decide to eliminate him. Then at the end, that creature confirms he is good and it's a happy ending. So it was very predictable for me, but it doesn't mean it was bad. Another thing is that it let me with some questions like, where does the robot come from? How does he understand so well English? But I think that the movie let that to the audience to think.\nI recommend this movie to a family with kids, you will enjoy it for sure!",

            "content": "Just watched this movie again on DVD with my 4- and 6-year-old boys. Truly this is a great movie for raising all sorts of moral, ethical, and religious issues with youngsters.Which leads me to the reason for this post:  To respond to the many viewers who are obviously concerned about the \"negative\" portrayal of guns as being \"heavyhanded\" or \"politically correct.\"Several of these viewers quite accurately point out that the depiction of guns is uniformly appropriate.  Guns *do* kill, after all, and no one should be shocked to see a hunting rifle used to kill a deer (the hunters themselves are not in the least negatively characterized) or military weapons used in combat (and again, the uniformed military - in contrast to Kent Mansley - are depicted quite positively and professionally).  Even Hogarth's numerous toy guns are given realistic treatment.Regardless of your position on hunting, gun ownership, foreign policy, or whatever, please don't miss the opportunity to use this movie to discuss these issues with your children in context.  The Iron Giant, after all, is himself a (the?) super-gun -- that's the whole point of the movie.  It's not the gun itself that's good or bad, but the use to which it's put.  Guns don't represent evil in the movie, they represent power.  And each one of us has in us the power to do great good or great harm, within our families, our workplaces, our communities, and so on.  Teach your child to recognize his or her own powers and understand that he or she has the freewill to choose how they are used.  Teach your child to be Superman.And of course, like other posters, you will find political and religious themes in the movie, or any number of other things.I'll say it again -- what a great movie for kids to see.  Please don't automatically conclude its message is simply \"anti-gun\" just because guns are depicted being used as intended.",

It displays Vin Disel's acting ability by making me love a character and nearly tear up at the end by saying very very few words. The music is incredible. All the characters are great and have traits, even if in few supply, that make you love them. The villain is a slimy toad and you really dislike him but despite this he is also an incredible character. The story is genius and the message of 'You are who you choose to be' behind it is amazing and moving. There are some gut wrenching jokes and just tear jerking scenes. Not one scene feels like a waste. Not one act feels dragged out or pointless. Bad: The proportion of Hogarth's neck is weird. It is not as suitable for families which some distressing scenes and not AS MUCH humour in it as say a standard Disney or Dreamworks movie.Best Part: The Final SacrificeMVP: Vin Deasel as The Iron Giant",

At the time of writing it is showing on Sky. It combines humour with drama, and deals with the problems experienced by young teenagers as situational euphemisms i.e. one actually expressed in the film compares the giant, a metal creature of gigantic proportions, as a little child lost within a supermarket. This complies with everything I've written.If you haven't seen this film, even if you are of late teenager years like me, you will love it. It have received a lot of skeptical looks when mentioning this to schoolfriends, but I don't really care. It's their loss.The only comment I have against the film is the ending. It seems out of place. Comparing it to the life support machine starting to bleep after some time is a possibility, but this is (in most cases) a good thing. I reckon that it is good that a child should see that all good things come to an end (like the film), and that nothing lives for ever, not even giant metal monsters. That doesn't stop me awarding it 10 out of 10 though.Great voice acting, though the movie is always introduced hyping Jennifer Aniston, as though she is a 'special guest \"appearance\"'. This is wrong - she is as good as the rest of the cast, no more. Why isn't Eli Marienthal higher in the cast list?",

As of writing this review the movie is ranked #235 in the top 250, I strongly agree with its placement among the best movies of all time, but strongly disagree why it's not within the top 100.

            "review_title": "An underrated animated gem from the late 90s",
            "content": "I fondly remember watching this when I was about 12 or 13 and like 'The Magic Sword: Quest for Camelot,' this is another animated film from my youth I had forgotten about for several years until the Nostalgia Critic reminded me of it by placing it at no. 6 in his 'Top 11 Underrated Classics,' which also included the likes of 'The Prince of Egypt' and 'Babe: Pig in the City' that I had also seen during my pre-teen years.So back to 'The Iron Giant.' The animation was mostly smooth but jarring in places and there seemed to be a continuity error with regard to Hogarth's eyes - in some shots they had pupils in others they didn't. Other than the jarring movements and alleged continuities, the Iron Giant blended with the 2D animation perfectly since he didn't look anything like a CGI character and I liked the black and white animated segments that were used for the televisions and the bombing protection public information film shown at Hogarth's school. The film, although animated, had some realistic elements such as the Iron Giant eating metal that stayed true to the Iron Man eating metal in the Ted Hughes book and reminded me of a task I did at primary school where we were put into pairs and had to create a menu for the Iron Man that included ingredients such as chicken wire and oil. There were also some realistic and effective uses of colour and lighting such as the camera pan from a sunset sky to an autumnal landscape and the pale blue lighting as Hogarth followed the Iron Giant to an electric substation. The incidental music was initially forgettable but I found it fitting to the story when I re-visited the film this evening. As for the story itself, I found it a creative spin on the Hughes book that had a mixture of funny, somewhat crude and touching moments; the funny ones including the squirrel running rampage around the diner; the crude ones including Hogarth pretending to suffer from constipation as he tries to push the Iron Giant's hand out of the bathroom window and later sprinkling 'Coco-Lax' onto Kent's drink; and the touching ones including Hogarth's ever- increasing friendship with the Iron Giant and teaching him about death being a part of life upon witnessing a deer having been shot (it's Bambi all over again albeit less powerful. The story also has some educational value, especially Hogarth teaching the Iron Giant about the human world around him and that killing people or animals is a bad thing. Moving on to the voice acting, Jennifer Aniston as Hogarth's mother Annie and Vin Diesel, who pulled off the Iron Giant's voice as well as Robby Benson did with the Beast's voice in 'Beauty and the Beast,' were the standouts but Harry Connick Jr. as Dean and Eli Marienthal as Hogarth also did a great job with their roles. The ending of the missile destroying the Iron Giant, a statue of him being unveiled in the park and his separate parts moving in Iceland is unforgettable and moving without being too sentimental. I can even remember calling the film's setting Roswell instead of Rockwell as corrected by my then-babysitter and it was thoughtful of the film makers to dedicate this film to the memory of Ted Hughes during the closing credits.To conclude, I originally gave this an 8/10 due to finding some scenes more memorable than others but I upgraded it to a 9 because I enjoyed watching this even more than I did when I was a pre-teen/teenager.",

Best of all, it's nice to see an animated film without distracting musical numbers (don't get me wrong, I like musicals as well as the next guy) because done wrong they will handicap a movie (Prince of Egypt comes to mind.  Also, I think it considerable courage to take an anti-violence stance and say something as radical as \"Guns kill people\" (the NRA won't be endorsing this film any time soon). This movie did not fail to deliver on any level and I will be seeing it again.Michael Eisner may want to cash in a few more of his options while they're still worth something, because if this is a preview of things to come from WB, there is a definite contender for the Disney crown.",

The government is suspicious, as usual, and wants to destroy the robot. Hogarth teaches the robot the truths and choices of using his powers for good rather than evil. What makes up this film is a very fun collection of humor and suspense. The humor is top-notch, from Hogarth saying grace and trying to hide the robot's missing hand at the same time to Hogarth's hyped-out experience after drinking espresso. It is also compelling and touching, as Hogarth and the giant must make choices and learn lessons throughout the film. What an enjoyable film.

The animators manage to make his thought process apparent with minimal dialog and you can really feel for his emotions when he is asked to perform a noble act (at the climax) in order to save mankind from a fate worse than death.There's an effective background score by Michael Kamen, without the songs that seem to irritate some devotees of animated films, and it moves briskly at a pleasing pace that should keep young and old riveted to the sometimes magical events.Briskly entertaining and well worth watching--among the best of the animated films based on pure fantasy.

Yet, this film stands by itself, as far as I am concerned, as the greatest Animated Film ever..This is written by someone who for more than 50 years has been a fan of animation, of all kinds, from the \" The Sprit Within\" to \"Beauty and the Beast\" to, \"Dumbo\", to \"Robots\", to Triplettes de Belleville, Les, to \"Ice Age; to \"What's Opera Doc\" to \"One Froggy Evening\" to \"Duck Amuck\" to the \"Dot and the Line.\" Yes, I have seen hundreds of animated films, short and long..Further, I am not the only one who has said this is the best..Read as many of the reviews as you can..there are at least 10 more (possibly 20) that say that this is the best Animatated film ever, some others say this is among the greatest films ever made. And, it is.Why, because of its tone, message, flow, ease of transition, almost as if you do not notice it. In the end, there is a message, which goes past most, and it took me 3 or 4 showings in the theater, for the light bulb in my head to go on, about what Brad Bird was really trying to say with this filmSnow White, may be considered by some to be better, only because it made others possible, but this is the finest, most sensitive, most dramatic, and the best Full Length Animated Film ever made. For those who read this, and if you haven't seen this, let it hypnotize you, as it did to me..and watch the last 15 minutes a few times...maybe you too will figure it out.......Many years after this was written, I have to add an interpretation of the very end of the film,\nthat I came to realize only after 4 or 5 viewings in the theater at the time of its release...Yes, I saw it many times, perhaps 7 at the original release because this film is a feel good movie with a great message about violence and war...\n.................But at the end....after the explosion, the Iron Giant has been destroyed,...for about ten to fifteen seconds you see the Iron Giant putting\nhimself back together....Yes, he was destroyed, but you have the Iron Giant's\nparts coming back together to live some more...A moment at the end, that many viewers miss. Yes, Iron saved the world from destruction, and died doing so, but at the very end as he puts himself back together and is living again ...(I think that scene takes place in some distant out of the way place)\nI got the feeling that the message of this movie is very deep and spiritual..\n...........................................................................................................................................\n....The Iron Giant is... resurrecting himself at the very end of the film....coming to life again....Just like a great teacher of peace was resurrected after he died on the cross...That the message of the ...Iron Giant... is exactly the same as that\nother teacher who died on the cross about 2000 years ago....No difference\nin the teaching of the two teachers and believers in peace and helping others through life's most difficult times....That is what I saw at the very end of this wonderful and inspiring film...And it took me at least 4 viewings of the film at the time of its release in the fall of 1999 to understand what the real deep meaning of the movie \"Iron Giant\" was all about...At least that is what I believe to this day that I am writing this in November 2020. The Iron Giant's message about peace, kindness, love and sacrifice is not new at all. Even if Iron Giant came from another world to tell us this message..That message had been told before by other great teachers and no doubt will be told again and again...And you know maybe that message needs to be told over and over again...Many humans on this planet Earth need to hear this message more than once around this time of the year..We need to hear this message again, and again and again because it is a great message for everyone to know, follow and believe in.\nStuart",

            "content": "With the story's setting in 1957, my best takeaway from the film was the nostalgia associated with the era's fascination with the threat of an atomic attack and it's attendant duck n' cover drills and underground shelters. The movie itself had the feel of one of those 1950's Warner Brothers cartoons and one of the principal characters, Dean the scrap metal guy, was even called a beatnik at one point. The kid Hogarth (I agree with Kent Mansley, who names their kid Hogarth?) enjoys Superman and sci-fi comic books and there's even a Maypo TV commercial thrown in for good measure. Yessiree, those were the good old days.What's not so 1950-ish though is the representation of a family with no male figurehead, that's a decidedly modern day construct that probably began some time during the Eighties and continues today with all sorts of dysfunctional families. There's also the ever present anti-gun sentiment presented throughout, both subliminal and overt. I was kind of enjoying the picture until the liberal propaganda took on a get in-your-face message the way it did. Not to mention the portrayal of the FBI guy as a villain, though I'm sure there are some agents who would be as gung-ho as Mansley. But chloroforming the kid was taking it a step too far.So with the competing forces at work here, I thought the picture just minimally passes the fun quotient. The Iron Giant itself had almost a creepy kind of ambience compared to most of the cutesy kind of characters you generally have in these animated features. At least he rises to the occasion to save the day for the citizens of Rockwell, that was a plus. But every time the Iron Giant ate something made of metal, and I know it's only a cartoon, I had to wonder - how does that work?",

The animation is indescribable, but I'm just going to say that it borders on indisputable timeless with its effects and how the 3D mixes in with the 2D. Each of the important characters are hilarious, menacing, or a combination, and even the recurring ones are more than just tolerable. And to think that in 1999, so many people ignored this masterpiece in favor of lesser animated movies of that year, such as Tarzan and Toy Story 2. If there is a non-Disney animated film that you must see before you die, this should very easily be the one.",

If it wasn't commies menacing us, it was aliens in Roswell, NM. Plus, it may seem like a joke now, but Duck and Cover didn't when annihilation could come any moment from The Bomb. Ordinarily I wouldn't watch an animated feature since I grew up thinking that meant cartoon. However, this edition was recommended, and I ended up thoroughly enjoying it. Strange how unreal characters quickly become real. Anyway, this film reminded me of a classic in my day called The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951). Except the gentlemanly Klaatu and the laser-eyed robot Gort, the two main alien visitors of Stood Still, are combined here into the single character of the Iron Giant. However, in both movies, the adversity to be overcome is a paranoid American defense establishment. That was a pretty darn touchy topic for a Cold War 1951. The moral here seems something like getting over our cultural hostility to The Other, whatever form that might take. Here, of course, it's a giant metal robot, whose goodness turns out to embody something eternal, as its parts survive destruction. All in all, the animated story amounts to a happy surprise and a compelling one even for a geezer like me.",

            "content": "The Iron Giant is an animated film directed by Brad Bird. It is about a giant alien robot who landed on earth from outer space in the year 1957 and seems to have gotten amnesia. He meets and befriends a young boy named Hogarth, who shows the robot how to be a good person. While doing so, he must keep the robot safe from the public and especially from the U.S. government who is trying to track down what crashed on the planet.I watched this movie at my local theater this week because it was only two dollars a seat and because I was very curious about this one and I left the theater very satisfied with my experience. I couldn't have liked this movie more if I tried. The critics don't lie with this one, it's a well-written, well-polished animated family masterpiece. It is something that both kids and adults can watch and enjoy wholeheartedly.Staring with the animation, it uses a combination of both traditional animation and computer animation. Almost everything in the movie is traditionally animated and then we have the robot who is, at all times, computer animated. Surprisingly, the animators manage to blend in the robot with its surroundings perfectly. The animation doesn't feel out of place with either the 3D or traditional animation, which is a pretty amazing sight to see.The overall feel to it felt out of the ordinary from what you would find in most modern animated movies outside of Disney and Pixar. I feel like a lot of other companies try too hard to make their animated movies part comedy nowadays. With this movie, there were some funny moments, but they didn't parade the movie entirely. Instead, they're replaced with emotionally swinging, powerful moments that give it a very mature feel. For a family movie, it is quite mature, it's one of those movies that's rated PG for a reason. It delves into some very sensitive topics that were and still are relevant to the movie's time period such as fear and prejudice as well as what could lie beyond our world. To further that it's a more mature film, it does have some adult humor and language.I liked all the characters in the movie. I liked the simple, quirky and lonely boy that was Hogarth. Kent was a menacing, unsettling villain who always kept his watchful eye on the main character as two examples. My favorite character of them all has to be the titular character. He's a simple, yet deep and complex character. I won't go too in-dept on him since it would go into spoiler territory, but we do find out about his complexity much later which changes the mood of the movie.Going blindly into this movie was a decision that I do not regret. The Iron Giant is a must watch for anyone who loves animated, movies or just wants a good movie experience. I don't think I found a single flaw or con with this movie when I watched it, it was an experience that I won't forget.10/10",

            "content": "Before The Incredibles and MI: Ghost Protocol, Brad Bird directed this delightful animated feature for Warner Bros about a kid who bonds with a giant robot he finds in the woods outside of his home town. The giant robot seems to be from outer space, feeds on metal, and will not shoot unless provoked or defending itself. And the robot seems to have artificial intelligence that allows it to evolve, learn, and feel. Insidious government agent (voiced by Christopher MacDonald; who better, right?) sets his sights on the robot and wants the military to obliterate it, convincing military general (John Mahoney of Frasier fame) to assist in firing upon it, which puts the boy, Hogard (voiced by Eli Marienthal), in jeopardy. Hogard's harried, single mother is voiced by Jennifer Aniston and the Iron Giant is beautifully voiced by Vin Diesel. Harry Connick, Jr. voices junk metal artist, Dean, who also bonds with Hogard and provides refuge for the Iron Giant at his junkyard. The Iron Giant is a feast for the eyes of fans of comic book robots from the old school. Terrific animation in a very Ray Bradbury-esque small town, including some damn strong storytelling revolving around a boy and a robot that find a friendship full of wonder and awe, caught the attention of critics; this was just a sample of Bird's gifts. The disembodied robot hand following Hogard around in his house while MacDonald's Kent Mansley finds him suspicious and tries to snoop on his activities is a knockout! Best scene could be when Hogard first meets the giant as he rips into power lines and metal structures for nourishment. Also dazzling is a scene involving train tracks as Hogard pleads with the giant to repair it as a locomotive approaches. The way Bird lights the Iron Giant as distantly sinister only to convince us of how harmless he looks and acts when up close speaks about how we should wait before assuming something is dangerous until the evidence presents itself. The ending which has various body parts trying to find themselves in a return to a whole and the Iron Giant sacrificing itself for Hogard makes the heart sing. A special treat. Just wonderful. Cloris Leachman, James Gammon, and M. Emmet Walsh also contribute voices to members of the town.",

I figured with an animation with a name like \"Iron Giant\" I was safe from such a tale, but was this going to be any good?The iron giant crash landed somewhere off the coast of Maine. He was seen by the town drunk and then by a little boy named Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal). Hogarth fearfully befriended the robot that liked to snack on all things metal. Actively seeking this extraterrestrial giant was a government man named Kent (Christopher McDonald). It was evident that if Kent found the big bot he was not going to treat him nicely. Hogarth, to his credit, intuitively knew to keep the giant hidden for his own sake.Eventually, Kent found the metal mammoth and brought the army down on it with its full weight. I guess I should've mentioned that the year was 1957, Russia just launched the Sputnik, we were deeply entrenched in the Cold War, and fallout drills were a regular thing. So, a 10-story mobile machine could quickly and easily be interpreted as a WMD to bring America to her knees. Therefore, even though Kent was overly eager to destroy the iron giant, it didn't take much urging for the Army to feel likewise.Is it OK to say I was moved by this movie? It wasn't just the friendship between Hogarth and the alien because I'd seen that in \"E.T.\" The fact that this alien creature sacrificed himself to save a small town was heart-rending. He was such a stark contrast to the selfish, cowardly, and duplicitous Kent that his sacrifice was made that much more heroic and reverential. The iron giant had giant heart.",

Aside from this their efforts have been somewhat useless. Content for a long time to release other peoples animated movies such as [Thumbelina] and [The Pebble and the Penguin] (go on, have you seen them?) they decided, on the strength of [Space Jam]'s success, to reopen their famous theatrical animation department in the hope that they could recreate the legendary success of their 50's short cartoons with full-length animated features. Their first effort, [The Magic Sword: Quest for Camelot], boasted as many words in the title as there were famous names in the voice cast but, sadly, boasted almost nothing else. Except that there were almost as many words in the title as there were people who went to the cinema to see it. So, it is somewhat of a surprise to find Warner Brother's Feature Animation department releasing this upon an unsuspecting movie world, for this is the finest animated feature-length film to be released that has nothing to do with the mighty Disney studios (as of February 2000 and, it should be noted, that the key animators on this movie are all ex-Disney). Forget DreamWorks' glossy but botched [Prince of Egypt], forget Steven Spielberg's over-rated executive-produced [An American Tail], forget the excellent [Antz], forget even [Toy Story] and [Toy Story 2] (both co-financed and released by Disney anyway). The Iron Giant is cinema's finest non-Disney animated feature length film. It is a real shame that so few people saw it. Here's hoping that the home video market will discover this real gem.",

In this case the supernatural character has a heart. Premise is one of those boy meets robot themes where a giant robot falls to earth and is befriended by a boy but a government agent wishes to destroy it. To prevent that from happening the boy seeks help from a junk yard owner named Dean. The giant feeds on metal so the location would be perfect for hiding. Flourishing and heart warming with directing by Brad Bird. Voice talents include Harry Connick Jr. as the voice of Dean who finds art within the ugly. We know where he ends up but the character is unique in his point of view. Unfortunately Jennifer Aniston as the boy's mother who is too busy for her son, is never interesting. Christopher McDonald as the agent villain bypasses formula with hilarious pratfalls. Vin Diesel voices the gentle Iron Giant himself who goes through predictable friendship elements before a great climatic sacrifice that ends with a wink. Finally Eli Marienthal voices the curious boy who accepts and befriends this robotic companion. Strong theme regarding friendship and heroism that should be great lessons for the target audience.

The storyline follows a young boy on the coast of Maine who one day thinks he saw a shooting star; but upon exploring where the star landed he discovers he has seen much more...he has found a robot from outer space. He will do his best to make friends with the robot and teach him the ways of Earth. Meanwhile, the robot eats metal things to survive and the more he eats the more at risk he is of being caught. If someone discovers the robot its life, and the boy's life, may be at risk.This movie is directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles) and contains the voices of Vin Diesel (The Fast & Furious), Jennifer Aniston (FRIENDS), Cloris Leachman (Young Frankenstein), Christopher McDonald (Happy Gilmore), M. Emmet Walsh (Blade Runners) and John Mahoney (Moonstruck).This picture has a lot of the cool science fiction elements that will be a big hit to fans of the 1950s era space movies. I loved how those elements were spun into the unique storyline. The robot was awesome and it is easy to root for the kid and robot. There's a swimming scene in this that's awesome and always makes me smile. The animation is very mediocre compared to other gems released during this era, but the storyline makes up for it. The ending is triumphant and grabs your heart.Overall, this is a unique and worthwhile addition to the family animated genre and an absolute must see. I would score this a 7.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",

            "content": "Don't get me wrong, I did really enjoy this film, but it is also a good example of why I think American animation is far inferior to Japanese animation. And I am talking solely about the animation (i.e., character design, movement, and scenery), not the story complexity. There is no doubt that the stories of Japanese animated films are more complex than those of American animated films. The Iron Giant's story is basically taken straight from E.T.Anyhow, watch how mannered the designs of the characters' faces are in this film. Check out how large Hogarth's ears are. And check out how exaggerated the characters' movements are. This becomes staggeringly unrealistic very quickly. It begins to look, well, just plain goofy. People don't really look like this. They don't make these sorts of expressions.People always complain about the eye size of Japanese anime characters. Their eyes are big for a simple reason which was stated in ancient Rome by the neo-Platonist philosopher Plotinus: the eyes are the windows of the soul. The sculptors of the later Roman Empire always made the eyes on statues enormous, just like the Japanese animators do. Most human expression comes from the eyes, so Japanese animators made the eyes on their characters bigger.What most critics of the Japanese anime eye-size have failed to notice is how large the American animators have made the eyes on their characters. The Americans are obviously learning something from the Japanese. Disney animators have said that there is not a work day that goes by where they do not watch parts of films by Hayao Miyazaki. These films have influenced them greatly. But what American animators have missed in the Japanese animation is that the other pieces of their characters' faces are extremely downplayed. Their mouths, ears, and nose are all very small. Humans express much less in these areas of their faces than the characters of American animated films. This over-exaggeration has occurred in all Disney movies after The Little Mermaid, The Iron Giant, The Road to El Dorado, and I can even see that this is a problem in the upcoming animated flick Titan A.E. It is a big problem, and it must be solved.As for the film itself, after I got around those technicalities, I was quite touched. I liked the anti-violence theme a lot. I think it is a very good film for children. I give it an 8/10.",

            "content": "'The Iron Giant (1999)' focuses on the friendship between a young boy and a giant machine after the latter crash-lands near the former's small town. Arriving from an unknown place at a time filled with post-war fear means that most people immediately fear the giant, even though he's as friendly as can be thanks to a bump on the noggin and a heavy dose of electricity. It isn't just his initial trauma that keeps him kind, though; it's the teachings of our protagonist, who firmly instils a sense of self in the being and tells him that killing is wrong. The first half of the flick is basically about the blossoming relationship between its two leads, which is charming and well-paced. The second introduces some resonant themes - regarding choice, discrimination and, even, what it means to have a soul - and brings its antagonist, a selfish and nationalistic government agent, further to the forefront. This all builds to an effective finale that successfully pushes the movie's message of tolerance and the ability to choose who you are. Its final emotional punch really is as impactful as its reputation would have you believe. In general, the film doesn't seem as though it panders to kids at all; it tells a relatively grown-up story that should appeal to all members of the family. It's a beautifully animated adventure with a giant heart at its core. 7/10.",

Say one thing for \"The Iron Giant\":  if you have to model your tale on an earlier film, you could do a lot worse than Steven Spielberg's timeless masterpiece, \"E.T. - the Extraterrestrial.\"  The good news too is that, derivative as this new film is - it plays at times almost like a scene-by-scene remake of the previous film, - \"The Iron Giant\" is quite a charmer in its own right as well.  It is a rare pleasure to see an animated film so rooted in the real world.  So many of them take us to such exotic places - for the obvious reason that animated films, by their very nature simply CAN, - that all too often we feel distanced from what is taking place on the screen before us.  By setting this film in the recognizable world of 1950's America, the makers establish a tone of unfrenetic charm and tranquility that plays well as a background for the sci-fi elements of the tale.  The film also becomes a beautiful reflection on the strange coexistence of scientific idealism and trepidation that took hold of the imagination in that early era of space exploration and nuclear gamesmanship - an uneasy amalgam that found its way into many of the science fiction films of the time.The dialogue in the film enhances the gentle tone of the story without resorting to either maudlin sentimentalilty or sardonic cynicism. Hogarth, the boy, is simply a curious, well intentioned young lad, a bit smarter than most perhaps but not a budding genius (one of the wittiest lines comes when he bemoans the fact that other boys tease him because he is so much smarter than them when really the only difference is that he STUDIES).  \"The Iron Giant\" manages to instill a number of such subtle life lessons as these without straining the point or becoming pedantic about it - although the \"guns kill\" theme, obviously designed to infuriate NRA members, does come across as a bit heavyhanded.The use of widescreen yields a number of tremendously beautiful moments of visual splendour, and the giant himself is especially impressive.  Again, though, the animation is always placed at the service of the material;  we are not subjected to a barrage of meaningless flashy images for their own sweet sake.  \"The Iron Giant\" may feel overly familiar - and it will never replace \"E.T.\" as the definitive version of this story - but it is definitely a film well worth seeing, an animated film that will indeed appeal to audiences of all ages.",

The Iron Giant manages to do both it's aims extremely well: be an entertaining kids film,and be an intelligent piece of post cold war propaganda,almost on a par with The Day The Earth Stood Still.It's this film with more humour,and more social observation.The robot definitely steals the show,though:the effects,it's unintentionally misfiring attempts to mimic Hogarth,and it's sad ending all contribute greatly to making The Iron Giant the splendid film it is.Highly recommended.****",

Whereas the original novel was a poetic and lyrical fairytale that read like modern mythology, Brad Bird's movie is a straight up sci-fi movie in the vein of 'E.T.' Set during the era of the Soviet launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957 and the ensuing Cold War panic, the whole thing looks like the kind of movie that Disney used to make at the time, all beautifully painted backdrops and hand-drawn characters. The evocation of the era is very well done, with a careful and detailed eye for period ephemera and styling. It's a gentle and affectionate movie with a distinct lack of the knowing, adult-oriented, pop-culture referencing attitude of most recent animation. But this back-to-basics approach, while refreshing, seems a little too simple, too na\u00efve, and too superficial. It's a good movie, and one I would encourage children to see, but a lot of rich potential was sorely missed.",

However, he gets electrocuted. A young boy, Hogarth Hughes, who went into the woods after seeing strange lights, saves the robot by turning off the power.As a result, the robot follows Hogarth. Hogarth teaches the robot to talk, and they become inseparable friends. It is a beautiful story of a most unusual friendship, but I still felt the film lacked a driving force. It was fun seeing Hogarth and the robot together, and it was absolutely hilarious when Hogarth tried to hide to robot from his mother in their home.The film's antagonist is Mansley - a government agent who wants to destroy the robot. Being an animated movie, I expected it to be cartoonish at times, but luckily it never was, nor was it slapstick. 'The Iron Giant' is actually a very special little film with a message of friendship.

Actually, creator Brad Bird did in fact go on to work for Disney (or more specifically Pixar), but it's still a Warner Bros. movie. It's great to have this little gem around and I'm so glad that it seems to be getting more popular all the time. Originally, it was thought to be obscure, but now it's praised for being the great film that it is. I admit that there are some things that could have been done better. We never do find out where the Iron Giant came from.I guess the implication is that he was from another planet. Was he supposed to be used as a weapon by aliens invading Earth? If so, that means things are going to get a lot worse now. I do believe it's said he's from a planet already destroyed or something. What I love about this film is the pacing. Nothing feels rushed. It's hard to do that with a movie less than 90 minutes long. It's a little clich\u00e9d at times, but it's still a great movie. The plot is fairly simple. It's about a robot that crash lands on Earth and befriends a little boy. I guess it's like ET only with a giant robot.The best part of this movie is easily at the end. It's when the Giant sacrifices himself to stop a missile from blowing up a town. I certainly felt chills when I saw that. I was thinking it would end when the military showed up, but I still got the big climax at the end. We even get a setup for a sequel, more or less as we actually see the Giant having his parts come back together at the very end. I guess it's all open to interpretation what happens next. By the way, the idea of his body parts coming back together is freaking amazing. We get characters that act like real people. I also love the 1950's setting. It's as good as people make it out to be. ***1/2",

Simply, about five years before \"The Incredibles,\" was made, Brad Bird was attached to direct one of the most underrated movies of all time, The Iron Giant. I gotta say, I only watched this twice and even though I know what happens the second time, it is still heartwarming and Brad Bird's best. Let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will appear as an event in the movie.Our main characters are The Iron Giant (Vin Diesel) and Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal). The relationships in this film are amazing and subtle. They aren't shoving it in your face they just play it naturally and the relationship between these two is no exception. They're both fun characters and The Iron Giant gets his funny moments too. The main villain is probably Kent Mansley(Christopher McDonald). He's just annoying and a jerk but that's what makes him such an awesome villain-ish. He's obsessed with destroying the Giant that he forces Hogarth to tell him where it is and if he doesn't cooperate, he's gonna take him away from his mother! ... YOU SICK TWISTED *******! The supporting characters are, Hogarth's mom, Annie Hughes (Jennifer Aniston) and Dean McCoppin(Harry Connick Jr.). Once again, the relationships here are very subtle and the cross relationships of Hogarth to his mom, Dean, Kent, and the giant are amazing (and all that that implies lol). The action in here is amazing, especially near the last part. Kent gets the AIRFORCE to strike at one giant. Once again, forgive me for this... YOU SICK TWISTED *******! Now the story is simple. A robot crashes on Earth and a kid befriends it. The kid tries to prevent anyone seeing him but A SICK TWISTED *******! ... sorry tries to find out about the robot and tries to get the army to destroy it. Well, this is on my top movies list and I'm proud to give The Iron Giant, 88% awesome!",

We also watch the government trying to destroy the giant robot and what the two friends are doing in order to protect themselves.I liked this animation movie because it shows the true meaning of friendship with many beautiful moments. The direction which was made by Brad Bird was very good and he presented very well how friendship would be no matter the differences of each other. He also presented what people can do if they are united and support each other.

            "content": "Plot:The entire set-up of being placed in the 1950's was a work of genius. They didn't go for the stereotypical look, but actually tried to make accurate without shoving it in your face. I'll talk more about this in the visuals. The plot starts with a giant robot crash landing onto earth. His origins are unknown and aren't important to the movie, which is fine by me. He encounters a boy named Hogarth Hughes. They become friends over-time and soon go through challenges that are caused by paranoia and military suspicion. It's great stuff (And it all makes sense).Characters:Hogarth is a very likable and funny pre-teen that has a unique personality. He's described soulfully through dialogue and not directly to the audience. We find out, just as a side trait, that he keeps pets that he finds out in the wild. In the diner his mother works in, they have a minor but funny conversation about the previous pets he's brought in. Speaking of which, his voice and tone he keeps the whole film work nicely; his outbursts aren't whiny, annoying, or irritating. I can't think of another child character in a movie done as well as Hogarth. He's also very clever when it comes to finding ways around obstacles. It's a little hard to describe without going on forever, but his actions, motivations, and lines spoken are... well, just great.The Giant is a character in itself. He's come down to earth for... some mission. But due to a bump on his head, he has amnesia. So, Hogarth takes the chance to teach him and make the robot good-natured. It's a delightful story between the two characters. I wouldn't have minded if there was no action in the movie and just focused on those two. Vin Diesel is great as the Iron Giant, just saying.Oh, and the side-character Dean is the highlight of the movie... I guess?Visuals:As I already stated, the 50's look of this environment is fantastic. There's a scene that takes place after the Giant and Hogarth encounter for the first time where Hogarth is in a classroom. He's busy drawing the Giant in his notebook and arguing with other students. In the background playing on a projector is an Atomic Holocaust Safety Video. Considering it's the 1950's during the Cold War and after World War II, this is a great subtle throw-back to the time period. The people in the diner I already talked about are dressed perfectly for the period. Dean, for some reason, looks like a Greaser, while all the waitresses and waiters wear the correct attire. In a later scene, Hogarth is watching a Black & White Science-fiction horror film (Involving Brains) and eating Twinkies. What's cool is the packaging on the Twinkies is made to look old-school; it's great.Sound:Much like how the sounds the Speeder-bikes from Star Wars made lingered in my minds (And I'm sure a lot of other peoples' minds), the footstep sounds the Giant creates are so memorable. I don't know what it is about them, but I can never get them out of my head. It's part of my collective memory now. The voice of the giant is also memorable. I don't know if it's because of Vin Diesel or the editing process, but the robotic voice the Giant gives is something that might give you an eargasm. It's just absolutely crazy how cool his voice sounds.Of course, the one of the bigger reasons this criteria gets a five star is the musical soundtrack. It's one of the best scores I've ever heard. Right up there with some of John Williams' work. I'm not kidding.Enjoyment:Every time I went to my neighbors' house to be babysat, I watched this movie. I must've watched this film over thirty times. I've honestly lost track, and yet, it still doesn't get old. I loved this film as a kid and I love it now. I can't say much else but, GO WATCH IT!",

            "content": "The Iron Giant (1999) :\nBrief Review -Brad Bird gives an extra push to the evergreen stories of King Kong and ET with his mechanical-animated-classic. Mercin Cooper's timeless classic \"King Kong\" (1933) and Steven Spielberg's groundbreaking classic \"ET: The Extra Terrestrial\" (1982), have been loved by the critics, audiences and even kids. We know the basic stories of these two films: a monster/creature arrives in human society and then humans try to beat him up, despite the monster/creature being harmless. King's tale had a girl factor, ET had a kid factor (along with his family and friends), and even Brad Bird's Giant Iron Man story has a kid again, along with his mother and an adult companion. Just like in those two stories, we have a creature here who enters human society, becomes friends with the kid, and then the defence system tries to attack him for no apparent reason. But there is an emotional boost in the climax, which is quite an intelligent mix of Kong and ET's endings. As we know, Kong dies and ET leaves, and here we have a sort of mix in The Iron Giant. Bird actually plays a smart trick of having a happy ending just after the sad one, which leaves us emotional, especially the kids. It was for the sequel. Yes, I get that. \"You are what you choose to be. You don't have to be a gun. Gun kills,\" says Hogarth. That was some quote for a small kid, no? I also loved the aggressive factors shown by the writers that the robot is ready to destroy the one who harms him. He is not too soft like the regular protagonists we see in such stories. The human belt is terrified to see it, and that's what shows us our lameness. The voice cast is fine, and so are the visual effects. Overall, a superb adaptation of timeless tales with a beautiful machinery touch to it. Much much better than your popular \"Iron Man\" from the Marvel Cinematic universe.RATING - 7.5/10*",

The soundtrack is also a treat, with the first half of the movie filled with classic 1950's radio hits, and the last half with menacing sci fi thriller tones that leave you on the edge of your seat.The movie is full of fun developments, like when the child-like giant robot begins to see itself as a copy of Superman after Hogarth reads it comic books in the barn. The robot's true nature however soon becomes apparent when it witnesses hunters shoot and kill a deer, and the automatic programming registers the human guns as a threat.Harry Connic turns in a fantastic performance as the beatnik junkyard collector and artist Dean, and Jennifer Anniston does a fantastic job as Hogarth's overworked but ever doting young mother.",

Nearly twenty years later as I enter adulthood, I view this film completely differently. A story about loneliness, a young boy confiding in the titular character in a bid to teach him his ideologies of anti-warfare. A governmental agency concerned for the welfare and security of their own country, viewing the giant as a weapon from another nation. I cannot emphasise enough how rare it is to find such a multi-dimensional family animation that tells a different story dependent on your own perspective. Bird's directorial debut is a statement and certainly a landmark in the animation genre, garnering a cult status where the giant is often the centre of several pop cultural references ('Ready Player One' anyone?). The steampunk aesthetic appeal, CGI on top of hand-drawn animation and surprisingly dark themes has resulted in a flick that has aged impeccably well. Incredibly minimalistic in its storytelling, particularly the deer death scene, yet utterly powerful. The characters themselves were brimming with personality, from the mischievous boy to his worrying mother, they all brought the pictures to life accompanied by an intelligent screenplay. Voice acting was pretty special also, boasting an A-List cast including Aniston and the deep sounds of Diesel. The pacing was pretty much perfect, quickest hour and a half you'll experience. Let's talk about that heartbreaking ending...perfection. It took everything that the film symbolised and placed them all into one powerful scene. Everything from the themes, metaphors and ideologies. Boom. That scene. It defines the film. Whilst I would've preferred they removed the final minute, it is a family film so I'll let it slide. What I can confidently say is that The Iron Giant is a timeless thematic classic that hasn't shown any signs of rust just yet. One of the most impressive directorial debuts.",

The film's score is fantastic too. The animation is amazing, the voice acting is brilliant. And I'm a sucker for a film set in the 50s. If I have to pick one thing I didn't like, it was the reinstated dream sequence for the signature edition, where we scenes of his home world.

The story is simple, yet says so much about people and fear of those things that are different.  The film, however, is just not for children, it is for adults as well.  It breathes nostalgia of a time when the life of a child was full of science fiction films of the fifties, great comic books like Superman, and the seeming impending doom of the atomic bomb.  This film is exquisitely animated in an animation we seldom see anymore.  The characters are richly drawn and the voice-overs are perfect in both timing and choice of artists.  There is also a gentle, sometime low-brow humour throughout the film that helps bring back the memory of what is was like to be a child.

When I saw this movie, I did not know anything about it and I didn't expect much from it, and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The story involves a young boy who discovers a crash landed (?) robotic giant in the woods near his home, where he lives with his single mother. Despite the predictable ending and the rather unoriginal story (\"Cool, my own Terminator!\"), The Iron Giant is a heartwarming tale of friendship and family that provides excellent entertainment for all ages. It is unlikely that the giant is able to learn so much about humans (emotions, soul, acceptance, life, etc), but that's beside the point. I mean, they never even hinted as to where the giant came from, who made him, or why he was endowed with such jaw-dropping artillery. Is he some sort of alien Bicentennial Man? Even though the giant's entire background is left a mystery, the film is still able to tell a wonderful story. Let's just hope they make a sequel in which the giant's home is portrayed more.The cast was also excellent. In particular I enjoyed Harry Connick Jr.'s performance as the endlessly tolerant Dean McCoppin, and most of all, ironically enough, Christopher McDonald as the government agent Kent Mansley. Christopher McDonald almost always plays a jerk of some sort in all of his movies (Happy Gilmore, Dirty Work, and SLC Punk, to name a few), and he was endlessly amusing in The Iron Giant (\"...no, Bob, big things happen in big places. And the sooner I fill out my report, the sooner I can get back to them.\"). Great stuff.The Iron Giant is a movie for all tastes. I strongly believe that anyone who didn't like this movie did not give it a fair enough chance, because it was just so well done. It is one of those rare films (especially animated) that has an ending that virtually forces you to smile. You can't walk away from this movie unhappy, it is touching, it's fascinating, it's entertaining, and it should not be missed.",

            "content": "Scrolling through the comments for \"The Iron Giant,\" I found so much praise for this simple, beautiful film that it seems unnecessary to add another glowing review. So why am I writing one anyway? Because it's the kind of special movie you feel compelled to rave about, no matter how many others have already done so.What Disney has done to animated film the past decade is evil. They've churned out increasingly soulless, formulaic movies that exist solely to bleed every last penny from parents. They take their children to the theater, pick up cheap tie-in toys at the fast food joint, trek to the toy store for more shoddy ancillary crap, and buy the video so their little drones can sledgehammer the pointless sludge that Disney has to gall to call entertainment into their skulls by watching it 72 times. (Not that it bugs me or anything.)Thankfully, \"The Iron Giant\" is the complete opposite of all this. A quiet, touching film filled with delights both large and small, its heart is as big as its brain. It's got a gentle, thoughtful essence that most movies of any kind simply lack.I am late 20s with no kids, and rather cynical (if the Disney rant didn't clue you in). I watched this film with my wife, and we both melted. If you have kids, this is a must-see. Even if you don't, I still recommend it. It's clever, well-written, thought-provoking, and it will resonate with anyone who has a sense of humor and empathy. Give this film 90 minutes and it will give you reason to believe that there are still people who use animation to make something special, not just make a profit.",

            "content": "In his directorial debut, Brad Bird ends up delivering a heartwarming adventure film easily on par with the best Disney has ever produced. Not surprisingly he joined Pixar right after this. The Iron Giant is a deceptively simple tale of a boy and his giant space robot friend, but once again it's the execution that's more important than the idea itself.Because this film has layers. For one thing, it's a pure and honest love letter to mid-century nostalgia. Think Steven Spielberg on steroids. Everything from the visuals to the character archetypes evoke that era, and it does so beautifully. Honestly one of my favourite pulp films ever made. Even though technically this takes place in the Cold War period, and thus isn't really a pulp film, but it has the same aesthetic and feel. If you can watch a movie and immediately think of Indiana Jones, then it's a pulp film, at least a little bit.For another, the characters are amazing. From Hogarth and his child-like wisdom and believe in the concept of rightness to the shady government agent Kent Mansley, who's one of those villains you love to hate, but who you also kind of get in some weird manner. Not to even mention the Giant itself, who's simply great. It's like you gave a bloodthirsty grizzly the soul of a puppy and then made him look adorable and badass at the same time. And the fact that he is entirely CGI yet blended in with the rest of the animation so well that I didn't even notice, is mind-blowing.Pretty much the only thing that I can gripe about is the story. Or rather the fact that this is one of those rare films where the complaint is that it is too short. There seems to be a scene or two missing between the second and the third act, rhythm-wise, but that is explained by the fact that Bird and his team operated on a minuscule budget and under strict time restraints.And frankly, if your only complaint about a movie is that it is too short, then you know you've watched something pretty special. The Iron Giant failed at the box office upon its release because it was barely marketed at all, but luckily more and more people have found it over the years. Do yourself a favour and give it a watch.",

            "content": "This movie is set in an era when the Soviet Union was seen as the evil empire, the greatest threat to our way of life.  But at the same time, our government's efforts to stop communism made it an enemy to anyone who seemed the least bit sympathetic to the Soviets or other horrible outside forces. In fact, we now know the Russians were probably no more evil than we were. And that was the case with the alien monster who landed in this world, in a small coastal community.  People saw the UFO, and it was reported to the feds. The government sent a bumbling agent with all the personality of a Las Vegas lounge singer, who could comically fake sincerity and a helpful attitude, or sternly remind uncooperative adversaries just who they were dealing with.  The one witness who actually saw the monster, a young boy, saved the monster as it tried to eat electrical transmission towers and a substation.  He did something a child should never do:  walked into the substation and turned off the power.  From there he and the monster became friends, and he received help from a beatnik junk dealer/artist who also became a potential romantic interest for the boy's single mother. Naturally, the boy has a hard time convincing people that what he saw was real, and when the federal agent shows up, he tries to cover up what he knows.  It's a nice story with lots of trivia that requires paying close attention, and the animation is incredibly detailed.  Spoilers follow:  The townspeople want to destroy the monster once they find out about him, and when conventional weapons do not work, the military tries a nuclear solution.  In this way, the movie parallels our real experience with the Russians:  if we used a nuclear weapon, we could end up destroying ourselves.  To their horror, the townspeople learned that by killing the monster, they would kill themselves and do away with their town.  It would have been too late, except for one final heroic act by the monster.  MAJOR SPOILER:  Or was it the monster's final act?  Despite the bomb's being nuclear, we see a hint early in the movie of just how there could be a truly happy ending.",

Why is it there?I said it's a fine STORY; as far as the telling of it goes, something is lacking.  I'm not sure animation was the right medium for it.  It's fashionable to decry Disney's reliance on such things as fairytales, fantasy, anthropomorphic animals and musical numbers - but these, after all, are the kind of thing that can indisputably be done WELL with animation, and there's nothing wrong, surely, with making sure that form matches content. But animated science fiction like \"The Iron Giant\" never quite works.  (No, not even when it's done by the Japanese.)The giant itself is a masterpiece: the precise angles of every spring and hydraulic chamber have been calculated by a computer, then outlined so as to match the hand-drawn characters ... indeed, I get the feeling that the giant could not have been portrayed any other way, which, I'm afraid, means that the film was doomed, since when the humans are drawn and animated and characterised so as to match him, they don't have any life.It's a noble, honest attempt (apart from the ending), pleasing to look at and certainly worth seeing.  The extravagant praise heaped upon the film at the time of its release is probably due to the fact that it HAD just been released, and people hadn't had time to forget it.

            "content": "This is a movie especially for boys. As a kid, it's just fine to have friends your own age, but younger kids know that hanging out with cooler, older teens is what you really want. The last thing my teen brother wanted was a kid pestering him. But I did have an older cousin who hung around with me one summer. That was a great summer. Here Dean McCoppin (Harry Connick Jr) is the human friend that hangs out with adolescent Hogarth, much as Connick did in Little Man Tate. Already that's a fine idea for a movie. As in other Brad Bird movies, the value of friendship is the whole show here. I'm completely open to that message. But bigger than any big brother, is the 100 foot tall Robot. Before there was Michael Bay's Transformers, there was this giant, retro, CGI robot. The giant is a simple soul who is perfectly sweet until hidden wires are tripped. The giant doesn't even learn why he does it, much as in human personalities. To say any more would be to crush this movies slight story.When I first saw this, I liked a lot of it but had some minor qualms about the ending. I really wish there was a moratorium on bombs launched in the final ten minutes of a movie (for the next 20 years). Fresh endings would then have to be devised. I really wanted this imaginative movie to also be as clever in it's major conflict and resolution as it had been everywhere else. I still like it, but it seems like the middle is lacking stronger scenes. As it turns out, scenes were cut from the film. I thought I'd never say this about a film, but it really craves a one minute montage showing some silly moments where the robot-Hogarth friendship intensifies.The smooth-moving CGI robot is inserted into more typical animation. Animators know that any object without a hard outline is difficult to animate conventionally, and so they take advantage of the CGI to make the giant's eyes two big hazy, expressive floodlights. All the voice talent provides good work, which results in the closest I've seen to acting in an animated movie. But even the largely silent giant has very nicely-observed behavior that contributes to his character. Disney's much more conventional attempts to get 2-D characters to act have been downright awful and d.o.a. (Hunchback, Pochahontas). The \"be whoever you want to be\" message here, while a clich\u00e9, is such a soft-sell that a single word (\"Superman...\") at a pivotal moment, may make your eyes well up. It's really nice to see an animated movie that hasn't been overcapitalized and upsold like Disney's cynical 90-minute product launches; and one without their self-inflated need for instant classics; an urge that neuters any decision that might result in a unique or creative moment. This movie also spares audiences the obnoxious post-Genie hyperactivity and movie-ruining--freneticism that has made other Disney movies after Aladdin obnoxious and desperate (Hercules, Tarzan). I'm not a big fan of Bird's Disney work, though Monsters Inc (friendship again!) was very nice.I'm glad I re-rented this.",

The theme this film used has been done many times in movie history, but it is still a worth while and entertaining version.

            "content": "An enjoyable and inspiring animated film for all ages. This modern fairytale is a story of a great friendship - that of a lively yet warm-hearted boy and a 50 foot iron robot with some very human qualities.In 1950s America, post-war suspicion and paranoia give rise to a fear of all things different. A huge robot from outer space is seen as the ultimate threat. Yet one perceptive child discovers that the Iron Giant has the ability to combine superhuman powers with the best qualities of human nature. With the encouragement of his young friend, the gentle giant discovers his soul and learns about trust, friendship and respect for life. But will his true dark purpose lead to the destruction of all he has come to love? Is the power of friendship strong enough to save him not only from the prejudice of others but also from himself?This intelligent and moving film has much to offer to anyone who can put their own prejudices against `cartoons' and `kids films' aside. While being good fun for children, The Iron Giant has a depth that adults will appreciate. This is a more `grown-up' kind of animation - no singing and dancing animals and attention-stealing backdrops, no caricature sidekicks or too bad to be true villains; instead we are treated to a fully developed characterisation rarely seen in feature animations. The result is a small cast of believable and engaging characters who draw you into what could have been a predictable plot and who leave you caring about what happens to them. The story is by turns amusing, touching, dark and inspiring. The animation is clever and seamless, but understated, letting the wonderful characters take centre-stage.A talented cast breathe life into the characters, without turning them simply into animated versions of themselves - unlike some  actors in rival films. Hogarth Hughes, the boy who befriends the giant, is given a spirited and natural performance by young X. The powerful voice of Vin Diesel, by turns frightening, funny and heartbreakingly emotional, gives the mysterious yet lovable giant his soul. Jennifer Aniston is utterly convincing as Hogarth's mother Annie - a hardworking single mother desperately trying to be a responsible parent to her imaginative, energetic son, yet secretly in need of some magic in her own life. Harry Connick Jr. gives warmth and humanity to trendy beatnik Dean, a scrap-metal yard owner who turns junk into `art' and works hard at seeming a cool laid-back kind of guy, but hides behind the smooth exterior a caring, fun-loving personality who needs others more than he would admit.  Y is the villain of the story, as Kent -, the government official on a quest to destroy the `monster'. Driven by fear, misunderstanding and most of all the opportunity for self-advancement, Kent poses a real threat yet is also amusing and thoroughly believable. It is this thoughtful characterisation that makes the film so special - there are no extremes of good and evil, simply characters not very different from us, with a range of emotion and the potential to become what they choose. The films message, `You are what you choose to be,' reflects not only the inner struggle of the Iron Giant between the desire to do good and the instinct to destory, but the struggle inside of us all to be the best that we can.I was pleased and not at all surprised to see this animation voted number one in the Children's category on IMDb (April 2000). Kids will love it, and will maybe learn from it's message of non-violence and shaping your own destiny. But, whether you have children or not, I highly recommend this heart-warming and intelligent film. It is so much more than just another feature animation. In The Iron Giant, Warner Bros. has succeeded in avoiding the all too common pitfall of turning an animation into a poor imitation of Disney. They have instead combined their talents to produce a deeper, more intelligent story with a magic that is completely their own.",

It's a heartwarming and tear-jerking adventure that still holds a special place in my heart as being an animated film that has the potency of a live-action film and showing that animation doesn't need to adhere to the Disney formula of songs, animals and princesses.

            "content": "'The Iron Giant' is a breath of fresh air. At one point while viewing it I whispered to my friend seated next to me 'I am REALLY enjoying this'. The reason behind that statement is that most animated films these days seem to have been made with great skill and take us to places we could only imagine but their stories fall like a stone I have not been impressed by many of Disney's latest forays sans the 'Toy Story' movies and the breathtaking 'Hunchback of Notre Dame'. 'The Iron Giant' is not a Disney film but they could take a lesson from it. Here is a charming film that strips away the usual pretenses of animated features and flat out tells a good story.The story begins in October 1957, the night the whole world has its eyes open for Sputnik orbiting overhead. Out of the sky comes an alien from another world. A 100-foot metal-munching behemoth that is first seen eating straps of metal and eventually eats his way to the local the power plant.One of the pieces is a TV antenna belonging to Hogarth, a little boy living in a big house with his single mom. Just like the boy in another movie about a creature from space, he goes to investigate. He saves the giant from munching on power-lines and the two become friends.Naturally, Hogarth has to keep this enormous creature a secret from his mother and eventually from the government agents who come looking for it. What I appreciated most about 'The Iron Giant' was the care given to the smaller moments.Consider a scene in which the creature's hand comes off and runs around the house while Hogarth tries to keep his mother from seeing it. He opens the bathroom door and there is the hand stumbling around like a puppy with its wires wagging like a tail. Those are the kind of moments that fill the screen in 'The Iron Giant'. They aren't necessary to the story but I appreciate the efforts of the animators to take that extra step.The characters are fun too. Besides Horgarth there is a beatnik named Dean (Given a very daddy-o by Harry Connick Jr.) a dim-bulbed federal agent (Chris McDonald) and Hogarth's mother who isn't given the stereo-typical 'Go to your room' sternness but comes off as a woman genuinely concerned about her son.But I am forgetting the star of the show. The Iron Giant himself begins as a creature who doesn't understand the world that he had dropped into gradually gathers an understanding of love and friendship from Hogarth. He begins as a metal-munching monster and then understands humanity.He makes mistakes as in one thrilling scene in which he bends a railroad track just as the train approaches. He doesn't speak for most of the movie but when he does it is in a very low monotone with selective words. I also loved the look of the creature, his steam-shovel mouth and brawny frame look as if he has stepped right off the covers of those old science fiction magazines.I loved the Iron Giant for so many reasons. This is a movie trying to be different. It doesn't try to be a carbon copy of a Disney film. Dancing dishes and furry sidekicks are fine but personally I liked a movie like this, a movie with its feet on the ground and its heart \u2013 as well as its script \u2013 in the right place.",

The movie that has the same rags-to-riches plot, the search for self, the romantic culmination, the comedic sidekicks, etc, etc. And Disney has watered down its moral message so much to prevent offending anyone that there is hardly a moral message at all. The Iron Giant is the movie you WISHED Disney would make.The Iron Giant is set in the late 50's. The dual optimism and fear so prominent in that time period is reflected in the movie and used to great effect. Young Hogarth represents countless boys who have grown up wistfully dreaming of space fantasies. Mr. Mansley represents the fear of the Soviet Union and nuclear annihilation of that period.The boy finds the Iron Giant and is at once scared and sympathetic. The movie goes on to show how little boys are actually more adept at looking past fear than adults.The relationship shown between the boy and the Giant is one of the best demonstrations of friendship I have ever seen in the movies. This is a relationship you care about, far more so than in any of the Disney movies.And, unlike Disney, this movie takes moral stands unambiguously. The wildly careening and inappropriate grace is hysterically funny and very much believable for a young boy. And the thoughtful conversation between the boy and Giant about having a soul is filmmaking at its finest. The Giant's uncertain status-- Is it alive? Does it have a conscious? Does it have free will?-- makes one think more about the afterlife as a result.The confrontation between the Giant and the military is the one part of the movie that is action-oriented. And, like the rest of the movie, it is well-done.Unlike the Disney movies, or most any others, this is a movie that you do not know how it will end. I thought this as the confrontation started-- and wondered, will I be disappointed? Not to fear-- wow, the ending is super! It packs an emotional wallop. In fact, this ending will have you and your friends talking for days.I've been frustrated all too often at Hollywood movies for such technical brilliance but lame plots-- here is a sterling exception. The plot is what makes this movie so memorable. And not only for what it says, but for what it doesn't. Questions such as Where did the Giant come from?, Does Hogarth have a father and, if so, where is he? are left unanswered-- and the movie is all-the-better for it.The excellent story, emotional resonance, and wonderful moral messages make this a movie not to be missed (unfortunately, too many have since no Disney marketing campaign backed this film).

An ambitious feature based on the book \"The Iron Giant\". This property had legs, and could have been a series if handled properly--it wasn't. It was a financial success, however. Intentionally set in the early 1950's around the time of such wonderful nonsense as \"War of the Worlds\", \"Invaders From Mars\" and \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\". A young boy finds a giant robot and at first nobody believes him. The original purpose of it was to conquer planets, as it has laser beams and sonic rays, like all good giant monsters, but all it really wants to be is friendly, like Superman. It eats scrap metal, not people. A paranoid government agent sees it as a threat to all Mankind, and an Army General and troops are sent to destroy it, of course.

Mild violence (\"Bambi\" dies) and cuss-words: \"Hell\" used is few times. Make this inappropriate for very young kids, but otherwise quite acceptable. Your 8 to 10 year-old will love it! The T.V.\"Evil-Brain Monster\" sequence is also a bit scary! Buy this while you still can! I have to watch my VHS \"First Men in the Moon\" a while longer, as I waited too long. It is currently \"out-of-print\" on DVD, (until Sony makes more.)!",

            "content": "as a twenty-something year old man my favourite films include the likes of Reservoir Dogs, The Usual Suspects, Seven and I hope soon to see the Wolf of Wall Street. However, I have fond memories of my childhood, the days of Toy Story and Disney Classics. I say this to give context behind me stumbling upon The Iron Giant today on television. I partly remember really liking it as a child so I put it on in the background while I did some work, but within 5 minutes I was completely engrossed as this film is fantastic.This film is about a giant metal robot that arrives on Earth in the 1950s for unknown reasons and a boy who finds him and befriends him. The two form a heart-warming bond as the child tries to protect his new friend from a paranoid government official. This is set against the backdrop of the cold war and the suspicion and fear that came with it. I wont spoil any more but this film is so emotional I'm not ashamed to admit I felt a few tears once or twice. The story is very simplistic yet it touches on a number of ongoing political issues, most importantly that just because we don't understand something, doesn't mean it's a threat.Despite gong into these themes, the film never feel like it's preaching or talking down to the audience, and fortunately it came before the era when everything had to be very PC so don't expect anything like this film to be showing any time soon.To sum up my short review, this film is a must-see even for those who don't like animated films, I don't usually watch them but this is definitely an exception. This is a film to watch with your family on a wet weekend day when you're in the mood for being cosy. I think children will enjoy the aforementioned giant metal robot but the film goes so much deeper than that, making it possibly the best animated family film I've ever seen.",

THE IRON GIANT is an example of one that completely succeeds in that area. While children (particularly boys) will appreciate the friendship of a boy with a giant robot, Brad Bird also manages to send up the Cold War era and provides a strong anti-gun message. For someone's debut film, I thought it was particularly impressive considering this is the same guy who would later make THE INCREDIBLES and MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL. He shows a firm directorial hand and gets excellent voice performances from the talent involved. It also helps that the story is very streamlined, so there aren't any pacing issues. The story also takes a rather poignant turn in the end that is completely earned. If I had to pick a single favorite moment from the film, it would probably be the end. Overall, THE IRON GIANT is a touching children's film with a heavy dose of nostalgia for a simpler time. This is a great film that can be enjoyed by parents and children alike.",

            "content": "In the 1990's, it was rare for a studio besides Disney to release an animated film. So when Warner Brothers (home of Bugs Bunny) decided to release an animated film, everyone expected it to be some sort of \"Looney Tunes\" and were sorely disappointed when it was not.And that is too bad...for the film that was released - THE IRON GIANT - is a wonderfully warm and heartwarming tale of friendship, acceptance and, yes, intolerance of those different from you, set against the backdrop of the Cold War of the 1950's.Marking the full length feature animation Directing debut by Brad Bird (THE INCREDIBLES), THE IRON GIANT tells the tale of young Hogarth, who finds a...well...Iron Giant... who has fallen to Earth from Outer Space. Hogarth befriends The Iron Giant and helps to hide him from Military-types who see this as a threat to the safety, security and superiority of the United States.Featuring the vocal talents of Jennifer Aniston, John Mahoney, Harry Connick, Jr., Christopher McDonald and Eli Marienthal (as Hogarth), this film is warm and inviting, showing \"good characters\" that you want to root for and spend time with spar with \"bad guys\" that you want to see defeated. All of this over a character that is naive to what is going on around him. Special notice should be made of Vin Diesel's vocal work as The Iron Giant. He says very few things, but the words that he does say, convey strong emotions.You can see the seeds of THE INCREDIBLES in this work of Director Bird. The action sequences are fun and effective and are off-set by slower, more personal, scenes of the characters getting to know - and interact with - each other. He shows a deft touch in balancing these items, finding the right amount of pathos and pace throughout.The main themes in this film - fearing that which you do not know/do not care to understand resonates to this day and is a reminder that kindness can go much further than fear/ignorance/intolerance.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

            "review_title": "The best American animated feature of the last 20 years",
            "content": "Since the release of The Little Mermaid in 1989, Walt Disney Pictures has produced a cavalcade of animated masterpiece after animated masterpiece. That movie's success and the subsequent efforts from the same studio ushered in a renaissance of American animation. Megalomaniacal visionary Steve Jobs' belief in a small computer graphics studio, Pixar was directly responsible for the birth of the computer animation feature movie. Their list of accomplishments reads like a who's who and gave impetus to other creative forces to do the same. Since the seminal Toy Story, DreamWorks and Fox, among others, have followed Pixar's lead in that genre of animation. Yet, given Disney's pedigree and Pixar's mastery, one would be incredulous to learn that the best American-made animated movie of the last 20 years was directed by a virtual unknown (at the time) and was distributed (if you can call it that) by Warner Brothers and not any of the aforementioned masters of the art. That movie is the Iron Giant.The story of the Iron Giant is a cross between Beauty and the Beast and ET. It opens in space with a shot of Sputnik panning across the screen and something hurtling from space towards the planet. That something is the title character, a giant robot. Once on earth, the Giant proceeds to dine indiscriminately on the earth's varied cuisine of metal and steel. The Giant is befriended and spared electrocution by a young boy named Hogarth Hughes. The rest of movie tracks the two main characters on their quest to evade detection, have fun, and munch on all the metal that can be had. Along the way, the viewers are treated to a terrific parable about the futility of violence. Set against the backdrop of the early days of the Space Race, the reality of the Cold War helps to contrast the message the movie is sending.The day may be fast approaching where computers and animators can replicate the entire gamut of human emotions and characteristics and render a digital \"actor\" as realistic and compelling as any Academy Award winner. What the computers may not be able to ever do though is replicate the raw emotion that can be discerned from the human voice. In The Iron Giant, the emotions that come to the fore more often are joy, exuberance, and wonder. It is a testament to the actors involved in this feature that the characters are so compelling. Eli Marienthal voices the character of Hogarth with such delight that we can't help but wonder what has gone wrong in our world that we can't feel the same level of enjoyment. The fact that the young Mr. Marienthal is given such tremendous material only helps. Hogarth is an optimistic young man; he thinks the best of everyone and everything and one can't help but wonder if such open-mindedness is as a mechanism erected to keep out the rigors of growing up as a latch-key kid in a single parent home. And, his understanding of death as a part of life makes perfect sense when one considers the fact that this child has been subjected to the \"duck and cover\" instructional in school every year of his short life.If joy and optimism define Hogarth, then wonder defines the Giant. \"Voiced\" by Vin Diesel, the Iron Giant starts off as a enigmatic brute and transforms into an amalgam of childhood, best friend and parental figure. The young thespian gets very few lines of understandable dialog but those that he does get, he delivers with a tenderness that contrasts the mechanical nature of his character.Along with the two protagonists, the rest of the voice work is also excellent. Jennifer Aniston does a good job as Hogarth's single mother, conveying the exasperation a mother must feel when she has to deal with a bright child with an overactive imagination. Harry Connick Jr. is amusing as the beatnik scrap dealer, Dean who Hogarth befriends and who in turn befriends the giant. It goes without say that, given his philosophical tendencies, Dean is the first to accept what Hogarth has to say about the giant's benevolence. Finally, John Mahoney as General Rogard and Christopher McDonald as federal agent, Kent Mansley are also very good. The former comes across as the same sort of caring realist he played in Say Anything without the pen chance for fraud. The latter is positively delicious as a fed that has bought in to all the hype of the Cold War; he is truly drinking the McCarthy Kool Aid. In fact, if he weren't such a despicable guy who does some pretty despicable things, you can almost feel sorry for him.Technically speaking, the Iron Giant pales somewhat when compared to some of the other animated features that are its contemporaries. Even from a traditional animation standpoint, there are contemporaries whose craft stands out more than that of this film. And the main story itself is also simple. What makes this movie terrific is its heart. It gives us characters that we care for, human and otherwise and along the way of the story, it tries to teach it's audience profound lessons on fear and on violence as a solution (or, in this case, non-solution).9 stars out of 10",

In the film, young Hogarth Hughes of Rockwell, Maine, finds a giant robot in the woods behind his house.  With the robot apparently having lost his memory from a bump on his head, he befriends young Hogarth....actually, Hogarth befriends him. As most reviews have stated, there are no stupid Disney-used traits at all in this film.  NO dumb sidekicks, no stupid songs, and excellent characters, including the Giant himself.  Hogarth, his mother, and the rest, all feel and act like they should from their respective backgrounds.  So no one here is exceptionally heroic, or sarcastic. I have endless praise for this film.  It is bold and grand in every aspect.  It is my favorite film of all time, tied with the Matrix and South Park: Bigger, Longer, And Uncut. And on one last note, it would be a tragedy if this fine film is overlooked by other underdogs from this year such as the Sixth Sense and....well, so far, these are the only 2 movies this year that I have seen (with the possible exceptions of south park and the matrix) that deserve to be nominated this year.",

It has been years since the tears ran like that. I don't think I ever will forget that moment.\nI almost missed this movie, because I regarded it as a children's movie, and even though I always go to Disney's cartoon to see the fantastic pictures, this cartoon does not have that kind of drawings. So I was lucky, that so many other liked it, because when I saw that it was in top 100 on IMDb's Top 250 I said to my self: \"Well maybe this is worth watching\", and now you know that I think it was.\nBefore the terrible moment, there are laughs, excitement and all the other stuff that makes a good movie. I loved the scene with the hunters that shoots a poor deer, and then looks up, sees the Giant, and cries out: \"Oh no, it's the monster\". That's so ironic as can be. I think the movie does a good job; it can be enjoyed both by kids and adults. I have already mentioned why adults would like it, but when I just saw it, the rest of the audience consisted of children with there parent(s). I could here that the children liked it.

I remember Mansley getting his face squished in the door was one of the funniest things ever. I remember memorizing the scene of him pestering Hogarth with constant questions, after he rents the empty room in his house. The exchange of Mansley asking \"Where ya going, champ, chief, slugger? Where ya going? Where ya going?\" and Hogarth screeching back, \"I'm going out!!!!\" is something my siblings and I still quote to this day. But mainly I remember being absolutely flabbergasted when the Giant sacrifices himself to save Hogarth and the town. Growing up in a a Christian household, going to church twice a week, a story that ended with someone giving up their life for everyone else, was, well...biblical. I remember sitting in the theater and having the thought, \"He gave up his life so all those people could live\", running through my brain over and over. I couldn't comprehend it. I was too shocked to cry. Watching it for the first time as an adult? I sobbed. The tears started when the Giant realizes he can fly, and Hogarth gleefully tells him, \"Try holding out your arms in front of you, like Superman!\" and they didn't stop because I knew what was coming.

Kids films without substance are very familiar to most parents, but The Iron Giant hearkens back to a time when family and friendship meant everything.Although unusual in the sense that a boy named Hogarth (voiced by Eli Marienthal) befriends an alien robot simply called The Iron Giant (voiced by Vin Diesel), this animated feature still teaches kids the responsibilities of friendship and how devastating it can be to lose one.The set-up is common in that we see the military and government agents as bumbling morons who misunderstand the intentions of something as large and as powerful as a nearly indestructible robot. But understanding eventually reaches them, too, through the actions of Hogarth and his new alien buddy.More interesting than previous animation films for kids, this one shows not just the upside of this friendship, but the dangers ...as well as a fatal ending (sort of). Parents should be prepared to comfort their kids when The Iron Robot launches himself into space in preparation to save his best friend (Hogarth). The words \"Superman\" are uttered as The Iron Giant makes contact with the powerful and deadly rocket, and I'd be willing to bet that there's not an adult out there with any heart that won't swallow hard at those words.But there are plenty of fun and funny scenes to counter the more stark ones. Watching fellow humans complain to the local constabulary about suddenly absent mouthfuls of trucks, towers, and other metal munchables is pretty comical, as is a great scene where The Iron Giant does a cannonball jump into a favorite swimming hole of Hogarth's.A fun and serious film with themes that most parents will find a positive influence on the pliable minds of their young ones.",

It's a story set in the Red Scare era about a giant robot that crash lands on Earth. A young kid named Hogarth happens to find this robot and the two quickly develop a strong and powerful friendship. However, Hogarth must keep his giant friend safe as a snooping government worker named Kent tries to find out what Hogarth is hiding and whether or not it's dangerous (ie. built by the Russians). This is an incredibly moving, incredibly powerful film with a lot more to it than meets the eye.The Iron Giant starts out simple enough. It's a story we've seen before. A young boy befriends a larger than life person or thing, highlighting the innocent and non judgemental eye of a child. But this film makes this recognizable motif so powerful and so emotionally enthralling. It hits emotional chords that send chills up and down your body as the film roots itself into your heart. This is a shockingly poignant film with so much heart and a constant thread of sincerity running through it, despite it being a cartoon.This leads me to the other impressive thing about the film is the fact that it's a cartoon. You would expect it to be more in the league of some of the sillier and more light hearted Disney films like The Hunchback of Notre Dame or 101 Dalmations. Instead, The Iron Giant is much more complex and is more mature and intelligent than these films. And the cartoon element also makes it a visual spectacle that is simultaneously larger than life and down to Earth. This sincere parallelism makes the film entertaining and exciting as well as real as the story and characters connect on a very human level, even including and especially the Iron Giant himself, who proves to be more loving and more compassionate than most of the humans in this film. The emphatic realism of this film is enough to bring a tear to one's eye, and indeed it does.Don't underestimate The Iron Giant because of its simple cartoon exterior. It has a heart and a brain, and it has a surprising level of poignancy to it. This is a truly fantastic film that breaks new ground and proves just how human and just how emotionally superb a cartoon can be. This is a film that can't be missed, and must be experienced by anyone with a soul.",

            "content": "Only one and a half year prior to this heartfelt and passionate movie, WB released the bland and nonsensical Quest for camelot. That's a major improvement, because The Iron Giant delivers on every level! First of all, the setting of a Cold War America creates a wide range of possibilities of making conflict and is used to the fullest with a government agent being on the search for an unidentified fallen object. The tense atmosphere increases every time he acts, because of the relatability created by the setting. Speaking of the government agent, he is not the only character to add depth and dynamic to the movie, every character plays off of each other perfectly to add heart and soul to the movie's atmosphere. The relationship between the giant and the boy Hogarth is really heartfelt and well developed, what else could you desire but great main characters? The story about paranoia and how we perceive the unknown makes you think it's a dark and serious movie all throughout, but it manages to give some hillarious comedy as well without damaging the overall tone. Hogarth and the giant are lovely to watch and the junkyard owner share some hilarious moments with them when he discovers the giant.The animation has also taken a giant step upwards (no pun intended) since the underwhelming expirience in Quest for Camelot. The backgrounds are gorgeously detailed and mange to show the size of the giant's appearance in general and capture the even grander feel when he flies and especially in the epic climax. The design of the giant himself is also brilliantly done and how much emotion he is able to show despite the restraints of it.The initial release was not kind towards this animated gem due to bad marketing and lack of confidence in the movie from WB thanks to the failure of Quest for Camelot. I'm glad to see that The Iron Giant has gained praise over time and today is considered a modern classic. One of the best animated movies ever made if you ask me.",

The vividly drawn relationship between the giant and the boy is the most...human...and touching (without being maudlin) that I can remember in recent years, and that includes both children's films and so-called adult drama.  For that reason, maybe, it drew genuine emotion out of me, something that hasn't happened since I first saw Barry Lyndon (of all things) years ago.\nIt's sad that Disney has such a stranglehold on the genre. I was so grateful that there was not a single syrupy pop song in this movie that on the strength of that alone I might award it a \"10\" on IMDb.

A gigantic robot emerges and cuts a swath through the boreal forest on the way to a small town. It could be a weapon of the Soviets, a monster, an alien invader bent on destroying the earth, and more. When the iron giant encounters in its path a nine-year-old boy, Hogarth, it displays gentleness, keen intelligence and the innocence of a child. Hogarth is not the only one, of course, who knows about the robot. A fearful, negative and self-centered government agent attempts to corner the iron giant and triggers some adverse and alarming reactions. As the US Army responds, the robot and boy have only each other to turn to.While this animated feature is simple and straightforward in appearance, it carries a profound and touching message. There are many people who want you to live in a box they built for themselves, full of fear and negativity, yet we should decide for ourselves who we want to be. Even Superman or Superwoman are not out of reach, as the Iron Giant reveals. Brad Bird, one of the inspirations behind the rising Pixar Studio, reveals in this film why he is worth a damn. The film has depth, heart, soul and humor.",

            "content": "I'll admit it, I am beyond biased when it comes to The Iron Giant. I first saw the film when I was four back in 1999 and I immediately fell in love with it. I wanted to be Hogarth, I wanted my own Iron Giant, and quite frankly I wanted to be a filmmaker. This movie was my first real introduction to Superman, it was my first introduction to the Cold War, and it showed me the kind of America that I wanted to live in.I know that's heavy and seems like a lot, but honestly The Iron Giant is one of the best, if not THE best, animated films of all time, as well as just straight-up science-fiction masterpieces of all time. Just recently the film was re-released into theaters for two days as the \"Signature Edition\" with two additional scenes that they fully animated for this re-release. I was so excited to go but seeing as how I got to school in Bozeman, MT I was afraid that we wouldn't get it at our theater and I would have to drive to find one, but nevertheless it was there for two nights, and I went both even taking my 11 year old sister to one of my viewings.The Iron Giant teaches you the moral lessons you need to survive childhood and develop into who you are. \"You are what you choose to be\" is the main quote from the film and it certainly rings true. The Bible says, \"For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he...\" (Prov. 23:7), and this is exactly the message that this film points towards. It's funny, it's exciting, it's entertaining, it's compelling, and it's over-all original in the sense that the magic of this movie has never been re-created on the big screen, in my opinion.The Iron Giant is my all-time favorite film, so I'm obviously biased, but beyond the emotional attachment I have to it from my childhood, as I continue to watch this film throughout my adult life, it always brings out the child in me, and I always tear up at the end (don't worry, I won't spoil it). This movie rocks, and I can't thank Brad Bird enough for bringing to life Ted Hughes' \"The Iron Man\" in the form of The Iron Giant.",

For most of its running time, its a decent if unspectacular animated feature showing the relationship between a giant robot and a young boy. The era is the 1950s and cold war paranoia is at an all time high. The film is highly critical of the various investigative agencies. However, what really works is the ending. It is very emotional and makes you re-evaluate the entire film. The voice work is unremarkable and there are no cute talking animals or light-hearted pop culture references that currently plague most animated feature films. Worth watching.Overall 8/10",

The Iron Giant is a great entertaining movie, however there are some deep emotions and thinks in it. It's more adventures than Finding Nemo, more funny than The Incredibles, deeper than The Lion King, the recall of the Cold War feeling is brilliant, and the final action-scene is...

            "content": "More of a retrospective commentary than a review; what follows is completely spoiler-free in terms of plot points, but is intended as an admiring post-script annotation to the film's thematic legacy and resonance.The Iron's Giant is simply the best animated feature ever made and one of the most subtly sophisticated conscience driven \"films\" in all of Cinema. In addition to the elegant old-school cell animation, wonderful adventure, and truthful humor -- auteur Brad Bird's tour-de-force quietly and magnificently emerges as much more than just another innocuous warm-hearted family friendly diversion.Set in cold-war paranoia & post nuclear Rockwellian/Capra-esque New England/Americana nostalgia, this all-time classic gem -- with sublime eloquence and earnest maturity -- beautifully dignifies powerfully principled pronouncements on prejudice, xenophobia, alienation, anti-authoritarianism, nonviolence, and moral identity; Of lonely boyhood reverie and single-working-mother/son repport; surrogate family in father figures, secret bonds & empathetic brotherhoods; tolerance, compassion, free will, devotion, sacrificial love, and the nature of consciousness and the concept of a spiritual soul. But far from heavy-handed frothy proselytizations, it wisely finesses those virtues subtextually into the nuances while rendering a completely involving fantasy story of a boy coming of age through a symbiotic relationship with an otherworldly friend that rivals Spielberg's \"E.T. The Extra Terrestrial\" in pure exhilarating enchantment! This movie is all lunch-boxes, no soap-boxes.Perhaps The Iron Giant's most profound platform however is the bitterest pill: running against the modern hedonistic zeitgeist of coddled indulgence and fickle fluidity to shrug, \"The Iron Giant\" gracefully drives its primary message that each sentient individual of seminal volition is autonomously responsible for the decisions that ultimately define their position as a cognizant being. Regardless of birth or influence, every conscious entity with the capability to express love or hate beyond self preservation, has the self-agented obligation in full context of their ethical effect upon the existing morale they help mold to mindfully choose what and who they are -- even at the rejection of core inclination. It's the total opposite to excusing one's self because of proclivity. In this life each Soul is sole, but the lone quest to find purpose through harmonization, because all are connected beyond the dirt we return to, and everything counts, every attitude ripples, and every action reveberates. No one who is able, can dismiss that ability by citing implement or impediment as the deciding factor to their path. It doesn't espouse the total embrace of what one wants most, but rather the total thoughtfulness to what wants most from one -- what is right and worthy of one's \"oneness\", and where one fits into carrying that through for the sake of togetherness.Disney will glorify the vapid virtue of \"being yourself\", while The Iron Giant will implore the existential ethic to find yourself by being beyond just yourself. The high-road will always be up-hill, but \"you are who you choose to be\".In empathetic powers, anyone can resolve to become \"Super\" by submitting to a supreme ethos/pathos/logos which reciprocates the sacrifice of superficial selfishness with the significance of synthesis in shared sacredness.Who you choose to be is dependent on what you will choose to service.",

But what really shines is the story. The writing is sharp, and so are the voiced performances. But I give Iron Giant an 8, rather than a 10, for two reasons.\nFirst, beginning with the 'Bambi' scene, the last third of the movie is stained by typical Hollywood politically-correct bigotry. This was entirely unnecessary to the story. Why the film makers chose to deface their own creation this way is their business, but it angered me. Maybe they were betting that most viewers are too naive or too stupid to notice a little gratuitous hate-mongering. Maybe it was a condition of their getting funded by a big Hollywood studio. Maybe it was an element of the original book (which I have not read), but if so, it should have been changed to fit the rest of the movie, rather than being left in place to scar it.\nPossible SPOILER follows... Second, at the climax, there is a hole in the logic of the plot large enough to fly a phalanx of iron giants through. I refer to the way the giant chooses to deal with the [seriously anachronistic] missile warhead, given the capabilities he has demonstrated moments before. Are we supposed to believe that this earnest good-hearted giant has been miraculously transformed into a weepy-eyed Hollywood parlor pink? I don't think I can willingly suspend that much disbelief. But enough complaints. Despite its flaws, this is a wonderful movie. 8/10.",

We are carried along by the story and the curiosity about what will happen next to Hogarth and his giant friend.   One of the best sequences in the film is toward the end when the Giant and Hogarth are knocked out of the sky. Once they land, the Giant shows more emotion and range than many living actors can muster. The result is a scene that's full of power and emotion.

We sat there in an almost empty theatre(due to THE IRON GIANT'S infamous bad advertising campaign) on a Saturday afternoon with ZERO anticipation for what we were about to watch for the next hour and a half.What we did see was an indescribable movie going experience. I hadn't been moved by a movie so much in my life let alone a 'cartoon'. The next few weeks was me racing against the clock to get everyone I knew to see it before it's short theatre run was over. Everyone that listened to me thanked me for my diligence.SEE THIS MOVIE if it's the last thing you do it's worth all 86 minutes!!!\nYOU ARE WHO YOU CHOOSE TO BE...SUPERMAN!",

            "content": "Just a quick comment to let you all know how much I liked 'The Iron Giant'. This is an awesomely non-computer generated and more traditional animated film from those folks at Warner Bros. It is set in the 1950s during the cold war, and it has great characters like Hogart Hughes (voiced by Eli Marienthal), and the robot Iron Giant itself (Vin Diesel). The best character was for me was the villain in Kent Mansley (voiced by Christopher McDonald) who was a typical stereotype of that era. Jennifer Aniston, John Mahoney and Harry Connick Jnr also provide the voices for the supporting characters. 'The Iron Giant' is a very enjoyable film with a great overall message with reasonably deep subtext if you think about it for awhile. All in all, animated films usually work for me in general, even though I'm an adult. I'd recommend 'The Iron Giant' for kids for the characters and story, and for adults for the overall message within it. **** out of *****!",

Since I am watching it quite late, it felt like a combination of 'How to train your dragon' and 'Super 8'. A huge robot descends from the sky and has a rocky landing that makes it forget what it is. It reaches a small sedate village looking for metal to eat when a boy stumbles upon it and saves the giant from getting electrocuted. The giant grows an affection towards the boy and the boy teaches him words and general human stuff. When the government comes to know of it and comes with it's big guns, the giant has to remember what the boy has thought him. The animation and mannerisms of the characters are very Disney like swaying away gaily. The story centers a lot on friendship and righteousness while the robot structure is too corny. It has to eat metal to survive, shows those funny expressions while showing emotions etc. Some action sequences at the end are pretty decent though. Though it is done with right intentions, it is strictly a kids movie.",

It was barely advertised in it's day, and despite Brad Bird (The Simpsons, etc.) and a well known cast, \"The Iron Giant,\" unfortunately, is overlooked my most viewers.Granted, it's not a perfect film. There were some inaccuracies, especially with regard to the military, and some might argue that it runs short at 87 minutes.

The Iron Giant illustrates friendship in a somewhat odd way, with a robot from outer space. The writing and the voicing is almost perfect and the whole animation thing wears away a little after you keep watching. It feels like a real movie with real emotions and that's what it is. I swear the ending is chilling and emotional to see. But the film bonds together the two in the most unique way and the kid shows the Iron Giant rules and lessons about the world they live in. So that pretty much sums it up, this film is a beautiful experience with a heartwarming friendship that is so interesting to see unfold. Aside from being animated (not really that big of a problem, especially how you just forget about it) this film is a must-see. 8/10.",

            "review_title": "A delightful and imaginative family film!",
            "content": "It's hard to make a family film in the 1990's.  If you do not have the name \"Walt Disney\" placed before the title of your family film, it's usually a sure bet that your movie won't make much money in the box office, but the film will do well in the video market.  But every now and then there is a family film that rises out of the juvenile and childish ashes and shines brightly on the faces of both the young and old.  In 1995 Universal released that family film, and it is titled BABE.  In 1997 Fox released their family film titled ANASTASIA, which was both spectacular and fantastic.  Now it's Warner Bros. turn, and their film is called THE IRON GIANT, which isn't only the best family film of the year, but one of the best movies of the year. THE IRON GIANT takes place during the Communist scare of 1957. It's the animated tale of a young boy named, Hogarth Hughes (voiced by Eli Marienthal) who is kind, smart, and intelligent.  Hogarth lives with his mom, Anne Hughes (Jennifer Aniston) who is a waitress at the town's popular diner.  One night while Hogarth's mom is working late at the diner, Hogarth is up late at night watching t.v., until the  reception goes bad.  Hogarth sees that the antenna for the t.v. is missing, and there's a trail leading out to the woods.  Out in the woods Hogarth sees a 100 foot tall metal robot that's made of metal, that is at first eating the metal off of a electrical power station, until the robot gets tangled in the power lines and is getting electrocuted.  Hogarth, with sypmathy, turns off the power to the station and saves the robot.  It is then that the young boy and the robot become friends. Meanwhile, one of the fishermen who's boat crashed into the robot while it crashed landed on earth, calls the government and they send over government agent Kent Mansley (Christopher McDonald).  Mansley believes that the robot will pose a threat to the people and sees that it must be found and destroyed.  So Hogarth decides to hide the robot in the town's junkyard run and owned by beatnik Dean McCoppin (Harry Connick Jr.).  It's only a matter of time that Hogarth teaches the Iron Robot the ways of life, before agent Mansley finds the robot. Parents complain that Hollywood needs to make more family orientated films.  Well, Waner Bros. (a Hollywood studio) had made the ideal family film, and sad to say, nobody is seeing it. While parent groups are in meetings bashing such films as: MATRIX, WILD WILD WEST, AMERICAN PIE, AUSTIN POWERS 2, and SOUTH PARK; they are guilty of not letting their children watch a great movie like this.  Instead, these \"guilty\" parents are letting their children become lab-rabbits and let them be exposed to such adult orientated films as the ones I meantion above, and then go to meetings and rallies to protest the films that shouldn't be viewed by young children.  Or maybe these parents don't really want to see a children's film, and would rather see a film that they would want to see, and bring their children along so they can spend the money on refreshments and not on some baby-sitter. That's a shame, since this is a excellent family film, yet like ANASTASIA, it's not pulling in much money into the box office.  Perhaps it's because that children would rather see talking animals than an animated person, that would explain on why BABE was such a big hit (but please, DO NOT let them watch the upcoming TNT film ANIMAL FARM, that will traumatize kids for years). What I personally liked about THE IRON GIANT is two things: the cute homage to the life-style of the 1950's, and the humor. First the homage, this film really makes a nice and witty look at what life was like in the 50's.  From the cheesy \"Duck & Cover\" films, to the witty satire of the sci-fi/horror films. Then there's the humor, where nothing is offensive, but it's still funny and clever.  No wonder, THE IRON GIANT is directed by Brad Bird, who has made some of the funniest animated t.v. shows ever.  Including the AMAZING STORIES episode of \"THE FAMILY DOG,\" THE CRITIC, KING OF THE HILL, and my favorite, THE SIMPSONS.  I think Disney is missing out on not having Brad Bird work for them, he would turn Disney's animated films from cutesy to witty, and hopefully less musical numbers. But since THE IRON GIANT, is still playing in the theaters, go take the kids to see it!!!  And if you don't have any kids, go see it anyways!!! I would rather take kids to see this film than INSPECTOR GADGET. The critics would also agree with me, but people don't like to listen to critics.  But it's the critic's that people should listen to when it comes to a family film, since most critics reccommend BABE, ANASTASIA, and THE IRON GIANT. It's a really touching and nice family film that comes out every so often that will entertain both the young and the young at heart. And I forgot to mention, the animation was great!!!!  ***** (out of five)",

I took my 5 year old son and since it was a cartoon, I was expecting your standard song filled, goofy side kick, and simple minded story lines many cartoons have. I was expecting to take a nice nap in the cool theater, but that immediately changed when we showed up to the theater. We were a couple minutes late and we came in during the boat in the storm scene. I was immediately impressed with the animation and the very first shot of the the Iron Giant. Any thoughts of a nap went by the wayside and both my son and I watched the movie with complete wide eyed awe. The characters were simple, real, funny, sad, and just perfect. The animation is what really made this movie so great for me and yes, I shed some tears at the end.It's amazing that this movie was considered a bomb but it was due to the total lack of marketing and the commercials gave you no idea what the movie was about.In 2019, we went to see the 20 year anniversary release at a local theater and it was so great to see again on the big screen. Leaving the theater, I chatted with a long haired, bespectacled older man and I mentioned how amazing the animation was. He said he loves to hear that because he worked on the movie. I asked him what he did on it and he said \"The water\" He did the water in the storm and tidal wave scene. I remember how cool I thought it was when I saw it in 1999, so it was really cool to meet someone who not only worked on the film, but did such an impressive job.This movie is one of those films guaranteed to make me cry and it does for pretty much anyone I know who has seen it. I have a running joke with a friend when we have both been drinking and pretty drunk, I will turn to him and say \"You stay.....I go.... No following...\" and every single time he will say \"Oh, you SOB.....\" and start tearing up! Lol.Anyway........",

            "content": "The Iron Giant is a film co-written and directed by Brad Bird. This film was on my radar for quite some time since it is directed by Brad Bird. Finally, I decided to watch the film and I can say that it was definitely great.Plot: Hogarth befriends a giant robot but also has to defend the robot from a ruthless government official.Story and direction: This film was in the traditional animation form which incorporated little CGI. At a time when CGI films were on the rise, bringing out such a film is a risk. With Brad Bird as the captain of the ship, what is to go wrong?? Nothing. Director's like Brad Bird is why I love animated films. Not only do they have such a good story but a message that is relevant and should be applied too in real life. This film deals with themes that no one at the time dealt with and is still relevant even in this world where technology has dominated every aspect of our lives. The film also very beautifully shows that it is not necessary to be human to have feelings. Everyone has feelings. Brad Bird and his team were able to grasp my attention in this 87 minute film. But it is quite sad to know that this film didn't work wonders at the time of its release. Some things quite notable are the designs for the town and the robot. They are impeccable and beautiful. Even the characterization work in the film is just spot-on. The bond formed between Hogarth and the robot seems real. Kent's character has been beautifully portrayed in the film. Even the voice work of this film is excellent and I couldn't fault it for even a second. There are some jokes in this film that I laughed and also some scenes which made me very emotional. The music by Michael Kamen also does wonders and goes with the flow of the film. If I had to nit-pick this film for any flaw, I would say it was the story. Many movies have shown such stories and the subject I would say was nothing new.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Hogarth decides to tell a bed-time story to the robot so that he could fall asleep. He has different books with him and tells them the gist of two of them. This scene just resonated with the main theme the film deals with and very correctly justifies the difference between good and evil.Verdict: As a first timer director, Brad Bird just hit a bulls eye. I was impressed with almost every aspect of the film. This film proves that medium is not necessary to bring across your point. If the message is correct and properly shown, then the medium doesn't matter that much. Even after the film ended, I was thinking about the film. And thank god, the film wasn't made into a musical (which was actually the original plan of the makers). For those who have loved Brad Bird animated films and think that he is one the great animators at present, I urge you to watch this film. It is a beautiful and thought provoking feature. I was highly impressed by it and sure that you will be too.I am going with a 9/10.",

Overall, I think it worked fairly well.  Nice animation, retro-design characters, simple but sophisticated plot, and just the right touch of visual humor, e.g. the robot mimicking the child's postures, the detached hand running amok through the house, etc.  Ignore the preachy anti-gun message (which was, by the way, lost on the younger kids in the audience - my four year old thought the iron giant was cool because \"he had all those guns that could blow up tanks\"), and you have yourself one very entertaining movie.  Maybe they could have made the moral more reasonable, i.e. \"gun's can be good if used defensively\", but I guess that would have (** spoiler alert!! **) made the ending far less dramatic -  a blast from one of the robot's lasers would probably have sufficed.I saw \"Iron Giant\" a few weeks after release, and the theater was, sadly, almost empty.  Word-of-mouth and critic reviews have been very good, so I guess we would have to chalk it up to poor marketing.  Hope this doesn't sour Hollywood on an alternative to the standard Disney formula.Its no \"Beauty and the Beast\", but I would still give it a solid 7.5/10.

With the help of a beatnik scrapyard owner, he takes on a government agent filled with Cold War paranoia in order to save their iron friend. The Iron Giant is funny, thoughtful and has heart. The script respects the intelligence of young and old, and the under-90 minutes running time attests to the brisk pace and judicious lack of exposition. Our hero Hogarth has a child-like curiosity about his new friend, and a fierce loyalty, all the while keeping sentimentality in check. A quasi-religious theme is lightly threaded through, and an anti-war message is more more strongly foregrounded. But none of these elements detract from an engaging tale of a young boy who is bullied at school looking out for his new-found friend. A good example of what animation can achieve when the screenplay is considerate of its audience.",

Because some things simply fly over the heads of the youth that's why it's so much fun to watch such films again a few years later when you can enjoy them again with a completely different look, but it was still presented interesting enough that he aroused the interest of one.\n(PS: For a change we have a movie without a villain but just people with different opinions and views) I'm pretty impressed with love, music and animation. I do not think it's too bad that we have too much 3D animation movies but most movies and I mean films in general are bland and they're just too different.\nThis topic already looks like a lost art because such films are no longer made these days.\nIf you made a live-action movie out of it then only Steven Spielberg would have the talent and experience to get close to this result. With a \"PG-13\"? I'm not 100% sure because we know that Spielberg can also press on the violence Tube, when I think of the scenes in which the robot goes rampage, I wonder if Spielberg would hold back nowadays.Brad Bird is just an artist and a genius. Not only do we have a movie with a realistic kids character that is not a bit annoying, but we have real family drama but not the embarrassing way of today's reality TV of all Kardashian scrap, proper social criticism but the message of the movie is not going to be that extreme beaten whit a Sledgehammer so that it is the movie enjoyment in the way. And I was fascinated as a little boy by the mother (Annie Hugher).\nAs a child, I have seen very few animated films because I find them just too childish, uninteresting and too good. Besides, the constant musical numbers just annoyed me. Thankfully, this movie has none of this * and I love it *.\n(Of course not every movie needs sex, violence and cussing\nbut not every movie has to be like a fairy tale)I have never had to cry at a movie, but this is one of the few movies where not much is missing to open my locks.However, my heart always is.This is one of the smartest movies I've ever seen in my life.\nUnfortunately, he is a dying race, both in terms of style and genre, one more reason to keep the movie in his honor and show it to as many people as possible.I thank you for your criticism and your super interesting videos quieter more often videos about movies from the nostalgia department I'm curious what other people say about it and if maybe there is not one or the other movie of which I have not heard.",

            "content": "Which is basically it. When you compare this type of animation with (dare I even mention it) Disney you feel quite let down. The people are unrealistic but this can be tolerated because they are stylised, which is fine if you like that sort of thing. Some of the backgrounds ARE beautiful especially the sea and snow, it is also nice to see how the weather and seasons slowly change throughout the film. The main problem (as I see it) is that some objects, especially the cars and quite noticeably the tractor looks 2 dimensional. This is the first time I have ever noticed this on ANY movie. I suppose it is because the quality of animation does not match the background.The actual robot is computer animated but because he is put into a movie with low quality animation you simply don't notice it, instead the robot looks like he was drawn with great care by a skilled animator (with normal animation) and then placed in TV quality animation.But I am afraid I am just being picky the quality of animation is unlike don Bluth or Disney but it is effective. After 10 or 20 minutes you forget about the animation and fall in love with the story.This is one movie where the STORYLINE TOOK PLACE OVER THE EFFECTS AND ANIMATION. Which is a nice change especially since the horrible trash Disney produced last year with Tazan. This is what made it such a pleasure to watch. It is a touching film in which I dare anyone to view and not feel compassion for the giant robot with a big heart. The animators did a noticeably good job at making a ridged iron face show warmth and love .(WARNING THE NEXT FEW LINE MAY CONTIAN MINOR SPIOLERS DEPENDING ON YOUR OWN POINT OF VIEW)The part when he prodded the dead dear and when he thought the boy was dead was quite frankly a masterpiece of effort. It is this sort of atmosphere that so many modern animated films lack. The LAND BEFORE TIME showed this depth of sadness and it can be seen with this film as well. To really enjoy a happy ending you must first feel sadness and pain. This is how I feel anyway a sad part in a film is essential for getting it's audience to care about it's characters. I gave this movie 9 out of 10, because I really do think the quality of animation (not the style the quality) could have been improved.But the best comment I can make on this movie is this- I asked my little 7 year old brother whether he liked the movie or not and he said `I WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN' . He had never said that about any movie he has seen. So I can think of no higher praise for such a brilliant movie.",

The central figure, the alien robot construct, is as grand and cool a physical design for a robot as ever put on film; but then this is perfectly balanced with the character of the robot, a being who is sentient and loyal, as he understands it.The robot, befriended by a young boy who is himself a SF b-movie junkie during the reactionary '50s time period, engages the boy and the boy's beatnik confidant with his trust, allowing the film to briskly detail the Giant's advances, as he comes to understand his own nature, the possibility of becoming a deadly weapon and a \"monster\" from the boy's comic books, and his understanding of heroism and love for his friends. In a world which is dangerous for the robot, and he in turn a danger to it because he is built to destroy, rather than love, the Giant's story of coming to the realization of what and who he truly is has a poignancy that is simply amazing. It is a story of redemption as great as the classic monster icons that have inspired this movie, such as the deformed Quasimodo of Notre Dame's saving of the beautiful, wrongly-accused Esmeralda who will be executed unless he protects her, even if he must die for her, loving the unattainable beauty he loves but can never have, or Frankenstein's Monster destroying himself and his newly-created Bride of Frankenstein because they are, in the Monster's opinion, a vile affront to nature.The Giant too realizes he must do what he has to, in order not to be a monster. It is one of the grand moments in cinema when the robot faces his fate, and becomes more than human in the process. An amazing film worth seeing many, many times.",

However on the other hand we have Mansley,a scrawny,self righteous and antagonistic government worker who from the get go this movie wants you to hate,he is such a judgemental person who is ready to accuse anyone of anything as long as it means he is celebrated for his actions.Now you should have a good idea that I'm going to recommend this one,hell,many of you have probably already seen it by now,nevertheless I recommend it.",

The end is heartbreaking and the last scene is a fantastic way to end the movie.Laughs are made all the way through the movie and my personal favourite part was when Hogarth was trying to get the giants hand out of the bathroom, in doing so, creating so much noise that his mother and Kurt - the inspector - run upstairs and storm in on him on the toilet.This movie is fantastic and no one should miss the chance to experience such a marvellous film.

Despite that, it is still a movie that anyone can see and still feel something from it. It's an emotional and charming trip through the friendship of a young boy and a giant robot. It is also Vin Diesel at his finest, despite his role being a giant metal man that can barely speak. Eli Marienthal, who plays Hogarth, also did a fantastic job in portraying a rebellious young boy in 1957. The plot also accurately portrays the concerns regarding the 1950's with the Cold War, as it does mention nuclear weapons a couple times in the film.Overall, I would strongly recommend that this movie be watched.

The film contained some of the smoothest animation ever, with CG elements flawlessly incorporated into the traditional elements.  Vibrant colors and wonderfully expressive characters make the movie much more than a cartoon - it is merely animated life. \tThe story is a gem.  The hypothetical question \"what if a gun had a soul?\" lies at the heart of the plot, and issues, of spirituality, redemption, and sacrifice make the plot much more substantive than anything Disney churns out to make a quick buck.  There are parts where I actually teared up.  Yes, I admit it, a strapping young man such as myself actually cries at films if they deserve it, and this one does.  The fact that very few people actually saw this film is very upsetting to me.  It is the perfect movie for parents to take their children to, because not only will their children be wildly entertained by the endearing, larger-than-life title character, but they as parents will also enjoy a rich movie experience - thanks to a script which pokes fun at Cold War hysteria and propaganda, among other things. \tThis review might ramble, but let's wrap it up like this:  This is a fabulous movie for the young and old.

            "content": "The Iron Giant presents a well-written and visually appealing story that works better than most Disney movies.  Set in 1957, it explores half-seriously, half tongue-in-cheek the stereotypes and the reality of \"G-men\" and the US military mindset, the cold war, and life at the start of the space age.The story is told from the point of view of the boy, Hogarth, who is a believable and sympathetic character.  A couple of anthropomorphic elements can be seen in the robot, but it's not hard to suspend disbelief since these elements are subtle and not the primary driver of character development. The robot character is somewhat enigmatic/alien, which only serves to make the story more intriguing rather than confusing.The other characters are enjoyable, even though they are somewhat flat (to varying degrees).  The humor is not as sophisticated as, say, The Simpsons, but it's never annoying, overly juvenile, nor over-the-top as it can be in most Disney movies.By the conclusion, I found myself unexpectedly moved, thanks to the well-crafted sympathy-inviting character development.  Despite the use of some standard plot devices, The Iron Giant is certainly a movie I plan to share with my future children, and one that I will enjoy right along with them.  Highly recommended.  Overall score: 9.",

            "content": "This movie is beautiful, and full of neat details. Visually, I'd give it at least an 8. There's lots to love technically, the sound is great, the characters really work, and there are a lot of laughs. Unfortunately, the story is wretched at best, and actively evil at worst. The message is hypocritical in the extreme. Where Spiderman told us (rightly) that \"with great power comes great responsibility\" this excuse for a moral tale says that with great power comes nothing but danger, and suicide is probably the best course of action. All violence is bad, and we can all choose what we want to be; even giant killer robots can be transformed into giant pu$$ies by the miracle of a small boy's love and friendship. Barf. As a moral tale, this is hypocritical and irresponsible garbage at best. The boy solemnly lectures the robot about death, saying \"guns kill\" as if that's a bad thing. They mourn the death of a deer at the hands of evil hunters. But the boy is not a vegan, nor is his mother. So killing is okay as long as someone else does it, at a distance. That's amoral hypocrisy, nothing more. It gets worse- obviously the Iron Giant is a symbol, and he is the hero of the story, because he is the only character who changes. What is he a symbol for? Well, for Man's \"destructive\" and \"flawed\" nature. But the Iron Giant is obviously and explicitly a creation of something- he's a built artifact. So this implies a Creator metaphor; we're talking about God as Creator here. But God in this story is flawed, defective: He built a good, tender, sensitive creature and made the mistake of encasing that gentle soul in the form of a weapon. Or, He built a weapon and made the mistake of giving it a tender heart. Either way, God is flawed. Worse, the giant killer robot can't even distinguish a toy from a real threat, and thus self-defense is portrayed as unacceptably dangerous. And the only way to remedy this flaw is for the unfortunate creature to \"nobly\" sacrifice himself rather than taking responsibility and using his tremendous power for good. The message is therefore ultimately Satanic: God is bad, and you're better off dead. When good people (and robots?) refuse to take their power, bad people take it by default. After all, a key component of evil is the lust for power over others. When evil has convinced everyone that the only acceptable method of resistance is pacifism, disempowerment, surrender, and suicide, then evil has truly won. Have we really fallen so far that we no longer know how to fight the good fight? Do we really think that all violence is \"bad\"? Have thousands of years of culture, morality, and civilization really been swept away by a few decades of propaganda? The fact that this artful piece of toxic amorality has gotten so much acceptance suggests that much has been lost. The film is worth seeing as a pretty film, but I'd recommend sitting down afterward and discussing the values and lessons here with your family, in a critical way. I sure as hell wouldn't plunk my kid down in front of this with no discussion, because it's a powerful piece of propaganda that needs deconstruction. Or just destruction.",

Kill a few hours, enjoy the evening.I was quite surprised at what I discovered.I never expected to encounter such a rich story with beautiful animation, three dimensional characters -- even the antagonist wasn't your run of the mill clich\u00e9. I especially loved the intelligent dialogue that provided sharp insight into Cold War and even modern day paranoia. And the climax...just not something no one but Brad Bird and his team would have the cajones to put into a kids film.Many have harped on the marketing and I am piling on, Warner Bros. screwed up royally.

A person could afford to miss IG; I don't think anyone should miss PoE.Having said that, I still join the chorus in praising IG.  It is really a very good cartoon.  The animation and artwork are all you've heard, yet done in a 50-ish graphical style.  The plot is interesting, and moves right along.  While I don't appreciate the one-sided \"guns-are-all-evil\" (and so are hunters, depicted as the descendants of the men who killed Bambi's mom) message, I do enjoy the skepticism about arrogant government agents, and the more complex depiction of the Giant's personality.  (The latter harkens to Karloff's Frankenstein, a monster not by his own choice.)Go to the movie for a good time, not expecting the Second Coming of Christ, and you'll find your money well-spent.",

            "content": "\"The Iron Giant\"\"Tarzan\" brought Disney animation back to working order this summer with it's rich animation, terrific narrative songs, and a specific attention to what made the previous Disney blunders fail both critically and financially. \"Tarzan\" still played by the tired Disney rules, but they are learning. With Warner Brothers animation, they seem to be taking more risks with their own product. From the cross-promotion antics of the lively \"Space Jam\" to the noble failure of \"Quest For Camelot\", The WB has been fighting mightily to grab the animation crown of recognition that sits rusted on top of mount Disney. With \"Iron Giant\", Bugs and company jump miles ahead of any cartoon competition (except for the \"South Park\" feature) to create a timeless, and nearly flawless, animated feature. You just know you're in good hands when director Brad Bird's past credits include a stint as a writer-director on the genius animated show \"The Simpsons\". That show often goes out of it's way to parody Disney animation and others of it's ilk. Bird knows exactly what trappings to avoid and what emotional buttons to push. It is this knowledge in the end that makes \"Giant\" so effective. The story, based on a children's novel entitled \"The Iron Man\", is set in 1957, just as the cold war was getting warm. Hogarth Hughes is a precocious 10 year-old boy with big dreams trapped in a paranoid society in deep fear of the Red Menace. His single mother (voiced with honey by Jennifer Aniston, who's name is misspelled in the end credits) works long hours to pay the bills, and Hogarth is often left alone and lonely. When an iron robot crash lands on Earth one stormy night, Hogarth discovers the Giant and quickly befriends the dazed and confused robot. Soon after, a government agent (another sneaky Christopher McDonald acting job) learns of the Giant's appearance and sets out to destroy the Giant without ever truly understanding that the robot means no harm. One of the first things that director Bird gets just perfectly is the tone and color of 1950's America. Now, we've seen this period time and again in movies, just not this accurate. The threat of Russian invasion hangs in the air like an old sock. The kids watch \"duck and cover\" reels in school. The government, having been burned by Sputnik, experiences the itchiest trigger finger know to man. All the \"Leave It To Beaver\" type material is represented in this film as well, but for a movie aimed at 10 year-olds? Warner Brothers and Brad Bird deserve much credit for keeping this cartoon more cerebral than any in recent history. This is one good script and story, told with zest and intelligence. I also applaud the simple notion of keeping the Giant's origins a mystery. We never know where the Giant came from or what it's purpose in the grand scheme of things inevitably is. With every film wasting time spelling things out for the audience, \"Iron Giant\" asks you to just use your imagination. What a notion.Using period pastels and detailed architecture, it is the look of this animated feature that truly thrilled me. So used to current Disney animation am I that to see a cartoon in the widescreen format literally makes me weep (even if it ends up being the lame Super 35 format). \"Giant\" easily is the best looking cartoon to come around in decades. It looks like they spent 3 years on each shot. Bird and crew create a unique looking film that seems to be born of the comics and the animation itself of the day. With five o'clock shadows on the men, deliriously wrinkled faces of the aged, and the scary waistlines of the women, \"Giant\" is spot-on with it's drawings. I could watch the film time and again just for the animation. It makes up for some iffy drama that occupies the film's 2nd act.To see a film like \"Inspector Gadget\", with it's relentless delivery and shameless corporate plugs(I know \"Giant\" will have a merchandising landslide, but the film never feels like a 90 minute toy commercial), make a killing at the box office, it's imperative that a film like \"Iron Giant\" be known. We need more story-centric cartoons like this. I'm embarrassed to admit that I felt an outpouring of emotion at the end of the film. It's rare to get an animated feature that engages the crowd with lovable characters without being so calculated. It's even more rare to get an animated film that has no songs to drown the narrative. \"Iron Giant\" is told clean and true. The bittersweet climax (reminiscent of the traumatizing \"Fox And The Hound\") left me thrilled with \"Iron Giant\" even more. This is one good animated film that should finally put Warner Brothers on the map. I strongly recommend it. --------------- 9/10",

The heart of animation is not cheekiness--it is a stylized reality, something we are in danger of losing with the current trend of photo-realistic computer animation and digital \"film\" (though the Final Fantasy trailers show that there are some in the CGI field that still believe in creating fantastic shots, even if the early dialogue screams Titan A.E.).This is not a problem in The Iron Giant, because the filmmakers only draw the giant (and other rotoscoped objects) on computers, then literally paint them (a la \"The Great Mouse Detective\"'s Big Ben scene). The effect is that the computer animation blends well with the traditional cel animation, leaving us in peace to enjoy the beautiful retro-style animation.  Even more important, the story (even with its obvious reference to the X-Files in the form of Kent) stays true to the time they are in, unlike most Disney pictures these days.  This does seemingly make the movie drag, but we are compensated with an atmosphere almost completely devoid of cynicism and mean-spirited irony. This is as close to the feelings of wonder and innocence evoked in E.T. that we are likely to get in animation--save for My Neighbor Totoro, which might be a little too innocent.The only real problems I have with this movie are some glaring and unforgivable continuity errors, exemplified by the filmmakers indecision as to what season the movie should take place in (the movie takes place in less than a week, but we see Hogarth diving into a(n admittedly cold) pond in one scene, then later there is a snowstorm).",

It tells the story of a giant, amnesiac robot who falls to Earth, and is eventually befriended by a local boy, Hogarth Hughes. Hogarth must hide the robot from a paranoid government agent who suspects it a Soviet weapon of war. The truth is that the robot is indeed essentially a giant gun, but hails from a distant planet and bears unbelievable firepower! Ultimately, it is the friendship with the boy that brings out the robot's compassion and humanity, and saves the town from annihilation.I liked this film so much that after I saw it, I emailed everyone on my many contact lists and practically begged them to put on their shoes and hit the theatre to support this amazing film. Why should I care? Because I am an ardent believer in supporting cinematic--or any other--efforts that one feels strongly about. And I do feel strongly about this film. The Iron Giant is one of the finest, well-written, non-formulaic, intelligent pieces of animated film I have seen in a long long time, and I watch a lot of cartoons. At the time, just a few weeks after the film opened, it came to my attention that it was not doing so well at the box office. My bulk email was a modest campaign to boost awareness of the film, because in Hollywood there is just one truth: the success of a movie is based on its gross. If a piece of s**t movie does well, more piece of s**t movies like it will get made. Conversely, if an intelligent, well-written movie does not make its financial mark, that kind of movie will fall out of favour with the fatcats who make the decisions back at the studio. I personally would hate to see the entire genre suffer because The Iron Giant is recognized by a wanting dollar return and lack of ubiquitous Happy Meal tie-in claptrap. The Iron Giant is an inspiring movie that can be appreciated by adults for its genuine characters and solid story (not to mention its welcome lack of ill-placed Disneyesque singalongs) and by children for its well-executed animation and springboard for the imagination. If you can still find The Iron Giant in theatres, go see it (again). If not, it's coming out on video shortly.And if you don't want to take my word for it, I can send you the barrage of reply emails I received, with subject lines like \"Thanks for the great recommendation...I loved Iron Giant.\"",

            "review_title": "Hogarth as Protagonist",
            "content": "In The Iron Giant, I would argue that Hogarth is the protagonist of the film. Simply put, his enacted choices are what drive the plot and develop the overarching theme\u0097hence the film's dictum, \"Your choices make who you are.\" He is introduced to the viewer as an adventurous young boy who relishes at the chance of having a close friendship, even while at the cost of driving his hardworking mother bonkers (like when he chooses to befriend a squirrel).His main objective is to satisfy his need for friendship. The inciting incident that leads him on this journey is when his television short circuits and interrupts his horror film. Committed to find the fiend who stole, or should we say, ate his antenna wire, Hogarth plunges into the forest and discovers the iron giant. When he makes the conscious choice to save the robots life after seeing him entangled in a web of electrical power lines, it is here, whether he realizes it or not, that his once balanced life becomes unbalanced. After all, to befriend the giant is to introduce a heavy weight, both physically and metaphorically, into his life; thus tipping the balancing scale. Hogarth, however, is up for the challenge. His thirst for friendship surpasses the weight of any obstacle that might thwart this desire of his. Soon the giant begins to follow him where ever he goes. Hogarth is now faced with an enormous obstacle\u0097to hide the giant while protecting him from a paranoid government detective. One obstacle after the next, a special bond is created between Hogarth and the giant; one that truly exemplifies the meaning of the word 'friendship.' With Hogarth's continual choice to befriend the giant, the plot is further developed and the audience learns that the giant is much like Hogarth himself\u0097one who has a soul that feels and thinks. This significant plot point may have never been revealed unless there was a character like Hogarth who extended an unprejudiced love towards the giant\u0097a love that seemed to lack in the rest of the city because of their fear of 'otherness.' The audience also learns that the giant is a volitional being who can choose whether to be good like superman, or bad like Atomo. This is revealed, once again, because of Hogarth. With Hogarth's help, the giant learns not to act like a weapon of destruction, but rather as a friend to mankind. This idea is particularly emphasized at the crisis/climax of the film. As Hogarth had originally sacrificed the safety of his life when saving the giant, the giant now returns the favor at the end of the film by sacrificing his life to save both Hogarth and the rest of the city. This you could say is the film's meatball criticism: one who lays down his life for the life of his friend is truly a friend indeed. True friendship is found in sacrifice, not selfishness, be it ever great or small. Is Hogarth's objective obtained? I would say yes, for it is the robot's memory that will forever live in his mind as the best friend he ever had.",

This is probably one of the best cartoons that I have ever seen.  It didn't get a lot of publicity and bombed at the box office.  I can understand what people were thinking though because I didn't want to see it either.  Just because Dreamworks or Disney didn't make the movie, no one wanted to see it.This is a cartoon that actually had morals and wasn't just about singing and entertainment.  It's more of a teen and adult movie than children's movie because children may have a hard time understanding some of the elements of the movie.The voice-overs were great.  Eli Marienthal isn't the best actor but he does a great job in this voice role.  Maybe he should stick to voicing roles because he is very good at them.  Jennifer Aniston is the last person whom you would expect to actually be able to put feeling into a voice-over but she does well too.  Christopher McDonald is perfect as the paranoid army soldier.  He always plays mean jerkish roles anyway so this is really not a change for him.  And Harry Connick Jr. did a pretty decent job, seeing as though he never has had much emotion to his voice.The animation is spectacular as well as the effects.  There is a great story and I wish there were more cartoons like this out there that could teach children lessons while entertaining them.  10 out of 10.",

He first is very scared, but then he realizes the giant has a good heart. So then Hogarth befriends Dean who likes to make art out of metal. Hogarth hides the giant at Dean's house when Hogarth finds out that Mr. Kent Mansley who works for the government wants to destroy the giant because they feel that some country sent him to destroy the world. The Iron Giant likes to eat metal so where they put him was a perfect place for him to hide. Other problems occur between Hogarth and Mr. Mansley because they go through great lengths to kill him. What I thought of this film was that it was very beautiful. I had a tear in my eye when The Iron Giant saw the deer that died and the giant had feelings for it. I also was sad when the giant thought Hogarth was dead. I felt what the giant was going through. I liked the character of the iron giant because he risked his life to help Hogarth because he really loved him. The ending was also very sad because (BIG SPOILERS!!!!) The Iron Giant killed himself. ***1/2",

Is great. No suprise there. A round of applause to the animators of this movie. They captured the 2d-3d animation style really well.The voice acting second of all. Was. Great. It was a bit screechy but other than that. They all did really great.The characters third of all. Are great. Something that i liked about the characters where the fact that they actually acted like their character. Some movies exaggerate stuff like this or dont do it at all. But this movie. It just felt realistic. The 9 year old kid acts like a 9 year old kid. The villain was actually a bad guy. The overprotected mom acted like a overprotected mom etc.Maybe this happens in all movies and im only noticing it now but. YeahThe story. Fourth of all. Was ok. I wouldnt say most original. Especially since this is an adaptation. But i think what matters is that it is well done. And if you've watched this movie. You know how well done it is.Something that people always like to menton about this movie is that it is just so darn sad. For a kids movie! And they are not wrong. But its not only that its sad. Its also a really funny movie at times. Thats something that this movie did really well. Messing with your emotions.Overall. Now i know thats theres no such thing as perfect. But this is one of the closest things to perfect i have watched in awhile.It gets a ... 10/10... Its hard to give something that you cant find any flaws in anything under a 10.The movie is 1 hour and 20 minutes long. Trust me. It's worth watching. I recommend.Thats all.",

            "content": "Warner Brothers was trying to cut it's 1999 losses from the monumental flop \"Wild Wild West\", and ended up putting very little money in the promotion of what may be one of the finest animated features ever made.This is a tragedy, since the film has so much to provide. It is insightful, touching, whimsical, and nostalgic. And there isn't a single musical song-and-dance number or annoying sidekick in sight. The perfect film for the family, including the adults. The kids will associate with young Hogarth, especially if they feel they don't fit in. The adults will appreciate the touches of nostalgia for the 1950's and early 1960's.\nThe animation is top quality. A brilliant fusion of cel and CGI creating a sense of realism and depth that you don't expect from a cartoon. The vocal performances, especially from Harry Connick, Jr., are flawless.My only complaints are the anti-hunting/anti-gun message and the slightly sweet ending that seemed to be written as an obligation. But these can be overlooked when the quality of the work is taken into consideration.Many say that Orson Welles' \"Citizen Kane\" is the finest American film ever made, but it struggled at the box office, and wasn't appreciated for it's genius until many years later. I strongly feel that \"The Iron Giant\" will follow the same path. Years from now, this will be the standard that animated features will be judged by. I can only hope that the support of this film on video this will spark a new interest in animation as a serious media, as \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" spawned a new interest in animation in general. There are a great number of serious animated features produced in Japan, and there is no reason why this cannot happen in the USA.Part fantasy, part morality play, \"The Iron Giant\" is a remarkable work. It didn't get a fare shot at the box office, but it may reach it's intended audience on home video. If you're going to buy the VHS copy, get the widescreen edition. Yes, it IS that good!",

The animation, music and voices are on par with the story. Perhaps the greatest achievement by the animators is making the CGI and traditional animation blend so seamlessly that you forget that the main character is computer-generated.See this film, and see it in its letterbox format to fully see the giant's physical relationship with everything around him.",

I can't explain it, but there was this overwhelming feeling of nostalgia as I watched it. It left me with this bittersweet feeling. I felt loss and sorrow, but it wasn't a negative feeling. It was like having touched the most fragile parts of humanity and realizing those were your parts. I think the feelings were amplified for the time period than the actual content of the movie. It's funny since my parents were just born in the 40s and I wasn't even around. I thought the most touching part was the homage to superman. I thought it was interesting that this alien's desire to emulate a fictional alien made him more human. It was because Superman has always embodied all the very traits that as humans we strive to posess. His desire to be like Superman meant he yearned to be good, although programmed only to do harm.

            "content": "I went to The Iron Giant knowing nothing about it. I did not see any trailers and avoid TV (why watch the boob tube when you can spend the time at the movies?), so I knew only that it was about a giant robot. I have had a thing for giant robots since childhood, which usually results in me going to see crap like \"Robot Jox\". I am also a fan of films that satirize the '50s.The first few minutes of the film established that it was going to be a superbly animated film, if nothing else, although I've seen it twice on two different theatres so far and both time the first scenes in the small town were jerky and out of focus...luckily whatever caused this was not apparent for the remainder of the film. The first minutes up through the scary (for kids) scene at the power distribution center in the woods resulted in many younger kids in the audience screaming to leave the theatre. But then, even they were caught up and were very quiet for the rest of it. PARENTS: this is probably not a good film for kids under 5 years old (empirical observation).Other reviews have pretty well covered the material, but I will highlight what worked for me. 1) anti Disney-formula 2) no songs 3) no cute animals or sidekicks 4) fine artwork 5) inspired storytelling & script 6) straight forward yet dead-on vocal work  from the actors 7) amazing character development for the robot 8) it made me weep from both emotion of the story and joy at the quality 9) the audience was not distracting since they were all totally absorbed in the storytelling 10) great satire on many levelsWhat did I dislike? I hate the simplistic 'guns are evil' concept. The scene where the hunters run off after killing the deer, yet the kid forgets them and instructs the robot that it is the gun on the ground that did the killing. Luckily, the film corrects this later on, establishing that the real problem is with the foolish people who want to shoot anything they don't understand (the robot in this case), while the robot who is clearly designed to be a fearsome weapon is able to gain a soul through his lucky interaction with a totally unprejudiced boy and use himself not as a killing machine but rather as a heroic character. This is one small gripe for one really fine film.",

It's become such a cliche that kids aren't being entertained like they used to (don't fear TARZAN, though, a wonderful movie).I knew I was going to enjoy this movie's retro 50s-like animation immensely, but I was surprised how much more I enjoyed. The movie isn't concerned how life-like the characters are, because ultimately it's the actions that make them more realistic than how they appear.Eli Marienthal's voice is incredibly convincing as the young boy Hogarth and the title robot is the most enjoyable and friendly creature to watch since E.T. almost twenty years ago. The Iron Giant is voiced with mechanical authenticity by Vin Diesel who marvelously makes the audience not only believe but love and sympathize for this colossal metal man. There are also good (voice)performances by Harry Connick Jr. (who sounds like a cajun Bruce Willis here) and Christopher McDonald (who I was convinced was Tim Allen). One of the great moments are when Hogarth teaches his new mechanical buddy about Superman, and the Iron Giant decides he wants to be a hero.It is almost inevitable for a movie like this not to have a message, but the great thing is that not only is it a good and heartwarming message, but it isn't handed to us in a heavy and literal way. Guns are bad and they are only used for killing. Near the end I almost felt ashamed that I was starting to get a bit misty.

So the story starts out with this little kid who is watching movies at night he hears a noise and well finds the Iron Giant and he saves him. This story is great because through out it this will show how the boy and the giant really care for one another.The Iron Giant only wants to be a super-hero like Superman but people in the 50's hell people now in days will freak out and the government will try and kill it and experiment on it. This brings a lot of heart to the story on one end it is a giant monster film yet on another end it is a story about an outcast who is just trying to figure out who he is.At the end of this movie you truly get to see how bad-ass the Iron Giant really is he could've been a unstoppable monster but since he has the boy he is the likable giant. This may not be everyone but this movie gets emotional at the end I teared up it has such a good ending beginning it is a must see.

What I saw was a wonderful event of animation, with plenty of depth and imagination.Animation has come a long way from the days of the old Looney Tunes and Disney cartoons, and now with The Iron Giant we have a seamless merging between traditional 2D animation and 3D animation, with the Giant being fully animated in 3D.  The result was the most visually stunning animation I have seen in a while.The Iron Giant had a great story to it (being based on the book by Ted Hughes), one that was meaningful and one that allowed interaction with the viewer to use their imagination (there are questions which are not answered, you really have to use your imagination).  All the voice performances were exceptional, and really added to the characters in the film, instead of making them one-dimensional.  The Giant in particular had a lot more emotion then you'd expect from a giant robot made from iron.This is the best animated film I have seen since The Lion King, it had everything in it, from laughter to drama, from happiness to sadness (the ending brought tears to my eyes).  This is an animated feature not only for kids, but for anyone of any age.  It's a shame it wasn't given the exposure it deserved, it probably would have done a lot better at the box office.  If you're a fan of animation, or you just want to see a great family film, you have to see this.  I give it 10/10.",

I forgot to mention two of my favourite scenes in the movie.  One is when Paranoia-stricken and completely insufferable Government entity  Kent Mansley appears on the scene of a chomped-up transformer substation. After a few infuriatingly condescending remarks to the locals and jotting a few scathing remarks into a tiny notebook, he gets into his car to drive off, presumably to find the \"Big Stuff\" he was only just so helpfully (?) explaining to the locals. ** It's at this point that he discovers exactly half the passenger side of his vehicle has been bitten off and he jumps 10 feet or so out the driver's door, producing a noise that sounded a lot like \"ohmyGOD!!!!\"Before he can make a coherent further statement the rest of the car disappears, apparently meeting an identical fate (the Giant must have been a bit peckish at the time). ** The other was when the Giant imitates Hogarth's rather unimpressive \"Banzai!\" leap into the lake and, of course, causes a fair-sized tidal wave. ** I happened to notice Dean McCoppin, sitting on a bench behind the inevitable newspaper, was still sitting in, and holding onto, his bench while being tumbled round by the water and watching an intersting display of fish swim by. ** He finally lands in the middle of he road, looking rather like a drowned cat.  A truck pulls up just then and a brief exchange ensues:\"Hey!\"  Without turning his head Dean looks askance at the truck driver and says carefully: \"Yeah?\" The driver then says, somewhat unnecessarily, \"You're sitting in the middle of the road!\" Without moving even slightly Dean again answers identically, except with considerably more force: \"YEAH??\"  At which point the driver mutters \"Allright...\" and drives off. ** The second time I saw this scene I cracked up laughing.

I too can enjoy a Disney movie but probably wouldn't be able to sit through a marathon of them.  The Iron Giant was different.  The language was harsher then a lot of cartoons but nothing that wouldn't be aired on TV, this didn't shock me but I watch a lot of animated films where this stuff is nothing compared to what I've heard said in them.  The animation is nice and smooth, and the characters act realistic enough.  Most of the humor wasn't very deep but still made me laugh in many scenes.  One of the things I didn't like about this movie was then fact that the antiwar message was imposed a little to strong around the end.  Also showing that the films that tell you to duck and cover during a nuclear attack will have no chance of protecting you.  Still it's overall a good movie and would recommend it to anyone.My review 8 out of 10.",

Jennifer Aniston as Annie, Harry Connick, Jr., and Eli Marienthal all portray their parts as people as opposed to just actors reading lines.The animation is fine, although I've seen better, but it captures the period well enough. There are a couple of plot holes--mainly about the Giant managing to keep hidden so well when he is a, well, giant--but the movie is so gripping and the music moving (and a little maudlin at times) that you just can't help getting caught up in it.Highly recommended.",

The outline of this story is clear and ordinary, but it will not let you down at any moment. Due to its almost perfect continuity and obvious but not boring plot, it is easy for children to follow and to wet their eyes, especially when our iron giant said \"Superman\" and then took care the bomb; just like the plot in \"How to Train Your Dragon\" (2010), it is a sacrifice in the end, however, everything will be fine at the final end.Furthermore, with this simple story which is logical but not novel, \"The Iron Giant\" really teaches us something. The unknown things are always considered dangerous and scared, it is absurd and what the author wants to throw down by this film. When Hogarth helped the iron giant to get rid of the electric cable, the next day our giant show him the friendly. \"Him, not it\", said by a little boy shows us a warm world although it is frozen winter in the film. \"He is like a baby\", when he is hungry, he has only iron in his mind, when he find it is interesting to jump into the water, he plays like a children; \"You are not him (the machine killer), you are like superman\", just like teaching a child, good teaching grows up a reasonable boy.Finally, the most worth thinking about is \"guns kill\", is this a enlightenment telling giant you are a gun of killing, wake up, or a word to tell him do not be the gun killing innocence, even though you possess the power. Actually, clues for both of them can be found, but of course, the later one is what the film wants to say.Just an cute animation, too much thinking for it...... LoL!",

Intelligent writing, comedy that is actually funny, and a strong message all come together to create a good film experience.  The film loses its way a bit at the end by going a little too over the top with the boy's relationship with the giant, but otherwise it is even-handed and emotionally restrained.The best part of the film is that it is not afraid to state its political beliefs.  The Cold War was a waste of people's lives and times.  The boy is fatherless, in fact, because he was a pilot who died in Korea (we can assume).  The methods that our government provided us for protection were all lies, such as the Duck and Cover film that must be seen to be believed. Best of all, the film is strongly anti-gun.  The giant, like all of us in our insane country, can be a gun.  He chooses not to be and chooses not to hurt others.  It is a choice we can all make by saying no to guns and gun violence.  The military and government officals suffer some well-deserved put-downs, and the hero's friend is a subversive beatnik artist.  What could be better than that?  The real reason that Warner is not promoting this film is that it fears that its strong political message could create a backlash against the company.  Instead, they put their money into Wild Wild West and its humor based on race and disability. Better to reaffirm those who hate than encourage us to love.",

I have to admit, I had my doubts when I first learned of the movie. After all, The Iron Giant? Will this movie even be good? How ignorant was I to even have these thoughts. Little did I know I was about to indulge in what may have been the best 2 hours and 21 minutes of my life. The movie started out strong. The opening scenes enticed the audience with a captivating enigma. I was so taken aback from the next-generation animation that I almost didn't even realize the underlying symbolism in the ongoing scenes. It wasn't until my twenty sixth viewing of the movie where I finally got my bearings together and was able to focus on the gripping and labyrinthine stratagem. The underlying analogy for 19th century distopianism and the evangelical deviation of typical orthodoxy was enlightening to say the least. Just when I thought the movie could not get any better, the increasing conflict before the climax began. I could not believe the complexity of the story as the main bee protagonist, Bellza, struggled with the everyday endeavors for a quintessential bee such as the consistent up- hill altercation of the fight against misogyny and the fiscal synergy of opposing interplanetary dynamisms. There I was, gripping to my chair as the conflict of the movie began. I was so enticed by the movie that I felt as if I was both practically and relatively apart of the movie. This is a special kind of high that not even the strongest of drugs can give you. Was I part of the movie? Am I inside the movie right now? This movie will leave you questioning existential nihilism and the objective skepticism of our perceived valuation of anthropological existence. At this point in the film, I was fully intoxicated by the avant-garde animated art style. That's when the plot finally aggrandized and I was completely stupefied. You could have lived a thousand years of isolation trying to predict the plot twist and you would never even scratch the surface of what actually transpires in the movie. I was so bewildered that I actually had to pause the movie so that my existential crisis didn't dive too deep inside of myself. Even pausing the movie was surreal. It's almost as if life paused with the movie. I felt as though I had actually become a cinematic tangent quantum. The effects are still wearing off and I haven't been able to watch the movie in several years. I spent the following seven years afraid of what outside of my house actually looks like. Every single day and night I live in misery because I became fully aware that happiness is never achievable. I realized that human life has absolutely no meaning and that no matter what I ever do, it is of complete unimportance and in years from now, no recollection of my existence will prevail, meaning that if I died years ago, died now, or die sometime in the future it will not matter whatsoever to anyone. But, then again, the fact that I'm living doesn't matter either so I might as well stick around for awhile, living in complete isolation, condemned to a life of traumatic memories and a completely corrupted sub-conscience. The Iron Giant literally ruined my life. 10/10",

Like Toy Story, it keeps you engrossed in a simple, but engaging narrative by animation that actually augments, rather than detracts, from the story. Possibly most compelling, for me at least, it manages to transport you into the paranoid yet somehow rarefied atmosphere of the Cold War, much as the 1993 film Matinee did.I had prepared myself for the worst - stillborn plots, offensive characters, embarrassingly inappropriate musical numbers, etc. a la Disney.  When I walked out of the Iron Giant, I found myself wondering how they managed to do everything so *right* when so many other animated films get it so wrong. In fact, this is really the only good animated kids' film since Toy Story (and woe unto us when Toy Story II comes out).As a professed gun nut, I would have expected to find the movie's anti-gun message objectionable.  That wasn't even remotely the case.  The gun thing was only the toe-nail to the greater issue of self-determination, and the deliberate sacrifices that one must make to choose the path of heroism, rather than destruction.  That point is made poignant because ???spoiler??? .....................the Giant is a destroyer by nature.I also couldn't get over the way the movie made me wonder why it is so hard in film to stay away from violence when striving for heroism.  It seems that every hero has a mean streak, or is eventually forced to violence by the bad guys; for once I had no reservations explaining to my son the Giant's motivations for doing what he did.Finally, I hope that everyone sees this film.  It deserves better than it will get, and we deserve more good stuff like it.   It's not every day that you can look at the viewer reviews and see that *every* one is positive. That speaks volumes.",

            "content": "I've just watched the DVD version of \"Iron Giant.\"   I found the story line to be one of the most cliche' plots in all of animation.   There is an obvious anti-gun message that is rather silly and ineffective.   Then there's the all too familiar \"kid without a father\" theme that Hollywood beats like a dead horse.    Hardly the sort of stuff that makes for a great film.   But, worst of all, it is filled with logical and factual errors that stretch the already thin credibility of animated flicks.Despite all that, I just loved this movie!Of all the films I've seen in 1999, this is definitely the best of the lot-- animated or live action.   And I say this just having seen \"Toy Story 2\" a few weeks back, which is now my second favorite film of '99.  \"Iron Giant\" kicked it out of first place.   (You know it's a bad year for movies when your top two favorites are animations...)   Flaws and all, this film has more heart and emotion than any other 10 Hollywood films of 1999 combined.The film takes place during 1957.  We have a story about a boy named Hogarth (without a father, of course...) who finds a giant iron robot from outer space while searching the woods for invaders from Mars.   After being initially scared to death of the creature, he quickly realizes the robot is not out to harm him- and so, in short order, the boy befriends him.   The rest of the movie deals with the boy's efforts to hide a 100ft. tall robot from the local townspeople of Rockwell, Maine and the United States government.While there's nothing cliche' about a boy taking a walk in the woods and discovering a huge metallic robot suffering from amnesia munching on the local electric power plant, the \"...boy meets awesomely powerful yet benign creature and quickly befriends him while everyone else wants to kill him...\" plot has been done too many times to count.    Yet the film's writers, directors and animators take us down this well-traveled path in such a way that new life is breathed into this most ancient of fairy tales.   For that feat alone, the movie is deserves every drop of praise it gets.The film is a parable of the atomic age.   The fears and paranoias of the time are summed up in the government agent sent out to find the giant robot, \"Kent Mansly.\"   He's a walking, talking tribute to the \"red under every bed\" mindset.    The innocent and fun loving target of his paranoia, the boy Hogarth, contrasts Mansly.   Hogarth is about the best portrayal of a red blooded 50's era American boy that's ever been put to screen, despite the fact that he's a simple drawing.\"Iron Giant\" should not be mistaken for a mere kid's flick.    Parents will like it as much if not more than their children.   The message of the film is one of love and self-sacrifice, the kind of thing most of us want to instill in our kids.  In it's own way, \"Iron Giant' is a kind of \"Saving Private Ryan\" for children.Ultimately, this is a love story between a boy and his robot.   Yes, it sounds silly, but you'll have to see it yourself to understand how the writers & directors pull it off.  There is a moral to this film, or I should say, \"morals.\"  The morals are not heavy handed or preached, but they are expounded upon by the actions of the characters themselves.   My favorite lesson had to do with  \"peace through superior fire power!\"But don't take my word for how good it is. My four-year-old son watched the DVD three times in a 24-hour period, and watched it every day we had it for the seven-day rental period.  I believe it's now his new favorite film.  We judge how much he likes a film by the amount of times he asks to see it again.    The last movie he wanted to watch as much as this one is \"A Bug's Life.\"Interesting note: \"Iron Giant,\" along with \"Toy Story 2,\" both pay homage to good old \"Sputnik\" -the first ever satellite launched into earth's orbit. It's neat how these two rather unrelated stories both deal with the significance of that event.Don't bother renting this film.   Just buy it the next time you see it on sale.   We've already decided to make the \"Iron Giant\" DVD a permanent part of our collection.",

The Iron Giant is a notable exception:  the animation, storyline, direction, characters, and voices are superb.

By keeping the number of core characters to a minimum, the film-makers allow us to learn about the players and see their personalities unfold without resorting to cheap dialogue tricks.  Despite being animated, the characters seem real (my oldest asked me if it was a true story - a previously unheard of question about an ANIMATED film).There are few other animated films which captivate my children in this way.

I liked the flawed but enjoyable \"Quest for Camelot\", (hadn't seen the WB animated \"King and I\", was that movie any good?) but \"Iron Giant\" is now the one to best.  The story involves a young boy named Hogarth Hughes (voiced by Eli Marienthal) who likes science-fiction, late night movies and MAD magazine, and later, befriends a 100-foot tall, metal munching machine, and needs keep him safe from those may report him.  Meanwhile, Agent Kent Mansley (Christopher McDonald) is aware of a giant metal beast and believes it might be a threat (designed by who?  The Chinese?  The Russians?  Martians? Who?)It's not a silly little kids' movie.  It's one the whole family will grow into liking.  Also, I can't picture Disney making this movie, at least, not w/o (some or any of) the following: retro '50's stuff (ie. sock hops), Hogarth wanting to hide the giant and impress a girl he has a crush on, Hogarth having an obligatory comic relief in the form of a pet (his mom doesn't want one) and presence of heart.  All current Disney movies seem to have all of the first three, but none of the last one. \nWhat angers me, though, is the fact this movie bombed at the box office.  I hate it whenever an animated flick bombs just because it seems like the only reason being is it wasn't made by either Disney or DreamWorks.  Maybe if only a LITTLE bit more advertising was put in...However, I contain boasting rights to this movie.  In August of 1999, I could've been a sucker for hype and Happy Meals.  I COULD'VE seen the snoozefest \"Blair Witch Project\".  I COULD'VE paid for that Happy Meal disaster \"Disney's Inspector Gadget\".  What did I pay for?  WB's \"The Iron Giant\".  And I know I got my money's worth.  If you haven't seen it, my suggestion is to buy it.Rating: 12 out of 10",

I urge everybody who hasn't seen it to go see it immediately.  Probably the most moving film I've ever seen.  The ending ranks right up there with the endings of \"Sling Blade\" and \"One False Move\" for pure emotional power.  When the movie ended, I looked around and saw people everywhere in the audience dabbing their eyes.  On the way out of the theater, a father and his six year old son walked hand in hand.  The father was using his other hand to wipe tears from his cheeks.  That in itself speaks volumes for this movie.  Despite this being animation, it's a film for everybody.

            "content": "After the release of Toy Story in 1995, 3-D animation took over, and 2-D animation slowly began to fade...which is a shame, because one of the 2-D films that got over shadowed was the 1999 film, \"The Iron Giant\". Not only is it an animated masterpiece, it is one of my favorite films of all time. Whenever I bring it up in a conversation (even to this day), people have no idea what I'm talking about; which is unacceptable. So what do I love about this film? Well....everything. I love the 1950's setting, I love how it pays homage to the atomic age of cinema, I love the characters, I love the emotion, I love adult tone to it, I love the music, the animation, the message, and...I love that it's not Disney. This movie has such a natural and balanced build to it, that I don't think most Disney films at the time could achieve. Everything about this movie just feels very natural, and the characters act/react in a way that feels real, and not so cartoon like. The emotions this film conveys are also very natural, and doesn't seem to go overboard. Most Disney films of the 90's had moments where the film was telling you \"Feel sad here\", or \"laugh now\". \"The Iron Giant\" has sad moments and funny moments, but they're not shoved in your face. \"The Iron Giant\" didn't have any musical numbers, cute little animals, or an over the top comic relief, but so what? To me, those kinds of things dumb down the film (not always) and weakens it in the long run. \"The Iron Giant\" didn't need any of those kid movie gimmicks; and the result is a kids movie that gets better with age. It's a shame that this movie didn't get the same attention as films like \"The Lion King\" or \"Beauty and the Beast\", because to me, it really is one of the best 2-D animated films of all time. it is highly underrated, i highly recommend it, check it out.",

            "content": "On The Iron Giant video box is an excerpt from The Tuscon Citizen movie reviewer: \"The best animated film of the decade...\". I wholeheartedly agree. Problem is, why doesn't the rest of America? The film apparently grossed one sixth of Toy Story's gross and, as a more expensive film than Toy Story, its profits amount to far less than its cost to make - i.e. it lost money.This film's lack of popularity is the same as the lack of popularity of Columbia Tristar's Indian in the Cupboard. The underlying cause of this is found in the fact that, unlike Toy Story, Star Wars etc., Iron Giant and Indian In the Cupboard are films with more intelligence than pizzazz, consequently causing the mainstream public to not be as interested in patronizing them into blockbusters. Neither film is difficult for any child over the age of 5 to understand. It's just that films that are even the least bit intelligent cause them to achieve the IQ of a book, and that translates to box office failure. Never mind that The Iron Giant is in a league of the greatest films ever made; it's just not cute or cool enough for profitable merchandising.Within this fact lies the nutshell of the problem with American entertainment. That is, basically there's not enough respect for intelligence. The film industry is not to be entirely blamed, however, like junk food chains are not entirely responsible for American obesity. For if the people are too stupid to know what's good for them, one may rest assured that someone will come along selling what's bad for them, and they will promptly eat it up. America is Pinocchio and certain of Hollywood's producers are the sly fox & company who lead Pinocchio to the children's prison hiding behind a carnival front. But the Iron Giant - he thinks he's Superman, and he really is this time. That is, his movie is really a saving grace in a tide of less intelligent fare. In terms of Pinocchio, this 100 foot robot is America's fairy queen.That said, I should say what's so good about this film. Problem is, there's so much that I don't know where to begin. This is one of those animation films, like Cats Don't Dance, that uses animation's strengths - such as that it doesn't have to rely on live actors, sets, lighting etc. - to its greatest potential. There isn't a single second of dead space in the entire film. Moreover, the script is impeccable and, as the opening page reviewer eloquently stated (read it; it's a fine, poignant review), what's left out of the story line is a boon for the audience's imagination. This only works if the script is good & adequately performed. It is, with exceptional attention payed to timing and witty dramatic effects. Not special effects, mind you - this is animation, and it doesn't need those. I'm talking dramatic effects, such as hints at plot twists, perfectly hip slapstick set-ups that aren't dumb & dumber like so many Jim Carrey bits, intelligent jokes & asides on religion, morality, nationalism, the beatnik culture, the science fiction comic strip genre so popular in the 50s (which is the setting for the movie), and many characterizations, all perfectly realized and all of which entertain & bring the audience into the action and keep us happily interested and wondering what's next. This is a definition of fine drama; it works in any of the dramatic genres, and it is undeniably what every intelligent human being desires from dramatic entertainment. In my humble opinion, the producers of this film thus understand the most basic, important elements of drama, and are therefore rare geniuses of dramatic production, on the level with Shakespeare, Rogers & Hart, you name it; even the music was as finely orchestrated and whimsically placed in cues as Bernstein, Copland & Stravinsky would have accomplished.Indeed, everything in this film was better than anything one should have expected from a children's animation feature. This apparent mis-match was surely its death warrant at the box office. But once again, time will reveal the true genius from the flash in the pan. The Iron Giant is a supreme classic, the product of film making geniuses. Its sentimentality made me cry, its fable made me rejoice, its subtle slapstick left me grinning and, perhaps most importantly, it allowed me to attend a film, and later many video replays, with my young son without having to feel that I was taking my son to some tawdry carnival that would lower his intelligence & impress upon him low expectations of humanity. If all American children's films were this good, America would truly be the great nation it is cracked up to be.",

The Iron Giant is an example of animated cinema at its best - Warner Brothers did not resort to cheesey characters, corney gimmics, and trite characters, instead they created a wonderful, whimsical storyline about everyones boyhood fantasy, which can be related to by anyone of any age.  I am not going to bother repeating the same accolades which people before me have posted, all I will say is that The Iron Giant is unlike any animated film I have ever seen, and it deserves the attention of even the most mature and jaded of movie-goers!

It's really unfortunate too, because The Iron Giant is one of the few movies of recent years that is great for kids.Blending traditional cel animation with a completely digital character (the Giant), this movie is a feast for the eyes.  The story, while simple, contains so many levels that both children and adults will find something of interest.  Children will react to the story of a small boy with a robot for a pal, while adults will see how the movie mocks the Cold War paranoia of the 50's.There are no musical numbers.  There are no talking bears or raccoons.  Just a good story that is backed up with excellent animation and a big heart. This movie is one of the best animated movies of the decade, and hopefully audiences will discover it on video.",

It gives us a fresh and innovative view of the McCarthy era, when paranoia dictated politics and fear motivated overwhelmed our sense of responsibility and accountability.By framing the story as a cartoon and presenting it to us from the point of view of a child, the viewer is able to judge the other characters objectively for what they are. The naivete of Hogarth and the seeming innocence of the plot is a stark contrast to the probing cynicism and paranoia of the CIA.The movie does indeed oversimplify some major issues to make its point. The Iron Giant, as a symbol of ultimate good, and the CIA as the symbol of pure evil is certainly unfair. The rigid binary of good/evil, right/wrong is problematic. But it nevertheless forces us to ask questions about ourselves and about how we take the authority of those who claim to be looking out for our best interests.The Iron Giant is a refreshing tale of moral accountability and a brilliant social commentary on a dark time in American history",

The story is the well tread \"child befriends outsider\" plot, mixing E.T. with Short Circuit in roughly equal amounts.  But the presentation here is top notch.  None of the characters, not even the bad guy, are distorted caricatures. They're all human, believable and very well voiced.  Even the robot, despite his fantastic nature is believable as a character too.  And a very likable one at that.  Despite his size and mechanical form, he is very emotive.  His gentle nature even helps drive home the point of the movie that those which we are told are dangerous are not necessarily so. Violence, fear of the unknown, tolerance, friendship, sacrifice and more are all presented for your consideration with a grace and subtlety Disney would do well to study.  I can't even recall a Disney film in years being brave enough to take on some of the subjects explored in this film.  And it's still fun enough to entertain young children.  A couple of scenes made me laugh harder than I've laughed in a theater in a long time, only to be followed by a thought provoking moment that didnt' feel at all disjoint from the rest of the film. I saw this film when it first came out, and saw its brilliance immediately. I was terribly disappointed when Warner Bros. gave it such short shrift when it looked like it might not draw the kind of crowds Disney features get. Some supposedly savvy people there should be ashamed that they could not see this for what it was.  But I suppose it is not the people who \"know\" films that make those sorts of decisions, unfortunately.A visually appealing, well acted, stunning film.",

            "content": "Animation today seems to be focused on grabbing the attention of both children and adults.  The fact is most kids going to see a movie are going to see it with their parents, so it makes sense.  There are pop culture references, and jokes strewn about movies that fly over the kids heads, but keep the adults entertained while struggling through the movie.  But as of late I've found that all the kids get out of the movie is funny looking characters doing funny looking things, and all of the dialogue is centered on the adults.  The reason for this is the idea that kids don't get it. Some movie makers think that movies with adult themes will be too much for the child, and in turn stupify the movie.  Once this is done they have to fill it up with silly references and jokes that the parents will like.  The end result is a less than entertaining film.  Then there are the movies that say \"screw it all\" and actually focus on making a good animated feature. The Secret of Nimb and The Black Cauldron, and now The Iron Giant are each excellent examples of this.  The makers of these movies give the kids a chance to get what the movie is trying to say, and the kids do.  The political undertones of the Iron Giant may not be something that the kids will relate to and say \"oh look, a cold war metaphore\" but they understand the story and plot, possibly better than those who see what this is all based on. Too add to everything, the animation in this film is fantastic.  Great film all around.",

            "review_title": "One of my Favorite Movies Ever.",
            "content": "I was probably 12 the last time I saw it. After work I saw it on the animation/kids DVD section at Target for 5 dollars. So I picked it up, remembering that I enjoyed it and thought it'd be a nice addition to my DVD collection. And now I can say that it is definitely in my top 5 favorite animated films, and one of my favorite movies ever.As a kid, I loved the whole idea of a little kid running into a gigantic alien robot and having to keep him a secret, very similar to E.T., except Hogarth's alien friend is over 50 feet tall and difficult to keep secret. When I saw it back then on VHS, I enjoyed it just as much as any other animated movie I liked at the time. But I didn't really grasp how wonderful the film truly was because I didn't fully understand what truly makes a movie great. It was a cartoon, so I didn't take it seriously as watching \"Lord of the Rings\" with my dad for the first time, and treated it as such: a good, fun animated movie, but not on par with something \"live-action\" and \"teen/adult oriented\". Now having watched it again at the age of 21, there is so much this film does, so simply and subtly in fact, that it is basically perfect.You already know the synopsis for the film, but what about the characters in the film? The best thing about all of these characters, Hogarth, his mom Annie, the agent Kent, the junkyard artist Dean, and of course the Iron Giant. The relationships between these characters are so enjoyably real and seamless, their personalities meshing, connecting, and clashing as they interact with one another. Hogarth's relationship with his mom seems like a very real mother/son relationship, and the fact that he doesn't have a dad isn't shoved in your face like most Disney movies would with dead parents not being present. It very subtly presented with a brief picture of his dad on a picture frame towards the end of the film, but by then you've already got the picture that he only has a mom and why. And the fact Kent is so hellbent on finding the \"giant\" and is constantly prying Hogarth's brain to get him to spill the beans is just hilarious at times. Hogarth absolutely does not like this guy, and has a very funny way of getting back at Kent, which I won't ruin for you. With Dean and Annie, you don't get any forced, \"this is awkward, kind of like you but can't say it\" scenes, in fact you don't see them together too much, but any moment you see them together, you can tell that they have a genuine attraction towards the other. Last but certainly not least is Hogarth and the Giant.Hogarth runs into the giant out of sheer curiosity as to what took their satellite disk one night, and is obviously terrified and yet memorized at first. Eventually he has to save the giant from being shocked to death from being tangled in some power lines but shutting the power down at the station. He loses track of the robot after that night, but decides he wants to go out an try to capture evidence that there really is a gigantic alien robot in the woods. Sure enough he runs right into him, and so their friendship begins. And through simply trying to teach him to speak and trying to lead him to a safe hiding place, you see that the giant is actually something of a curious little kid, learning and adjusting to this new world. You know he came from some faraway advanced planet, but we really don't know why or what things he is capable of (until towards the end), but you're just so drawn into how through so few words and sentences, this Iron Giant is such a wonderful character.Brad Bird and everyone who took part making this film truly put a genius effort into bringing the giant to life. Through his limited facial expressions (eyebrows, small-big bright eyes, adjustable mouth and iron teeth) and voice work by Vin Diesel, they truly make you feel for this curious, little kid \"giant\", and the personal turmoils he has when comprehended the death of a deer, or whether or not he has a soul of his own because he has a personality and feelings. My personal favorite scene is when the giant thinks Hogarth is dead, how he gasps in shock, how his hand trembles after touching his limp body, how he just starts to whimper and cover his face in sadness, it's just perfect. The Iron Giant himself is one of the best animated characters in history, with a team of amazing artists behind him to turn a what might have otherwise been a generic robot into a genuine, connectible, and memorable character.Ultimately the moral in the end is \"killing is bad, and take time to love what you have around you always.\" People bash this film so badly for the fact that it's a robot and should not have feelings, and all the political references and connections it has in this film, and I do not believe that's any reason to bash it whatsoever. I could go on scene by scene narrating the movie and explaining what I love about each scene, but I want to let you all watch it for yourself.The Iron Giant is a solid 10/10 for me, with amazing animation, wonderful and lush characters with supreme voice actors, such as Jennifer Anniston as Annie or Harry Connick Jr. as Dean, and a simple easy to follow story that is pieced and scripted together so well, that it just comes out perfectly. As I said before, one of my favorite movies ever, and for many a good reason.10/10",

            "content": "Imagine \"E.T.\" as a towering metal man, and you have some of the appeal of \"The Iron Giant,\" an enchanting animated feature about a boy who makes friends with a robot from outer space. The giant crash-lands on a 1957 night when America is peering up at the speck of Sputnik in the sky, and munches his way through a Maine village, eating TV antennas and cars, until he finds a power plant. That's where young Hogarth Hughes finds him.Hogarth is a 9-year-old who lives with his single mom (Jennifer Aniston) and dreams of having a pet. She says they make too much of a mess around the house, little dreaming what a 100-foot robot can get up to. One night Hogarth discovers their TV antenna is missing and follows the Iron Giant's trail to the power plant, where he saves the robot from electrocution after it chomps on some live wires. That makes the giant his friend forever, and now all Hogarth has to do is keep the robot a secret from his mom and the federal government.\"The Iron Giant\" is still another example of the freedom that filmmakers find in animation: This would have been a $100 million live-action special-effects movie, but it was made for a fraction of that cost because the metal man is drawn, not constructed. And here is a family movie with a message: a Cold War parable in which the Iron Giant learns from a little boy that he is not doomed to be a weapon because \"you are what you choose to be.\" The movie is set in the 1950s because that's the decade when science fiction seemed most preoccupied with nuclear holocaust and invaders from outer space. It includes a hilarious cartoon version of the alarming \"Duck and Cover\" educational film, in which kids were advised to seek shelter from H-bombs by hiding under their desks. And the villain is a Cold Warrior named Kent Mansley (voice by Christopher McDonald), a G-man who of course sees the Iron Giant as a subversive plot and wants to blast it to pieces.That political parable is buried beneath a lot of surface charm; the film's appeal comes from its \"E.T.\"-type story about a boy trying to hide an alien from his mom. The Iron Giant is understandably too big to conceal in the closet, but there's a funny sequence where Hogarth brings the creature's hand into the house, and it scampers around like a disobedient dog.Like the new Japanese animated films, \"The Iron Giant\" is happy to be a \"real movie\" in everything but live action. There are no cute little animals and not a single musical number: It's a story, plain and simple. The director, Brad Bird, is a \"Simpsons\" veteran whose visual look here, much more complex than \"The Simpsons,\" resembles the \"clear line\" technique of Japan's Hayao Miyazaki (\"My Neighbor Totoro\"). It works as a lot of animation does, to make you forget from time to time that these are moving drawings, because the story and characters are so compelling.As for the Iron Giant himself, he's surprisingly likable. He can't speak English at first, but is a quick study, and like E.T. combines great knowledge with the naivete of a stranger in a puzzling land. His voice is by Vin Diesel and sounds like it has been electronically lowered. He looks unsophisticated--something like a big Erector Set construction with a steam-shovel mouth--but as we get to know him he turns into a personality before our very eyes--a big lunk we feel kind of sorry for. By the big climax (which, also like \"E.T.,\" involves a threat from bureaucrats and technocrats), we're hoping Hogarth can help save his friend once again.It must be tough to get a movie like this made. Disney has the traditional animation market locked up, but other studios seem willing to throw money at Disney musical look-alikes (like \"The King and I\") even though they might have a better chance moving in the opposite direction--toward real stories told straight. \"The Iron Giant,\" based on a book by the recently deceased British poet laureate Ted Hughes, is not just a cute romp but an involving story that has something to say.",

Only one parent, dreams of a being from outer space coming to earth and being his only friend and influence. Being the center of attention as an only child. The Giant and his way of getting inside of you and wanting him to be only yours. A true friend to be sure. I was swept up in this film in about 10 minutes. I was Hogarth. I felt everything he felt.

The way they animated the robot is pretty good, the movements (sometimes being clumsy, like not being really sure how to fit in the surroundings), the voice, the fact that it barely talks, and just open his mouth to say something relevant.Overall, I think this one is a pretty good family movie, that I think adults can also enjoy (I am on my 30s), because besides of being fun and funny, touches some topics such as how we are scared of what we don't know and tend to judge before even giving us the chance to get to know something or someone.

It's insulting, tiresome, and downplays the effectiveness of art come to life. Here you simply never feel that way; the story and characters are put first, not some self-righteous posturing done 1,000 times before.

This is one of those rare films that I can watch over and over and during certain scenes I still feel a wave of emotion overcome me.  The backdrop for this movie, the last 1950s, makes me long for a world where the Internet is not king, where there isn't a McDonalds and a Starbucks on every corner, where our kids aren't jammed into schools with 4,000 other kids on a regular basis, where crime isn't the standard instead of the exception.  This movie does almost everything right.  It tells an incredible story, and while certain messages can come across too heavy handed for my tastes, such as the references to guns, 99.5% of this movie is perfection in every way.  I've seen some people complain about the use of foul language in this movie, to which I say to these people to realize that to wake up, foul language is a part of life, and the more you ban your kids from it, the more they'll use it when you're not around (Yes, your kids.).  This movie was a complete and utter failure at the box office, which is nothing if not a travesty and a slap in the face to good, hard working animation houses while we keep dropping $8 a pop to see fluff like Lilo and Stitch and countless sequels to Disney movies in which the originals weren't very good in the first place.  People treat movies like Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and Toy Story like some sort of gods of animated features, while Iron Giant surpasses them all in every way. Will we ever see Iron Giant on an Imax screen though?  No, Imax is apparently reserved for second rate mainstream junk like Fantasia 2000. It's sad that we live in a society where fans of \"Walker, Texas Ranger\" are the norm, and where a few lightly sprinkled 4-letter words can take an increidible movie into the dumper.  If you have never seen Iron Giant, you owe it to yourself to experience it, not from the eyes of a religious zealot who only sees the world as church, car washes and private christian academies, but from the eyes of an American, someone who loves the world and takes everything in life as a challenge instead of trying to whittle away the \"bad\" things.",

Though I was too young to be hearing the mild swearing in this film, it still cracked me up.THE IRON GIANT is set in the late 1950's in Maine and focuses on a 9-year-old boy named Hogarth, whose mother is a waitress at a diner. Hogarth is just at home while Mom is working the late shift when he uncovers something in the woods: a giant robot-like figure with its food source being metal. Hogarth meets the giant again and the two become friends. But everything out of the ordinary (and outta this world) always attracts the U.S. Government. Throughout the film Hogarth must try his best keeping his new friend a secret from everyone else, keep it safe from an annoying government agent who happens to have rented a room in Hogarth's house, and teach the Giant itself about humanity and how important life is.THE IRON GIANT is a great movie for any generation for any movie night when nothing's on. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to watch a great cartoon with its own humorous filled-with-adventure plot.",

But what shines is the writing.  Brad Bird and Tim McCanlies have produced what may possibly be the best screenplay ever written for an animated feature film.  As good as a few of the Disney features have been, and as good as Fox's recent ANASTASIA was, this is better.  Add a solid, effortlessly smooth ensemble of voice performances, and you have a story that viewers will remember and return to with pleasure.Look for THE IRON GIANT on awards ballots -- and not just for animated films or SF movies.

            "content": "At the preview for \"The Iron Giant\", my kids could barely hold their excitement.  They've seen the commercials and knew several of the characters already.  In advance, I had warned them that there weren't any sidekicks or catchy songs as they've been accustomed to.  By the end of the film, their eyes were downcast...and it wasn't from sleep-deprivation.The film isn't all that it was hyped to be.  Much of what you see in the commercials is the whole film...why go to the theaters?  The commercials tell you everything!  Moreover, the story isn't widely original, either. If you've ever watched \"We're Back\", \"Pete's Dragon\", \"All Dogs Go To Heaven\" or \"E.T.\" (all children/family movies) then you've already watched this film.  It's the typical plot about children who find an amazing discovery, keep it a secret, abuse its powers, and learn to extend beyond their own feelings.  For my children, probably the most damaging to the plot, however, was their dislike of the giant itself.  There wasn't enough to connect him with the audience which undermines the emotion the rest of the film builds on.  Without the connection between such a key character, the audience loses interest.Furthermore, the movie's animation barely matched with current releases. There weren't as many lush color tones or smooth-running lines to make the film visually appealing.  Don't get me wrong, Warner Brothers has had great animation in the past (although its last ventures \"Quest For Camelot\" and \"The King and I\" were complete flops).  If they'd only stick with Bugs Bunny, they'd have the works played out in their hands.  \"Space Jam\" was wildly successful, plus the shading and colors of \"old\" characters brought new life to their persona.  In several aspects, \"Space Jam\" was far superior from animation to plot, aesthetics to witty lines when compared to \"The Iron Giant\".  Where past Warner Brothers animation aimed toward the family, \"The Iron Giant\" aimed for the commercial.  Several times, the topic of Superman (a character which Warner Brothers owned) was brought up.  Soon, we'll see Superman figures lined up with the corny Iron Giant banks and toothbrushes.Lastly, there's the objectional material.  For the first time in my life, I saw the main character of a cartoon, feature-length movie use the restroom. The use of the bathroom is all too common in live action films, but they've begun to pass surreptitiously into cartoons.  Why does such a scene need to take place?  All in all, the film relays an anti-government atmosphere. The main characters are always on the run while officials heartlessly chase its \"victims\".  I admit, several children's books are perfect for Hollywood. This one may have been one if taken from a different approach.",

I was, after reading the Rotten Tomatoes page (62 positive reviews out of 64, and most ecstatic - in a dignified professional-critic way of course). Seeing it at an empty theater with no one to share responses didn't help either. I wrote off its fans as mainly Disney-haters.Well...that was dumb of me. IRON GIANT survived my hype-overload letdown, repairing my impression of it bit by bit till I realized all those gushing over it were on to something. There's no other animated film quite like it - it isn't as ambitious as, say, PRINCESS MONONOKE, but that's partly what makes it so interesting, how it turns a typical Hollywood boy-with-a-hidden-friend story into something magical. It isn't perfect, sure - I'm an animal-rights champion and even I didn't like the hunting scene - but it's still wonderful.Seeing this movie garner such admiration after its humiliating theatrical death is like seeing a high school wallflower blossom into a gorgeous adult who has to beat off suitors with a stick. It deserves it. No wonder Ted Hughes loved its screenplay, different though it was from his book; he died right before its release, and they co-dedicated it to him onscreen.

On the surface, it looked like a kid's movie, much like a lot that were coming out at that time, mainly from Disney. I was pleasantly surprised. I found the movie to be quite enjoyable. The animation was excellent, and very reminiscent of older Disney movies (I myself am not a fan of the new style Disney is using.) The characters were fairly well-developed and fit together well and the movie had a really good plot. The only thing that kind of made me mad was the stigma that \"guns are bad, they kill people!\" It's not the guns, it's the people who pull the trigger or who use them improperly.  Unfortunately, there was nowhere in the movie that I could see improper usage of them. At any rate, the movie was certainly a good animation, and I wouldn't mind watching it again. I give it a 9 out of 10, its only fault being the anti-gun bit.",

He is terrified as we all would be by this unknown being, but then it stops in its tracks. It sits down, begins to mimic Hogarth, he teaches it words and they form a bond of trust. Its probably about 45 seconds of screen time, but it transforms the story from one of fear to one of the complex beauty of the human imagination and human connection.The Iron Giant a precursor to Brad Bird's Pixar success with Ratatouille and The Incredibles is a haunting piece that captures history and emotion all in one. It's 1957 with Sputnik orbiting the Earth, everyone is terrified by the Red Scare, the unknown and that beings from other worlds are trying to destroy us. The Giant comes from this unknown world above us and is whispered about with concern, fear and suspicion.But young Hogarth Hughes sees the monster before anyone else does. It's like a child that is lost, he teaches it lessons, nurtures it and gives it a sense of purpose. Both are loners to an extent, and their bond of friendship along with the Giant's transformation is one of the more beautiful bonds you'll see in any film. There is another moment whereThis is not a Disney film with songs or dances. Bird is above that, and instead creates a setting in small-town America that mirrors the feelings of the world in that historical era. Hogarth himself fears how people will see his \"friend\", and the fearsome government agent Mansley captures this attitude of 1950's America in that the unknown is a threat to public safety and that it must be stopped, isolated and removed at all costs.I will try not give away the ending, but all I will say is be prepared to have your heartstrings pulled at. The Giant is remarkable symbol of not judging something before you know it, it has a personality and emotion that experiences pain, joy and sadness and a willingness to do the right thing at any cost. Much like ET, King Kong and even Inside Out there is a moment where something must be given up, in order for the greater good to occur and that we choose our paths no matter what others try to shape us as or determine for us. While the Disney Renaissance broke the mold for modern animation, the Iron Giant does something all of those films(many of which I do love could not.) It teaches us something about the unknown, and that what we fear can actually turn out to be something that isn't trying to kill us or hurt us. Instead, what we fear can be something that transforms our way of thought, and gives people a new sense of hope and resilience in the face of destruction and war.10/10",

While the deceptively simple ingredients that made \"the Iron Giant\" could easily have made a typical formula product, such as \"a really cool movie with lots of explosions about a kid who makes friends with a misfit giant robot,\" this film is something profoundly more unique.  The sentance that director Brad Bird used to describe the essence of this film was \"a gun that learns to love.\"When the Giant falls from the sky into the life of Hogarth Hughes, it brings with it chaos, war, fear, greed and exploitation.  It is the objectification of the base animal instincts of humanity, posessing unlimited power for technological destruction, but innocent of good or evil like a child.  Nobody knows where it comes from- was it made by the Russians, or god?  Hogarth wants to keep it for himself- Dean, his friend the existentialist beatnik artist, wants to hide it and pretend it doesn't exist- the government wants it destroyed- and Kent Mansley, the main antagonist, has such a competitive lust to conquer it, he'll wreck families, whole towns, and even himself to do it.The conflict climaxes at the point of an impending nuclear strike. But the Giant, programmed as a weapon to destroy what attacks it regardless of any other consequences, has discovered it has a heart, and it chooses to step aside from it's destiny, and sacrifice itself to save from death the people it loves.  It's a jesus-like sacrifice, but instead of serving god's will, this is a choice of free will, a humanist message that's open to interpretation but wonderfully sincere.Where other great films use many of these ingredients- deep psychological insight, mythic-poetic archetypes, socio-political allegory (the cold war), great humor and entertainment (squirrels in the pants)- they might end up being insubstantial if they lack the biggest ingredient in \"the Iron Giant\", heart.  It makes me cry every time I hear the Iron Giant's last words.  Besides those things, it has universal appeal.  As a \"family oriented cartoon\" film with lots of jokes and pop culture references, which was a commecial failure due to executive mismanagement, this film proves that the value of creative expression is independant from terms like \"low art\" and the value measurements of commerce.  It's a work of art first and a commercial product second.  Compared to the current wave of dissatisfyingly hollow, ideologically self-reflexive, corporate-mythmaking computer-generated blockbusters about living toys and dream factories run by friendly monsters, this film should be the standard to judge all future animated features by.",

Not only IMDb I checked for it on many other movie database websites it was almost at the top of almost all of it name it be Metacritics, Rotten Tomatoes, Movie Web and only after seeing it I can understand why!! Really good one the story was simple and awesome the characters were remarkably fits the story and pretty much I was with movie flow shouting 'Kent Mansley' sometimes hehehehe. The movie is worth a watch if you haven't seen it, well just only I feel the movie label is too limited I had to get it from eBay from US but it was really worth it!! The movie is well better for kids as it is having good moral, the script was good with the direction of the movie sequence as Ted Hughes authored \"Iron Giant\". Just keep up the good work!!",

It was bad enough that the kids talked but even more inconsiderate that their parents were holding conversations with them!So, aside from the danger of young kids in the audience, the Iron Giant is about as good a show as you're likely to see this year.

In the midst of this, I find the retro style of Iron Giant to be familiar and comfortable.

            "content": "I recently saw The Iron Giant on video, and as usual with most \"kid-targeted\" movies, I was half-expecting it to be an embarassment. Well, everyone should be pleased to know that this movie is not targeted at any specific age group! The best film-makers know that great animated movies should appeal to everyone; just adding on the word \"animated\" does not automatically equate to a movie for kids only. The strongest asset of The Iron Giant lies in the writing. EVERY character is nothing short of believable and realistic, and there are several fairly strong  including \"guns kill\" and \"souls can't die.\" This may sound trite when taken out of context and put on paper, but the delivery of these in the actual film is anything but. How often do we get animated features like this, that depart form the traditional formula and deliver truly positive messages, all without turning preachy?     In addition to the dramatic elements, there's a good share of successful comedy. The whole \"superman\" element is amusing, and several other parts (including the bit where the Giant decides to emulate Hogarth's cannonball dive into a lake) are worth laughing out loud for. Also, in what is a VERY wise decision, there are no musical numbers and no obligatory comic-relief characters. Inserting either would hurt The Iron Giant's overall flow greatly, as the script and voice acting are intelligent enough to deliver the entertainment on their own. Finally, just to compliment things, the visuals are really cool. I clearly noticed changes in style throughout; the backgrounds, foreground objects, and characters all have their own distinct look and feel, making the environment suitably lush.        The bottom line? Well, I would reccomend THE IRON GIANT to anyone, regardless of age. Hands down, this is the best animated film I've ever seen thus far. RATING: **** (out of ****) NOTE THAT I WILL USE A STAR BASED SCALE FROM NOW ON.",

This is an \"ET\"-style fantasy in which a young boy befriends a giant robot from outer space and teaches him about life among us humans. Young Hogarth Hughes works to keep his over-size buddy from being discovered by his loving Mom and the US government. The movie is set in 1957 Maine, and it nicely evokes the paranoid atmosphere of the cold war era. People assume the robot is a secret weapon of the commies, but in the end the giant saves us all from nuclear disaster. The animation is clean and lively. The giant moves with a mechanical fluidity thanks to computers, giving it a different look versus the hand-drawn human characters. The director of this film is a former producer/writer on \"The Simpsons\" and \"King of the Hill,\" but here he refrains from the biting cynicism of those shows without crossing over into the sentimentality of most Disney movies. There are no cute animal sidekicks, no musical numbers, no happily ever after. But \"The Iron Giant\" is a smart, sweet must-see for animation fans of all ages.",

So, let \"The Iron Giant\" have the 10/10.Why, we got used to being shown bunches of evil aliens, menacing robots and maniac Russians (what a pity)... and this animation is a nice change. Not so evil aliens, a goodwill robot and such a lovely sputnic right in the beginning... yeah, we did it first ;-DRating it 10/10 doesn't mean this multfilm is ideal but only proves I liked it to the extent of caring about its plot twists, animation quality, minor bugs etc. Surely you would be right saying 'tis highly subjective. No surprise: I have a fancy for robots, aliens and Russians... for some of them for sure.Watching this animation you (and, of course, your kids, if there are any) hardly would want to search for mismatches or glitches or whatever as it has the features of a tale when you are not forced to believe, to stick to realism, but you take the story close, and it has some deep honest overtones. The movie is rather laconic and inspiring as you are let to guess the characters' background, is really humorous, no cheap jokes, no sugar, definite style, the 1950's atmosphere; I assure you, you need not to be even American or a comics fan to appreciate it.And though I disapprove, err, the total gun abstinence, even in the dire need of defense (that is a bit too of satiagraha, or orthodox Christianity, eh?), I pity most that watched this seven year old movie only yesterday.",

The fact that it is animated only adds to its magic.  The animation is absolutely superb, strongly rivaling Disney's best.  The screenplay is wonderful, all of the characters are incredibly three-dimensional (something which, alas, I have a difficult time saying about the most recent Disney films), and the voice-over acting is simply the best ever.  The young boy who voiced the character of Hogarth Hughes is a true talent - his voice coupled with Hogarth's animator's drawing prowess gives the audience the best depiction of a young person ever.  Hogarth is very honest and real-to-life, from his innocent romping and make-believe sessions to his deepest and most heartfelt emotions; at no point in the film does director Brad Bird patronize youth. Hogarth is unabashedly human and not a \"boy as he should be\" caricature. Not since Elliot in \"E.T.\" has a young character been so real.The character of the Iron Giant is so well drawn - both visually and emotionally - that I often had to remind myself that he was not a living, breathing human being.  In fact, the magic and mystery of this film is the fact that it took a character of cold metal and made it more human than the average person one sees walking down the street.  The Giant is a wonderful symbol of modern man and the beautiful heart that is still within him, albeit buried deeply beneath layers of materialism and aggression.  This movie is a great reminder of man's true nature - \"souls don't die\" - and the possibility that, with the help of the Hogarth Hughes within him, he will discover the Superman he truly is.",

I dislike the idea that unless we're inundated with Happy Meal tie-ins and action figures, the film is under-advertised. There certainly was adequate advertising for this film; it simply wasn't in titanic Disney proportions.The Iron Giant is, no exaggeration, one of the best animated films of the last ten years. As a childhood fable, as a view of fifties foreign paranoia, as a statement on violence, it works perfectly.  There isn't a single flawed scene from beginning to end. And it proves conclusively that animation can work without cute animal sidekicks or overwrought musical numbers; just a great story, brilliantly timed comedy, and some truly touching moments.The combination of cel animation and computer imagery is seamless, with each technique used to its best effect. The voice-acting is top-notch, with Christopher MacDonald particularly good as the paranoid government agent. Having not read the book myself, I can't vouch for the film's adherence to the original story, but I highly recommend it to any lover of animation.Incidentally, lest you think it's purely for children, I watched it with a group of men over thirty, and we all loved it. Let's hope this film gets the discovery on video it was denied in the theater. A solid 10.",

The characters were very real, despite them being animated (and who says animation isn't as valid as live-action...I argue that it can surpass live-action) and all, including the Giant, were lovable.  It doesn't preach anything to the viewer, either.  I also like how the movie combined classic design/animation with high-tech visual effects of the movie.  Superb.

I've read WB is taking a bath on this feature and it just doesn't seem right... this is so much better than Tarzan. I'll have to see it a few more times to help WB out, and I don't even have kids!

Because first we have great animations, which of cause is a plus, but then we have the theme about the friendship between the boy and the giant, which makes it wonderful. And the fact that its not just a cute traditional cartoon makes it in to my top-twenty movies. (And I've seen a lot of movies...) But the reason that is so great is that it is simply hilarious.

            "content": "Like all great stories The Iron Giant works on a number of different levels. In the simplest sense, it's a first-rate adventure story for kids with a nice balance of action and humor. There's a \"moral\" to the story but very little actual moralizing and none of the groan-inducing variety. The artwork and the music use familiar elements without falling into clich\u00e9. But there's more. The Iron Giant also works as a re-telling of myth, combining elements as old as storytelling itself. In Joseph Campbell's landmark book, The Hero With A Thousand Faces, he shows how certain themes are constantly recurring in mythology, religion, psychology and literature. Campbell's work leans heavily on the writings of Carl Jung, who believed that these ideas are part of our human heritage and understood on a deeper level (often without our awareness). While this may seem like a lot of baggage to be strapping onto 90 minutes of family entertainment, it works. Furthermore, poet Ted Hughes, the writer of the story on which the film is (loosely) based, knew his mythology as well.While a small book could be written on the themes running through The Iron Giant it's important to avoid the \"this = that\" sort of allegory found in Cliff Notes and high school English courses. The giant does not \"stand for\" this or that figure in religion or myth. There are elements of Osiris, the Egyptian figure whose body is scattered and re-assembled and Iron John, from the European folk tale collected by the Brothers Grimm and the subject of Robert Bly's generally misunderstood book. There are lots of interesting twists on the classic themes. The character of \"Dean\" functions partly in the Iron John role and partly as the Old Wise Man. This figure is often a wizard in folklore (think of Merlin or Gandalf) but the writers turned him into a twenty-something Beatnik sculptor. The list goes on and we haven't even mentioned Hogarth. If this all seems a bit too much like a Required Reading list or a homework assignment ignore this and see the movie. If, however, this all sounds interesting, read Joseph Campbell and see the movie.

If Warner Bros. does Superman, they need to watch this movie REPEATEDLY before they get a script.  If anything, this film evokes the true feelings of those comics. You MUST see Iron Giant.

I saw it last night and my head has been so busy with thinking about it that I just had to sit down and send a quick note to my friends to let you know how wonderful a movie it is. It has so much love and care put into every frame and it shows. The characters are nicely fleshed out, the voice performances are wonderful, the themes of the film are so seamlessly sewn into story that it never feels preachy and most importantly, it is 100% entertaining. I went into the movie with extremely high expectations having heard others rave about it. I felt sure that I would be let down some because of the hype. Not for a moment. I was pulled in from frame one and was taken into this little boy's world until the very end. It does not pander to kids and it does not try to be cleaver with a wink-of-the-eye towards adults. The message that this story, set in Maine in 1957, brings to America in 1999 cannot be ignored.You do not need a child to accompany you to see this film but when I walked out of the theatre I was trying to think of nieces, nephews, neighbor kids, or anyone who could provide me an excuse to see it again. If you were already going to see \"The Iron Giant\" (or have already seen it) that is great. However, if reading this has put you one step closer to seeing a film that you were going to pass on then I am glad.",

It's like a normal live-action type movie, but everything is drawn instead. I love the medium of animation, because you can do so much with it. The special effects blended much better with the hand-drawn animation in this movie, then I've seen anywhere else. In many recent animated movies, it seems like the characters are drawn into a background where they don't belong, or even fit in. This movie has restored my faith in Warner Brothers Animation. The story was wonderful, the voice artistry wasn't over-done, and the animation was nearly flawless. This movie is definitely one that everyone can enjoy without feeling as if they're watching a \"kiddie\" movie. What are you waiting for? Go see it before it's gone!",

The highs for the Iron Giant comes to its script and voice acting, but this may also be its weaknesses. It is not too great, it is not too good. But the Iron Giant is a very good sci-fi film, its about a robot helping this boy, it is really a good plot.

As much as I love Disney, I hope they take notes and get rid of the stupid animal sidekicks. \"Tarzan\" could have been one of their best since \"Beauty & the Beast\", but for two things stupid animal sidekicks and \"Trashing the Camp\" a worthless number that slowed the pace down. But this is not a review of \"Tarzan\". \"Iron Giant\" had wonderful characters that lended humor when called for without idoitic gags, tears (Yes, I was nearly crying at the end), and boundless joy that made the audience feel uplifted and like they were a kid again. And it was rated \"PG\".A side note to parents, at the screening my husband & I went to, there were a lot of kids (we do not have children at this time). The parent who sat beside us had a boy about 7 or 8. the child was asking a lot of deep, good questions that the parent did not have time to really answer and discuss with the child. So, a word of warning... if you have young children you may want to screen this movie by yourself and then take your child. This does not mean that this is NOT a good movie for kids, I just think you need to enjoy it too and give yourself time before or after the movie to discuss issues with your child.The animation was super and way beyond Warner's last attempt with \"Quest for Camelot\". I look forward to their next movie and hope it will be as entertaining as this. I give this movie four thumbs up (my husband's two and my two!). I really hope it does well in the box office.",

At the suggestion that the family find a fallout shelter once the nuclear missile is aimed at the Giant, Dean sadly replies that \"It doesn't matter...no shelter can protect us.\"  And Hogarth tells his friend \"We're all going to die.\"  Using the old \"duck and cover\" cartoon is brilliant: what a contrast between that moment of boundless optimism, and the end, when reality hits!

Each movie features young protagonists who are dreamers and outsiders of their societies and present refreshingly peaceful resolutions to their respective conflicts.\"The Iron Giant\" has a wonderful nostalgic, small-town atmosphere that is brought to life by the stunning animation that is on par with anything that Disney has produced recently. The attention to period detail, from the cheesy educational videos that Hogarth's class is forced to watch, to the way townspeople talk, is faithfully recreated and really goes a long way to drawing you into this engaging world. In some respects, the animation style of this film recalls the early, groundbreaking Fleischer brothers Superman cartoons of the 1940s with its depth of field, but without the German Expressionist influence.The real strength of this film is the relationships between the characters -- something that is often overlooked in animated films for flashy visuals and epic musical numbers. \"The Iron Giant\" has the feel of a very intimate, character-driven film with the relationship between Hogarth and his robot friend as the emotional centre but with several other relationships (like the ones between Hogarth and his mother and between him and Dean) also featured prominently as well. This is no simple Saturday morning cartoon but a strong feature film that actually has something to say.\"The Iron Giant\" is one of those rare animated films that appeals to both children and adults, that doesn't contain one annoying musical number a la Disney, and that isn't one long advertisement for a toy. In fact, this film is an entertaining, even touching, story about tolerance and compassion. \"The Iron Giant\" refuses to talk down to its audience (the usual tactic of most animated films) or spoonfeed them any answers. It also deals with real issues like death and bigotry -- pretty heavy topics for a children's animated film.easily one of THE best animated films i've ever seen...",

The story is kept moving along without the now obligatory song and dance routines and goofy sidekicks perfected by the Mouse.  Instead the animators rely on a carefully crafted script and characterization.  The main morals of the movie are \"You are what you choose to be\" and an anti-violence message that seem particularly pertinant in this year of classroom horrors.

I also thought the remarkable convienence of the off/on lever on the power generators was soo funny. And boy did I cringe alot when the giant acted like an idiot. I also thought it was funny that the flashlight on Hogarth's gun was strapped so close to the gun's nozzle that if he fired it he'd blow out his flashlight. Also, when kent finds the gun, its broken off to say \"hog hug\" but later we can see it reads \"hoga hugh\". I also don't understand the bump on the giant's head, I mean when he goes nuts, pops out but then he's still able to calm down without the bump so its like what's the point of the bump when it doesn't affect his behavior?On the plus side, IG is well animated, I liked watching the characters: Annie, Kent, the General. I thought Hogarth, Dean, and the Giant's characters had some likeable moments and dislikeable moments. The premise is interesting and executed well. Its a change from what Disney has done. The ending was pretty cool to watch but I hadn't a clue why Annie and Dean got with each other so quickly since they never really developed romantically in the movie. It seems like they were slapped together just to make the audience happy (I felt the same way about Toy Story 2 but I don't even want to get into the details of how that has an unresolved ending). Overall, I give the movie a C+. If you want to see a real animated movie with an anti-violence theme, go watch Hayao Miyazaki's Nausicaa.",

It has elements of what made E.T. so lovable, but also some really original concepts about friendship. There's also the whole 50ft tall Vin Diesel robot thing going on. Even though he has about five lines of true Dialogue, you can tell it's the shaved gorilla strength under the chrome dome 100% of the time. I love the atmosphere of this movie, it really nails the 50s sci-fi feeling perfectly. The animation looks great and I kind've wish more movies looked like this, especially since cgi cartoons dominate all now. It's just a really great movie that will stand the test of time, unlike a lot of its contemporaries.10/10",

It is a story that every writer wishes to tell, but at a simple form so that it can be told to children as well. It is a story on how a child can get past every difference in another person/object, where adults cannot.I will watch this movie for years, and will pass it onto my children when the time comes. It is a movie that hopefully will stand throughout time, and still bring tears and joy onto the next generation.If only they would still make movies like this..",

The robot and the boy soon formed an unlikely friendship which was very sweet . Hogarth taught the robot words and different meanings of things and the robot started to show that it has feelings .

            "content": "One of the many rave reviews posted on this website contains the comment: \"I could watch the film time and again just for the animation.\"  In my opinion, it is the beautiful visual style ALONE that makes this film work and makes it enjoyable.  Had the animation and design been as bland and pedestrian as the recently released \"The King and I\", few movie-goers would be as fond of the film.  In fact, I think it would be a bomb.The characters are certainly likeable, but too one-dimensional to rise above being mere character \"types\".  We learn virtually nothing about them, other than what they are up to in the present moment.  It's as if they have no existence, no thoughts, no life at all other than what we happen to be seeing up there on the screen.  There is no depth to them that would suggest that their lives and their world extends beyond the edge of the frame.There's the precocious boy (Hogarth) that knows more than the grown-ups, the flustered but loving Mom who tries to understand her mischievous son, the friendly adult (Dean) who's really young at heart and serves as an ally to the boy, and on and on.  And how convenient that Hogarth lives on a farm where there's a big barn, suitable for storing a large robot.  How convenient that Dean works in an iron-filled junk yard and makes art out of iron--choices that come in very handy when one has a large iron robot to contend with.What I'm objecting to in this film is what I see as a lack of fresh ideas in the story and the script.  Clever, original thought has been sacrificed (as it usually is) for the same old cliches.  As a result, there were almost no surprises in this film.  Young people who aren't as familiar with the cliches will have a ball, I'm sure.  And adults who enjoy re-visiting the cliches that are comfortably familiar will love it, too.  But for those who want to be impressed with new perspectives, or delighted with clever surprises and unexpected turns in the story, this film will not satisfy.",

It also had a couple of priceless visual references to other films; my favourite being the jittering teacup from Poltergeist.What came as quite a surprise was that this very capable exploratory, and very lethal war/invasion machine was self-aware. He saw the value of life and made a conscious choice that he did not want to be a destroyer of life. And it was delightful to see that although he had a destructive instinct, he chose to resist it and be what he wanted to be. It thrilled me to no end that he was determined to prove that \"I am not a gun.\"This movie is a must-see and I thank my five year old son for coaxing me to buy tickets for it.",

I was 6, and one day my father came to me after work and said,\"Do you want to go see the Iron Giant with your brother and me?\" Naturally seeking any opportunity to spend time with him (my folks divorced when I was about 2), I accepted and saw the movie later that night. If only you could go back to a specific time, and experience it all over again.I was in awe at the film, from the time the squirrel ran up Dean's pants to the tear-jerking end where The Giant despaired over nearly losing Hogarth, went on a rampage, and in the end, made the decision that he was not a gun. That he could choose who he wanted to be, despite being sent to Earth with the previous intention of destruction, and sacrificed himself for the town. When I saw The Giant fly to the bomb, utter the word,\"superman\", and close his eyes, I broke into tears.I couldn't stop talking about it afterwards. My brother and I obsessed over it on the ride home, and I mentally mulled it over in my mind that night. Now, about 9 years later, I saw it on the movie listings on the TV, turned it on for my 7 month old brother while I cleaned the front room, and my awe was rekindled all over again. Such life lessons about violence, decisions, and finding out who you are, is very rare for a child's movie.My heart twisted at seeing The Giant's familiar act at the end. Right after I went on the net, and found out that it was a financial failure way back when.What a horrible shame.I gave this a 9/10 because the guns kill people message got abit corny once or twice in the film, but that was the only real problem with this great movie. At least in my humble opinion.I recommend this movie for all ages, and if you haven't seen it, please do for your sake.May more movies like this come into existence.",

Because it isn't too explicit, but If you know nothing about Soviet Union (for instance, if you are a kid!), you would think that it's a paradise on Earth. A paradise where people wish to live a different life, but being threatened with nukes by USA.Can someone be so talented in something that it comes on the account on other abilities? Like an ability to read? People didn't live in USSR a different life because they wanted to, definitely not all of them. How one can know that? It's simple: people were executed for just an attempt to leave it (like in any other commie regime in history - what a surprise). Isn't it enough to derive everything else from it?I really love all 3 movies. But after watching The Iron Giant I will not recommend them to anyone, not even Incredibles 2.

Except for an advertising campaign that seems to have peaked two weeks ago, publicity has been almost zilch.All of this is a shame, because this is the best animated film I have seen in years. Brad Bird has crafted a fully realized world from the fifties, and set it in the animation style familiar to those times. There are shades of Lady and the Tramp in the large lines and fluid movement that the human characters exhibit. More telling than any technical aspect, though(including the amazing computer-generated giant), is the script. This is a beautiful one. Simple enough for children, but aimed at adults, the movie had everyone in the sparsely populated movie theatre laughing and cheering.This movie should be seen by everyone it can.

The way how Hogarth said things like \"I go, you stay, stop following me\" or \"You can be what you want to be\" we're repeated which really made me cry. The Iron Giant said that in a sad way. The animation was beautiful. The Iron Giant just wanted peace. Hogarth really was like me, just younger. Dean was helpful and nice, though he wasn't showed in the movie enough! Hogarth's mum, Annie, was a lady who cared for her child. I loved this movie.",

The only reason i gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10 is because i honestly think that this film would have had a deeper meaning and more impact if the iron giant stayed dead in the end.  not that i hated his character, rather i think the giant was a great character.  the giant is actually one of the purest and most genuine of characters.  i wouldnt want him dead in real life, but hey this is a movie with deep overtones of social duty and tolerance (also a very fun and entertaining movie too!).  the giant's sacrifice has the potential to bring out the best in all of us, but his rebirth invalidates all that.  his rebirth just lowers the film back to the status of a simple kiddie flick where everything just ends up being good.",

It shows an army of Iron Giants (in weapons mode) marching on a planet. They start destroying everything in sight.

The animation is as good as anything the Disney Studios have turned out, the character design is more interesting and the story is better than anything Disney has managed to come up with in years. And, it is an animated film, supposedly meant for children (though I am sure most adults will enjoy it thoroughly), that is not a musical! Hurrah!Since the world has not come to an end, we can only hope more studios follow suit in upcoming animation projects.

Thank God for my kids, because without their insisting I would have missed the best animated movie I've seen since Toy Story.  A quarter into the movie I'd already decided to buy the movie the minute it's released on DVD. There's a lot of humor that might be lost on kids, most of it related to period satire.  However, my 4 year old son laughed throughout the movie, and afterward told me \"I'm the good giant robot, Momma\" (Do I see us buying Iron Giant Merchandise? You betcha!)  I felt that the movie was like a nostalgic trip to my own childhood.  I remember when Superman was THE hero to be, and the difference between right and wrong was clearly defined.

The script is well written and its so nice to see an animated character reveal themselves through dialog and action rather than a musical number. Billed as \"kid's movie\", the story is never dumbed down and was very enjoyable for us adults. The animation and color are first rate, but the movie shines as it take full advantage of the freedom of camera movement and editing the medium offers.\nWe walked out of the theater, and my friend's first comment I think is the best review I've heard yet, \"I wish we could make films like that at Disney!\"Yes the \"boy befriends kind hearted monster\" story has been done many times, but not this well since Spielberg brought E.T. to the screen in 1982.I would recommend to anyone this under-advertised movie, which so far this year, has the strongest exit polls of any other film.",

            "content": "I went to see the anime \"The Iron Giant\" last Sunday. This was 6,50$can extremely well spent and it was a very good surprise for me because, let's face it, the TV ads doesn't make it justice.The characters are extremely well developed, although the villain tend to be the caricatural type, but, I insist, only him. All the others characters are sounds and credible. The story is simple enough to be understood by young children, and yet, at the same time, is complex enough to draw the parents into it. It is a good thing that \"The Iron Giant\" didn't go through the Disney studios because they would have destroy those two basic elements [characters + story] to \"accommodate\" their own simpleton standards.Technically, even if the movie looks like having been made in the 1960s, it is not. The use of lights and shadows give it a real 3 dimensional look that wasn't seen before the computer effects. And contrary to the American version of \"Godzilla\", the giant doesn't change size from one scene to the other. Also, the use of the Japanese style [big eyes] help a lot to make the emotions go through each characters. Even the robot, which tells a lot by itself. By moments, you completely forget that the characters are \"drawn\"; they just become \"real\".As for the humor, it was not tone down to little children. They were not the adult kind \u00e0-la-South-Park either. It was often satirical and you have to be at least 20-years-old to really understand some because of the history behind them. I had some tears twice because I laugh too hard in my seat. The look of the soldier at the end is an anthology piece alone.I believe the creator of \"The Iron Giant\" died during the making of the movie, so he didn't saw the final product. He would have been proud. My greatest hope is that the sequel (if there is one as I hope) will keep this high level of quality in storytelling, characters, humor and audience-intelligentsia.I cannot encourage you enough to go see it on a giant screen.",

But it is no mere meteorite; it is a 100 ft. tall metal-eating giant robot, sentient and sensitive. It is discovered by Hogarth Hughes, a young boy who lives with his mother. His father, possibly a jet pilot (photo in frame), is either dead or has divorced his mother. After the initial shock and fear, Hogarth befriends the iron giant, and slowly, almost without realizing it, teaches the giant about ethics and morality (that we all have souls, that souls live on forever, that it is wrong to kill). Trouble comes in the form of a government man who, displaying the paranoia of 1950's America, sees the giant as a potential threat.The animation is reminiscent of Don Bluth's work, without the insipid, treacly and gratuitous musical numbers. It portrays children, in particula r Hogarth, realistically, and reminded me of the innocent sweetness of the children in Miyazaki's films, \"My Neighbor, Totoro\" and \"Kiki's Delivery Service.\"The blending of computer-generated and traditional animation is virtually seamless and artfully-done.The scripting is at once funny, intelligent and bittersweet without being maudlin. I loved the wonderful attention paid to details: The \"Duck and Cover cartoons\" were accurate and hilarious; Detailing, even down to the F-86's, period jet fighters, was amazing; The subtle homages paid to other sci-fi genre TV and films such as \"Johnny Sako and His Giant Robot,\" or the cobra-like martian death rays from \"War of the Worlds.\"Inevitably, some will compare this film to the book by Ted Hughes. While director/screenwriter Brad Bird may have taken liberties with the original storyline, I think the movie carries the gentleness and intelligent spirit of Hughes's book. The film didn't talk down to children, nor was it heavy-handed in its message, like \"E.T.\"High praise for this film and for Warner Bros.!! Let's hope it raises the bar for mainstream American animation.",

Oh I'm sure that it will get nominated in the Animated Feature category, but I doubt we're going to see this film's name in either of the categories where it belongs - Best Screenplay and Best Picture.  The sad thing is that this is probably more likely going to be due to a lack of an attempt on the part of Warner Brothers to push the film as a Best Picture/Screenplay nominee than on the unwillingness of the Academy to nominate it in those categories.  Warner Brothers will I'm sure make at least a token effort to outperform Disney's \"Tarzan\" marketing juggernaut, but I won't be suprised if it doesn't even occur to the powers that be to float this as a Best Picture/Screenplay contender.That said, the Iron Giant is, without a doubt, the best film of 1999, and probably one of the 10 best stories ever told on film.  The animation is typical Disney-esque fare, and if there are technical categories for animated features there's no reason to think that IG should win an award in one.  What carries this film is the writing, both story and screenplay, and wonderfully performed voice acting.  Take special note of Vin Diesel (yeah...Vin Diesel) as the Iron Giant.  I don't know how much easier voice acting might be than regular acting, but in this case, Diesel nails it.There's the usual spate of grown-up jokes thrown in to keep adults entertained, and the robot's Cool Quotient is right up there with iMacs.But when you get down to it it's the simple yet perfectly told story that make this film great to watch.",

I try to be objective about it, but at least part of me likes this movie because it's an animated feature that isn't Disney and doesn't conform to the horrible and (at least i think) destructive formula that Disney has decided that our children are best served.This movie had brilliant visual effects.  Beautiful, awe-inspiring, altogether wonderful visuals.  Some nice touches of realism too (Hogarth being knocked down into the giant's palm as the giant stood up was a nice touch).  The voice talent was excellent on all fronts, and the direction, just wow.That being said, I have to take exception with the ending.  The ending took an incredibly powerful scene of personal sacrifice and goodness and just plain cheapened it.  The natural theme of the story is heroism.  The giant's heroic act, which would have perfectly completed the movie, was near ruined by the final scene.It almost seems like the ending was tacked on after the story was complete, because otherwise, I really don't see any point for the dialogue about souls not dying.  It seems like this was meant to soften the blow of the giant's sacrifice, but because of that (insert expletive) last scene there's no sacrifice to lessen!So, when I watch this movie, I find it best to stop the tape right after the statue scene and pretend the rest never happened.The only other issue I have with the movie (and it's a small one) is the hunter scene.  Those hunters are put in a bad light for killing the innocent little deer, and if they were sport hunting, they should be put in a bad light, but if they were food hunting, I think the movie was overly harsh on them.  Though we like to pretend we aren't, we are still a species that kills animals to eat and survive.Overall, though, a real good movie.  Highly recommended, etc, etc.  Just think about the ending a bit before you swallow the happy pill.thanks for listening, joe",

It really made me think about the cold war and weapons etc. I just loved the character of the giant, his eyes were so expressive. I have bought the video, and will force my family to see it as it is something not to be missed.I think it is more of an adults/ older children's film, because of deeper layers.

The kind of yarn I loved to see as a boy (The Invisible Boy, The Day the Earth Stood Still, etc.) Fun to see it was set in 1957, the year before i was born.When I get a DVD, this will be one of the titles I shall buy.A labour of love. Drips with quality. Good character animation, and some very clever use of cinematics. I wanted to see this one at the movies when it came out, but didn't. I could have sat through it, I thought, but dragging the kids along seemed a bit far fetched, so I give it a miss.I am very glad I eventually saw it on video. Do you want to know who chose the film?My 4\u00bd year old son. We watched it together and both thoroughly enjoyed the experience.I just loved it when the Giant lets loose against the threatening forces. That scene was a little strong for my nipper, but he could sit through it as I was beside him.I am looking forward to seeing it again one day./Soup",

This different styled film sits right up there with the best of Disney and will be a welcome addition to any library of classic animated and/or childrens films.I would say that the last fifteen minutes or so would, to me, disqualify it from being a very young children's film. I originally bought it for my four year old girl but, after viewing it first, decided to put it away for a couple of years. Then I'm sure it will become a regularly viewed item in our household.",

There wasn't a single thing I hated about the movie, for me it was outstanding on every level. The animation was absolutely gorgeous, with stunning colourful backgrounds and brilliant character animation especially on the Iron Giant himself. The music by Michael Kamen was consistently excellent, and never overpowered the story. In fact at times it even enhanced the drama. And the film has a beautiful message not to mention a sweet story. The characters were delightful, Hogarth isn't annoying at all and the Iron Giant isn't scary in the slightest. Strictly speaking he has to be one of the most gentle and poignant characters in an animated film. There are plenty of effective scenes like the explosive climax and the scene with the dead deer is a real tear jerker. I will admit I was worried initially when I saw the voice cast, but everybody involved did a superb job. Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jnr were perfect, in their most understated performances. Both get stick about being untalented, but for me their vocal contributions in this film suggests otherwise, while Christopher MacDonald almost steals the film as the FBI agent. Eli Marienthal is very sweet and likable as Hogarth too, and watch out for John Mahoney and Cloris Leachman. All in all, an outstanding film, that if you mind me saying so is the best animated film of 1999 and one of the best films of that year too. I may be wrong but I do think it is highly underrated on IMDb. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The dialogue is excellent \u2014 I especially enjoyed Mansley (Christopher McDonald) and his line concerning Hogarth's (Eli Marienthal) name. The \"duck and cover\" film in school is a nod to the absurdity of the time. The \"Space Age\" is one of my favorite motifs of American history, which the film showcases with the Giant's (Vin Diesel) pose in front of the burger-joint billboard, Hogarth's toy gun, with the character of Earl Stutz (M. Emmet Walsh), the fisherman who sees the Giant's descent from the sky, and, of course, Superman. The movie is paced phenomenally well, packing an exceptional story into 87 minutes. Nothing's wasted. Giant's \"attack mode\" is also completely badass. The ending is one of the greatest of all time, for any more genre, ever. I don't know if 1999 really was \"the best year for movies,\" but The Iron Giant is one of the statement's pillars, for sure.

            "content": "The Iron Giant is one of the best animated films ever and holds up to this day. The storytelling in this movie is phenomenal with it tugging on your heart and knowing how to make small details feel powerful. Brad Bird and Tim McCanlies made an almost perfect script. Yes, there are few lines that don't hit and seem out of place, but the amount is very small compared to a lot of other films. It is such a simple story that anyone can connect with, yet the filmmakers take the film to such heights that there are a lot of deep emotions planted into it. The voice cast also does a very good job in the film with each person in the cast making the character their own. Eli Marienthal never gets annoying or feels like he needs to get everything his way like some other kids in animated films. Yes, Hogarth has wants, but he never comes off as whiny or annoying. Harry Connick Jr. also does a great job. At some points you can tell that it is Harry Connick Jr. voicing Dean, but his voice fits the character and the design of Dean so well that it doesn't really affect the viewing experience. James Gammon also really makes his character come alive which is accompanied by a great character design and fun animation. Speaking of the animation, it was quite good. I found all the character designs to be very nice with a lot of fun gags that were enjoyable to watch. There are some iffy shots mainly with The Iron Giant as sometimes he looks flat and not three dimensional. Plus, there are some blurry shots and some color issues. The only reason I point this out is that this film had a bigger budget than a lot of the other animated films that were released during its time which shows that it wasn't the best quality. While I am nitpicking, I do want to say that some scenes felt a tiny bit empty. I think the sound design and score were slightly off. The score from Michael Kamen falls a bit flat sometimes and doesn't quite capture the excitement and thrill of what is on screen. The sound design is also off in some scenes with certain sounds not sounding like what it should be which sometimes led to it drowning out the dialogue. Even with those nitpicks, the film can still stand greatly above a lot of other animated films. The script is so well-done and really makes a simple story have deep meanings that will surely leave an impact after the viewing is over. With some great character designs and a stellar voice cast to bring the script alive, The Iron Giant really is a piece of art that needs to be witnessed by everyone.

            "content": "The movie I'm reviewing is called \"The Iron Giant\". The movie came out in 1999 and written by Brad Bird.  The main actors in this movie are Vin Diesel, Eli Marienthal, Harry Connick Jr, Jennifer Aniston, and Christopher McDonald. This movie is probably one of my favorite movies of all time.  \n\nThe movie takes place in a town called Rockwell. The key characters in the movie are Hogarth, The Giant, Kent, Dean, Annie. In the beginning of the movie, it shows a sailor in a storm and sees a lighthouse, the lighthouse turns and reveals a figure with to glowing eyes like lights. The next scene is our main character Hogarth going to the diner his mom Annie works at, Hogarth also meets Dean at the diner. Hogarth is at home watching a movie when his power goes out and decides to check it out, and he finds an electrical substation. The Giant almost steps on Hogarth and begins eating the metal and electrocutes itself but Hogarth shuts it down and saves him. Kent Mansley is an investigator that finds Hogarth's BB gun and tries to find enough evidence on The Giant to send the army after him. Hogarth hides The Giant at Dean's Junkyard. The Giant goes beast mode because he thought Hogarth died and begins fighting the army back. Kent launched nuke at giant directed at the town, and The Giant sacrifices himself to save everyone.  \n\nThis movie has a lot of good messages in it. You are who you choose to be. The whole movie shows us that The Giant was designed to be a planet destroying machine, but he slowly becomes more human like and understands emotions and, in the end, does the ultimate sacrifice for the ones he cares about. This is one of the reasons why I love this movie. \n\nThe only thing I disliked about the movie is Kent Mansley, Hes not a bad character but he's kind of like the antagonist of the movie and it does a good job to get the viewer to dislike him. \n\nThe movie is really good and I don't want to say much about it because I think you should watch it for yourself.",

I had no idea that a classic animated movie outside of Disney from the 90's would be so great, but this truly is Brad Bird's first and best movie he's ever directed! As a kid, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs was my favorite movie of all time, but as an adult, The Iron Giant trumps any other movie in existence. This movie may not have a specific target audience, this movie may be way less popular than Wall-E, and this movie might have not been a box office hit, but easily anyone can enjoy this movie and just have the best time ever. My overall opinion: 10/10!",

I don't always agree with the viewpoints in Bird's movies but I wholeheartedly agree with his anti-gun violence rhetoric & the existentialism has a permanent place in my heart. Growing up I thought the sad part of the movie was that the boy was prevented from keeping his pet robot; as an adult I find it sad that the robot's willpower was not enough to avoid his true nature.

No movie has made as much of an impact on me as this one, and it truly is the only movie i know that absolutely deserves to be called a flawless masterpiece.

A 100-foot-tall robot crash lands on Earth and is discovered by a young boy (voiced by Eli Marienthal) who befriends him and teaches him to be good, not evil (\u00e2guns kills\u00e2?).  It is cute and often beautifully animated (taking place in Maine with lovely fall foliage).  When the robot gets hurt, his various parts are able to crawl back together to rebuild him. With the help of a beatnik artist (voiced by Harry Connick, Jr.), Hogarth (the boy) successfully hides the Iron Giant from the American authorities, specifically the CIA agent Kent Mansley (voiced by Christopher McDonald) ... for a time.  Soon they discover that the robot has been designed to defensively destroy anything that attacks it (with laser weapons of the future) and soon the US Army shows up to do just that (believing it may be a Russian attack).  In the end, for all its violence (including an atomic bomb which scared my 6-year-old), I felt a rather hard-to-miss Christian theme \u00e2\" after all, the robot dies for our sins (and may be resurrected, which reassured everyone).  Setting this aside, the film\u00e2(TM)s message that it is better to be good than evil and that guns/violence are horrible is worthwhile indeed.  Still, my 9-year-old gave it only 2 \u00c2 1/2 stars (\u00e2too boring\u00e2?) but the younger boy was much more impressed (4 stars).  I enjoyed it a lot, particularly for the early scenes where the robot is learning about its environment and some silly humour.  Yes, it brought a tear to my eye but I\u00e2(TM)m a pushover.",

It does have some appealing, an emotional plot and a good ending, but, for me, it stays at 8/10 because I feel I have seen this type of movie before. A kid that founds \"someone\" that is very unusual or big, no ones believes him. Then people discover that he does exist and are afraid can be harmful, so they decide to eliminate him. Then at the end, that creature confirms he is good and it's a happy ending. So it was very predictable for me, but it doesn't mean it was bad. Another thing is that it let me with some questions like, where does the robot come from? How does he understand so well English?

But the \"something extra\" that it has is that it is about more than the story.  Like all good sci-fi, it is not really about alien robots - it aims to tell us something about the human condition.  \n\nThis is a movie that exists for the denouement.  The whole movie sets you up so that you care about the characters and then at just the right moment, one word can have a powerful impact.  Like when the Farmer says \"that'll do, pig.\" in \"Babe\".   The whole movie existed to set up that wonderful moment.  \n\nIn \"The Iron Giant\", the word is \"Superman\".   It brings together a theme that runs through the movie - we all get to decide who we are going to be.  Our actions define us, not where we come from or anything else.  We get to choose.   So \"Superman\" hits like a ton of bricks when delivered at the perfect moment.\n\nThis movie is fantastic for the story telling, the characters and the wonderful message delivered so powerfully at the climax of the film.  The five critics who said that it isn't a good movie have got to be nuts.  If you don't like animation, or sci-fi, I can see how you might not enjoy this film. But if you are a reviewer of films, there is no rational excuse for failing to see the excellence on display.",

Such animation features are always a passion projects which is clearly visible in here and is also the primary reason why it creates the impact like on other usually does. \n\nIt is rich on technical aspects like cinematography, background score and editing. The animation speaks volume more than the words in here and as far as the script is concerned, it may follow a familiar format extracted from the textbook formula, but is undeniably an effective, impressive, charming and emotionally beautiful feature. \n\nTim McCanlies and Brad Bird; the screenwriters, have created a cozy and warm environment that is perfectly balanced on delivering the entertainment to both, its younger and older audience. Brad Bird; the director, is on his A game for the emotions projected in here creates a deeper impact on the viewers and connects with the frame to frame with his brilliant execution skill and a knack for pleasing the viewers through its amazing visuals and camera work. The voice given by the actors seems apt especially by Vin Diesel as The Iron Giant, Jennifer Aniston and James Gammon. \n\nThe Iron Giant is giant at heart that resides within a childlike relationship among two individuals that just like the protagonist, seeks for its own parts in bits and pieces.",

Even though The Iron Giant is from 1999, it holds up thanks to its hand drawn animation. Bird pays tribute to Richard Donner's Superman and Steven Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial with The Iron Giant. It remains a wonderful watch for families everywhere. I recommend The Theatrical Version instead of The Signature Edition that only adds one unnecessary scene.\n\nThe casting is incredibly spot on for the voice actors. Eli Marienthal is believable as the thoughtful child hero Hogarth Hughes. Jennifer Aniston is so sweet and real as the mother. Vin Diesel is so likable as The Iron Giant. Harry Connick Jr. plays the kindly Dean with a sincere care rare in voice acting. Finally, Christopher McDonald is perfectly hateful as the government agent Kent. I really think this vocal ensemble is some of the most apt voice casting ever.\n\nThis is a fast paced, short movie that will captivate you. It has a lot of laughs and sweet character moments. It builds a realistic world that you can believe as Maine in 1957. The themes of compassion and understanding are universally relatable. The moral parables of using empathy and choosing goodness are important to learn for any child. It even teaches children about death and mortality in a thoughtful and gentle manner. I implore parents to show The Iron Giant to their kids.\n\nI urge audiences to watch The Iron Giant. It is an animated classic.",

Because some things simply fly over the heads of the youth that's why it's so much fun to watch such films again a few years later when you can enjoy them again with a completely different look, but it was still presented interesting enough that he aroused the interest of one.\n(PS: For a change we have a movie without a villain but just people with different opinions and views) \n\nI'm pretty impressed with love, music and animation. I do not think it's too bad that we have too much 3D animation movies but most movies and I mean films in general are bland and they're just too different.\nThis topic already looks like a lost art because such films are no longer made these days.\nIf you made a live-action movie out of it then only Steven Spielberg would have the talent and experience to get close to this result. With a \"PG-13\"? I'm not 100% sure because we know that Spielberg can also press on the violence Tube, when I think of the scenes in which the robot goes rampage, I wonder if Spielberg would hold back nowadays.\n\nBrad Bird is just an artist and a genius. Not only do we have a movie with a realistic kids character that is not a bit annoying, but we have real family drama but not the embarrassing way of today's reality TV of all Kardashian scrap, proper social criticism but the message of the movie is not going to be that extreme beaten whit a Sledgehammer so that it is the movie enjoyment in the way. And I was fascinated as a little boy by the mother (Annie Hugher).\nAs a child, I have seen very few animated films because I find them just too childish, uninteresting and too good. Besides, the constant musical numbers just annoyed me. Thankfully, this movie has none of this * and I love it *.\n(Of course not every movie needs sex, violence and cussing\nbut not every movie has to be like a fairy tale)\n\nI have never had to cry at a movie, but this is one of the few movies where not much is missing to open my locks.\n\nHowever, my heart always is.\n\nThis is one of the smartest movies I've ever seen in my life.\nUnfortunately, he is a dying race, both in terms of style and genre, one more reason to keep the movie in his honor and show it to as many people as possible.\n\nI thank you for your criticism and your super interesting videos quieter more often videos about movies from the nostalgia department I'm curious what other people say about it and if maybe there is not one or the other movie of which I have not heard.",

The film is about a giant metal machine that drops from the sky and frightens a small town in Maine in 1958, only to find a friend named, Hogarth, that ultimately finds its humanity and saving the towns people of their fears and prejudices.\n\nI remember watching this as a kid and being in love with it. Its beautiful animation, its joyous laughs, the fun characters, and a big lovable giant. I feel like this was the \"Big Hero 6\" of the 1990's. What's not to like about this film? Not only is it a classic animation, but it's genuinely just an all around great film.\n\nBrad Bird has delivered plenty of great films throughout his lifetime. However, what we have here MIGHT be one of my favorite films that he's ever created. I don't know if it is, but it's damn near close. One of my favorite things about this story is honestly the simplicity of it. A young boy befriends an Iron Giant from outer space, wondering how he'll fit into society and how other people will view him. It's a simple, fun, adventurous premise that knows what it is and executes. It's a fun story that I think everyone can enjoy, but it has some really nice themes inside that I think are really beneficial for younger generations.\n\nI forgot just how funny this film was because I had some genuinely good laughs throughout. I was smiling for most the film and laughing throughout the rest. It's just fun and that's the best word I can use to describe it. One of my favorite feelings is to be able to watch a film from my childhood and still smile at just how much I love it. There was a lot of nostalgia in watching it and the fact that it also holds up really well is a pleasant aspect.\n\nPurchasing the newly released blu-ray for the re-release of this film, I've got to say that it looks pretty damn good. The animation looks like how it was back then (an older cartoon), but the animation is really fluid, the environments are well developed, and the characters look great. The film looks great and I feel like with all of these different aspects combined, it'll help this film last throughout the years. \n\nTalk about voice actors. I legitimately thought Eli Marienthal was phenomenal. He brought so much to his role and made his character so fun. His emotions and excitement made it seem like he was a real kid living out this scenario. Him, along with the rest of the talent all did great. They all bring so much fun and personality just with their voices and it makes the experience so much more fun.\n\nIn the end, \"The Iron Giant\" is a favorite and certainly a classic animation.",

It was an enjoyable film, however, I didn't feel as intrigued with the story as much as I would have liked to be. However, the film was insightful as to the fear and the threats that people experienced during the Cold War. The threat of nuclear bombing, and kids having to be taught how to protect themselves should a bombing occur was the reality then, and a scary one at that. \n\nThe film \"The Iron Giant\" fits into the animation genre in a different capacity. Nowadays, we are so used to the Disney/Pixar style of animation that is more vibrant and lively, where the style of animation that \"The Iron Giant\" employs is more of a classic animation. It reminds me of how movies like \"Lady and the Tramp\" and \"The Rescuers\" were animated. To me, I feel that the animation style used fits the tone of the movie, in that the movie isn't happy go lucky, so much as it is on the darker side with the subject matter that it explores.\n\nI feel that \"The Iron Giant\" could have done better with some sound editing changes. It might have just been my TV, but it felt like the dialogue of the movie and the sound effects of the movie were on two completely different levels and I had to constantly adjust my volume. I also felt that Kent the detective staying at Hogarth's house kind of came out of nowhere. It felt bizarre to me that a single mom would all of a sudden let this random man spend so much time in her house with her only child.\n\nI did appreciate the character evolution of the giant. It was great to see how he handled different situations. When Hogarth and the giant were playing in the metal yard, Hogarth points a toy gun at the giant and the giant reacts how he was programmed to, which is to destroy any threats. By the end of the movie, as the giant is flying in the sky trying to protect Hogarth from the army that is chasing them, one of the planes fires at the two of them and the giant's eyes start to narrow, as if to shoot his laser at the planes. Instead, the giant holds back, realizing that that isn't the way to handle the situation. I watched the film many times as a kid, and that was a piece that I had never noticed until now!",

When what we see doesn't scare us when we have seen and heard everything to be scared about. When we need to see the worst that could happen to prepare ourselves. When somethings we see are unexplainable when it's not what we normally see. When we have people to see and investigate to see could cause strange occurences before it starts a panic. When we see things could be extremely bad others see us as good to follow. When we see we are harmless and different that nobody else could believe exist. When we only see the signs to know something is out there. When what we don't normally see we need to know more about when we need to communicate. When there is a wide spread of media that makes us see and know the world. When every indication shows somethings out of the blue surfacing when they are not what we normally see to stir panic, hoax, hysteria and questions. When we see other things from another world are meant to do good things to see their is hope and chance for everyone different, until then we need to remain hidden from sight. When there is plenty to be alert about when everything we see is hip and trendy. When not many people we see are like us when we are more welcoming then others. When what others see as trouble we see an asset for help, a threat to destroy, and a friend to play with. When we see what others see to have proof that something foreign does exist. When not many can see what we see to come in contact with another life and make it feel at home. When we see everything is not all different when we make them see they have more then what meets the eye when it has feelings. When what others learn and see what is right and wrong they know how to see life. When we don't see how threats and panic can bring families closer to understand what is good and what is bad to see how we deal with things that are foreign to us and welcome them as part of a greater family in our country, community and hearts. When we don't always know what we are meant to be or our purpose in life when some paths we take can lead us to where we are thinking we are heading or change course and be something else.

Love the way your marketing schemes worked back in the 90's,Warner Bros. The Iron Giant is actually pretty good. The animation is nice to look at and manages to focus on themes of fear of the unknown and \"you are who you choose to be\". It gets emotional near the climax but I'm not spoiling anything, just guess and wonder if you're right. The film helped establish Brad Bird's cinematic gifts and boasts memorable moments especially when the robot says \"Superman\". I can understand why people jokingly call it the most underrated Superman movie of all time. It's funny, it's dramatic and there's also some great attention to detail. It feels accurate for a 1950s setting seeing as how the main villain most of the time smokes a cigarette, there are some 50s type comics and the army is shown to be paranoid true to a world still living in the Cold War. Heck, even the posters look 1950s-ish. Good job, Brad Bird. No wonder The Incredibles and Ratatouille are so good. I'd definitely want to be friends with this harmless albeit menacing-looking at first glance giant robot from outer space.",

Needless to say, as I watched the movie (I cannot recall what movie it was) I was more excited for the Iron Giant than the actual movie we were seeing. I remember opening up the wrapping paper and yelling with joy that I had gotten the movie. I ran around the living room holding out while laughing and shouting. I immediately popped the tape in to watch it after the unwrapping had finished. As a 5 year old, the actual impact of the movie was lost on me and it was merely an entertaining animated film. As I grew and watched the movie many more times it's true gravity began to dawn on me. This movie has gotten me threw many rough times as a very depressed and lonely teenager and has even gone to college with me. This one of my go to movies if I ever feel sad. The whole aspect of unconditional love for someone is beautiful and the ending (I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it the whole way through) is, frankly, heartbreaking. Fast forward to Christmas this year 2016. As I ripped open the wrapping paper, the now 22 year old me, smiled as I held the DVD of the Iron Giant in my hands. I didn't scream or yell this time, but it really touched me deep down that even today a whole 17 years later, this movie still moves me, sometimes to the point of tears. If you haven't watched this movie, I suggest it with my whole heart. It's truly a cinematic masterpiece.",

It's so wonderful to have the small-town 1950's vibe for the warm beginning that's all about making a new friend. But it also transitions well into the fear and paranoia that many felt at the time because of the Bomb and the Red Scare. Hogarth is a simple inquisitive kid, which is a good protagonist for our story, and it makes him easy to identify with. I have to say, the establishment of the friendship between Hogarth and the Giant is a little rushed, but I think it's justified because they set him up in the beginning as a boy who quickly grows attached to creatures. Speaking of setting things up, on a rewatch I was amazed how blatantly they foreshadow the climax of the film. I didn't see it coming the first time, but they start laying the groundwork for how the story will end 30 minutes or less into the movie. Some people might not like how obvious the foreshadowing is, but I think most of it is solidly built into the plot with appropriate setup and pay-off. And that pay-off is the kind that makes grown men weep. I don't just tear up or get a little misty-eyed with The Iron Giant, I have tears rolling down my face every time. Clearly the film connects with me in a deep way to elicit that kind of reaction. All this, and it has a good moral message as well, which both adults and children can learn from. I love this movie, and would highly recommend it to anyone.",

The film is also sort of anti-war in a way in the way that the film ends. I thought the film was visually stunning, I enjoyed all of the characters, and I thought the concept of the movie was genius. My only gripe with it was the final shot of the film which really takes the tragic ending and gives it a happy go lucky feel that doesn't do that anti-war, pro-acceptance message any justice.

E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial right? Yes, and no. Though very similar and a lot less content worries, The Iron Giant, set in the 1950s when the Russians had just deployed the Sputnik into space, distinguishes itself from E.T. by one, 100 ft. metal man.\nSent from outer space to be \"a weapon\" to destroy humans, the Iron Giant is remarkably friendly to humans. \n\nHe soon befriends an 11 year-old pet-addicted boy, Hogarth, who had saved him from a close-to-death electrocution during the Giant's feast on the metal of an electric station. Lonely for a companion, Hogarth visits the Giant and teaches him about the world. Thus begins the mental journey of the Iron Giant into the world of humans. \n\nMeanwhile, the government is called up about some weird discoveries. They send an agent by the name of Kent Mansley to investigate. He first dismisses the idea of a metal-eating Giant as too eccentric, but then after finding his car with a huge bite and a second later vanished completely, he calls the government which instructs him to find more evidence. Immediately, Kent suspects Hogarth and after many annoying and desperate inquiries he discovers a picture of Hogarth and the Giant. The next day, the army is in their backyard.\n\nThe Iron Giant, rated PG for some violence, some bathroom humor and a bunch too many mild swears and misuses of God's name, is both hilarious but also heartbreaking, yet unlike many animation films, viewers will find its message comparably heavy and touching deeply on the truth of death and souls. There is one thing I disliked though. All the scenes are straight to the point, but I hoped it could have added 15 minutes of fluff and still prove the important points without the blink-and-you-miss-it (you will see some in the re-release of it in theaters and and digital). Frankly, although the story is not new to most of us, The Iron Giant easily bests the others in creativity and spiritual truth (but not all on family-friendly content). Just as Hogarth says to the Giant, \"You don't have to be a gun. You are what you choose to be,\" we should not base ourselves on what others believe and want us to be. \"Superman...\"\n\nNote: The Iron Giant, the directorial debut for Brad Bird, will be re-released in theatres with new footage only on September 30 (too late by the time you read this article), an encore on October 4 and a release on DVD in the fall.",

Great animation and I love how they pay great attention to detail to set this film in the '50s - everything from  the animation to music to the magazine to the shows & commercials on TV...even to his little alien defense pistol.  Great old school score to convey the mood of each scene.  Deep undertones of fear of the unknown and that fear leading to violence when, in reality, the robot is nothing but in innocent child at heart.  Also demonstrates themes such as \"your destiny is what you make of it\" as well as making the ultimate sacrifice for your loved ones.  I do believe he didn't actually have to sacrifice completely at the end, but that's a minor issue in this particular film.\n\nGrade = 8.5/10",

It has the best animation I have seen out of any film of its genre, and anyone \nof any age will enjoy watching it from start to finish. The Iron Giant is a friendly and genuine giant robot whose is kind to everyone (or almost everyone) he meets, and his character develops gradually throughout the film. It is impossible not to relate to the Iron Giant in some way, from being such a wonderful character.  Remarkable and highly memorable family film!",

This is the first Brad Bird film that didn't really grab me. I found the script lacklustre, and the plot predicatable.\n\nThe premise is simple: a space robot lands on earth and befriends the standard-issue precocious child. He behaves as a gentle giant, learning our Earth ways until threatened by the military, where he only starts hurting people in self-defense. When humanity uses unnecessarily strong force, he must revert to the kind soul that he truly is and sacrifice himself.\n\nIf the complexities of your plot can be boiled down to less than sixty words without losing the idea of the movie, I don't feel its complex enough to warrant a better rating. Yes, this will entertain kids, but grown-ups can't expect a lot of zippy one-liners or hidden references (unlike Brad Bird's other films).",

The story is great, as is the animation and voice acting.  Everything comes together perfectly for a classic film!\n\n- What a fantastic movie!  I hadn't seen it before.  Brad Bird is a cut-above the rest in my opinion. This movie is stylistic and has a great story.  Check it out if you've never seen it.",

And it's got a huge giant metal man voiced by Vin Diesel, so there's that.\n\nThe dialogue is clever, the characters are snappy and witty, and the titular giant is one of animated film's most under-appreciated heroes. \n\nIt's hard to find much wrong with the film. Brad Bird would go on to do so much with Pixar, but I hope someday he might return to direct another hand-drawn feature. He's got the magic touch.",

I thoroughly enjoyed the film, and it boasts some great animation, effective direction that keeps you entertained with its story, which is pretty simple, and in doing that, we have something quite charming, funny, entertaining and of course memorable. This is a fine piece of animation, a film that really is well done in the way they delivered its ideas, and it is an enthralling, wonderful movie that I recommend to any viewer that enjoys a solid animated feature. The Iron Giant boasts a great cast of varied voice talent, and they brilliantly bring these characters to life. The film isn't your typical animated features such as the computer animated ventures of Pixar, and this one venture more in the cartoon department, but it does it very well that it can appeal to any age group. The film is tailored to anyone that enjoys a fun, entertaining picture that is beautiful to look at and is engaging from start to finish. This is a great movie, one that should be enjoyed by anyone that loves a solid animated feature. The Iron Giant is terrific for what it does, and with its simple ideas, we have a film that accomplishes much more than what we would get than your usual film that overdoes everything in order to grab the viewer's attention. Sometimes all you need is a simple idea, great direction, a well crafted story to make a very good film, and with The Iron Giant, we have such a film.",

An alien robot sent to destroy earth it lands in New England, but the landing damages its programming, and it has no memory. The 1950s setting is so great here, because it is the height of paranoia from the cold war and outer space invaders. A lonely boy discovers him, teaches him and forms a genuine friendship with the giant. Even though he is a walking weapon, the boy teaches him that who you are who you choose to be. Their interactions along with the animation style give the giant a soul and make him feel as lovable as a pet dog. It is a touching story with an emotional ending that resonates.

The characters are memorable and The Giant is one of the most iconic animated characters ever. The animation is fantastic and makes me realize how much I miss traditional animated movies nowadays. It's also pretty mature for a kids movie, touching on themes of existentialism, nuclear war, and death. I know it's probably not the first family movie to do that but I think this one does it better than most others, maybe even the best. And the last twenty minutes of the movie is one of the greatest climaxes to a movie I've ever seen, it is packed action, suspense, and emotion and brings the movie to an extremely satisfying end.

And impossible to not root against the long-faced (literally) government agent who can only believe that the Iron Giant can be a weapon.\n\nThe movie also has an awesome retro feel to it.  The film reel demonstrating the proper duck-and-cover response to a nuclear attack drill is especially hilarious.\n\nFinal Say: An absolute must-watch if you like animation or giant robots, if just for the scene when the Iron Giant gets angry.\n\nHow to Watch It: Just because there's a giant robot, don't go in expecting a ton of action/fighting.  You know any movie made today with a giant robot would have tons of that.  But this one isn't about explosions so much as... dare I say it? ... relationships.\n\nTrivia: The first film by Brad Bird, who later wrote/directed Pixar's The Incredibles and Ratatouille.",

            "content": "The Iron giant is a well-written, smart and emotionally satisfying movie that also has more to say than your usual animated flick. Set in the year 1957, it is at bottom a touching story of a young boy and his heartfelt friendship with an extra-terrestrial space robot, but it also serves as a cold war parable, in which the fear of nuclear holocaust and a sense of paranoia is prevalent, and the robot must learn to transcend his assigned function as a lethal weapon. \r\nThe conception of the metallic space alien(voiced by Vin Diesel) is inspired. Somewhat reminiscent of E.T the iron giant is simple-natured and innocent with a very limited vocabulary. Despite being cautious at first a young boy named Hogarth Hughes(voiced by  Eli Marienthal)  befriends this creature and begins to think of his new robot alien pal as his equal, at once a larger species of a child and a faithful pet. A local junk dealer/beaknik artist(voice of Harry Connick Jr.) is also won over by the charms of the giant. The design of the robot is spot-on, expressive without ever being too cutesy. Hot on the trail of Hogarth and his giant is Kent Mansley, a malevolent 1950's version of special government agent(voiced by Christopher McDonald). Clad in the requisite trench-coat, Mansley makes for an interesting and comical villain, representing xenophobic authority and irrational paranoia. The animation is great, evoking classic Disney or studio Ghibli in its close attention to detail. The old-school design of the human characters, often with imperfect faces and big goofy ears, has a lot more charm than most modern computer-animated movies. This movie is genuinely touching and funny and doesn't really put a foot wrong throughout.",

            "content": "Animation filmmaking is one area I don't touch on frequently. The genre does interest me, but very rarely do I personally feel that its even taken advantage to its full potential. What's often categorize as a family friendly genre can visualize a greater connection to reality that wouldn't be captured the same way in a live action film. \"The Iron Giant\" is one of those films that in live action form special effects regardless of quality would have distracted from the true heart and power within its story and characters.\r\n\r\nThe Iron Giant is about a boy befriending an innocent giant robot that a paranoid government agent wants to destroy. Structurally \"The Iron Giant\" plays out similar to another classic \"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial\"; in both a kid encounters a begin from space, befriends the space begin who is stranded on earth, takes it home and hides it from his mother (yet oddly in both film there's no father present), and the paranoid government come into play. While both films share similar plot threads and aside from sharing the same quality that's where the comparison between these two films end. Characters are sophisticated and their interactions with one another feels natural. Conversations never allude to anything specifically plot related every moment of humor and drama is a genuine occurrence in these characters everyday life. Both the human characters and our giant robot are treated as equal. Instead of seeing the iron giant as a piece of machinery we see the iron giant as a living being. Identifying with the iron giant as much as we do with the human characters. Giving events a greater sense of emotion, a greater sense of importance, and more involving seeing every outcome. \r\n\r\nPolitical commentary is risking especially in this film when the setting is just days after the Russians launched the Sputnik satellite. The atmosphere is tense and paranoid in this time setting. What the iron giant metaphors is easy to grasp with scenes hinting perhaps this other worldly creation has a different function. Later on sending a message about being a weapon through key development scenes. Unlike the humans we never learn about the iron giant past or purpose. Like a weapon we presume the intention is a path of destruction. If the iron giant was never given any human traits this would have been a cautionary tale about humans thrive for creating weapons eventually killing them. In this film we have a giant robot who is programmed to do a specific function. However, his interactions define his decision and questions what he was program to do. It's as much the iron giant story to not follow a set path programmed for him as much as it is a our human character story on the escalation of fearing the unknown. \r\n\r\nAnimation mixes hand-drawn imagery coupled with a computer-generated iron giant. The title character is a 3D composition done digitally, mixed with the 2D action surrounding him. There are some highly imaginative shots of the robot mixing in with the film's environment with aura of an classic sci-fi feel surrounding him and his design. Detail is evident in the whole: the season subtly changes from fall to winter; the characters are always doing something, even if they aren't directly in focus; in some parts of the movie the little details actually become crucial to the movie's strength and validity. Character designs and voice actors who made them come to life verbally were perfect. Eli Marienthal fitted very well with the animated design of the character. Harry Connick Jr. was just as good at being humorous. Kent Mansley, our main antagonist, was very well designed and acted. Christopher McDonald relatively calm voice made the villain memorable. The Iron Giant himself is voiced by Vin Diesel. While Diesel says very little he sounds exactly like a robot, but hints slightly of perhaps adopting a speaking pattern to that of a human. \r\n\r\nThe Iron Giant is a masterpiece. Transcending beyond an hand drawn two dimensional plain to provide three dimensional characters whose interaction are so natural you don't feel like you're watching a piece of vividly drawn fiction.",

For being Bard Bird's first direct picture, \"The Iron Giant\" is a engaging, effecting, and charming animated adventure that animated pictures need to be a little more like this or at least once in a while.\nI never liked this movie before, I don't know why?

The movie is complexed on relationship, where everyone has feeling and heart. \"The Iron Giant\" is in so far the best tradition of Warner Bros and it is a big heart movie that has likable characters, and easy to know voice work, and nice way to set it in the cold war to be a well and memorable film from Brad Bird.",

No heart prods here! My one problem would be the villain, who came close at times to be a true embodiment of the ultra-nationalist McCarthy Paranoid the era produced. No, he was there, and interesting for that. Then at the end they tried to distance him from that. (\"Screw America, I want to live!) A dding a little more gray to the character would have really captured the sort of people fostered by that time. If he had been a truly terrified individual, expecting the worse because of the extreme paranoia fostered by the Cold War, it would have complimented the story of the two 'enemies' reaching a friendship and understanding in Giant and Hogart. \n\nThe animation is of course Brad Bird Awesome.",

            "content": "One of the recent directors in Hollywood that I enjoy watching is the films of Brad Bird. Bird started out as a successful animation director with the acclaimed Pixar hits The Incredibles and Ratatouille, and then ventured into live-action territory by reviving the Mission Impossible franchise. His upcoming project, Tomorrowland, sounds like it's going to be another excellent masterpiece from Bird. But what shocks me is that before this review, I have never seen Bird's directorial debut, The Iron Giant. I had heard about it for quite some time. I knew it was a huge flop at the box-office, but gained massive acclaim from critics and gained a cult following from audiences after Bird became an acclaimed filmmaker. Now after watching The Iron Giant, I'm surprised that I didn't watch it sooner, cause it's incredible.\n\nSet in 50's Cold War America, shortly after the launch of Sputnik, we meet the child Hogarth, who longs for a pet. He soon finds a pet larger than expected when me discovers a 50-foot giant who came from space. Knowing that the world will panic when they discover its existence, Hogarth hides the robot in the junkyard of beatnik friend Dean. But of coarse, a 50-foot robot cannot hide forever, and soon enough, a government agent comes down to investigate weird occurrences, and believing it to be a threat caused by the Russians, sends the military to wipe the robot from existence. Hogarth, knowing that the robot is a friend, sets out to convince everyone that the creature is good, not bad.\n\nWhen watching The Iron Giant, I couldn't help but think of how similar this is to Spielberg's ET. Both films are about a lonely child, they both meet a creature from the unknown, they both develop a close bond, and both childs in the film have to protect the alien from government/military. While ET is far superior when it comes to raw emotions and depth, that doesn't mean that this film is a massive disaster. No, no, and no. In actuality, I found The Iron Giant to be an impressive feature as well.\n\nThe 2D animation here is not the greatest animation I've seen, I admit. You'd think that this film was actually made in the 1950\"s.  Looking at it, I think the producers were deliberately making the animation look like 50's animation in order to better suit the film. And with that being said, the retro look of the film is outstanding. The giant is clearly CG, but the retro 2D animation makes him look old-fashioned, and I'm wowed. It makes me wonder that if the film was a massive smash, then The Incredibles might have been in 2D animation. Would have been a whole different film, for good or bad reasons.\n\nFor a film about Cold War fears, this film is surprisingly funny. Scenes with the boy and the giant have a sense of childhood fun in them, and I couldn't help but reminisce about my childhood fun watching this. I laughed hysterically at a scene where the boy was about to pray for the food and yells at the giant's missing hand while attempting to pray in front of his mom. It's a riot. Another scene that got me going was a scene where the robot makes a cannonball in a large pond and all the water starts flying out. It's great humor.\n\nThe characters were also a highlight in this film. The boy, Hogarth, voiced by Eli Marienthal, is surprisingly not annoying. Generally in films, particularly cartoons, kids in these films are usually annoying or extremely obnoxious, but here, Marienthal makes the voice of the child be reminiscent of how we all were when we were kids. The producers picked a well-acted kid for this. Vin Diesel voices the giant, and is pretty memorable. Jennifer Anniston voices the mom, and is strong in the role. She makes a mom that makes me wish that all moms are like this in today's society. Harry Connick Jr. voices the beatnik junk dealer, and is very funny. And Christopher McDonald voices the hysterical government agent, and is also very funny, while also sinister in several places. In some moments, it sounds like McDonald was imitating Henry Fonda, but Fonda never played a government agent that goes crazy. He was always the honest man who saves the day in the end. This character is not him. Again, don't know why I made the Henry Fonda comparison, but it's just me.\n\nThe score is provided by Michael Kamen, and it's pretty impressive. It might not be a masterpiece score, but at least Kamen provides emotions that are not underused. The climax really delivers in emotions in the music, when the giant becomes his true potential.\n\nIf there was one thing that bothered me about the film, it would have to be the film's message about guns. If you know me well, I strongly believe that we all have the right to carry guns, as stated in the Second Amendment. In the film, there's a scene where a deer is killed by some hunters, and the boy then tells the giant, \"Guns kill. You are not a gun.\" It seems to me that the producers believe that killing deer is bad and guns are bad, period. I believe this gives kids a bad message that you shouldn't kill deer or even hunt in that matter. Even though I'm not a hunter, I believe that these people need to eat something, and deer is in fact good food. Maybe the producers were scarred by the death of Bambi's mother. That didn't bother me, and I still support the hunters.\n\nWhile I was a bit annoyed by the whole anti-gun hunting deer thing, The Iron Giant is actually a strong animated film. The retro look of 50's America is outstanding, the emotions are strong, the comedy is in fact funny, and I was still rooting for the giant even if he's against guns. Besides the whole gun thing, the other message, where \"you are who you choose to be\", is in fact one of the strongest positive messages I've seen in an animation film and because of this, I strongly recommend that you watch The Iron Giant at least once, even if the anti-gun message carries through the better message.",

Heck, the only probable reason people dont talk about it much today is because its not from Disney. But I digress, it's still a complete masterpiece for what it is. The characters are all memorable, the dialogue is near perfect, and never really do you know where the story is going throughout, unless you're an expert on film. The only part I didn't like so much is the whole \"guns kill, you dont have to be a gun\" part which felt to me like it had a double meaning delving into politics that didnt really belong here. It's still one of the greatest usage of your time for animation and its so mature that it would probably work for live action as well. The plot is sort of similar to the latter Lilo and Stitch, but this works much better. It's mature, it's adult, it's funny, it's practically what it means to be a movie made for general audiences.",

For someone's debut film, I thought it was particularly impressive considering this is the same guy who would later make THE INCREDIBLES and MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL. He shows a firm directorial hand and gets excellent voice performances from the talent involved. It also helps that the story is very streamlined, so there aren't any pacing issues. The story also takes a rather poignant turn in the end that is completely earned. If I had to pick a single favorite moment from the film, it would probably be the end. Overall, THE IRON GIANT is a touching children's film with a heavy dose of nostalgia for a simpler time. This is a great film that can be enjoyed by parents and children alike.",

            "content": "It was high time that I watched Brad Bird's directional debut. I have absolutely loved each and every one of his movies, but for some strange reason, I never saw The Iron Giant. After many recommendations, I decided to give it a shot. The Iron Giant is a very good movie. Not a great movie. In an odd way, the reason why the movie is good is because of Brad Bird; but the reason why it is slightly disappointing is because of...Brad Bird. With The Incredibles, Ratatouille, and Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol, I became accustomed to an incredibly high level of filmmaking. Basically, Bird's last 3 movies have been nearly flawless. Which is what makes The Iron Giant somewhat disappointing, there are flaws.\r\n\r\nIt's 1957 in the sleepy town of Rockwell, Maine. A giant alien robot lands on Earth. The town's locals start perpetrating mysterious rumors about this giant machine. None of the townspeople have caught more than a glimpse of this robot, until adventurous Hogarth Hughes not only sees the robot, but befriends him. Everything is fine, but then the Feds show up. Kent Mansley (who works for the Government) is sent to Rockwell to investigate the strange happenings.\r\n\r\nThe cast is filled out with a likeable group of actors. Eli Marienthal voices Hogarth and gives him an energetic and inquisitive personality. His espresso fueled rant is without a doubt the funniest things in the movie! And for the most part he is a likable hero. Harry Connick, Jr. of Jazz music fame plays Dean, the main, adult protagonist. I think Dean is my favorite character in the movie, mostly because he reacts like how I would to the giant. And lastly, Christopher McDonald gives a very funny performance as Kent Mansley. I didn't like how the character was written towards the end, but he is still hilarious!\r\n\r\nNow on to what I didn't like about the movie. Number 1, and this is a big one, the movie makes no attempt to tell us why the Iron Giant was sent to earth. Was he sent to destroy the world? End violence? Obliterate all weapons? Or was he sent to earth for some completely different reason while still being equipped with heavy weaponry. The movie doesn't tell us, and therefore I couldn't root for the Giant as much as I wanted too. I personally wouldn't want a robot roaming around whose primary mission is to destroy the world or destroy weapons. But then, of course, the Iron Giant may or may not have disobeyed his mission when he decided that he didn't want to kill people. And right there we have another problem. Once the massive robot who could easily overpower us realizes his existence and gets a mind of his own, then there is immense danger there as well. As much as I hated to admit, if I were in the government's shoes, it would be very hard not to admit the obvious danger of keeping the giant around.\r\n\r\nI also wasn't a big fan of the visual style of the movie. In all fairness, if Brad Bird wasn't the guy directing this, then the visuals wouldn't even be an issue. I guess I was completely spoiled by Bird's other two animated efforts, The Incredibles and Ratatouille. Both of those movies had extremely strong visuals. Whether it was the super stylish look of Paris in Ratatouille, or the 'future as seen from the 1960s' from The Incredibles; both of these movies packed a strong visual punch. By comparison, the visual feel of The Iron Giant boarders on dull. It's not very colorful. It stays rather standard from start to finish. Based on the setting and the characters, I guess this movie simply didn't afford Bird the creative freedom of his later efforts.\r\n\r\nAnother big thing I didn't like was the theme of the movie, i.e. the anti-gun message. The movie heavy-handedly points out that, \"Guns kill,\" \"You don't have to be a gun.\" As if guns are the worst things in the world. I firmly believe that if you take guns out of the hands of the citizens, then the worst people will still manage to get their hands on firearms. I believe in Second Amendment rights. Still, I was happy with the way the movie didn't depict the military as the villains. General Rogard is even shown as smart and rational guy.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other odds and ends that I wasn't a fan of. I believe the movie alienates some of the younger audience members with the fact that there is mild language in the movie. It's nothing that a 10 year old couldn't handle, but I'm sure that a lot of parents wouldn't want their 5 and 6 year olds exposed to it. Another thing I didn't like was the lack of personality given to Hogarth's mom. She is a completely typical character.\r\n\r\nWith all this negative talk about the movie, I don't want to make it seem like I don't like it. I just feel that I have to explain why I'm giving a movie with a 97% approval rating, a movie considered one of the best animated movies of all time, a lowered rating. Even with the elements that I didn't like, The Iron Giant is still a highly entertaining, endearing, mature, and largely well made animated movie. I like it, but I don't love it. Compared to your average animated fare, this is definitely above average. Compared to your average Brad Bird fare, this is definitely below average.\r\n\r\n\"You know, this sort of thing is why it's important to always chew your food.\" 7.5/10",

Not because you're dreading it.  Just because you mean to and somehow don't.  This isn't \"oh, I heard that was terrible\" or \"well, I hear good things, but it doesn't sound like my deal.\"  This is \"yeah, I'll get to it.\"  The thing people don't seem to realize is that there are a lot of movies out there.  There are even a lot of good movies out there.  In genres I like.  And okay, I still spend a certain amount of time watching bad movies.  Even [i]re[/i]watching bad movies, which is a whole other issue that I'm vaguely embarrassed about.  However, the more I heard about this movie, the more I figured I'd probably like it.  So okay, it has been sitting on our shelf for I don't actually know how long.  Years, probably.  And since I've basically run out of library DVDs and can't find the two I have from Netflix, here we were.\r\n\r\nHogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal) is a relatively ordinary kid growing up in a small town in Maine.  His father was a fighter pilot and is dead; he lives alone with his mother, Annie (Jennifer Aniston), a waitress in a diner.  One day, as Sputnik orbits the Earth, he is sitting up watching TV while his mother is at work.  The TV stops working.  The power goes all wonky.  And Hogarth goes out into the night to find out what's going on, because he's an intrepid kid that way.  And what he sees is, well, an Iron Giant (Vin Diesel).  He befriends it, as kids in this setting are wont to do, and but he quickly realizes that he needs to hide his new friend from, like, everyone.  Someone, however, has seen it and has summoned The Government, in the person of Kent Mansley (Christopher McDonald).  Kent wants the recognition that finding an alien invader would bring.  Meanwhile, Hogarth enlists the help of local metal artist Dean McCoppin (Harry Connick, Jr.) to hide his friend.\r\n\r\nDirector Brad Bird also made my favourite Pixar film (if not actually the best), [i]The Incredibles[/i].  There are some distinct similarities between the two films; both draw on a certain retro-futuristic feel.  While both have a lot of science fiction trappings, both are really more about the people than the tech.  Even the eponymous giant is really more developed as a character than just treated as Technology.  Yes, okay, there are those drones in [i]The Incredibles[/i], but they're a product of a certain pattern of thought and can be seen, in an odd way, as an insight into the mind of the villain.  Still, we don't even have that distance here.  There are a bunch of townspeople who are mostly there to make the town picturesque and period, but any time we interact with one of them, they have at least the glimmering of personality.  We don't know how the Giant works, but we don't have to; the point is not what he is but who he is.\r\n\r\nYeah, okay, there are also a few anachronisms, such as the idea that the Giant might be a \"downed satellite,\" given that there was, at the time, only one satellite and everyone would know if it were down.  Okay.  Most of the anachronisms would have been pretty easy to fix, too.  However, some of them were \"this car is from the wrong year,\" which I must confess I would not have noticed on my own, not being a car person.  (Actually, the word \"beatnik\" is apparently an anachronism, which I should have noticed and wouldn't have.)  However, there were none that I found particularly glaring, which is unusual for a movie of this sort.  It feels as though they were actually trying; after all, they made the cars recognizable sorts, which there is really no need to do.  I think most of us, including the film's target audience of, you know, children, would have been okay with \"generic '50s-looking car.\"  As it turns out, it probably would have been better if they'd left it that way, but whatever.\r\n\r\nMy plan for when my kid gets old enough to put DVDs in the player and watch them on his own is to put together all the ones he's allowed to watch without us on a separate shelf.  I don't know if this one will make it onto that shelf; there's some moderately scary stuff to it.  (The full version of the fake \"duck and cover\" cartoon is pretty horrific, actually.)  This is a decision you'd have to make on a kid-by-kid basis.  The film is rated PG, and for a reason.  When I was fairly young, this actually would have terrified me, but I am of an age where I was scared of nuclear war as a small child.  (That my parents watched a lot of news didn't much help with that.)  I can't say that children today (who don't see as much of the news) would feel that way.  Still, there's some sad stuff, some scary stuff, and some really unpleasant characters.  I really do feel that watching it first, or at bare minimum watching it with your kid, is a wise idea before letting your child see it alone.  Remember, not all animation is G-rated--or should be.",

Back when VCR still reigned supreme over home media, I'd see trailers of this film, and I was hesitant. I thought it looked uninteresting and it seemed as though everything you had to see was already in the trailer. Even if that's true, there's no denying that 'The Iron Giant' is unforgettable. Nice going, Warner Bros. for not realizing that you had pure gold in your hands. Another highlight would be the film's orchestral score and the work of the voice-actors--it was all well done, actually. I wish I could say that this film was part of my childhood but I didn't watch it until I was a bit older (6th grade-ish).",

What would you do if you found him? And I simply love comic-book villains, where you don't have to feel guilty about hating their guts. It was also refreshing that no part of the army was characterized as hellbent on destruction; the psycho-general plot device goes stagnant after a bit.\n\nLet's not forget the star of the show: a robot who mysteriously appears on earth and befriends the first creature he sees. He learns of life and death, and struggles with his place in the universe-especially as one capable, from bulk alone, of great destruction. He characterized Kirk's closing speech from Star Trek II: \"Of all the characters in this story, he was the most human.\" And that's the essence of sci-fi, isn't it; to remove us from ourselves so that we can better understand us.\n\nI lopped off a half-star because I thought the epilogue detracted from the point of the story, but I can appreciate the reason it was put in, especially in a children's movie. Overall, this was a better-than-excellent film, on par with anything Pixar's ever done, and I heartily recommend it.",

This film captures some compelling emotion from films like ET and Terminator 2 in ways I didn't imagine before. Everything in this film is done just right, and it's almost too big for me to even review. But to list an example, what stood out to me about this film was the reaction of the government, especially in this era. From an artistic point of view, this is EXACTLY how the government would react if an incident like this were to happen. Because we would naturally be afraid. Blinded by overwhelming size and power, they were unable to see the heart and innocence of the giant robot. Everything about this film worked, there was much character development and growth, all leading to a powerful ending. The animation was beautiful, the plot was excellent, and the scope was intriguing. There is more than one moral to to this story, and they are all important. And those morals are ones you must learn by watching the film yourself, there really isn't any other way to get it. One can't watch this film without at least getting one of them. It's not what I would call a kids movie, it works for just about everyone. If you like sci-fi and deep emotional conflicts, you will like this movie.

It was funny and has a good chemistry between Hogarth and Giant. What makes this so unique is that it wasn't too kid friendly at all. Instead, it appeals to everyone from young and old. \n\nThe story was pretty fun and had a heart. It flowed pretty well from start to finish without being cheesy. However, it had an ending where it makes you think that it should have a sequel, which it didn't. It's kinda similar to the way The Incredibles ended, except it ended differently. I love that movie as well. The humor was smart and imaginative. \n\nThe voice actors did pretty well, and I didn't know, at first, that the well-known cast voiced these memorable characters. Even though I'm not a fan of Vin Diesel, I thought he did a brilliant job with his character. Eli Marienthal was outstanding with his main character, and I think he should be in more movies. It's been a long time since I've heard from his projects. I was surprised about Christopher McDonald being one of the voice actors in this movie. He was funny in Happy Gilmore, and he made his character, Kent Mansley memorable here. Kent may be a jerk, but he had me laughing whenever he appears.\n\nThis is one of the animated films that should be appreciated by everyone. This movie is underrated, and it would have been better if enough people would like it for what it is. The ending could have been a little better, but it was brilliant for what it was. The Iron Giant will always be one of my favorite movies ever.",

Tackling heavy subjects such as death and nuclear warfare with a steady hand and heavy heart, but also featuring the humor needed to make a film of this style work. The animation is beautiful, with special mention going to the portrayal of the giant himself. It would have been simple to just animate a CG robot and plop it down into scenes with the characters, but the way the robot moves and is animated blends near-flawlessly with the hand-drawn animation surrounding it, so much so that I completely forgot that he was CG until after the film was over. And speaking of the giant, Vin Diesel does a spectacular job of bringing the character to life. While the giant has very few lines, they are delivered flawlessly, encompassing emotions ranging from happiness and wonder to sorrow and even anger. If you haven't seen The Iron Giant yet, then you are doing yourself a disservice by not doing so. It's some of the best that animation has to offer, on the same league as films such as Disney's Beauty and the Beast and Studio Ghibli's My Neighbor Totoro. \n\nThis film also features some of the earliest work of Lauren Faust, wife of Craig McCracken and creator of the mega-hit animated series My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.

Before long, however, a government agent is on their trail -- and he's intent on destroying the automaton.\r\n\r\nReleased in 1999, The Iron Giant couldn't have had worse timing.  After the rousing success of Toy Story just four years prior, as well as Pixar's equally exciting \"A Bug's Life\" follow up in 1998, animation's audience was eager to embrace computer generated images and must have looked at The Iron Giant as some form of regression.  The film bombed at the box office, failing to recoup even half of what it cost to produce; and the film quitely slipped into oblivion. \r\n\r\nThank goodness for the miracle of home video such as dvd.  As a result, the sins of the past need not be repeated and more and more people can discover this great animated film for themselves.  Pixar was wise to stand up and take notice of the film's quality by absorbing the competition and making Brad Bird (director of The Iron Giant) a part of Pixar.  The picture has stellar character development, surprisingly powerful images, and a script that tackles some oddball subjects such as gun control.\r\n\r\nIf the film has a downside it is it's relatively straightforward structure, making it somewhat predictable.  But such a flaw is rendered mute as we are treated to The Iron Giant's evocative period ambiance, great vocal talent, and heartfelt narrative.  \r\n\r\nThough the film is held back by it's typical structuring, The Iron Giant is a smart, earthbound, and warm family film.",

The Iron Giant is funny and Bird tells a great story about friendship and sacrifice. The Iron Giant is a small gem that has not been discovered by many but once you discover it, you will never forget it.\n\nFavorite Scene: The ending scene when The Iron Giant sacrifices himself",

Brad crafts a world that is definatly animated, but doesn't rely on the typical animated trops of the time, such as strechy characters and fart jokes, and makes characters that you care about, even so to the giant CG......giant! The story is perfectly crafted to leave you with tears in your eyes, no matter the age. No where does it stall and it even slightly pushes the boundaries of family entertainment a little further. The animated classics touch on themes like friendship and love, and this also does, but even more so by showing that just because others do, doesn't mean we have to fight. And that we could give ourselves up to help others. To simply put it, 'Iron Giant' is a giant, and one filled with heart and love. It teaches kids that friendship has no boundaries and that just how far you can go to protect the innocent. It will capture your heart, and while it has as big of an action scene as any trandformer movie, this robot has a lot more love. And you'll love him to. 5/5",

To say this film is anything less than one of the preeminent animated films of our time is to do it injustice. I do not believe any movie has been able to so deftly weave in a message as powerful as this one with a kid-friendly animated story. For a film about a \"giant metal man,\" The Iron Giant is anything but mechanical. This film, interestingly enough, explores topics very relevant to modern American foreign policy, despite its setting in 1958 during the Cold War when tensions were high with the Soviets. The Iron Giant portrays the US as a highly expansionistic, militaristic nation with interventionist tendencies, playing off of the common beliefs about nuclear war at the time. However, it manages to do so subtly enough that it never feels like it is preaching to its audience- while there is a powerful anti-war sentiment towards the end of the film, it doesn't go so far as to insult the military or degrade the nation as movies tackling this issue tend to do. And then, it even works as a sci-fi film, grabbing the attention of the audience from the get-go with an exciting, mysterious opening scene. Sci-fi? Politics? Family values? This movie has got it all. Hogarth (Marienthal), the protagonist, is an eleven-year-old child with a widow for a mother who has no real friends from school, and often entertains himself outdoors as his mother (Aniston) tries to earn a living. At first, the character almost seems annoying due to his mannerisms and chatty personality, but over time, it becomes apparent that he is absolutely a realistic portrayal of a child who has been left to his own devices, but is undeniably kind and gregarious in nature and who is only looking for companionship (and a father). Throughout the film, the audience is given more backstory to who he is and this allows us to empathisize with him, making the climax that much more gripping. The giant also manages to become an endearing character as the movie progresses, with subtle voice acting talent from Vin Diesel himself. I belive it is safe to say that this is the best thing Vin Diesel has ever done. That goes without saying- in fact, picking him to play the giant with a limited vocabulary ironically gave him the opportunity to be the most affecting. The Iron Giant's incredible relationship with Hogarth evolves as a classic story of friendship that is both organic and believable. A brilliant edition to the cast comes from Harry Connick, Jr., who plays the beat generation hipster Dean. His role is the shining star of the film. He could easily have been underplayed or overly clich\u00c3\u00a9d, as his character description would allow for either scenario, but fortunately his dialogue, delivery, and place in the story are so well thought-out that he never has the chance to flounder. Equal parts emotional and hiarious, Dean completes the triangle between Hogarth, the giant, and himself. The last character to finish off the cast is the wonderfully headstrong, slightly crazy and progressively aggressive government agent Kent Mansley (McDonald) whose choices throught the story ultimately lead to the powerful climax. Dislikable in the best way, Mansley represents everything that was bad about the McCarthy/Red Scare era in US history. I keep mentioning the movie's climax, but it's for good reason. At first the conclusion seems contrived, but the brilliance of its execution helps overcome this fact. The last 20 minutes will stick with you for days afterward. Of course, the animation is top-knotch as well. The hand-drawn environments and character movement, as well as voice-to-mouth alignment, make this a visual spectacle that can be referred to as nothing less than art. The sountrack compliments the visuals as well, rounding out the AV experience. In conclusion, I believe that this remains Brad Bird's genre-defining masterwork to date and will remain his best piece unless he somehow outdoes what is essentially perfection. Ratatouille and The Incredibles were fun, but they can't possibly measure up. In fact, I'd say most Pixar films would even find it difficult to compare themselves, mostly because, aside from Up, none deal with adult themes like The Iron Giant. Your biggest competition remains Miyazaki's epic, Spirited Away- and for that, I applaud you, Mr. Bird. You should be honored to be in such impressive company. You've got the Western front covered. Verdict: Movie Win",

ThisBrad Bird's big-screen directorial debut is a simply magical film. It preserves the central themes of the Ted Hughes novel on which it is based, but makes them far more hard-hitting by transporting the story to the USA in the 1950s. This period of extreme paranoia at the height of the Cold War, with the fear of nuclear attack ever on people's minds is the perfect setting for a story about the darker side of human nature and loss of innocence, and allows for a healthy amount of satirical humour and 1950s sci-fi references. The film is a real visual feast, with flawless animation that seamlessly blends hand-drawn characters and environments with CGI elements. The voice cast are superb, with Eli Marienthal emotionally grounding the story as Hogarth Hughes, the lonely, good-natured and endlessly curious young boy who discovers and befriends the titular giant when he crash lands on Earth. Vin Diesel, though voicing a character of few words, imbues the giant with a childlike innocence, and perfectly conveys the sense of sheer horror as he discovers his own origins. Jennifer Aniston probably gives the performance of her career as Hogarth's exasperated single mother Annie and John Mahoney is the perfect casting choice as the patriotic but highly moral General Rogard. The real cast highlights are Harry Connick Jr.'s beatnik scrapyard owner and wannabe artist Dean, who provides most of the comic relief, and Christopher McDonald's federal agent Kent Mansley, who makes an extremely entertaining antagonist. What really makes The Iron Giant work is the balance it manages to maintain between the comic and the serious. There are loads of great gags it's true, but there's also some extremely dark observations about the Cold War state of mind (then there are the scenes that are both funny and serious at the same time, such as the creepily cheerful instructional video telling school children what to do in the event of a nuclear holocaust). You'd have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by the film's finale, with Hogarth and the giant's relationship so well established, and with the addition of Michael Kamen's beautiful, highly emotive score, be prepared to shed the tears. The film feels equidistant between E.T. and King Kong, but is better than either. To dismiss it as simply a film for children would be moronic. The Iron Giant can speak to everyone, no matter your age or background because Brad Bird is a great storyteller and introduces you to characters you can relate to and actually care about, and the moral of his story is universal. The Iron Giant isn't just a brilliant animated film, it's a brilliant film, end of.",

Browsing through films, The Iron Giant caught my eye. I could only hope that I enjoyed this film as much as I did Ratatouille or The Incredibles. The verdict is that the film wasn't was good as either Pixar films, but is more than exceptional entertainment. In fact, this is one of the best non-Pixar animated films I've ever seen. The film opens with a gorgeously animated sequence of a futuristic vehicle flying through space, until it lands in the middle of the ocean where a boat sails nearby. The captain of the boat stares curiously where he saw the flash of light...then a giant 50-foot robot emerges from the ocean. The film only gets better from there. A young boy named Hogarth is at the diner where his Mom works long hours. The boy overhears a conversation about the Iron Giant, and wonders if it truly exists. His question is later answered when he sees the robot near a power plant, and ends up saving the giant's life. The two become friends, though the boy has to hide the giant to avoid the government (and his Mom) from finding out (Think E.T.). The film is quite funny, and it's filled with stunning animation and memorable characters. The story matches up to Pixar quality, in both heart and substance. There are a lot of tricky issues that are discussed in this film; death namely. The Iron Giant is curious about Earth, and one of his experiences is a deer being shot by hunters. The Iron Giant is traumatized by the experience, and Hogarth explains death as well as he can. \"Death isn't a bad thing,\" Hogarth says, \"Everyone dies.\" \"You die?\" The Iron Giant asks. \"Well, yeah, someday.\" Hogarth says. \"...I die?\" The Iron Giant ponders. \"I...don't know. Maybe...\" The film is very thought provoking, and in some of it's many humorous scenes, laugh provoking. It's even a little tear-jerking at times. If you understand or appreciate anything about movies, this film should be viewed as a must-see. Something you have to experience at least once.",

It is such a shame though how the film as a whole was a finical failure, but don\u2019t let that put you off.\r Full Review\rThe main features about the Iron Giant that makes it stand above the crowd are the story and characters. At first it seems a very stereotypical children\u2019s film, with the main character (Hogarth) being the unfortunate, bullied, kid at school who them befriends an iron giant. Furthermore the similarity to E.T is unavoidable, and it could be argued the iron giant is a less emotional version of E.T, as the story for the most part is basically about the relationship between a boy and an unknown creature, while the government try to find the creature. However when the film introduces the villain (Kent) who is sent to investigate certain incidents within the town, the story picks up as Kent becomes more determined to find the giant, and Hogarth must hide him, leading to a game of cat and mouse occurring. Furthermore unlike typical children\u2019s films, where the villain is so obviously evil and a bit dull, here Kent\u2019s position is sort of understandable, as his determination to gain recognition, and his fear of the unknown drive him on, while he is restricted by governmental powers. The combination of believing motivates and restricts on his power, make Kent an excellent villain. Likewise while Hogarth can be boring and stereotypical at first, this changes when he begins his interaction with the Iron Giant, because the relationship between the two is excellently portrayed, as Hogarth tries to restrain the Giant\u2019s power, while at the same time trying to have fun with his own Iron Giant. For me this makes the relationship between the two far more plausible than the relationship between Eliot and E.T, in E.T. Likewise Hogarth nature of being a little bit rebellious while not being a really annoying character, as his maturity further help to place the film higher than its competition.\r The story and characters are made less stereotypical, with the introduction of difficult issues, such as fear of the unknown, teaching something wrong from right in a contemporary setting etc.  However these questions are balanced with elements of heart-warming comedy, whether it is the childish nature of the Giant, the creative imagination of Hogarth etc. help to soften out the moral elements of the film. It certainly makes a nice change from the countless children films that focus only on love/romance.  Such features help to make the Iron Giant a breath of fresh air.\r The excellent story and character portrayal are all enhanced by the excellent voice acting. In particular credit has to go to Christopher McDonald voicing Kent who really provides a nice balance of normality, crazy levels of determination, frustration, and a consistent level of evil. Likewise Vin Diesel voicing the Iron Giant works fantastically well, because his deep voice combined with the lack of spoken dialogue gives the Giant lots of depth.  For me the overall sound of the movie was great as there was a minimalist sound track with hardly any songs, but everything, from the water effects, to the explosions, fit right in to the overall effect and feel of this outstanding movie.\r The only major drawback to the film, decides the things you would expect (dated looks, and plot holes); is the lack of the development of the sub-characters. While lack of development does not affect Dean I particular, the characters that feel under-developed are the General and Hogarth\u2019s mum Annie. Now while the general is not in the film for a long period of time, so his under-development is understandable, the fact that within the film he holds the power of Kent means that by him being barely featured, when he does exercise his power it is not as impactful as it should be. The same sense of under-development affects Annie, who despite being a key character seems a bit unaware of what is going on, and like the General, despite playing a key role as Hogarth\u2019s mum, is not featured enough.\r However, I would still recommend this film to anyone because it is charming and a lot of fun, despite its short comings. A must see.",

The setting, the time period provide a nice backdrop for the story of a metal ET crash landing on earth. We have the Americana version of Maine during the Cold War and a young boy, Hogarth who is basically your everyman as a child. He is precocious and adventerous. He owns a BB gun, he loves his comic books and wants to have a wild animal for a pet. His mother is your typical single mom... or rather a widow (it was not well-established how she lost her husband and I only discovered this after referring to the Wikipedia site) and works at a diner. She is patient, long-suffering with her child's antics and his many other quirks which altogether come out of the stereotypical screenplay bag of basic ideas here. Into Hogarth's life comes this Iron Giant and from there, it plays out like ET. I know this is a kid's movie yet after hearing and reading the great reviews, I found myself wondering how this film could belong to numerous top ten film lists. I kept forcing myself to keep watching, expecting some depth or revelation. Yet Hogarth, his mom, and Dean, an artist who owns a scrapyard were all poorly written characters. The bad guy was boring and idiotic. The climax was overblown and ludicrous. The whole plot offered nothing new. The dialogue felt clumsy and trite.    A pleasant film and I suppose great for children. Weapons are bad. Killing is bad. Yes, wonderful moral messages here along with the idea that we choose to be what we want to be. The film just felt bland and boring, more a chore to watch. There are far better animated films out there. I urge people not to believe the hype. Brad Bird directed this work and it is definitely a first film for him. I recommend The Incredibles which is much more mature and a far better film. It was more well-thought out than this piece of juvenelia. This felt like a sketch that needed more attention to detail. I truly don't understand the rave reviews.

Magnificently animated and voiced, The Iron Giant really progresses nicely, even if its story is a little frenetically paced at times. Additionally, I wish more of the character motivations and backstories had a bit more depth, because as is, it felt very cartoonish with vague motivations and just needlessly evil characters (who are bloodthirsty too?). So, this odd and poor characterization does detract from the film a bit, but the rest is so touching and wonderfully crafted, it is impossible to ignore.

It's a film with animation that still looks breathtaking nearly 20 years later, it's a film that handles mature themes of death and relationships in a way that'll have you think twice about the idea of \"all animated films being kiddy flicks,\" it's a film that's hilarious but also exciting, it's a film with brilliant characters like the charming Hogarth, the witty Dean, and the sinister and complex Mr. Mansley, but most importantly, it's a film that shines through with its title character, the Giant himself, a character that's both badass and adorable, and easy to love. It's a film that has stood the test of time, and it's a film that deserves to be watched not only by fans of animation, but by fans of films in general. It's a true masterpiece of filmmaking, and if there's anything I can criticize, it's that it took me until now to finally watch the film. Don't make the same mistake I did. Watch \"The Iron Giant.\" And if you've seen it already...well, good, but go watch it again! It's truly a breathtaking film.",

There wasn't a single thingThe Iron Giant was a beautiful, funny and touching movie, that is one of the best non-Disney animated movies I have seen along with The Prince of Egypt, The Secret of NIMH, Watership Down and Castle of Cagliostro. There wasn't a single thing I hated about the movie, for me it was outstanding on every level. The animation was absolutely gorgeous, with stunning colourful backgrounds and brilliant character animation especially on the Iron Giant himself. The music by Michael Kamen was consistently excellent, and never overpowered the story. In fact at times it even enhanced the drama. And the film has a beautiful message not to mention a sweet story. The characters were delightful, Hogarth isn't annoying at all and the Iron Giant isn't scary in the slightest. Strictly speaking he has to be one of the most gentle and poignant characters in an animated film. There are plenty of effective scenes like the explosive climax and the scene with the dead deer is a real tear jerker. I will admit I was worried initially when I saw the voice cast, but everybody involved did a superb job. Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jnr were perfect, in their most understated performances. Both get stick about being untalented, but for me their vocal contributions in this film suggests otherwise, while Christopher MacDonald almost steals the film as the FBI agent. Eli Marienthal is very sweet and likable as Hogarth too, and watch out for John Mahoney and Cloris Leachman. All in all, an outstanding film, that if you mind me saying so is the best animated film of 1999 and one of the best films of that year too. I may be wrong but I do think it is highly underrated on IMDb. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Children will love it and adults\"The Iron Giant\" is a fabulous animated feature, funny, touching, vivid and, best of all, humane. I hated it.\rIt's brilliantly animated, and like the masterpieces of its genre it transcends age groupings. Children will love it and adults will be transfixed by its cleverness and its deft satire.\r The movie is set in 1957, in that immediate post-Sputnik panic, when it appeared that we were behind the Russkies and had to catch up. One night in upstate Maine \u2013 this was before the giant alligators of \"Lake Placid\" got there \u2013 a fireball crashes into the sea and the one survivor of a fishing boat sunk by the splash claims that it was a spaceship!\r Later that same week, cute Hogarth, the son of the perky diner waitress, is wandering around, curious about a weird phenomenon: Something has been biting chunks out of tractors. Aliens or commies? Well, the giant footsteps in the mud suggest the presence of a 100-foot-high robot. Hmmmm. Hogarth bumbles into the woods exactly when a 100-foot-high robot is trying to eat the local power station and is about to be electrocuted for his hungers. The boy doesn't run screaming in fear \u2013 as would any kid in a '50s movie \u2013 but instead takes pity on the screaming giant and locates the power station's helpfully placed OFF switch, thereby saving the big guy's life.\r What happens next is sort of like a Lassie movie with a 100-foot-high robot with nuclear weapons in its arms in the role of the collie. Boy and 'bot gambol through the woods, developing a touching relationship. They \"bond.\" Boy is not stupid; he understands that some people might be made anxious by the presence of the 100-foot robot that eats cars for lunch. He helps 'bot hide by taking him to the junkyard \u2013 this would be a Horn & Hardart for a giant metal-eating robot, no? \u2013 which is run by the local beatnik artist. Meanwhile, his perky mom is trying to figure out what to do and a manly FBI agent, just like the one James Arness played in \"Them,\" arrives to investigate.\r Technically, \"The Iron Giant\" is superb. Brilliantly colored, it meshes computer-animated imagery (the robot and most of the war machines) with the more fluent and naturalistic stylings of the old Disney house style. It's \"Bambi\" with robots. The dialogue is sprightly and engaging and the off-screen actors \u2013 particularly Eli Marienthal as Hogarth, the boy, and Jennifer Aniston as his perky mom \u2013 are terrific.\r But at a certain point \"The Iron Giant,\" without missing a beat in charm or artistry, skews off into TULWC. And that would be The Usual Left-Wing Crap. I suppose the movies it is parodying would be considered TURWC, but they were made in the middle of the Cold War. This one was made in the toasty-warm safety of our victory in that war.\r The artistic conceit of \"The Iron Giant\" is to invert the stereotypes of the '50s invasion-from-space movie, with its paranoid, xenophobic overtones and anti-communist metaphoric structure. Think of it as \"The War of the Worlds\" or \"The Thing\" as directed by a member of the Hollywood 10. As I say, TULWC.\r Thus the FBI agent turns out to be a treacherous rat, not a hero; it's the beatnik who gets the girl (Mom) in the end, while the FBI guy runs away like a sniveling craven monster. When the authorities arrive, it's the usual liberal fantasy of the military, an agglomeration of trigger-happy, destruction-crazed yahoos willing to blow away the gentle giant just because he has A-bombs up his size 347 sleeves. Those rats! If they showed him love, this wouldn't have to happen.\r Okay, you're saying: Who wrote this review, \"Strangelove's\" Gen. Buck Turgidson? Still, the movie \u2013 as beautifully drawn, as sleek and engaging as it is \u2013 has the annoyance of incredible smugness. It is, one could say, blinded by the hindsight. How stupid the '50s seem from our enlightened age, yet how utterly easy and cheap it is to affect superiority to that decade, particularly when nowhere in the piece does it acknowledge the existence of an evil empire busily nurturing spies and building H-bombs and threatening to bury us after burying millions of its own. This movie is set in '57, but nobody affiliated with it appears aware of what happened in '56, in Hungary. Yes, I suppose the makers of \"The Iron Giant\" are morally superior to the FBI, CIA, USAF and USN and USA agents, soldiers and officers who fought the Cold War, but it's easy to be superior when your dads have already beaten all your enemies.",

The cadence of this movie is spectacular it flows beautifully and there is no fluff in the entire film. The emotional bonds you set with characters, especially the giant, is amazing and adds so many layers of depth. Every character is crafted so beautifully you feel the emotions that they feel and even the antagonist you can somewhat sympathize towards. The visuals are phenomenal and I never felt like I was watching a movie made 20 years ago ,and what Bird does with the color schemes is spectacular.  The lens in which you watch this movie is through the innocence of a kid, but Bird is not afraid to tackle real issues like the Cold War, death, violence, and even the state of our US Army. The emotions you feel is immense from the joy you feel with Bird's visuals, the anger you feel towards the antagonist, the fear when meeting the giant for the first time, the laughter from the witty dialogue, and finally the sadness when the giant sacrifices himself. This movie does have its fair critiques, but I truly felt a journey when watching this movie; when I finished the film I had chills that I had not felt since watching Forrest Gump. Coming from someone that isn't the biggest fan of animated films, this is personally up there with some of the greats like shawshank or empire as one of the best movies I have ever laid eyes on.",

It does have some appealing, an emotional plot and a good ending, but, for me, it stays at 8/10 because I feel I have seen this type of movie before. A kid that founds \"someone\" that is very unusual or big, no ones believes him. Then people discover that he does exist and are afraid can be harmful, so they decide to eliminate him. Then at the end, that creature confirms he is good and it's a happy ending. So it was very predictable for me, but it doesn't mean it was bad. Another thing is that it let me with some questions like, where does the robot come from? How does he understand so well English, or even speak? But I think that the movie let that to the audience to think.I recommend this movie to a family with kids, you will enjoy it for sure!",
