            "content": "This is a fine drama and a nice change of pace from today's more hectic and loud films. It is another solid based-on-a-true store, which still means much of it could be made up for dramatic purposes. Frankly, I don't know but I liked the story.The story is about a young man back in the Fifties who gets interested in rocketry and wants to enter that field instead of working in the coal mines as everyone else, including his father, does in this West Virginia town. The big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father, which I think was overdone. I would like to have a little less tension between the two.The young man, still a boy, is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, one of his first staring assignments, I think. He's likable, as are his school buddies in here. It's nice to see nice kids in a modern-day film. The two other key actors in the movie are Chris Cooper (the dad) and Laura Dern (the kid's teacher who encourages him all the time.)The cinematography is decent the 1950s soundtrack is fun to hear. Once again: I wish there more of these kind of films made today.",

            "content": "I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005) a little while back and, since then, I've been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has an intensity (and he even resembles Owen somewhat) that just oozes from the screen. I feel sure that, if he lands some meaty roles, he'll crack an Oscar one day...That's not to denigrate this film at all.It's a fine story, with very believable people (well, it's based upon the author's early shenanigans with rocketry), a great cast \u0096 Chris Cooper is always good, and Laura Dern is always on my watch list \u0096 with the appropriate mix of humor, pathos, excitement...and the great sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to get the feet tapping.But, this film had a very special significance for me: in 1957, I was the same age as Homer Hickham; like him, I looked up at the night stars to watch Sputnik as it scudded across the blackness; like Homer also, I experimented with rocketry in my backyard and used even the exact same chemicals for fuel; and like Homer, I also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster! What fun it was...I didn't achieve his great (metaphorical and physical) heights though. But, that's what you find out when you see this movie.Sure, it's a basic family movie, but that's a dying breed these days, it seems. Take the time to see it, with the kids: you'll all have a lot of good laughs.",

            "review_title": "A film that hits close to home....",
            "content": "\"October Sky\" is a film that will steal your heart, fill your mind with vivid imagery, and lift your spirit. The tale of Homer Hickham and his dream of creating a rocket seem so simple at first, especially when the film is set in a mining town, where the future is as clear cut as the lumps of coal in the mine. But Homer cannot follow in his father's footsteps. With the encouragement of Miss Riley,(a friendly teacher), members of his father's staff, and his friends, Homer attempts to make his dream a reality.Yet as in any true to life story, there are many stops along the way. Director Joe Johnston lowers us into the coal mines, where we witness the chilling plight of miners stooped beneath a ceiling of rock. With lit helmets and bent posture, they resembled alien insectoids more than humans in the darkness. The hacking coughs of the miners and the blackened faces were a constant reminder of the danger the miners faced in their work.Contrasting the mine shaft's lugubrious load are the images of Homer and his friend's rocket launches. Underneath the blue bowl of sky, rockets are placed upon a pad and launched into the stratosphere...And nothing can match the scene when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time.Yet what makes the film so endearing is the relationship between the characters. Homer's father is a classic hardened man...but he has a soft side as well. We see that he does love his son, despite their many arguments. The love and support of Miss Riley is evident as well. Best of all, the film is uncomfortable. It doesn't tie everything up in a nice bow. It tears at you, lifts you up. It keeps an air of reality, which is important in a film like this.This film can be considered a complete work. At first, I was disappointed that the film did not continue with Homer's life. I didn't want it to end. Then I realized...that's what a good film does to a person. If it has done its job, you won't want it to end. And \"October Sky\" accomplishes just that.",

            "content": "I have yet to read \"The Rocket Boys\", the book upon which this film is based, but this situation will not continue! I did read a short story by Hickam which was apparently the seed that started him on the novel. It grabbed me even then.I am one of those fortunate enough to have lived adjacent to Cape Canaveral during the Mercury program, where my father worked, and this childhood situation no doubt fostered my lifelong interests and hobbies. I also met Werner von Braun, and one of the other German rocket scientists repaired a rubber band driven model plane I had (I WISH I still had that plane!) I mention this because I went into the movie with serious expectations and very much desired to see a film with authentic treatments for the nostalgia and emotions of the period.I was not disappointed. While there were superficial flaws here and there, the movie came together like so few Hollywood films do. Good storytelling, authentic emotions and period atmosphere. As others have experienced at this excellent film, I was choked up at the end and had to wipe away the tears. The father of the family next to me asked to borrow my spare paper napkin to wipe his tears. About half the audience applauded at the end, and most everyone stayed through the credits. It's just one of those films.Not the greatest movie ever made, but one of the best family movies in a long time.",

            "content": "It was 1957 and Russia had just launched Sputnik. I was almost 12, and I remember my father pointing up into the October sky as we tried to catch a glimpse of the Earth's first artificial satellite orbiting overhead. Thus the title \"October Sky\". In West Virginia the son of a coal miner became intrigued with rockets and space travel and, in spite of his father's urgings that he accept his fate and become a coal miner too, eventually won the national science fair competition, and a college scholarship, ultimately became a key member of the space exploration team of NASA. A wonderful and inspiring story, and a superb film of that story.Everyone was good in the film, but Chris Cooper as the miner boss and stubborn father was far and away the best in \"October Sky.\"  Although \"rockets\" is the theme, the film is primarily of the struggle of children trying to break out of the cycle and become more than just another coal miner. As an epilog we learn that all four of the \"rocket boys\" went to college, the father died of mining-related disease, the teacher of Hodgkins disease, and the whole town and mining operation was sold and shut down in the next decade.",

            "review_title": "It was hard to choose your future in the 1950s for a worker's son.",
            "content": "A simple and effective film about what life is all about, responding to challenges. It took a lot of gall for Homer and his friends to be able to grow into manhood without falling in the trap of a prefabricated future that runs from father to son, to be a miner in the local mine and never get out of that fate. It took also three different challenges for Homer and his friends to conquer a personal and free future. The challenge of the first ever man-made artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, a Soviet satellite, a milestone in human history, a turning point that Homer and his friends could not miss, did not want to miss. Then the challenge of science and applied mechanics to calculate and to devise a rocket from scratch or rather from what they could gather in books and order in their minds. Finally the challenge of a world that resists and refuses and tries to force you back into the pack, even with an untimely accident that forces you to get back into the pack for plain survival necessity, and even then Homer proved he had the guts to accept the challenge that was blocking for a while his own plans and dreams. But there is another side of the story that the film does not emphasize enough. Homer is the carrier of the project but he is also the carrier of the inspiration he and his friends need. If he is the one who is going to get the university scholarship, because his friends gave him precedence, his friends will also be able to get on their own roads and tracks and step out of the mining fate, thanks to the energy his inspiring example sets in front of their eyes. It is hard at times not to follow the example of the one who is like a beacon on a difficult road. But the film is also effective to show how the father resisted this dream because for him science was not the fabric of a true man, like mining or football. The working class fate that was so present in those 1950s and 1960s and still is present in some areas is too often enforced by the traditional thinking of the father. If the mother does not have the courage to speak up one day, the working class fate I am speaking of becomes a tremendous trap. Here too the film is effective and it should make some parents think. This might have been the fourth challenge Homer had to face: the challenge of taking a road that was not the one pointed at and programmed by his own father.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",

            "content": "I resisted seeing this movie and I understand why it was not a big hit in theatres.  \"October Sky\" feels and looks oh so familiar.  And it is.  All plot contrivances and emotions have been explored before in other films -- and possibly even better.  But despite it's familiarity and resistance to all formulas Hollywood, this movie is winning and likeable at every turn. \nSputnik is the inspiration for this journey of the heart, mind and soul. Just as the characters from Steven Sondheim's musical MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG stood agape atop their apartment roof hoping it would launch their new generation (\"What do you call it?  You call it a miracle.\"), Sputnik has a similar affect on the young rocket boys of this true tale.  While jaded townsfolk of their 1950's coal town dismiss the event, Homer Hickham sees Sputnik as his ticket out of a life in the mines.Masterful direction and casting make the journey of rocket boy Homer and his pals seem fresh and new.  Especially affecting are subplots concerning Homer's ailing young school teacher.  Remarkable restraint is shown in depicting their delicate relationship.  Also remarkable is the father / son supblot that anchors the film.  Perfectly played all around.  Even Homer's mom gets her moment without cliche or intrusion.  Her ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and heatbreaking.  \"Myrtle Beach\" says it all. \nA major video chain I despise has a sign next to this film stating that you'll love this film or they'll refund your money.  For once, I agree with them.  You'll never look at the October sky quite the same again.",

As his motivating science teacher, Laura Linney is quite good but her southern accent is over the top.There is a standout supporting performance by Chris Cooper, a head miner, who wants his son to follow in his footsteps, but gradually comes around at film's end.What makes this film so unusual for our times is that there are no bed-hopping scenes and no profanity whatsoever. It is the epitome of an American story that is well done.Besides the science angle, we have the father-son disagreement, football scholarships as a way to escape coal mining, and the loving spirit of family.Why aren't pictures like this recognized more at award times?",

            "content": "There is an old saying that relates to the rousing new film by Joe Johnston that goes something like this: \"The man who thinks he can and the man who thinks he can't are both right.\"  That is a highly presumptuous statement referring to self motivating and belief in an individual, which, in this movie, stand true even after road blocks and family trouble stand in the way.\"October Sky\" is about a young man who believes in himself named Homer Hickam, growing up in a strict, traditional family in the 1950's. Homer loves in a small coal mining town where nearly every man grows up to be a miner. All of his friends, Quentin, Roy, and O'Dell all think that their life after high school will be like everyone else's. Homer is not exited about that future.One night, while everyone stares at the sky, a Russian space craft called Sputnik passes overhead. This is something new for Homer, and he finds it spectacular and overwhelming. From this point on, his look at life will never be the same.First, he tells everyone that he wants to work in the rocket scientist area for an occupation.  Flabbergasted at what he says, his family passes that idea over their heads and continues with life as usual His friends, however, think that this idea may have some potential. After all, Quentin is a very smart individual when it comes to this kind of thing.When the four friends start to test model rockets, and blow a white picket fence to smithereens, then what seems to be a forest fire is scared by them, they're forced to end their progresses.The performances in this movie are absolutely riveting from start to finish. All of the actors give performances as if this is the real mumbo jumbo here. Standing out in all of the glory: Laura Dern as Miss Riley. This very well may be Academy award material if the judges can remember back to the beginning of the year when this film is released.The characters are also extremely well developed. Not only to the filmmakers give clear, apparent reason why Homer is interested in the subject, but they also explain to the audience how they are succeeding in their studding of rocketry. We clearly understand all of the characters' motives and beliefs, especially the father, who is bent over on everlasting tradition.The film, unfortunately, loses some of its momentum at mid-point because of a silly, recycled romantic sub-plot involving Homer's love interest and how his brother stole her from him. This type of this is becoming so awfully common in high-school movies, not that this film is aimed at high-schoolers. The actors stare at each other mindlessly, like the are in a trance.  I put up with it without complaining in 1997's \"Inventing the Abbots,\" but I have had just about enough this.But that is just a minor complaint. With an authentic looking time period, cinematography worth an Oscar and clips of the real life Homer and friends at the end, whom all hit it big with their dreams, especially Homer, this is the first great film of 1999.",

The film has some powerful themes that are beautifully scripted. The acting is superb all around (Chris Cooper has never turned in a bad acting role in my opinion!) The message of this film is so well delivered, so powerful, that it moved me to tears the first time I saw it. Not sad tears, which are easily solicited by cinema formula, but tears of joy--a rare thing.Although I did not grow up in the 1950's, I believe this film honestly portrays the mood and setting of the time.

            "content": "When I first saw the premise, I thought the movie would be similar to VARSITY BLUES (without the sports, of course)...somewhat cheesy and predictable. However as the story develops, one will notice that Joe Johnston actually had a well-thought out plan for this feature. The story is moving and compelling, and will affect you emotionally in ways movies like these rarely do.The reason? It's a simple movie, with a relatively familiar backdrop, but it's done very straightforwardly with no hint of pretension. At times there is some degree of predictability, but then the story takes rather unexpected turns. Just when you think you know exactly what will happen, the movie will prove your alleged clairvoyance wrong.The standout in this movie for me is the interaction between Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. This interaction provides one of the more complex and layered father/son relationships you will see in a movie of this nature. Laura Dern also has a small role but manages it quite effectively.Moreover, much has been done to recreate the 1950s ambiance; from the costumes to the art decoration to the architecture, this movie looks and feels like it is based in the 1950s, adding to the overall viewing experience.I would recommend this for anyone looking to see a (much) better-than-average film about belief in oneself and achieving one's dreams in the face of adversity, although this movie is much more than just that. Not for those who think cheesy special effects and mind-numbingly lewd comedy are prerequisites for a good film.3.5 stars (out of 4). 8/10. Should warrant a place in my Honourable Mentions list.",

            "content": "A high school boy's fascination with the Russian Sputnik missile fostered a life long love of rocketry and outer space travel. \"October Sky\" tells that story of Homer Hickam and his boyhood friends who achieved a level of notoriety in the small town of Coalwood, West Virginia in the late 1950's. The film is inspiring in it's message of believing in yourself and following one's dreams, even in the face of widespread ridicule and family opposition. Homer (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his friends Roy Lee (William Lee Scott), O'Dell (Chad Lindberg) and Quentin (Chris Owen) join forces to develop their own personal answer to the country's space program by repeatedly trying and failing to build a successful rocket, until their perseverance is finally rewarded with a successful launch that amazes even them.A palpable sense of family tension is present throughout however, as Homer's dad expects his son to follow in his footsteps as a home town coal miner. He treats Homer differently from older brother Jim (Scott Thomas), who's athletic ability stands to earn him a college football scholarship, one of the few ways out for a graduating teen growing up in a town with no prospects of it's own. John Hickam (Chris Cooper) doesn't come around to Homer's way of thinking until the very end of the story when the young man's accomplishments earn recognition for himself, his 'Rocket Boys' team, and his high school. And as often is the case, there's a stellar teacher on hand to support the pursuit of knowledge for it's own sake. For Homer, it's Miss Riley (Laura Linney), stricken at an early age with Hodgkins lymphoma, but undeniably a supporter who's belief in Homer puts her in direct conflict with the school principal and it's Board of Ed.I thought it quite interesting that a marquee at a local movie house in the picture was featuring \"The Incredible Shrinking Man\", a B grade sci-fi flick of the era. I think if you watch that film, you'll find it to be a whole lot better than it would have any right to be based on it's title. In a way, it's diametrically opposite to Homer's goal of reaching for the stars, as it's main character is faced with a dilemma of growing smaller and smaller on a daily basis. At first horrified by that prospect he eventually comes to terms with his plight and endeavors to adapt to a life that brings him new challenges on a daily basis. Any sense of closure for the viewer is left to one's own imagination, a rather daring concept for a film of any genre to propose back in the Fifties. Reading some of the other reviews for the film on this site, it's not surprising to see how many others got misty eyed over the relationship between Homer and his father. The father/son dynamic is one that affects me in similar ways in movies like this, as one looks back over one's life, it's comforting to reflect on those good times that overcame any difficulties. Coming from humble beginnings, I'm sure young men like Homer and his buddies never forgot their roots and where they came from, knowing that their experience might some day inspire others to reach for the stars themselves.One last thought - the title 'October Sky' is a perfect anagram of 'Rocket Boys' - how cool is that?",

This one, however, was nothing less then good.October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam, a boy inspired by the Sputnick launch to become a rocket scientist. He and his friends begin to build rockets. His father is not to happy about his sons new found hobby and would rather see him become a coal-miner as himself or go to college on a football-scholarship like his brother.The story is well written. A bit too predictable maybe, but that's OK cause it doesn't focus too much on those parts of the story. It's important part, but where this is obvious the inner action, the action between the characters is focused on. The story is good. It has some clich\u00e9s, but that's OK. It's based on actual event's so you kind of can't just drop out these clich\u00e9s. The characters are really good. Where the story is on a downhill the characters are brought out and manage to keep the action and the quality of the movie high. You get to know these characters and you get sympathy for them. They are well written and believable.This is a good looking movie. The sets and the 50's style is thorough and the pictures are well composed and well lit. This all sets the mood of the film very good.The acting is really good. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a great performance as Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper is good as John Hickam. As for the rest of the cast they are good too. All together this makes out a pretty strong cast.All in all I'm glad I caught this movie. It was first after seeing it I learned that it was based on actual events. If I had known that when seeing it, it would probably just be even more interesting. October Sky is a good and interesting movie. It's a movie I believe everyone can enjoy. It's kind of a feel-good movie. Not bad at all!",

            "content": "There is a bit of trivia which should be pointed out about a scene early in the movie where Homer watches the attempt of December 6, 1957 (at least that was the video used on the TV he was watching) which showed the Vangard launch attempt, which failed.He is next shown reading or dictating a letter to Dr. Von Braun offering condolences about the failure.Von Braun was at Marshall space flight center in Huntsville working for the Army. The Vanguard project was by the early Nasa team which was at what soon became Goddard Space flight center.The army rushed the Jupiter-C, which was essentially a US made V2 technology, but worked to launch a satellite in response to Russia's success with Sputnik.This error may have actually been made by Homer, because of the notoriety of Von Braun, but his team didn't have their attempt fail. In fact the underlying Redstone was flying from 52 and was the first US man rated booster, used for Shepard's sub orbital flight, as well as Grissom's.This is why this sort of movie is so good, as it hopefully will inspire people to read up and spot these bits of trivia, and in the process see what has been done, and be inspired to do more.",

The Rocket Boys went on to make great lives for themselves. I went on to get my degrees in Physics and Computer Engineering.

My own tornado landed me in my own State's Science Fair, in Physics by '62, though our group was less successful in gaining the support of, for example, firefighters we approached for guidance and counsel until after a tragic event, our city went so far as to allow us to tour the Nike missile site on Chicago's lakeshore.This movie brought it all back for me and I will bet that it brought it all back for a bunch of us \"UberNerds\" of the late '50s and early 60's.We are in a similar science brain drainage period now and really need this movie as a country.

This is the true story of four boys in a coal mining town that, instead of growing up to become coal miners like their fathers, they want to do something more. They want to make something of themselves. Inspired by the launch of the first Sputnik, the four boys set out to create their own rocket and win the county science fair to win themselves scholarships. OCTOBER SKY wins on every level. Humor, drama, a little action, some romance (not very much). I really enjoy movies of this caliber. While it wasn't a very big hit in theaters, it was still one of the best movies that I have ever seen so far in my life. I saw this movie in science class, because we are learning about the creation of rockets ourselves, but I didn't really pay much attention to the building of the rocket, it was more the feel and sadness of the film. It is truely a great movie to watch with or without your family. It is good either way. After I am done writing this, I am going to watch it again. I just thought it best to write my review before I see it in friggen wide-screen format on my DVD. I seriously cannot see how people can enjoy watching movies on wide-screen. It takes away half of the screen! What the hell is up with that? And people say its better? Some people are just really stupid. But, here's hoping that the great feel of the movie will keep me happy and keep me from not moaning about it. If you like this movie, I also recommend THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, THE GREEN MILE, STAND BY ME, THE MAJESTIC, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE,and HEARTS IN ATLANTIS. 5/5 for all of those including OCTOBER SKY.",

Hickam, Jr. - it is everything young people should see to remind them that dreams are indeed possible. The story takes place in the little mining town of Coalwood, West Virginia in 1957 when all eyes were focused on the seemingly unreal launching of Russia's Sputnik. Homer, Jr. (Jake Gyllenhaal, with all of his innate charm intact even then!) longs to get away from his presumed destiny of working in the coal mines upon graduation from high school. But Homer's ideals are higher and with the aid of his friends he designs and launches a little rocket that at first angers his miner father (Chris Cooper) but excites his teacher (Laura Dern), who assists Homer in his dreams of rising above the frustrating level of his life in the little town to accomplish dreams he never thought possible. There is just the right amount of tender humor, status resistance, and recreation of a period of time in our history when suddenly everything was possible if a rocket could place a satellite in orbit and transmit signals to the earth. For those of us who lived it this film is an enriching memory, and for those who didn't witness it, the film offers a true sense of the possibilities of the open human spirit. It is a delightful little film. Grady Harp",

            "content": "My son, now a college science freshman, has been fascinated with space exploration for over a decade now and always dreamed of watching a blast off from Cape Kennedy. He now views NASA's space program a little more realistically and perhaps not quite as positively, but this film was a true inspiration to him and a great hit with our entire family.It tells the true story of a West Virginia coal miner's son, Homer Hickam, who dreams of rocketry after seeing the USSR's Sputnik lighting up the October sky...very dramatic scene here, truly conveying his awe and wonder at the spectacle. To the consternation of his mining dad (who disapproves) but encouragement of his science teacher, Miss Riley, Homer puts his dreams into practice as he, the school nerd, and a couple of pals experience a series of failures and successes (mainly failures) in their trial and error rocket building attempts. Will Homer succeed in time for the county science fair and win the much needed scholarship awarded as prize?I won't give the ending away, but this film is a tribute to dreaming big dreams, pursuing those dreams despite obstacles and opposition, and especially persevering. It should serve as both an inspiration to all young people, whatever form their dreams may take, as well as a tribute to man's ongoing curiosity about our galaxy and methods for space exploration.The characters are well drawn, especially the interactions between Homer and his father, who finds himself in conflict with the son he loves, having planned for him a traditional coal mining career. In light of the recent West Virginia mining disasters, the dangers inherent in that particular career choice have been sadly brought to the forefront of public attention in a way much less meaningful to me when I first viewed this movie.As for the love interest to which other reviewers have made reference, it must indeed be a sub-plot as I have absolutely no recollection of it now. Obviously not crucial to the main drama, though the whole movie had a real and rather refreshing nostalgic, old fashioned 50's feel to it. It made me wish I was raising my child back in that era.Wonderful heart warming and uplifting tale that will surely put a lump in your throat and encourage you in your own way to reach for the stars.",

            "content": "This is a movie that really nails a time in place in the American story. Coal was still king and the Cold War was in full swing. The American experience was diverse and things were moving ahead at a faster clip. No place was more unique than West Virginia. It was a place built on the blood, guts, and that black magic energy source. In a town named Coalwood we find a boy mesmerized by the Soviet satellite Sputnik. As the future of coal, due to the town's mine starting to give out, was anything but certain Homer Hickman, our young rocketeer, decided his future wasn't coal. It was rockets. This young boy was a classic dreamer whose blue-collar father thought was wasting time with this silly rocket idea.October Sky delivers oodles of Americana in a time of great change in the evolution of our country from industrial to technology. No one could imagine that technology would trump old industrial might and for a youngster dreaming of rockets it was an uphill climb. In Coalwood especially because this town's glory was rooted in a past history of producing coal and nothing else. Coal was Coalwood so the name is natural. There is a struggle not only in the town to keep up finding new coal reserves, but with the changing times forcing change. In this climate the young dreamer Homer was snake bit with his dream of rocketry. He wouldn't give in to any of the roadblocks and his own dad's insolence. In fact he began the arduous task of changing minds of which his dad's was the most pivotal.This movie really nails a historic time. It is a great human interest story that happens to be Homer Hickman's true story. This story is compelling and the movie gets the period, the town, and the nation's quick push into science and space down pat. Jake Gylenhaal delivers a fine performance projecting a fine career ahead of the young actor here. The bottom line is Homer Hickman represents a nations new paradigm and against all odds he achieves his dream. See this film because it's equally going to pull your heartstrings, stir prideful nostalgia, and tell the story of nation all in the guise of young boy. Excellent! I also recommend you read Homer Hickman's book Rocket Boys AKA October Sky.",

            "content": "October Sky is one of the most average films in recent memory.  It moves from cliche to cliche without a care in the world because the film itself is a cliche: if you work hard enough, you will be rewarded.  You get all the elements that work against our unlikely hero, such as a tough father and skeptical friends, as well as some unexpected advantages, like a helpful teacher and a resident genius friend.  The movie stumbles through these situations and banks that the audience will buy it because it is based on a true story.  And it seems like it has worked because most viewers seem to like the film.There were some fine elements in the film. Chris Cooper is Hollywood's most underrated actor.  His performance as the father could have been very flat, but instead he allows him to be a three dimensional man.  The development of the relationship between the father and son is nice, if not a little Freudian.  The other performances are nice too, but nothing special.  Laura Dern, another underrated performer, is given a terrible, underwritten role, but she does the best she can.  Also, the film does end much better than it begins.  The first 75 minutes have a lot of silly setpieces, like \"let's play on the train tracks like in Stand By Me\" and \"let's find our lost rocket even if the relevance to the plot is no longer clear\".  The end of the film really comes together, though, by focusing on the father-son relationship and the futures of the boys once they get out of that dreadful town.One final note is in order.  I believe that the film was completely unfair to unions and intentionally tried to make them look evil.  Why is everyone associated with the union leadership portrayed like a wild, snarling animal? Could it be that the entire film is a quiet piece of right-wing propaganda? Does anybody really believe that if we just follow our dreams that everyone has an equal chance in America?  These are just a few final thoughts, and they ultimately do not impact on my overall appraisal of the film, which I give a 6.",

            "content": "There's not much original in this story of a high school kid who yearns to send rockets into the sky rather than work in the local coal mine. It's all pretty formulaic. But formulas are in such common use because they are dependable. Who would argue with A squared plus B squared equals C squared? They get the job done.Jake Gyllenhaal is the obsessed kid. He looks ordinary and is fascinated by an arcane subject like rocket design in a way that only a teen ager can be. He lives in a small West Virginia town where everything revolves around the coal mine which, like the town itself, is moribund. He has his mother's love, of course, but his dad (Chris Cooper) grew up in the mines and is now a kind of manager, and Gyllenhaal's aspirations occasion some irritation in his father. Cooper wants him to come down in the mines like everybody else instead of fooling around with this nonsense and worshiping Werner von Braun. Cooper makes a particular point of never attending any of Gyllenhaal's experimental launches. Gyllenhaal's teacher (Laura Dern) recognizes that the kid is a wizard and supports him.At first the others in town treat him and his interest in rocketry as half loony. One by one, though, the kid draws others into his sphere. A pimply nerd and a handful of other alienated students join him in building rockets that at first explode if anyone looks cross-eyed at them. Eventually others, including a black machinist at the mine, help him build rockets that act, not like inverted pendulums, but like rockets. There are, naturally, some obstacles along the way. His father's constant belittling of him, for one thing. And then there's the matter of finding money for materials, which leads to one or two comic incidents. Then his father is injured in a mine accident for which the company won't pay, so Gyllenhaal must drop out of school and go down and work in the mines for a while, accompanied by plangent violins. But in the end, he is sent to the Science Fair in Indianapolis, where he displays his rockets and their components. The score swells into an orgasmic triumph. (It's the International Geophysical Year of 1958.) Does Gyllenhaal win first prize? No power on earth could force an answer from me. Gyllenhaal returns to Coal Community, WVA, where he sets off one last big celebratory rocket. The entire town of Coaldorf has attended, everyone bursting with pride. Gyllenhaal dedicates this rocket to everyone who has helped him in his travails, listing them one by one, before finally reaching \"my father\" -- and, lo, there is Dad edging his way to the front of the crowd! Final shot: the space shuttle being launched from Cape Canaveral. It's got every clich\u00e9 in the book but it's kind of sweet too. None of the performances stands out, although Chris Cooper does a good job with the role of the all-but-fossilized, but gentle, father. He's a pretty good actor.Of all the films about adolescents finding their own voice, this one is about average, but it's suitable for family viewing. The kids will understand it as well as the adults, and although their minds may not be exalted, neither will they be turned into suppurating boils. The location shooting is good, too, leading us to understand why Gyllenhaal would like to leave Coalton-sur-mont behind him.",

            "content": "October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal). He is a high school boy from a coal mining town in West Virginia. Unless you were able to get a football scholarship the chances of getting out of Coalwood were small. Homer does not fit the bill of a football player and refuses to become another miner. Instead he sets his sights on what's above the earth rather than below it. In the wake of the first Sputnik launch Homer decides to take up rocketry without the approval of his coal miner father John (Chris Cooper).This film is a small slice of life depicting the perseverance of Homer and his friends to make something of their lives. They receive little support from the majority of the town members who believe that there's not much else to life besides mining coal and playing football. October Sky takes the dreams of four high school boys and inspires those who believe that you can become something bigger than the life society deems for you.The screenplay is well written, the acting top notch, and the story is bigger than the setting. This small period piece is amazingly uplifting and can touch a wide audience. It is a family movie and is one that all can enjoy regardless of age.I first saw this film in theaters when I was eight. Over fifteen years later I still find this movie as inspirational as the first time I saw it. I keep it on my shelf under movies that will lift me up. It is simple but extraordinary at the same time. This little gem should be on everyones list to watch. I think it is a movie that will never be outdated and one that will stay with all those that have seen it.",

Having driven through Coalwood WV where they grew up, one quickly can see how the odds are favorable for working in the coal mines. Being raised in a similar situation where the principle income was coal and refractories while graduating from high school in the 98th percentile in the nation in science, I can identify with these boys challenges, desires, and purpose driven objectives. Many a child in similar situations simply take what is laid before them and turn from the challenge to break the mold and move out into a bigger and more broadened world. Homer struggles with this challenge and even finds family obstacles and academic hurdles to overcome should he and his friends decide to break on through to the other side.Will Homer and his friends make it? Should they try to make something better of their lives? The director, cast, and crew work hard at making you part of that decision process. Expect to find points where you want to scream \"do it\" but also expect to be saddened when the chips fall and the challenge grows to greater summits then the boys have courage. Will they succeed? Will they meet the challenge and rise above it? Or, will they join the rank and file and become just as their fathers and their fathers for generations? You have to see this one and have your children see it too. I give it a 10 for content, life impact, and personal growth . . and . . the directing, acting, and setting aren't bad either. Actually the latter set the pace for an exciting and enjoyable flick that will leave your heart filled with desire. DrD",

            "content": "I think that we can now say that Jake Gyllenhaal's troika of great roles are \"October Sky\", \"Donnie Darko\" and \"Brokeback Mountain\" (\"The Day After Tomorrow\" was also worth seeing). In the first one, he plays 1950s West Virginia teenager Homer Hickam. In their small town, the men work in the coal mine and it's assumed that all the boys will go into that line of work - or become jocks.Then, in October, 1957, the Soviet satellite Sputnik glides across the sky. Homer realizes that he wants to go into that line of work, so he and his friends start making test rockets. Needless to say, Homer's family is shocked at this, and the local jocks don't like it either. But Homer knows his desire, and he and his friends keep at it.If Jake Gyllenhaal was relatively unknown when this movie came out, then it surely cemented him as a talented presence on the silver screen. Equally great in the movie are Chris Cooper as Homer's coal miner father, who is nervous about his son doing this, and Laura Dern as Homer's teacher, who encourages him. All in all, very well done.",

The music now fits the mood of the film perfectly.I did not only enjoy the music, I also quite enjoyed the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a surprise for me.

In a small town in West Virginia a 17-year-old boy, Homer Hickam, is fascinated by this development and is determined to build and launch his own rocket. He enlists the help of three friends in his endeavour. However, coal mining is all that people know in those parts and they will face stiff opposition, most of all from Homer's own father, the manager of the local mine.Interesting story, based on Homer Hickam's book \"Rocket Boys\". Seems conventional but the plot has enough twists and turns to prevent it from being unoriginal and predictable. Very entertaining at times, as we see the boys' adventures, struggles, failures and successes in building and launching the rocket.There's also a great human element to the drama: Homer's relationship with his father, the teacher's interest in the project succeeding, the constant danger that awaits those that take the town's usual profession - coal mining. This adds a sentimental and emotional element to the movie that ultimately results in some great heart-warming moments.Jake Gyllenhaal, in his first starring role, is great as Homer Hickam. While this movie didn't truly launch his career, his next would: Donnie Darko. Good work by Chris Cooper as his father and Laura Dern as Miss Riley, his teacher. Solid supporting cast.",

All too often, true stories are transformed into fiction in order to 'tell a good story'....though these are REAL people and they deserve a true accounting of their exploits. And, when I began watching \"October Sky\", although I enjoyed it, I also was saddened that once again the truth was, at times, completely expendable. The real story is differeent in too many ways for me to mention here--just suffice to say that instead of 4 brilliant budding rocket scientists, there were 6 and IMDB mentions several more ways in which this movie diverges from the truth.The story begins with Sputnik. Not surprisingly, the Soviets making it into space first caused an uproar here in the States....and this film is about how it inspired a group of West Virginia high school students to become junior rocket scientists. On their own, the group built some amazing rockets for teens though the film talks a LOT about how the main character's father and principal fought so hard to keep him from following this dream....and again, I really wonder if this was true or was 'artistic license' (a nice way of saying they lied).Despite my complaint about the voractity of everything in this movie, I DID still enjoy it quite a bit and found it quite inspirational...and much of it is because although there were changes to the story, the fundamental kernel of a story was great! By the time it's over, you'll likely be misty-eyed and excited...which are great testaments to the acting and direction in this movie.",

My favorite part of the movie is how the relationship between father and son was depicted. In most movies like this, the father is often depicted as the tyrant. But, while he is strict here, he is not as bad as most of these fathers. The film is boasted by lovable, relatable characters, a very strong screenplay, and great direction.Joe Johnston's film is about how four guys including Homer Hickam in a coal-mining town decide to create a rocket against the will of everyone in town besides their encouraging teacher.The acting is very good. Young Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Homer and he is a very good actor, much better than other child actors. Chris Cooper was really good as his father and I didn't hate him as much as I thought I would. Laura Dern is pretty good as the teacher, but I believe she over-acted just a little.Overall, this is a fantastic film for all ages to see. I'm sure this film could hit notes with the older generation who grew up in the 1950's. The movie inspires everybody that they can be who they want to be, and they must not let anyone get in their way. I rate this film 10/10.",

With the success of Elton John's musical version of \"Billy Elliott,\" how long can it be before \"October Sky\" hits Broadway.Like Billy's tale, the story of Homer Hickam is based in fact. Captivated by the launching of the Russian satellite, Sputnik, Homer wants to launch his own rocket, and Werner von Braun becomes his hero. Teaming with three schoolmates and encouraged by his teacher, Homer learns all he can about rocketry to achieve his goal. Well written with conviction and heart, \"October Sky\" has a fine cast that seems to have realized the special nature of the project. A young Jake Gyllenhaal is fine as Homer, a role that obviously gave a boost to his career. Laura Dern is excellent as Miss Riley, the cheer-leading teacher. However, Chris Cooper is the standout as John Hickam, a man who has spent his life in the mines, risen to a leadership role, and does not comprehend that his son wants more than that. Cooper is a master of repressed feeling. For some unknown reason, Cooper was overlooked at awards time for this and his later roles in \"American Beauty\" and \"Breach,\" which makes his Oscar for \"Adaptation\" all the more deserving.Although filmed in Tennessee, Fred Murphy's cinematography captures the gray bleakness of a West Virginia mining town. The use of popular songs from the 1950's and early 1960's adds a nice period feeling, and Mark Isham's haunting original score aches with nostalgia. However, Gyllenhaal and Cooper are at the core of the film, and their scenes together capture a strained father-son relationship that evolves over the course of the film into one of mutual respect. Again, this parallels the dynamics of Billy and his father. Elton John, are you listening?",

            "content": "This is a great film, based on a true story and inspired by a best-selling, award winning book called \"Rocket Boys\". The book and the film tell the true-life saga about one high school student, who beats the odds and eventually gets a scholarship that sends him on his path to a career at NASA. It is the mid-1950s and America is facing its fears of the Soviets getting into space before them. Two worlds of thought begin to emerge when major changes happen in world history. This was a big one. Imagine living in the quiet 1950s. The baby-boomer generation was in full swing and people were happy. Technoloy and innovation was on a huge rise. The computer was a new thing and the most infiltrating thing in your house was a rickety old TV (roughly 55 million households had TVs in 1958). On the dark side, World War II opened the floodgates to missile and rocket technology. We just ended the Korean War, but began the Cold War. Imagine you living in your home with your simple life around you and one of the super powers (and not the one that represents your team), gets into orbit first. So, that pushed the paranoia of the day and naturally people worried about their Eden coming to an end.Homer Hickam JR., played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is a simple kid growing up in a coal mining town in rural West Virginia. Homer, a senior in high school, has an older brother, who Homer has to deal with when it comes to impressing their father. It is always tough for a kid, trying to do well on his own, when he is over-shadowed by an older sibling, with a football scholarship already waiting for him. His father, played magnificently by Chris Cooper, is the leader of the coalmine and he sees his son, not the football-playing one, having a future in coal mining. Homer, however, has a different idea about his future. It is an amazing transformation. When we are first introduced to Homer he gives off an impression of naivet\u00e9. He seems like a kid who would be perfect for living a simple life and not one of brilliance or determination. But, as the film goes along we realize he isn't made for football. He wasn't put here for coal-mining. He is a kid with his own dreams and choices. His biggest cheerleader is his mother, Elsie (Natalie Canerday), who feverishly, but very quietly helps push her son along on his quest. She always supported Homer.The first few minutes of the film shows us the day that the Russian satellite Sputnik 1 was sent up into orbit and as it crosses over the West Virginia skies it sets a tone that travels through the rest of this great film. It tells us about how paranoid Americans were when the Russians got into space first. The idea of the Russians taking pictures of our bases and spying on us is explored and the veil of paranoia that always accompanies moments in history is felt heavily at the start of the film. The concept of a space race and beating the Russians all begins to take shape.Homer's determination to make his rockets reaches a point where he needs help from others. He enlists the help of two of his high school buddies, Roy Lee Cooke (William Lee Scott) and Sherman O'Dell (Chad Lindberg). In a move to further his cause, he enlists the aid of a kid in school, who no one really talks to. It shows to us how much Homer's character already has evolved. Pushing aside juvenile prejudices, his own pride and reputation, Homer extends an olive branch to Quentin Wilson (Chris Owen), a nerdy math genius. Also in his canon is the major support they get from their science teacher, Frieda J. Riley (Laura Dern). As the film moves along, after setbacks, failed attempts and family interference the boys eventually reach one goal after another. The amazing journey that they take brings on more help as support from friends and family turns into even bigger support when the high school and the whole town begins to cheer for their success. Which brings us back to Homer and his father, John (Cooper).The Cold War/Sputnik aspect is only a small fragment of what this film is about. The space race, satellites, America's place in the world and Sputnik are all part of the backdrop to an even bigger part of life. The main core of the film is an excellent study in father and son relationships, and Homer and his father couldn't be more different, as much as they are the same. This is what I meant earlier when I said two worlds of thought emerged out of the launch of Sputnik. The mentality between Homer and his father are total contrasts to each other. It is a collision between old-world thinking (stay down in the coal mine deep in the ground in an industry that is dying), or new-world thinking (go to the stars in a rocket moving straight up). It is the small battles between the father and the son contrasted to the battle of the space race. It is the small battles between classmates and the Principle contrasted to surviving in a coalmine. It juxtaposes the more modern idea that there are a lot of things that kids understand more than their parents do. It is the, always, conflicting, struggle between old-world thinking and the ideas-of-the-future that bind this film together.8.8 (B+ Mygrade) = 8 IMDB.",

            "content": "When the Russians launched Sputnik in 1957, it was something the world viewed with great trepidation. If they had the ability to put something man-made into space, it didn't bode well for the future of the free world. The Cold War was still very much in effect, and most people thought of Sputnik as something to cast a shadow over their freedom.But Homer Hickam saw something different. He saw Sputnik not as an end in itself. But a beginning. A whole new chapter in human history was being written right before our very eyes. The people just couldn't see beyond their own fears.October Sky is one of those surprisingly charming films that even when you sense the film is tugging on the heartstrings, it doesn't feel like manipulation. Perhaps because I'm a sucker for films about the space race. Or maybe because October Sky comes from one of my favourite directors, Joe Johnston.Johnston is a filmmaker best known for rousing action/adventure films like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and The Rocketeer. In fact The Rocketeer could almost be construed as the same film but in a slightly lesser developed form. So OS comes as a nice change of pace. Its more leisurely than Johnston's norm but that's OK. The film has excitement alright. Just of a different sort.When Homer first spots Sputnik gliding through the night sky, it is a sight that will change his life forever. Up until that point, Homer's future was very clearly mapped out for him. Once he graduates from high school, he's supposed to work in the local coal mines. Like everybody else.The mine is the town's main source of income. So its very important they get as many workers down there as they can. And for Homer, the pressure is on him especially because his father happens to be the pit foreman.John Hickam (a flawless Chris Cooper) doesn't want his son wasting his time building rockets. Homer knows his future is tied up in engineering, but John thinks the needs of their town are more important.Homer refuses to accept a life in the mines, and convinces a few other boys at school to join together and build a rocket. But the Rocket Boys (as they come to be known) face stiff opposition from just about everybody. The school principal. Their peers. And especially John.October Sky, based on the manuscript by Homer Hickam Jr is one of the nicest films you'll catch on TV. Its slightly underrated, even if its no classic. But it has a really excellent cast. And it does a surprisingly good job of sidestepping the clich\u00e9s inherently buried in the narrative.There does seem a slight predictability to the film. Things like the stern, traditionalist father. The idealistic young man who dreams of the future. Opposition from all sides. The helpful teacher who's more enlightened than the rest.But surprisingly, the film succeeds more often than the above paragraph would suggest. Johnston has chosen a fine cast to remedy any possible uncertainties. Although Jake Gyllenhaal didn't make public notice until Donnie Darko, he more than proves his worth as Homer. October Sky was Gyllenhaal's first starring role. And already he shows his budding talent. Gyllenhaal always projects a fierce determination hidden behind an amiable expression. In Donnie Darko it was particularly startling. Homer of course is a complete opposite, but Gyllenhaal channels it into his ambition to prove his worth, and make a life for himself outside of a coal mine.Joe Johnston is always notable for drawing out strong, gracious performances from children, and he seems equally at home directing teenagers as well. Any scene with the Rocket Boys is thankfully devoid of over-sentiment and slush. Sometimes it threatens to. But it never boils over.And in regards to the adult cast, they do their part as well. Laura Dern is always good value and so she is here as Miss Riley, the schoolteacher open to Homer's ambitions. Her terminal illness does seem to emerge too quickly though, given a curious lack of buildup by Johnston.But its Chris Cooper who steals the show as John. He does wonders with the role of a father set in his ways. He never seems a one-dimensional tyrant. There are subtleties in his acting if you look hard enough. He may disapprove of Homer's activities, but I think hidden in his words is a grudging respect for Homer. And Cooper shows all this with a prolonged silence or a casual glance.Don't forget, John never outright stands in the way of Homer. He could have done any number of times and refuses. I think John is concerned Homer may be setting himself up to be disappointed. And wants to spare him that. John may have had ambitions at a young age too, and circumstances robbed him of that dream. Perhaps he wants to save Homer the same fate. Its all very fascinating when you think about it. A quite faultless performance on Cooper's part.There is the inevitable happy ending. And a few inevitable bumps in the road to get there. But October Sky is a fine, unpatronising film well worth your time. Plenty of 50s tunes to enjoy. And a nice consideration for the plight of the working man, and achieving what may seem hopeless dreams.",

            "content": "My Science Teacher let me borrow a film for the past weekend and I picked October Sky. I of course looked at the reviews of IMDb to see if it was any good. After seeing the many positive reviews I decided to sit and watch it.The film is about Homer Hickam played by Jake Gyllenhaal and his 3 friends Quentin played by Chris Owens, Roy Lee played by William Lee Scott, and O'Dell played by Chad Lindenburg who witness the first artificial satellite named Sputnik go into orbit in October of 1957. This prompts Homer and his friends to build a series of rockets and try to launch them into orbit. However his father played by Chris Cooper wants him to work in the coal mine much to Homers dissatisfaction.This was really good. The film is not your normal '50's movie like Grease(1978) this one takes a more serious route. The things I like about it: I love the performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper, The plot captures what the real Homer Hicam did and yes this is based on a true story. I love how the movie is not to serious and how it does have humor in it. The only thing with this movie that I have a problem with is the Language. Yes I know I watch a lot of films with strong language but this is rated PG. Just because a movie has a PG Rating doesn't mean you have to use a ton of language once in a while it's fine, but not in every scene. I still say it is a very fun movie to watch.Rated PG For Language, Brief Teen Sensuality And Alcohol Use, And For Some Thematic Elements.1hr 48min/108min.****/****",

But the movie is more than that - it's a message to all Americans: if you work hard at something you want, you can achieve it; furthermore, people will eventually respect you for being good at what you do. But, whatever you do, don't quit.A great movie to sit a pre-teen (or a teenager) down with, and an even better movie to watch as an adult for its amusing and heart-warming scenes, not to mention its endearing plotline.It may look pretty dull in the video store, but it is well worth it!Oh, and if you like the movie, check out the book (\"Rocket Boys\") too!",

He's inspired one night by the soviet satellite Sputnik streaking across the sky - a small bright dot that sparks an aspiration to build a rocket.It's a lovely film about believing in yourself when others don't. Homer doesn't have the faith of his family to succeed and his efforts are discouraged by most of his peers at school. But he perseveres, fuelled by an intense admiration for the science of his self-given project as well as the help from his friends to achieve something extraordinary.Bolstered by strong performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper as well as excellent work from composer Mark Isham, 'October Sky' is a moving and rewarding drama that lands its emotional ending.8/10",

Homer's father John (Chris Cooper) advances quite high in the company as a shift supervisor/foreman, and he loves his work. He's good at it. The film provides enough footage to educate us to a minimal level that working down here wasn't Hell, rather it's a job requiring hard bodies, tougher minds, and constant focus on what the flock one is doing. Slipups are easy, but teamwork and dedication bring success. (Kind of like a good football team.)Anyway, Homer's dad is a comparative VIP in this working-man world, and none too happy when Homer\u2014who is athletically challenged\u2014announces he's going to build a rocket. ...For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2009",

So, I journeyed down the sidewalk to the local theater, bought some popcorn, and prepared myself for a nice, \"boring\" matinee on an extremely cold day in Boston.My conclusion...I loved it. Admittingly, I'm a pushover for American dramas, and although this movie didn't involve the decorated war hero or the powerful statesman, it definately gives the viewer a warm feeling upon leaving the theater. Centered around Homer's struggle with his father and a determination to design a rocket, the film does justice in proving that the American Dream still exists. Furthermore, solid performances from a young cast and an emotional, thought provoking musical score added to its appeal.I am looking forward to more films like \"October\" in the future.",

The film has a remarkable sense of time and place using music of the period and the superb production design of Barry Robinson. It's hard to believe that the film was filmed entirely on sets. The mining town is grittily realistic.Jake Gyllehaal gives a fine performance as the leader of the quartet of youthful scientists. Chris Cooper portrays his father, foreman of the coal mine. Their scenes together are moving and emotionally satisfying. Although the outcome is predictable, the finale has that lump-in-the-throat upbeat climax.This is a fine film for teenagers and young people.

Young Homer, the same as young Billy, grows up in a coal-mining area, his father works in the colliery, but the youngster is dead set on not having to dig out his living a kilometre or so underground. Billy wanted to be a ballet dancer; Homer was inspired on building rockets after seeing the first Sputnik fly across Virginia skies. Nicely filmed, with Isham again doing the musical honours satisfactorily, the setting of the film in the late fifties of the last century is magnificent with exactly right automobiles and clothing and the interiors of houses, as well as, I must add, correct concept of people's mentalities of the times.This is a film to admire and enjoy, even though you may frequently find yourself thinking you wrote the script, as the chain of events is rather foreseeable, and thus do not expect surprises. However, it is enjoyable watching films with a story to tell without a load of violence and sordid sex as excuses for putting anything and everything on celluloid. One does get tired of such trash, though it would seem that Hollywood does not.\nOctober Sky is refreshing and sober, though faulting in rather tweeish principles, the same as Billy Elliot at times; but in both cases the result is an entertaining and clean couple of hours.",

Even when it was in the theatres, the commercials and ads did not jump out and grab your attention like the other movies did. For this reason, I was not compelled to watch it right away until recently.October Sky is a true story about a small town boy's dreams and his father's hopes. Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a young man in a small mining town that faces the very real possibility that he will grow up and become a miner just like every other young man in town. After the launch of the Soviet satellite, Sputnik, and witnessing it pass overhead one night, Homer becomes inspired to build his own toy rocket and have it successfully launch. Together with his friends and a local school nerd that he befriends, the group set out to build this rocket despite the ridicule from the rest of the students and town people. His biggest opponent of this little project is his father, which has aspirations of Homer becoming a miner. To his father's dismay, Homer decides that mining is not his future and with the encouragement of his school teacher, Miss Freida Riley (Laura Dern), he sets out to learn everything he knows about rockets to enter a science fair.Although the storyline sounds rather simple, Homer's personal plight is quite complicated. Throughout the movie you see the growing rift between himself and his father (and occasionally his friends) and there is a point in the story that he must make the very difficult decision of continuing this project or trying to please his father. The appealing thing about this movie is that this is a story that many people can relate to and understand.The acting in this movie was very well done, especially by Jake Gyllenhaal (Homer Hickam). The rest of the actors add a real genuine feel to it and throughout the film you get a real sense of the surpressive atmosphere of the father. This is also one of the few movies I've seen where there were very few slow spots. It is by no means an action filled movie but the story is told in such a way that you do not get a sense that there is information being given to you that you don't need. Laura Dern plays the role of Miss Riley fairly well although her involvement in the movie is relatively minor despite the way she's portrayed in the advertising (ie. her picture on the poster).The one thing that I do have to point out is that, throught this story, you get the sense that Miss Riley has a very large role in Homer's life yet the director never quite develops this relationship. In the end I felt the story was lacking a little in this aspect and you are left making assumptions to fill in the gaps that you sense.Overall, this is one of the best films that I've seen in a long time. It doesn't have the spectacular special effects or the complicated action sequences but the story is very well told. This is especially the case when you consider the fact that this was a true story. The director wraps up the end movie very well by showing you photos of the real people that the actors portrayed and detailing what each of them went on to do in their lives. This is definitely a movie you should see.",

I believe wholeheartedly that 'October Sky' is one of those movies. Like the best before it, 'Casablanca', 'The Third Man', 'Moonstruck', 'Amadeus', 'Almost Famous', this movie sits like a restful beacon of light in an otherwise bleak horizon of cinema. What well separates it from those that have gone before, is that 'October Sky' resides in the heart like postcards from your favorite aunt, or memories of Mom's apple pie or taking a trip back home. It stirs and then settles deep within and promises life anew and hope for the future. One can say that it is, after all, just a movie. But I believe that it is more than that. Its a movie that promises that when we reach beyond ourselves, and hope when hope fails, that our tomorrow beckons us with opens arms, and calls us warmly home. I gladly, unreservedly give 'October Sky' a 10 out of ten stars.",

From the very opening moments to the very end, it's just beautifully done. If you're looking for dangerous, heart-pounding, shoot-em-up action, don't rent this movie; this isn't a film of that genre. That's not to say it's boring -- far from it. But this is a movie about life, specifically the true-life late 1950's story of a high-school boy named Homer who, inspired by world events and his teacher, found that his dreams were bigger than the tiny West Virginia town he grew up in. Those dreams were sparked by something that appeared in the October sky of 1957.Interestingly, rearrange the letters of the movie and you get the original title of the book the movie is based upon:\"October Sky\" <===> \"Rocket Boys\"This is not a video to rent. This is a video to OWN, especially if you have kids. You'll watch it several times, forget about it for a year, pull it out again, and then enjoy it just as much when you dust it off. If you're going to be watching it with younger kids, be advised that the film does contain some of what we in our family call \"rude language\" (nothing your kids aren't going to hear sooner or later anyway, or have already heard if they go to public school -- but a bit of parental discretion with younger kids advised)",

I mean you could take the most cynical, mysanthropic soul on this planet, have him watch \"October Sky\", and he'd have a healthier outlook on his life. I swear, during the last 10 minutes of this movie, I had the biggest grin on my face - one of those endings you just can't help but get caught up in. The film features an abundant amount of fine performances. Namely, Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Homer Hickam, and Chris Cooper's compelling turn as his father, John. Other great performances came from Laura Dern, Chris Owen, William Lee Scott, and Chad Lindberg. The movie is shot to a magnificent degree. For instance, Cinematographer Fred Murphy really uses dismal lighting to magnify the miserable atmosphere within Coalwood, West Virginia. The movie is also edited to a tee. \"October Sky\" also possesses a brilliantly written screenplay that effectively tells the story with emotion as well as convey the narratives heartwarming themes. Overall, I feel that \"October Sky\" is an awe-inspiring coming-of-age tale of perseverance, respect, and hope. It's a movie that everyone can learn something from \u2013 I know I did.",

It is pure joy to watch Jake Gyllenhaal (CITY SLICKERS), Chris Owen (AMERICAN PIE, SHE'S ALL THAT), Chad Lindberg (CITY OF ANGELS, MERCURY RISING), and William Lee Scott (THE OPPOSITE OF SEX, GATTACA) overcome the dragging small-town thinking to succeed in reaching for the stars.  These young actors more than hold their own against Laura Dern (CITIZEN RUTH, RAMBLING ROSE) and the always superb character actor, Chris Cooper (AMERICAN BEAUTY, LONE STAR) who plays Jake Gyllenhaal's dad.  Director Joe Johnston (ROCKETEER) has managed to take the autobiography of Homer Hickam, Jr. (aka ROCKET BOYS) and made it into a living, breathing organism of a film.  For younger people like myself, the concept of the Hoovertown/mining town (and its oppressiveness) portrayed in the film has always remained somewhat dead on the pages of history books. Mr. Johnston, through his cast, crew, and through Mr. Hickam's words, has breathed a life in to it.  This film belongs in the canon alongside such other modern classics (in the overcoming-adversity-and-generally-uplifting genre) as John G. Avildsen's ROCKY.  Rent it, read it, buy it (the DVD is gorgeous), but above all savor it with all in your family.",

            "content": "I wasn't around for the 1950's, at the height of the Cold War, but I've read enough to know the sense of fear and even paranoia that those days inspired in people. Perhaps the height of the Cold War came in 1957, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik - the first artificial satellite to orbit the earth. \"October Sky\" opens with the launch of Sputnik, and that opening captures very well the sense of fear that overtook one town - Coalwood, West Virginia as news of the launch spread. But it wasn't all fear. To some it was inspiration. Coalwood was exactly what the name sounds like - a coal mining town, whose people were basically expected to live and die in the coal mines, with few opportunities to get out. But watching Sputnik soar through the sky overhead inspired high school student Homer Hickham (a wonderful performance by Jake Gyllenhaal) to want something more. He along with several friends become rocket enthusiasts, dreaming of escaping the dreary little town and of doing greater things, with the support of a sympathetic high school science teacher (played by Laura Dern).I wouldn't call this a riveting movie. It is - once again - the classic formula of the underdog striving to overcome. Coalwood isn't expected to produce rocket scientists. Aside from the odd football player, it produces coal miners, and Homer has to overcome the doubts of many in the town, and especially his own father (Chris Cooper), who is the boss of the local mine, whose life is dedicated to mining, and who naturally assumes that his son Homer (who, unlike his brother, has no football talent) will simply follow in his footsteps. The inspirational story aside, it's probably the uncomfortable relationship of father and son that's the centrepiece of \"October Sky.\" The relationship of father to the two sons who are so opposite in so many ways reminded me of an almost identical scene in \"Stand By Me\" as Homer strives for his father's attention, while his father is only concerned with talking about his brother's football games. That all takes place within the backdrop of a dying town completely dependent on one industry, whose people are scared - because they see the end coming and they see no future once the end comes. So, inspiring though it may be, there's also a sadness to this movie - a sadness at a way of life that's dying, a sadness for the people who have spent their lives and sometimes given their lives (or at least their health) for the sake of that way of life.It's impressive to see the dedication that Homer and his friends showed in the face of doubts and opposition from those around them, as their rocket science experiments finally take them to the National Science Fair, and gives them the opportunity to break free of what had seemed to be their destiny. And yet, while one understands that the story is the inspirational story of these boys striving for something bigger, one also gains respect for those in Coalwood. They're hard-working men, who give of themselves and who risk a lot for the sake of their families. Sometimes the dreary life overcomes them, with sad results, but there's still a measure of respect for them. So I thought this represented a good look at both sides of the question - those who dream of bigger things, and those who may have lost that dream, but who still do the best they can with what they have.In the end, it becomes a bit of a tear-jerker in a number of ways. It may not be a riveting movie, but it represents a good slice of life movie, and it seems to depict the thinking of the era and that particular environment quite well. (6/10)",

Also, I co-founded a rocket club when I was about 15 years old, so, again, the movie had added relevancy to my life. But I don't think these elements are necessary for anyone who believes in following their dreams. The acting is very good (anything I've ever seen with Laura Dern in it has appealed). Kudos to the musical soundtrack which hit all the right notes for me. And if the idea of soaring to the heavens captures your imagination, you will likely find this movie time very well spent.",

He certainly carries the movie as best anyone could, and proves his talent - I'm glad it was able to serve that purpose for him, because he's given us many great films at this point in 2020. However, I can't say the same about October Sky.I'm sure this true story was very sentimental to the people involved, but WOW does it make a dull film. It's really by-the-numbers all the way through - it all feels so formulaic and bland. Even Laura Dern doesn't get the opportunity to bring much to her character - really it could have been any actress - it feels more like a money job for her, which I would never hold against anyone for taking. Chris Cooper is almost entirely unlikeable as always - that's his specialty, but even with his usual menace, his character was far more uninteresting than his others. It's a tastefully done film, it's just really quite boring all the the way through - and the tone remains...consistent.This feels like a movie you would watch in class in junior high...only it would be one of the less good ones. Mississippi Burning is more my vibe guess. Would not recommend this to anyone really. Sorry y'all!",

There is a distinct sadness to it despite its uplifting mood of telling the story of Homer Hickam's success in following his dream and getting out of the miserable situation in a 1950's West Virginia coal town.The sadness is ever present: in the hopelessness and eventual end of the coal towns and the toll they took on a generation of workers; Frieda Riley's Hodgkin's disease; the struggle to overcome an unfortunate hand dealt by economics, society, and location; the lack of understanding between the generations all combine into a truly unforgettable movie.And yet, overall it is these very examples of the sadness that raises this movie into one of the most inspiring and uplifting films of the past quarter century.This was the very first movie I ever purchased on DVD back in 1999 and it has remained one of my absolute favorites for 21 years.And I 'm certain that the next time I'm channel surfing and happen upon October Sky, I'll definitely stop and watch it even if it is the 50th or 60th time I've seen it.",

Jake Gyllenhaal dreams of going to space and builds miniature rockets. After he and his friends wreck his mother's white picket fence, he turns to the unpopular book worm for help. The rest consists of rocket launching tests to enter the science fair. Filled with stereotypes including the unpopular class nerd, the supportive ill health teacher, the hard nose principal, the popular girl, and Chris Cooper with the dreary role of discouraging father. Director Joe Johnston establishes the 1957 setting with fantastic rocket launching footage but unfortunately he launches a screenplay full of clich\u00e9s and stereotypes. This is a different type of film for a director known for Jumanji and The Rocketeer. Gyllenhaal basically goes with the flow playing the boy who must prove himself and gain his father's approval. Cooper's role is equally xeroxed as his father. Watching a sitcom father and son is far more interesting than anything these two do in this film. Laura Dern plays the teacher who is ill yet encouraging. Chris Owen completes the stereotypes as the nerd. The film is well made on a technical level but fails on the story front. Theme regards dreams within a screenplay that doesn't fly so high. Score: 5 / 10",

Was not too impressed at first until I learned it was a real life story of a man named Homer Hickam from the coal mining area of West Virginia who was more interested in rockets after he saw Sputnik. At that period of time I had just gotten married, stationed in the D. C. area and was watching the sky like everybody else, but saw nothing. Here's the chill part!! I never heard of Homer Hickam until 24 hours ago. On the news tonight, 1/15/06, there was a memorial service for those miners who died in the mines early this week. A man was speaking to the crowd..a name came on the screen, Homer Hickam! 1/16/06. After seeing the movie again, I was moved by the story and really enjoyed it and it brought back memories of that period. Had to change to a 10. I must say, a very wonderful movie, hated to take it back. All were new actors to me except Homer Sr, and Laura Dern. They were all just great and I'm usually critical of new faces.",

Now, I have seen this film when it first came out and I wasn't very fond of it. I had the chance to re-view it and I remember why I disliked it. It was very boring and dull. Now I know its based on a true story and I understand what that means, but I didn't really like the sorry. It just seemed too boring at many parts, and it was very predictable. The characters were okay but in general not that great. Jake Gyllenhaal's acting was decent as the lead but it was his friends and others whose acting was lacking. This movie is basically about a guy- Homer Hickam (Gyllenhaal) whose has dreams of creating his own rocket because of one he recently sen on television. He eventually creates it and ends up winning in their science fair. Everything was predictable. Also this story was based in the 50's so that's why they all speak like that and the way they wear their clothing. The rockets were nice and all but overall this movie is lacking of excitement and entertainment. Its just not for everyone, and that is clear. Bad movie, don't watch it",

This movie was one of the best movies in 1999, as review aggregator, Rotten Tomatoes, reports that 90% out of 72 critics gave the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.6/10: \"Rich in sweet sincerity, intelligence, and good old-fashioned inspirational drama, October Sky is a coming-of-age story with a heart to match its Hollywood craftsmanship. Also this movie won Critics' Choice Movie Awards for Best Family Film from the Broadcast Film Critics Association in 2000.It beautifully illustrates the biography of a teen Homer who is ambitious towards rocket science and ends up to be a scientist at NASA despite of all the mishappenings he faces in life. The story is a gem for the teens who are often led down by their dreams and dear ones. Full of emotions and zeal, the movie buys one a lot of encouragement to follow ones dreams.It proved very helpful to me and as it would be to all the people who have been facing a very hard time in life and not been able to do what they want to. The plot and the acting of the cast starring Chris Cooper, Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Owen is great and hence this movie easily and beautifully connects to people who got mind-stuck in teenage. As one would expect from Universal studios, the production house of the movie, the scenes combined with the acting is so real that it will take oneself back to the teen life of 1950's in America, which in itself is a wonderful experience. I would strongly recommend this movie to all the people reading this review.",

            "content": "\"October Sky\" is alot of different types of movies rolled all together. It's a coal-mining movie.  It's a \"follow your dreams\" movie.  It's a period piece.  However, at the heart of the film is the most accurate and poignant portrayal of the father/son dynamic that I have ever seen in a film.Homer Hickham is a son who has been told since the day he was born that he was going to grow up to work in the coal mines.  That is what everyone before him has done and all of his contemporaries have resigned themselves to the fact that that is what they will do.  However, Homer wants to build rockets and he seesa first prize at the national science fair as a ticket out of Coalwood and straight to college.  Homer's father has worked in the mines his whole life and sees nothing practical or worthwhile in Homer's fascination with rockets, but, more importantly, he sees Homer's desire to leave as a huge insult.  He thinks that Homer wants to get away from the town so that he doesn't have to follow in his father's footsteps.The interaction between father and son is at once frustrating, hurtful, loving, insightful and bittersweet.  There are always kind words that can't be spoken and harsh words that can't help but be shouted.  This realism is at the core of this incredibly moving screenplay, which is only made palpable by the equally moving performances.If you are looking for a great drama that is family appropriate, smartly written and inspiring, I highly recommend this little-known gem!",

            "content": "-----ONE OR TWO SPOILERS AHEAD------Looking around the comments index and this film gets deserved praise. Inspirational is the best word to describe its main theme: small town boy and friends rise up against their pre-ordained careers as coal miners to pursue rocket science. Gyllenhaal does a wonderful job as the seemingly not so bright daydreamer who one day looks up in awe at the vision of the Russian satellite 'Sputnik' (the first space 'vehicle' to be launched into orbit by man) and decides to reach for the stars. The townspeople are also fascinated and yet scared of this new thing streaking across the sky which some believe to be of imminent danger to them. But as they look up, a wonderful comment comes out from the crowd which to me sums up the hard pressed, struggling yet somehow joyous spirit of this community. A man says 'I hope they don't drop a bomb on this place.....it'd be a terrible waste of a bomb!' There must have been thousands of small yet spiritied communities like this in the US during the 50s. And it's from this essential ruggedness, and perhaps innocence, I suppose young men like Homer Hickam were launched into the world. Hickam's father's initial relutance to support his son's 'crazyness' is understandable considering the great sacrifices and suffering he and his colleagues down the mines have given in order to give their children a decent living. Gradually though, the barriers are worn down and perhaps the gifts of Homer inspire something different in his father as we are drawn to the inevitable conclusion.One thing that puzzled me throughout though was the attitude and respect given to a certain Wernher von Braun. Fair enough, the man was a rocketing genius but his full scale participation in and innovative designs for the V1 and V2 rockets of Nazi Germany led to the deaths of thousands of innocents (both rocket victims and the actual slave labourers). Perhaps one of the morals of the film is that greatness in human advance and technology can ultimately be born from the more malignant and terrifying aspects in our nature. Thus Hickam embarks on a career as a rocket scientist and his inspiration is a former Nazi rocket scientist! The other aspect to the film was moving too. The irony of a Soviet satellite inspiring a 17 year old American to go out and design rockets to launch into space. There's a profound lesson here for cooperation amongst different peoples and nations. Great film!",

I saw people commenting about the whole town coming to see the rocket launch well i think its a symbolic gesture, as those rockets stand for hope and belief and thats what this movie is all about. If you can see Forrest gump with the same eye it's without sense but that movie also depicts the victory of human spirit over all overwhelming odds to have faith when everyone looses it. The only people who can be cynical about this film are those who have given up and in their despair see everything beautiful as a threat,, pity them.

Although my years near there occurred later than Homer Hickam's, I can see so many things in common with his experience in Coalwood and my own growing up.When an earlier comment about his movie said that it was just another movie about adversity and overcoming odds, I don't think they quite understand the point. Homer Hickam grew up in a place that was far away from anything -- even the math book he needed for building the rockets had to be ordered because although it wasn't stated, I assume that at that time there was no library around that carried such a book. Just think about that for a moment. It's very difficult for young people in that area to see anything more in their lives than what they see outside their windows. I'm sure the same could be said for some urban kids who live in depressed areas. But, I would be less impressed with this story if Homer Hickam grew up in suburban New Jersey or urban Chicago, for example, where so much of the world is just a few minutes away and finding people to help you is so easy. Remember, Homer had to walk 8 miles just to leave coal company property, and the men at the coal company who supported him did so even though they risked losing their jobs (and there were no other jobs to be had).Luckily, Homer had a teacher who recognized a student with a dream and potential. Homer was a student in the middle of the pack (academically and socially) who dared to defy the odds. Even Quentin, the brain, needed Homer. In fact, one of the things that clearly separates this movie from so many other stories of achievement is that it was done academically.While sports achievements are great, why do so many movie makers shy away from other achievements? Many people in Coalwood didn't care too much for academic achievements, but tackle somebody on the football field and you are off to college. Too many people glamorize sports, and as time marches on we have more and more examples of exactly how unglamorous (and felonious) some sports figures are. It's impossible to compare a touchdown with a rocket going to the moon (at least aimed at it). Homer didn't make a touchdown, but if he had it would just mean a trip to Disneyworld. Instead, Homer built rockets and there is no end to where he can go except in his dreams. Truly, an inspirational movie!",

Having just finally read it, I had to re-watch the film, which I'd seen over ten years ago. For those who don't like the movie, read the book, and watch the Bonus extras on the disk. You'll find they did an excellent job of extracting and displaying on screen perhaps 25% of this non-fiction story's elements. What you get is a sweet (not necessarily saccharin, rather \"sweet\" as in well-crafted), feel-good family fare flick, but not the gritty and far more real complete story, which included more characters and conflicts, and especially the interaction between the boy and his mother, and how she balanced out the tough-love family equation.In real life Homer's mother did a lot more than cook, wash, and gripe a bit about the company coal mine as June Lockhart from \"Lassie\" might have done. She could be, and was, scathingly, bitterly, ironically funny in the face of the daily potential for disaster, of the mine killing her husband and setting the family adrift. If the father was a force to be reckoned with, wait'll you meet Homer's actual mother, not the Mrs. Cleaver version they depicted in \"October Sky\" the movie. This is one jumping off place requiring a mini-series, and where the incomparable Laura Dern could have really done some serious work, had they cast her in that role playing opposite Chris Cooper but, this is an inspirational family flick, not reality.In the book, Elsie's got a husband devoted more to managing a deadly company town operation than his own family, an occupation thousands of feet underground, on call 24x7; an eldest son devoting himself to a potentially crippling sport which might or might not get him out of Coalwood WV and the inevitable life underground; and a youngest son who decides he wants to experiment in the basement with potentially deadly projectiles fueled by violently volatile chemical mixtures, testing them in the furnace of the coal-fired hot water heater and drying them out for days underneath it. Her sardonic, ironic response to him when he announces he wants to do this (and a few times thereafter): \"Don't blow yourself up.\" As she continually paints an idyllic beach scene on a canvas hanging on the kitchen wall...for several years.Homer could've blown the house up. Brother Jim could've been permanently disabled. Her husband faced death daily (either from black lung or a mine disaster) in which case the company would've given her two weeks to move the family out of Coalwood, who knows where.They didn't hit that one hard enough in this Disney-like film. I give it an 8 for taking a far more serious work and pulling together enough elements to create a good family flick. A movie the whole family can watch together...just not Homer's real family, who were if anything, more dysfunctional than most. Fabulous job of autobiographical writing, great job of movie-making based on it. The one is not entirely the other. That's okay, the movie stands on its own.",

Updated releases ought to reflect this.The film is strangely obsessed with the idea that people cannot get out of their small town or escape the coal mine. Was this true in the 1950s?

            "content": "I'm sure things didn't exactly go the same way in the real life of Homer Hickam as they did in the film adaptation of his book, Rocket Boys, but the movie \"October Sky\" (an anagram of the book's title) is good enough to stand alone. I have not read Hickam's memoirs, but I am still able to enjoy and understand their film adaptation. The film, directed by Joe Johnston and written by Lewis Colick, records the story of teenager Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), beginning in October of 1957.  It opens with the sound of a radio broadcast, bringing news of the Russian satellite Sputnik, the first artificial satellite in orbit. We see a images of a blue-gray town and its people: mostly miners working for the Olga Coal Company. One of the miners listens to the news on a hand-held radio as he enters the elevator shaft, but the signal is lost as he disappears into the darkness, losing sight of the starry sky above him. A melancholy violin tune fades with this image. We then get a jolt of Elvis on a car radio as words on the screen inform us of the setting: October 5, 1957, Coalwood, West Virginia. Homer and his buddies, Roy Lee Cook (William Lee Scott) and Sherman O'Dell (Chad Lindberg), are talking about football tryouts. Football scholarships are the only way out of the town, and working in the mines, for these boys. \"Why are the jocks the only ones who get to go to college,\" questions Homer. Roy Lee replies, \"They're also the only ones who get the girls.\" Homer doesn't make it in football like his older brother, so he is destined for the mines, and to follow in his father's footsteps as mine foreman. Until he sees the dot of light streaking across the October sky. Then he wants to build a rocket. \"I want to go into space,\" says Homer. After a disastrous attempt involving a primitive rocket and his mother's (Natalie Canerday) fence, Homer enlists the help of the nerdy Quentin Wilson (Chris Owen). Quentin asks Homer, \"What do you want to know about rockets?\" Homer quickly anwers, \"Everything.\" His science teacher at Big Creek High School, Miss Frieda Riley (Laura Dern) greatly supports Homer, and the four boys work on building rockets in Homer's basement. His father, however, whose life is the mine, does not support him. John Hickam (Chris Cooper) believes that Homer shouldn't waste his time on the rockets, that the coal mines are all that matter. The coal from the mines is used to make steel, and without steel, the country would be nothing. The difficult relationship between Homer and his dad is one of the most poignant relationships I have ever seen in a film. Miss Riley introduces Homer to the idea of entering the local science fair, with a chance to go the nationals and win a college scholarship. \"You can't just dream your way out of Coalwood,\" she tells Homer. Homer and his friends act upon their dreams by working constantly on the rockets, improving the models with each attempt. Despite the many attempts, the boys do not lose their determination. \"What are the chances of us winning that science fair,\" O'Dell asks Homer in one of their more despairing moments. \"A million to one,\" answers Homer. \"That good?\" O'Dell replies, \"Well, why didn't you say so?\" The music, composed by Mark Isham, conveys sadness and hope at the same time, especially sad at a point when Homer descends into the mine shaft and loses sight of the sky and his dreams of getting out of Coalwood. Rollicking 1950s' rock and roll, including songs by The Coasters and Buddy Holly, occasionally pushes the instrumental pieces aside to create a light-hearted mood that contrasts the teenagers' lives with the lives of the miners. The film, photographed by Fred Murphy, also uses colors to set moods and symbolize. The town of Coalwood, actually filmed in Tennessee, is washed with blues, grays, and browns. It's as if the grime from the coal sticks to everything- faces, clothes, houses, and roads. When a couple in a gleaming red convertible stops to ask for directions from the boys, it is obvious that they are from the world outside of Coalwood and the Olga Coal Company. The book on guided missile design that Miss Riley gives Homer is red. The red stands out enough against the blue-gray world of Coalwood to symbolize \"getting out\", but it is still subtle. The reds are fleeting hints of a world that Homer only dreams of. Jake Gyllenhaal expresses such zeal, hope, and pertinacity as Homer Hickam that it is hard to believe he isn't the real Homer we see in actual footage at the end of the film. Chris Cooper is also extraordinarily believable as Homer's stubborn father, who doesn't recognize, or just doesn't want to admit, that the mine is not producing enough to keep the town alive. Homer, and everyone who encourages him in his rocket-building, is aware that the town is dying. With the community disintegrating, the only way they stay together is by gathering for the rocket boys' demonstrations. Again, I'm sure things didn't happen exactly as the movie portrayed them, but what would a movie be without a bit of idealism? \"October Sky\" has just enough of that to make it a great motion picture and enough rawness to keep it real.",

The film is very light, there are no big performances, scenes or acting; everything is just so average and uninteresting that I lost my attention a lot of times.

I strongly recommend it, especially because it really does feel like it comes from a lot of undeniable passion, a lot of true inspiration and a true interest in the subject, in a way that doesn't ring false or comes across as contrived or trying to garner emotion or sympathy that isn't warranted at all.

I read the book this is based on, and like this movie, it's best when it focuses on the science part.  It's careful and probing, and it doesn't overwhelm you with jargon talk.  And you get to see the many mistakes before the eventual triumph.  But the rest of the movie falls a little short.  The sentiment was there in the book too, but it wasn't as blunt as it is here.  There are too many cliches, and a few changes(like having the teacher being able to see the final rocket launch from her hospital bed; in reality, if memory serves, she had already died).

            "content": "Based on the memoirs of real life NASA engineer Homer Hickam, October Sky (an anagram for the novel 'Rocket Boys') was indeed a great family film. October Sky also stands for the date, Oct. 4, 1957 where Soviet satellite Sputnik 1 spark the Space race, and Homer Hickam's dreams of building rockets. The reason why October Sky was chosen by the studio over Rocket Boys is because they thought it wouldn't sell with women. Universal Pictures changed the title to be more inviting to a wider audience and thus it did work. Indeed, the title, October Sky has a little more feel to it, than Rocket Boys anyways. In the film, Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), a coal miner's son sees this as an inspired to take up rocketry against his father's wishes played by the great actor Chris Cooper as John Hickam. Only Chris Cooper can load that much dignity in silence and fire off like rocket with his body language. Amazing. Just the way, that Jake and Chris's characters butt heads in this movie is intense. Both have fears and reasons to do what they do. Homer's father wasn't cruel, he was old fashioned. Homer was trying to break the mold, John had been in coal mining for his life and he came from a generation grounded. Homer wanted to fly and get out and John couldn't see it. Both characters love each other, father and son wise, but with careers, it was father VS son indeed. This movie is a capable-enough movie on its own right, and it's really serve as a great father's day movie as well. The movie teaches parents to be more open to their children's own plans for their lives, while also the world that is ever so changing. The scene where Homer tells his father who his hero is, is very emotion. Great scene, indeed. The supporting cast was great as well. Homer gets help building with his friends, Quetin (Chris Owen), Roy (William Lee Scott) and O-Dell (Chad Lindberg). It's weird in the book, Homer was more the nerd, and Quetin is the all-around kid and in the film, they change parts and looks. All likable charming American character with some background sub-plot story arches for themselves as well like Roy Lee's abusive foster father. Lot of laughs and smiles to go with their small scenes of their wacky high-jinx. Laura Dern is pretty good as the Miss Riley, the teacher that get them on the right track by helping with their math and science. However, the film does have some drawbacks. I don't think the film capture the joy and triumph of Hickham's original memoir; as it changes things up to make them more dramatic in the film such as Homer going into the mine to work, Homer meeting Wernher Von Braun and the issues with Miss Riley's health. In real life, she actually lived several years after the movie ended. It tend to jazz up the real life events way too much. There was also the fact that the boys were 8 to 14 at the time not 17. Parents would be complaining that the film is showing young children playing with rockets if they show 8 year olds. Also, Homer was more well-known by his nickname 'Sonny' in his hometown, but I think the movie change it for the better. The movie also has this predictable flat formulaic flow to it that you knew was going to happen. Still, you have to have a hard heart, if you're not moved by the film ending. You knew deep inside from the beginning that this will be a good feel movie with uplifting themes. There is great symbolism of how grounded, the community was in the beginning and how rockets change this area for the better. The movie was such a big hit, that an October Sky festival was host in the town, every year since then. One thing I love about October Sky is a warm, evocative soundtrack. Mark Isham did a great job with the main themes. The violin at the beginning gives me goosebumps every time. Also great use of 1950's to early 1960's songs as well to set the mood and settling. These songs just gives me chills and makes me happy and reminds me that from the humblest of beginnings come the greatest of men. Overall: Joe Johnston's film would inspired others to look into their dreams, while also entertain them with the rich intelligence subject matter mixed with the coming of age story drama. October Sky will continue to help launch new dreams for children and adults wishing to become future rocket scientists for themselves. It's a good watch, and worth checking out.",

To watch the actors, you would think that they are the actual characters. Laura Dern, a favorite actress of mine, left nothing out of her performance. The young actors playing the Rocket Boys showed talent beyond their years, especially young Homer. Homer's father inspired that eternal love/hate relationship between a father and son so that it felt real. If you don't get a lump in your throat or shed a tear when that first successful rocket goes up or when father and son come to terms, then get your pulse checked (you may be dead).",

He loved the pursuit of the dream, the adventure of the boys and at the end, when Homer's father comes to watch the final rocket launch and put his arms around his boy, my son turned and looked at me and understood exactly why I wanted to watch this movie with him. Not many movies can entertain and teach at the same time without being heavy handed. The Director's handling of the father/son relationship was right on.I also love Natalie Cannerday as the mom.

Jake Gyllenhaal is superb as Homer Hickam, I think he's really an \"up-and-coming\" young actor.  Chris Cooper, Laura Dern, Chris Owen, William Lee Scott, Chad Lindberg, and everyone else really deserve some notice this film.  Job well done!  And let's not forget the directing of Joe Johnston! Joe doesn't seem to make bad movies (although I did have some problems with \"Jumanji\", but not much), can't wait to see his next work!I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that is interested in a drama about some young men trying to fulfill their dreams.

This is based on a true story, written by Homer Hickam, of how four friends start to build a rocket in the small city Coalwood, West Virginia, and how they inspire the people of that town by doing the impossible. Except from the story of the building of rockets and how people are both happy and unhappy of it, it is the story of a father and son relation, how a teenager really fights for his dreams, no matter what his father thinks or wants. A beautifully storytelling movie with all glorious moments... that it is a true story makes it more believable, but at the same time also unbelievable.Highly recommended, not only for the fine story but also for fine characters, great actors and a great photography.

They suffered setbacks, took many detours, and endured the scorn of their peers. In the end, they prevailed. The hero's quest is often a lonely one, but can end in success. The film portrays both the adversity and the triumph well.In reading some other reviews, I was saddened to see that people have become so cynical that they cannot imagine that the events happened as they were depicted, that the story was embellished with corny Hollywood cliches.

All the students either end up in the mine or if they're lucky, will get a football scholarship.  Homer is not stupid and knows the mine has no future even though his coal mining dad believes in it strongly.He suddenly sees an opportunity as the Sputnik satellite launch inspires him to build a rocket.  After some total bad starts he makes friends with an ostracized brain named Quentin in school in hopes of gaining success. As his experiments start gaining notoriety his teacher tells him that there is a local science fair and that he should enter.  If he wins he goes to the State Science fair and winners there get schoolarships.  Homer now sees what he wants to be in life and the science fair offers that: the chance to go to college and become an astronaut.  This a great film as Homer battles against all odds that seem destined to overwhelm him, his father's disaproval, the fact he lives in a nowhere small town where no-one does anything outside the mine, a principal who feels the communities students only future is shoveling coal, and no resources to gain knowledge.Great based on true story.

A boy has an interest in an activity not typically associated with his class.  He shows promise and is encouraged by an elder but his family doesn't understand nor support him.  A family tragedy occurs that threatens his future success but in the end he triumphs.  The story is familiar and success is in the telling.  How well do the film makers characterize the participates?  Do they seem real?  Do you develop empathy for them?  In this movie they were successful.  Other movies that follow the same formula aren't as successful. Billy Elliot, in my opinion, though of similar plot structure, (substitute ballet for rocketry), was a failure.

This true, refreshing coming-of-age drama is not only fantastic for its outstanding storyline and screenplay, but also for fine performances of Gyllenhaal,Chris Cooper as Homer's father and Laura Dern as Homer's teacher, his favorite Ms. Riley.The story is mostly set in a time in the late 60s. And, through the course of the film, life of the common people in the downtown area is well featured. Good to see that the film contains very little amount of complex scientific details. Instead, the film mostly focused on Homer's life and his determination to fight back. It also succeeded to feature separate points of view of other supporting characters like Homer's father, mother, his friend Quentin and Ms. Price independently.

The fine direction of Joe Johnston must be mentioned. You will also enjoy the score in the background of the late 50s rock 'n roll tunes. You will laugh and you will cry. The story is true.

It looks like Mr Gyllenhaal will have a HUGE  film career if this is anything to go by. I thought that Joe Johnston was an odd choice as director as he is usually associated woth big budget blockbusters(Jumanji, Honey I shrunk the kids). He pulls of every scene with sheer class. My favourite scene was where Homer is going down the mineshaft and looking at the sky, going down, as all of his dreams were, it was beautiful. Joe Johnston should direct more of these brilliant, acting driven films as well as his Big budget blockbuster faire, which is also excellent. KUDOS!! to all involved in this masterpiece!",

Not to be able to see some timeless classic movies when they first appeared on the big screen, but to have seen and heard some of the more famous events in our life time. \u0091October Sky' focuses on an event that I had never heard of, but If I was born in the right era, I am sure it would have had an influence on individual just like me. This is an inspirational story, that can and will leave you stunned on what you can achieve, if you put your heart and soul into it. In Coalwood, West Virginia, 1957, coal mining is king and no one can escape life underground. But when high school student Homer Hickam, Jr. sees the Soviet satellite Sputnik streak overhead, he aims for the stars and a new destiny in this incredible true story of hope, determination and triumph. With the help of his teacher and three buddies, Homer sets out to build his own rocket. How Homer overcomes seemingly impossible obstacles-poor education, a disapproving father and a series of misfires that threaten to flatten his dreams and the town- and fulfills his vision is the launching pad for one of the most timeless, inspirational stories ever brought to the screen.Jake Gyllenhaal was terrific as the main star of \u0091October Sky'. Homer Hickman, must be an extraordinary personality, and I am sure he would be proud of the performance Gyllenhaal did to this role in a film based on him. Yet I also feel that the boys that backed Homer in his rocketing adventures were also important to the make up of this film. The other young star I know in this movie is who played the character Quentin. He is a good young actor, who has been in the infamous `American Pie' movies. In this film he was completely different, in that he was the nerdy type of guy that everyone avoided at school, yet he also helped pull off what was an amazing feet by such young people.Chris Cooper is the conservative father in this film. In all his films I have found him to be an extremely stubborn character, and he does that in October Sky. He was born to be a very reluctant character. This role reminds me so much of the role he took in the brilliant, \u0091American Beauty'. The other good role in this film was that of Homer's teacher, Miss Riley. Out of all the hindrance the boys get to there dream, they have a help in a teacher that wants them to succeed. Miss Riley was portrayed well by Laura Dern.I really felt that this story, though it was based on true life events, was a great premise for a movie. Having the real Homer Hickman write a book really helps the story, then to recreate the time that it was set in, was extremely satisfying for me. I believe the director, Joe Johnston, got the whole mood of the  story just how it was meant to be. I also like how we get to see what the real characters are up to in the end of the film.\nTo say that October Sky \u0091is one of the better films that will uplift and inspire everyone' is pretty obvious. Yet this film also shows me that movies based on true stories can be extremely invaluable, as it can show how great some people really are, if they put their mind to it. This film also proves that parents are not allows right when it comes to knowing what there children want. Instead it makes me certain that parents need to help, rather than hinder there children, because if they don't it could result in people never knowing how great some young people can be. CMRS gives \u0091October Sky': 4.5 (very good \u0096 brilliant film)",

Then sometimes you get those special little movies, the great movies because they have a good story and good acting.  \"October Sky\" falls in the latter, it's a terrific movie that doesn't need effects or the works ofa famous director to make it a great movie.  Instead  the story and characters make it a unique movie, about four young boys who live in a mining town in West Virgina during the launch of Sputnik.  One of the boys, Homer (Jake Gyllenhaal), dreams of making a rocket ship that can one day, go into space.  His father, played by Chris Cooper (my favorite character actor along with Sam Neil) disapproves of this idea and wants young Homer to take over the coal mines when he's older. Following his heart instead of his dad, Homer recruits his two friends, and the school nerd, to build and test rockets. To their surprise, the entire town becomes excited about their project. This is a movie that explains to the viewer that one should follow their heart for what they want to do.  This movie is emotional, both good and bad. I'm sure it won't win any Oscars next year, but it will be remembered as a great movie (like THE NATURAL).  A very entertaining film that is great for the family!",

I do like the name \"October Sky\". Anyway, Jake's performance was his best to date. I have just seen \"Jarhead\" recently and it was awful. But then again, I don't like military films. I think that I'll always like \"October Sky\" unless Jake does a film better than this but I don't know if he could top this film but I don't doubt it.

I gave each of these movies a 9 also: Rocky, Rudy & Hoosiers - all sports movies. Another similar movie was Tucker: A Man And His Dreams. The only problem with it was that it had an unhappy ending.The wonderful thing about October Sky was that it was emotionally uplifting unlike very few films even attempt to be.

Very good set of events and smooth developing of characters as from the old Hollywood school, I would say.

            "review_title": "The backdrop propels this inspiring tale of a kid who followed his passion and the people who helped him achieve it",
            "content": "If I had to define this movie in one word it would be: aspirational. Regardless of whether it sticks to the truth in every single detail of the tale, there's no denying this movie portrays the inspirational story of an underdog kid trapped in a town too small and small-minded for his ground-breaking dream.Maybe it's because, as an engineer from a small town myself, I relate to this sort of tales too closely; but I strongly believe this movie succeeds in what it's trying to say even though it's based in a true story. I'm reluctant to trust all that a biographical picture shows about a historical figure's life, however if it recounted with little changes and it is focused on a positive outcome, I can't help but praise it.Something that caught my attention was that it doesn't idealize neither the negative nor the possitive aspects on such an initiative of the kids. There are folks trying or finding ways to stop them from carrying on or mocking what they are trying to achieve but it never goes too far in terms of stepping out of the realm of the plausible as Hollywood sometimes has. In real life no situation or person is entirely bad or entirely good, we are motivated by our own morals and interests. However, that doesn't mean bad things happen.As you watch the movie it's clear that it's based on a true story because the pacing and unfolding of events feels very \"self-controlled\" in the sense that it never romanticises many of the themes and tropes presented in it. And that only enhances the realism of the story it is trying to tell. But mainly the themes it presents may be its strongest suit. The theme of the father who has lived his whole life in a coal town and can't fathom the idea that his son wants to build rockets and go to space when such a thing was not only possible for a handful of people from probably bigger cities or with better education, but also impossible at the time. I believe the backdrop of the movie and therefore the story, is so inspiring because it was a time were very few believed in the reaches of technology. TV and radio was barely just invented a decade or so ago and it was becoming revolutionary.Surely, if it wasn't based on a true story, I'd find the fact that a coal-miner's son who suddenly develops an interest in rockets and is capable of learning the advance mathematics and be able to achieve what he does in the movie, very hard to believe. But because those aspects of the movie are taken from real life it is way more commendable and trully inspirational. And that's just it, this movie feels unreal for how far kids from a small town go in the space race and all that happens to them, and it makes you wonder why this story hasn't been told before.Additionally, the subplots are not romanticised like other 50s-based movies have because the true story takes center focus. However, the addition of the romantic and other supporting characters subplot provide more layers to the story and emotional weight on many occasions through out the film. Like I said before, regardless of whether those things really happened or not, they enhance the more dramatic or victorious scenes in their own way.But that's the beauty of it, while the dramatic and dream-obstructing scenes weigh down the aspirations of this young kids, these are balanced out by the victory scenes where the inclusion of many of not only the supporting characters but the whole town and other witnesses of the greatness this kids are achieving, elevates the sense of success and inspiration of this moments.IN CONCLUSION, I've tried to keep out of talking about many plotpoints and themes as I believe this are sort of expected from a movie with such a premise but also because I believe it is part of the charm of the movie, the messages it presents in every turn. I may have not being objective when reviewing this title, but that's because as an engineer from a small town in south Spain, I've lived in a town with close-minded people where I had some good but mostly unfortunate moments in my childhood. But I managed to get out of there and find a future for myself, and I don't look back at it with resentment as if I hadn't had the life I had there, well, I wouldn't be were I am now.This movie is deeply inspirational for those who dream of leaving their current life in pursuit of greater things. They don't have to be building the first rocket, becoming president of a country, building the next computer, it need only be a personal dream born from a passion and the perception of the world we live in. It is hard, I know, you may be drawn to believe everything is already invented and everything has already been done, but that doesn't mean you won't find something else on your way. Inspiration and ideas are born from not only what we know but the questions we ask when we know what has already been done. That's how it was done then, reading up books about rocket scientists, and that's how it works now. Know what exists to ask about what doesn't.",

In a way, it might have been a more interesting (but vastly more tragic) movie if Homer and friends had not won at the science fair, and they all ended up working in the mine after all. But this perhaps reinforces my point--for there are no doubt hundreds of failures, in real life, for every Homer Hickam success story.9/10",

The one thing he has going for him is determination.At a gathering to watch Sputnik, he sees that little dot move through the sky and is captivated. He wants to build a rocket and he's going to. That single-minded determination will ensure that happens.I think what's so wonderful about this movie is how things are stacked up against him and it's his will that allows him to succeed.\nHe's not initially smart. he's not into math or science.\nHe's from a family where his destiny seems set -- work in the coal mine with his father.\nThe principal thinks he's a waste of time.\nThe school kids think the rocket thing is a waste of time\nHis dad is dead set against the hobby. Why waste time on that when the coal mine is right next door.One by one, and with the help of some friends, he overcomes the obstacles. And, one by one, the adversaries turn into allies. The kids who ridiculed him start to root for him. the principal who thinks he's a waste now thinks he's got talent. One by one, he wins them over, by his sheer will to succeed with this rocket.Look, I know not everything is as simple as \"follow your dreams and you'll succeed\". But I also know more than a few people who wish for something but don't *want* something. They won't work at it, through good times and bad, day and night, over and over until they succeed. And that's what's so incredibly inspiring about this movie. This kid, with no seeming talent, no innate gift for math or science, had so much determination and will that he succeeded. And, while I'm sure there are some Hollywood liberties made, this is based on a true story, so it's not like this is some fantasy that could never happen.This movie should be required viewing for kids in high school.

The kids were great - even Laura Dern was bearable - and that Chris Cooper can act and has some kinda sex appeal despite the dirt and grime and not-so-pretty face.Again, I saw \"Trainspotting\" four times (bought the soundtrack too!)and I loved this film almost as much.",

Everyone is excellent--so good that it is difficult to point to one star.While there are a few well chosen swear words from Homer's coal miner father, that is all that can be said is not family fare.

Why can't Homer's dad simply accept that his son is different than him? What is his block as a man? This is very true to life stuff. We know the theory of Multiple-Intelligences today. Humility would have given his father this insight--the simple attitude that my son is hardwired differently and embrace his brilliance. His father should have been proud of him, but his shame was too powerful. He tried to conform his son in his own image, and a strong willed boy rebels against this. Life gives another \"parent\" figure (Homer's teacher) as a guide post. The shame Homer's father had is about his own father--pride is rooted somewhere in this story deep inside. Homer's father felt trapped in this mining career, and when he saw his son want to break free, he was gripped with his own fear of leaving; \"I had to stay here, so you should as well!\" \"I didn't get the opportunity, so why should you!\" \"I had to suffer, so you should as well!\" Few men are this aware of honest, but the message is clear.",

Cooper is a miner in a mining town in West Virginia and Gyllenhaal, who plays his son doesn't want to go into the family business. He wants to be a rocket scientist. It's based on a true story. It's no academy award winning movie, but it's very charming and so is Jake Gyllinhall. He's very young in it. The acting by everyone in it is adequate. Everything about it technically is adequate. There's a fun little montage of them shooting, or trying to shoot of their rockets and failing over and over. The sound track was all 60's music which was enjoyable. Although a little predictable and a little derivative it was still pretty entertaining and enjoyable. Maybe because it's just so disgustingly feel good. I cried despite myself at the end. It's also just one of the most family oriented movies ever. If you have the whole family over and don't want to offend anyone, this is the perfect movie for that occasion. There's footage of the real people at the end of the movie. It's pretty fascinating.",

            "content": "If you liked the film Rudy, if Hoosiers made you stand up and cheer, you will love October Sky. Unlike the other two, October Sky is not a sports film. What all three films do have in common is well-told stories of people with dreams who struggle against the odds.The setting for October Sky is a small mining town in West Virginia. In October of 1957 the world learns that the Soviet-made satellite Sputnik has been successfully launched. It is at this point that high-school student Homer Hickam decides to learn all he can about rockets. What begins as a hobby soon becomes an obsession. With the aid of three of his friends, and the encouragement of one of his teachers, Homer learns how to build model rockets.As his passion for the subject develops, Homer senses a life-calling in the making. Unfortunately, Homer lives in one of those towns, where your vocation is determined at birth. Homer's father in particular believes his son is destined to make a living toiling in the coalmines, just like his father. This establishes the central tension in the film, and provides some opportunities for poignant interactions between father and son.This is not a new theme, and the film contains more than a few stock characters. We have already seen the high school teacher played by Laura Dern (think Michelle Pfeiffer in Dangerous Minds or Barbara Hershey in Hoosiers. There is also the high-school principal as uncaring bureaucrat, and a chorus of townsfolk who, at first, remind Homer and the other rocket boys that they should accept their fate in life in the coalmines.In spite of the formulaic nature of the story, this story works. There are enough nuances added that the characters are, at the same time, familiar and new to us. There are no top box-office stars in the film, but there are solid performances by some excellent actors-especially Laura Dern, Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer, and Chris Cooper as Homer's dad.October Sky is based on a true story, and this is part of its power. The image of Homer shooting for the stars while his father dutifully toils in his subterranean world is rich in symbolism. Several years ago, while walking around a Hispanic community on the North side of Chicago, I saw a mural that said, \"there are two things we need to give our children-roots and wings.\" October Sky is about finding that balance. In the beginning of the film, Homer's dad only sees the need for roots, while Homer's thoughts all turn toward flying. Watching the struggle unfold is a richly rewarding experience that the whole family can enjoy.",

I later watched the trailer for it on this site and that alone was enough to move me to own it. This was definitely a great way to launch (no pun intended) Jake Gyllenhaal's career and one of the best movies, if not THE best, that he will have ever done. If you look at Gyllenhaal's profile and click on the genre section, you will see that \"October Sky\" is (so far) the only family work he has ever done. To me that is a sad but true illustration of the choices that some actors and actresses make these days and they should do these more often. The movie doesn't entirely feel like a family movie due to a bit of rough language, so I am taking away two stars.",

But Homer, the one kid who used to be the laughing stock redeems himself by bringing a dying town together on one dream, to go into outer space. Sadly I wish it could be the same for the Space Coast. I wish this movie could bring back the inspiration to these people here. But this movie is at my #1 spot. I don't care how epic \"Transformers Dark of the Moon\" was, or how awesome \"Armageddon\" was, October Sky, the movie that's not epic, the movie, that is my all time favorite.

The cinematogaphy, soundtrack, writing, and characters are all excellent.  This being a true story makes it all the more impressive.  The cast was great even though none are household names.  Not once in the almost two hours did I think of those I was watching as actors.  The story is truly inspirational in that does show what is good about people----hard work, goal setting, persistence, value of family, friendship, and community.  It also emphasizes the value of education.   This is a movie that should be seen by families.

The movie focuses mostly on a high school student in the early 1950's, who lives in a small, poor mining town, trying to pursue a personal interest in model rockets.The story is sweet, uplifting, inspirational, and mostly predictable.  We do know it is based on a true life story after all, and they don't base too many stories on people pursuing an interest and failing horribly.I felt the real focus of the movie was the father, John played by Chris Cooper. He clearly was a \"responsible\" typical middle American person. I think it showed a person struggling with the responsibilities of his job, and his family and trying to make the best choices possible. His job was dangerous, but he was up every day working hard. He tried to channel his son's interests into areas that he (the father) was comfortable with, but the son was resistant to. The movie captures the conflict of a father trying to guide his son, while still allowing him to grow into his own. Ultimately he allows his son some freedom to pursue his own interests, despite the feeling as if his son may be growing apart from him.  In one of the touching moments of the movie, the son lets him know that, that could not happen, when the father says mockingly \"So, you met your hero, and didn't even know it.\" and the son responds \"He is not my hero.\" leaving the implied \"you are\" hanging on the air.",

It makes you feel good for a few reasons: watching a family grow and struggle as they deal with each other's individuality; knowing that sometimes dreams do come true; and that even the most stubborn person can change. Here is a story of a second child who is lost in a family structure that focuses on the accomplishments of the elder sibling and rewards the younger sibling only when he does exactly what is expected of him (no matter how low those expectations may have been.) This is the true story of a young man and his friends who dreamed they could reach the stars (literally) and someday be the people they wanted to be. The story takes place in a small mining town in West Virginia where only a select few of the youth accomplish their goal of leaving the town's borders to follow their dreams. You will follow four of the town's youth as they learn about rockets, science, and life. The film does lack some depth in the area of seeking emotional ties with the audience, but that doesn't really hurt the film, it just doesn't enhance the quality of it. Bottom line...if you like films like \"Rudy\", \"Field of Dreams\", \"Lean on Me\", and \"Stand By Me\" then you should see this one.",

You ARE unselfish, humble, and undeniably deserving of every success.The director skillfully orchestrates an emotionally compelling composition. Most of the acting is understated and inoffensive.  Chris Cooper reprises his life role as a courageous but sensitive man pursued by personal demons. Laura Dern is miscast as the supportive teacher.  Jake Gyllenhaal soldiers through an uninspired performance.  The cinematography and plotting, however, is beyond reproach.  Every incident adds to the dramatic intensity and vividness of the picture.  Even if you don't buy the enraptured faces at times, the landscape, homes, and workplaces ring true.  People do help others out of the goodness of their heart and the film glories in these moments of real personal kindness.If you like Norman Rockwell, are over 50, and were caught up in the space race, see the movie.  Check your cynicism at the door for a pleasant escape to a place that feels real, where good and bad are easily defined, and where all the problems are horrific but manageable.",

One night, the citizens of Coalwood, West Virginia, watch the sky to get a view of the satellite. The event has a significant impact on young Homer Hickam.After seeing Sputnik, Homer becomes fascinated with rockets. He strives to learn everything there is to know about them. Joining forces with three other students, production begins on the first rocket.As time passes, the quartet's prowess in constructing rockets improves, and with the encouragement of teacher Frieda Riley, the boys work hard to earn a chance to go to the National Science Fair in Indianapolis.While Homer and his colleagues develop a popular following, there are some who oppose their work. The biggest critic is Homer's father, John, who is a supervisor at the town's coal mine. His belief is simple: Rockets are a waste of time, and Homer should go to work in the mine, which ultimately becomes the career of virtually all of Coalwood's male citizens. As one of the characters says at one point, it's either the mine, or possibly college thanks to a football scholarship.Since Homer cannot play football, it's either the mine, or rockets. He definitely does not want the first option. What will it be? The film has some solid performances, including Jake Gyllenhall as Homer, and Chris Cooper as John. The script is good, and a lot of the scenes evoke the right emotions. You cannot help but cheer for Homer, who has a dream and wants to achieve it.This film is an uplifting drama, and does show that if you believe, you can follow your dreams. Don't miss it.",

Along the way Homer and his friends must overcome people in town who believe they're lunatics and Homer must overcome his gruff father who shows no proud in Homer but centers it on his brother Jim a football star.

Although this movie takes place some twenty years before I grew up, many of the mores still exist.  For instance, in the 70's and early 80's coal mining was still a dominant market force in southern WV.  Both of my grandfathers were coal miners who worked much of their life underground. Children were primed and expected to work in the mines if they intended to continue to live in southern WV as adults.  This movie strikes an interesting and true-to-life account of a typical southern WV coal mining family.  While watching this movie, I felt transported back to my childhood days, remembering what it was like to wonder if I would be relegated to working in the coal mines.  But, like Homer, I too was able to choose a different path except that I had my father's blessing.  Needless to say, I was moved and touched by this movie, however, I do believe there were great things about growing up in the WV mountains that were not explored in the movie.",

He\u00b4s a more complex (excuse my English) director than it seems, and I feel lucky to know it.

It has something special that also have \"Honey...\", \"Rocketeer\" and \"Jumanji\". Well, I only wish I can go to Anselmo in the future to tell this to Johnston personally.

Maybe even great, but I don't believe that it's one of the greatest family masterpieces it's often made out to be. The story was relatively interesting, starring a young Jake Gyllenhaal as real-life NASA engineer Homer Hickam. After the Soviet satellite Sputnik was sent into space, it instantly caught Hickam's interests and he knew that this was what he was going to do. His family doesn't believe in him, his town doesn't believe in him but one teacher does and it changes his life. I'm sorry, I know this is a true story and all but this movie is very predictable, around the half-way mark you know exactly what's going to happen almost in the order that it ends up doing. That makes the movie feel much longer than it is, probably didn't help that I was also watching it with my family very late at night. They frequently asked me \"how much longer?\" It's by no means a bad movie, not at all. It's average-length but just seems drawn out as the entire story could've easily been told in the span of 10 minutes. Ah, well. Still pretty good family movie, one of the better ones I think I've actually seen and I'd recommend it actually. I liked it, even though a lot of my sleepy siblings didn't. It's quite an inspiring tale of believing in yourself when no one else would but it just falls a little short for my personal tastes. It's still an excellent family movie though.",

In a year with stupid and ugly teen flicks that can only give us cheap jokes, October Sky stood out from the rest. Unfortunately, I did not get to see it in the theater because of commitments. Now I wish I had.October Sky is the true story of Homer Hickam (portrayed by Jake Gyllenhall) who dreams of leaving the dying mining town of Coalwood and doing something other than mining like his father. His father, John (portrayed by Chris Cooper) does not take kindly to this. His father spent all of his life working the mines, and as the movie opens, that life is crumbling around him. Homer is given inspiration when he sees Sputnik orbit over his town and he ends up wanting to become a rocket engineer. He gets a lot of support from his friends, mother, and teacher (played by Laura Dern), but almost no support from his father, who thinks he should take his place in the mines. Homer studies hard to reach his dream, but the pull of his father is strong. Later, he must learn that he must do what he wants to do..The acting in October Sky is top notch. The cast is mostly unknown actors, which I think helps in a movie like this. Gyllenhall did a good job of portraying Homer, who spent a lot of time with the real Homer, who wrote the book that this movie is based on. Chris Cooper is also excellent as Homer's dad, who struggles to keep the life he had for so long. The rest of the cast is strong, and they grow on you.This is a movie with almost no special effects. It has no crude dialogue and it retains old-fashioned values. Those reasons may be a reason why this movie was overlooked by moviegoers. They do not know what they are missing. This movie gets a good emotional response from its viewers without stooping to the cringing level of tearjerker. This movie does not become a tearjerker because it does not need to sink that low. It is just a good, simple story. It is something I wish more movies could achieve. It really recaptures the excitement I had with space flight and rockets when I was a kid.October Sky is one of my three top movies of '99, along with the original The Matrix, and the good old fashioned fun of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. I encourage anyone who actually has a brain to see this movie. Highly Recommended.***** stars (out of *****).",

This film deftly shows us Homer Hickham's painful self-awareness as he tries to show colors to a people relegated to dreaming in black in white.However, this is not a film about drudgery or the downtrodden.  It is one about a town that was willing to believe in its youth, and it provides a valuable lesson for today's \"television-as-babysitter\" world.There are elements of Hickham's book which would have fit nicely within this film's framework.  The value placed on high school football over academics is but one such element, and would have helped to explain the community's mentality a little more clearly.But that is nitpicking, for this is the best of all kinds of movies:  It is one which respects it subject matter, its characters, and how their lives fit in the small frame as well as the big picture.  Kudos to screenwriter Lewis Colick for appreciating Hickam's humor and the dignity of the town's citizenry.  And bravo to director Joe Johnston for instilling this talented cast with a sense of esteem.  The collaborative effort of all involved in this film make it one for the time capsule.  It reminds us who we were, how we got to where we are now, and eventually where we are going.  This film joins Charles Laughton's \"Night of the Hunter\" and John Sayle's \"Matewan\" as accurate portrayals of West Virginia and its denizens.  Without condescension or unqualified judgment, Johnston joins these directors in celebrating a people who are often dismissed as insignificant cogs, but in reality they are the engines who create a prosperity of which they are never allowed to partake.A thought to ponder as in this movie we watch Sputnik streak across the \"October Sky.\"",

I felt nauseated after watching it yesterday after seeing so many recycled Hollywood cliches being used throughout the movie.  Inspiring?  Try watching a movie like \"My Left Foot\" or \"Dead Poets Society\" instead.  The acting was unmoving and two-dimensional, especially Laura Dern's performance.  Chris Cooper pulled in the only semi-believable performance.  It's very poor (not to mention boring) when you are able to predict correctly what each actor is going to say to each other during the last 30 minutes.  One last thing, I thought it was lame how everyone could see the rocket launch into the sky at the end of the movie (including a conveniently placed window in Laura Dern's hospital room).  Save your money folks--it's definitely not worth it, not even on video. 1 out of 10",

With his father's pleads to accept his future in the mining society, Homer does everything he can to follow his dream. He gets the help of his classmates, teacher, and other town members and goes on to win the national science fair competition and many scholarship offers, which eventually lead him to work at NASA.This movie should inspire all who watch to follow their dreams, even if it seems like the whole world is against you. It also shows that you can overcome any challenge life throws at you and to trust and believe in yourself.The cast in the movie, to me, were all pretty amazing.

            "content": "October Sky is an inspirational movie of a young boy and his friends who are passionate about their dream of making rockets at a time when the Russians had just launched Sputnik. It is about perseverance of a boy in the midst of all adversities, misunderstandings, hardships and challenges. His desire to pursue what his real calling is and realise it. It is about inspiration and courage.Initially not a very bright student, his new born passion of building rockets sees him take on subjects that weren't his cup of tea (maths and calculations). When faced with lack of financial resources, he along with his friends take up to stealing old unused railway tracks. (That scene where they have just unlinked a rail from an unused track - or so they thought - and then they hear the train coming, is quite hilarious!)The most poignant part of the movie is his strained relationship with his father who wants to see him take over his job as supervisor in a coal mine and thinks his running after rockets is a waste of time. In spite of the animosity and difference of opinion, Homer acknowledges to his father that he is his real hero. At the end, his father understands him and appreciates his talent.The friendship among the four of them, each one of a different kind, is quite warming. All driven by the passion to build rockets together. Thus they earn the name 'Rocket Boys'. The role and inspiration of their teacher Miss Riley too is aptly portrayed... her desire to see them go to college and become someone in life!Worth watching it every now and then! http://vcastilino.blogspot.in/",

            "content": "** This is my homework** October Sky, a film woven by the odds between father and son, and the dream of living oneself's life. Homer Hickam, the protagonist of the film, had an 'impossible' dream since he witnessed the launch of the first man-made satellite. Because of this dream, he befriended with the weird yet smart geek Quentin, and started the journey of rocket making with Quentin, Roy Lee and O'Dell. In Coalwood, high school graduates usually could not further their study in college, the only opportunity going to college is getting the football scholarship. But Homer did not surrender to his fate of being a coal miner. Of course,Homer's father, who was the leader of the coal miner and expected his son will be a coal miner, did not support him making rockets.There were many obstacles on the road of Homer's goal, he and his friends was accused as arsonists as they could not find all their rockets back, therefore, he was suspended. During that period, his father was injured as he tried to save the miners in an accident. The family could not afford the charge of surgery, so that Homer decided to work as a coal miner to provide for his family instead of his brother, who got the football scholarship, and would not be able to go to college if he dropped out at that moment. I think it is very responsible of Homer to prioritize his family , yet, it is upset to see him giving up his dream. There is a scene where they ignited the gasoline bomb and hurled it into the hut on there experiment site, it symbolizes the end of their dream.'Sometimes you really can't listen to what anybody else says, you just gotta listen inside.' The words of Miss Riley evoked Home's enthusiasm of rocketry and the passion buried deep inside the heart of the audience as well. I as an audience member, instantly asked my self, ' what's my inside voice's telling me? What do I want to achieve?' Similar to Homer, my school does not produce many graduates who can go to university, but I will not be tied and I know I will and have to outshine others so that I will have the chance to further my study in University and that I can fight against the fate I should supposedly live.Homer was determined to devote in rocketry after being inspired by Miss Riley. He studied very advance Mathematics twenty-four-seven, at lunch time in coal mine, at night on bed. He eventually figured out that the fire was not started by their rockets, they were not related to the arson! This is the twist I love most, as when I was watching the movie, I felt like I was walking in Homer's shoes. It gives me strength to move on. Finally, the Rocket Boys got the champion of the county science fair, both four of them got the scholarships to go to college. Still, they are proving nothing to others, they are just being themselves, whom they knew do not belong here or work in coal mines.Along the plot of Homer chasing his dream, there is another line of plot of the father-and-son odds. 'Father love the mines more than Jim, even more than you!' Homer groaned to his mother. Because of the pride of his father, he did not want his son to see coal miner as a not so classy job and expected his second son to be like him, a coal miner. 'Coal mine is your life, it's not mine. I'm never going down there again.' Homer confronted his dad, I believe his dad must be broken hearted at that time. It was harsh for Homer to say things like that, but I figure telling the true feeling would be better. After Homer came back from the science fair, there is a scene where Homer showing his medal while his father going down the mine elevator, we can see the eyes of Homer's father, the way he looked at his son, he was proud of his son. Homer was also jealous of his brother, as his dad never missed a game of his brother, but he had never come to watch him launching the rockets. In the very end, Homer's father was there to launch the rockets, the smile on Homer was sweeter than you have ever seen. This also credits to the actors, they did an incredible job on playing the roles. I have already expressed my appreciation to this superb film, another fact that impressed me most is that this film is base on a true story. I do not see why you and I cannot be the next Homer Hickam! What's your inside voice telling you?",

Chris Cooper (\"Lone Star\") plays the dad, Natalie Canerday (\"Sling Blade\") plays Homer's mom and Laura Dern is a caring teacher. Inspired by the sight of Sputnik racing across the night sky, Homer begins building home-made rockets, writing to Werner Von Braun and defying his father, who wants him to give up such foolishness and focus on a real working-man's career.

The character development was wonderful, and I felt that it was meshed in properly to a story that had such a heavy amount of plot to get through.  Perhaps full explanations for certain relationships and so on were negated, but I felt this was necessary in order to keep the focus on the main theme.  I utterly adored this film, and would recommend it to anyone. It was easily among the best five films made during last year's Oscar season. Why the Academy didn't see this is beyond me.

Leaving what's old and heartless behind.  With a title like \"October Sky,\" should that come as a surprise?  Thomas Wolfe would be proud.\nThe feelings Joe Johnston elicits aren't artificially affected and that's what those nay-sayers have a problem with - they actually do feel a sense of humanity while watching this.  Even for me (a film fanatic), it came as a surprise what this film contained:  good script, great acting, beautiful cinematography (from the Charles Sheeler opening montage to the Conrad Hall inspired scene with the rain-on-the-windowpane-symbolizing-pain from In Cold Blood).  It's intentionally and successfully moving.So for those who grew up in dying rural America or for those who ever had a dream that others scorned or for those who ever had a beating heart, I recommend this movie highly.  Much like The Last Picture Show, it deals with coming-of-age in a dying setting, but unlike Bogdanovich's film, it doesn't leave you cold in the end - it makes you feel ALIVE.",

            "content": "OCTOBER SKY ****1/2 (out of 5 Stars) Starring-Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper, Laura Dern and Chris Owen; Director-Joe JohnstonEveryone I talked to loved Patch Adams, and yet the critics completely lambasted it. Here is a movie that I'm sure the movie-going public and professional critics can agree on. They're saying that October Sky is the first great movie of 1999, and they're right.This is the true story of Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), a young boy in a small West Virginia coal mining town who is obsessed with building a working rocket. His influence is the Russian satellite Sputnik, a landmark achievement that he sees pass, consequently, in the October night sky. His father (played by Chris Cooper), driven by generations of coal miners in the family, views Homer's rocket chemistry as nonsensical and wants him to follow in his footsteps. The only support Homer gets is from his friends and his teacher, Miss Riley (Laura Dern), who eagerly assists him as his dream unravels.Joe Johnston manages to press all the right buttons that a director possibly could, turning this basic formula movie into an uplifting, heartwarming piece of modern day entertainment. It's absolutely no surprise that the movie is produced by the same people as Field of Dreams. It's that good.October Sky could have easily failed if everything didn't click appropriately. The first mission was to get a believable actor to play Homer, the young real-life hero who now works at NASA. This is where the filmmakers struck gold. In casting newcomer Jake Gyllenhaal as the teenager brave enough to follow his dream, Johnston made the best decision of his career. Young Gyllenhaal is a sensational find, and the movie simply glows whenever he's on camera. This puts everything to rest, because he's in nearly every scene in the film.Another wise move was to put Homer's rocky relationship with his father ahead of even its main story. Cooper has a familiar role and speaks familiar dialogue, but his situation is so believable that all signs of deja vu are quickly pushed aside. Laura Dern is also playing somewhat of a stock character. Her role may be the one weak spot the film has, but in the same sense she performs very well with the material she's given. Everyone involved deserves a pat on the back for making this movie.There's truly never an uninvolving moment in this two-hour gem, which has far more than the designated amount of laughs and smiles needed to register. If you're looking for something entertaining, you couldn't do much better than seeing this. October Sky is the best movie Hollywood has presented so far this year.",

October Sky is a great depiction of exactly what it was like to have the big world pressing around you, but still be caught up in the little things of a very ordinary life.

The music is marvelous.  And the humor is fitted in just the right spots so that it will make you laugh and cry at the same time.  But what I like most about this movie is the fact that teenagers are portrayed not as screw-ups, not as misfits, not as delinquents, but as instruments of hopes and dreams.  The kids in \"October Sky\" aren't senseless failures.  They are responsible young adults who have potential and strive to use it.  I think it's about time we had a movie like that. But of course \"Sky\" is not perfect.  One distinct aspect is how the movie tends to leave you clueless to some events. Also, since the movie is relatively dark and there is so much dirt on the miners' faces, it's almost impossible to tell who's who (And that gets downright annoying when a certain individual dies). But overall, \"October Sky\" is a blast.  I recommend it to anyone who's willing to sit down for an hour and fifty minutes of warm fuzzies.  And I mean that in a good way.",

Yes, it shows kids the upside to school, to science and math, and to following your dreams for what you want to be when you grow up.  But this movie, as anyone who sees it knows, has more than that one storyline.  There is the classic coming-of-age side to it where we see four friends finding out who they are and what they are passionate about.  We see one of them defying his father who seems to be heartless, but who later comes to the rescue of another one of the boys.  And we also see a true life account of one of the most remembered parts of our nation's history--the beginning of the Space Race.  The film opens with Sputnik being launched and seen flying through space over the small town in which the characters live.  From there, one boy gets an idea to build a rocket, and soon his two best friends and their brainy classmate join him.  We follow them through their greatest achievements and their lowest times.  And in the end, we see where their desire to learn and passion for knowledge take them. This movie is an absolute 10 out of 10 for me.  If you haven't seen it, go rent it.

So I'll tell you what I didn't like.It seems to me as if the director/writer tried to make every moment soak with emotion and sentiment.  This might be good, but it also makes it a little sappy and terribly predictable.  At one point, I predicated word for word what the next lines were going to be. That's pretty bad.In fact, October Sky is so busy trying to be inspiring that it acts like we already know the story.  For example, why does Homer all of the sudden like rockets?  Ok, so he saw Sputnik float across the sky.  But so did everyone else.  We never really find out exactly what his passion is with the sky. He looks up at space only three times in the entire movie.  Anytime we have as dedicated and committed a character as Homer, we need to know why he is as dedicated and committed(Contact does a fantastic job of this).Other questions:  why is the principal so biased against Homer's rocketry? No one else in the town, save Homer's dad, is.  And for some reason, after Homer sits down with Quentin, Quentin becomes everyone's best friend.  Why? Homer isn't THAT cool in school.October Sky is a great family movie for families.  It's nice to see brains triumph over brawn.  But I really wish they would've spent more time on the lure and the magic of space.  Otherwise, rocketry might as well have been bridge building or car building.",

I also liked the character of Hickham's father, who set high standards for his sons, but I don't think any hiugher than the standards he set for himself.

Homer struggles to overcome the suffocating future that has been laid out for him in a 1950's coal mining town by reaching for the sky with his toy rockets.

            "content": "October Sky is a highly lauded movie, and it\u00a1\u00a6s easy to see why. The story is easy to comprehend and many turning points are gripping, the actors and actresses do fairly good jobs, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper, the hero finally gets what he wants, and it\u00a1\u00a6s a true story. Frankly I think the director\u00a1\u00a6s achievement is not comparable to the sparks and heat the original story generates. We don\u00a1\u00a6t see any special narrative or cinematography; the power of the movie relies much on the riveting plot and tough situation the young hero is trapped in that most audience will find themselves identify with the characters. We feel Homer\u00a1\u00a6s desire to earn his father\u00a1\u00a6s recognition and create his own future, and his resilience wins our respect. \u00a1\u00a7October Sky\u00a1\u00a8 reminds me of a later 2001 Japanese production of mini series \u00a1\u00a7Rocket Boy,\u00a1\u00a8 which might owe some of the inspiration from this movie. Actually these two works shot from two different cultures provide interesting comparison. When October Sky unfolds a story of a young man crying out loud to claim his right over his own destiny, \u00a1\u00a7Rocket Boy\u00a1\u00a8 offers a more compromised description that could sometimes constitute an acrid criticism of modern society. Starring the outstanding actor Yuji Oda, \u00a1\u00a7Rocket Boy\u00a1\u00a8 focuses on three men as ordinary as can be: a travel agent who has a dream of becoming an astronaut, a boastful advertising agent who is on the brink of being torn apart by his inferiority complex resulted from the extreme success of his father and older brother (like what Homer feels in his family), and a food company employee who is about to getting married but scared of this idea. The collected social consciousness superimposes its definition of success on its constituents and steps further to force them suffocate their dreams by claiming them \u00a1\u00a7impossible.\u00a1\u00a8 To compensate for his lost ideal, Kobayashi (Yuji) works in the tour operator because it\u00a1\u00a6s called \u00a1\u00a7Galaxy.\u00a1\u00a8 When his client fails him and his girlfriend decides to leave him, he finally finds strength from his father\u00a1\u00a6s words, who had determined to be a sailor but later found life on the sea less attractive as he had presumed. \u00a1\u00a7But I don\u00a1\u00a6t regret it,\u00a1\u00a8 his father told Kobayashi, \u00a1\u00a7at least I tried.\u00a1\u00a8 It is his father\u00a1\u00a6s confession that encourages him to resign his job and apply for astronautships despite the fact that he hurts his legs and needs to move around on a wheelchair. Kobayashi\u00a1\u00a6s effort finally fails, and he goes back to the travel agency. But his \u00a1\u00a7crazy\u00a1\u00a8 courage inspires his friends, and everyone loves him more. Just before the end of the series, Kobayashi is on the job as a guide of a space camp meant to let children learn more about astronauts. After the tour is over we see him leaning against a tree, unfolding a sheet of poster he tears from the bulletin board that says: \u00a1\u00a7Astronauts Wanted for 2004.\u00a1\u00a8 Kobayashi looks at the piece of paper and laughs and laughs, just like a kid looking at his ticket to Disneyland. Kobayashi may never get what he wants, but he dares his destiny and \u00a1\u00a7just does it.\u00a1\u00a8 This series is so heart-gripping not because the hero exhibits any heroic deeds, but his ordinariness and unstoppable urge to realize his dream which make us wonder and envy. Unlike Dilbert or other sarcastic writings, this show enlightens us and teaches us something. Homer and Kobayashi both have the dream, and they do what they can despite other people\u00a1\u00a6s opinions. I recommend other IMDB users to see the Japanese TV series. If you are a nine-to-fiver, you will feel more touched. I feel sorry that IMDB doesn\u00a1\u00a6t have its data, maybe you can ask somebody from Japan to help you.",

In this day in age of your \"American Pie\", \"Varsity Blues\", \"Porkys\", and just basically all of the teenie bopper films out there. I was happy to see a film that dug deep into the lives of 4 boys who used intellegence and a captivating story line, to make this film good. Unlike most films that have to do with high school, this film didn't bother with popularity and sex. It dealt with the life of Homer Hickam who wanted to make something of his life, and his inspiration was the sattelite sputnik. He got together a team of 4 boys who as well were interested in this feat, and nothing but controversy followed. Everyone in Homers town of Coalwood, usually would go work down in the coal mines and that was that. Even the school principle did not even believe in the value of an education, he sent kids out of school and into the coal mines, and he considered it an honorable trade. Ms. Riley did a great job of keeping these boys dreams alive. What I also loved about this film, is that they didn't completely dwell on one story. They didn't just dwell on the story of Homer and his dad. They incorporated so many other stories in the process that you had to follow. The high point in this film for me, had to be when Homer proved that his rocket did not make that forest fire, and he got up on the chalkboard and used Trigonometry to prove his theory. Most people would have scuffed this idea or at least laughed at it, but people liked it and were happy to see that a film about 4 high school boys used intellegence and not sex. What I didn't like too much about this film though was that it was predictable. I think that in order to make a good film that is predictable, you need a great and captivating story line that you can just get lost in. This film accomplished that well and a good example of that is the film E.T. which had a great story line but was very predictable. This is a great film, and reccomended for anyone who is sick of films like \"Varsity Blues\" and \"American Pie\".",

Laura Dern puts in a moving performance and Chris Cooper plays the disapproving father very well as he went on to do in American Beauty (1999).

I was reluctant to see this film (I only decided to see it because \"Life Is Beautiful\" was sold out) because it really looked like a \"ho-hum\" movie, ya know what I mean?But instead what I got out of it was not at all what I expected!  I would be not be telling the truth if I said \"October Sky\" was not slow-moving at times.  But that didn't matter.  This movie is filled with so much genuine emotion, and Homer's struggles with his father really hit close to home.It's a true sign of a good movie when the audience actually claps and does not leave during the credits.  This movie got me all choked up, and it made me cry!  Yes, I'm a guy, and yes, I cried for this movie.  I'm not even sure what I was crying FOR.  The movie is not EXTREMELY sad, but it's just such a mass of emotions, I didn't know what to do with them.  It actually hit me the most AFTER the movie, during the credits.  Everything sort of sunk in at once and it just got to me.  I didn't want to walk out and have people see me!If a movie moves me to laughter, moves me to tears, moves me to whatever -- then it has done what I wanted it to do.  And that makes the $7.00 admission price worth it.  \"October Sky\" IS that movie.  It IS worth it.  Please go see it.  You will not regret it.",

But hey, there's always room for a well-played and well-written one. On more than one occasion did I feel my throat clutter up and my eyes go all stingy-like.We like seeing people overcoming personal and practical obstacles and succeeding at what they dream of. And it's also refreshing to see one which is n-o-t about the high school football/baseball-team that's at the bottom of the series inching their way up to the final - and guess what - winning it.Having just seen Jake Gyllenhaal in \"Donnie Darko\" and being blown away by his performance there, I was even more so after seeing this flick. He is a very talented young actor. A word of caution though, Jake. Please embark on more projects like \"Donnie Darko\" or you might become your generations Tom Hanks. Hate to see yet another great talent loose itself within the boundaries of \"happy-ending-land\".Chris Cooper does a very good job portraying Jakes father, but he is so typecast in that role that certain scenes almost becomes comical. Damn you Hollywood-people for not allowing actors to grow. Damn you.All in all, a very enjoyable film. A bit too much in the end though when he proves himself to the mining-community, reconciles with his father, realizes which girl he wants (and getting her) AND getting a scholarship. Felt a bit like the ending to the first \"Karate Kid\"-movie, if y'know what I mean.7/10",

            "content": "When I saw this movie, it had quite a large emotional impact on me. I realize that many people probably didn't notice it very much. I certainly haven't read all the reviews on here, but I understand where they're all coming from.I saw October Sky several years back when I was in high school, between 1999 and 2001. I've always been one of the better students at math and physics and such. Normally, you would think that a movie like this should appeal to me heavily. I've always loved space travel, whether it's Star Trek, or coming up with my own quirky ideas for science fiction and such.If I recall, the movie was shown one afternoon to 20 or 30 students who were involved in many different things, not simply those steeped in chemistry, etc. The idea wasn't to have us focus on the rocketry plot as much as the simple idea of motivation, to help us follow our dreams and reach beyond ourselves and pursue lofty goals.If I had seen the movie a few years earlier, it probably would have hit me fairly hard on that facet. However, by the time I saw it I was already well-directed in my own life. I had a pretty good idea where I was going. No, for me, the impact came much differently.I've skimmed about 80 of the 290 reviews on here and have only found the love story subplot mentioned twice, wherein it was simply referred to as being worthless or useless in the story. I understand where you're coming from. It's too clich\u00e9, too alike every other movie out there. But so what? If it's true, it's true. Why doesn't it deserve inclusion?In 1998 I fell in love with a girl named Dorothy. For some time she meant the world to me. Eventually, I realized our relationship wasn't going to work out. She ended up getting married in 2003 to another guy. Nevertheless, October Sky had a strong personal impact on me at the time. \"Dorothy\" was the name of the girl in the movie that Homer had his crush on. When the first scenes of the two of them came on in the movie, I couldn't help but put myself in Homer's place. If I remember, the room where I watched the movie had the lights out, but all someone would have had to do was look in my direction to see the bright red glow on my face. On the screen, everything seemed to speak to me personally and my own life. At the time I still hoped things between me and my Dorothy could work out. The movie made me consider more and more my own situation. Everything just seemed so parallel. I wondered, in fact, if someone had purposely shown the movie to see how reacted\u0097who knows, God, or a guardian angel, I don't know.So they fired off rockets. Our characters needed to find where one of the stray rockets had gone, so they used trig and scouted out through a forest until they found the thing. Cool stuff. I've always loved electronics, fuels, and all those nifty things. Eventually, Homer achieved his dream, becoming prominent in the aerospace movement. A new girl came along in the meantime. Did she really fill that void left by Dorothy? Who can say?October Sky was a good movie. While I can't downplay the importance of following your dream and achieving your goals, of research and study and sticking with something that's important; while October Sky was a meal on my journey that has helped motivate me to reach my own dreams in writing and doing some of the most important things in my own life, I can't deny that the more important place it held for me was offering me a strange and sad look at a girl that I loved.So, while some of you will undoubtedly continue to call the \"minor\" love story \"trite,\" \"clich\u00e9,\" \"not crucial to the main drama,\" etc, from my own perspective I would call your attention to the likely fact that Homer H. Hickam Jr. included that \"sub-plot\" for some reason, perhaps because it was important to him and had things not occurred as they did, his life would have been far, far different. Don't completely discount something without taking a deeper look.",

            "content": "Having a dream is normal and that is part of human behavioral science. I always felt that western societies are receptive and children have a freeway in searching and seeking their career path. This film was an eye -opener, that all societies mirror each other with slight differential. Further, it was revelation that your dormant mind dream can trigger with a slight spark. That spark was 'Sputnik 1' circumnavigating miles away in the orbit following its own trajectory. It is an old age tradition that children follow their parental profession. The parents lay the groundwork so that the children do least struggle, as it is a well-scripted route. Therefore, Homer's father was no exception. He prided his profession and earned the respect of his peers, sub-ordinates and management not a normal feat given the circumstance of the terrain he is working (coalmines). Any accomplishment is impossible without a stable schooling supported by enthusiastic teachers who make the student learn (Ms. Freida J. Riley). Childhood friends though having distinct mindsets but helping the crucial purpose (Rocket boys) and of course the society, that inhabits us. Their support system permeates allowing impossible tasks to be within our grasps just by perseverance. Except his father always, the small town people cheered him at each unsuccessful rocket launch. What really moved me was pain portrayed by Father and Son. They both have strong conviction and unable to convince each other. Their love distilled and filtered through the loving and caring wife/mother trying to mend each other to keep her family knitted. After winning, the competition when Snr Hickam taunts that he was unable to recognize even his idol Wernher von Braun (scientist). The reply given was very emotional explaining to his father that he wants to be a good human like him and though Mr. Braun is indisputably a great scientist but he is not his idol. In a very subtle message, he conveyed whom he wants to emulate in life. Father pressing the button for the final rocket launch was the icing that success with effort and pain is worth only with family, friends and society. This real life story teaches us some vital lessons for life. We should be affirmative in want we need in life. Our life circumstances provides us tussle that make us withdrawn in what you need most. We need to change those failures into opportunities and take 'baby steps'. Age should never be a factorial probably everyone can never be as blessed as 'Homer Hickam' but gets closer to your dream.",

            "content": "I had an opportunity to watch the DVD of October Sky (Universal, 1999) and came away somewhat disappointed.  I should note that I avoided the movie when it was out in general release for many of the same reasons I waited until now to review it.  From all reports, the story of a 1957 West Virginia high school students experimenting with rockets that subsequently changed their lives seemed laden with the heavy hand of \"individual triumphs over group expectations\" cliche common to these coming-of-age genre pictures.Based on a true story, the film stars Jake Gyllenhaal as the high school student Homer Hickham, an actual person who currently works at NASA on the space shuttle program.  We join the film as the Soviet Union has just launched Sputnik and the radio and television reports are buzzing about the meaning of this technological triumph.At first, Homer and most of his classmates are seemingly non-plussed about the event.  This apparent reason for the lack of interest is that they are all trapped in a coal mining town, with all the property (including the school and everyone's homes) owned by an unnamed conglomerate.  Mentions of the \"company store\" abound throughout the movie.  The \"company\" is represented by Homer's father (Chris Cooper), who manages the local mining operation.West Virginia is painted as a place of unremitting gloom.  The weather alternates between heavy downpours of rain to overcast conditions.  One who has never been to West Virginia would be surprised to learn that the state enjoys occasional sunny days.  It is notable the only clear sky that appears comes during the one night when Homer glances above to see Sputnik flying overhead.  All of a sudden, Homer's future life course is set.The supposedly transforming experience of seeing Sputnik overhead does not ring genuine and the credibility problem for the movie begins here. Although depicted as a 1950s teenager, Gyllenhaal initially comes across as a prototypical 1990s slacker.  As his teacher Miss Reilly (portrayed by Laura Dern) notes, Homer doesn't even like math.Homer soon starts the arduous process of putting together a winning entry for the area science fair.  In doing so, Homer taps two of his friends, played by William Lee Scott and Chad Lindberg and he then befriends the class nerd, played by Chris Owen.  Thus the \"Rocket Boys\" (the name of the book the movie adapts) are set.   The boys then enlist the covert assistance of a company welder and a black miner with knowledge of metallurgy (surprisingly, the film does not touch on the race of the miner despite the era) in the process of constructing their craft.Laura Dern appears as Miss Reilly, the teacher who inspired the real Homer Hickham to follow his dreams.  As the teacher, Dern's performance is etched with firm earnestness.  She wants these boys to dream despite their circumstances and, for the most part, she manages to overcome the character's earnest nobility and provide a credible performance.The movie proceeds headlong into a series of setbacks and hairpin plot turns.  Events drive the movie forward, not the characters.  The themes are persistently the same; opposition to the endeavor emerges from the authority figures and then being countered by the determined efforts of the Rocket Boys and their allies.  A scene at the national science fare where the demonstration materials are stolen is typical.  The theft leads to a plea to the community that resolves a United Mine Worker's strike which in turn leads to the replacement materials being delivered right in the nick of time.  It's one of the \"oh, come on\" moments that appear frequently in the film.As the lead, Jake Gyllenhaal spends most of his time trying to find his rhythm.  Chris Owen as the standard-issue school nerd doesn't manage to rise above the stereotype.  Rocket Boy Chad Lindberg manages to blend so effectively into the background that it's difficult to remember his performance.There are some good performances that rise above the material.  In addition to the above mentioned Laura Dern, Chris Cooper, portraying the tough father with a heart of gold, becomes the soul of the movie.  Natalie Canerday as Homer's mom likewise grabs the viewer's attention with the quiet strength of her character as well as the clarity of her voice.  Rocket Boy William Lee Scott (currently featured in \"Pearl Harbor\") stands out from his group through a very subtle and stoic performance.  A scene with Cooper and Scott and their encounter with the boy's abusive stepfather is brief, but is perhaps the most memorable part of the movie.The heavy-handedness of the period costumes, props and music (played loudly at every turn) is unrelenting.  These items can be effective to set an appropriate time and place, but they instead overwhelm the momentum whenever they appear.\"October Sky\" is in large part a roller coaster ride of events.  While the film attempts to be a demonstration of the nobility of youthful spirit, it's focus on incidents and repetition of themes leave the characters with little room to grow and develop.",

The movie is set in Coalwood, a mining town where it is predetermined that you are going to be a coal-miner when you grow up unless you are one of the lucky ones who got out on a football scholarship.  Miss Riley, Homer's optimistic teacher pushes him along and goes against the principal by \"believing in the unlucky ones.\"This wasn't a spectacular movie, but it was an interesting story and it is a nice change from the high-budget movies.  The movie was entertaining for the most part, but I looked down at my watch an hour into the movie and thought that over an hour and a half had passed.  Although to me it seemed the movie moved slowly, it was an enjoyable movie and it was fun to watch Homer and his three friends on their quest to build a rocket.  It may just be that I see where he is coming from, myself building rockets, but I liked watching as the rockets progressed and became more and more stable.

I should point out that it's the ONLY school on Earth where your teachers all had PHD's, and several of them wrote our textbooks. Dr. Von Braun lectured at many colleges, but only at ONE high school, mine. Newsweek's cover story in May, 2008 listed the BEST high schools in America. They had 100 schools listed, plus the Elite School List. Number ONE on the Elite list was Stuyvesant, and they said, \"Open Enrollment, BUT requires a VERY stringent Entrance Exam!\". As for the movie, it's a true story, beginning with the launching of Sputnik, the first satellite, and because we were mired in the Cold War, we were extremely jealous of the Russians. \"The Right Stuff\", a movie about OUR space program, had the line, \"Our Germans are better than their Germans!\" History has proven them not only correct, but prescient as well. Bottom line, I really enjoyed this movie. Having seen Jake Gyllenhaal in several other movies, I was pleasantly surprised at just how good he was as a teenager. The pivotal role was played by Laura Dern as a high school teacher who encouraged Jake/Homer to pursue his dream of being a Rocket Scientist. Turns out the real Homer Hickam became one of NASA*s top scientists, and was part of the team that sent Apollo Eleven to the Moon. If you have a chance to see it, please do. You won't be disappointed. BTW, my license plate reads DRBHAPPY.",

            "content": "I guess the first thing I would say about this film is that it really brought me back to my own childhood as I watched the plot unravel in the theatre. I grew up in the sixties and seventies, in Virginia, but I remember going to West VA in the sixties and the feel that the place had (the poverty, the rusted old cars in the woods, etc.). I could relate to Homer Hickam, Jr. because I used to launch and design model rockets as a kid and in high school one of my idols was Mr. von Braun. I also liked the acting of Mr. Cooper as the father--but I kept expecting him to reach out and hit his son and was surprised when he never did. The home movie clips at the end of the film were excellent! I am now going to go out and read the book \"Rocket Boys.\" My only gripes are minor: Why was the teacher's illness sort of casually tossed into the film (or edited down)? I felt more could have been explained here. Also: I was not alive in the fifties, but from what I know of the region (Southern West VA), it seems the soundtrack could have included more hillbilly music, more country/western in it. I know kids had AM radios that would pick up powerful signals at night back then from far away stations (like in Chicago or Buffalo) that would play more R&B and Rock 'n roll, but leaving out all of the country or gospel or hillbilly music took away some of the regional feel in the film. For instance, you could have included George Jones' song \"White Lightning\" for the scene where the boys get the alcohol from the guy with the still. Or some Patsy Cline could have been mixed in, along with the Elvis and Buddy Holly. These are minor gripes though. The film was very very powerful and I am recommending it to all of my friends.",

Great, great movie.The main criticisms I have read in regards to the movie have been its excessive use of cliches, its predictability, and its sentimentality. However, I think all of them are unwarranted. First off, it's a cliche only when it's handled as such. I don't think any of the elements in the film (particularly the father played so well by Chris Cooper, who deserves an Oscar dammit!) were done in a cliche way. As for it being predictable, it's a true story--I don't know how one could avoid not being predictable. Anyways, predictability in of itself is hardly bad. If it is, then no one should ever see a movie for the second time, since we know what's going to happen. Lastly, people seem to confuse emotionality with sentimentality. Just because people may cry in a movie, it doesn't make the film sentimental. One of the great things about October Sky is its lack of excess fat--this is one lean, mean movie, clocking in at one hour and forty minutes, although the film is very much an epic. This is in contrast to other \"sentimental\" films--like Good Will Hunting, Patch Adams, As Good As It Gets, Titanic (although I love Titanic too)--that go well beyond the two hour limit with little of the story elements that October Sky crams in.",

And October Sky prevents these familiar archetypes from going down that route by imbuing them with respect and dignity.There's the class beauty who possesses a genuine interest in rocketry and is just as determined to leave the small town, but does not fully grasp the power she holds over the boy who likes her. There's the housewife who shows how you can hate a person, while maintaining one's love for him. There's the geek who is disliked by others not because of his academic aptitude, but because he lacks the social graces of others--but for him, that's the only way for him to succeed. There's the stuffy principle whose realist attitudes can be swayed when he sees an actual chance of hope being fulfilled. There's the inspirational teacher who is so determined to complete her destiny before it's too late that she walks away from a student in his greatest hour of need. And then there's the hardheaded and apathetic father who demonstrates the possibility that one can be both antagonist and protagonist all at the same time.It's to director Joe Johnston's credit that the film continually rings true when we have seen everything before. Johnston and screenwriter Lewis Colick do not provide any villains in the film because they truly get human behaviour--every questionable deed is given a motivation that allows the audience not to justify it per se, but to at least understand it. Even the abusive, drunken stepfather is included into this description. Such a compassionate view of humanity can hardly be considered a cliche, since it's employed so rarely in cinema.How someone can deride this film on the basis of its supposed cliches, and then prop up Dead Poets' Society, is beyond me. Perhaps Laura Dern could have fleshed out her teacher character more by making a couple celebrity impersonations? I love this movie--the best film of the year thus far. A ten.",

They should at least follow it up with percentages. Is it 10% true? 20%?, 80%? For crying out loud, how true is it?October Sky takes place in a dreary and dying coal-mining town. It's 1957, in a town named Cattlewood, West Virginia. The inspiration for this film is from a moment in history.On October 4th, 1957 the town of Cattlewood's eyes were fixated on the night sky. We see a single point of light that looks like a traveling star moving across space, as the other stars remain stationary. It is the Russian satellite, Sputnik.Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), a high school student realizes, after witnessing the historical event, that his goal in life is to build rockets. He has to overcome the standard movie obstacles:1)The angry hardened father who is the coalmine supervisor.2)The police that wrongfully accuse him of causing a major forest fire from one of his test rockets.3)Forced to drop out of school to work in the mines, etc. (\"I'll be Back\")4)The principal (Chris Ellis) is against me.5)Family dilemmas: Mother support = yes (Natalie Canerday), School teacher inspiration = yes (Laura Dern), Father support = no (Chris Cooper), Older brother assistance = no (Scott Thomas), Fellow students and town = no then yes (Remaining cast), Total = ?Miss Riley (Laura Dern) successfully convinces Homer and his three friends that they should enter their rocket into the National Science fair.

When the chips were down and the family was in trouble because his father had been injured in a mine accident, he stepped in.  He could have allowed his brother to drop out of school and work in the mine because he was the oldest and stronger than his younger brother.

            "content": "Based on the memoir Rocket Boys by Homer H. Hickam Jr., October Sky emerged as one of the most delightful sleepers of 1999--a small miracle of good ol' fashioned movie-making in the cynical, often numbingly trendy Hollywood of the late 20th century. Hickam's true story begins in 1957 with Russia's historic launch of the Sputnik satellite, and while Homer (played with smart idealism by Jake Gyllenhaal) sees Sputnik as his cue to pursue a fascination with rocketry.\nComparisons to \"Stand by Me\" are unavoidable, since \"October Sky\" has a small-town intimacy, a group of close-knit pals and the kind of innocence seldom found on screen these days. What it also has is a predictable trajectory that works against such appealing simplicity. As adapted by Lewis Colick, the screenplay shifts busily among the boys' rocket exploits, Homer's family, conditions at the mine and the influence of a dedicated science teacher (Laura Dern), but each of these subplots plays out in familiar ways.The film watches Homer progress from accidentally blowing a hole in the family's white picket fence, which virtually adjoins the mine, to learning how to make a rocket soar. With the aid of his closest buddies (Chris Owen, William Lee Scott and Chad Lindberg), Homer draws on limited local resources for his rocketry experiments. Since this means commandeering metal from railroad tracks and visiting a still for 100-proof rocket fuel, the story has its playful side.\nWhat I especially liked about \"October Sky.\" Even at its most bleak, the film remains hopeful. Colick's screenplay is filled with hope and dreams, and characters who dare to have both. Johnston has corralled an excellent cast to bring this story to life. Jake Gyllenhaal is outstanding as Homer, whose youthful exuberance betrays a maturity way beyond his years. Gyllenhaal's emotional range is incredible, and he says so much with his eyes. All father-son tales need a strong father figure, and \"October Sky\" has one in Chris Cooper. It would be so easy for Cooper to reduce John Hickam to a cliche, yet he brings much depth to the role.but you know there's more going on than meets the eye. Likewise, Laura Dern is so sweet as Miss Riley you almost miss the small touches she brings to her performance. There's hope in her eyes. Homer's friends are all exceptional, while Natalie Canerday shows great strength as Homer's mom. Director Johnston and his technical crew have done a splendid job of evoking time and place. Even though the film was shot in Tennessee, it looks and feels like West Virginia. John Ford would have been proud of this film. Yes, the message and the delivery may be a little sentimental, yet it works in the films favor. You'll laugh, you'll cry, but most of all, you'll feel good inside, and if that's a crime, then lock me up!\nOwen, bespectacled and goofy as the stereotypical math geek, suits the film's taste for typecasting as well as its quaintly 1950s look, which calls for studiously modest props and costumes, and for townsfolk who are often Rockwellishly agog.\nIn a film that appreciates the advent of \"Jailhouse Rock\" along with that of Sputnik, \"Ain't That a Shame?\" accompanies a montage of rockets gone kerflooey. A pretty girl is on hand to sigh, \"It sure was exciting watching your rockets go up!\"\nGyllenhaal does seem more like the Columbia University freshman he is than the rural West Virginian he plays. But he brings such sincerity to telling his science teacher that a book called \"Principles of Guided Missile Design\" is the best present he has ever received that his affecting performance is liable to breathe life into science projects everywhere.\nBut more often the film's tone is just right, and the spirit of adventure and invention is infectiously conveyed through Gyllenhaal and his well-cast fellow rocketeers, whose many failures gradually lead to triumph on their makeshift backwoods launching pad. Capturing time and place with impeccable detail and superbly developed characters (including Laura Dern as an inspiring schoolteacher), October Sky is a family film for the ages, encouraging the highest potential of the human spirit while giving viewers a clear view of a bygone era when \"the final frontier\" beckoned to the explorer in all of us.\nI loved this movie. It is one of the few movies that I have consistently recommended to friends to rent and have had all of them thank me for the referral. The film has some powerful themes that are beautifully scripted.\nThis is not just another movie it's the one that inspires you to dream!\"A single dream is more powerful than a thousand realities.\" ~ J.R.R.Tolkien",

I spent a rainy Sunday afternoon in Germany with not a lot to do, so I checked out the Pay-Per-View selections, and chose 'October Sky' over 'Tea With Mussolini', which I am still pretty confident was a good idea.We\u00b4ve seen this film before, and it was called 'Hoosiers'.  Or was it \"Rudy\" The same themes exist:  some backwoods youth or youths overcome adversity and do the un-do-able.  The same characters seem to ring in all these movies:  an overbearing father that thinks his kid is a dern fool; an inspiring role model and encourager...  But it was done much better than this in the aforementioned films \"Rudy\", and particularly \"Hoosiers\". \"October\u00b4s\" characters were one dimensional, the dialogue rivalled that of Titanic, and there was not enough detail put into the real rocket-making, in my opinion.  (OK, so I am an engineer... we tend to take the fun out of all science-related movies if they are not fully precise.)But please don\u00b4t think I hated it.  This film would be a perfect one to show to middle school and early high school students.  I would have found it inspiring at that age, especially since I was interested in science and enjoyed blowing things up.  So show this to your kids, they will probably enjoy it, and it is not something anyone would walk out of, although I found myself accidentally changing the channel a couple of times (remember, it was PPV!)  But please don\u00b4t think you\u00b4re about to see Lawrence of Arabia since it is rated in the top 250!",

I was blown away by the its power in portraying the interpersonal dynamics of a family more meaningfully and more realistically than any movie I have previously seen.

I'm serious.  This is a movie that parents need to watch once in a while to stay in touch with what parenting can be all about.This movie depicts a father in the multitude of shades in which real fathers exist.  He isn't perfect.  He makes mistakes.  But in the context of this movie, he is so real as to draw you inside the movie screen for the duration of the movie.  Every character in the movie shares in this magic.The casting was perfection.  The acting was superb.  The music is the perfect counterpoint to the drama.  The cinematography was exquisite, giving a color movie a feel and tone that I've only seen brought out in black and white films.  If this movie speaks to you, and I feel it will to most who see it, regardless of age, you won't watch it... you will live it.  You will experience it.This movie is about relationships.  Parent to child.  Brother to brother. It's about growing up, and finding your own way.  It's about the social stratification that occurs in high school.  And in the manner of Joseph Campbell, it's about following your bliss.I went to the movies to be entertained, as only a movie can entertain, and left in wonderment at having experienced one of the ten best movies of the decade.",

Forgettable for me, but worth watching for those two of you who haven't yet seen Field of Dreams, which had similar themes but was immeasurably more interesting.

Because of the technology of the time, the satellite orbited the earth and passed over the United States about every 19-hours.  It could be seen with the naked eye on a clear night, and the wonder of man putting an object into space is keenly opposed to the fear such a device struck in the minds of many citizens during the Cold War.Based on a true story, \"October Sky\" also chronicles the diametrically opposed views of life -- the wonder of a young man who sees his future involved in the vastness of space and the uncertainty thereof, and the concern of his father for his son's future -- determined that it will be solidly anchored in the constant of coal mining (confined space and underground).This film celebrates the wonderment of dreaming and the freedom to both pursue and succeed at that dream.

The mines sequences were very realistic, and even the death of a miner was portrayed with the perfection.  It was a straight forward, wonderful movie about the life of four young boys growing up in West Virginia. The only problem I had with the film was the casting of Miss Riley as a glamorous blond, instead of the pretty brunette that she was (just look at her when they show the home videos at the end).  Of course, that only bothers me because she's my cousin, no one else in the world really cares.  Overall, the movie was one of those films that drew me in.  It left me wanting more.

It follows the true story of Homer Hickam (Gyllenhaal) and his obsession with building rockets to go out into space. His infatuation pulls in his friends and a nerdy social outcast (Owen) and together they all get the nickname \"The Rocket Boys\". Through all the turmoil of trying to break out of their small coal mining hometown these boys prevail. One of the greatest obstacles that Homer had to go through was the views of his own father (Cooper) who thought what Homer wanted was only pipe dreams and that coal mining was going to be his life. This is a true story of overcoming opposition by all this world's forces.Gyllenhaal does a terrific job as our hometown hero. His youthful determination and strength plows through the screen and into your heart. The reality of Homer just makes his efforts in this movie more of an homage to the real man than just another role. Gyllenhaal treats it with the perfect amount of dignity and pride. The other impressive performace came from Cooper in his portrayal of Homer's coal mining father. The sheer hardness of his attitude towards Homer and his dreams matched the very coal he pulled from beneath the ground. He did show some admirable qualities throughout the film which gave the audience just enough reason to not write him off entirely as an uncaring and ignorant hick. Then at the end he opens his character up to the true depth of the love between a father and son.The direction and cinematography of this picture was beautiful throughout in not only its scenes of Homer's exciting rockets but also in the bleakness of life in a coal mining town. Johnston truly captured the harsh and heavy nature of mining life and the effects that it can have on those people and their families. This detailed very well the hard sacrifices that some people have to make in life just to survive.Recommendation: If you are looking for inspiration then look here. You can walk of this movie feeling that whatever it is that you want to do with your life can be done. The fact that this is a true story shows that your own circumstances could be far worse and that anyone can follow their dreams to the end. This type of motivational power hasn't been seen since Rocky.",

This is a movie that reminds us all what it's like to have a dream and what it means to have the courage and determination to pursue the dream, as implausable as it may seem.October Sky has to be one of the best movies I have seen in a while.  The story is simple, but beutifully told, well acted, and thought provoking. Many times Appalachia is portrayed as as isolated area with no chance of leaving, of following any dream. October Sky changes all that.  Sometimes, true stories are the best ones that make it to the screen.The realistic portrayal of Appalachian people is one of the film's strongest selling points.  It presents us in a postive, yet realistic light.  All the accents seemed authentic.  None of those dreadful Hollywood accents that reek with magnolia blossoms.  The conflict between father and son, the fear and excitement of leaving home, the bonds of friendship--all of these shine in this movie.  This film has humor, intelligence, drama and emotion. It is well deserving of accolades!",

The film, directed by Joe Johnston, tells the true story of Homer Hickam, a young boy from a small coal-mining town in West Virginia who dreams of building rockets and launching them into space.\n\nOne of the reasons why October Sky is such a great movie is its ability to draw the audience into the story and make them feel invested in the characters. The film portrays the struggles and challenges faced by Homer and his friends as they pursue their dream of building rockets, while also dealing with the expectations and limitations imposed by their families and community.\n\nThe performances of the cast are another standout feature of October Sky. Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays the lead role of Homer, delivers a nuanced and emotional performance that captures the character's determination and passion. The supporting cast, including Chris Cooper as Homer's father and Laura Dern as his teacher, also deliver memorable performances that bring depth and complexity to the story.\n\nThe movie also touches on several themes that resonate with audiences, such as the importance of following one's dreams and the power of education to change lives. These themes are woven into the fabric of the story and provide a sense of depth and meaning that elevates the film beyond a simple coming-of-age tale.\n\nOverall, October Sky is a heartwarming and inspiring movie that captures the essence of the American Dream. It is a powerful reminder of the importance of pursuing one's dreams and the impact that determination, passion, and perseverance can have in our lives. It is a movie that will leave you feeling uplifted, inspired, and grateful for the human spirit.",

            "content": "Heartwarming and inspiring true story that'll have you seeing rockets!\n\nJoe Johnston's historical coming of age drama October Sky (1999) is a picture burning with passion for science, discovery, education, family, and fellowship among men. Joe Johnston's direction is as peerless and enjoyable as any iconic director's grounded style. October Sky is as much a coming of age drama story like Stand by Me or Lady Bird as it is a film about coal miners, unions, and small town mindsets like Matewan or Coal Miner's Daughter. \n\nI always find director Joe Johnston's films to be kind hearted and focused on inspiring kids to remember themselves, to seek higher education in life, understand their parents, and for parents to empathize with their children. Lewis Colick's writing understands how teenagers talk among each other, wanting their desires to be in life, while sympathizing with the perspective and struggles of both children and their parents. October Sky may just help you pick your path in life.\n\nI believe October Sky creates a passion for rocket science and mathematics, while also making you want to go out and make friends, find a hobby, pursue a career you love, find love, and rekindle the love in your family. October Sky is made with love and care like all great Joe Johnston films like The Rocketeer, Jumanji, Honey I Shrunk the Kids, Captain America The First Avenger, or Hidalgo. October Sky is worth seeing for the rocket launches alone, let alone the life affirming true story about a boy wanting to leave his town to build rockets and gain his father's respect.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal is so sensitive and compelling as Homer Hickam, who figures his chance out of town is in building rockets. His frustrations and fears are apparent on Gyllenhaal's face. He was a fine actor before Donnie Darko, Brokeback Mountain, or Nightcrawler even. Laura Dern is so sweet and supportive as Homer's kind teacher Miss Riley. I don't know of a nicer performance in film from a lovelier actress than Laura Dern. \n\nChris Cooper is one mean, jaded, and reactionary father figure as Homer's tough father and mining boss John Hickam. It's cool to see Cooper do a mining picture after John Sayles' iconic Matewan with Cooper as the union creating leader, now an older man desperate to keep the livelihoods of his town in operation in a failing coal industry. Natalie Canerday is great as Homer's mother Elsie Hickam. Chris Owen is wonderful as the brainiac nerd Quentin Wilson alongside the other boys William Lee Scott and Chad Lindberg portray. I liked the nice girl Valentine Carmina as portrayed by Kaili Hollister. \n\nRobert Dalva's editing cuts quickly in montages of rocket building, launching, and exploding for a delightful series of training montages in rocket science. His sharp cuts make October Sky's 108 fly by like a rocket in the sky. Fred Murphy's cinematography uses natural scenery of forests in lush wide shots to deep and dark close-ups in the depths of the mines for a harsher effect. Jim Mitchell and Mark S. Miller's visual effects for the rocket launches are second to none and highly realistic. Mark Isham's score is lovely and definitely gets me emotional hearing his tender melodies. Betsy Cox' costumes look like the early 1950's and 1960's for sure.\n\nIn conclusion, October Sky delights me now as it did for me as a child. Any family should find a light of compassion and inspiration in watching it today.",

            "content": "\"October Sky\" is a pretty good movie with pretty good performances. Maybe even great, but I don't believe that it's one of the greatest family masterpieces it's often made out to be. The story was relatively interesting, starring a young Jake Gyllenhaal as real-life NASA engineer Homer Hickam. After the Soviet satellite Sputnik was sent into space, it instantly caught Hickam's interests and he knew that this was what he was going to do. His family doesn't believe in him, his town doesn't believe in him but one teacher does and it changes his life. I'm sorry, I know this is a true story and all but this movie is very predictable, around the half-way mark you know exactly what's going to happen almost in the order that it ends up doing. That makes the movie feel much longer than it is, probably didn't help that I was also watching it with my family very late at night. They frequently asked me \"how much longer?\" It's by no means a bad movie, not at all. It's average-length but just seems drawn out as the entire story could've easily been told in the span of 10 minutes. Ah, well. Still pretty good family movie, one of the better ones I think I've actually seen and I'd recommend it actually. I liked it, even though a lot of my sleepy siblings didn't. It's quite an inspiring tale of believing in yourself when no one else would but it just falls a little short for my personal tastes. It's still an excellent family movie though.",

I don't think any other movie does such a good job of telling an inspirational story about a kid from a small town with a really big dream. This is the ultimate \"feel good\" movie, but it also does a great job of capturing the relationship between Homer and everyone around him, particularly the relationship between him and his dad. The movie does such a mature job of capturing the conflict between their perspectives, as well as developing Homer's character and making us all root for him to land his big shot of winning the national science fair and being able to pursue greater goals. While I may be biased towards this movie, as I often feel like Homer myself, it is still undoubtedly a great film.",

            "content": "Can we all agree that any movie set in the 1950s should be directed by Joe Johnston? He has a magical way of capturing the nostalgic feel of that era. The way we are introduced to Coalwood, West Virginia makes you feel like this place has been around for generations. It\u2019s a quaint small town where everyone knows everyone else, and there\u2019s closeness throughout the entire community. The cast nailed the accents across the board (even if sometimes they look like they are doing a little extra work with their mouths to make it sound right.) The costume and set designers made everything look perfect. It all comes together to give October Sky an amazing sense of place and time that is authentic. You never get the sense that just off camera there is a studio or something, because the film takes you to Coalwood. I love the story of this rag-tag group of kids who work together to do something that seems improbable so that they can move on to bigger and better things. The scenes of them experimenting and figuring out all the little details they need to make a successful rocket were great. It helps that the cast of actors was excellent. However, I often have trouble with movies that include a character like the one Chris Cooper plays. He appears so unfeeling and insensitive throughout the film, that I find myself getting mad. It\u2019s even more tragic because it is a father-son relationship, and I want him to show his love by supporting his son instead of cutting him down. I\u2019m aware that the conflict is necessary to add drama to the story, and I imagine some of it was based in real events, but it\u2019s hard for me to watch. That being said, the lows that the film reaches makes the highs seem more thrilling and exciting. Speaking of lows and highs, that\u2019s one of the things I love about October Sky, the blatant symbolism of Homer Hickam\u2019s life is astounding. If it wasn\u2019t based on a true story, you\u2019d want to chastise the author for making the story too good to be true. The idea that Homer doesn\u2019t want to go down and be buried in the mine, but longs to soar into the heavens is delightful. Joe Johnston used that idea to full effect in this film, and there are a few shots that show the contrast of the two worlds so well I\u2019ll never forget them. While there were certain elements of October Sky that didn\u2019t click for me, I still enjoyed the story a lot, and it is one film I expect to revisit and fall in love with more in the future. ",

Cooper is a miner in a mining town in West Virginia and Gyllenhaal, who plays his son doesn't want to go into the family business. He wants to be a rocket scientist. It's based on a true story. It's no academy award winning movie, but it's very charming and so is Jake Gyllinhall. He's very young in it. The acting by everyone in it is adequate. Everything about it technically is adequate.  There's a fun little montage of them shooting, or trying to shoot of their rockets and failing over and over. The sound track was all 60's music which was enjoyable. Although a little predictable and a little derivative it was still pretty entertaining and enjoyable. Maybe because it's just so disgustingly feel good. I cried despite myself at the end. It's also just one of the most family oriented movies ever. If you have the whole family over and don't want to offend anyone, this is the perfect movie for that occasion. There's footage of the real people at the end of the movie. It's pretty fascinating.",

It provides good life lessons on following your own footsteps and be ambitious of what you enjoy doing. Even if it makes you hardheaded, this movie shows how taking your own advice is never a bad thing. \n\nJake Gyllenhaal delivered a memorable performance, and he stood true to his role as the NASA Engineer, Homer Hickam, Chris Cooper delivered a solid performance as John Hickam who has a lot of pride of himself. Laura Dern is an underrated actress, and she gave a good performance since Jurassic Park. The rest of the cast played their part pretty well.\n\nThe storyline was fantastic, providing emotion, joyness, and sadness to appeal everyone, no matter how old you are. What made it better is that it's based on a true story, focusing solely on Homer Hickam's life as a teenager. \n\nHere's the website where you can read my full review for this movie: http://geodude91.blogspot.com/2013/07/october-sky-review.html#!/2013/07/october-sky-review.html",

October Sky is a film that captures the excitement and the imagination of four teenage boys who believed they could do anything. Director Joe Johnston perfectly recreates mid-century West Virginia in a way that only he could do, and allows his cast to do most of the leg work. Jake Gyllenhaal leads the amazing cast, which features Laura Dern, Chris Cooper, and Natalie Canerday, all of whom give powerful performances. A film that could have simply been about a journey to the stars actually becomes about a strained father-son relationship. If the conclusion of the film doesn't have you in tears, you don't have a soul.\n\nFor more movie reviews visit: www.reelfive.com",

The answer is most definitely yes. The performances are solid, but some of the accents are a bit dodgy.  Chris Cooper plays much the same role he always plays. Gyllenhaal and the other young actors all manage to create unique characters (thanks in part to good writing).  The movie manages to tap into memories of looking to the skies and marveling at the stars with a skill that rarely is seen.  It evokes similar feelings to space as Field of Dreams or The Sandlot do for baseball, and the effect is powerful, moving, and well worth the time.",

            "content": "The Tragedy of Being Smarter Than Your Parents  \r\n\r\nIt can be hard to explain sometimes.  I am told that my father was incredibly intelligent, though I was too young at the time he died to have known.  My mother is not a stupid woman by any stretch of the imagination, but let us say that this is one of the many areas where I take after my father.  Mom was never anything but supportive, which may well have been in part because she had known my dad.  However, I never really felt that she understood.  How much worse would it have been if my mother had never had reason to understand or respect intelligence?  If she had seen my interest as betraying everything she stood for?  I don't know how many generations of this family worked in the mines, but it is true that the very idea of going to college meant Our Hero's turning his back on what his family stood for, what his father had done with his life.  It was intimidating to his father, and that's the great sorrow of the movie.\r\n\r\nOur Hero is Homer Hickham (Jake Gyllenhaal).  In October of 1957, he and his friends watched [i]Sputnik 1[/i] make its way across the sky, and they heard its beeping on the radio.  And Homer thought, \"That's my future.\"  He enlisted local nerd Quentin Wilson (Chris Owen) and Homer's friends Roy Lee Cooke (William Lee Scott) and Sherman O'Dell (Chad Lindberg), and together, they start building rockets.  The first ones aren't very good, but they get better and better.  However, Homer's father, John (Chris Cooper), isn't interested.  Homer's brother, Jim (Scott Miles), is a local football hero, and John respects that, but he doesn't respect the physics and trigonometry Homer is learning.  It only gets worse when the boys are accused of starting a forest fire with one of their rockets.  Homer has the support of the entire town, including teacher Freida J. Riley (Laura Dern), but not his father, despite the efforts of his mother, Elsie (Natalie Canerday).\r\n\r\nIt's sad, really.  The town was dying; there is no Coalwood, West Virginia anymore.  Traditionally, football was what let boys escape, when they could escape--football players got college scholarships.  Part of the conflict is that Homer is shown to know that, while his father did not.  His father is a coal miner, and that's all he knows.  He wants his boys to come and work in the coal mine, too; by turning his back on the mine, Homer is turning his back on his father.  (Though I can't help wondering what happened to girls who wanted to escape; they must have had even fewer options.)  The real-life Homer Hickham (who is a junior; his father's name is changed in this to avoid confusion) got out, but how many of his classmates went down into the mines when the mines closed?  How many died either in the mines or from mining-related causes?  It's still one of the most dangerous jobs in the US.  This country runs on coal still, and we need coal miners.  But coal mining is a hard life, and most of the boys in this movie never had any other choice.\r\n\r\nThe movie is sentimental almost to the point of syrup in places, but you know, it's good to see American ingenuity the focus of a family film.  For once, it isn't about the jocks, though the disc does come with a trailer for the movie of [i]Friday Night Lights[/i].  For once, it's the science fair that's what the town is cheering for.  And in many ways, that's how it should be; it's a lot easier to get out of a small town from being smart than being athletic.  There aren't enough spots on college football teams to take all the stars of the high school football teams, and there aren't enough spots in the pros to take all the stars of the college football teams.  If you can get an academic scholarship--and need-based grants--you've got a shot at a career that athletics can't necessarily provide.  We seem to spend too much screen time idolizing the careers that are hardest to get into, and while not everyone can be a rocket scientist, we do as a nation need to be training more engineers.\r\n\r\nI don't think everyone will understand the aspect of the movie which spoke most to me.  After all, the movie still does include Quentin to be mocked.  Even when the boys are the talk of the town, Homer assures Quentin that the girls still think he's weird.  Homer is expressly acknowledged to have difficulty with math.  However, if he's even of slightly above average intelligence, Homer is still smarter than most of the people around him, and his drive further sets him apart.  Heck, without him, Roy Lee and O'Dell would have gone down into the mines just like everyone else in town.  Leon Bolden (Randy Stripling) had been a Tuskegee Airman; while he works as an engineer, he still works for the mine.  Half the reason Homer goes down into the mine when he does is that the company owns their house and most of their furniture.  It doesn't seem to occur to his father that the kind of job Homer could get with an education would more than pay for their own house and furniture.",

What \"Hoosiers\" and \"Rudy\" did for sports, \"October Sky\" does for science and education; it celebrates a human accomplishment against all odds.  It is this rare quality, in addition to a witty screenplay, an array of fine performances, sharp direction by Joe Johnston, and a heartbreaking score by Mark Isham that make \"October Sky\" one of the finest \"Hollywood\" dramas of the 90s.

Homer grew up in a small town, but dreams to live a life better than what his stomping grounds can offer.  A tale many of us can relate to.  But this is also a story about winning the love of your father, and never giving up on your dreams no matter how impossible they seem.

But by October 4, 1957, when the Soviet satellite Sputnik flies overhead in the night sky, Homer Hickam Jr.'s life is changed forever. So with the help of his teacher, he and his three buddies start an amateur rocket program way out of the town limits. Even with his father's disapproval, a limited education, and a series of misfires that threaten his dreams and the town, Homer overcomes seemingly impossible odds to achieve his vision of earning his college scholarship and working in rocket science later in his lifetime. And he brought us this inspiring drama of his life, all immortalized on the screen.\n\nBased on the real Homer Hickam Jr.'s book 'Rocket Boys' and directed by Joe Johnston, 'October Sky' has good acting performances. I liked Jake Gyllenhaal's young Hickam character as well as his sense of individuality. Supporting Gyllenhaal includes Laura Dern (Ms. Riley) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam), both of which were very interesting characters. The film soundtrack is so inspiring for the 1950s setting; Buddy Holly's \"That'll Be The Day\" and sometimes the background instrumentals really sets me in a good mood.\n\nWhat can I say about 'October Sky'? It's a great historical drama for all audiences to enjoy, including the 1950s-era fans and the rocket scientists of the world.",

That, and it's got a notable cast including a young Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper, and Laura Dern.\n\nHickam did eventually become a NASA engineer, but the film primarily focuses on the earliest leg of that journey, and the scenes of him and his friends trying to get into the rocket game for themselves are both funny and charming. \n\nThis is Joe Johnston making a nice drama and pulling it off pretty well. He's got a spotty record, but this is one of his better efforts, and one I find my self enjoying quite a bit each time I see it. Sure, there are shades of typical tropes like the father wanting the son to follow in his footsteps, and people interested in a subject that doesn't fit in with what everyone else in their locale appreciates, but it's handled decently, and the performances are nice, too.",

October Sky is based on the truly inspirational childhood story of NASA Engineer Homer Hickham Jr. and his journey through a tough adolescence.  Overcoming tough family, social and educational issues, Homer was able to conquer the impossible, and in doing so, inspired an entire town.  Homer, along with his childhood friends (nicknamed \"The Rocket Boys\") are all examples of pure determination and integrity.  It's just a towering film that does everything right, it's not overly dramatic, it's littered with humor and it captivates you with it's very intense emotional concepts.  I'm a sucker for true stories, when they're done right, they can be a vessel to endlessly amazing stories and people.  October Sky is a stirring and engaging piece of expert craftmanship from acclaimed director Joe Johnston, it's tremendously powerful, spectacularly inspirational, amazingly intriguing, emotionally gripping and undeniably superb.  A film that should be shown to every student in every school, a perfect example of the timeless saying...you can do anything you put your mind to.  This one will sear itself into your memory and stay with you forever.  A small town American story that will forever have a place in your heart.  It's a slow-moving, but tensely told story that you won't be able to take your attention from.  A beautiful American story that's unlike anything you'll ever see. \n          The acting is excellent with brilliant performances from everyone involved.  Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent, Chris Cooper is brilliant, Laura Dern is great and Chris Owen does well too.  The talent shines in every scene.  The story was spectacular to begin with, but factor in the brilliant talents of the cast, it truly does click on all cylinders.",

October sky is an incredibly touching film that tells a wonderfull story about teens in a small forgotten town who want to do something more than just the expected. The movie really does an excellent job at recreating an old forgotten town and brings back the look and feel of the late 50s. This is essential as this helps set the tone and mood. But the anchor of the film is Jake Gyllenhaal. He gives a rich performance as the well meaning and somewhat spontaneous teenager who dreams of something more than what is expected of him. He is a very sympathetic character because he feels emotions and goes through things that many people can relate to. The other great performance is Chris Cooper as his strict and rahter unsupportive father. The drama between father and son is honest and touching and creates some very good tension. But above all October Sky is about chasing dreams and the determination to succeed despite what others may say or think and succeeds at being an authentic and honest tale of inspiration.

I mean you could take the most cynical, mysanthropic soul on this planet, have him watch \"October Sky\", and he'd have a healthier outlook on his life. I swear, during the last 10 minutes of this movie, I had the biggest shit-eating grin on my face - one of those endings you just can't help but get caught up in. The film features an abundant amount of fine performances. Namely, Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Homer Hickam, and Chris Cooper's compelling turn as his father, John. Other great performances came from Laura Dern, Chris Owen, William Lee Scott, and Chad Lindberg. The movie is shot to a magnificent degree. For instance, Cinematographer Fred Murphy really uses dismal lighting to magnify the miserable atmosphere within Coalwood, West Virginia. The movie is also edited to a tee. \"October Sky\"\u009d also possesses a brilliantly written screenplay that effectively tells the story with emotion as well as convey the narratives heartwarming themes. Overall, I feel that \"October Sky\"\u009d is an awe-inspiring coming-of-age tale of perseverance, respect, and hope. It's a movie that everyone can learn something from. I know I did.",

I was amazed that he could go from directing a movie as mature as this, to a complety immature film - Jurassic Park 3. The Acting was pretty decent, and I thought Laura Dern in particular was great, she kind of reminded me of Sandra Bullock's character from The Blind Side. The main thing in the film that I found annoying was Homer's (the main character) relationship with his dad. We've seen this \"Dad-wants-his-son-to-follow-in his-footsteps-and son-wants-to-be-independent\" relationship so many times, I got bored with the father-son scenes, instead of being entertained. But, all that being said, it was still a good movie, and if you haven't seen it and have got the time, I recommend checking it out.",

            "content": "October Sky is a film heavy on the stereotypes and the clich\u00c3 (C)s of hard life in the south. It focuses on the life of a real person, Homer Hickham(played by Jake Gyllenhaal), and his struggle to fulfill his passion in a town where getting a scholarship is a million to one shot and mining coal is the only way of life. I had originally seen this movie when I was about 10, and it was always one of my favorites. I loved the violin music that complements the nice cinematography showcasing the grit of West Virginia in 1957. The acting was also very good, even though it may have been stereotyped a big, and the language slacked a little. Chris Cooper plays a convincing and frustrated father who works opposite Jake Gyllenhaal who is a bright young man with huge dreams. The story is something we've all seen before but just can't stop watching. Joe Johnston, the director, created a very well made movie that makes us feel good as others like \"Remember the Titans, \" or \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" did. But again, who can ever tire of that formula? So, looking back at it now, there are some spotty parts and the chances of the 4 \"Rocket-boys,\" actually winning the Science Fair is scarce, but what makes it all tie together is the fact that it was based on a true story. We can sympathize with the 4 boys because their life is so tough and realistic it's almost heart-breaking to imagine what would've happened if they hadn't won the Science Fair. The way the movie plays out is almost like a Stephen King type story, where there are 4 boys all in a hick town where nothing good ever happens. Well, this is what a Stephen King story would most likely look like if it had a happy ending. Which is common in a movie like this, and yeah, how often does your dad who hates you ever come to see you perform on your last show? In this movie it appears probable. For those who may not understand the film's intent, just get it cleared out of the way before you watch the movie, that it IS meant to be uplifting and some what inspirational. I know it was for me when I was 10, and I still look back on it fondly as a favorite.",

            "content": "There are not enough superlatives in the English language to adequately celebrate the qualities of this movie. Director Joe Johnston handles this poetic examination of a teenage boy's unquenchable desire to cut his own path in life with a tenderness and affection for his subject. Gyllenhaal is extraordinary as the younger son of a West Virginia coal miner, determined to escape the gravitational pull of the coal mine while desperately trying to earn his father's understanding and respect. Chris Cooper shows he's one of the best actors working today with his gritty, totally genuine portrayal of John Hickam, the father struggling to come to terms with his son's maverick aspirations of a life far from the coal seams of Appalachia. The supporting cast is universally outstanding, particularly Laura Dern as Homer's inspirational high school teacher. Mark Isham's score, rich in bluegrass-y fiddle solos, beautifully captures the spiritual essence of the film. One of my top ten favorite films of all time.",

            "content": "October Sky ins the best feel good movie ever made. One of the things thats great about the film is the film doesn't go over board in it's sentimentality. Never does it feel overly sentimental, corny or embarrassing. This is the type of film that you will definitely feel good right after watching it.  You really sympathize with the characters because they are brilliantly played by the cast. I can't recall the number of times I've seen this film, but it's at least over a dozen times. Unlike other family films that try to be overly sentimental just for the sake of being family friendly and to appeal to a bigger audience. October Sky has something that separates it from other feel good films, and thats a very good story, and I mean good. October Sky is the true story of Homer Hickam a teenager who spots the Sputnik satellite and who decides to built his own rocket and enter the science fair. His dad is highly against it, and wants him to work in the mine. Homer has other ideas. October Sky is really a story about accomplishing your dreams, and achieving the impossible. This is simply an incredible story about perseverance and determination and unlike other feel good films, this is a true story, and the way it's told on film is beautiful. The film is brilliantly directed by Joe Johnson, director of Jumanji, and he crafts yet another great film. October Sky is a well acted film, the actors here are incredible and this was one of Jake Gyllenhaal's first staring roles, and is just the right person for this role.  Also a performance that is equally great is Chjris Cooper as Homer's father who opposes Homer's dreams. Both actors electrifying as they butt heads on screen as we see their conflicting ideas unfold. Chris Cooper is fine and underrated actor, and this is the first film that I've seen that exposed me to his work. October Sky is a solid feel good film and like I said, this is one of the best too. A fine cast upholds this film, and Johnson has got a fine script at hand. and because of that, the film works very well. The beauty part about this film is that this is the type of film that will stay with you long after you've seen it, and everyone can take something positive away from it. A fine film that in one word can be summarized as beautiful.",

First im going to give credit to the actors who all filled the roles of these historic characters perfectly. But most of all I would say it was a toss up between Chris Cooper and Jake Gyllenhaal for who did the best in the film. Cooper's character of Homer's father could be unlikeable at times but deep down you knew what kind of person he was and would do anything for his family. Gyllenhaal played Homer Hickman perfectly and is right next to his performance in Donnie Darko to be the best of his carrer which to some people isnt saying a lot but overall Gyllenhall is a pretty good actor. Also the other actors were good as well from Laura Dern, Chris Owen, William Lee Scott, and Chad Lindberg were all great in this film. Besides the acting I would say the directing is the best part. Joe Jhonston really let us know how important  this story and these characters really are and made the actors fill their roles perfectly. The writing is also good but I woulden't call it great I felt some words were rushed and easily used. Also the film can be a little overly dramatic and will try hard to make you tear up but it doesn't try \"that\" hard. This is also one of the most inspiring films i've seen and will always be in the right mood to watch it again. If you haven't seen it than you need to see it. A great film. 90%",

This is a movie for everyone who didn't have a chance to follow their heart but knows what it is like to follow our heart. Amazing movie, must watch for everyone and definitely for many in India!!",

So, I can't remember everything exactly, but what I really know is this:  I really liked the film.  I don't know a lot about the true story, but let's stick to the basics of the film.  \n     There was great acting, directing, and it was well written for the screen.  Everything seemed to flow smoothly from start to finish and the boys' in the film make you feel somewhat inspired.  I would also like to mention that there is a great score composed by Mark Isham accompanying the film.  \n     For the content, there is some language including a few profanities and vulgarities along with a briefly scene obscene hand gesture.  There are also a few mild swear words scattered throughout the film.  However, swearing is used infrequently.  Other than that, a few rockets blow up and almost injure some people, and we also see some injured coal miners and see the danger they face every day.\n     All that being said, \"October Sky\" is a great movie that I highly recommend!  4 1/2 stars.",

Homer, the main character is obsessed with launching rockets and with the inspiration of a schoolteacher comes from building rockets in the basement against his fathers will to designing components and showing them off in a national science fare. The film is a classic about a group of friends achieving something that wouldnt be impossible without each other.  In the film Homer (Jake Gyllenhaal) struggles to avoid the dead end life of a coal minor, that his father wants him to come and take over the coal mining business, which is not what he wants to become. \r\n\r\nThe Director Joe Johnston wittedly conjures up the 1950s teenage social order.  Johnston also places the town  out  of the way of anything that survives off mining where everybody belives that mining is the only way to survive and feed their families. During one school year, Homer and the rocket boys blast off into futures their parents didn't decide for them. Corny? Sure, but it is a movie that almost everybody will love.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the movie you see everybody that was once in his way step aside and help him to become a part of NASA, but that's another story. Personally I thought it was a great movie but I found the story very traditional, meaning that I found that it was about the same thing with nothing overly appealing. To me it was about love, friends, and reaching what appears to be the impossible that turns out to be not so impossible. Overall I loved it and would watch it again, as it was not painful to watch.\r\n\r\nHaving all this in mind, the film is a fine line between a classic story of friends and reaching your dreams. I found the movie a great movie for anyone looking for a movie that combines friends, love and fun.",

It's an inspiring, feel-good story about a son pursuing his dreams all the while trying desperately to earn the respect of a doubting father.  The only unfortunate aspect of the film is two unfathomable characters, one whose presence is critical to the plot.\r\n\r\nWas Homer Hickman Sr. really that opposed to his son pursuing rocketry?  In the world I come from, that is unimaginable.  Realizing this all takes place in the infancy of space exploration, it is reasonable to suspect a coal mining superintendent would encourage his son to follow him into the mines.  But the level of obsession written in for this character reeks of exaggeration.  It heightens the conflict, but I couldn't help but roll my eyes through some of those scenes shared by father and son.\r\n\r\nEven more perplexing was the school principal.  I found him to be a completely unrealistic character.\r\n\r\nBut enough with the negativity.  Anyone and everyone will enjoy this film.  The four youths, the \"Rocket Boys\", all bring something unique to the screen.  I always enjoy Natalie Canerday (Mrs. Hickam), mainly because I love that wonderful Sling Blade accent of hers. There is also an ample dose of humor to go along with the math and the various conflicts that arise.  And once the town gets behind these boys, it becomes quite a rollicking fun ride indeed.",

The post-Sputnik science-ed. sensation is certainly worthy of this fine treatment. I shared the pride that all of Coalwood felt when the \"rocket boys\" won the national science fair.

I can honestly say that after watching Joe Johnston's \"October Sky\" I feel a whole lot better about everything. Truly just an overwhelmingly inspiring and uplifting film. I mean you could take the most cynical, mysanthropic soul on this planet, have him watch \"October Sky\", and he'd have a healthier outlook on his life. I swear, during the last 10 minutes of this movie, I had the biggest **** grin on my face - one of those endings you just can't help but get caught up in. The film features an abundant amount of fine performances. Namely, Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Homer Hickam, and Chris Cooper's compelling turn as his father, John. Other great performances came from Laura Dern, Chris Owen, William Lee Scott, and Chad Lindberg. The movie is shot to a magnificent degree. For instance, Cinematographer Fred Murphy really uses dismal lighting to magnify the miserable atmosphere within Coalwood, West Virginia. The movie is also edited to a tee. \"October Sky\"",
