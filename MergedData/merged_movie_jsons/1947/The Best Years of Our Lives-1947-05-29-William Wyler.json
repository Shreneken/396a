            "content": "One of the great things about The Best Years of Our Lives that even though it dates itself rather firmly in the post World War II era, the issues it talks about are as real today as they were on V-E or V-J day of 1945. The problem of how to assimilate returning war veterans is as old as the written history of our planet.And while we don't often learn from history, we can be thankful that for once the United States of America did learn from what happened with its veterans after the previous World War. The GI Bill of Rights is mentioned in passing in The Best Years of Our Lives was possibly the greatest piece of social legislation from the last century. So many veterans did take advantage of it as do the veterans like Fredric March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell who you see here.All three of those actors played archetypal veterans, characters that every corner of the USA could identify with. They all meet on an army transport plane flying to the home town of all of them, Boone City, Iowa.War is a great leveler of class and distinction. Bank employee March, soda jerk Andrews, and high school football star Russell probably would never meet in real life even in a small town like Boone City. But they do meet and war forges indestructible bonds that can never be broken.March is the oldest, a man with two children and Hollywood's perfect wife Myrna Loy. He settles in the first and the best. He has some wonderful scenes, getting cockeyed drunk on his return and later with a little bit of liquor in him, tells the bank officials at a banquet off in no uncertain terms.I also love his scene where another returning veteran, a sharecropper wants to get a bank loan for his own piece of land. Watch March's expressions as he listens to the man's pitch for money. You can feel him read the man's soul. It's what got him his Second Best Actor Oscar for this film.Harold Russell was a real veteran who lost both his hands during service in the Pacific. He got a special recognition Oscar for his performance. Because of that it was probably unfair to nominate him in the Supporting Actor category which he also won in. His performance, especially his scenes with Cathy O'Donnell as his sweetheart who loves him with or without his hands, is beyond anything that could be described as acting.Dana Andrews is the only officer of the three, a bombardier in the Army Air Corps. Of the group of them, maybe he should have stayed in. He also comes from the poorest background of the group and he was an officer and a gentleman in that uniform. That uniform and those monthly allotment checks are what got Virginia Mayo interested enough to marry him. The problem is that he's considerably less in her eyes as a civilian.While Mayo is fooling around with Steve Cochran, Andrews has the great good fortune to have March's daughter Teresa Wright take an interest in him. They're the main story of the film, Andrews adjustment to civilian life and adjusting to the fact he married the wrong woman. Not all veteran's problems were solved with GI Bill.Myrna Loy gets little recognition for The Best Years of Our Lives. My guess is that it's because her role as wife was too much like the stereotypical wife roles she had patented over at MGM. Still as wife to March and mother to Wright she really is the glue that holds that family together.The Best Years of Our Lives won for Best Picture for Sam Goldwyn, Best Director for William Wyler and a few others besides the two acting Oscars it got. It was a critical and popular success, possibly the best film Sam Goldwyn ever produced. It remains to this day an endearing and enduring classic and will be so for centuries. It's almost three hours in length, but never once will your interest wane.The best tribute this film received came from Frank Capra who had a film of his own in the Oscar sweepstakes that year in several categories. In his memoirs he said that he was disappointed to be skunked at the Oscars that year, but that his friend and colleague William Wyler had created such a masterpiece he deserved every award he could get for it.By the way, the film Capra had hopes for was It's A Wonderful Life. The Beat Years of Our Lives can't get better praise than that.",

            "content": "The Best Years of Our Lives (1946)The whole point of this film when it was released still makes perfect sense today, though I'm sure it doesn't have the same impact it did in those first years after World War II ended. Returning servicemen, with all kinds of backgrounds before and during the war, hit a wall coming home: wives who no longer loved them, jobs that had dried up, a culture that was foreign to them and that found them, these men, to be foreign themselves.It wasn't a crisis to take lightly. These were the guys who were drafted to fight the enemy, and in going overseas they lost some of the best years of their lives, if not their lives. The country knew its debt in the abstract, but it also knew it in sons and husbands who really did come home and who had to face it all. This movie was both a reckoning for the sake of national healing and a brilliant drama that would be beautifully pertinent and therefore successful. And what a success, then and now.The consummate Hollywood director William Wyler shows in this fast, long movie just what a master he is at working the medium. With Gregg Toland at the camera, Wyler makes a highly fluid movie, visual and dramatic and weirdly highly efficient. With the three main plots interweaving and depending on each other, the drama (and melodrama) build but never beyond plausibility. Wyler knew his audience wouldn't put up with pandering or cheap mistakes. Casting Harold Russell as Homer, knowing the audience would hear about how Russell really was a soldier who lost both hands in the war, was a huge step toward creating both empathy and credibility. It even practices a key theme in the move--to go beyond your bounds to make a difference, to give these guys a break and help them assimilate.It's interesting how singular this movie is, trying to show the truth in these kinds of situations. The other post-war films about army and navy men fall into two large and dominating categories--war films and film noir. And it is film noir that comes closest to getting at the problem of the G.I. not reintegrating well, making it a whole style, brooding and spilling over with violence. \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" has a highly controlled and even contrived plot structure, but it aims to be honest and representative. That it's remarkable formally--the way it is shot and edited and acted, top to bottom--is not surprise, given the heights that Hollywood had reached by then, and given that Wyler is easily the slickest of them all, in the best sense. That the movie makes such beautiful sense and really works as a story, a moving and heartwarming story without undue sappiness, is a whole other kind of achievement. A terrific, rich, full-blooded, uncompromised movie.",

            "content": "Three WWII veterans return home to small-town America to discover that they and their families have been irreparably changed.Such a powerful film. At first the new lives of the soldiers seem to be facing small adjustments, such as their children's interest in \"atomic energy\" and \"scientific efficiency\". But soon we find that jobs are hard to find, and the wives and girlfriends sometimes met new people while the battles were fought.Although a serious topic, the film has the right balance of entertainment and drama. It never gets outright depressing, and things like depression and suicide are overlooked. But it still remains a valuable lesson: as bad as dying in the war is, sometimes the transition back to normalcy can be just as damaging.Although not one of the better known movies today (2014), \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" won seven Academy Awards in 1946, including Best Picture, Best Director (William Wyler), Best Actor (Fredric March), Best Supporting Actor (Harold Russell), Best Film Editing (Daniel Mandell), Best Adapted Screenplay (Robert Sherwood), and Best Original Score (Hugo Friedhofer). It still sits on the IMDb Top 250, just as it should.",

            "review_title": "The Troops are Coming Home.....",
            "content": "Though we had a plethora of films about troops returning from the Vietnam war and trying to re-integrate back into their societies, most of which were hard-hitting, angry voices against War, here is arguably the original - and best.Definitely a family orientated movie (Cert U) this will appeal to and find favour with all ages, but don't start thinking that this is all gooey, slushy nonsense. There's some quite hard-hitting topics covered, even by today's standards and of course, with our minds on our current troops in Iraq/Afghanistan, equally relevant.Multi-stranded, which each of the three G.I.'s immediate and extended families and friends being examined, it's about them coping, with varying degrees of success, with home life and getting jobs, now that the War is ended. It's the little observations and stories around them that are so fascinating, as the Heroes of yesterday are now anything but when it comes finding new purpose in a changed world.The cast is exemplary, not necessarily the biggest stars of the day but the most believable and natural for their roles. Dana Andrews, Myrna Loy and Fredric Marsh are the ones most easily recognisable and their appearances convey a sort of reassuring familiarity and normality. They're all excellent, of course.Though long, at nearly 3 hours, William Wyler's easy going but assured and tight direction keeps things flowing nicely and it never drags. This, my second viewing, is an enjoyable one as the first and if anything I'm more at ease with it.Though obviously not as exciting or dramatic as other 'normal' war films, it's a tragedy that it's not more well known. I've never seen it to ever have been on TV, or to my recollection, even Sky Movies, for that matter. Any movie that won 7 Oscars and is currently no. 180 in the top 250 IMDb's films of all time, voted by its voters (us, the public) is hardly one of minority interest.A friend I lent my DVD to watched it with his family and normally they only go for current films, or ones they know, but they not only enjoyed it, but felt enormously moved by it, too.If you haven't seen The Best Years... yet, make a mental note to do so. Your life won't change by doing so, but it really is worth the 3 hours of it that it will take. You certainly can't say the same about every film out there....",

            "content": "In 2004, I wrote the following statements on an IMDb message board when a user wondered if The Best Years of Our Lives was a forgotten movie: ***** To me watching this movie is like opening up a time capsule. I think in many ways \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is probably one of the more fascinating character studies and it holds up extremely well as a look at life in the US in the mid-1940s after WWII. I believe \"Coming Home\" and \"The Deer Hunter\", both released in 1978, were the most recent films that were closest in capturing the numerous issues of military men returning from war that were brought up in \"The Best Years of Our Lives\".What really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when I was in college around 1980-81 and many if not all of the college students applauded at the end of the movie.This movie still packs a wallop and I'm very happy to read in other posts other users feeling of a movie that will definitely stand the test of time. *****I'm very happy to see the movie ranked near the top 100 movies on IMDb and AFI. Also, though it was in competition with what eventually became a Christmas classic, It's a Wonderful Life, arguably, The Best Years of Our Lives' Oscar wins, including Best Picture, were very well-deserved. I've just seen the film again in 2005 and after almost 60 years, The Best Years of Our Lives is still a powerful, beautifully acted and well-crafted motion picture.",

            "review_title": "Window on an era",
            "content": "This is one of the important movies. It was when it was first released in 1946, addressing as it did the issue of veterans returning from WW2, and the affect it had on them and their families. It focused on three men, all psychologically scarred, and one who has lost both arms. They return to a small city in the U.S., but the themes of the film were universal.That was 70 years ago, and over the years, the movie has tended to move into the background - there have been more wars and more veterans returning with their own issues.However, I think the importance of this movie can't be underestimated now that the WW2 generation is fading away.WW2 was well covered; we have millions of feet of newsreel film as well as towering stacks of history books. However, movies from the era do something quite unique; they get inside the emotions and the feelings - they represent the mindset of the time. Audiences identified with the issues through the stars in a way that was very personal. Hollywood did this job best - it was entertainment, but it was also a commitment to a generation.At the end of the war and into the 50's, Hollywood addressed the aftermath - \"Till the End of Time\", \"The Men\", \"My Foolish Heart\", \"The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit\" and others, but \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" towers above them all.The film could never really be remade. It was created by people who had experienced the war either in combat or on the home front. Many behind the camera had served including director William Wyler who had flown dangerous missions making documentaries about the U.S. Air Force; he was left nearly deaf from the experience.The film tackled tough issues and attitudes. Sergeant Al Stephenson (Frederick March) returns from the Philippines, but he hasn't seen his kids for years and he seems out of step with them. Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) returns to an unfaithful wife and an uncertain future, he was good at war but what now? Real-life amputee Harold Russell plays Homer Parrish. He has much to overcome, but his girlfriend remains loyal, and he emerges as possibly the best adjusted of them all; he accepts what he can't change, and just gets on with it.The film has a powerful score by Hugo Friedhofer. Friedhofer was not as famous as Newman, Korngold or Steiner but he was as good. He surpassed himself here; his music helped express the unspoken thoughts of the actors - there are sections of this score that bring a lump to the throat.This was my parent's generation; my father was in the Australian army and fought in the war. And although this movie was about Americans, the story resonated far wider.Of course you could argue that some issues were not tackled - and that also gives an insight into an era, but with that said, this film is a window on the ideas and forces that were shaping society at a critical time in modern history. Seen that way, it's a movie that may never lose its relevance.",

            "content": "Some months ago, a co-worker and I were discussing our favorite movies, and his happened to be \"The Best Years of Our Lives\". I had certainly heard of it before, and knew it ranked highly on the IMDb and AFI lists of all time top movies. Up till now though, it had remained low on my radar, but I requested it through my local library system and got a chance to see it today. The film has to be one of the best ever in dealing with the return of military soldiers to civilian life, certainly the best regarding servicemen from World War II. It wisely stays away from battle scene flash backs to concentrate on the human drama of three ordinary men thrust back into a world they have to familiarize themselves with all over again. Their experiences range from the happiness of friends and family to have them back home, to the wrenching adjustments they must make individually as befits their respective situations. Perhaps the most heart wrenching is the personal ordeal of sailor Homer Parrish (Harold Russell), a real life veteran who lost his hands in an accident while training paratroopers at Camp MacKall, North Carolina. You would never know Russell wasn't an accomplished actor of his own accord, and for his effort in the film, was recognized as the only actor in history to win two Oscars for the same role in a picture (Best Supporting Actor and an Honorary Award for bringing hope and courage to fellow veterans).All of the performances by the principals are uniformly believable and consistent, with Fredric March and Dana Andrews rounding out the wartime trio who hook up by chance for a flight home to Boone City, a fictional city set in the Midwest. Young viewers probably won't believe the visibility offered by the nose of a B-15 bomber, just like I couldn't get over it when I saw the real thing at the National Air and Space Museum's Udvar-Hazy Center. There, the cockpit and nose section of the Enola Gay (actually a B-29 bomber) is on display, and seeing it, I earned an even greater appreciation and respect for the combat fliers who went to war for their country.Watching the film today, it's surprising how daring director William Wyler was in executing the story. The first example of course was using Harold Russell in a lead role, but you also have themes that were downright shocking in the 1940's. When Peggy Stephenson (Teresa Wright) declares that she's going to cause the divorce of Fred Derry (Andrews) and his wife Marie (Virginia Mayo), you can almost hear the gasps of movie patrons back in the day. And even though it's played for laughs, I had to wonder about the scene when Fred and Al Stephenson (March) were bundled up in the back seat of the family car in a drunken stupor. Speaking of which, stay attentive to the scene at Butch's tavern; Al introduces Fred and Homer to his family using each other's names. Of course by that time he was already a bit pie-eyed, so if it was a mistake, at least it was a credible one.If you never saw the credits for the movie, I think you'd be hard pressed to rank the actors in the story, so good are the performances and the screen time shared by the leads. To my mind, Harold Russell and his story are the standouts, but one could make as good a case for Dana Andrews and his conflicted relationship with wife Marie and the love he finds with Peggy. I'd have to surmise that Myrna Loy and Fredric March are top billed because they were the biggest names at the time, but that takes nothing away from their roles either, ones in which they attempt to rekindle a marriage following the strain of war and separation. You know, there were times that Myrna Loy seemed to have a devilish look in her eye like she was itching to go into a Nora Charles characterization, but had to restrain herself for the more sedate role she had. She probably should have had a scene where she could cut loose, but that wasn't the mission so to speak. You've also got Hoagy Carmichael aboard for a few musical numbers, which leads into the wedding march that helps close the story.It's hard today to try to imagine the kind of things returning servicemen had to endure returning to civilian life. The story helps set that tone with the men attempting to get back into the work force. I found it to be quite a disparity for Fred to be employed as a soda fountain clerk at $32.50 a week, while Al goes back to his bank with a promotion and a raise to twelve thousand a year, roughly two hundred fifty dollars a week. When Al took sympathy and a chance on a loan for a deserving veteran, it leads to some wonderful dialog about the kind of collateral a man brings to the table, the kind that can't be measured in money and property, but the kind that comes from the hands, the heart and the guts. That's what the true spirit of America was once, and is still if you can find it underneath all the garish headlines and muck that passes for news today. \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" works because it portrays everyday heroes doing courageous things off the battlefield, where for most of us, that's where it really counts.",

Consider the rampant PTSD and all the other factors that affect the lives of these young men and women. Some are maimed and some are psychologically damaged as they try to resume their lives. This film brings a portrait of three men who have left the same war, World War II, with various handicaps. One has lost his hands in an accident, one has become bitter and dissatisfied with the treatment of his fellow military comrade, and the third goes back to his wife, who has no interest in him anymore, who is only interested in a meal ticket. We get to see how war has changed these people. The handicapped man is the most obvious, as he longs for normalcy, yet watches as his family and friends drop into a depressed state, utterly aware of his limitations. They don't mean to, but they take away his humanity. He falls into the pits of depression, almost driving away the one who loves him most. The other two wrestle with their own demons. This is beautifully presented in a subtle way, without being maudlin. Of course, Hollywood requires a sappy ending. Still, the rest of the movie, including the great Hoagie Carmichael as a piano playing bar owner, stands on its own merit. I hadn't seen this movie in nearly forty years and it was a delight.",

Few films have remained as relevant, realistic and pertinent, nor captured the frustrations felt by returning heroes, under circumstances none of us would wish for, than this timeless masterpiece.",

            "content": "I first saw this film (one of my top ten favorites) in 1995 on the big screen, as part of the commemorations for the 50th anniversary of the end of WWII. It had an impact that was so strong that it's never left me--I've seen it many times since, and with each viewing the film seems to reveal new artistic richness and spiritual depth.William Wyler's direction is breathtaking.  One of the most moving scenes occurs early on in the film, when Homer, the young disabled Navy veteran, arrives at his family home and stands for a moment on the front lawn.  For that one second there is an exquisite stillness that communicates a depth of emotion that can't be expressed physically.  Then, just as the tension becomes almost unbearable, Homer's little sister Louella comes to the front door and runs out to greet him.  In a similar way, the scene where Al Stephenson comes home to his wife and children is so finely directed you can almost feel that you're in the apartment with them--that it's your husband or father come home to you from the war--and you're experiencing the sheer elation of their physical nearness.This aspect of the film--its portrayal of the joys and hardships of post-war readjustment and the veterans' experience--is what makes it so enlightening, honest and powerful.  As a young woman, I have never experienced wartime or had my father, brothers or friends go off to fight. The film moves swiftly but seamlessly from the initial joy of homecoming and reunion to the problems, anxieties and humiliations that the three veterans encounter as they attempt to build a new life for themselves and their families.\nI found it interesting how the film tries to give a picture of the different socio-economic backgrounds of the three men, and show the emergence of an affluent, market-driven economy.  While this in itself is not bad, different episodes in the film show how this economic approach can conflict sharply at times with enduring human values such as integrity and justice.  Al's dealings with the young veteran Mr Novak, who comes to him for a service loan to buy a farm, and his later (slightly tipsy) speech to a business gathering show this.  Al declares at the end of his speech that when the bank lends money to poor veterans it will be a financial gamble but \"we'll be gambling on the future of this country\".The film's interweaving of the characters and their struggles never falters and is deeply satisfying.  Even as Al and Milly, Homer and Wilma gradually move towards a happy resolution of their difficulties this positive strand of the film is counter-balanced by the focus on Fred, the courageous Air Force captain who, in the eyes of the commercial world is \"unqualified\", suitable only for a job at a soda fountain, and in the eyes of his war bride, Marie, is only wonderful when he's dressed up in his officer's uniform.  Fred's situation seems only to deteriorate and at one point in the film, after he farewells his elderly father to leave town and look for work, the father finds the citations for Fred's medals and sits down to read them. As he reads the words describing Fred's bravery and dedication to duty while he was terribly wounded in his aircraft, Pat Derry's voice nearly breaks with pride and love for his son.  The film beautifully juxtaposes Fred's unselfish conduct and willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice with the cold indifference of a country in peacetime that does not want him and seemingly has no place for him.The actors are uniformly impressive and really make their characters come alive.  Dana Andrews is especially outstanding together with two young actors making their debut, Harold Russell and Cathy O'Donnell, as Homer and Wilma.  Personally, I loved Homer and Wilma's story the best among those of all the characters,and the resolution is a simple, sensitively shot scene that lifts the whole film to a new point of happiness, gratitude and release.  Both Cathy O'Donnell and Teresa Wright are lovely, gifted actresses with a slightly understated style, that is perfectly suited to the film's restrained but powerful tenor.  This is demonstrated especially well in the tense scene where Wilma tries to talk to Homer in the shed, and in the scene where Peggy confides her heartache to her parents.One feature that adds significantly to the film's quality is Hugo Friedhofer's score.  The music is remarkably fresh and undated, has a strong, classic sound, and is poignant without being too romantic or sentimental (a flaw often found in other 1940s film scores).The producer, Samuel Goldwyn, reportedly said of this film: \"I don't care if it doesn't make a nickel...I just want every man, woman and child in America to see it\".  Although I'm not American (I am Australian) I found this film, with its universal human themes and its portrayal of post-war readjustment, speaks to anyone who shares in this heritage of WWII.  Tell others about this film--it is breathtaking, beautiful and brave.  See it and remember.",

            "review_title": "Among Best Films Of Our Lives",
            "content": "Not seldom have we seen veterans returning from wars in movies and certain assumptions are likely, but THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES occurs to be an exceptionally memorable treatment of the theme. Bosley Crowther in New York Times, soon after the premiere of William Wyler's gripping work, pointed out accurately that the film \"visions the overflowing humors and the curious pathos of such returns, and it honestly and sensitively images the terrible loneliness of the man who has been hurt.\" One of the major strengths of this film, therefore, does not lie in entertainment (though it does not lack it whatsoever) or any sort of heroic deeds worn in glorified patriotism (something that many movies of the time did not resist), but in the very empathy it employs to the theme and the characters. William Wyler speaks to the generation with clarity and modesty derived from his very experience with the men of Air Forces. Roger Ebert develops the thought labeling the central theme as \"sobering at the problems veterans faced.\" He adds that \"Wyler doesn't pump in superfluous drama\" but actually IS with his characters and with/for his audiences. As a result, the story does not resort to the specific time of history but concludes in a rather universal, timeless insight into psychological and moral aspects of those troublesome torments and alienation therein endured. Ebert explains the fact why the movie so wonderfully passed a test of time with three adjectives applied to it: \"lean, direct, honest.\" Let me highlight those features from the standpoint of the three veterans herein depicted.The main cast do not only come from various backgrounds, do not only portray different personalities with common experience yet diverse backgrounds but truly surprise us at multiple levels. All of them truly deservedly credit.FREDRIC MARCH, a very famous actor at the time, does a splendid job as sergeant Al Stephenson coming back home to his wife Milly (played with bravura and charm by Myrna Loy) and two kids, a daughter Peggy (played with subtlety by Teresa Wright) and a son Rob (Michael Hall). He is 'lean, direct and honest' in both merry-go-round scenes and serious moments but most captivating at the very adjustment to the family after the years of absence. The terrific ability to balance the hilarious with the serious is something that makes March's performance deserve particular attention. Although he has come back from war, much is at war within him...DANA ANDREWS as a former bombardier Fred Derry is a totally different character to analyze and perceive in the very context of pre-war vs. post-war reality - something many viewers of the time could identify with and most viewers of our time can fully understand. His destiny is shaped in direction towards Al's family (he is in love with Peggy) and yet, distorted by the haunting past and wrong choices. Here, who calls our attention is his wife Marie (Virginia Mayo), a conceited, vain woman occupied with what one looks like rather than bothering to consider what one feels. Andrews is given much freedom on the screen to develop the character on a great scale for the time. He does well. But the most intriguing and perhaps the most identifiable character among them is...HAROLD RUSSELL as Homer Parrish, a sailor most hurt by the war. His artificial hands, steel hooks have become almost a symbol of the movie's most powerful anti-war aspect, and, at the same time, the reason why the story may be called \"food for quiet and humanizing thought\" (Crowther). His character moves us most and leaves us almost reflective because it embodies honesty. Homer Parrish is a living statement that evokes the indifference and arrogance of war. He is in love with Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell) but he has to confront the reality the war experience has given to him. He is no longer the way he dreamed to be. Yet, the awareness of being loved helps him go on. Consider the bedroom scene with Wilma and the genuine tears of joy at having heard she loves him. Deservedly Mr Russell got the Oscar for the role and there is no question about one thing: such a screen achievement may be considered one among the very best roles of one's life. In this character lies quiet, subtle, captivating heroism.Among the female characters, great performances are delivered by Myrna Loy as Al's wife whose acting Crowther labels as \"charmingly reticent\" and Teresa Wright as Peggy who highlights trustworthy enthusiasm and youthfullness in difficult times. Virginia Mayo's \"brassy and brutal\" (Crowther) depiction also bears watching.In all this achievement, kudos to cinematographer Gregg Toland who employs high contrast lighting with terrific visual resonance added to the the whole story and builds the scenes upon exceptional clarity. Along with the obvious contribution of the director William Wyler, no less appreciation should go to the screenplay by Robert E. Sherwood for the perfectly framed plot(s).THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES may undeniably be considered as one among the best films of our lives, an intense emotional link between the characters on screen and viewers where genuine feelings conquer heroic victories.",

            "content": "Wow. I have a ton of reviews and never got around to reviewing one of my very favorite films. While I know you can't really say which movie is best, I really can't think of another film off the top of my head that is better. I can easily see how it made the top 250 and think it would probably be rated a lot higher if it had come out recently--as the 250 is very much skewed towards newer films.I think the biggest reason I love the film is the casting. While Frederic March and Dana Andrews were genuine stars at the time, they were not huge names like Gable, Stewart or Grant. I love these three actors but think the film benefited from March (who was no longer the handsome matin\u00e9e idol he'd been in the 30s) and Andrews (who played an \"everyman\"-type guy in most of his films). Plus, the genius of casting Harold Russell as the third returning serviceman cannot be minimized. While I hate movies that patronize the handicapped (I have a deaf daughter and cringe at patronizing), Russell's performance was anything but and was amazingly honest and powerful--earning him a very well-deserved special Oscar for his performance, not his disability. The family and friends of these men also worked out so very well. I just can't say enough positive about it.And, of course, the choice of actors and the type performance they gave was due in large part to William Wyler--my vote as the greatest director ever. Why he is not recognized as every bit the genius that Fellini, Bergman, Hitchcock, Kurosawa or Kubrick were, I don't know (actually, I think he was far better than all these directors with the exception of Kurosawa, but that's a discussion for another place). If you don't believe me about his genius, do an IMDb search on the films he made--no other director comes close in the sheer number of great films. Plus, watch the film at least two or three times and you'll notice all the fantastic scenes--wonderful camera shots (like the ones in the nosecone of the airplane) or scenes involving real people (such as the one with Harold Russell with his fianc\u00e9 as she tucks him into bed--I am fighting off tears now just thinking about it).This film also has an unbelievable script--pure, real and captivating throughout! A film about returning war vets could have been trite or jingoistic, but this one maintains it dignity and humanity throughout. I challenge you to watch this and not be impressed. Unless you are a member or Al-Qaeda or a 100% America-hater, you will be hooked. And this means that French or British or Italians or those of any other nationality should be able to find so much to love and appreciate from this film than transcends nations.",

            "content": "When Al Stephenson asks his children \"You've changed, what happened?\", \"just four years of normal growth\" says his daughter Peggy, kisses and joy ensue while this line is cooking in our head. Yes, one simple absence is liable to create shifts of misunderstanding even with your beloved ones. I have always said that besides love and respect, understanding was the underrated cement of relationships, \"The Best years of Our Lives\" explore that issue through the intertwined post-war lives of three WW2 veterans.Fredric March is Al, a forty-something banker who comes back unwounded but fails to recognize his home, Peggy (Teresa Wright) grew up and gained such maturity she became a mother's substitute and his son has long abandoned the war's patriotic scope for more sensitive questions about the use of the Nuclear force. The housewife (Myrna Loy) is overwhelmed by Al's come-back but you can feel the tension, when the heat is over, Al feels entrapped and needs to celebrate his comeback anywhere but out of the house. That \"Going for a drink\" excuse was subtly foreshadowed by the similar reluctance of Homer Parrish to meet his folks. Homer is perhaps the heart of the story, a sailor who lost his hands in duty but took it all in stride, minimizing the loss and being thanking the Navy for having taught him the use of his hooks. We're impressed by his ability to light a match and sign his name but as Al points out, they never taught him to take his fianc\u00e9e in his arms and stroke her hair, though a better line could have been \"they didn't teach the family to handle them\".Homer's no fool, he notices her mother's sobbing gasp at the sight of the hooks and knows he's going to handle awkward guilt-driven demonstrations of love. As a result, he doesn't even talk about the marriage with his fianc\u00e9e (Cathy O'Donnell) fearing she couldn't handle it, or maybe wishing she wouldn't. The irony of Homer, played with genuine intensity by Harold Russell, is that he doesn't want to be seen as a freak but is reminded of his handicap because he looks in people's eyes like in a mirror, or does he see his own reflection?And then there's Fred, Dana Andrews, he comes from a poorer neighborhood and his wife (Virginia Mayo) seemed to have left the house. She's obviously a \"tramp\" and soon the pride and exaltation of having a dashing husband in his uniform leads to the disillusion of unemployment. Once a respected and brave captain, Fred becomes a soda jerk, a loser in the eyes of society and his wife, for what it's worth. Fred finds the needed comfort in Peggy, she can see that he's unhappy in marriage, likewise in society.Now that the most prevalent war veteran figure is the Vietnam vet who saw his best friend being blown to pieces in Nam, here's 1946 Best Picture, directed by ace director William Wyler, and reminding us that post-war isn't just all about PTSD, shell shock and dark memories, there are physical and emotional scars, but perhaps the toughest part of the job is to try to adjust yourself to a world that changed, before you realize you're the one who changed. \"Mudbound\" handled that issue in 2017, and quite well.\"The Best Years of Our Lives\" centers on these three men's lives and their families in the generic town of Boone City. Each man represents a side effect of the war. Although it would be tempting to treat their arcs separately, I like the way the three of them tie the plot together and rather than speaking different statements about a subject, make a positive message converging toward its heart-warming conclusion, after almost three hours of a journey into the everyday lives of normal citizens.And this is what impressed me the most in Wyler's tone, he doesn't go for any sensational effect, or overuse of pathos, there's no forced drama or twists, the film is long because it has a certain desire to build solid and realistic bonds. In any other movie, the romance between Teresa Wright and Dana Andrews would look phony and contrived but the first day is as long as the wedding in \"The Godfather\", you feel the realness of every interaction, and both Andrews or Wright seem to succumb to a relationship they wanted to resist first.The performances are so good I couldn't believe only March (who was splendid) and Russell were nominated, they won though, and Russell even won a second Oscar for his inspiration for WW veterans. But if you consider the whole cast, Myrna Low, Dana Andrews and Teresa Wright deserved nominations as well, but I guess they weren't because sometimes, the talent of an actor is enhanced by the directing, and the film owes a lot to William Wyler. It can ever be regarded as a school case of masterful directing.Indeed, what we take for great acting is sometimes a wonderful attention to details and characters behaving independently. In the Parrish' reunion scene, check how the father and then the mother has their first glimpses on Homer's hooks and try to ignore it. Another masterstroke is the phone booth scene, consisting on Homer playing piano with his Uncle (Hoagy Carmichael), Harry listening to them and Fred making a crucial phone call at that moment. Three actions compacted in one scene, meanwhile, many long moments dedicated to seemingly mundane trivialities, eating breakfast, dancing, drinking, working at the office.Wyler knows what deserves several minutes and what can be handled in one and each character is given enough time and substance. And you know why? Because the story is all about people trying to reinvent themselves, for that, we need to know a little about their background, about what they are, and what they want to be, the film looks simple, but it's far more complex, intellectually engaging. Not to mention 100% relevant today.",

Okay, this is just only my second time watching this film and both times it was during Veterans' Day. So it's a very touching story of three former military men coming home to a much changed world that they have to adjust to. Fredric March is an Army sergeant who takes back his bank job, Dana Andrews was a bombadier pilot who reluctantly goes back to his drugstore job, and Harold Russell is a sailor who has to live with his hooks for hands. Russell was actually a nonactor who got picked because director William Wyler saw him in an Army short called Diary of a Sergeant where Harold silently performed his way with how he functioned with his hooks. He's actually good bringing his emotions to his characterization as when he confronts someone he disagrees with or has to show and tell his high school sweetheart about his condition. So much so that he ended up getting two Oscars: a special one \"for bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance\" and Best Supporting Actor. In fact, everyone is excellent in their roles. I especially liked Cathy O'Donnell as Homer's (Russell's role) girlfriend and Teresa Wright as March's grown daughter who takes a shine to Andrews. In fact, while I still consider It's a Wonderful Life my favorite movie, I'm now very glad the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave this one the BP award!

Although released just after World War Two the movie has survived the test of time, principally because of the the nature of the story which deals with issues that are timeless in their relevancy. This movie is proof that \"they don't make 'em like that anymore.\" It is hard to imagine Hollywood being able to recreate this movie today. The audience would be able to relate to the story - who couldn't?. But who'd play the roles? Could any actor today play Fred Derry without it becoming a laughable caricature of the returning war vet? Could any actor today play an Al Stephenson without coming off as being a bloated middle-aged phony? The trouble with Hollywood today is that when it tries to make a movie about a serious subject, especially one based on actual events, it usually becomes a confused jumble of special effects interspersed with inane dialogue which veers away from the actual historical event which is shunted to the background. There are exceptions. \"Forrest Gump\" with Tom Hanks and Gary Sinese deals in part with the subject of returning war vets, but that is not the main theme of the movie. \"Saving Private Ryan\" with Tom Hanks, Vin Diesel and Tom Sizemore must get high marks for its excellent portrayals of soldiers in combat, but this movie deals with soldiers who are still fighting, not the postwar aftermath. \"Dear Hunter\" with Robert DeNiro and Christopher Walken, \"Born on the Fourth of July\" with Tom Cruise and \"Coming Home\" with Jon Voight and Jane Fonda, are about postwar adjustment issues and all three are very good, very powerful movies. But even these movies have certain melodramatic features that make them rather stagy, with more focus on interpersonal dysfunctionality than on the actual events that may have contributed to the problematic behavior. The closest that Hollywood comes to approaching Best Years in terms of artistic style and thematic content is \"The Men\" with Marlon Brando, made in 1950. Filmed in a film-noir style, Best Years is far more subdued, far more intense, far more sophisticated, far less hysterical and therefore far more compelling than the other aforementioned movies. Anyway, go watch the movie.One other item. This movie is proof that Dana Andrews was one of the greatest actors ever in the history Hollywood. The entire movie centers around his performance as Fred Derry, a character which Mr. Andrews brings to life and which has become a symbol for all soldiers who return home.",

            "content": "Thirty years prior to THE DEER HUNTER came this movie, an excellent meditation on the effects of war inflicted on the American family as seen from both the war heroes and their wives. A truly ironic title, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES is anything but since those times have vanished into still images and all that is left is an uncertain future for those involved.Truly an ensemble cast despite the top-billing of Myrna Loy, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES focuses more on the stories of the men. Al Stephenson (Fredric March) comes back to a household that has irrevocably changed as his sons have grown although he finds support from his doting wife Milly (Myrna Loy). Fred Derry, upon returning, cannot find a decent job despite being a war veteran and is trapped in a marriage that he does not want to Marie, a happy-go-lucky girl who wants more out of life and who increasingly comes to hate him. Homer Parrish, on the other hand, has greater problems due to his loss of hands at war and feels the entire world -- including the girl he loves and her family -- thinks he is a freak of nature.At almost three hours of length, the film never seems long and drawn out. There is so much emotions happening even in small moments that the plot breezes by; nothing seems wasted or placed on screen due to a lack of editing. Not a performance rings false, though the standouts are those of Dana Andrews as Fred Derry, Harold Russell as Homer Parrish and Virginia Mayo as Marie Derry. Even then every character has his or her moment on film, and the time was right to talk about all the pain and suffering that until then had not been seen in American films (including the ones made around World War One, which did not dabble in such topics). While there is never any overt violence, it's all there, in the haunted expressions of the three male leads' faces, in the lot where the planes now reside, ready to be turned into junk (and therefore, forgetfulness), in the cynicism of the store owners who couldn't be bothered to employ these shell-shocked men who had seen battle or even worse, to goad them into wondering what was it all worth for.

            "content": "The Best Years of Our Life is often compared to It's a Wonderful Life. They never should be. Their only commonality is the desire to make a serious comment about a war that took millions of lives. It is hard to know what value individual life may have. (How many people know that 1 in 22 people lost their lives violently in the last century? What a statistic we have to live with.) Also our feelings about war have changed in 60 years. We have progressively moved from thinking that war is just if the enemy is the right one to believing that no war is totally just, especially the ones that have been fought recently.I have been a life long pacifist. I oppose all war. Not long ago I had that position tested. It occurred while I was on the USS Lexington, which is permanently anchored in Corpus Christi, Texas. The ship required a crew that is 3 or 4times the community in which I live. It is a powerful experience, moving around on her decks. She had seen a great deal of action. Someone granted me the right to be a pacifist and it was not cheaply bought.I cannot watch The Best Years of Our Life without thinking about things like the Lexington.Each of the three veterans paid their dues. And they paid mine as well.No one of them got off any easier than any other. The Navy, Air Force and Army paid equally although in different ways. Each had problems directly related to the war. And each had to work terribly hard to overcome those difficulties. It took more courage to face their civilian surroundings than it did to deal with war, because each had to do it on his own. Each could understand and sympathize with the problem of the others: ultimately no one could help.The moving part of the film (this could be the beginning part of the spoiler) is what follows when one of the male leads found someone who knew enough to give advice. The obvious case is when Derry told Herald to marry the girl. Don't hesitate, do it tomorrow. It is hard for Harold to believe that anyone could love him when he had been a football hero and athletic star before the war. But to his credit, Harold listens.The other is when Al tells Derry to stay away from his daughter. The meaning was clear. Mend your relationship with your wife \u0096 standard fair for 30's/40's films. Derry did not debate the point: he felt he was not fit for Al's daughter. So he agreed. The truth of the film comes out when we consider the daughter feels the same way about Derry. Real emotions from real people. I think our era has deep problems with feelings and sentiment and honor. I sometimes think we believe these values do not exist. That's perhaps why people looking at this film have problems.Al is not free of advice he does not totally want. Any time his boss talks to him, Al gets tied in knots. And rightly so. There are some things that cannot be judged by the standards of occupation: they must be judged by huge general intangibles and only someone tested by the severities of life would understand what those intangibles are.All of this leads up to a scene near the end where all the planes that fought so valiantly are stripped, stacked, stored, discarded and soon to be recycled: their function, worth and pride as translucent as Derry himself. He can overcome that translucency which he does, making him fit, in his mind, for the woman he loves.I gave The Best Years of Our Lives a 10 and there are few films I feel that way about. This is not a film for popcorn. It deserves our attention. We are very privileged to eves drop on something so private as the lives of these wonderful people. We ought to be careful that we don't abuse that privilege.",

            "content": "\"How many times have I said I hated you and believed it in my heart? How many times have you said you were sick and tired of me, and that we were all washed up? How many times have we had to fall in love all over again?\"One of the many reasons to love The Best Years of Our Lives is because there are so many different characters, ensuring that everyone in the audience can identify with someone. This is a story that touches you, no matter how old you are. It may be the most beloved movie celebrating our veterans, but it isn't necessarily a \"coming home\" movie. This is a movie that shows how different people cope with the same problem: What do you do when the best years of your life are behind you?Another of the many reasons to love this movie is Hugo Friedhofer's Academy-Award winning score. This is one of the few movies ever made where each character has his or her own theme. His music evokes so many emotions from his listeners, the perfect mixture of nostalgia, tragedy, hope, love, resignation, patriotism, and perseverance. One of the many times you watch the film-because I'm sure you'll buy a copy and watch it all the time-try and imagine how terribly Max Steiner or Franz Waxman would have ruined the tender scenes.Three veterans, Fredric March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell, return to the same hometown at the end of WWII. They're extremely different, and had they not been travelling companions on the way back, they probably wouldn't have even met. As it is, they make a fast friendship, and it changes the course of their lives. Freddie returns home to two grown children and must readjust to life at home with his wife and work at the bank. Dana left for the war a hotshot soda jerk, and he married just before shipping out. When he comes home, he's in for two rude awakenings: he's not qualified for civilian work, and his wife wants everything to be fun and carefree as it was before. Harold has to make the greatest adjustment of all: he lost his hands. His character, Homer, was different in the original novel; director William Wyler rewrote the character to have lost his hands because he'd met veteran Harold Russell and wanted him to act in the movie. There are no special effects in this film; the hooks you see are really Harold's hooks. It's no wonder he won Best Supporting Actor in 1947 and also took home a second Oscar for inspiring our veterans!It's impossible to choose a favorite of the three veterans' stories, because they're all relatable, cleverly written, and realistically acted. Even the smallest roles are acted beautifully. For example. Dana Andrew's father and stepmother, Roman Bonnen and Gladys George, are only onscreen for about five minutes, but their scene is one of the most touching for parents in the audience to watch. Fredric March won his second Oscar for this movie, and it's not hard to see why. He gives yet another incredible performance, and as his character frequently uses alcohol to help him adjust to his new life, his levels of intoxication are flawlessly realistic. Myrna Loy, Freddie's wife, is one of the most underrated classic actresses, and she gives the perfect portrayal of \"the wife\". Donna Reed and June Allyson were often cited as ideal wives during that time period, but they've got nothing on Myrna Loy. Dana Andrews wasn't often given roles to show off his dramatic talents, but he was able to show them off in The Best Years of Our Lives. His character in the original novel is the lead, and in the film, he's given many choice scenes to show other veterans they're not alone in their disappointments, regrets, and recurrent nightmares from the battlefield.As usual, William Wyler's impeccable directions adds to the dramatic essence of the film. He knows how to get to the core of the scene and never uses the camera to distract the audience. Equal to his talent is that of screenwriter Robert E. Sherwood. He took one of the most depressing, morbid novellas The Bishop's Wife and turned it into a delightful Christmas classic, and he adapted the novel Glory for Me, written entirely in verse, into a three hour masterpiece. I've read Glory for Me, and it's incredibly moving in its own right, but the talent it took to turn it into a screenplay is mindblowing.This is not only a wonderful tribute to our veterans, but it shows the serious adjustments they make when they come home, without ever becoming overly dramatic. This is not only one of the best old movies ever made, but it's one of the greatest films of all time. If you've never seen it, or you've only seen the remake The Lucky Ones, buy a copy, along with a box of Kleenex.",

I just saw it for the first time now at the end of 2016, 70 years from its original release and i can safely say - this is an absolutely must see movie for everyone. I loved everything in this picture. Writing, of course, comes in the first place. It is a superb one, highly involving, sometimes painfully true and always plausible. Magnificent acting by 4 central actors. Yes, i do believe that there are 4 magnificent performances, first of all of 3 lead men - Fredric March (Al), Dana Andrews (Fred), Harold Russell (Homer) and a terrific performance by Teresa Wright as Peggy who i think was under rated for this performance - i can't remember when i have saw more natural, charming and all the way great performance by a lady from a movies before 1946 - i won't believe that anybody didn't had a bit crush on this charming young lady. And of course directing was amazing, as well as the story itself which is sometimes hard to watch, sometimes hard to not laugh and always amazingly told and inspiring.Overall, all in all \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is great, great movie. At running time almost 3 hours i was captivated from start till the very last frame. The movie ended perfectly, i can not recommend this movie any higher to anyone who hasn't witness it yet - do your self a favor and watch it - this is a unforgettable motion picture. Great movie.",

            "content": "I disagree with those who only went so far as to call \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" one of the best movies about returning servicemen. I believe it is one of the best movies ever made, period. It alternates with \"Casablanca\" for my all-time favorite movie, depending on which one I have seen most recently.The best compliment I can pay to this movie is that I hold it in such high regard despite having gone into my first viewing wanting to hate it. How dare this film win the best picture Oscar over my favorite movie (at the time) \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" went my thinking. But when I saw \"Best Years,\" I was blown away and I understood.\"Best Years\" has an unbelievable number of scenes that bring a tear to the eye or a lump to the throat, with only a couple of those being the result of sadness, and with most being caused by beautiful depictions of love, loyalty, pride, patriotism, or the overcoming of personal adversity. I only need to hear the opening strains of the Homer and Wilma theme music before the bedroom scene to start losing it.What I enjoy most about the plot is how steadfast all of the lead women are, each in their own unique way. I know Harold Russell and Fredric March won the Oscars-- and they were great-- but for me, Dana Andrews as Fred and the wonderful Teresa Wright as Peggy are the standouts. I find Fred's statement that Peggy should be put into mass production to be very apt.One final aspect of the movie that fascinates me is how it can be such a perfect time-capsule of 1940s America, yet still not feel dated in terms of its human interactions.I am on the clock, waiting for my next opportunity to enjoy this complete and utter masterpiece!",

            "review_title": "Some of this film's greatest moments were scenes without a spoken word!",
            "content": "There are several thoughtful reviews of this movie here already - most all of which I concur with.I'll try to add a couple of unique comments about this most wonderful of films.It occurred to me that some of this films greatest and most touching moments are told without dialogue:The scene so many readers here have already mentioned - when Fred visits the boneyard for all those bombers waiting for the scrap heap. Through the camera work and Mr. Andrews' acting, we too are transported back to his harrowing missions aboard one of these planes. The urgency, the fear, the terror, the danger are all palpable at once as though we're in the cockpit too, flying over Europe against great enemy resistance, even though it's a sunny day somewhere in America in a lot  for surplus aircraft. When I watched that scene, I felt like I really knew what tremendous ordeals he had endured. I felt for Fred now that this plane, that had been so decisively important, just as he himself had been so important, risking his life in service to his country as part of the plane's crew suddenly no longer served any useful purpose.The scene where Homer is just about to go to his girlfriend's, Wilma's, house as planned - but he stops and he watches her through the window as she works in the kitchen, and plainly, we see that she is dear to him. But instead of going in to see her, with great struggle he changes his mind and he goes home and to his room. What a sweet room it is! It's the room he left - just out of high school - to join the navy. It's a high school student's room, a boy's room in his parent's house, with his trophies and pennants on the wall. He looks around at his boyhood triumphs and - we see through the camera - he stops and looks at his posed portrait in his football uniform, his right arm cocked back holding the football, his left arm pointing towards the imaginary receiver his head up, proud, and his gaze confident and purposeful. And then he looks at an action shot of himself dribbling the basketball past defenders. I can't begin to assess what Homer could be feeling at that moment - feelings of loss? of uselessness? Is he thinking that he'll be forever a boy - dependent on his parents and that he'll never be able to be his own man? That sequence - all without dialogue - speaks volumes!The kicker for me though, is the reminder that this is not merely a character in a story that has moved me, but this is also a real person who lost both his hands in service to his country. Those photographs of him holding the football and dribbling the basketball sure look to me like they are real pictures of the real person, Mr. Harold Russell, who plays Homer. What kind of courage did he have to look those things in the face for millions of viewers to witness? And how hard was it for Mr. Russell the person to make light of his character's and his own real life disability by playing Chopsticks on the piano with his \"hooks\" for everyone's amusement?Those two scenes stick in my mind as the most powerful to me - but there are so many more in this movie. It's worth noting that they were so effective without any dialogue at all. An actor shares a soul stirring revelation and it is carefully captured and revealed for us with sensitive and skillful film making.This is one of those movies that would go on a very short list of all time favorites. It's not perfect - when I can detach myself emotionally from the people in this story I can say that it could possibly be just a little heavy handed with it's message, but to watch this movie with all it's masterful performances from so many in the cast all assembled so lovingly and with great such great care by a great director - I have to think that it is very near perfect.I read here on IMDB under Harold Russell's (plays Homer) bio that he sold his Oscar in order to pay for surgery for his wife!! He is still living, retired on Cape Cod. Someone, somehow should get his Oscar back to him. It seems so wrong!! He paid very dearly with flesh and blood and bone and then had to, while on display, stare his loss in the face for the benefit of the movie going public. Someone should return his Oscar to him - the Academy? Steven Spielberg? Tom Hanks? William Wyler's heirs? I don't know who, but someone should really do that for him. It seems like a small price to pay for what he gave.",

            "content": "The main triumph of this film which makes it quite exceptional and unique of its kind is the performance of Harold Russell as Homer Parrish, who has lost both his hands in the war, which invalidity he shares with Harold Russell. It's a story and film about war veterans and without doubt the best of its kind for its humanity and extremely sustained restraint all the way in the exposure of very sensitive and personal affairs and feelings of the most delicate kind. All the actors are outstanding in their characterizations, Fredric March as the sergeant and former banker who can't quite control himself or his bottle, Harold Russell in the performance of his life, (the pajama scene must melt all hearts,) the only time ever an actor received two Oscars for the same part and well deserved, Dana Andrews as the noble war hero who is humiliated by his wife (Virginia Mayo perfectly abominable) but has the very good luck of finding the irresistible Teresa Wright instead and at her most charming, who is so much the better, and Myrna Loy finally as the sage and stable mother. The music is perfectly fit to illustrate the moods and the tensions, with Hoagy Carmichael crowning it, while the mastership of the direction of William Wyler in his slow and careful but very well thought out and intentional direction to bring out all the best and the truth of the story from his actors probably takes the prize. The film has a number of unforgettable scenes of singular eloquence, but I think my favorite would be Dana Andrews' revisit of his old pilot job in the junkyard, one of William Wyler's most impressive scenes, and there is an important forewarning of it in the beginning. This is a veteran film for all times which is inexhaustible in its humanity and which all people of all generations have something to learn from to improve themselves with. Finally I have never seen so many reviews for a film here, but a film like this just can't have a review too many.",

            "content": "This subject has been treated in many ways and many times. But I think Wyler has probably approached it in the best way; not only does he study the situation from the families points of views which have been separated for 4 or 5 years but he takes also a sharp view on the attitude of the ordinary people in a town towards the soldier coming back from faraway places and where they were confronted to life and death every day.The USA were lucky enough not to have faced the destruction such as London, or France or other European countries including Germany and Japan. Pearl Harbor although so tragic that it was is nothing compared to what happened on the other side of the Atlantic. It made the rehabilitation of the soldiers much more difficult because in their homeland the people could not really appreciate what they had been through, what they saw. All was a little bit theoretical for the US citizen at home.The scene in the movie when Fred looses his job after his fight with the customer is exemplary of this misunderstanding of the citizen who was nicely at home while the soldier had to face the real war with all its horrors and fears and dangers. A huge psychological gap had been established between two generations if not more. This was probably not so acute in Europe because we were in the middle of the conflict, with everyday alerts etc. The soldiers' families knew what bombardments meant, the fear of being arrested for no reason by the Nazis etc. The real problem was for those who had been interned in concentration camps and who probably for a majority never really found a normal life again after what they had witnessed and suffered.An other aspect is slightly approached by Wyler. The fact that after the war, after having seen on newsreels the horrors discovered in Germany perpetrated by the Nazis, there were still in the US, many people who pretended the country should not have gone to war and continued to have an isolationist position on the matter.In fact what Wyler shows very well is that the US soldier coming home, was arriving like a stranger in a foreign country. And if he had been wounded seriously like Homer he had also to face the reaction and ability of his family and friends to cope with his handicap which made it more difficult to adjust to his new life as a civilian.The movie is so well directed and the script so perfect that nearly 70 years later it has not aged a bit. Few war films can pretend to realize this.",

His wife has cheated on him, he's suffering post-war trauma, and can't find a job--but he's still charming and funny. Even though his opinion of himself is pretty low, he keeps going ahead. I love how self-denigrating the character is, how he suspects he's pretty worthless, while his parents, friends and Peggy (but not his wife) see him as extraordinary.

However, for me this film's greatness is timeless. Its characters may be ordinary, but they're real.  William Wyler, long after he had directed BEN HUR and WUTHERING HEIGHTS as well as countless other classics, regarded this movie as his best one.  He's right.  The sublime music score, the deep-focus cinematography, the humanistic writing, the exquisite casting, and virtually every element make it a contender for the most perfect Hollywood motion picture of the forties.I think anyone who wants to be a better human being would like it.",

From the beginning of American involvement (and dating to the period before our Declaration of War), the Studios had done their part in the area of \"Morale Building.\" OF COURSE THERE is another word for this particular; a word and practice that is widespread, universally employed by every nation in every time during all wars. In short, the practice is called \"Propoganda\"; which for some reason continues to take on connotative meaning of something evil. For after all, the word \"Propoganda\" is derived from the verb \"to Propogate; which means \"to breed or increase in volume of either plants & animals, or any inanimate objects or ideas.\" THAT THE MOVIE Colony did its part in the War Effort truly goes without saying. But, just as the rest of the World would have to readjust itself toward a \"Peacetime\" Mode; so too would the Movie Studios. But before any state of \"normalcy\" could be achieved, the chapter about the multi-faceted Global Conflict would have to give way to a Post War, period of \"Peacetime\". But it is not unreasonable to portray life in transition.OTHER THAN THE thousands of casualties accumulated during the years following December 7, 1941 to May 8, 1945 ( V E Day) and August 14, 1945 (V J Day), there was much to be considered. What of the walking wounded;being those who bore war caused physical and emotional scars, which they would have to contend with.THE STORY OPENS up by introducing us to three returning Servicemen' all three headed home to the same town, Boone City; yet all three were strangers to each other, Each man is from a different part of town, a different station in life. The three strangers hitching a ride on board an Army Air Force transport plane are: Army Infantry Sergeant Al Stephenson (Frederick March), Army Air Corps Captain Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) and Navy Seaman First Class Homer Parrish.IN ADDITION TO their difficulties in returning to civilian life, the hitch in the Armed Forces of World War II; for each man has experienced the unintentional effects of a sort of social engineering. While being an accidental occurrence, the unrelenting dictates of the highly regimented military life remakes each man into whatever the whatever the War Effort demanded.HENCE, WE SEE that Al Stephenson (Frederich March) appears to be the gruff,working class, middle-aged infantry sergeant. Back in civilian life, Al returns to his role as a banker, with a wife (Myrna Loy) and two grown children (including Teresa Wright). Al lives in an exclusive hotel residence, complete with all the trappings of wealth.WHEREAS AL STEPHENSON seemed more gruff and working class, Air Force Captain Fred Derry (Dana Andrews), the guy who appeared to have the most in rank, status,position, etc. As it turned out the fly-boy officer was from the poorest section of blue collar tenements. Adding to Fred's re-entry problems is his quickie marriage to flighty floozy, Marie (Virginia Mayo).OUR LAST PRINCIPAL, Homer Parrish (portrayed by real life amputee veteran, Harold Russell) has to wrestle with his own inner self in coming to terms with living without his hands, and going on to marry his childhood sweetheart, Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell).PLOT COMPLICATIONS INCLUDE Fred Derry and Peggy Stephenson (Miss Teresa Wright) falling in love. As an act of poetic justice, the very shallow, scatter-brained Marie Derry (Virginia Mayo) announces her intention to seek a divorce; as she goes stepping out with old \"friend\", Cliffy (Steve Cochran).EMPLOYMENT TROUBLES, IGNORANT know it all citizens (like the jerk portrayed by Ray Teal) in the Drug Store's Lunch Counter.AT A RUNNING time of 172 minutes, the film does not seem to be at all excessively long, nor is it ever seem padded out. Nearly 3 full hours transpire, and there appears to be a hopeful, if not exactly \"happy ending.\" ONE THING IS sure, and that is that after over 60 years of being out there, be it on TV or at a Revival Theatre (such as Chicago's Music Box Theatre on North Southport Avenue), THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES was, and remains one of the greatest films of all time, period!",

But at the time, the movie had some shocking elements to it. In fact, my mother (roughly the character Peggy's age then) saw it against her parents' wishes.Back in 1946, it was a jaw-dropper to have a character in a movie utter the word \"divorce\" or to aver an intent to break up a marriage -- such ideas just weren't voiced in films then. To modern audiences, they come across as melodramatic, but I'm told they elcited genuine gasps from audiences then.Even more astonishing was William Wyler's decision to cast real-life amputee Harold Russell in the key role of a returning Navy veteran. Until <i>The Battle of Britain</i>, in which an actual, disfigured RAF veteran made a cameo appearance, directors didn't make those sorts of courageous gestures. The intimate yet innocent scene in which Homer Parrish (Russell) demonstrates his helplessness to his fianc\u00e9 Wilma Cameron (Cathy O'Donnell) is beautiful, heartbreaking and uplifting; later, during the wedding scene, Russell stumbled over a line in saying the vows, and Wyler left the humanizing mistake in, God bless him for it.",

            "content": "Wyler was a very good director but his films usually have a chameleon like quality where while good they feel like any number of other directors. I think this is why Wyler's stock has gone down over the year. But that is not the case here as it is very clear that a man returning home from WWII was the driving force behind this film. (Wyler served in a filmmaking unit). The film feels very authentic and in the details it rings true.I like how screenplay did its best to represent as many types of veterans as possible. You get a pilot, infantry, and a sailor. You have struggles around PTSD, physical disability and changes in mores. You have various statuses around relationships. Far to often films like this try to reduce collective experience down to a single narrative but here the very good screenplay resist that urge.Finally, the film is of course wonderfully acted. For my money Harold Russell gives the most engrossing performance of the film. It is not the most polished performance but it doesn't have to be. It is a raw true performance. It all adds up to a very good film indeed.",

            "content": "Best Years of Our Lives is a film that slipped under my radar for years--I had heard about it, but never had the opportunity to watch it. Thanks to TCM On Demand, I was able to watch it uncut and commercial free.What surprised me about this film was how quickly it was made after the war. The film frankly deals with the people who were wounded in the war, both physically and mentally. It manages neatly to encompass nearly all the varieties of war experience within three characters.We have the Air Force officer, who was a veteran of the early European bombing campaign. Because of the horrific attrition rate amongst the crews of the bombers, the Air Force at that time had a reputation for cranking out officers who quickly rose through the ranks. Such was case with this fellow who went from a lowly soda jerk in civilian life to a Captain and bombardier of his B-17. He also suffers from PTSD, called \"battle fatigue\" at the time.We have the Army non-com who served in the Pacific, and suffered through the horrors of that campaign. His story is opposite that of the Air Force fellow in that he goes from a prestigious job as a banker to a lowly grunt in the Army and rises to the rank of Sergeant. From the stripes on his sleeve it is clear that he is the highest level of Sergeant, yet he is still on the front line.Finally we have the Navy Seaman, who is part of the faceless support staff, commonly referred to as REMFs (Rear Echelon MFers)by the fellows on the line. Ironically, he suffers the worst physical wounds when working as a mechanic below decks on a Navy ship, his ship is struck, presumably by a kamikaze and is sunk with loss of 400 lives. He is pulled from the water but his badly burned hands are amputated and replaced with prosthetic hooks.BYOOL tells the story of how these three meet on a transport plane they have boarded for home, and how they readjust into civilian society.What impressed me most about this film is that despite the obvious issues that face the three protagonists, it never descends into melodrama. The Navy kid, played by an actual amputee, is placed into situations where we might feel sorry for him, yet the script never lets us feel that emotion. The Army sergeant is clearly an alcoholic, and the story points that out, but never dwells on it. The Air Force captain struggles with the loss of status when he is forced to return to the drug store he soda jerked in (now bought out by a large chain) and take a demeaning job to support his ungrateful and disloyal wife.The script allows plenty of opportunities for all these characters to come to some dramatic climax regarding their plights, but it neatly avoids that. But for the overly dramatic score, the director has tread around exploiting the obvious.In one scene that well represents the entire movie, the daughter of the Army sergeant (Frederic March) is having a discussion with her father and mother regarding the Air Force captain. Despite his marriage, they have fallen in love, and she is determined to break up the marriage which is obviously troubled. Now we've seen thousands of scenes typical of this where the father blusters angrily and the daughter ends up running away to her room in tears, slamming the door and falling on the bed. Later, Mom shows up, consoles daughter and offers words of motherly wisdom, and everybody lives happily ever after.In BYOOL, this scene plays out completely differently than the clich\u00e9 I have described above. Sure the conversation gets heated, but all parties are reasonable, and there is a serious and timeless discussion of the nature of relationships that has some of the best dialog I have seen.Ultimately, BYOOL is a highly satisfying film, with honest performances from the entire cast. Technically, it is well shot, the editing and cinematography frame, but never overshadow the gripping narrative. Despite the score, which is clich\u00e9 and over-dramatic, I give this film the highest rating that it clearly deserves",

All three led opposite lives during the war (Executive Banker became an army corporal, a soda jerk became an Air Force Captain and the High School Football hero loses both his arms in battle)and now each must reconstruct his life and connect with a new reality.  The homes they return to, with grown children and independent, working women along with a depressed economy, only add to the strife.  It's the scenes just off camera and the unspoken dialog which resonates the most loudly, however.  The awkward intimacy of Frederich March and Myrna Loy and his struggle to return to his place as leader (both at home and at work) are heartbreaking.\nDana Andrews is riveting as the handsome, decorated Captain who struggles to keep his life together without the uniform.The film is filled with honest characters and each is portrayed by a gifted actor.This film, however, took on a whole other level after seeing, \"Saving Private Ryan.\"  The reality and magnitude of what these men lived through for love and country......and obviously it didn't end on the battlefield.\nThis is an essential for any collection.",

            "content": "Nothing to add, really, to the encomia of praise contained below. I had missed catching this iconic flick several times on TCM and finally caught up with it. I had feared it might be somewhat of a soap opera, but it is an exemplar of the type of film that is able to make the viewer care very deeply about the characters portrayed. The bond that is clearly shown between the three central characters - men who had not previously known each other, either at home or during the war - shows us what a powerful bonding experience fighting for one's country is. They clearly \"know\" each other in a way that transcends geography and class. In a certain way this movie tells us more about WWII than many of the overtly action flicks.Another thing that this great movie brings home is the sad difference between moviemaking then and now. What we have here is clearly a powerful story about a shared national experience, with great relevance to people's lives and a strong social commentary, done up as a work of cinematic art, and Sam Goldwyn, William Wyler and all involved knew it. Compare this with the crass way that today's Hollywood churns out the dreck it calls \"product\", with its eyes on nothing else than the bottom line.To me the culmination of the movie is when Fred, waiting for his departing plane, climbs into one of the derelict bombers on the field. The sound track and the visuals give us closeups of the engines, and we hear the sound of them starting, taking the viewer into Fred's reverie of his wartime memories, rudely broken when a field attendant asks him what he's doing. It's one of the most miraculous moments in cinema.A note: those not familiar with the story of Harold Russell, the amputee who played Homer Parrish and went on to found AMVETS, would do well to look it up. His is a fascinating story. (And IMDB is just the place to look it up!)",

            "content": "'The Best Years of Our Lives (1946)' is one of the most powerful war films I've seen, and yet its story begins after WWII had officially ended. Too often in cinema, the end of the battle is considered the end of the war: a sweeping camera movement, an upwelling of stirring music, the hurrah of victorious soldiers, and suddenly everything is all right. But war doesn't end when the guns stop blazing, nor when the politicians put their pens to paper. War lingers for days, months, and years. Returning veterans, even those who emerged from conflict without a scratch, faced an uphill battle to reclaim their former lives, having sacrificed their happiest years in service to their country. In 1946, the issues faced by war veterans had only just come to public light. 1944 saw the introduction of the G.I. Bill, which allowed ex-serviceman access to low-interest loans with which to rebuild their lives. Post-traumatic stress disorder in soldiers had previously only been explored in the film noir 'The Blue Dahlia (1946).'Three soldiers from different social classes, returning to their home- town after years of conflict, are united in their desire to rekindle their former lives. But things will never be the same as before. Homer Parrish (true-life war veteran Harold Russell) lost his hands in battle, and fears that his faithful girlfriend (Cathy O'Donnell) remains with him only out of pity. Working-class pilot Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) finds that, despite his distinguished achievements in war-time, he still lacks the necessary experience to assimilate into civilian life. Al Stephenson (Fredric March) returns to children he barely recognises, but finds consolation in \"the perfect wife\" Myrna Loy. The intertwining journeys faced by each of the veterans are often uncomfortable to watch, sometimes shameful and embarrassing, but the overriding message is one of hope: whatever adversities these men must confront, they can be sure to rely upon the support of their family, friends and the grateful United States government.Gregg Toland's crisp deep-focus photography is excellent, but the major strength in William Wyler's drama are the characters themselves. Harold Russell, who actually did lose his hands in combat, was hand-picked from a military documentary on rehabilitated soldiers, and his performance works so well because it's genuine. Russell is clearly an amateur next to the neatly-balanced dramatics of March and Andrews \u2013 he even flubs his characters' wedding vows \u2013 but the emotion is authentic, and his pain heartbreaking. Fredric March won his second Oscar (after 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931)') for his role as a banker who lost his commercial hardness in the trenches. A little disappointingly, his character doesn't figure prominently in the film's second half, his role somewhat reduced to that of a vector facilitating Andrews' melodramatic, but satisfying, romance with Teresa Wright. I would have liked the film to have more thoroughly explored Stephenson's detached relationship with his children, but evidently there were time constraints to be considered \u2013 having said that, though, the 172 minutes flies by effortlessly.",

            "content": "I must have seen this film ten times on the Bill Kennedy Show while growing up. Sometimes in snippets and often times all the way through. I have seen it over a half a dozen times on Turner Classic Movies. I remember seeing it in my high school English Literature text book. The only screenplay I ever saw in a book about serious literature. Now I finally have a DVD copy of it for my personal collection. I still can't believe it runs nearly three hours. It just never seemed that long.Strange how time is affected when you become involved in a story. CITIZEN KANE always seems longer than it really is; nearly three hours and yet it barely comes in under two hours. THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES is the exact opposite. It seems like it comes in under two hours, but runs nearly three.Go figure.This is an entirely character driven story that doesn't depend on sex and violence to carry the narrative. It could have easily degenerated into soap opera, but somehow never does. The chemistry between the three male leads; Dana Andrews as Fred Derry, Harold Russell as Homer Parrish and Fredric March as Al Stephenson is largely responsible for this. But this is still one of the greatest examples of ensemble acting in cinema because it all seems so ordinary and everyday and effortlessly true to life.The women are also a revelation. Myrna Loy as March's wife Milly Stephenson hits all the right notes as the beleaguered wife, Teresa Wright shines as their bewildered daughter, unwillingly caught in a love triangle between Fred Derry and his wife, Marie, memorably portrayed by Virginia Mayo. Cathy O'Donnell is achingly poignant as Homer Parrish's girl friend Wilma Cameron, sympathetically standin' by her man with no hands.Russell won two Oscars for his moving portrayal as Homer Parrish and I have never been more reluctant to write a spoiler. This time I'll just advise you to see for yourself what his performance is all about. Dana Andrews as Fred Derry gives one of the best interior monologues you will ever see in film and hungover Fredric March waxes eloquent about the rights of the returning veteran.Here is a great place to start dissecting that complex of relationships that make for absorbing drama. There is nothing forced or histrionic about this film. The ending I found resoundingly fitting as everything fell into place. You should easily be able to relate the experiences of your own life to what you see on the screen. Even so, this 'life as it is' version of service men returning home from war will register stirring, vivid images in your mind that will stay with you for the rest of your life.",

            "content": "In the period immediately after the close of the Second World War, motion pictures that dealt directly with combat situations did not tend to do very well, especially with the veterans themselves. The subject matter was still too painful to face up to, not to mention the fact that any inaccuracies or falseness in tone would be grossly disrespectful. Even when dealing with post-war issues there was still a lot that could be got wrong in terms of credibility, respectfulness and relevance. With the Best Years of Our Lives they just went and got everything right.So how do you do go about casting three homecoming war vets at a time when virtually all your audience either was a recently returned vet or was related to one? Do you bring in dedicated professionals who pour everything into a role to totally become their characters? Or do you get familiar character players whom audiences will know and trust, and perhaps see a bit of themselves in? What we actually have is Fredric March, a well-meaning ham who hit his peak in the early years of the talkies, Dana Andrews, a leading man from a handful of genre-movies, but not what you'd call an impressive dramatic actor, and Harold Russell, a genuine disabled veteran with no previous acting experience. But all three turn in perfect performances, from Russell's wordless agonising and pent-up frustration to March's believable and endearing drunk act, and too many other highlights to mention.Why do these three very different performers all work equally well in this picture? Well, firstly they are all intelligent men, able to draw upon their experiences as well as to realise the seriousness of the subject matter. Secondly, these guys have been filmed in such as way as to show off their performances to the best and to make them fit into the story. This is the sort of thing director William Wyler was very good at, and I'm going to ramble on about it at length because it is fascinating but goes unnoticed by most viewers.Now, film convention says that if two characters are talking to one another, you either have the camera to one side, showing them both in profile, or you cut back and forth between them in opposing camera angles. In the opening scene there are a couple of shots where one of the protagonists is talking to someone behind a desk, but Wyler doesn't use either of the angles just mentioned. He just keeps the camera behind the desk, so regardless of which is talking we only see the face of the main character. This way we get to witness both the speech and the reaction of the protagonist, and we aren't distracted by having the face of someone who is little more than an extra brought to our attention. A more elaborate version of this comes when we briefly meet the character Woody Merrill (Victor Cutler), Theresa Wright's replacement date when she is trying to get Dana Andrews out of her head. While it would be difficult and look a bit odd to only show us the back of his head, Wyler is careful to make sure he is never too close to the camera, and that we always see him in profile, never square on. This stops us paying too much attention to him or seeing his emotions. It gives us no chance to sympathise or identify with him, and allows us to believe in the romance between Andrews and Wright.So this is how Wyler stops us getting distracted by the less important players \u2013 but how does he focus us on the more important ones? Again by breaking with cinematic convention. For example, moments such as kisses and embraces are \"supposed\" to be shown in extreme close-up, but Wyler often shows these in long shot. This is because he knows sometimes it is more powerful to show peoples' body language than their facial expressions. Of course, Wyler does use close-ups, as well cutting between opposing angles when two characters are talking, but he uses these sparingly and only when absolutely needed. Whenever he is not using one of these techniques, he generally keeps the camera in one position without cuts, allowing the action to play out naturally. Thus when he does move in to one of these more dramatic angles, it has greater impact, and you really take notice and feel that something is going on.And that is more or less all there is to it. For a picture that is nigh on three hours long, there aren't very many characters and the action only really takes place over a few weeks. And yet it is never boring. In a way it's a bit like another wonderful feature from the same year, It's a Wonderful Life, in that it paints a picture of a world that is so believable and recognizable, and yet seems strangely idyllic, and more like we wish our world could be. I for one wish my world included a bar where I could chat about my problems to Hoagy Carmichael while he played piano. You see, it's a picture that spoke directly to audiences of its time, and can still speak directly to audiences of today.",

            "content": "And to think that the damaged veteran part almost went to pretty boy Farley Granger. Consider what that would have done to the movie's heartfelt appeal. Without real life amputee Harold Russell, the film would exchange real life impact for Hollywood glamour. After all, it's the ordinary looking Russell's coping with genuine disfigurement that lifts the film beyond the merely well done. Granger's a capable actor, but clearly shouts Hollywood in a film dedicated instead to Every Town, USA.The first hour's compelling as the three vets return home to find out how much home has changed and how much they've changed. I like the way the three bond as they meet on their way home. That kind of war bonding can't be duplicated by relationships of civilian life, no matter how sensitively rendered. This part is persuasively written and acted. The second hour deals mainly with adjustments of finding a job, sorting out problems, and settling back into civilian routine. The last hour, however, drifts into standard Hollywood soap opera, except for the one scene showing how Homer (Russell) gets ready for bed. I doubt that such a mundane act has ever been more memorably presented.All in all, the movie's well-acted and non-glamorously staged, as it should be. Of course, the movie's also a revealing time capsule of the post-war period, at least of how film-makers would like it to be. Sure, the movie's optimistic in outlook, but then I dare say that's what the audience wanted following five years of war induced trauma. Above all, it's the occasionally rich human-interest that continues the film's basic appeal, even seventy-years later.",

            "content": "Being one of the most critically acclaimed and important movies ever made, the backstory of The Best Years of Our Lives is arguably just as interesting as the movie's plot. Director William Wyler had served in europe during the war against germany and was dismissed from the military after he returned from a flying mission one day without his hearing. Wyler was very concerned when several days later, his hearing didn't return. His doctors couldn't understand it. He now realized he was in serious trouble and his directing career might even be brought to an end. Best Years is interesting because it's a film Wyler didn't even realize he was going to make at all. By the time filming started, he had a little hearing back, but it wouldn't return fully for the rest of his life. This contributed to him having a hard time on set, since he had to wear a special device to hear the actors as well as telling them what they're supposed to be doing. In the end though, he made the right decision by finishing the movie since basically everyone who saw it loved it. It was widely considered the best film of 1946, and despite being almost 3 hours, it holds your attention the entire time. It's popularity has a lot to do with the fact that it addresses an important issue in america at the time: how veterans returning from europe and the pacific were treated. The movie's plot is somewhat confusing and follows a non-linear style, meaning most parts are told out of order. The movie starts by introducing us to the main characters, of which there are 3. Fred, a former bombardier in the air force during the war, Al, a sergeant in the infantry, and Homer, a sailor who has lost both his hands. The movie focuses heavily on the troubles faced by these men as they eagerly try to resume their former lives before they were sent overseas. For Homer, this is made exceptionally difficult, both physically and emotionally, due to the fact he has no hands. The actor, Harold Russell, actually lost his for real in a training accident involving dynamite, and in the film, Homer is resentful of everyone treating him like an alien each time they see him. Every time someone walks up to him, they have a tendency to ask about his arm hooks and how they work. He doesn't want his disability to define him as a person, and strives to prove to everybody how he's capable of great things despite missing two appendages. Al on the other hand has things just as hard, despite having all his limbs intact. He used to work at a bank before the war, and tries to get back into this business, but it doesn't really work. He resorts to drinking because he thinks it will make his life more tolerable. Fred probably has the most complex story, since he used to serve sodas to people before the war, but is now struggling with PTSD and nightmares about the horrors he lived through in the skies over nazi germany. He eventually finds work selling perfume, and a customer one day says to Homer how america was wrong not to join the nazis. This leads to Fred punching the guy out, and he is fired. To make things worse, Peggy (Al's daughter) starts to be attracted to Fred, since she notices Fred is married to Marie, a girl who does not care about him. Al puts a stop to this and threatens Fred in a bar, saying he'll do everything in his power to stop Peggy from being with him. Marie divorces Fred, and he is once again a drifter. On his way to god knows where, Fred stops by an aircraft graveyard, one similar to the one seen early in the movie. He climbs into a decrepit b-17 bomber, seeming to relive the bad memories of his time in the air force. A guy responsible for breaking up the planes for scrap tells him to get out, and then offers him a job. Meanwhile, Homer gets married to his girlfriend Wilma, who still loves him despite the loss of his hands. Al's fate is left ambiguous, probably deliberately, but it can be assumed he is still married and having a hard time adjusting. This is an incredible movie and a landmark in american history. It does have some sad and depressing parts in it, but ultimately, it's uplifting and it simply had to be made. It shows american audiences a very prominent problem at the time, because even though the war was over, veterans coming home still had to get readjusted to not being soldiers anymore, and this was a not an easy transition. When it started to be shown in theaters across the US, Goldwyn worried audiences wouldn't sit still for it, as it is very long. However, after a wildly successful first screening, there was little doubt the rest of the country would love it, and they did. Interestingly, famous director Frank Capra also threw his hat in the ring in 1946 with the film It's a Wonderful Life, which is considered classic now. Back then, it wasn't that way. At the Oscars, Best Years of Our Lives easily crushed Capra's movie, and stole essentially every single award. Capra was sad since just like Wyler, he had captured footage for use in world war 2 films. He couldn't figure out how to make interesting movies anymore, and retired in 1961. On top of this, he was forced to sell Liberty Films, the company that had produced It's a Wonderful Life. Still, it's not hard to see why audiences preferred Wyler's movie; it's simply much better and more relevant because of its subject. The actors are all great too. Fredric March plays Al, who is struggling to understand his wife and kids after so much time away from them. Dana Andrews plays Fred, who is plagued by nightmares and feelings of dread because of his flying days, on top of having a disloyal wife. Harold Russell plays Homer, a former football player who must live through the unthinkable existence of having no hands. Each main character has his own problems, and they must confront them in different ways. It's up to them. There's also Teresa Wright, Virginia Mayo, Myrna Loy, and Cathy O'Donnell playing the various love interests. In spite of this movie basically killing the career of another director I love, I can't help but be amazed by it. It depicts a very difficult time in american history, and goes to show how war can permanently change a person.",

            "content": "A unique and compelling drama. Unique in that it deals with soldiers returning home from World War 2, and their struggles as they try to fit back into civilian life. Some are physically scarred, and some mentally. Little was known about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder at the time, so the fact that this topic is dealt with so sensitively is quite incredible for the time.This, plus the adjustments they have to make and the fact that their world has changed while they have been away make make for interesting viewing.Compelling too in that it as much a human / relationship drama as an effects-of-war drama. Very emotional, as the servicemen piece their lives back together and try to reestablish / establish relationships, get jobs, etc.Superb directing and camera work by William Wyler. Also a great deal of sensitivity in telling the story. Wyler was involved in the Allied war effort through making documentaries, like the original documentary on the Memphis Belle, so was well aware of what went in to winning the war.Performances are astounding. Dana Andrews is suitably debonair as Fred Derry. Fredric March is a surprise package. His character seems to that of a dull banker but as the movie goes on and on his character becomes funnier and funnier, climaxing in the hilarious dinner speech. March seemed to revel in this side of the role and is great in it.Standout performance, however, goes to Harold Russell as Homer Parish. Russell was not an actor, and was a genuine amputee, playing the role of an amputee. Incredible performance from him, for which he received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, which showed just how much some soldiers sacrificed in the war, and how they carried on without bitterness.Superb female cast too. Teresa Wright is beautiful and wonderful as Peggy. Virginia Mayo is stunningly beautiful as Marie. Myrna Loy provides the gravitas as Milly Stephenson.A wonderful, emotional, sometimes funny, always compelling movie.",

            "content": "I have been meaning to write something on this film for a while and this day seems to be so fitting. I don't often watch a movie that lasts nearly three hours more than once or twice. This is one of the rare exceptions.The story centers on three returning veterans all different generations. Al Stephenson ( Frederic March) is married to Milly ( Myrna Loy ) his daughter Peggy ( Teresa Wright) and son ( not that prominent in the film) welcome his return. Fred Derry ( Dana Andrews) returns to a wife (Virginia Mayo) he really doesn't know . She stopped living with his parents but it's a lot more than that.The youngest is Homer Parrish ( played by real life veteran Harold Russell) he actually did lose both hands in the war and was chosen to play Homer who has experienced the same things . He has loving parents and little sister and devoted fianc\u00e9e Wilma.They meet as they fly to the same hometown and continue to interact afterwards.Homer is self sufficient but not sure about marriage at this point. Wilma remains loyal. Homer's dad helps him each night with the new \" hands\" but will he ever let Wilma? Can he even fully hug her?Al struggles too he returns to his job at the bank as a loan officer. He sees things in veterans that makes him inclined to give them a loan. The GI Bill would ultimately be the answer for many retuning home from the War and help them make a new life . He also drinks more and more. Meanwhile his daughter Peggy who has seen plenty of wartime injuries physically and mentally as she worked with recovering wounded . She gets to know Fred after he crashes at the Stephenson apartment . The three new buddies meet at the same place joined by Milly and Peggy and Fred is too drunk to manage on his own. Peggy is not put off by this . As her mother tells her father Peggy has already seen more than either of them ever will. She sees something in her daughter and is clearly proud of her.The relationship is budding between Peggy and Fred even though he is still married. This worries Al especially when Peggy after meeting Mrs Derry is determined to break the marriage up . She is sure her parents don't understand they have a perfect marriage and life . This may be Myrna Loy's best scene as she calmly but with emotion tells of how you can tell someone you love that you don't anymore and think you really mean it . She explains that love is not always as easy as it looks. Peggy relents she feels terrible and won't try to be a home wrecker. But she doesn't have to as Fred's marriage falls apart with no outside help. This is one of the few mainstream movies at the time that didn't skirt that not all marriages last. Fred also struggles to make a living but eventually finds something that makes sense for many in this post war era . This helps turn things around as he was planning on leaving town.Homer realizes he can marry Wilma when he shows her what it's like to be him and he sees no pity just love in her eyes. He can finally hug her too.Al and Milly attended a banquet where it appears Al may be sliding into alcoholism. In the end one has to wonder if his life will ultimately be the most difficult after the other two get over what seemed to be impossible challenges and hurdles.The film ends at Homer and Wilma's wedding. They all gather to celebrate. Fred is Homer's best man . As Al , Milly and the rest gather around the newlyweds Fred and Peggy are able to talk . They are ready to start their lives together. Fred tells her it will take years for them to get anywhere. Peggy is not put off unlike his ex she is in it for love. She is strong and he seems to appreciate that.This is a beautifully written, acted and directed film that 76 years later doesn't feel dated or poorly aged . The same things affect people today and somehow this film avoided the traps that many films don't.",

She had the nerve to tell him that she wasted the best years of her life while waiting for his return. Actually, she didn't wait, she had Steve Cochran,in a very brief part, to wait the war out.Who can forget that scene when Frederic March returns home and is greeted by his family. Myrna Loy didn't have to say anything. The way she stood there was forever memorable.What did Dana Andrews have to do to win an Oscar? He was so good here as a returning GI but was denied a nomination. March was adequate and was rewarded with a best actor Oscar. I don't know why in a year, when Jimmy Stewart was up for It's A Wonderful Life, did March deserve the accolade.The movie was timely as the war had just ended. Other poignant scenes dealt with Harold Russell, who had lost his limbs during the war, dealing with his handicap.Unlike her undeserved Oscar for Mrs. Miniver, Teresa Wright, who died this year, was effective as March's daughter.",

            "content": "It will not be difficult for me to describe my feelings and thoughts about this film. It is simply the best I have ever seen. Fredric March(the most overlooked of great actors) gives the greatest performance by a leading man ever, as the returning sergeant who was previously a banker. In real life, March was indeed a banker for a short while. Maybe that is part of the reason his performance is so elegant. This movie reaches so many areas of human behavior, by exploring the families reactions to the returning veterans and the later relationships between the men themselves, that it's apparent complexity is in reality the simplicity of the continued struggle for survival. Of course the rest of the cast is wonderful. Including the colorful Hoagy Carmichal as Butch, the local tavern owner, who also happens to play piano. Here's an interesting twist. In one scene Homer (the disabled vet) asks Butch if he remembers how to play \" Up A Lazy River\". After nodding, Butch starts to play the song and while he plays he questions Homer about why he's not at home with his family. Now in 1946, Homer's musical request must have been humorous to the viewing audience because Hoagy Carmichael wrote that song, and the audience must have known it. Carmichael was at the time a big musical star and wrote many famous songs, including \"Stardust\" and \"Georgia On My Mind\" (which was later recorded by Ray Charles) among many others. I have seen this movie many times and only came to the aforementioned conclusion during my last viewing about two months ago. That also brings me to a very important part of this film: the music. It is simply wonderful. I was under the impression (until I recently viewed it) that the music was written by Aaron Copland. Now please exuse me for being a bit tutorial, but Aaron Copland for those of you who are not familiar with the name is considered the first great American Symphonic Composer. Leornard Bernstein, the composer of West Side Story, studied with Mr.Copland. The music for the film was composed by Hugo Friedhoffer, a familiar name in many movie credits of the era. What's interesting here is that the similarity between Mr. Friedhoffer's score and Copland is deliberate. Now whether they couldn't get Copland to write the music and told Friedhoffer to make it sound that way on purpose or whether Freidhoffer did it on his own I know not. Either way the unique sound is typically (by now) and primarily American and this is a story about America. It is what we would now call \"Americana\" This movie is full of emotion. There is great tragedy, humor in abundance, moving music, disappointment, longing for love, peace and security, and even confrontation and violence. It is human in every way. It is the human story. It is wonderful and it is the best, (should I ? oh! why not) \"movie of our lives\".",

            "review_title": "A supremely likable drama, yet worthy of deeper reflection...",
            "content": "I love this film. Hollywood has rarely achieved more compelling - and likable - human drama. This is a glossy and romanticized slice of Americana, yet it tells a powerfully real story. It's got great screen stars - most notably Fredric March - doing some of the best work of their careers. And it has absolutely impeccable direction by William Wyler - so polished that you have to work hard to pull back and actually notice the sophisticated techniques at work.The film's only limitation is one it can't avoid: it's of its time and place. This is a 1946 Hollywood film about the aftermath of global conflict that had only just ended. It's a work that tackles a deeply political topic, from within the period it tries to capture. This inherent difficulty comes through in one subtle way and in one overt scene.The subtle slant comes from what we don't see. For example, we aren't shown the many soldiers who were far worse off than our three protagonists. Homer Parrish does mention that his own shocking disability is actually one of the milder ones he's seen. The film passes this off as casual heroism on his part, when it's in fact all the lip service that's given those who paid a much higher price than this film's relatively lucky trio. All three of whom swiftly find supremely happy endings - surely, not a statistically realistic outcome. This can be thought of as subliminal propaganda, no doubt, but it's mostly just artistic license - a way of sugar-coating some hard truths for the benefit of a war-weary public.The one overt bit of actual propaganda comes in the scene in which Homer gets in a fight with a guy at the lunch counter, who dares to question the political rationale behind the war. If you listen carefully, this man actually says nothing derogatory regarding the troops. Although his manner is made deliberately obnoxious, what he says repeatedly is simply: \"get the facts, learn for yourself.\" An admonition that should never be controversial, in a free society. Yet when Homer snatches away the man's flag lapel pin, the message seems to be that some topics are simply too important to be examined rationally, because, well... patriotism. Once you've spent enough lives, it's no longer acceptable to question whether the tactics were wise or the cause just.We can only hope that this point of view may look a lot more dangerous now, than it must have in 1946. But, to its credit, the film can also be read another way. It does at least hint that the two servicemen are in fact over-reacting. That they probably should question the official narrative, but that their memories are still too painful. Is the scene helping create an attitude of denial... or consciously reflecting upon one that inevitably did exist? I suspect the subtlety is deliberate. Which is the most we could hope for in a mainstream film originating in this time and place.Obviously, any film must be viewed in the context of history. The Best Years of Our Lives must have been a revelation in 1946. A landmark, in going as far as it did in recognizing that the human cost of a war extends far beyond the conflict itself, even for the 'victors.' But today it remains above all a brilliant bit of human drama, a supremely skillful telling of three intertwining stories about characters that are at once noble, likable and credible. It's a film that takes real effort to analyze, simply because it's so overwhelmingly enjoyable.",

The music is very moving and subtle; it really contributes to this fine movie. The two finest scenes for me have not even been discussed yet...The scene where Fred Derry's parents are reading his award citation makes me cry.  I am moved whenever respect is shown and appreciation is given; when there is an understanding of sacrifice and of honor.  (The only similar scene which comes to mind now is that great moment from To Kill a Mockingbird when Atticus Finch leaves the courtroom after having failed to win Tom Robinson's freedom, when all of the black folks in the balcony (plus his own kids) stand to show him respect.) The scene in the cockpit, when Fred Derry is reliving his war experiences. The music takes over and he is overwhelmed with the intensity of the memories.  This scene is big for me because I was a sailor and I did some neat things in uniform and was in on some intense action.  After I left the military, I had a letdown - what is more important that waging war, defending your country and trying to save lives/minimize casualties?  I had to realize that those feelings of contribution and worthiness and importance can never be matched again.  (There are other types of worthiness, like being a dad and a husband - but these are very different.)  Regular life is of a different pace, with more competing responsibilities.  Its all about balance rather than objective.So these two scenes meant a great deal to me when I first saw them and they still do. What a wonderful film!",

Then there was the inimitable Hoagy Carmichael as the saloon piano player, and another bit of inspired filmmaking in the casting of a virtual unknown and actual double-amputee, Harold Russell, who went on to win the Oscar for his first and only big screen role. Even the superb soundtrack by Hugo Friedhofer was in a word, memorable.

I can never forget how Homer arrives home, and how he is greeted, so bravely and so American in spirit. Even thinking about it makes my eyes water. This is a film about bravery, about how to deal with tragedy smartly and with courage. It has humor, it has love, and as I said all the clich\u00e9s that go with it.

This movie contains many notable scenes, the four that touched me most were: when Fredric March starts drinking heavily before his being honored before the bank trustees--I felt myself tensing up, hoping he wouldn't \"blow it\" at the podium, and that's tribute to masterful direction and acting.The second scene was when Fred Derry is told by March to stop seeing his daughter, and when Fred goes to the phone to break it off, you can see him in the back of the bar, talking on the phone, and when he hangs up the receiver, he holds it for a long moment, and that was powerful to see, even though he was in the back of the bar, and a scene was playing out in the foreground, your eyes are always on Fred on the phone.Third is the terror of the plane field full of decapitated war planes, which the director used to mimic the broken psyches of the returning vets who had been tossed aside. Finally, the final scene of the wedding, where Fred reunites with Teresa Wright's character, and you see him from behind, as the best man, and he turns to look at her and she is tearing up--Wyler uses a large hat to help \"funnel\" her face towards Fred's--he turns back to the wedding, and when they go into their wedding vows, he turns again towards her, and they never look away, and when the pastor says \"you may kiss the bride\", and Homer and Wilma share a modest kiss, Fred staggers towards Teresa Wright and plants a kiss of pure unadulterated passion on her, and it's the best scene ever filmed, in my opinion.

Basically the Second World War has ended, and infantry platoon sergeant Al Stephenson (Oscar nominated Fredric March), decorated Army Air Forces captain and bombardier Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) and aircraft carrier airman Homer Parrish (Oscar winning, Honorary Oscar and Golden Globe Special Award winning Harold Russell) are returning home. Before the war, Al was a bank loan officer, and he is returning to his family, wife Milly (Myrna Loy) and the grown up children, daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright) and college freshman son Rob (Michael Hall), but it is obvious he is struggling to readjust to a normal life, and becoming alcoholic. Before the war, Fred was working in a drugstore as a soda jerk, this is the only job he can return to, and he has found out his wife Marie (Virginia Mayo), who he met and married in training before he left, is working as a nightclub waitress. Homer lost both his hands after they were severely burned, so he relies on mechanical hook prostheses, and he knows that his parents and fianc\u00e9e Wilma Cameron (Cathy O'Donnell) are finding it hard to cope and deal with his disability. Peggy meets Fred and becomes attracted by him, and she becomes jealous towards him and Marie, even contemplating breaking them further apart, but father Al tells Fred to stop seeing her, and as a result the two mens' friendship is damaged. Fred then finds out that his wife Marie has been having an affair with another veteran, Cliff (Steve Cochran), and she admits to it saying that she wants a divorce, and with that he decides to leave town, leaving his father with parting gifts, but he does get a new job. Homer meanwhile doesn't want to burden Wilma with his hard life, and he bluntly demonstrates his need for help doing certain things, but she makes him believe she loves him anyway. They agree to get married, and Fred is the best man at the wedding, and Homer and Wilma are very happy, as are Fred and Peggy who embrace their feelings because of his divorce. Also starring Hoagy Carmichael as Butch Engle, Gladys George as Hortense Derry, Roman Bohnen as Pat Derry and Ray Collins as Mr. Milton. The cast all do their parts very well, with March as the character who suffers terrible wartime nightmares, and especially Russell whose real life disability makes his performance both moving and powerful. The direction by Wyler is suitable for the emotional and realistic story, the most compelling of the three men of the plot is of course the poor man who lost his hands, I will admit it could be shorter, it is almost three hours, but all in all it is a worthwhile drama. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Music for Hugo Friedhofer, Best Writing, Screenplay and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Sound, it won the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won Golden Globe Best Motion Picture - Drama. It was number 37 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 11 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 6 on The Ultimate Film. Very good!",

            "content": "It's been a long time since I've seen \"The Best Years of Our Lives,\" and I'm sure I was way too young when I did see it to fully appreciate it, but even then I could tell it wasn't quite like other old black and white movies I was used to.This film came out during a period in which Hollywood was interested in producing socially conscious message movies. \"The Lost Weekend\" addressed alcoholism; \"Spellbound\" addressed psychotherapy; \"Mildred Pierce\" addressed the impact WWII had on the women left behind; \"Gentlemen's Agreement\" addressed anti-Semitism. But these other films were heavy-handed, steeped highly in melodrama, and they seem laughable today, despite their good intentions. \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is different. It's a highly sensitive and understated look at what happened to men when they returned from WWII and tried to acclimate themselves back into the world they left. And remember that this came out not ten years after the end of the war, when historical perspective could safely remove the sting. This came out one year after the war's end! How often does a film, especially from back then, directly address a social concern while it's actually happening.This movie follows three men and their stories. We see Fredric March return to the bank at which he formerly held an executive position, forced to take a menial, secretarial job well below his skills. The pettiness of the civilian world is brought home to him when he gets into an argument with a supervisor over office supplies. We see Dana Andrews return to a wife that he doesn't know anymore, and who doesn't know him. Other war stories show men and their loves pining for one another while they're separated, faithfully awaiting the time when they can be together again. They don't mention that perhaps the strain on the relationship can cause people to fall out of love. And in the film's most uncomfortable storyline, we see a man who has lost both arms trying to deal with being handicapped in a society in which people with handicaps are viewed as second-class citizens. Much has been made of the fact that Harold Russell (who won both a special Oscar and the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role) was not a professional actor, and was handicapped in real life. It's really amazing to think how brave this movie was in speaking frankly about one topic after another that until that time had remained unspeakable.This movie definitely deserves a second look from me, and a first look from anyone who hasn't seen yet seen it at all.Grade: A+",

This movie can also be remembered as the one that beat out another endearing film, It's A Wonderful Life which was nominated for five awards and won none. A great ensemble cast with Fredric March, Myrna Loy, Dana Andrews, Theresa Wright, Virginia Mayo, Hoagy Carmichael, Harold Russell and Cathy O'Donnell.

It portrays various people returning home and how they have to readjust not only to their pre-war lives, but to the overall changing world. Probably the most interesting cast member is non-actor Harold Russell. Having lost his hands in the war, he plays a man with hooks where his hands used to be, and reminds people that he wants to be treated just like everyone else; he went on to win Best Supporting Actor and a special Oscar for the role, making him the only person ever to win two Oscars for the same role.

But number of Oscars doesn't speak much about the movie - people do. And let me tell you this movie is an absolute wonder of the motion picture world; it lasts almost three hours but doesn't feel even the slightest bit long - the narrative goes on smoothly and we get to see the growing of every main character.The movie tells a story of three WWII soldiers who come back to the real world after the war and face the difficulties of adjustment. Lazy description but I couldn't have done it better with other words. The topic isn't outdated one bit; nowadays the soldiers face the same problem all the time, only today they're bound to wanting to get more help from the outside than back in the days when tough men were used to deal with everything all by themselves.The only regret I have about this movie is that Fredric March won an Oscar for it over James Stewart's wonderful performance that year but it is well-deserved anyhow. All three of the main male characters showed their greatest play and this movie will brighten the best years of our lives for sure.",

            "content": "This outstanding 1946 film looks at WWII from a different perspective.  It examines the plight of soldiers returning after the war.  It follows three servicemen who meet on a flight back to their hometown.  The story is well crafted, depicting men from very different backgrounds, each from a different branch of the service and each with a different challenge to face.Fred (Dana Andrews) was a bombardier, a dashing captain in the Air Corp.  He is coming home to a beautiful wife (Virginia Mayo) and no job prospects. His wife loves to party but his job as a soda jerk can't keep pace with her penchant for spending.  Al (Frederic March), a former banker, was a sergeant in the infantry with a wife of 20 years (Myrna Loy) and two grown children. He comes home to a distant wife and a troubled marriage.  He is a banker with a heart, which evokes derisive scrutiny from his boss and the other bankers.  Homer (Harold Russell) was a sailor who lost his hands in a fire onboard ship.  He is returning to his parents and his long time girlfriend Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell) feeling certain that she will never be able to love him with his disability.William Wyler (Wuthering Heights, Roman Holiday, Ben-Hur) is one of the most renowned directors in filmmaking history, having won four Oscars in twelve nominations.  His direction here is superb.  This is a compelling character study with nuance, sensitivity and insight.  The scenes of the uneasy moments of reunion were stirring, especially in the case of Homer, who was tormented and insecure about how he would be accepted without his hands. Wyler takes us right into the most intimate thoughts and feelings of these families as they attempt to deal with challenges for which they are not totally prepared.  The scene where Wilma sees Homer without his prosthetics for the first time is one of the most touching and poignant ever filmed.This is a candid look at the issues of the day.  The film addresses the burgeoning Communist threat and the sense of betrayal at the actions of our former Soviet allies after the war.  It refers frequently to the nuclear threat and the fear of mass destruction.  Most importantly, it shows how difficult it was for servicemen to adapt to a world that had become accustomed to getting along without them.The acting was outstanding across the board.  Frederic March was excellent as the banker trying to hold together a troubled marriage.  He gave a towering performance and won an Oscar for best actor.  Andrews, who wasn't nominated (and should have been), also gave a fabulous performance as the glamorous flyboy who comes home to discover he has no skills and can't get a job.  Harold Russell won a best supporting Oscar for his portrayal of the sailor trying to regain his self-respect after the loss of his hands. Russell actually lost his hands in the service in an explosives accident during a training excercise. He is amazingly dexterous using his prosthetics. His portrayal of Homer had such affability, depth and sensitivity that it is difficult to believe this was his acting debut.This film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won seven including Best Picture, Best Actor for March, Best Director and Best Supporting Actor for Russell.  It is ranked number 37 on AFI's top 100 of the century.  I rated it a 10/10.  For anyone who enjoys a powerful and emotional character study, this classic is a must-see.",

            "content": "This was one of the first films to explore what happened to those soldiers after the war, mainly because it was made the year after WWII was over. Plus it is one of the best of those films. Here we first meet three soldiers returning home, to the same hometown actually, and there their mutual history begins and ends. But even that trip back forms a kind of camaraderie where they want to keep in touch. There is banker Al Stephenson (Fredric March), a middle aged officer, sailor Homer Parrish (Harold Russell, a real amputee) who was the all American boy who excelled at sports and is engaged to the girl next door but now is missing both hands, and Dana Andrews as Fred Derry, a pilot who was just working in a drugstore before the war made him a temporary hero. This role for sure allowed Andrews to turn his stoic tight lipped image on its ear to a degree, as he was allowed to show the emotional wounds that can lie beneath the surface of a \"war hero\" returning home.Their stories all intertwine, especially the story of Fred and Al. The thing that they have in common? Al's daughter, Peggy (Theresa Wright), who falls for Fred. The problem is Fred is married. A bigger problem is Fred was married during the war when he was a pilot with all of the glamour that comes with it to Marie (Virginia Mayo), who doesn't really know Fred at all, and for sure doesn't know him as the pre-war soda jerk who doesn't make enough post-War for her to enjoy the nightlife that she loves so much. As Marie holds Fred more and more in open contempt, Fred finds him turning more to Peggy.Meanwhile, Homer is trying to face facts. He cannot survive without the help of others. He cannot even get dressed and undressed without somebody's help. How can he marry the girl next door or anybody else without being a terrible burden? It doesn't help that the girl next door doesn't care about any of this, but Homer thinks she'll care later.March's character is probably the most fortunate and the least explained of the three returning soldiers. He was a banker when he left, and he goes back to that job, however, this time he is evaluating the loans of returning soldiers as the bank thinks he has their perspective given his time at war himself. Al seems to have a drinking problem which his wife (Myrna Loy) tries to hide, and it is never really said where that drinking is coming from, or if it was there before the war. When Al and his wife see each other, for the first time in years, you can see they don't know quite how to act around one another. Loy and March do a great job - without any dialogue - of acting like they feel like honeymooners, which they probably both feel is ridiculous since they have been married for twenty years and have a grown daughter.There is one scene that I found as quite a surprise, seeing I was born 13 years after the war. A guy at a drugstore diner counter basically says the war was all trumped up for corporate profits, and that it's a shame a guy like Homer paid the price. His remark is met by a punch by Fred. Although that attitude was more common during and after WWI, apparently it was held by a few people in regards to WWII in spite of the overwhelming evidence that our nation was at stake.I'd highly recommend this one. Even though some of the social attitudes have long passed on, it gives you some things to think about that are relevant to today. A spouse can change their attitude towards the other spouse due to a job loss, you never know if a marriage is really a bad one and on the rocks unless you are in that marriage or if it is over, and people are still judged by \"what have you done for me lately\".",

            "content": "The homecoming of three war veterans leads to the reality of altered lives and the inability to communicate the horrors of war in William Wyler's inspired postwar saga, 'The Best Years of Our Lives'. A key ingredient in its huge success was the perfect casting of the leads. Dana Andrews had the role of a lifetime as a bomber pilot who cannot adjust to civilian life, confronted with the realization that his wife (Virginia Mayo) is a tramp and his job situation is hopeless. Fredric March, as a banker, and Harold Russell, as a seaman minus both hands, are followed as they attempt to reunite with their loved ones. Under Wyler's direction, the film emerged as the most honest and unflinching look at the shattered lives of servicemen forced to rebuild their civilian lives while dependent on the help of family and friends. Winner of many Oscars, it certainly merited a nomination for Dana Andrews but he did not receive one. This fine actor was always at his best in his decent victim guise and gave a compelling portrait of a bitter man. A particularly poignant scene has him climbing up into the nose of one of the B-17s in a junkyard, reliving fleeting memories of the war that has changed his life forever.All of the actors do outstanding work--Fredric March (Oscar winner for his role as the banker), Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, Virginia Mayo, Hoagy Carmichael, Harold Russell and Cathy O'Donnell.

            "content": "The perfect Veterans' Day film focusing on that 'greatest generation' of valiant WWII soldiers struggling to return to 'normal' Life after literally making the World safe for democracy.This film was directed by the legendary William Wyler, circa1946 (who also did the hallowed 1959 version \"Ben-Hur\") and the \"Best Years of Our Lives\" was immensely popular at the Box-office in America's immediate post-WWII period and went on to win numerous Academy Awards (in 1947) for Best Picture, Actor, supporting Actor, Director, Screenplay, Music-Score and EditingThe main strength of this film comes by way of its authenticity and willingness to present the more realistic and sometimes disheartening realities faced by Veterans (and former heroes) that have basically sacrificed everything for their Country - but unfortunately don't always receive a hero's welcome when they return home, and do their level-best to just try to 'get-on' with their lives and deal with the basics like holding down a decent job and simply re-acclimating into everyday societyThe cast is excellent and includes much of Hollywood's A-Team at the time: Frederic March (who won Oscar for best-actor), Myrna Loy, Dana Andrews, Virginia Mayo and a novice (but amazingly-talented) actor in his first-role Harold Russell who in real-Life had lost both hands in an explosion during WWII and throughout the film uses his prosthetic-limbs to accomplish just about everything 'normal' hands can do - Russell also deservedly won best supporting-actor for this role.Of course \"Best Years of Our Lives\" was released in 1946 and, therefore still approached the story from a partially 'old-school' vantage point (for example it doesn't directly-explicitly address the more modern highlighted issues of life-threatening PTSD or suicides, etc. although there are moments when some of the returning veterans do re-live/re-experience traumatic WWII flashbacks-nightmares)But you still have to give this film much credit for going as far as it did (for the era) and I think it was the first Hollywood film to show vets with life-altering injuries-disabilities (resulting in losses of confidence that must be regained thru perseverance) and the idea that society did not necessarily welcome all vets back with open-arms and did not always provide opportunities for good jobs-good careers upon return - this is certainly true of Dana Andrews character 'Captain Fred Derry' an 'ace' bomber-pilot who attained the rank of Officer, but upon return can only qualify for the same type of minimum-wage job (i.e. server at a 'Soda-fountain') that he had as a teenager before entering WWII. And Harold Russell as 'Homer Parrish' who struggles to adjust to his prosthetic-hands and delivers the most moving performance trying to remain externally upbeat, but inwardly wrestling with issues of self-confidence that inadvertently cause him to coldly cast-aside his faithful pre-War girlfriend 'Wilma' played by Cathy O'Donnell (at least until Homer can fully come to terms with his new situation/reality and recognize his genuine 'good-fortunes' in Life)This is a truly great film that makes you think about the hardships that nearly all veterans (who witnessed intensive-combat first hand) must directly deal with upon return (whether confronting physical or emotional traumas).\"Best Years of Our Lives\" also makes you realize that even though the ultimate-objectives and moral-imperatives of WWII were crystal-clear and beyond question (I.e. resisting-defeating fascism and directly saving-defending pluralistic-democracy's very existence) returning WWII veterans still did not always receive the full-measure of welcome and dignity from society that they fully deserved = imagine how much more difficult it must be for the veterans returning today?",

Virginia Mayo's performance of a thoroughly unlikable character is also noteworthy. The weakest of the cast are Cathy O'Donnell as Wilma and much worse, Michael Hall as the wooden Rob, but they are easily compensated for by the rest of the players. The story is told beautifully, never over the top or too melodramatic, just very real. Harold Russell's portrayal of a handicapped veteran is quite unusual material for a film of this era, and is done so adeptly that one feels empathy, but never pity, and finally genuine relief when we see that his character will ultimately pass through the torturous adjustment and again enjoy a happy and fulfilling life. Other reviews have outlined the story already, I'll just say this is a film that will not disappoint. You will feel you have been transported back to post-war middle America and are realizing things about it that never occurred to you before. This film will make you laugh, tempt you to cry, and above all, give you cause to think. This is what film-making should be like. 9 stars of out 10, only because nothing is perfect.",

            "content": "More than two generations later it is difficult to imagine how it must have been for the men and women who had so recently won the second World War to come home to an America different from the one they had left behind a few years earlier.  This cinematic classic conveys the atmosphere of that poignant time, and even those born years later will easily identify with the joys and heartaches of this homecoming.During the war years so much of the nation's efforts were put into supporting the fighting men on the frontlines who were, quite naturally, the centre of everyone's concerns.  But with the war over, and with the soldiers back out of uniform, they became once again ordinary citizens who had to make their way in life along with everyone else who had stayed behind.  In many cases their lengthy absence proved a handicap.  Wyler's sensitive direction captures the dilemma perfectly in the lives of the three protagonists.  March is a banker who had left behind a family and returns to find his two children grown and thinking for themselves \u0096 and not always in ways with which he is comfortable.  Andrews is a former soda jerk-turned-bomber who comes home to a crumbling marriage and a wife he barely knows. Russell leaves a fianc\u00e9e \u0096 literally the girl next door \u0096 loses both hands in combat, and, assuming he is no longer lovable, cannot bring himself to accept her unwavering devotion.Although none of the three had known each other before their war experience \u0096 mostly, it seems, because they came from quite different social and economic circumstances \u0096 their lives are now inextricably interwoven.  The principal storyline consists, not of a single main plot with related subplots, as one might expect, but of the three skilfully interconnected subplots themselves, all of which come together in a satisfying way in the final scene.  Under a lesser director this might have turned messy.  But the result here is a wonderfully rich and moving film.I've always liked Teresa Wright, whose characters invariably exude warmth and compassion and make the viewer wish she really did live next door.  One hardly expects such a wholesome person to announce to her astonished parents that she intends to break up a marriage, but she makes it work.  Coming from her it seems like the most logical thing in the world.  Loy too has a way of being both sexy and maternal.  She's exactly the sort of woman a returning GI would want to find waiting for him.Two peculiarities do not stand the test of time very well.  First, nearly everyone in this film smokes.  For better or worse, if North Americans as a whole have become less puritanical about sex, they have become more so concerning tobacco use.  Second, it would seem fairly evident to us now that March's character has an alcohol problem.  If so, one wonders how he got through the war in one piece.  In any event, making light of someone's excessive drinking would not go over very well at the beginning of a new century.When I first saw this film I missed the name of the score composer and thought it might have been Aaron Copland.  Some of the musical phrases and chord progressions seem somehow reminiscent of \"Appalachian Spring.\"  Of course, it was Hugo Friedhofer.  Like the better known Copland, Friedhofer seems to capture well something of both the expansiveness and the ordinariness of the American heartland, but this time in the lives of the three GIs and their families.  The music has a profound emotional appeal without becoming overly sentimental.  It communicates simultaneously a nostalgia for those missed years, the unimaginable joy at being home again, and the bittersweet feeling of trying desperately to fit in and make up for lost time.This is, in short, very nearly a flawless film well worth multiple viewings.",

            "content": "A truly fine picture. So good the real question is, where to begin its praise? First, look at the talent, Wyler as director, a Robert Sherwood script, Myrna Loy and Fredric March as leads? Right there you have the 'A' team. The results should not be surprising.The script is just right. Without illusions but without cynicism. It shows hard truths and true love. It is tight and well paced.The directing is outstanding. The pace and tension of the scenes are spot on. And many of the shots were superb, Wyler getting the camera angle just right, focusing in the key element yet keeping the rest of the scene in play. His control of the lighting is equally good yet so subtle is his command you are hardly aware of it.The acting is first rate. Like any great movie, all characters gave strong performances, although Myrna Loy and Frederic March were superb. Altogether, even in the smaller characters like Fred Derry's parents or 'Spikey', were perfectly cast. Even Hoagy Carmichael, a professional musician, gave a strong, believable performance.This is a very fine picture that remains fresh, meaningful and undated to this day. The sensitivity and deftness with which Homer Parrish's lost limbs are handled is itself a great achievement in both art and humanity. It was a good balance of not only the acceptance of his loss by others, but also the acceptance of himself. And his final belief that others saw and accepted him as he was and not what he had lost.See this film. You won't be disappointed. Only the most callous and hardened heart would fail to appreciate it.",

Nowadays movies so often show the \"good\" characters early on put in certain circumstances (threatened, attacked, betrayed) in order to coerce us to respond to them. By contrast, this movie shows returning man going about his business, and each of the returning characters make the kind of small mistakes that make them more human, more approachable. More than in any other movie I felt I was meeting new friends rather than following a story. Yet the stories themselves are good. This movie is in my top 5. I found it similar to Its a Wonderful Life, which I love too, but less obvious and less overly dramatic. Other good things about the film -- you can learn about the 1940s dress, manner of speaking, sense of humor; the movie has more thoughtful dialogue than two average current movies; the cinematography is excellent, with especially thoughtful character positioning in group scenes; there's a cameo by Hoagy Carmichael.",

            "content": "This movie does an exceptional job of creating an emotional response, one of compassion for what the veterans and other characters are going through. But it takes a certain amount of effort and imagination from the viewer to understand the larger context of what people at that time felt. The soldiers didn't know whether they would ever see their home and family again, and wives didn't know if they would see their husbands again. So when the vets returned, it was not just the emotion of a long time away that they felt.The vets of World War II saved the world for freedom, literally. Their sacrifices and the sacrifices they witnessed around them were what preserved the communities they returned to. This they must have felt, yet those who had stayed behind didn't. We see no gratitude from the civilians. To understand what these WWII vets went through, you need to learn about the history of the war. The audience in 1946 would have lived through that history, through newspapers and newsreels. For the rest of us, there are lots of documentaries covering the war from many angles. It takes time to really dig into the subject, but once you do, The Best Years of Our Lives has much deeper meaning. This is an important movie, one you should see, yet it is not pretentious. It strives for a naturalistic, slice of life approach, though, as some have noted, with a strong romantic twist. But it is more than a romance; it is about the inner turmoil of adjustment, as well as the outer, social and economic challenges. This movie could have been very dark and depressing without the romantic element, which provides a positive resolution to the story. The various plot elements are plausible, such as the right-winger at the lunch counter. Journalist Eric Sevareid wrote about observing meetings of Americans in the Midwest before the war who could only be described as Nazi sympathizers. And the fact that veterans did not get much credit for what they had done when applying for jobs seems accurate; just look at what happened to the heroes who were in the photo of raising the flat at Iwo Jima. We know now there eventually was an economic boom, but right after the war, some figured we would return to a Depression economy. A lot of people were out of work.While the movie stands on its own, it helps to have a sense of the historical period. The Ken Burns oral history, The War, is a good place to start. The BBC also made a multi-part documentary series. Footnotes: Near the end, The Dana Andrews character mentions as a job qualification that he learned to operate the Norden bombsight. I was a little surprised to hear it mentioned in 1946, since it was supposedly secret, even many years later, though not a well kept secret. The Norden bombsight was an extremely complex analog computer that for the last few minutes actually flew the plane to the target. So Andrews did have an extremely complex and important job.The Andrews character was a \"soda jerk,\" who worked behind the counter at a soda fountain, traditionally found at a drug store because of the technical and chemistry background needed to produce carbonated water and keep ice cream frozen in the early days. We see an old fashioned soda fountain, apparently a standard Liquid Carbonic Company model. They were still around in the Sixties, but have largely vanished. The online \"Drugstore Museum\" has some info on soda fountains. The American Heritage magazine ran a fascinating article by Joseph L. Morrison on their history in the Aug. 1962 issue, available online.While Harold Russell's performance was not so polished, it carried great power that lifted this film above the ordinary. He didn't have to act. I liked the quote in Russell's IMDb bio, from his letter supporting President Truman for firing Gen. MacArthur: \"The issue is whether the ultimate civil authority of the United States can tolerate actions in contempt of constitutional lines of authority. Any lessening of civil power over military power must inevitably lead away from democracy.\"",

            "content": "A daring film in an old-fashioned way: rather than flout social convention for shock value, this picture risks absurdity by its very wholesomeness. It lives and breathes Americana and celebrates the most obvious of values. Its greatest asset is blatancy. And yet it is a very, very good movie.\"The Best Years of Our Lives\" succeeds at dramatic hokum that Capra and Spielberg would find difficult. The wedding scene is preposterous: Harold Russell has to put the ring on Cathy O'Donnell's finger, a delicate operation with brutal-looking hooks; she's terrified he'll drop it; her parents are against the wedding anyway; Dana Andrews has his back but he's on the skids himself - and the sailor not only performs, but soothes Wilma's trembling hand with his grim prosthetic. This should not work. This should be ridiculous. But the thrill is genuine, because the trick is delivered with an absolutely straight face. We're watching a moment that is essentially mundane, executed with grace and simple efficiency, and we realize a kind of zen. There is only this moment, and this moment can be beautiful.Beyond its politics, the picture has technical excellence of various stripe, and many of the scenes are so well constructed as to transcend genre and propaganda. The slow rekindling of Frederic March and Myrna Loy's love and faith, from drunken jitters on his first night home to the hopeful center of the movie by the third act, is as human and believable a story as Hollywood had produced by 1946, heroically realized by William Wyler, Robert E. Sherwood and the two actors. The bedroom scenes hum with nervous exhilaration. When March, fed-up and drunk, starts to blunder his way through a business dinner, then pulls off a crashing victory of a speech, it's not just the high-wire act that amazes: it's word, gesture, nuance, angle, a confluence of competencies. This movie is a little like the San Francisco 49ers of the 1980s - everybody's on top of his game, nobody's too flashy, and so the vehicle inexorably gains one advantage after another.Myrna Loy gives one of the choicest readings of a brilliant career, enjoying dialogue that seems written for her alone of all the actresses in the world. March never was more complex and true. Dana Andrews surprises with his range and gravity; the ing\u00e9nues are sweet and sympathetic; and what one might have thought was a sympathy Oscar for Harold Russell turns out to be the reward for a supporting performance akin to the best of Ward Bond, Victor McLaglen or Wallace Beery.",

            "content": "An article in Time (7 August 1944) about the return of injured veterans, provided Goldwyn and his wife with the idea for the film. Accordingly, Goldwyn asked Mackinlay Kantor, a former Air Force correspondent who had been stationed in England, to write an original story based on his experiences. Kantor delivered the result, a 434-page novel entitled \"Glory For Me\", written in blank verse, in January 1945. Goldwyn then handed it to Robert E. Sherwood to use as the basis of a screenplay.After shooting for more than 100 days at a cost of over $2,000,000, Wyler edited his 400 reels to 16 - 2 hours and 52 minutes worth. Even though he was frustrated in his wish to cut it down by a further half-hour, Wyler considered it the best film he had yet made. His technique is faultless: His use of the mirror stratagem re-appears, this time in duet for the comic purpose of doubling the image of Fredric March in the megrims of the morning-after; the window enclosing remote (and now relevant) action can be found in the drugstore sequence where it brackets the managerial office with the busy salesroom below; the sparingly-used close-up has a poignant effect when it rests upon the wistful countenance of Harold Russell or details Teresa Wright's shattered face, caught in a moment of anguish.A particularly impressive episode is Derry's visit to the bomber graveyard - Wyler composes a symphony for this scene out of visual and orchestral effects. The music is excellent, Friedhofer's musical motifs frequently growing out of the scene itself, be it Hoagy Carmichael's piano jingles, Marie's strident radio, or the jungle rhythms of a nightclub band.",

Clocking in at close to three hours, the film has received some criticism about its length, but the ample runtime allows the film to properly flesh out all three protagonists and the camaraderie that develops between them as they meet while sharing a flight back to the same hometown. Fredric March won an Oscar for his portrayal of a banker unable to instantly return to being the shrewd businessman that his colleagues expect of him. Dana Andrews was not Oscar nominated but is equally as effective as a pilot haunted by nightmares of war and vexed by a selfish wife who believes that he could just \"snap out of it\" if he really wanted to. The best performance comes from Harold Russell though, a nonprofessional actor who really did lose his hands during the war. There is a truly heartfelt moment when he smashes a glass window and the film handles his uncertainty over whether his fianc\u00e9e really still loves him very well. At times, the movie edges into melodramatic territory with Hugo Friedhofer's overbearing score no help, but it flows pretty smoothly in general. There also is a lot to like about how Wyler sets the film entirely in the aftermath of the war and yet manages to convey just how much each man is changed by his experiences.",

It stands the test of time as a testimonial to our ability to adjust and accept any burden life throws at us as a country, our spirit is effectively summed up by Andrews' last line in the movie, \"I can learn.\" I understand this was originally made under the independent Liberty Pictures banner (as was Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, which still sports the logo) but was absorbed under United Artists due to the financial implosion of the fledgling company.

            "content": "\"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is a movie from 1946 directed by William Wyler, one of the greatest directors of the classic Hollywood. The film, which takes place in a little town of the USA, is a drama about the problems that several veterans of the Second World War have to overcome when they come back home.The three main characters (Al, Fred and Homer) meet by chance in the plane that is going to take them back home after the war. They live in the same town but they'd never met before. During the journey they share their experiences and they become friends immediately. The rest of the movie we are going to witness how difficult is going to be for all of them to come back to their lives due to the physical and psychological scars that the war has caused to them.Never before have I seen in my entire life such a touching and moving film like this! Everything in it fits perfectly. It's incredibly entertaining and at the same time is absolutely thought-provoking because the characters seen on the screen and the situations they cope with are universal and timeless, thus anyone can feel identified with them. Nevertheless, many would argue that the length of the movie (almost three hours) may be a drawback but I don't agree. In fact, the producers (as usual) organized a test screening before the official premiere, to check what the audience didn't like about the film, but the people considered the plot so haunting and gripping that the producers eventually decided not to modify a single scene of the movie, which is not very frequent.Widely praised by critics and awarded with 8 well-deserved Oscars (including best motion picture), this masterpiece soon became a huge box office success that still remains (adjusting the ticket price to inflation) as one of the most top-grossing movies of all time. I never get tired of watching it and every time I do it I can't help thinking: \"it's a real shame they don't make movies like this anymore!\".\"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is definitely my favorite movie of all time, by far (alongside \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\").",

Everyone of the characters in the movie is paraded by primal doubts, and unable to masquerade a pretense about how nothing was seriously wrong, for the simple reason that it was not true!!! Once sergeants, and generals, and their wives, and daughters, and sons and virtually all other Americans touched by World War II, were exposed to disabilities, nightmares and recriminations of World War II and what it really accomplished as well as negated, nobody was the same!! For now, social and moral issues had a self serving interest...Frederick March and Myrna Loy had to start over!! Dana Andrews realized that he should never have been married to Virginia Mayo in the first place!!! Theresa Wright has become painfully aware of the fact that she is constructively selfish!! Las but not least, the character, Homer, is about to get married and he thinks that everyone around him is as devastated by his injury as he is, basically in the sense that they are unable or unwilling to cope!!The reason this film is so fabulous is because a happy ending was attained the hard way, once everybody recognized the new beginning of the new United States and the new world overall, tragedy from WWII was recognized, and things that were emotionally torn asunder were taken in stride, and dealt with accordingly!! Frederick March and Myrna Loy need to go back to chapter one in their marriage, Homer has apprised his new bride as to what it takes to be married to him (i.e. half the times, she will feel like a nurse) and Thresa Wright's involvement with Dana Andrews means that her entrance into adulthood has resulted in partial responsibility for breaking up a marriage...This is tantamount to learning how to drive a car to get your driver's license at the Indianapolis 500...The characters in the movie are the typical post WWII Americans in that they are stalemated by the rude awakening of coercive changes to their lives...Happiness no longer is afforded the luxury of the adjective cop-aesthetic...it is now about formidable conditions, and good winning out over evil by way of the less ugly choice!!...World War II did not just happen!! It will henceforth dominate the social patterns of American living!!!The aggregate catastrophe of World War II has mirrored most Americans' feelings of personal human inadequacy as well!!I loved this film and so did AFI, probably for the reason that it brought out issues that were at one time unjustifiably taboo!!..Bottom line, see this movie!! Nightmares about combat, dilemmas about marital unhappiness and/or readjustment, coping with your life when stricken-ed by a disability and just basically acting human are portrayed constantly in movies and television today, HOWEVER!! this is 1946!! Very new to Americans then....REMEMBER THAT!! Director William Wyler has illustrated how Americans feel about the aftermath of WWII in the days when the movie industry has left him with one hand tied behind his back!!! Take that into account and you will probably realize just how sensational this movie really was!!",

The character of Homer is my favorite. Harold Russell was no real actor. He had no acting experience until his hands were burned off in combat and then he used that disability to help other service men and accident victims. I think the scene that gets me most is when he's in his room alone and it's night and he's looking at all the photos on the wall of his high school career as an athlete. He was prominent in football and basketball and he was what most people consider 'whole' and now he has only hooks for hands and has to live the rest of his life that way. But although he's the character that would probably be the most likely to feel sorry for himself, he's the one that is probably the most grounded in reality. Dana Andrews' struggle to come to grips with who he was and who he is now is excellent as well. All in all this movie is Americana at it's best with the worst scenarios I suppose you could say.

In a time when movies were heavy on propaganda and looked at life, especially WWII, with rose-colored glasses, this movie adds surprising and refreshing balance.It starts off with 3 veterans. One is a middle-aged business and family man trying to find his place in his old life again, the second is a man with PTSD returning to the young wife he married on a whim and hardly even knows, and the last is a young man returning to his family and childhood sweetheart with a cheery attitude, but a life-altering disability.It's still a bit rosy-eyed, but the subjects it covers are not; disability, PTSD (whether they call it that or not), alienation from your spouse/significant other, alienation from yourself, and the heavy cost of war. And that's just scratching the surface.There's a lot I don't want to give away, but I will say this; this movie went to many unexpected places, and it did so with grace and maturity. This is a joyful movie, but it's also sad and bitter and shows some of the harsh realities of what life can throw at us.Everything about the movie is phenomenal. My only critique is that a few scenes do drag on a bit, but it's still worth it. My favorite part about it is the actress Theresa Wright, who gets a lot of screen time in this movie. Her emotions aren't often stated, but the viewer can read her face like a book during any scene she is in.I wish this movie were better known.

            "content": "\"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is an introspective movie about three veterans adjusting to civilian life after World War II. The film, directed by William Wyler and released in 1946 strikes a significant chord even today. The story follows Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) an Army Air Force Captain, Homer Parrish (Harold Russel) a Navy man who lost his hands in the war, and Al Stephenson (Frederic March) an infantry platoon Sergeant. They meet on their way home to Boone City and each one experiences excitement and apprehension in resuming the life they had before the war. The three veterans have their own personal story. Fred Derry before leaving for the war, impulsively married a showgirl (Virginia Mayo) who turns out is only interested in money and having a good time. Harold and his longtime girlfriend Wilma had plans to marry, but fears she won't accept him with his physical disability, and Al Stephenson returns to his banker's job and a family who has grown up while he's been away. \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is beautifully and poignantly shot by Academy award cinematographer Gregg Toland, famous for films like \"Citizen Cane\" and \"Grapes of Wrath.\" Toland provides in depth wide shots incorporating busy real life activity as depicted in the department store scene where Derry reluctantly returns to work. The scene with Derry in the background of the piano bar as he makes a painful phone call while Homer plays piano (with his hooks) alongside Uncle Buck (Hoagy Carmichael) is compelling. Various film scenes cleverly shot such as the view of the aircraft graveyard gives a sense of irony and tell a deeper story. A strong performance by Theresa Wright as Stephenson's daughter who is in love with Fred Derry, adds to the conflict. Myrna Loy and Cathy O'Donnell round out an excellent cast. The biggest surprise for me was the performance of real life disabled veteran Harold Russell. He gives a sensitive and straightforward performance as \"Homer\" that earned him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" won 8 academy awards including Best Score and Best Picture.",

It had everything: a great story, an incisive director (William Wyler, whose other credits include \"Ben Hur\" and \"Roman Holiday\"), cinematography by Gregg Toland, and a cast to die for (Fredric March, Myrna Loy, Dana Andrews, Teresa Wright and Harold Russell). Although the movie was made sixty years ago, the subject it deals with is sadly relevant today: the readjustment problems of returning war veterans. Three men have to overcome their inner demons: Al Stephenson (Fredric March), the wealthy banker, has difficulty returning to his comfortable life after enduring the horrors of jungle warfare; Fred Derry (Dana Andrews), the ex-Air Force bombardier, is now just another working stiff with a bimbo wife and an uncertain future; and sailor Homer Parrish (real-life amputee Harold Russell, who won a well-deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar) is afraid to face his fianc\u00e9e with hooks. Fortunately, each man has an understanding woman to help him through his transition: Al's wife Milly (Myrna Loy), daughter Peggy (the wonderful Teresa Wright) and Homer's fianc\u00e9e Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell). This movie is a genuine piece of Americana, and one only hopes our current generation of combat vets will find the same love and understanding.",

            "content": "It is incredible to believe that tens of millions of 18-35 year old men(single and even many family men) left their home to travel thousand of miles away for many years to fight a war that affected the Continental USA not at all and Europe, Asia, and Africa far more. They gave up jobs(not that it was a booming time), girls, and family to fight and in 400,000 cases die, without complaint and in many cases never living to see what we consider normal life passages. Frederic March looks a little too old to have fought, but his presence and family provides a window into the business and romantic world of the post World War II era. Dana Andrews is a little old but still fantastic as the guy who gets kicked in the teeth but in the end prevails. Harold Russell is as natural as a new snowfall- most people at that time talked in a simple monosyllabic manner. Teresa Wright is magnificent, and I agree with Larry King that the ending kiss is the most romantic ever; probably a function of the time. Everyone else plays their role to a T; Andrew's father and (I guess) stepmother smoking like chimneys while sitting in a shabby apartment reading the citation from General Jimmy Dolittle with their voice cracking is incredible(I imagine that would be like getting a letter from Tom Brady or Simon Cowell now). And don't forget about the airplane graveyard sequence Corny, yes but maybe it was a corny time. If you have a chance please watch this- it is 3 hours well spent. It is hard to believe that EVERYBODY from this movie is dead now.",

Because it is lean and thorough in revealing the numerous layers of personality to our three key characters, piece by piece, which makes them so real in a paced and timely way that sets up scenes to punctuate and surprise as it allows us to fully appreciate the depth of their individual struggles that must be overcome. IT is a great example of character development; portrayal within the given story context; and resolution delivered in a surprisingly believable way. It does this without any violence (except one scene of a man being duly punched); without any overt sex, and without any profanity. Merely the use of human interaction to all the key emotions of personal suffering, tragedy, fear of the unknown, pride, dignity, love and hope, as well as empathy and sympathy framed in the simplest but most memorable locations that harvest such believable dialogue which pulls us along with each of their lives until all three resolutions come together.",

            "content": "It's easy to see why this film was the best picture winner of 1946. It is meaningful, epic, and heartwarming. The Best Years of Our Lives tells the moving story of three World War II veterans who return home from the war and realize that life has drastically changed since they left. They are forced to cope with the new lifestyle that they have been so far from, and resituate themselves in unfamiliar territory. The film paints a striking picture of post-war life for veterans. It is critical but remains patriotic and triumphant towards the issues it presents. I wouldn't call this a dark film, but it's no picnic either. It's a human film that brings to light the realism of the situation as best it can.The Best Years of Our Lives starts strong and then sort of goes downhill for me. It begins with tearful reunions as the three main characters return to their families who haven't seen them in so long. Changes in their lives are immediately noticed and addressed and one theme of post-war change is introduced after another. The beginning of the film does a fantastic job addressing these subtle things without outright saying them. There is a lot of room for interpretation in the beginning of the film that sets the stage for a deeply powerful film. The whole first hour of this three hour film wonderfully set up an intriguing set of ideals the film would address. It was all done with a plentiful helping of eloquence that struck me as very unique for a film from its time.But as the film went on it morphed more and more into just a typical romance. The post-war elements still lingered and were still borough up from to time to time, but the overall focus of the film really started to switch to romances between the characters. I couldn't bring myself to enjoy this nearly as much and so the film ultimately grew dull and boring in my eyes. The story presented was well thought out and well executed, but didn't go the direction I had hoped it would. I was disappointed to see some great elements raised in the first half of the film all but go down the drain in the second half when The Best Years of Our Lives transforms itself into a tale of romance that we've all seen too many times.Overall I wasn't crushed by the films change of pace and I can really say that I liked the film. It is very well made and deserved its best picture Oscar. It isn't exactly my cup of tea so I didn't enjoy it as much as someone who loves old romance films would. I can respect the film for its integrity and talent, but it's not something I would sit through again.",

            "content": "TBYOOL is a courageous, valiant and unostentatious attempt at presenting the aftermath of the Second World War from the viewpoint of three war veterans \u2013 an bombardier general, a Naval crew member and an infantry platoon sergeant as they re-acclimatize with their old surroundings that they were deprived of during the War period. The three men's lives interconnect after they ride on the same plane back home; the rewarded bombardier named Fred Derry (Dana Andrews), who received almost four times the income that he used to as a soda jerk before the war, returns to his ordinary life and toils to make a respectable living, while Homer Parish (Harold Russell), an ex-footballer loses his hands and has to rely on mechanical hook prostheses; his defect makes him embarrassed and conscious about how his family and friends would perceive him. He also worries that his childhood fianc\u00e9 would reject him because of his condition. Al Stevenson (Fredric Marsh), a banker in his late 40s deployed as an infantry platoon officer returns to his family, but finds difficulty in retaining his old self to connect with those around him. His wife Milly (Myrna Loy) seems bemused by his changed behavior, and his strange craving for alcohol. The three men, coming from different backgrounds, develop a closeness that spreads to their families and forms new relationships. Fred Derry, who had just spent some days with his newlywed Marie (Virginia Mayo), begins to realize her changed attitude towards him and position. The moment he enters, she comments about not being dressed appropriately for the occasion, and then admires the epaulets on his chest. She quits her job at the nightclub and now completely depends on her husband for their living without understanding that her husband can't fetch the income he used to while at war. During one of their exchanges, she comments rather offhandedly about how her husband had bad dreams about war at night. \"Forget about it!\" she says casually, while continuing to act as a spendthrift. Fred receives more empathy from Al Stephenson's daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright), and they eventually become close. Al Stephenson rekindles the paused relations with his wife and children by taking them to various entertainments. At bank, he becomes humane towards his clients, and judges them intuitively. Homer becomes reclusive and distraught, but is more open when he meets his two chums. When these men return from war, they abandon their new family \u2013 their fellow soldiers. Just imagine the breadth of anticipation in these people \u2013 leaving their families for war, and returning to their families by leaving another family during war. There is a chill, a sense of fervor when this happens - when you leave your families for a short holiday, you start thinking of them and getting homesick. These people would've had the sensations for a while, and then they would have to form new relations with the ones around them now. This atmosphere is lusciously felt among the three actors as they take their flight back home. Their journey is very well written and acted, especially by Russell. When they land, they go home one by one and the reactions from the family are deeply touching, especially when the Homer's mother lets out a stifling cry; I was deeply moved.I have to say the direction here is very different and modern compared to other films of the same period \u2013 there is not a moment of showiness and everything remains grounded to reality. There is an abundance of casual talk and the flow of the dialogs and scenes is never turbulent. You can hear a very dulcet music played during the scenes (which I did not favor though) and the only truly tense moment is at Butch's place later in the film. Now, I shall actually tell how I felt about the movie or rather how I perceive the movie's popularity:TBYOOL was made in 1946, a crucial moment in world history. The growth of post-modernism during the period gave rise to films depicting war moments and the aftermath of it. Therefore, I feel that this movie is culturally and historically relevant in the sense that America needed such a film to be made at that time. It was reflective of the political, commercial and human conditions in those times \u2013 look at Dana's face when his character enters the supermarket only to find it taken over by some other company. Observe how the camera never gets too close to the actors \u2013 it wants to document life through film and it succeeded in that way. William Wyler himself stated that Mrs. Miniver depicted war in a subdued way and after his own war experience; he made this film which never over-sentimentalizes. At times we feel these weren't actors and were real people being documented; only the romantic angle gives it a movie-like feeling. For me, an Indian teenager, it was somehow difficult to truly love the film as it was made for an age that I haven't witnessed \u2013 Mrs. Miniver, which had more dramatic elements, was more liked by me because I expected drama. Here I got the unexpected \u2013 an effort to show truth. The ensemble did a fine job of carrying the story. I think William Wyler wanted to highlight the importance of the story more than the performances of the actors \u2013 which though imperfect was honest. It could have been better acted with a better cast, but that may rob the credit of the story. Hence, I won't grumble much about the stiltedness in the performances at times. But I do bring attention to the mysterious disappearance of Al's son, who left to school forever perhaps!TBYOOL would've made a great and long mini-series had it been released now. The passing of time in the plot requires some more real-time to connect both with the story and the characters. But bravo to it's groundbreaking attempt at mirroring lives!",

If anything, though, this confirms that the principal characters are too little flawed and that the whole thing is a little preachy.  The views embodied in the script, that war is terrible and that sacrifices are needed from all in the recovery process, would have been prevalent in the 1940s.  They still stike a chord with me but they do age the film.  Still the best ever in my opinion.",

Noting the year of release (1946), and the subject matter, (veterans returning from WWII), I was half-expecting a dated classic, which would stand up as a piece of historical interest, but not really place high on the enjoyable scale. I'm pleased to say that I was way off base. This turned out to be a film chock-full of outstanding performances, wrapped around a script which took its time unfolding.  It followed three veterans returning from the war with relative degrees of success.  Each had his own set of problems to deal with while readjusting, and each dealt with success and failure in their own ways.  I found myself actively rooting for each character to come through, even though I typically am hesitant to embrace Hollywood style happy endings. Scores a 9 / 10.

Where these days, PTSD's a word everybody knows.What's old school here is the homespun American value system. We're plunked back to a time when families actually had white picket fences, sat down for Sunday supper, and hoofed it up down at the dance hall.Here we meet middle-aged couple Milly and Al Stephenson (Fredric March and Myrna Loy). He's returned from the battlefield with a bent for drinking too much, and Milly seems too genteel to point it out. Her angelic profile is leavened a bit when she gives daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright) some straight talk about how there had definitely been times they doubted their marriage would survive.Then there's Homer (Harold Russell), who's gotten back from sea with prosthetic hooks in place of hands. He's so afraid of being rebuffed by his girlfriend, Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell) . that he tries rejecting her first. I liked the way that Wilma stuck around, refusing to take the snubs at face value.Best of all, we have Fred (played by a drop-dead-gorgeous Dana Andrews), whose marriage to sexy, vapid Marie (Virginia Mayo) is flaming out. Fred's contributions as a bombardier have done nothing to equip him for a job on Main Street, and he gets some guff from dummies who sell him short.Fred's immediately drawn to clever, wholesome Peggy, and I was a little surprised he took her dad Al's inappropriate slap-down. C'mon, man, tell the old guy to fix his own problems!Such quibbles fall aside in the romantic final frame. Now that's something that'll never go stale!",

Each must adapt to their new lives which have been forever altered by their war time experience. The film is now over fifty years old but its story and message is just as new as when this film came out. Two of the three G.I.'s future seems somewhat secure. Frederic March as Al Stephenson an Army Sergeant returns to his family although a little changed due to the natural process of maturing regarding his children. He returns to his job in a bank and even though he is hitting the booze a little the viewer gets the feeling that he will settle down in time and because of his war experience will be a better man for it.    Harold Russell himself a wounded veteran portrays Homer Parrish a Navy veteran who lost both hands during a sea battle.  He will be provided for financially by a disability pension and even though his life will never be what it was before losing both hands the viewer also gets the feeling that he will make out in time.  Then there is the Dana Andrews character Army Air Force Captain Fred Derry the only officer of the three.  He was nothing more than an attendant at the local drug store soda fountain before his country called.  He now returns to his hometown an Officer and a Gentleman and decorated war hero.  Sadly that's about all he has going for him.  This was the one character as I watched this film and thought `Now this guy would have been better off to have stayed in the service'  Of course he probably for the purpose of the story had been forced out due to man power cutting. \n  I found his plight the most interesting.  He looks full of confidence and intelligence in his dress uniform but when he steps out of it and dons civilian attire he resembles nothing more than a down on his luck schmuck. Perhaps no other actor during the time this film was made could have pulled that off except Dana Andrews.  He gives every indication that he will be come one of  many WWII veterans who returned to their hometowns and found life boring and mundane compared to the 100% life living experience of being in the military during time of war. Eventually many would wind up hanging out at the local American Legion or VFW posts knocking back the booze and reliving perhaps for many literally the best years of their lives.  The triple story line is handled very well with their paths crossing during the course of the film.  Romance, marital woes even a brief questioning of America's involvement in WWII  are also included in the picture.  A story such as this would never have been told on the silver screen before or even during the war but it showed that films were changing in both content and depiction.",

It contains several of the most memorable moments in film history, first rate performances by virtually the whole cast, one of the great scores in movie history, and a story that perfectly reflects the post war years. The atmosphere is achingly real, of the hope and emptiness and uncertainties, of the difference in generations and experiences, and of the changes in the United States. The Best Years of Our Lives presents the Post War Era and its personages so intimately that you feel something for every one of the characters. This is, obviously, one of my favorites and I recommend it as highly as any movie ever made.",

It may seem like a simple film at first glance because of the story as we follow three soldiers returning home, to their city, after World War II and how they fit into the new / old situation, but the film is so layered and deep. It lasts a full three hours, but the film is not at all boring or slow because every scene is important, every shot has its own meaning and tells us something. It only took five minutes for the film to buy me, and after fifteen minutes I was already completely inside the store. The film didn't age at all even though it came out 75 years ago, except perhaps for some obvious things like the paycheck at the time. Although we follow three soldiers who have a lot in common (they return from the war to their home, to the same town), each of them comes from their own special situation and also returns to their unique situation. Each of them is an individual, a unique person and lives in their own, unique situation and family. Their lives have changed irreversibly and we are following this through this film. We can clearly understand everyone's situation because the director did a great job, and the camera is also great because of a few memorable scenes. There is no unimportant shot in this film, I think that achievement is very rare in the world of film. Finally, I would like to mention that this film won a total of 7 Oscars including important for the film, director, lead actor, supporting actor and screenplay. However, there is another interesting thing. Harold Russell received an honorary for supporting role in this film for inspiring all war invalids in America because he was a true war invalid, but he also won that \"ordinary\" Oscar for supporting actor making him the only actor in history to win two Oscars for the same role.",

I love these people and their inherent decency, and I love a country that was once able to produce such people. It is about three men who have become strangers to their own lives, who are quite different men than when the course of their lives had first been set. They left to protect the country and the people they love, but have returned as different men to a country and loved ones who are different as well. As they remade themselves into the soldiers their country needed them to be, they must now find the strength to remake themselves back into the citizens that are needed now. It is about the sometimes extreme courage needed to face every new day, and the heroism needed to do the right thing under quite ordinary circumstances. It is also very much about kindness, acceptance, and the way that we adapt to each other, and try to adapt to the needs of those we love. It shows the ways we sometimes fail each other, imperfect beings that we are, but keep trying.

            "content": "The Motion Picture Academy honored the World War II era with Best Picture honors for films that explored unique perspectives of the war each year from 1942 through 1946 (with the exception of 1945). In 1942, it was \"Mrs. Miniver\", about a family surviving on the home front. In 1943, \"Casablanca\" dealt with the seedy underbelly of the black market, and how it was used to transport people persecuted by Nazi Germany to the United States. In 1944's \"Going My Way\", it was more indirect; a young man seemingly goes half-cocked, marries a singer, then leaves for duty. And finally, we have \"The Best Years of Our Lives\", a tribute to veterans and what became of their lives once their tours of duty were finished.Dana Andrews stars as Fred Derry, a captain in the U.S. Army Air Corps who is returning to his hometown of Boone City. On his way, he meets a sailor named Homer Parrish (Harold Russell) and an infantry sergeant named Al Stephenson (Fredric March). Each man has a different perspective of their home town, as well as unique experiences from the war, even though all three served in the Pacific Theatre. And all three men bear their own scars of the war.Though, like most films from Hollywood's so-called \"golden age\", this movie does have a \"Hollywood ending\", it isn't contrived here. The script by Robert Sherwood works well, and the performances by all the cast not only express the torment of men trying to fit back into their old lives, but also of their families and how they coped (or didn't cope) with them.This movie is among William Wyler's best, and it would be the second of three Best Picture winners that he helmed in his career (\"Mrs. Miniver\" and \"Ben-Hur\" were the other two). It stands as a testament of among the best films Hollywood has to offer. As I have said already, the entire cast worked well together in this movie, one of the best examples of ensemble casting I have ever seen. But I give a special salute to Harold Russell, who plays the disabled sailor who just wants to be alone. Russell never considered himself a professional actor, and he had very few dramatic roles (mostly after 1980), yet the Academy deservedly bestowed him with not one, but two Oscar statuettes for his portrayal of Homer Parrish. I will not mince words here: Russell's performance is quite moving.\"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is a film of rare breed. I say this because not many films explored the lives of military personnel after their experiences in war. There have been a few more recent examples, like \"Coming Home\" and, in a lesser sense, \"Courage Under Fire\", but this was among the first. It is a moving example of film-making at its best.",

I agree with so many of the prior comments.The film's appeal - represented early on by veteran Harold Russell - is that this is going to be a *realistic* depiction of post-war comings home. Mr. Russell, Mr. March, and Mr. Andrews make a great team, and each give great performances. Russell is an amputee, March has an alcohol problem, and Andrews shows some post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. The film shows them adjusting, or not adjusting, to civilian life.Myrna Loy is wonderful to watch\u0085 especially, her eyes. The background/foreground action is nice. I noticed that March and the others do not look like they've missed all that much shaving, despite the script. In fact, March's moustache looks very neatly trimmed.My only criticism is, after starting as a \"realistic\" drama, the film ends with a glossy \"happy ending\". The servicemen's differing problems are all too conveniently... gone. The movie becomes less a realistic drama and more a Fantasy Hollywood Movie. It becomes way, way too sentimental.It's, still, incredibly well-presented sentimentality.I think its closeness to the actual war being represented both adds and detracts from the film. I'm sure audiences benefited from this movie greatly during release - but, it was too soon for an honest reflection.Instead of it's goal, I think the film becomes an essential *American* time capsule. It shows the mood of the country in a way, today, the filmmakers were perhaps not expecting - and, it's sentimentally perfect Hollywood ending is no less valuable than gritty real life dramas. ********* The Best Years of Our Lives (11/21/46) William Wyler ~ Fredric March, Dana Andrews, Myrna Loy, Harold Russell",

Harold Russell won a Supporting Actor Oscar for his work (the real-life veteran lost both hands in combat), and his journey, though rendered a bit stilted by his inexperience as a movie performer, is indeed very memorable. Other Oscar wins included William Wyler as Best Director; keen-eyed Fredric March as Best Actor (although Dana Andrews here is just as solid); a second, special Oscar for Russell for his inspiration to the country; and, predictably, as Best Picture of the year.

            "content": "Spoilers herein.This treacly story hides some masterful filmmaking.Film is all about observation, except the observed usually contrive to make the observer feel unobtrusive.During this period, intelligent filmmakers were playing with the form so that often films were not only engineered observations but the matter of the movie itself was about observation.In this case, we have two acts. The first act introduces our three returning guys: one each Air Corps, Army and Navy; one each enlisted, non-com and officer; and -- so far as the conventions would allow -- from three different social strata. The central scene in this act is them observing the world (and particularly the everycity Boone City) from the nose of a B-17. It is then mirrored by the observations from the cab.Then we enter the film proper which is about three women as observers of these men. We observe a story about three women observing their stories. As the men are equally spaced, so are the observers. Each woman is a different type of observer:We have the quietly engaged observer (Milly), who appears to simply sit by, but who actually influences the action; the passive observer (Peggy) who forces the action to come to her as most movies do. That final scene where Fred watches her watching and them goes over is classic. And we have the Orson Welles type (Wilma) who actively engages in the action, driving the story and literally becoming its hands.I'm usually not a William Wyler fan. His \"Dodsworth\" was a real trial. He had worked with Gregg Toland a half dozen times before, but here is the first collaboration since \"Citizen Kane.\" Toland by this time knew how to manage narrative within the staging. There's a really fine scene for instance where The wonderful Butch and Homer (catch the name) are playing piano. Al is in the foreground and splits his time glancing back at Fred on the phone. This particular scene was the template for the opening of \"The Color of Money\" where Paul Newman is well into a complicated sell job with a barmaid but listens to Tom Cruise cracking balls behind him.The staging is helped by having all the sets smaller than normal so the people pop out.A side note: you might want to visit Tucson some day. There are thousands upon thousands of obsolete -- and some not -- warplanes parked out there in the desert. It is a sobering experience, that.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",

There were hardly any flaws, no lapse in taste or judgment.  A beautiful woman abandons her husband because he cannot make enough money. The most poignant moment was when a former bomber pilot now working as a lowly salesman visits a junkyard in which hundreds of planes are being recycled. The contrast between his former glory and current ordinariness is heart-breaking. There was a good dose of preaching, but the film is so well-mannered one delights in it.

The other actors give excellent performances as well.As other reviewers have mentioned, the issue of disability is also brought up in this movie-another rarity for an old movie. (Heck, a rarity even for a modern one!) This calls to mind the true costs of war, which are brought up both in their physical and psychological aspects. But, this is NOT an anti-war film. It is a realistic portrayal of the proud members of America's \"greatest generation.\" All in all, I highly recommend this movie, particularly for younger people how may benefit from an appreciation of what the older generation did for us all.

It shows the aftermath of the war, which was the most dramatic.  For instance, Al Stephenson (Fredric March) doesn't want to return to his position at the bank.  He also drinks heavily.  And Homer Parrish (Harold Russell) tries to adjust to his life after losing both arms at the elbows. He doesn't want anyone to pity him, and he doesn't trust the love of his before war sweetheart Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell).  Fred Derry (Dana Andrews), married a flashy girl (Virginia Mayo) he barely knew while he was in the war.  She was just impressed with his uniform, and wants him to wear it even after he's discharged.  So Fred turns to the comfort of another girl (Teresa Wright).This movie tells the story of three men (Homer, Al, and Fred), who meet on a plane going home, and who try to adjust to post-war life.  It's sweet and very moving.  Although all the actors are brilliant, I think the best are Myrna Loy, who plays Al's wife, Millie, and Oscar winners March and Russell. I think Russell is especially good, because he wasn't a \"real\" actor.  He was a guy who lost his arms in the war, and he literally plays himself in this.  If I didn't know that he wasn't an actor beforehand, I wouldn't have been able to tell.  He shows the talent of March and Andrews, and of some of the best actors ever in cinema. \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is so unique and wonderful, that everyone really must see it!

The world, following WWII, has changed them and notwithstanding physical and emotional traumas, it has changed them for the better. They are men united by service to a great cause, a just cause and the right cause. Having given so much of themselves they wish to see a better world on their return after victory.Particularly at this time in 2004 that message resonates loud and clear to me. Another just war is taking place and the US and UK are again present, together, in the service of freedom and democracy. Let us hope that when victory is achieved that the world will also be changed for the better.For me, Fredric March's portrayal of \"Sarge\" is so right that it should be considered among the great movie portrayals of all time! All in all a marvellous film, that deserves to be seen again and again.",

A lot more. Too bad they never made a sequel, but then again, why? The film itself is simply P-E-R-F-E-C-T! The cast is wonderful, the music score is stirring and the pictures and screenplay are flawless. I'm sure that most of the other 130 plus reviews say just about the same thing, but I just couldn't help writing a review of my own. The movie is THAT inspiring. \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is probably the finest example of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts. Taken individually, any single scene on it's own would be dreadfully boring. Taken together, they're more than magnificent. From the moment you're introduced to a character, you bond with and care about them. You gain this incredible feeling for their welfare, as if they were actually living, breathing people. I hope that there will always be room for film's like \"The Best Years of Our Lives\". As I said, once it's over you wish there was more to come. It leaves you with a tremendously warm feeling inside. If you've never seen it and are actually reading this to help make up your mind, GO SEE IT NOW! It will be The Best Three Hours of Your Life ever spent watching a movie.",

Russell, who lost his hands in a dynamite accident, famously wins an Oscar for his unadulterated rawness in his first feature film, a sympathy vote too since the sight of Russell ambidextrously using his two mechanic hooks alone is a marvel itself. March also won an Oscar, his second trophy for fleshing out Al Stephenson's conundrum and spirit, he can be jocose, rambunctious, chummy, patriarchal, self-serious and surely knows how to deliver a speech with orotundity. But it is Andrews who stands out among the triad, his Fred has the most complex hurdle to overcome, and Andrews bestirs himself stoically but also viscerally, his square-jaw steeliness strains to keep a lid on Fred's frustration, anger, desperation, or whatever emotion smoldering underneath his tough-guy surface, to the point he registers something far more moving and authentic, a wounded sense of integrity.\"read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, please google it, thanks.",

            "content": "America's love letter to servicemen returning from the war, speaking their truths, and hoping to earn them more appreciation, understanding, and patience. From the beginning we feel something is altered these guys (Frederic March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell), starting with Russell's dramatic reveal of missing his hands, and continuing on with all of their difficulties readjusting. In some sense they seem to be misfits in a country that they fought for and saved, and even though they are widely shown some level of respect, at times it feels like lip service, and that the country was ready to move on just a little too quickly.In ways that are not heavy-handed, the film touches on things that survivors of the war faced, like marital problems, having missed children grow up, alcoholism, night terrors, survivor's guilt, the difficulty of getting a job or a loan, and in one scene, putting up with a loudmouth who questions why they fought in the first place, and didn't just put America First.There are several touching moments: a father reading his son's commendation, the one the young man would just as soon throw away. March's sharp speech defending giving loans at risk to soldiers, cleverly pointing out the risks they took doing things like taking a hill during the war (they couldn't say \"no collateral, no hill\"), and that the bank was betting on America's future. Andrews walking out into a graveyard of scrapped war planes, and climbing up into one. And lastly, Harold Russell showing his girlfriend his body and making sure she understood the limits of his situation.Russell is simply a revelation in this film and deserves special mention out of the strong cast - and I mean that because of his acting. He brings an earnestness and authenticity to the part across a full range - stoicism, dignity, friendly camaraderie, grief, and anger.Three of the female characters are absolute saints (Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, and Cathy O'Donnell), and almost too saccharine sweet in their wholesomeness. When Andrews says to Wright, \"I think they oughtta put you in mass production,\" he's probably got it right. Part of all this was undoubtedly the Production Code, and part of it was meant to impart a lesson in kindness and understanding of soldiers returning with physical or mental damage. They are offset a little by Virginia Mayo, the bad girl who shakes her hips while wrapping a scarf around her behind and soon tires of not living the high life on her husband's small salary. Per the morality of the Code he's expected to stick with her despite loving Wright, because as Myrna Loy's character articulates it to her daughter, in a marriage you go through trials and tribulations and even hating the other person, and are expected to just get through it. Of course all of the badness is assigned to Mayo's character, who conveniently exits the scene to ensure things will play out happily.While the film touches on the darker aspects of returning from war, it's also got that bright, squeaky-clean 1950's American feeling to it, and could certainly have been darker. At the same time, it initiated the conversation on these issues, and it almost certainly helped people heal, and for those things it deserves the credit it's received over the years.Lastly, I liked the foreboding touches that occurred early on, alluding to the horrifying new era mankind had entered. As a high school boy has learned from his physics teacher, \"We've reached a point where the whole human race has either got to find a way to live together, or else...\" The point is later echoed by a piano player in the bar (Hoagy Carmichael), who is advocating patience to Russell's character because he's struggling. He softly says some of the best lines in the movie: \"You know your folks will get used to you, and you'll get used to them, then everything will settle down nicely. Unless we have another war. Then none of us have to worry because we'll all be blown to bits the first day. So cheer up, huh?\"",

I assumed it was going to be painfully schmaltzy and didactic.Boy was I wrong. It's really an excellently constructed film. Sure it's still a \"Hollywood\" version of reality, but far more than most films (even today) this one is willing to deal sort of honestly with post-war conditions. Things aren't hunky-dory just because the war is over, heroes aren't perfect and don't become so. Adults clearly want to have sex and do.

It was a truly great film when it was released in 1946 , a fact reflected in its massive box office draw and awards . There's two things producer Samuel Goldwyn , director William Wyler and screenwriter Robert E Sherwood are saying with this film : The first thing is the sons , brothers , fathers and lovers who went away to fight in the war are not the same men who came back . The young men who fought and survived haven't in fact survived at all . They have more or less the same physical attributes but the war has killed part of them The second thing is to tell the men that home no longer exists . The civilian population might have watched the newsreels of the war but they don't owe you anything . Try not to be too bitter about that These themes run throughout the film some obvious , some latent . The most blatant example is Harold Russell as Homer whose casting sears itself in to the memory which is an image which the film is correctly remembered for . There's also the scene in the pharmacy with Homer and the \" American patriot \" which sums up the insanity of real politic in the new cold war where a year ago the Soviets were brothers in arms but are now the enemy . An audience growing up post 1945 might have very well forgotten that a long time ago the Soviets were the good guys You must watch this empathising with an 1946 audience to get its full benefit and whilst it remains a good there's a couple of elements that stop it remaining a great one . First of all there's an overuse of intrusive melodramatic music that dictates how we should feel when in fact THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES works best with its subtle elements . Secondly it suffers from being a bit too long and its storytelling could have done with at least 30 minutes cut out . That said it's still a very good film showing that the scars of war upon the individual and society never ever go away",

The movie may end with a wedding, but does not insult our intelligence by suggesting this guarantees a happy ending. Indeed, as one character suggests, real troubles may be just beginning. But the final mood is one of determined optimism.In a scene that must have stunned audiences then, Homer Parrish, played by true double arm amputee Harold Russell, calmly explains to his girlfriend the way his artificial arms are removed each night. Her response - and his subsequent reaction - are as emotionally rich as anything on film.Wonderful performances all around, direction that manages to be both innovative and restrained, and a moving and tasteful score complete the package.A great, great movie.",

            "content": "William Wyler was inarguably a supreme Hollywood craftsman who thrived under the studio system from the 1930s to the 1950s, an important example for today's filmmakers to discover and follow. His painstaking methods with actors are cruel and insensitive, though there is something to be said when he has directed 31 different Oscar-nominated performances by 31 different actors, 13 of them having won. What is so important about his film-making style is his subtle language that holds complete bearing over the tone of his films, a technique based on long takes and the dramatic possibilities of deep focus shots.This suitably extensive film begins right after WW II, as discharged servicemen played by Dana Andrews, Harold Russell and Frederic March meet while hitching a ride home to a Midwestern city in which they all happen to live. One was a captain and bombardier who still endures from nightmares of combat. Russell had been in the Navy and lost both of his hands with mechanical hook prostheses in their stead. March served as an infantry sergeant fighting in the Pacific.Wyler himself was commissioned a major in the Air Force during World War II and on his return to Hollywood shot The Best Years of Our Lives. Having such fresh and similar experience to his characters, this should have been at least as powerful as The Heiress because of how personally he perceives it, just as he did The Heiress. And while it holds touching passages, this epic hometown drama does not pack the wallop it promises. It is a traditional melodrama about the troubles of servicemen struggling to be relevant to life in postwar America and readjust to the lives to which they return, and as this it is good, not dull or badly made by any means. Despite a flat performance by Russell, one for which you can't blame him, for he never was an actor before but a serviceman himself who trained paratroopers with explosives with an outcome identical to that of his unfortunate character, this film is capably dished up by its especially good performances by Fredric March, Teresa Wright, Virginia Mayo and Hoagy Carmichael, who can act out dialogue while playing the piano, in addition to clever deep-focus setups.",

Fred Derry (Dana Andrews),a decorated young airman, Al Stephenson (Frederic March), an older man serving as a sergeant, and a sailor, Homer Parrish (Harold Russell), who is retuning with the loss of his hands and must use metal hooks. The war has affected each of them in their own way. Al Stephenson, who is coming home to a cushy job at a bank and a very nice family, has a problem with alcohol. Fred Derry comes home suffering from nightmares. He discovers his wife has been cheating on him and is more of a party girl than anything else. Homer has the worst physical transformation of them all. Mentally, he comes home not being able to stand his family feeling sorry for him and then tries to drive his fianc\u00e9 away when she tries to care for him. All and all this is a serious look of what really happens to soldiers when they return home from war. The performances of these men were superb demonstrating openly the mental and physical realities that go along with the horrors of war. Each performance is subtle and genuine. Al's wife, Millie (Myrna Loy) does an excellent job portraying the supportive wife, helping Al assimilate to his old life. Marie Derry (Virginia May) is looking sharp playing the mouthy, cheating wife of Fred Derry. Teresa Wright deserves a nod too; playing Peggy Stephenson, Al's daughter who falls in love with Fred. This film has amazing cinematography. With the use of deep-focus photography, the meaning of each scene reveals itself to the viewer, instead of just being shown close-up after close-up. For example, the wedding scene between Homer and his fianc\u00e9, the director, Wyler, focuses on the entire room, but as Homer and his girl are getting married, we can also see Fred and Al's daughter, Peggy, professing their love to each other. This film runs a little long, approximately three hours, but is certainly a must see. The story is strong and the performances are outstanding. The director, William Wilder, utilizes his years of experience and talent to bring to the screen the most accurate depictions of the combat veterans he came in contact with during his years of service during World War II.",

Andrews has to deal with dissatisfied wife Virginia Mayo; March has to adjust to being back with wife Myrna Loy and their two grown children; Russell has had his hands blown off in war (he was played by non-actor Russell who really had lost his hands in the war).I first saw this back in the 1980s at a revival theatre. I remember being totally bored and fighting to stay awake. I think I was too young to appreciate it. Years later I started watching it casually on TV--and liked it. I was almost never bored and the stories pulled me in. It is exceptionally well directed by William Wyler and virtually the entire cast is flawless. The women in the movie actually give the best performances. Loy, Mayo and Theresa Wright are all just great. Andrews also was very good. March, however, came across as very unsympathetic and Russell was terrible (but he never was an actor).However it's way too long--three hours is a bit much. This movie could easily lose an hour. And this movie was (for its time) relevant and pretty shocking. Today it still is relevant (sadly with the war we have now) but no longer shocking. I found many of the situations contrived and forced and there were some REALLY unbelievable happy endings all around. Still this should be seen for just the acting and directing alone.A good film but no masterpiece. I give it an 8.",

            "content": "What more can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is William Wyler's masterpiece about soldiers returning home from World War II, and their struggles to adjust, along with the struggles of the women they love. Fredric March won the Oscar for his portrayal of Al Stephenson, an upper-middle class banker returning home to his lovely wife (Myrna Loy, who actually gets top billing despite being in a supporting role), good apartment and job, and two lovely children. Although March does a fine job, he's actually not at his best here: although Stephenson has been changed by his war experiences and seeing working-class people, his character's adjustment is fundamentally less difficult than that of Andrews' or Russell's characters. March's Al Stephenson is written as if he's being filmed through a softer lens than the other characters; he doesn't have nearly the sort of conflict and rough edges that March portrayed excellently in a whole range of other movies (eg. \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\", \"A Star is Born\", \"\"Inherit the Wind\", and even a lesser movie like \"The Young Doctors\").The Best Actor Oscar really should have gone to Dana Andrews, who puts in a stunning performance as Fred Derry, a man literally from the wrong side of the tracks, who returns home to find that he lacks the skills to fit into the new world. He got married just before leaving for the war to a woman he doesn't really love (in fact being in love with Wright's character), and can't cope with either this or his inability to get a good job, being forced and humiliated into going back to his old job as a soda jerk.Finally, we come to Harold Russell, who plays Homer Parrish, a navy man who lost both his hands when his ship was bombed by the Japanese. Russell, who had had no previous acting experience, does an outstanding job, portraying both the eternal American spirit of optimism (eg. In his comment about being lucky that he still has his elbows), as well as the conflict of trying to adjust not only to having lost his hands, but to the fact that the people around him treat him differently. Deep down inside, he still loves his girlfriend Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell), but doesn't want to be a burden on her. This conflict creates some of the most heartbreaking scenes in the movie, such as the scene in which Homer's father puts him to bed, and the key sequence in which Homer shows Wilma what she'd really be getting into if she married him.As for the supporting performances, they're all wonderful, too. Myrna Loy hits all the right notes as the wife Al Stephenson comes home to (and the rest of us would like to come home to); Teresa Wright suitably captures all the emotions in her complex relationship with Fred Derry, from sympathy when he's having a nightmare, to the piteous nature of her intention to break up his marriage (\"with an axe\", as her father humorously suggests). Virginia Mayo does well as Derry's wife, the nightclub singer who still wants to live a high life despite having a husband who can't adjust; and Cathy O'Donnell plays off Harold Russell beautifully. Finally, Hoagy Carmichael provides light relief as Butch, the piano-playing bar proprietor uncle of Homer.Gregg Toland handles the cinematography, and once again shows his mastery of deep focus, particularly in one scene where Andrews is breaking off his relationship with Wright via a phone call in a booth way in the background, while Homer, Al, and Butch are at the piano in the foreground; and another scene where Andrews and Wright meet again at a wedding. The only minor quibble I'd have is that sometimes one gets the impression that Toland is doing these scenes just to show off how well he can do deep focus.\"The Best Years of Our Lives\" runs some 170 minutes, but it's one of the very few movies much longer than about two-and-a-half hours that doesn't feel as though it could benefit significantly by having scenes pared down. \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is one of the ten great American movies, and rates a 10 out of 10.",

The second Fred runs into more difficulties. With no skills or experience he is forced to return to his job at a drugstore;to make matters worse his flighty,and shallow wife starts to reveal her true self. Finally, there's Homer a young,good natured sailor who lost both hands in the war. Physically his dilemma seems the worse but in many ways he is better off than Fred. Unlike Fred he receives a steady paycheck from the government and he has strong family support with a girlfriend who actually loves him unlike Fred's wife. Nonetheless, the film isn't about which man has the worst problems but rather how each one deals with his own.William Wyler is no stranger to the struggles of the protagonists as he himself served in the war. Perhaps for this reason he is able to do such a stellar and Oscar winning job.\nDana Andrews,Fredric March,Harold Russell, and Teresa Wright all give incredible performances;Fredic March and Harold Russell each on an Oscar for their performance(more like 2 in Russell's case).\nEqually noteworthy is Robert Sherwood and his top shelf dialogue and Gregg Tolland-the man who brought Welles' imagination to the screen in Citizen Kane.(Tolland isn't the only Kaney with Ray Collins in a brief role)\nHowever,one minor flaw in the film is the dated and melodramatic score which does take some of the drama from some scenes.The Best Years Of Our Lives won 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture, and upon release was the second highest grossing film behind Gone With The Wind. Though the film is a little melodramatic at times it is also moving,entertaining and superb.",

            "content": "As long as there are wars, there will be soldiers coming home from them after long absences. And there will be movies like this one that detail what some of those soldier experience. This movie is one of the first, and one of the best, to tackle this sensitive subject. The movie concentrates on three soldiers coming home to a smallish Midwestern city from WWII and it walks a fine line between being too stark (blind and paralyzed) and being overly sunny (parades and public honors). Care is also taken to represent the three main branches of the military: Al is an infantry Sargent, Homer is a Navy seaman, and Fred is an Army Air Corps Captain (the Air Force was not made an official branch of the U.S. Military until 1947). These three had disparate backgrounds before the war: Al was a banker with a wife and two kids; Fred was a soda jerk, recently married; Homer was a middle class guy living with his parents, having a girlfriend next door. The initial scenes are some of the most moving where we see the excitement the guys have in flying over the city in coming back, only to be followed by witnessing the anxiety over what they will find on the home front.After the initial setup the story follows the three soldiers through their initial reentry into a culture they hardly recognize until they are on a path to integration. It's not a one-way street--families and friends also have their share of anxieties and readjustments. Perhaps Homer has the toughest row to hoe, since he lost both hands during the war. You are forced to see the obstacles Homer faces, both physical and emotional. Homer's situation was brought home to me when he took his prosthetic arms off and laid them to the side and commented that if the door to his bedroom closed, he would be as helpless as a baby when it came to getting out. Homer's situation is presented in detail and with much feeling and it makes you think about the daily ordeals any handicapped person faces. I found the acting uniformly good, even non-actor Harold Russell as Homer. I particularly liked Myrna Loy as Al's wife Milly. The banter between Milly and Al sometimes offered a bit of comic relief--Loy's personality that made her so successful in the Thin Man movies breaks through on occasion. The scene that had Fred pretending to sell Al's daughter perfume was funny and charming. But, befitting the subject matter, there is not a whole lot of humor to be had here.The black and white photography is notable. There are some interesting scenes using mirrors. As with many movies from the 40s and 50s the musical score gets a little out of control at times leaving little doubt as to what emotions you should be having.Of interest is the fact that the movie is a bit of a time capsule. I got a feel for the time period in terms of the dress, the cars, the night life, and so forth. The sex appeal of the women in this film withstands the test of time--indeed, maybe less explicit dress is more enticing. The brief footage in the nightclubs of Gene Krupa in one scene and Tennessee Ernie Ford in another was fun to see. And the scene with Hoagy Carmichael playing the piano while counseling Homer to calm down was a pure delight. I wish there had been more of Carmichael. The scene toward the end showing the graveyard for airplanes was sobering and could be seen as a metaphor for what was happening to the three soldiers--what was recently a vital resource was being processed for salvage. This movie might be a little too polished, but I admire it for its courage in taking on a serious topic so soon after the war, and doing so with honesty and style. The themes touched on are no less relevant now than they were then.",

            "content": "A really interesting and remarkable film, all the more so for being made in almost the immediate aftermath of the Allied victory of the Second World War when you'd expect Hollywood to produce celebratory even triumphal movies. Instead the viewer is presented with the intertwining stories of three battle-scarred veterans, ex-banker Fredric March, who tries to blot out his memories of the war from a bottle, shop assistant Dana Andrews, sufferer from PTSD, who low-status civvy-street return to the same lowly, indeed lower status job doesn't satisfy the ambitions of his floozy wife Virginia Mayo and young Harold Russell, a real-life vet and first time actor whose hands got blown off in a bomb explosion. Complications arise in particular when Andrews reciprocates March's daughter's attraction to him.The film trails its future intentions in its opening scene when Andrews returning pilot is unable to pay the fare of a regular flight back home, his place on the plane taken by the next in line, a rich middle aged businessman who can afford the cost of extra luggage which he gets carried around for him a black attendant. The way that nations treat their returning fighting forces still makes the news today, but back then was seen to be particularly patronising, unsympathetic and miserly. All three men struggle to adjust to everyday life and come up variously against snobbery, condescension and ignorance, but with all of them too, their wartime experiences have scarred them crippling them emotionally and making it hard for them to fit back into society after five years away.For me however, I just could have done without the romance that springs up between Andrews and Wright, which, sensitively written and played as it was, seemed to belong to a different, melodramatic if still modern movie with its outlook on divorce. Similarly, the happy ending that all three men get seemed a little too much to be playing to the gallery, because I'm pretty sure that it wasn't the case for many a returning vet at the time.The acting by all is sensitively and intuitively played, not forgetting the fine work by the women too, Mayo, Wright, Myrna Loy as March's worldly-wise wife and Cathy O'Donnell as Russell's loyal fianc\u00e9e while director Wyler, ably assisted by master cameraman Gregg Toland is a masterclass in understatement. It would have been easy for Wyler to milk certain scenes and lapse into sentimentality but he never does so. A box office smash on release and much garlanded with Oscars, it's an excellent, engrossing and perceptive study of how the war affected the lives of both active participants and their families back home.",

At the time of its release it was a smash hit at the box office while later taking home seven Oscars.The story concerns a trio of WWII veterans returning to their homes in small-town America after the war. Each finds difficultly in picking up where they left off, both in terms of their place in small-town society and their relationships with their loved ones. It is worth noting that the screenplay resulted in one of the film's Oscar wins.The cast is quite good and two of the individuals (Fredric March & Harold Russell) took home Oscars for their performances. Russell's performance is especially noteworthy since he wasn't even a professional actor. In fact, Russell also landed a second, honorary Oscar for 'bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance' in the film. The other male star, Dana Andrews, wasn't recognized with a nomination but I think that he gave a fine performance as well. As for the women (who also weren't recognized with any nominations), Teresa Wright leads the way while Myrna Loy & Virginia Mayo contributed solid performances as well.Wyler's direction is impeccable and deservingly earned him an Oscar. The editing by three-time Oscar winner Daniel Mandell also earned an Oscar while Gregg Toland's cinematography is noted for its use of deep focus. Hugo Friedhofer's Oscar-winning score also deserves mention.It's easy to see that the film is finely crafted but all of this would have been for naught if the story wasn't both authentic and touching. While I'm not exactly a huge fan of this brand of romantic drama I have to admit that the film did not leave me unmoved.

Three servicemen (Oscar winners Fredric March and Harold Russell along with excellent character-actor Dana Andrews) are finally coming back to their small town after the war ends. They have never met before, but share a common bond due to their horrific experiences overseas. March has had a wandering eye while off to war and this creates sparks with wife Myrna Loy. The fact that he has also developed a bad drinking habit only adds to the couple's problems. Andrews has been two-timed by wife Virginia Mayo and he starts to develop feelings for March's daughter (the beautiful Teresa Wright). Russell, a sailor who lost both hands in the war, comes home and has trouble relating to his family and his fiance (Cathy O'Donnell) as he becomes embarrassed by the awkwardness he has with his hooks that act as his new hands. It is also made quite clear that fighting for your country does not necessarily mean a hero's welcome back as job opportunities are few and far between as the national economy adjusts to the fact that the war effort is no more. And of course there are those few in the U.S. who look down upon World War II veterans all together, questioning their motives and deeds. This film, directed by Oscar-winner William Wyler, pulls no punches in telling an important story that many would have stayed away from. Keep in mind this was made in 1946. The war was still very fresh in everyone's mind. March was truly one of the most under-rated actors of any era as he gives his finest performance here. Non-actor Harold Russell, who lost his hands ironically on D-Day (June 6, 1944) while he was back in the states (North Carolina) instructing paratroopers when some TNT went off in his hands, gives one of the most memorable roles ever captured on film. He remains the only actor in history to receive two Oscars for one role (he won a competitive Best Supporting Actor Oscar and an honorary Oscar as well). A moving and highly emotional event. With the exception of \"Citizen Kane\" and \"Casablanca\", arguably the finest film produced during the finest cinematic decade ever. 5 stars out of 5.",

There have been films made on War, some friendly some anti war some were action films some were explosive but i haven't got to see a film on War heroes after they return home. How difficult and somewhat humiliated it could be for War veterans to earn respect and money at the same time after dignified experience in War which is useless in civilian's corporate life. The Best Years Of Our Lives finally breaks the shell of this topic and also creates a warm atmosphere along with heart touching love stories. You know while watching this film i was literally praying that, please God this is going so good please this should end on happy note and guess what it ended so beautifully. Oscar honoured this Classic film but IMDb users should have brought it into Top Rated 250 films, we gotto be ashamed little bit. Well, coming to the film's prospects i don't really see much to be criticized as Acting, Writing, Screenplay, Dialogues, Production and Direction all fields were absolutely fantastic. The film with 170 minutes of runtime won Oscar for Best Editing, do i really need to say more now? William Wyler does marvellous job while crafting this story i mean linking 3 War veterans lifes, troubles and their love Stories is a sign of Intelligent filmmaking. And the way he crafted all the diamonds like Myrna Loy, Fredric March, Dana Andrews, Teresa Wright, Virginia Mayo and surprise package Harold Russell in the film truly made all those shine brightly. Now just one compliant i personally felt there should have been one speech at the climax of all 3 heroes sharing their experience from War and how they gave Best Years of Their Lives for the country. This one scene would have made it a Masterpiece. Well, 7 Oscars for this film against films like 'Brief Encounter' and 'Its Wonderful Life' proves that juries had tough time at 1947 Academy Awards.\nRating- 8/10*",

            "content": "It is no surprise that William Wyler's `The Best Years of Our Lives' earned the Oscar for Best Picture in 1947.  It is a study of what happens to three GIs when they are shipped home after WWII, and how their home lives have both changed and adjusted without them.  In this case, we have a soldier (played by Harold Russell) who lost his hands in the war and now must use hooks. Despite his incredible attitude and the skill with which he uses the hooks, he finds himself the object of pity among his family and some friends, and is uncertain about his longtime sweetheart's level of commitment, now that his handicap will affect them the rest of their lives. There is also a soldier (Dana Andrews) who married his wife 20 days before he shipped off overseas and as a result, never really got to know her or start a life with her, and finds that she has done just fine without him. Finally, there is the middle-aged soldier (Fredric March) who returns to his wife and two children, and back to his life as a bank executive.This was probably a really meaningful and relevant film in 1946, when it was released.  And if you look at it now in that light, then it is more impactful.  It is definitely timeless in that the sense of isolation and detachment could be universal for anyone in any situation.  The film is a little dated in that there are stereotypes (the floozy-esque and shrewish wife Andrews, who then transfers his love to a pure and kind younger girl), and also some plot pints that are given to us in glaring form, yet they went nowhere (most noticeably, the whole issue with March's drinking problem, which somehow miraculously heals itself \u0096 unless I missed something).While The Best Years of Our Lives is certainly an excellent film as a whole, probably the most amazing element is Harold Russell, the real-life ex-GI who really did lose his hands and therefore really does utilize hooks in order to function.  He went on to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for this film, which was probably based on political and social reasons as it was merit, but his performance really was inspirational and heart-felt and effective sixty years later.  The next time you are in the mood for a three hour melodrama, this is a great choice.  I had wanted to see this film for over a decade and when I finally watched it, I was not disappointed. \n--Shelly",

The acting is fantastic in this movie, and it's also very significant in the fact that it is the very first film to ever use a disabled actor in a leading role, that actor being Harold Russell.Originally I thought Russell's performance was perfect except for the fact that he seemed very disconnected to the girl he came back to, and what I mean by this is, it didn't seem as though Russell was connecting the emotion to the scene with her but then I realized that his disconnection was perfect in the scenes with the girl he came back to(played by Cathy O'Donnell). The confusion of what he's feeling is the true genius of his acting with O'Donnell in those scenes, whether he meant to or not, it was great acting and Russell won the academy award that year for best supporting actor.This is a movie that makes you think and that will effect you more(that you will probably realize you like more) as it digests more in your system over a few days or a few months or even a few years. Every one of us can relate in some way to the 3 main characters in The Best Years of Our Lives and I, myself personally, have had a girlfriend just like Dana Andrew's character had in the movie, I mean delineated to the core, so I felt his pain in a lot of ways.Also, I really enjoy the real world feeling this movie generates. It's a real solid script as There are no Clich\u00e9 speeches given here. Things are dealt with in a real manner, a true to life manner and I respect that about this film.The Best Years of Our Lives is a very significant movie, and should be seen, at least once, by anyone who considers themselves to be a film buff or film historian so that they can truly appreciate the pioneer movie of this kind of material.",

Many movies and popular treatments of the immediate post-war period overlook the tremendous uncertainty that faced returning servicemen and their families. It was believed by many that a recession or depression would follow the war, leaving veterans with no jobs, and divorce rates went way up as wartime couples (much like in this movie) found the going tough during peacetime. Not until after this movie was made did it become clear that the economy would do well and that the GIs, supported in large part by the GI Bill, would come to prosper and spark the remarkable postwar expansion of the economy.

            "content": "So many great talents were utilized in \"The Best Years of Out Lives\", the result has to be somewhat miraculous. Think of what its director, William Wyler, faced; in the aftermath of a military victory over statist powers who had committed abominable crimes and engulfed the world if battles, he was making a film that argued that the US's leaders were themselves profoundly anti-individual--that they had \"wasted the best years of the lives of those drafted or misled into fighting the war--which since it ignored the rights of individuals had been for nothing except argument over the degree of slavery men were to exist under.\" There are beautiful sets by Julia Heron, Gregg Toland's cinematography and a script by Robert E. Sherwood, author of \"The Road to Rome\" and other defenses of individuals against tyrannical ideas. The ironic title was used to draw the talents of actors such as Frederic March, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, Dana Andrews, Virginia Mayo, Cathy O'Donnell and Hoagy Carmichael into a large-scale but thematic drama. The clever plot line was the experiences of thee \"couples\" after the soldiers (three being spotlighted) tried to return home to a 'victory culture\". Their bitter experiences and their realization of their own need to fight again against what was happening on the homefront poses a strong and sobering counterpoint to the conventional notion being sold that \"all was well with \"America\"\". March and his wife have a terrible time adjusting, and he is drinking; O'Donnell's young man, Harold Russell,, has hooks instead of hands and wonders if life can even be worth living; and worst of all Andrews' wife throws him over for a guy with dough and he has lost years, causing employers to ignore or deny his rights to a job, to consideration on his individual merits, to have even what he had before he had been ripped from his life and thrust into the arena of risk--for nothing, and loss of everything he had ever had. The shattering climax of the film comes when each of the three has to confront the need to do battle again,each for his own happiness; and all three succeed in finding the courage to go on fighting--each for his own happiness, which is now being threatened by a curiously anti-self, anti-reality indifferent an un-American United States. Wyler's direction, especially of the scene where Andrews sits in the cockpit of a mothballed B-17, alone and the scene of Russell's wedding is wonderful indeed. This is a most powerful film and a great one on its own terms, one women and men can agree on for once. Music by Hugo Friedhofer and costumes by Irene Sharaff add to its luster. One of the best and most unexpected films of all time, in stunning B/W.",

It's not just the realistic portrayal of life for returning WWII veterans that make this film the incredible experience that it is, but also its depiction of love, family life, heartache, altruism, and human decency.  All of the actors, even the big stars, were extremely adept at portraying ordinary people dealing with extraordinary circumstances.The scene where Myrna Loy's character explains, in front of her husband, the realities of marriage to her daughter is truly inspired and provides such powerful insight into these characters as individuals and as a family.  I've yet to see another film from that time period that dares to cover that territory in such a realistic manner.Other favorite scenes: when Homer first returns home and his family and his girl are so overjoyed to see him that they don't even notice his missing hands, and then his mother speaks for all of them with her stifled sob once they finally notice.  The scene where Fred, embittered by his job situation and his failed marriage, urges Homer to rush home and propose to Wilma immediately.  He is able to unselfishly encourage Homer to see the good in his life while his own is in shambles.  There are many other amazingly touching scenes--these are just a few.If you haven't seen this film, I urge you to do so.

            "content": "Being \"moved\" is one thing. Crying might be another. Happiness, et cetera. But I am convinced that there is a particular physical reaction that can only be provoked by our best friend and our greatest fear -- the movies. It is that little wobbly apparatus that lays dormant in your throat until something so pretty, so perfect, and so manufactured flashes in front of you. I rarely feel it. Rarer still is a tear. Though there were no waterworks, I got the Wobble twice in my first viewing of The Best Years of Our Lives, a 1946 film directed by William Wyler that addresses civilian readjustment for three soldiers after World War II.Because the Wobble is so elusive, I am always forced to reconcile it. Impossible is locating a Wobble worthy moment that was not processed, packaged, and delivered precisely for that purpose. Here, there are three noteworthy contributors to the immortality of this film and its undeniable place in any Pantheon. They are Gregg Toland, Hugo Friedhofer, and the performing ensemble.Toland has been lauded as history's cinematographer par excellence. His contribution to The Grapes of Wrath, Wuthering Heights, and Citizen Kane is marked legendary and when Orson Welles decided to share his credit card with Toland, it cemented his status forever. People still talk about how he practically invented the deep-focus lens and pioneered many lighting techniques that would one day congeal into something called \"film noir.\" I would never doubt the second and I don't know enough about lens history to argue with the first, but one thing is absolute -- he adapted better than anybody else. His career is littered with plenty duds next to a couple spikes of unreachable perfection. Though, even on marginal pictures like Come and Get It, his photography is unmistakable - not for deep focus - but for the bold contrasts, the intelligent integration of cinematic and emotional mood, and the marvelous employment of natural light whenever possible.By the time The Best Years of Our Lives rolled around, Toland was secure in his technique and did little to challenge the picture. However, his impeccable style and clarity only required slight adjustment to combine brilliantly with William Wyler's organizational fixation. When Al returns home and so timidly walks into his own home (after ringing the doorbell, no less), he embraces his wife about 20 feet away from the camera, down a long hallway. They are nicely in focus. So are their children standing 5 feet away from the camera. This is to be expected of Toland, but what wasn't expected was the Wobble. By comparing Toland's use of deep focus in this film with something like Kane, we begin to notice how his gift wasn't all in this lens crap, it was in his wisdom of when and how to use it. With Wyler, Toland used the device to synchronize with his organizational instinct and his obsession with neatness. Welles, on the other hand, encouraged deep focus to occupy a component of Kane's megalomania, to follow him down the barrel of the gun. Same method. Two wildly different results.Friedhofer's score epitomizes Hollywood music at the peak of its restrained decadence. So many refer to this idealized style as \"invisible\" or \"mood music,\" whatever that means. The truth is, audiences have visceral responses to good musicianship no matter where they hear it. Here, Friedhofer exploits the broad, emotional material by basing most thematic material around a simple, proto-Bernsteinian motive of three notes. We attach ourselves to those three notes and with ample suspension and tension being released at important moments... Wobble. It's a wonderful piece of music that isn't invisible, but a prime component to the visual context.I forgot to look at who casted this film. In all likelihood it was the studio. Whoever was responsible deserves a pat on the back. So many actors and actresses underacting and underactressing in one place is a beautiful sight to behold. Understatement and repression is baseline and their faces can traverse miles of thought in meditation. The performances control the (ec)static nature of the film, the collaboration is so propulsive. They all contribute to The New Wyler Order and tidy up the scenes with restraint. If you don't pay enough attention, they might fool you into seeing the shadow of Realism, the greatest danger at the Movies. Of course, Wyler needed his Order, his technical and moral exactitude. How else would anything that even tried to question American values sneak past Goldwyn?92.4",

            "content": "The Best Years Of Our Lives is a remarkable achievement. It came out when the harsh realities of PTSD-like symptoms and the general realities of war were rarely taken so seriously in society. The film was bold enough to even go a step further and show how societal expectations of them are at odds with what they need. Time and time again in the first half of the film, we see characters happy to see the veterans return and explicitly expect them to put the war behind them and move on, while clearly it was both a formative experience which is emotionally important to the men as well as being traumatic and something they can't get out of their heads as much as they try. While the three main characters all deal with this general challenge, their specifics are each quite distinct which allows us to understand the facets of integration challenges. For Homer, the challenge is simple but the most difficult to ignore: his handicap. This is one of the major ways the film was bold - even now, physical handicaps are something of an uncomfortable subject rarely touched in art, and that was only that much more true 74 years ago. For Al, it's feeling out of touch with his family. For Fred, who for my money is the central protagonist of the story, it's a more complex combination of trauma, a strained relationship with his wife, and a feeling of occupational inadequacy, all of which feed into each other. One of the ways the film surprised me was in the gradual transition to the psychological character drama of the first half into the more romance-heavy plot of the second half. After letting the film sit for a bit, it makes more sense to me, as I interpret the romance as the way Fred and Homer end up successfully reintegrating. Homer was frustrated with his own inability to do all he used to be able to do, and his self-doubt made him believe Wilma wouldn't truly love him, but pity him. Fred realized that money was how his wife judged his worth, and that she expected him to put the war behind him. On the other hand, Peggy cared for him as a person, and he felt more self-assured the more he accepted his love for Peggy. Al doesn't have as clear a reintegration arc as the other two - he seems to be more easily able to return to how his life was, albeit with an appreciation for the character of people rather than just their collateral.\nI love the scene where Fred is going through the old planes and goes in one just to remember what it was like. He was highly successful and was deeply invested in his job as a bomber, and seeing him instinctively drawn back to them was wonderful, followed by him finding himself a job out of thin air. I also love the repeated focus on the ribbons, as a symbol for how people saw the war as an interesting thing that happened but something they completely detach from the sacrifices and human side of the war that those ribbons represent. This is exemplified when Fred's wife insists he wear the uniform, just for the cool factor of the appearance. The cinematography is very layered throughout, as we frequently see background character reactions to the main characters. The wedding scene is an easy example of this, as we see the joy surrounding Wilma and Homer while Fred and Peggy eye each other and get increasingly emotional as they hear the wedding vows. It's very impressive for such a long movie to have no drag but to be engaging and evolving throughout, and I expected it even less from a 1946 character drama/romance. I was thrown off by the seeming transition away from the effects of war and PTSD in the second half, but I now think we do see the gradual integration in the second half as a resolution to this struggle. Great movie that has flawed characters we can root for and thoughtful, honest consideration of postwar society.",

This film is about the lives of servicemen upon their return home after the war. For them, surviving the war was just the start. Now they had to survive reintegrating back into society, their family, their jobs (if they still had one).I think this film brings up so many important issues these men and their families faced. WWII took place before I was born, so I do't have any personal reference on which to draw. So it is eye-opening for me to be able to get the personal perspective of what these brave men and women faced. Granted, the movies aren't exactly telling the whole truth, but it is informative nonetheless. It gives us a snapshot of that time and generation.The cast couldn't have been better in their roles. I was drawn into all their stories, not just by their good acting but the superb script writing as well. Dana Andrews' performance stood out most to me - he was so likable and then you hate the fact that he has such a cold, heartless wife. I'm sure this created a lot of conflict in the typical 40's viewer, as it has you rooting for a divorce so that it clears the way for sweet Teresa Wright's character.I am so grateful for the sacrifices made by the servicemen and women in our country.

            "content": "Regarded by William Wyler fans as one of the director's best films, \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is a fine but somewhat over-long melodrama which charters the lives of three American military servicemen who struggle with post-war civilian readjustment. The film pre-dates \"The Men\", a similar film by Fred Zinnemann and starring Marlon Brando, by almost four years. Our trio of veterans are Fred Derry, Homer Parrish and Al Stephenson, all of whom return from WW2 to their homes in Boone City, Ohio. The men belong to different military branches (Airforce, Army, Navy) and different social strata. Their early scenes are powerful. Wyler watches as the trio, who've never met one another before, share a military transport plane back home. Their journey takes them over an airfield packed with hundreds of disused aircraft, the machines discarded and dilapidated, echoing their own bodies. Later they fly over cities, towns and the American corn-belt; normalcy looks so far away from up here. The trio struggle to readjust to civilian life. Derry's wife no longer loves him and he resents his new job. Homer has it even worse. He's lost both hands in the war and now uses a pair of augmented hooks. Ashamed of these hooks, much of the film watches as Homer's family and sweetheart struggle to accept his disfigurement. Interestingly, Homer's played by Harold Russell, a real life veteran who really did lose his hands in the war. The film somewhat exploits him, too proud of Harold's hooks, his mutilated body, even as Wyler warmly bring us close to the kid. But a little goes a long way. While early scenes with Homer are powerful, by the 90 minute mark Wyler has lingered salaciously on these hooks far too long, treating them more as a special effect, novelty icon or freak show attraction. The film's last subplot involves Al Stephenson. He's given a job at a bank but is reprimanded because of his over eagerness to grant loans to retuning soldiers. But rather than fire him, Stephenson's boss compassionately schools the veteran; he teaches Stephenson how to properly function in the workplace.All three veterans are thus presented as outsiders (early shots show them sitting in B-17 observation bubbles, taxi cabs or dark corners, always cut off from others) who eventually learn that others are willing to accept them. The trio's perception that they are \"no good\" (Derry), that their masculinity has been shattered (Homer), that they are too old or out of touch (Stephenson), is thus shown to be \"all in their head\". Veterans, in other words, are accepted by all, it's up to them to accept themselves. The film was praised in the 40s and later by a whole new generation of critics in the 60s and 70s, for \"deglamourising war\" and pointing out how servicemen are effectively \"used, mauled and discarded by the state.\" Overall, however, it's a very comforting film. Wyler's tone is one of piety, state, military and family units are all shown to be reassuring and willing to lend helping hands, America combs over its scars and moves on, family and work life go on uninterrupted and all problems are solved with relative ease. Wyler goes into some dark terrain \u2013 he came back from the war a wounded man and was determined to get this film right \u2013 but mostly reassures; roll up your sleeves and get back to business.The film sports some superb black-and-white cinematography by Gregg Toland. Its structure is also interesting \u2013 first act: men as outsiders observing the inside, second act: women as outsiders shut off from and watching men, third act: men and woman sharing the same conciliatory space \u2013 and works well whenever Wyler's not laying on thick domestic melodrama. The film ends powerfully at an aircraft scrapyard.8/10 \u2013 Worth one viewing. See the similarly ironically titled \"The Lucky Ones\" and \"Paths of Glory\".",

            "review_title": "The Battle After",
            "content": "This film, expertly and passionately directed by William Wyler, is a captivating glimpse of America immediately following World War II when scores of veterans returned home from dangerous and distant battles overseas. The story is centered on three servicemen who had each endured combat, respectively on land, at sea, and in the air, and who find themselves back in their fictitious home town of Boone City, which is patterned after Cincinnati. Having dreamed on the battlefront of reuniting with those they love in the familiar, peaceful environment of civilian life, are they adequately prepared for the transition from one world to another? Each of the men carry their battle scars, both physically and mentally, from the war to the \"peaceful\" existence of Boone City. As the superbly directed, explosive drugstore scene indicates, the sad reality is that post-war Boone City, as a microcosm of America itself, is anything but peaceful.Aside from Wyler's outstanding direction, the screenplay by Robert E. Sherwood is very perceptive and often very touching. As moved as I am by the exchanges between Homer and Wilma during the film, I didn't realize just how powerful their dialogue is until I re-read the words in the \"quotes\" section on this website. I'm not ashamed to say that I bawled like a baby when I read at least some of these genuinely heart-rending words, and that is not a frequent occurrence for me.I can't praise the cast enough, both the leads and the support, especially the three men who play the vets, Fredric March, Dana Andrews, and, last but never least, Harold Russell, a non-professional actor who managed to nail two different Oscars for his very credible portrayal of disabled Homer Parish. I also agree with the one reviewer who states that of the three leading men, the best performance comes from the guy who didn't win an Oscar at all, Dana Andrews, in what may be the best role of his lifetime. That having been said, March's drunken speech before the bank bosses at the Cornbelt Loan and Trust is one of the movie's several \"high\" moments, and initially made me as anxious as his wife, played by Myrna Loy, but all's well that ends well.The three leading women, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, and Cathy O'Donnell are excellent as well. While this very important role launched O'Donnell's all too brief career (\"They Live By Night\", \"Ben-Hur\"), it was eventually stifled by producer Samuel Goldwyn only because she married the older brother of director Wyler, with whom Goldwyn was feuding, before she tragically succumbed to cancer at the young age of forty six.Virginia Mayo fought for the role of Marie Derry, the selfish, unlikeable wife of Fred (Andrews), who had not fallen in love with Fred as much as the uniform that he wore. I'm glad that Mayo landed the part because no one could deliver Marie's nasty, sneering lines as well. \"There are drugstores everywhere!\" Ouch! You sure know how to hurt a guy, Marie, especially one who sacrificed so much for your freedom, and you sure love your freedom, sweetheart.",

But in combo of Bicycle Thieves, this movie tells the complete story from both sides of the war victors and losers; none get the happy live. War torn everything, even the lives of the victors. We see it first hand as how Homer struggles to regain himself after losing his hands. Fred also struggles as he has everything a decent man dreams of, but lacks any other skill that he has to bow himself down to the harsh reality of the available work. AL also struggles morally as he chooses to do the right thing. And as we see only Homer's and Frede's story closes out well, as Al's didn't really get a justified ending to his ordeal. The actors did a great job in bringing live to the scenes.",

It is always a moving experience to view this classic and it is unimpeachable evidence of producer Samuel Goldwyn's amazing good fortune (and good taste) in bringing together such an array of wonderful talent to tell a story that must have been an overwhelmingly emotional moviegoing event for the audiences who had, in some way, been touched by WWII's terrible sacrifices.Some years ago, in the course of my employment, I met this film's Oscar-awarded composer, Hugo Friedhofer, whose self-deprecating and drily funny modesty was, somehow, not a surprise.  He was extremely gracious to me and, a few weeks later at Christmastime, presented me with an autographed copy of a \"Composer Authorized Recording\" of his original score, with Frank Collura conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra, a long-playing disc that is accompanied by an eight-page booklet densely printed with notes on the score, its new recording, the principals involved in that enterprise, tributes from some of Mr. Friedhofer's musical peers and, of course, some extremely interesting paragraphs, culled from interviews and other sources, by one Page Cook.  It is a treasured possession, you may be sure, and putting it on the turntable for another listen is a moving reminder of a brief friendship with one of Hollywood's most prolific and talented professionals.",

            "content": "At the beginning of this movie it seems like it is just going to be another World War II movie, but it is not. There are no battle scenes; there are only stories of the events from overseas. Not many movies show the after effects of war. Many will just show a lot of violence to try to do better in the box office. This movie focuses more on a touching story. Also, for this movie to be released at the same time as many soldiers were coming home, it was not only a timely movie, but it must have been important to the soldiers for it to be accurate.When we are shown Fred trying to catch a flight home in the opening sequence, he is not exactly welcomed with open arms. I can only imagine what that must have felt like to a returning veteran. Not only that, but also to come home and struggle to find a decent job and having no other choice but to return to work as a soda jerker would be a such a shame. That was hard enough for Fred, but Homer probably had it the worst. He came home with no arms and found his life was turned completely upside down because of it. I liked that in the end though things worked out for him. As for Al, he came home and had a pleasant family and his old job waiting for him. All three of them had different ranks from different branches of the military, but when they returned home they were just like everybody else trying to survive in the rat race, rather than the fox hole.Even though it is definitely obvious that their paths will cross again early in the movie, I liked how the three stories intertwined. The film also builds suspense subtly, possibly without the average viewer even realizing it; like how we never see Homer's hooks uncovered until near the end of the film. Naturally, Greg Tolland does a great job in the cinema photography department. Deep focus is put to good use; they did not use it just because they could. The scene where Homer is playing the piano and Fred is in the phone booth in the background is a prime example. I also noticed a lot of creative shots done with mirrors throughout the movie.I found this movie to be quite good overall. I usually do not like long movies like this unless there is something special or unique about it. What I liked most about this movie was good storytelling. That is what I always look for the most in a film and this one has it. I think the movie is deserving of the numerous awards it received.",

            "content": "In the Netflix series \"Five Came Back,\" top Hollywood directors examine the effects World War II had five of the top directors of the time. William Wyler, who directed this film, is one of them.No less an iconic director than Stephen Spielberg analyzes Wyler's career, his work during WWII, and this film in particular, which snagged seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and Best Supporting Actor for Harold Russell, who lost both hands in a training accident during the war.The plot, which covers three servicemen returning home to their lives and families, is a familiar one, but Wyler insists on showing the American public that not every returning veteran slides right back into peacetime civilian life. The children have grown up, the wife isn't interested in her husband unless he's the romantic Flyboy, and the sailor without hands ponders on whether his girl will still love him and want to be with him in his changed condition.Spielberg said he watches this movie at least once a year, and always tries to see it with someone who hasn't seen it before, because it has such an impact on newbies. He particularly likes (and I agree with him) the scene where former bombardier Dana Andrews is in the field with the junked airplanes and comes up on a B-17, which is the plane he served on. The cinematography is beyond fantastic, and the score meets the challenge with equal effectiveness.Every performance is spot-on, and the screenplay is tight and effective.I mean, if Spielberg considers this one of the finest American movies ever made, how can you argue? It's as compelling and effective now as it was in 1946. If you get the opportunity, see this film. It's worth your time.",

            "content": "When Robert Osborne introduced \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" on TCM years ago, he started it off by saying that some consider this to be one of the greatest films ever made. I was suspicious, as I had seen the film years earlier and thought it to be a good, not great film, but after that viewing, I now consider it to be a truly great film.The film tells the story of four soldiers who return home to Boone City after the end of WWII. Al Stephenson (Fredric March) returns home to his wife (Myrna Loy) and daughter, Peggy (Teresa Wright). Al also has a son, but he disappears almost entirely by the middle of the film. Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) returns home to a wife (Virginia Mayo) who doesn't seem much like the woman he thought he married and alternatively he is drawn romantically to Peggy. Finally there is Homer (Harold Russell) who returns home to his family and girlfriend with the news that due to war injuries he no longer has his hands; instead two hooks are in their place. The story follows these three men as they attempt to navigate the, not always smooth, transition from wartime to peacetime life as civilians. As evidenced by this film, not every problem was solved by the GI Bill. Memories (and wounds) of the war still linger. The film is not only a fascinating character study of soldiers but also of their loved ones as well. The way the film weaves the stories of these three distinct men together is a storytelling masterstroke. All of their stories fit together, yet are different (they come from different economic backgrounds, for example) and nothing seems forced. Every member of the cast does a wonderful job from the leads to the actors in smaller roles like Virginia Mayo and Gladys George. March's performance is exquisite as he struggles to return to normalcy, especially at his job. Myrna Loy (has there ever been a classier actress?) is great as March's wife. Loy gives a restrained performance but one that radiates beautifully throughout the entire film. Harold Russell won two Oscars for his work here, one was honorary. Is it a great performance? No. But it sure is moving. The producer Sam Goldwyn and director William Wyler deserve credit for casting an actual amputee in the role. This is especially noteworthy when considering how frequently white actors played Asians and Native Americans in those days. When Goldwyn and Wyler could've cast anyone, they instead turned to Russell and the film is much better and more authentic because of that choice. Dana Andrews just might have given the best performance in the entire film. His part is probably the film's most complicated one. His character struggles perhaps the most both in terms of his personal life and in his job. Andrews successfully navigates this course so brilliantly; an honest, subtle, and charming performance.Overall, this film is nearly perfect with the exception of the overreaching score. In my estimation, it is Wyler's best film as well as the best movie about soldiers returning home, and yes maybe one of the greatest American films of all time.",

The transition to civilian life is not easy, although it was much easier then than now.The current variety of wars are, to say the least, not too popular and the public sometimes has the tendency to take their frustrations out on the servicemen.In those days, there was more embrace.The movie's cast is top notch - March, Russell, and Andrews who, in those years, seemed to have been in every third 20th Century Fox movie. He was a workhorse who played a variety of roles and played all of them convincingly.Hoagy Carmichael, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, and cute Cathy O'Donnell were all perfect for their roles.

            "content": "When I think of World War II, my mental image is of veterans coming home with post-traumatic stress, with a bad case of the drinks, and with no hands. It's not about glory or feeling good about a hard-fought job well done. Winning the most-important military conflict of the 20th Century be damned. Now we had to deal with the, ugh, return of guys who fought for a just cause. Didn't they know they're supposed to go into some kind of isolation tank until we need them to fight again?Okay, that was a series of cheap-shots and I dropped all those bombs for a reason. We don't want to deal with the hassle of doing right by the people who've shed blood and brain cells to keep us all safe from tyranny. Many movies have dealt with this topic, although not many of them have done it as well as The Best Years Of Our Lives. The 37th movie on both the 1998 and 2007 Top 100 lists released by the American Film Institute hits hard, but doesn't hit you with a sledgehammer.That's thanks to director William Wyler and writer Robert Sherwood (who was once a film critic). They make it clear that Fredric March (the drunk), Dana Andrews (the PTSD guy who has no place back home), and Harold Russell (the guy who actually lost his hands for real) are not necessarily better off back home in the American Midwest than they were during WWII. Teresa Wright and Myrna Loy play March's patient daughter and wife, respectively, who (unfortunately) are more saintly archetypes than they are real characters.Who's to judge someone for struggling to accept their post-war life on its lousy terms or for turning to the bottle to cope? There aren't easy solutions and The Best Years Of Our Lives (classic Hollywood product that it is) doesn't revel in their pain or just gloss things up for the camera. It suffers from over-length---although the first 30 minutes is positively brilliant---and the women have no depth at all, but the men are handled sensitively and with a keen eye. This is absolutely a fine film, quiet and true.If you liked this snapshot review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the \"Podcasts\" section for our 40-minute Best Years Of Our Lives 'cast...and many others.

Dana Andrews was 38 during the filming of this movie. His character according to the screenplay was in his mid 20s. Andrews, a highly underrated actor, did brilliantly play a character who was supposed to be much younger. 2. Fredric March like all GREAT actors needs at times to be restrained by the director to avoid over-the-top acting. He was mugging for the cameras when he was drunk on the night after his arrival and also the next morning when he was checking out his hang over in his mirror. 3. Dana Andrews was superb as he was in \"Laura,\" \"The Ox-Bowl Incident,\" \"A Walk in the Sun,\" \"The Purple Heart\" and many other films. Why did Fredric March win the Academy Award and why was Dana Andrews not even nominated for his outstanding performance? 4. Harold Russell gave the best performance I have ever seen by a non actor. 5. I realize this was the 1940s but Dana Andrews seemed to have no romantic interest in his exceptionally attractive wife (Virginia Mayo).6. Ray Teal, who played the right wing bigot, years later became famous for portraying the sheriff on \"Bonanza.\"7. The professor from the south wrote that the film was slow moving, boring and poorly acted. The professor more than likely is uninformed about classic films. The beauty and significance of these ageless classics is that they are slow moving character studies that avoid profanity, excessive violence and gratuitous sex.***I was surprised that zero out of 3 people found my review useful.",

Seems like when I mention this film to friends as my #1 favorite, hardly anyone has heard of it; perhaps because it's from 1946. I'm sure I've seen it 10 times. It seems to be in the top 100 of most lists I see. There's still such an attraction of seeing how returning veterans can get back to their normal lives, if possible. Other movies have tried, but none succeed like this one. The 2 hrs and 50 min really give them the chance to develop the characters. I probably found Fredric March's acting to be the most realistic, but that could be spread around especially since Homer wasn't a real actor. You had to feel for Dana Andrews who wanted something better out of life than his old job and just couldn't get it, while being berated by his wife as a loser.",

            "content": "\"The Best Years of Our Lives\" was relevant to the end of WWII (1945). It pertained to returning veterans who had given all to fight for their country. Many gave their lives (for which we are grateful). For even more their place in our society, jobs and family. For them there appeared to be nowhere to go. Upon their return everything had changed.Homer had lost his arms and couldn't believe that his girl, Wilma, could adjust to that and continue to love him. She was going to have to prove him wrong. (As we know, actor Harold Russell had lost both arms to a TNT accident while serving in the Army. The accident happened in 1944.)Fred's wife, Marie, had lived an illicit party life on his military pay. She wanted nothing more to do with him because the money tree had ran out. And the captain's uniform was no longer there for 'eye candy'. They were going to have to work and rebuild their lives. But she had, already, given Fred 'the best years' of her life while he was gone. He had been overseas in London and Paris having 'fun' piloting bombers, probably, over Germany. Al's family were extremely happy to see him. But they had grown-up. Milly had cared for Peggy and Rob, while learning independence. She had worked and kept the family together. Peggy was no longer Daddy's little girl. She was a young woman. And Rob...well Rob was a teenager...enough said. Then there's Al's job at the bank. It was a whole lot different than fighting a war. (I could have stood a stiff drink after a day there and I'm a teetotaler!)Homer, Fred and Al didn't feel they fit in anywhere. What's next for these three heroes? How will their situations be rectified. Get it, watch it and see the outcome!Since we are again at war it would be great if this movie could be pulled out of mothballs, as is, and be reintroduced to the military and civilians of today.",

We have the Airforce bomber Fred Derry,infantryman Sergeant Al Stephenson and sailor Homer Parrish returning home to Boon Town.They fly home on a stopping flight into peace time.They bond and in the cab ride home they all talk about meeting at Butch's at sometime.Homer has lost his hands in naval service and is naturally anxious about how his family and especially his child sweetheart will react-Homer meets his family and Velma his girlfriend rushes to him with a look of love and feeling that is difficult to describe -he in return cannot hug her.Fred returns To his parents to see where his new barely known bride is (married quickly before the start of the war)He senses that something is not right when they tell him she moved out.Al returns to his wife and family where he initially meets his son and daughter and then his wife -- there reunion as they see each other is a time stop moment.William Wyler is a genius filmmaker and this film is probably his best.There are scenes that you look forward to seeing again and again.Fred telling his wife all the money has been spent and that will stay in, the reunion with Al Homer and Fred at Butches.Peggy putting Fred to bed , making him breakfast and dropping him back home in the morning ( Agaain a moment of tension as he cannot get into his apartment a second time and turns back towards Peggy as if a romance will start between them and the door is opened and he is all of a sudden let in )These incredibly strong moments happen again and again through this film.It is so difficult to single out the actors individually but one can try. Frederic March is subtle /large and you believe he was in the infantry and had learnt a few dirty tricks, Talk about a fully rounded portrayal! For me he has great moments throughout this film his firmly telling his daughter Peggy off when she says she has fallen in love - his drunk and hungover scenes which are subtle and beautifully graded , of course his speech at works dinner where his integrity and strength are on show , his threat to Fred and for me just one little moment where he opens his eyes to Fred just as the taxicab drives off! Wow.Dana Andrews gives a career best performance -- He has pride and will not take his soda jerk job and then has to.He has a nobility and you seem him start to fall in genuine love -- at one point Al knocks him out of his reverie and Dana Andrews makes you see this -- it is so real.Harold Russell as Homer Parrish is natural and restrained , the love around him is tangible and when he finally lets Velma 'in' the tears well up in the viewer --this might sound schmaltzy but it isn't at any moment.Teresa Wright as Peggy is strong,sensitive and discreet and you could see why she would attract Fred's attention and Cathy O'Donnell's Velma doesn't seem to be acting at all -- her love for Homer is beautiful to behold! William Wyler's direction is faultless and how he draws out the truth from these actors is a near miracle-Gregg Tollands photography has unforgettable effects in the story telling -- for example --Homer and Al are talking and Fred makes a very important phone call -- even though Al and Homer are central -- you cannot take your eyes off Fred making that call and leaving-- GENIUS",

            "content": "A masterpiece, one of the finest films ever made.Not mentioned much in other reviews are three bedroom scenes, each involving a pair of the main characters. And each with a moment that reveals the genius of the direction and actors.First, the day after returning home, and amid a slapstick scene involving Al taking a shower in his pajamas, Al and Milly are alone for the first time in four years. The sexual tension is palpable as they natter on as if strangers, talking about how the kids have grown and all the housecleaning Milly has to do. Milly gathers up the breakfast tray, turns to leave, and says something like \"well I better get these cleaned up\". At that moment Al grabs her wrist, and they lock eyes, the pent-up emotion of four years apart pouring out. They are still husband and wife. The camera doesn't need to show what happens next.Second, Fred is sleeping it off as a guest in Peggy's bedroom, suffering PTSD nightmares. When she comes in to check on him, he is disoriented. She says she is Peggy as she reaches over for his blanket, and he tries to grope her. \"Not THAT Peggy\" she says as she slaps his hand away. He checks his hip pocket for his wallet to make sure she hasn't robbed him. Only over breakfast a while later does Fred recall how he got there.Finally, in perhaps the most intimate bedroom scene ever put on screen, Homer invites Wilma to his bedroom to show her what a life with him would be like, given his disabilities. Homer's father sees them going up the stairs; ordinarily, a young woman going to her boyfriend's bedroom would be strictly forbidden, but the father understands that this must be done, and turns away. Then, after witnessing Homer's dependence on others for everyday tasks, Wilma assures him that she still loves him and leaves, closing the bedroom door behind her. In a brilliant but subtle moment of film-making, we see her return a few seconds later to open the door and leave it ajar (Homer told her that without his prostheses, he couldn't turn the doorknob).",

My father felt guilt for being kept from the service due to his astigmatism (which he never spoke of until his later years.) Never mind that he was a medical student and physician who never used those statuses as a reason out.\nIt is moronic to try to block war experiences from our lives, as did the villanous characters in this film, or like this country's shocking disregard for those returning from Vietnam (\"you bums - you didn't win!\")War is a chronic disease that has infected humankind since Cain slew Abel. It is a condition that must be adjusted to, whether wars are big or small (and they go on all of the time, out of the headlines mostly, currently very much in our faces.)This film is a snapshot in time, powerful but not preachy, showing the viewer that war, in whatever form and during whichever era, is always with us.",

            "content": "World War 2 was a conflict that tested the resolved of the American nation, and it's spirit. The film changed the country permanently, in many ways, the world was a different place. So few films captured how the world was changing, as did this film. Frederick March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell play veterans on their way back to their hometown. They strike up a friendship on the way home and as they have to deal with the various aspects of their homecoming they talk and comfort each other, and try to help each other to adjust to going back home. Myrna Loy plays the love interest to Frederick March, a very nice woman who appreciates all that Frederick March is going through, but he is married to another woman that does not, and is more concerned about appearances than she is of the welfare of her husband.Even though movies were not allowed to delve into the issues that movies can today this movie talked about so many things that even movies today won't even touch, like the horrible state of job availability, how sometimes veterans are not appreciated for all that they do, even when they are physically altered as a result, and how they are set aside and hurt by American business who sometimes don't appreciate anything they do. This movie made quite a statement for the day, and I haven't seen too many movies do it since. This is a movie that more than other movies talks about a specific time, talks about certain standards and thoughts of the time. Much of the America talked about at the time doesn't exist today, or if it does it is not nearly as prominent as it is today.And that is why this movie is so good in a way: It is a time capsule, a movie so in tuned to this very important time in history, and it tells the story not through a documentary on the time, but through a very human story, with actual people that have very serious problems, and have to face the world as it was, with all of it's good and bad. The strength of this movie is in the characterizations, the writing and the acting portray a number of characters, and their interests, sometime good, sometimes bad, sometimes indifferent, and they come together so flawlessly to put such a great movie together.There's the wife who doesn't like what her husband is doing, the department store manager who gives Frederick March a low paying job, and doesn't appreciate at all that he fought for his country, the bank president who is reluctant to give loans to military families who need and deserve money so much, the axis sympathizer, and so many more, the diversity of the people here is amazing, and while there is so much going on the movie seems so focused, so singular, and the results is a spectacular movie.The leads do an excellent job, Frederick March as the disillusioned and troubled veteran, Dana Andrews as the wealthy veteran who is trying his best to help all of those around him, and upset by what he finds, Harold Russell, who actually lost his arm in World War 2, plays a man who did so, and he works perfectly for the movie. musician Hoagy Carmichael has a small but nice part as well, and Myrna Loy turns in a great performance too. This movie almost flawlessly captures the time, the essence of the era, as few movies can.There is really not a weakness in this movie, it is fun to watch, sad, funny, everything a movie should be, and the greatest thing about this movie, as few movies did, the movie does not have a truly happy ending, you don't know where their lives are going to go, some good things happen and some bad things happen, it just ends, and it's a very open ending, so it kinda shows you that so much is happening in the world, and this movie can't resolve it. This is one of the best movies ever made, William Wyler did a masterful job directing this movie, kudos to him and everyone that was involved in this movie.",

The Best Years of Our Lives is the finest movie I have ever seen. It is so close to flawless as to be unbelievable. I could write effusive paragraphs of praise under each of the following topics: direction, cinematography, lighting, editing, acting, and writing. But I will limit myself to one topic: emotional involvement.The writing, directing, and acting add up to (almost impossibly) more than the sum of their parts. The effect is to draw the viewer into the the three interlocking stories to a frightening degree. This film packs such an emotional wallop that you will probably choke up at the least during one of the many moving scenes.I personally relate most strongly to the character of Fred Derry. Los Angeles has too many Marie types and not enough Peggys. Are there any Peggys left?Since I've seen the film, I ask every WWII vet their opinion of it. They all pipe up quickly and give praise, which, for the \"silent generation\", speaks volumes.Whenever I get the feeling that the pursuit of acting and film-making is ignoble, immature and self-centered, I watch The Best Years of Our Lives and remember what can be done.If you have not seen this movie and are a mature person of substance, then you have a unique experience ahead of you.",

I rented it because I saw the stacks of Oscars it received and it's placement on the AFI's list. And I had never heard of the movie until it popped up on my recommendations radar at Netflix.It's a surprisingly long film, clocking in at almost three hours, but I have to credit the filmmakers, as it really didn't seem that long as I was watching it. All in all, this film really just has classic Hollywood all over it, complete with classic Hollywood direction, acting, etc. From beginning it end, it's smoothly directed, capably acted and has a developed enough script that I didn't lose patience with it much.Having seen plenty of movies from this era, the one shocker to me (and probably to the audiences of the time) was the implication of divorce and marriagebreaking. Outside of that, the story is just a human drama about men returning from the war and the problems some of them encounter in readjusting. It's not a terribly complicated film and spends a lot of time with the three principle characters and following their lives, which intersect at many points. This allows the viewer to get connected.Still, in the end, I can't love the film and that's really no fault of the film. It's just a specific film made for a specific audience, which I don't fall under. While I understand the drama, it isn't as relevant to me. It's still solid enough throughout that I can recommend it, if you have the nearly three hours necessary to watch it. 8/10.",

These aspects have been channeled through 3 different characters, and are in totally different lives but somehow they cross paths.

All three live in the same town and as they fly home in a military plane, they get in front to watch the USA go by beneath them.Fredric March is the banker, Al Stephenson, who comes home to his wife, Myrna Loy as Milly Stephenson, and his two almost grown kids. The daughter is Teresa Wright as Peggy Stephenson, and she eventually gets entangled with the Captain.Dana Andrews is the Captain, Fred Derry. He has a wife but she apparently has been running around on him while he was being a war hero, and their marriage appears headed for a crash.The surprise of the movie is newcomer Harold Russell, a real military veteran who lost both hands while training soldiers, as Homer Parrish, the sailor who comes home with hooks where his hands used to be. He has a girl back home, but now he doesn't believe he can expect her to cope with his disability.Adding a musical touch, and his natural acting, is Hoagy Carmichael as Butch Engle, owner of a popular local hangout and a relative of Homer's.This movie was made to highlight some of the issues returning war veterans faced. Not only was employment often an issue, but also the state of those who they come home to. Plus, war has changed the men, and that provides additional challenges. Good movie.",

In fact, movies of this time have become commonplace for Vietnam.  But the original one of these, and the best, is a World War II one.  It is long, and complex, combining the stories of three men.  But, in the end, despite its large scale story, it provides a personal, intimate look at each of there lives.Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) is a young captain who returns to find that his talents as a bombardier are of no use to him back home, and that his marriage now isn't what it used to be.  Al Stephenson (Frederic March) returns to a family and a job, but now has a cynical attitude towards all of it.  Homer Parrish (Harold Russell) lost his hands during the war.  While his family is ready to accept it, he is not.The movie is an incredibly fascinating, heartfelt look at three men and their struggles to return to their normal lives.  The characters each have their unique problems, and the audience can sympathize with every one of them, as well as with many of the family member who must also deal with their struggles.Few movies have been made that are as moving as this one.  It never falls to the level of being manipulative or overwrought.  It simply tells the stories as they are and lets the viewer fall into it.  A superb film, the best of its kind.**** out of ****",

However, the film spins into a higher gear with the ride home. A brilliantly handled scene depicting the reluctance to finally come home again. And then it is one brilliantly played scene after another. Moving, but not overly sentimental, realistic, but not gritty. It is the sort of film that makes you want to reset you memories to see it again for the first time. A+",

I first caught this movie at age 13, and it has since shared my #1 spot with a few of its fellow \"Best Picture\" winners. Extremely controversial during its time for its brutal honesty in portraying the faults of its heroes, this film never loses its luster.

The movie follows their challenges as they try to readjust to civilian life after overseas service.The film is notable for its treatment of then-controversial subjects. Al has a drinking problem; Marie (Virginia Mayo) and Fred Derry are adulterers; Homer lost his hands in the war and has prosthetic arms; Marie and Fred get divorced; and Homer has psychological problems after losing his hands and becomes a recluse. These were subjects that not many movies would even touch in the mid-1940s, but this film handles these issues with great class.Al's wife and daughter are played by the wonderful actresses Myrna Loy and Teresa Wright. The movie is also sprinkled with other fine actors, including Marie's boyfriend Cliff (Steve Cochran), the old pharmacist Bullard (Erskine Sanford), Al's boss Mr. Milton (Ray Collins), Homer's girlfriend Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell), Wilma's father (Don Beddoe), Homer's concerned dad (Walter Baldwin), and many, many others.Dramatic and touching with gentle touches of humor and Hugo Friedhofer's unforgettable score, \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" should be required viewing for any movie fan. The film portrays American life just as it was in 1946, with millions of servicemen returning home to uncertain futures. The movie is just as fresh, timely, and watchable as it was 68 years ago.

            "content": "This is one rather fine and almost 3 hour long epic running drama, that focuses around 3 WW II veterans from the same town, going back home after the war had ended.It's a real interesting and subtly made drama, that isn't ever being melodramatic but always realistic and compelling with its themes and emotions. The movie handles some great subjects, especially for its time. You have to consider that this movie got made really just after the war had ended. Yet it already handles some of the themes war WW II veterans and also lots of later war veterans had to deal with. The world, their families and themselves all changed, with brings along some at times devastating effects but also often some hopeful things. They have to pick up their 'normal' lives again, with a job, their wives and the rest of their families. It shows how the veterans were often being treated and looked upon. This isn't just a movie glorifying the WW II veterans but also one that has the guts to be bold and straight-forward, by showing life how it truly is but never without the respect those deserve who all fought in the second world war.I guess you still have to be an American though to fully appreciate this movie. You could say that this movie is a real Americana one, filled with pride and hope, for and about a generation, that should make American's feel warm from the inside. Not that the movie is being overly patristic or anything, it's just pride in a good and understandable way, that is still best appreciated by American's themselves.The movie is being quite epic, mostly due to its long running time. Director William Wyler used its long running time to slowly set up its characters to build up the right themes and emotions for the movie. It makes \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" effective as a genre movie and perhaps still more accessible and less sappy than some of the other similar dramatic movies made during the same decade.It's of course also really a real actors movie. Luckily the movie has some great actors in it, such as Fredric March, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright and Dana Andrews. Real WW II veteran and amputee Harold Russell attracted the most attention at the time and even took home two Oscar's for his one role in this movie. He received a special award dedicated to him 'for bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance'. He lost both of his hands during the war due to exploding TNT during an exercise and ever since used hooks to get around. It's amazing how well he got around with them and how much he still could manage with it, without the help of others. This is mostly what earned him the Oscar because in all honesty I sincerely doubt that he would had won an Oscar otherwise. It's not like he is bad but he just wasn't a real actor anyway and also only appeared in just a few movies throughout his life.Simply a great genre movie, that also still applies this present day with all of its themes.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

What a choice that is!  It took me all summer of thought and relooking a some flicks before I made my decision.  It is \"THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES\". This movie has no flaws.  It is one movie in which each one of the minor characters part and dialog is essential to the whole story.  There is not a single part in the film which could be left out.  The young girl's fixation with her brothers lack of hands, the man coming home to young adult children who have grown up without him and with different ideas, the portrayal of a young man whose only responsiblity was as a soda jerk who became the leader of a group of men, and was awarded medals for his action.  A women who must now adjust to the husband who's life has been away from her for years.  The realization of the folks who were in the safety of there secure homes of the sacrifices these ordinary men made in their behalf. The look into the life of loving and living with a man without hands.  A parents first look and reaction to their son's new deformities.  A man used to making life and death decision in a instant, having to return to the way of plodding though a conservative bank's loan structure.  This is no sympathetic, tear jerking, heart strumming act. THIS WAS REAL LIFE!  It could not have been portrayed any different.  This, my friends, is HOW IT WAS!!  This could easily be considered a documentary.   In this day of color film, please do not be turned off by the black and white because it is one of the finest B/W filming, editing and directing you will ever see.  The casting was perfect.

It has excellent direction & production. It uses more drama than action though it has just enough action to enhance the drama. This is a movie which you get more out of each time you watch it. How Wyler frames this story is classic.What really makes the film great is a story that pulls in a viewer because of it's subject. The story is how did the returning vets of World War 2 deal with their war experiences, & how did it effect them. It runs multiple story lines through more of an ensemble cast than was prevalent in other films of its time. It does everything right.Later on the closest the Vietnam generation has to this is the film COMING HOME - but this Wyler film is done much better. You really feel like you know the characters in this film. This film deals with how people from several walks of life were dealing with the after war experience.Among the excellent story lines is one vet dealing with the loss of his arms in the war and trying to adjust. There is an officer dealing with having to struggle as employers do not count his war experiences as a marketable job skill for peace time. There is a loan officer at a bank and how he is touched by both of these folks & other returning vets.There is the scene which seems remote now, but is still haunting, of a vet walking through the grave yard of military planes built for the war parked on a seemingly endless field, being haunted by the images of the equipment and his own war experiences flooding back into his head as he looks at it. In addition to Wyler's Chariot race in 1959's BEN HUR, this scene is to me just as powerful & memorable in this film for a whole set of other reasons.If every film were made as well as this one was, I could never leave the theater.",

It is surprisingly modern for its time in the way it depicts the moral and emotional hangover that always follows war, while at the same time being very compassionate toward its main characters and really celebrating what's most beautiful and idealistic about Americans. If you can get past some rather corny acting by the younger females (Myrna Loy is, as always, outstanding as the older guy's wife), and if you'll have some patience with its sort of low-key approach to post-traumatic stress disorder, you'll find a real and thoughtful movie treasure that stays with you a long time after the movie's over.",

It wasn't until way later, when as a human I have mentally matured and grown, that I began seeing the beauty in art that seemed unappealing to younger generations. This movie, despite its old age, coming out in 1946, this film's message will be useful for years to come. I find films and books that contain lessons of life similar to the Bible. The ability to use storytelling to impact someones life in a sort of positive way is beautiful.With over two hours and fifty minutes of screen time, there is definitely a lot to take in. That is alright though because some movies are complex and contain so much information for your brain to analyze that you may need to watch it several times. There are three main stories being told with all similar lessons. Most stories or plots you hear have one thing in common; the audience watches how the main characters progress physically and most importantly, mentally. The first story I want to talk about is with Homer. A young sailor who went away to work in the lower level of the carrier ships. His ship went under and while 400 of his brothers died, he made it out. At a price though, his hands were burned off. These type of horrible indirect tragedies happen very often in war. Now as he returned home he has to worry about living with prosthetic hands and if his girl will still love him. This story is a lesson about accepting your imperfections and how the others who do the same are the type of people to surround yourself with. He lives in bitterness and fear of being unaccepted at first. He shuts her out and refuses to talk about how he feels. Eventually throughout the story, his character grows and learned not to take her for granted and he married her.The second story is about a Sergeant who also just returned from the war. He also returned on the same plane as Homer. I will get into how their stories interconnect later on. The Sergeant returns home to his family who he hasn't seen in a while. He gets a warm welcome and begins looking for work. But his story is more subtle and internal. He learns to see the value in people, like their character and work effort, more than actual materialistic ownership. This is how we lead to the third story, a bomber who just returned home to an unloyal wife who doesn't appreciate her husband for who he has, and sees him as a bum because he doesn't make as much money anymore. He loses interest in him slowly and is very unfair to him. This puts a lot of stress on the bomber, however he also flew back from the wear on the same plane as the Sergeant and the sailor. The first night they all got drunk together because they all had a hard time readjusting to they're civilian lives. Their bonds, slowly growing, will eventually play a big role in their lives. They helped each other out through aches struggles of returning to normal life and its beautiful to see people treat each other with kindness. Homer relies on the two others for moral support and self-confidence to build up the courage to Mary is love. The Sergeant saw how hard these other veterans are trying to work to be useful in society and live normal lives after watching Homer thrive. The bomber met the Sergeant's daughter the very first night back and she eventually fell in love with him and married him after the bomber was divorced by his wife.It really is a story about how everything happens for a reason. you have to trust the process and things will get better. It also is a huge lesson how love and kindness really is the answer to peace and happiness.",

I couldn't help but notice that alcoholism was always lurking in the background, but it was shown as a mildly funny or potentially embarrassing problem, rather than a serious, destructive addiction. I think the movie meant to show it as a serious problem, but that's not how it came across. Still, I enjoyed the film and highly recommend it, so I give it 8 stars.",

There's always something to admire and to appreciate once again when it's on. Check out the many creative scene set-ups and the flow of the camera, especially the scenes involving mirrors and other artistic framing. Also, the deep focus shots, too. Quite a lesson in creative directing and innovative camera technique on its own.And then -- there is Myrna Loy! Something about that coy, knowing, impetuous smile/smirk and those big expressive eyes,reminiscent of \"The Thin Man\" series, gets me every time. What a wonderful wife to have!(p.s.- Teresa Wright always reminds me of a younger Donna Reed, too.)",

I believe this film, told through the lives of three returning servicemen after World War II, encapsulates the fears and hopes of all such men who returned home to find their lives changed forever.For me the defining moments are the scenes where Fred Derry's father reads out the citations that his son has received for the medals won in air operations over Germany,a great honour but useless in peacetime, and where Fred himself is sitting in the nose of the derelict B-17 quite literally at the crossroads in his life, knowing that he cannot return to the glory days and the future appears to hold nothing for him. Most returnees adapted to new ways, new jobs and in some cases (as in the film) new relationships. Sadly some did not, and their wartime experiences would for them be the Best Years of Their Lives.",

That fact along with the three-hour runtime of the film made me a little apprehensive. A film needs to be pretty great to make me want to pay attention for such a length and given that I'd never heard of it, my expectations weren't very high going in. \n What I did think was that it seemed like a brave venture; coming out just a short while after the Second World War this film looks at how war can negatively impact a soldiers state of mind. Not to mention it was surrounded by war movies filled with adventure and heroics. Watching the film, I realised that it wasn't the \"pretty great\" I needed to make me want to stick around, however it was enjoyable. Most importantly, it never felt like a slog - in fact I found myself quite surprised when the credits rolled. The fact that it never felt three hours long is a point in its favour. \n \nWas it a brave film? In theory, yes. Based off of IMDB's plot description, yes. In actuality, no.\n Whilst the film touched upon many very real issues that were (and still are) faced by soldiers returning home, I felt that they were sidelined pretty quickly in favour of the romance plot-line, in which two of veterans played critical roles. However the third veteran, the one with the most to say on post-war struggles given that he was an amputee, isn't important to the romantic sub-plot and has significantly less screen-time than the other two. \n Of course, those two still face their own post-war issues, however they seem to forget them pretty quickly.PROS:-The Acting: The acting in this film was by far the best thing about. Everyone seemed to fit perfectly into their roles and there was no performance I felt was under-delivered. When any of the three main gentleman are on screen together the acting really sticks out and those were some of the most enjoyable moments in the film. The Music: Music really helps to hold this film together and is used to great effect when acting as a scene-transition. It also doesn't feel intrusive and feels as though it belongs in the scene, unlike some other films from this same era. The Writing: This is a film based around character interactions and they are done wonderfully and you can tell the cast had fun playing their characters. Even during the more somber character interactions, they are written flawlessly and makes the film feel very grounded, no doubt helped by the set design and costumes. CONS:The Plot: I can't think of a great many flaws in this movie, but I can easily think of one and it is perhaps the biggest flaw a film can have. As I mentioned above, this film is about character interactions. No matter how good those character interactions are they do not carry a film of this length, it must also have a compelling plot-line. This film falls short on that front. There weren't a whole lot of moments that spring to mind as \"memorable\" and if I were caught-off guard I imagine I would struggle to recap the events of the film, even at the time of writing this review three hours after watching. There is also the aspect I mentioned earlier in regards to the post-war difficulties being put to the side for a more clich\u00e9 romance story. This film could easily have been an hour shorter and due to the lack of a strong plot, it gets a lower rating than it perhaps could have. For every one thing I enjoyed about the film, there were 2 scenes that were completely inconsequential to the overall narrative. \n On top of that, the most compelling character in the film is the one with the least story and the film never really delivered on demonstrating issues faced by soldiers coming home. \n What they did show, however, was important. That is what this film is and what this film was - important, especially during its time. There would have been many people going through a lot of the stuff that the three soldiers went through and this film showed to them that they weren't alone. Seeing even the most downtrodden characters lives improve throughout the film also allowed them to hope, when some of them may not have had the will for it.",

The Road Back tells the experience of young men in Germany who have returned from World War I and are trying to rehabilitate back into the society.\"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is a similar story even though it does not have a very strong attitude towards war. It tells the story of three ex-servicemen (an airman, a sergeant, and a sailor) who have been trying to integrate back into society.While each one is trying to sort their life out,Fred (the airman) has come to realize that his wife who took a job as a night club waitress while he was overseas doesn't really love him.Al(sergeant)who developed a drinking problem in the army gets a promotion in the bank he used to work but he has had to struggle for the loan rights of the ex-servicemen.Homer(the sailor) cannot seem to face with his situation of losing his hands at the war and he doesn't want to tie his longtime girl Wilma to himself because of that. During their laudable struggles we see Wilma talking the sailor into marriage,Fred falling in love with the sergeant's daughter and Al's efforts to try to catch up on the growth of his son and daughter.The performance of Harold Russell, who lost both hands in the war and played an amputee is really commendable.He absolutely deserves to be \"the only actor to receive two Academy Awards for the same performance.\" Actually there is a little bit latent praise on heroism and war in the movie.For example in a scene where the sailor Homer is offered some sundae by Fred who is working at the drugstore a guy approaches the sailor and implies he lost his hands for nothing and Homer is offended with some sort of exclamation \"Some Americanism!So we're all a bunch of suckers?So we should've been on the side of the Japs and the Nazis?\". I just did not feel that the director reflected enough attitude against war.It just feels like he kinda supported Homer's mindset.Of course the movie succeeds in reflecting harsh situation of the post-bellum life of veterans. We can see that they feel alienated,aloof and detached from their normal life and their loved-ones but it just doesn't fit right if you do not take an open side against war and its harsh realities and harms.",

In the scene of the nervous homecoming of the sergeant-banker, (supposedly reflecting Wyler's own post-war return to his wife), the blocking and balance is as precise and evocative as that of a great painting. The fine balance of joy and anxiety projected by March and Loy in their quiet scenes illustrates classic American film acting and directing.  The scene in Butch's bar, as Homer plays the piano,Al looks anxiously on, and in the background Fred calls Al's daughter to break her heart and his, is an amazing piece of deep focus film construction, telling three stories at once and interconnecting them emotionally.

            "content": "The Best Years Of Our Lives (1946) -This was a very slow going film and in many ways it did seem a little bit forced.Personally I could appreciate Homer's (Harold Russell) story more easily, as it had that extra layer of depth and heart to it, although it was easy to see the message that the film was trying to send about the adjustments a returning soldier would have had to make and those that their families would have had to make too, which was represented in the storylines of Al Stephenson (Fredric March) and Fred Derry (Dana Andrews).I have frequently had to manage different groups of friends as I've moved through my life and career, with many falling along the wayside, so I could understand the difficulties of integrating old friends from home with the new ones that understood the experience that only the 3 lead fellas had gone through. Although I could never know the horror that these soldiers must have faced of course.But it seemed a bit like metaphorically talking to old friends about one job in a garage, while my new office based friends were oblivious to what was so funny about old Mr Magoo's rattling sound in the trunk, that turned out to be his old false teeth. One group would always feel left out.As for the cast, they all did well and Dana Andrews in particular was quite nice to look at.However, I did have to wonder if Harold Russell would have received his Oscar's if he hadn't been the only one playing an otherwise abled character in film at that time. Don't get me wrong, he played the part carefully and appropriately and I respect his abilities to live his life regardless, he was far more mobile and with a far more positive attitude than my own, but I didn't see an outstanding performance from him, that I would expect the little gold man to be given out for.Other than that I found it difficult to believe Rob Stephenson (Michael Hall) was of school age, because he was quite a big lad, even at 19, but it didn't effect the main plot too much, except that I did have to question where he disappeared to in all the affairs that followed.In general it was a good film, but the sheer length of it was tiring, especially as it didn't really say much more than it's message about the trials of returning home, which had been well established from the offset.They did try to incorporate some ups and downs and emotional moments, but there was nothing to really excite the story. As such it was JUST a good film.482.76/1000.",

They're each from the same town, but otherwise they couldn't be more different in their war careers, origins, current occupations and future prospects. This movie is their story as their lives intermix and they all have to learn how to deal with normal life after the ravages of war.The filming for this movie began only seven months after the war and the movie actually contains an actual war veteran as one of its main characters. Harold Russell lost both of his hands in a training accident during the last years of the war, and likewise his character, Homer Parrish, has to deal with the loss. Truth be told, it took me a while to realize they had actually gotten an amputee for the role. I kept praising the special effects, especially for such an old movie...Details like that certainly give the film an authentic vibe, but then again, not a lot of time had passed since the war, and the long-term horrors and symptoms these men would have to fave had yet to surface. As such it's a bit of an idyllic version of what would happen, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't pleasant to watch.Especially because the film is written and acted so well. I liked all of these characters, with special mention going to Peggy Stephenson (Teresa Wright). I liked how they could, despite their engulfing differences, look each other in the eye, find something that echoes and treat each other as equals.

I mean, Wyler and Sherwood could easily have gone all Stanley Kramer/Abby Mann on us and made a ponderous \"problem\" pic with lots of worthy, vaguely liberal pronouncements and soapboxy speeches on the Plight Of Returning Vets. But with a couple exceptions...Al Stephenson's concluding remarks in his drunken speech about morality in banking being the most egregious...this is definitely and thankfully a movie about three people, with virtues and flaws, returning from war rather than three symbols of troubled peacetime adjustment.2) Of the fine cast Dana Andrews seems to get better the more often I see it (at least 20 times). Andrews is one of those under rated thesps who tended toward the \"less is more\" school of acting and thus tended to disappear into the overall pattern of the film, especially when he has to share the space with such giants as Frederic March and Myrna Loy. Maybe this is why the guy shamefully never got an Oscar nomination, let alone an award. Sure shoulda gotten one or the other, though, for his portrayal of Fred Derry, the most pathetic and self destructive of the three vets and the one whose fate is left most up in the air by film's end.3) While Andrews gets better over time, Teresa Wright's star, for me, diminishes. She's still quite good as the thoughtful, considerate, if smug at times Peggy but her acting, particularly in the scenes with Loy and March, descends into the realms of the too sentimental that the rest of the cast largely avoids.4) This film has many memorable scenes but there are two brilliant set pieces where the three main stories, Fred, Homer and Al's, come together. One is at the beginning when the three are in the nose of a bomber flying across post WW2 America. Inner conflicts that they are undergoing are set up and ironically intertwined with images of an outwardly calm and prosperous USA. The other is Homer and Wilma's wedding at film's end where the seeming happiness of the newly married couple is juxtaposed with Fred and Peggy's uncertain future and Al and Milly's loving but sometimes difficult union. Both of these riveting sequences serve to remind us that the best films (and novels, for that matter) leave us somewhere between hopeful and uncertain.5) This film is nearly three hours long and feels half that. Bravo Willie Wyler!6) My favorite line in the film comes from a very subsidiary character, Woody Merrill, Peggy's date at the nightclub foursome with them and the Derrys. In analyzing the failure of Fred and Marie's marriage Woody opines, \"just one small problem. They don't like each other.\"7) In the timely reminder that no film's perfect dept: Cathy O'Donnell sucks!",

William Wyler and Robert Sherwood manage to interweave the inter-connected tales poignantly, illustrating the frustrations, bordering on despair, not only of the three men - in completely different ways; but also of their respective partners who must also adjust to their return, and to their new circumstances once the war is has been won. There are some strong performances from their ladies too - Myrna Loy and Teresa Wright, less so the always rather wooden Virginia Mayo and by the end you do have some, slight, semblance of an idea of just how tough it was for these men to lose the security and discipline of their army lives and to cope with a life that has, in many cases, just moved on without them.",

The Best Years of Our Lives is a complex film in a sense that it is intricately honest about its political restraints and yet applies the same careful consideration to both the entertaining dramatic facade and underlying it social context.Running time of over 170 minutes turns The Best Years of Our Lives into a 'domestic epic'- film of subtle pleasures and intervening relationships focused on the mundane but extended into the proportions usually reserved for stories of much more grandiose scale. Yet initially balanced perspectives shift dangerously and for lengthy periods of time character of Homer is pushed into the background. Played by an actual disabled veteran, Homer adds a level of harsh realism that is unexpected for a Hollywood film of that period. All three veterans, levelled only briefly by a shared anxiety of returning to their families are constantly challenged by their different economical positioning, but strangely disproportionated by the narrative's momentum.Wyler's film reveals itself to be a melodrama, in most natural way evolving from the struggle for readjustment into a love affair and it thrives on sentimentality. This notion dominates the tone of the whole with a pleasurable alas predictable manner, leading to an ending that seems to be entirely satisfied with its shmalzy quality. Film is simply most comfortable in this familiar territory, once the obstacle of the controversy- Al's contradictory intentions at work, Fred's unemployment and Homer's disability become merely a set up. At one point Homer's sacrifice comes under blunt questioning but the villainous gentleman who dares to display his doubt is brutally dispatched- questionable necessity of war dismissed in favour of the future prosperity; an optimism of blindfolded conformity. This suspension of criticism is film's dominant mode.Staged and executed with precision, film utilizes, infamously, deep focus to achieve a level of undeniable verity. It is hard to dismiss it as only a technical nuisance and although one should be extremely careful to seek Bazinian inclinations of dominance in this particular form, The Best Years of Our Lives is a thoroughly impressive achievement. Depth of every shot provokes a curiosity that is often rewarded through reoccurring use of reflections and significant details that would otherwise require editing, disturbing film's considerate pace.Verdict: It's a classic that is as enjoyable a movie now as it might have been in 1946 but even more interesting as a story of a significant compromise. One between the urge for reassessment in a mass medium not quite ready for this kind of impact and a story that could support the interest of a broad audience- disillusionment and patriotism. More a mark of its times than perhaps any other Classical Hollywood venture, The Best Years of Our Lives is an example of a film that lost none of its excellence and purely emotional impact even if it intellectually resonates in a rather underwhelming way.",

Recently, it has begun to get recognition as perhaps the most even-handed representation of soldiers' integration into post-war life ever made (and that most definitely includes films such as \"The Deer Hunter.\") I like it, but my overall evaluation is somewhere between those extremes.The tale is a simple one. Three very different servicemen who have mustered out after World War II (The Big One!) fly home to their Midwest town and try to resume, or create, civilian lives. One has a disability, one has a cushy job waiting for him, and the other has nothing to go on but determination.There are some good but unfortunately uneven performances. Fredric March won the Best Actor Oscar for playing an old Sergeant who returns to his job at the local bank. Personally, I think Jimmy Stewart deserved it for \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" which also deserved the Best Picture Award, but clearly this film touched a nerve with the post-war audience. As I said, it was fashionable. March has one fantastic scene, a humorous speech that brought to mind somewhat similar incident involving real WWII hero Pappy Boyington, and otherwise is solid but unspectacular.I am going against the grain here, but I thought that Myrna Loy, who played March's wife, was justly ignored by the Academy. I detected barely a hint of warmth from her. In fact, I kept thinking she was going to slap Frederic March for annoying her. She practically grimaced every time they were together. Something was definitely missing there, in her forced smiles and her air of tolerance rather than joyfulness. I think all this nonsense about her being \"the perfect wife\" is correct only if you think a passionless 1950s homemaker is your ideal. You may disagree with that, but the Academy voters apparently did not. She is a major problem with this film, terribly miscast.Dana Andrews as a former soda jerk who became a war hero, then winds up behind the counter again, is amazing. He is saddled with a wife who evidently married him right before he left for the war for all the wrong reasons, and his future looks bleak. But then he chances upon March's daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright, in a fantastic turn), and fireworks explode. Both are great, but then comes that unevenness again that pervades this film. Some moments of pure soap opera intrude, punctuated by the all-time classic line, \"I'm going to bust that marriage up!\" The romance is uplifting and does mirror a common condition after the war, that of returning servicemen finding love upon their return.Speaking of uplifting, now we come to Harold Russell. He has a naturalistic quality to his acting, or is it non-acting, that rings just as true today as it no doubt did then. Taking a no-nonsense approach to his situation, he is an inspiration. His best scene, one of the best in all cinema, is when he brings the girl who likes him up to his bedroom to show her the truth of his condition. \"I'm lucky, I still have my elbows unlike some of the boys.\" Truly great stuff.The film has some moments that soar. It also has some moments that belong in the afternoon soaps. Take the good with the bad and see this one for the high points.",

This is the case with \"The deer hunter\" (1978, Michael Cimino), \"Full metal jacket\" (1987, Stanley Kubrick and most certainly also for \"The best years of our lives\" (1946, William Wyler). Together with \"Mrs Miniver\" (1942) Wyler has made two of those excellent war movies.In \"The best years of our lives\" three men try to pick up again their civil lives after the war, only to discover that society puts little value on the experience they have obtained in the army. The film illustrates this with concrete examples. Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) can come back by his former employer as the assistent of his former subordinate because his war time experience is \"not relevant\". Al Stepehenson (Fredric March) as a bank employee has to give more weigh to the value of the collateral than to the personality of the applicant when deciding about the request for a loan by a veteran. It is no coincidence that, when walking om a terrain with old jet fighters Fred Derry feels himself just as discarded as these planes.Most touching however are the experiences of Homer Parrish (Harold Russell), who is very afraid that after losing both his arms in the war the relationship with his girl friend shall solely be based on pity.",

It was the part where the war dissenter in the drug store was voicing his opposition to American involvement in WWII to Dana Andrew's character. My generation, and those succeeding, were taught that U.S. participation in WWII was a just and necessary undertaking. I was surprised to see that such a controversial scene reflecting the national trauma of losing hundreds of thousands of American lives would be represented in the way that it was so soon after the war. No doubt there were thousands of gold star mothers from that era who saw the movie. I often wondered what was their reaction to that scene. I respected it's honesty.

The non-stop music, most of the time, totally unnecessary but usually were simply over-the-top annoying. I think it had originated from the silent movies, all the scenarios, plots, stories...had to use the music to express or emphasize, so that ended up when the early movies progressed to have sound recording, the traditional music would have naturally adapted into the movies with sound, then cartoons by Disney invented, the soundtracks simply couldn't stop. But those movies with such annoying non-stop music/scores would have only ruined them in the end.

From Sherwood's exceptional screenplay to the marvelous, yet beautifully understated, ensemble acting; from Wyler's\ufeff adroit direction and the superb cinematography of Gregg Toland (employing the deep focus photography he perfected with \"Citizen Kane\"), to the magnificent score by Hugo Friedhofer (amongst the finest ever written for the screen), this picture is a snapshot of our republic that would have moved the Founders to tears. A film deeply imbued with humanity and decency, experiencing it cannot but make one a better human being.After Francis Goldwyn read an article entitled \"The\ufeff Way Home\" in the 7 August, 1944, edition of Time magazine on the travails of servicemen returning to civilian life from the war, she showed it to her husband, producer Samuel Goldwyn; he was also deeply affected and decided to make a picture about the issues raised. Goldwyn hired writer, newspaperman and former war correspondent MacKinlay Kantor to write an original story, which became the best-selling blank-verse novella \"Glory for Me\" (1945); he would later win a Pulitzer Prize for his Civil War novel\ufeff \"Andersonville.\" Goldwyn then turned to playwright Robert E. Sherwood\ufeff to turn Kantor's story into a screenplay. Former Director of War Information and speech-writer for FDR (it was he who coined the phrase that became \"the arsenal of democracy\"), Sherwood had already won three of his four Pulitzer Prizes and was himself no stranger to the cinema (he had co-written the screenplay for Hitchcock's first American film, \"Rebecca,\" 1940). The result was titled \"The Best Years of Our Lives.\" Himself fresh out of the service, William Wyler was an ideal choice for director. Commissioned a major in the U.S. Army Air Corps, Wyler flew actual combat missions while making two classic documentaries, \"The Memphis Belle\" (1943) and \"Thunderbolt\" (1944). His courage while filming under extreme and life-threatening conditions earned him an Air Medal - and promotion to Lieutenant Colonel. From the moment the film's opening credits begin to roll, Hugo Friedhofer's extraordinary music sets the emotional stage for the story about to unfold. Conducted by Franco Collura leading the London S.O., a superb re-recording of the complete Oscar-winning score was made in 1978 and released by Preamble on Lp; the CD was issued in 1988. Preamble is no longer\ufeff extant, but the Australian 'Label X' obtained the rights and reissued a new digital transfer from the original master tapes in the best sound to date.",

            "content": "The Vietnam War brought the issue of PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) to the forefront of people's minds. In today's combat, PTSD is a topic that is regularly explored. PTSD is nothing new, but its thematic exploration is only recent. However, there happens to be an honest, intelligent film depicting PTSD from before Vietnam...during World War II. That particular film is William Wyler's The Best Years of Our Lives. The film began production a mere seven months after the war ended and Wyler wanted to bring an honest, authentic feeling to his movie. He even had the principal actors buy their own clothes. At nearly three hours long, you don't feel the time passing. Wyler, the man behind Wuthering Heights and Ben-Hur, immerses his audience into his film with a timely topic, impressive, well-developed characters, and a wonderful film score composed by Hugo Friedhofer.\nBig-time American producer Samuel Goldwyn came up with this film's idea when reading about veterans returning from abroad and trying to adjust from a Times article. He hired a former war correspondent to write a screenplay which was turned into a novella. Furthermore, Robert Sherwood adapted the current film's screenplay from that novella. Sherwood's script is impressive because its honest with the terms of how hard it is for veterans to readjust themselves to society...brutally honest sometimes. Wyler was hired to direct, as he flew a few missions himself during the war. Authenticity was very important to him. Instead of creating grand sets as accustomed to during this time period, he created lifelike sets. He also went out of his way to hire a non-actor, Harold Russell, to play one of the returning veterans. He happens to be the only actor to win two Academy Awards for the same performance (best supporting actor and an honorary award). He also worked with cinematographer Gregg Toland to come up with rather impressive well-focused shots.\nThis movie depicts the lives of three soldiers returning home from the war to different lives but somehow connected to one another. Al Stephenson (Frederic March) returns to his influential banking position but comes to realize that being loyal to his fellow soldiers may not be a good thing. Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) is just your typical, ordinary man that works hard for a living. He realizes how hard it is to find or hold down a job. Homer Parrish (Harold Russell) has both of his hands burned away during combat. He comes home unsure if his family and especially his fianc\u00e9 loves him anymore. With these issues in mind, the three men must try and reacclimate themselves to a harsh society.\nThe performances are excellent all across the board, Harold Russell deserves all the credit because he nails it as someone with no acting experience. He sold the idea of having no hands and trying to live in his \"new normal\" very well. His scenes with his fianc\u00e9 are very heartbreaking. Frederic March does a great job and his scenes where he tries to be loyal by approving loans but receiving blowback from the bank in the process is engrossing and likewise heartbreaking. On the supporting end, Myrna Loy and Teresa Wright are fantastic as Al's respective wife and daughter. And Dana Andrews! He had some excellent scenes, especially in the bomber sequence towards the end. One of the reasons why the film worked because each actor delivered a raw, honest portrayal. No gimmicks or anything. Each performance was natural, and the strong writing and direction only elevated these performances.\nWilliam Wyler's The Best Years of Our Lives hit home how horrible war veterans can have it returning home from war whether it be trying to find a job, reuniting with loved ones, etc. After service is completed and the war is over, people seem to forget about these folks-the same folks that defended this country so we Americans can live a life of freedom. Wyler was not afraid to mince words or scenes when trying to push across his themes. It is the same today as it was back in 1945. Readjusting to society while having bouts of PTSD is near impossible without the necessary help and love that is required. This movie is a moving, and hard portrayal about life after war. I definitely give this movie a recommend.\nMy Grade: A",

Sometimes called the \"greatest generation\", the men and women in the movie are a sampling of that demographic who are now passing into history. This movie leaves you with a great sense of satisfaction, not laughs or escapism but takes life as it was for many families and handles it with honesty and intelligence.To start with, the main character performed by Frederick March tries to balance his conscience and responsibilities in a time when change meant moral dilemmas that were not easy to resolve, whether in personal or professional lives. His steadfast wife is Myrna Loy, who is understanding and sometimes critical but fully engaged in his life.All three men in this movie and their loved ones were faced with challenges. In each case, they forced themselves or one another to face up to the task. These involved physical disability, personal relationships, unemployment, and making the transition from the battlefield to the workplace.This movie has humour and fun as well as serious issues. Frederick March's character sets the tone. He doesn't moralize or patronize. He plunges into the fray...advising, chastising, getting angry, laughing or boozing. The other men respect him and he helps bring out the best in them. Dana Andrews, as the war hero whose return to civilian and personal life was almost humiliating, was excellent in his role as was Harold Russell (a non-professional actor) who went from big man in town to double amputee. Theresa Wright and Cathy O'Donnell played the women who salvaged their self-esteem.When all is said and done, these are flawed but good men whose courage is never in doubt. They had the good fortune to find strong women to lean on. With their courage and determination, they are able to move on in their lives, however changed it might be. To me this will always be a great movie. Despite changed times, the movie still has much to say.",

The need to have a happy ending for such a serious topic seems to be where pre-vietnam movies lacked.\nThe few topics addressed include: being treated badly, being misused, family/relationship troubles.\nThese all exist today, and are serious issues.With the love of violence and mass murder of the culture, it makes sense that such a movie was/could have been very popular. The ease of transition for some of them does make the film quite disappointing on further thought.

Her role could have easily been written out as she has precious few motherly or wifely duties, other than to take away intoxicating drinks from her lush husband.Frederic March as Al Stephenson is wooden as a drunk and not an authority figure for his family at all. In only one scene does he prove that he isn't a wimp and that occurs when he tells his daughter to mind her own business and get out of Fred Derry's love life.Teresa Wright as Peggy, the Stephenson's daughter, is talented and polished in all of her scenes, and is one of the few reasons for watching the movie at all though her scene at the end is contrived.Dana Andrews as Fred Derry appears to want to run away from reality in every scene he is in. One can understand why his wife played by Virginia Mayo has so many affairs.Harold Russell is THE reason for watching this movie and deserves the two Oscars he won for playing the role of Homer Parrish, who lost his hands in the war and uses prosthetic 'hooks' remarkably well.When you watch this movie and think about it, the title could have been \"The Worst Years of Our Lives\" and nobody would have known the difference.",

He quietly points at the medals on his chest. He quickly joins up with two others going to Boone, a little town in the midwest: army sergeant Al (Fredric March), and disabled navy man Homer, who gets by with hooks for hands (veteran Harold Russell).They sit in the nose of the plane looking at the landscape - they're flying low. Homer is thrilled by his first plane ride. He's just worried about how his girl will react. The others assure him he'll be fine. Back on the ground, they get a taxi and drop Homer off - he's nervous, but the others order him to get going. Al is dropped off at a fancy apartment block and is reunited with his son, daughter Peggy and too-understanding wife Milly (Myrna Loy). Fred, the officer, goes to his parents' house - a shack near a railroad, and sets out to look for his wife.They all reunite in the evening at Butch's bar (Hoagy Carmichael), drink too much and get a bit riotous (I fast-forwarded, I don't like drunk scenes). The trio have trouble settling in: Fred's wife turns out to have a taste for the good life he can't afford, he gets his old job back but loses it, he falls in love with Al's daughter Peggy...Homer just wants people to treat him as an ordinary person, and won't set a wedding date. He is a naturally happy soul, and if he loses his temper he quickly apologises, but he is suffering.Al goes back to work at the bank but his status is precarious - his jovial employer drops heavy warnings about lending to ex-servicemen without collateral. But of course it all ends happily. Al gives the bank board a drink-fuelled boot up the rear about lending to the right people (couldn't watch this bit either).

It's a story that needed telling but with a three hour run time, it does drag a little.The mundanity and indeed slow pace does give this picture an incredibly authentic feel. You, yourself find that you have been transported to 1946 America with all its difficulties but also all its hopes. That feeling of actually being there is enhanced by Gregg Toland's fabulous deep-focus photography. His cinematography certainly makes this feel like something special.Being so relevant to the lives of everyone in 1946, it's obvious why this had to be so sensitively handled but today it does feel slow and overly sentimental. Nevertheless the uncertainty and optimism of that time is perfectly captured but the lack of edginess doesn't give this picture any real punch.HEROES FOR SALE dealt with similar issues thirteen years earlier (different war of course) but 'one take Wellman' managed to convey so much more drama and outrage in his film in just over an hour making that one massively more engaging. BEST YEARS tries a little too hard to burrow into your emotions. Its structured and formulaic approach channels your perceptions, not allowing you to discover the subtext for yourself. But that's not such a bad thing, following William Wyler's set path, even at such a glacial pace is still an emotional journey worth taking.",

The funny thing is, I always thought that every single returning servicemen were treated with respect, hailed as heroes, saluted wherever they went, but when I saw the scenes where people complain about how they're going to take away the jobs and the man at the counter that says Homer was a sucker....boy, that opened my eyes. I've also always loved romance tales of the serviceman from one place marrying the girl in another state/country, thinking everyone falls and stays in love forever. Then you see Fred and Marie's situation and wow, another eye opener for me. I wonder how many divorces occurred after the men came home from Europe/Japan, etc. Anyway, this movie is great and I always tear up. To me the most touching scene is when Homer is getting ready for bed with help from dad and the camera zooms to his face. You can kind of see the humiliation? of having his father dress him. that just gives me chills. the only little thing that I wondered about was why they show Al and Milly as having a son, but he only comes out like three times in the whole movie...oh well. nothing major compared to the greatness of this movie. thanks for reading!",

            "content": "The Best Years Of Our Lives encapsulates all elements of post war America with a diplomatic style, in that its patriotic thread humours the then conservative Hays Code which informally regulated the morality of the US film industry. This way, the director Willian Wyler can tackle sensitive issues facing post war American society by borrowing elements from the Futurists, an art movement founded by Italian Filippo Tommaso Emilio Marinetti (December 22 1876 - December 2, 1944)which advocated new hope via painful changes. In this respect new post war hopes and aspirations are achieved via the abolition of class, the emancipation of women and divorce in order to continue and re-establish the status quo. The new hope is seen in Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) whose character won't accept the mundane low status job of soda jerk. For him the war brings new opportunities; after all he is a pilot with distinction and he deserves more than being a shop boy. But this hope is juxtaposed with the out dated civilian attitudes of the pre-war period, which seems to want to pick up where things left off prior to the war. This seems prevalent when Fred's boss at the drug store just expects that the former mentioned can slot back easily into his humble role of soda jerk. This proves too much and an event which acts as a catalyst for his frustration culminates in Fred losing his temper (the army not only taught him how to fight, but legitimised it as a defence of masculine pride)with a customer, which ends in his unemployed status. This is more than his wife Maria (Virginia Derry) can take. She has been emancipated, and is free and independent. She finds subordination to the role of the dutiful wife incongruous of her post-war free spirit.The situation of characters Fred and Maria confront the audience with a hint of the social changes to come with the forecast of marriage breakdown (which is symbolic of the deconstruction of a pre-war society which accepted the status quo without too many questions)culminating in divorce (initiated by women) and extra marital affairs. Indeed, the fact that Peggy (Terrasa Wright) with her wholesome middle class ing\u00e9nue image, is declaring herself a 'marraige wrecker' is a sign of the rebellion of young people and their insubordination to their parents and society. By this insubordinate defiance she is symbolic of the social revolution and the decline in naivety and innocence. Moreover Peggy forms a relationship across the social boundary and with one kiss breaks the class system.Harold Russell played the war veteran Homa as himself. His character represents the adjustments and sacrifices that have to be made for everyone's sake during the post war period. This is reinforced by Al Stephenson's (Fredric March) speech at the bank dinner. In this speech Al suggests that the bank needs to take risks to survive and thrive in the post war period. In this respect Al is borrowing (without any conscious intention) from the Futurist Manifesto initiated by Marinetti; that is changes need to be risked, and liberal attitudes adhered to for the bank to remain profitable and become richer. Al's wife Milly (Myrna Loy) remains the stoic, stable force of the women's supporting role in society that in many respects permits the risk taking, and changes to occur.The direction of this film , accomplished by the celebrated William Wyler means the plot detail defies the film's length. In other words the film's length is made less enduring due to the way the interesting soap opera style of plot is accomplished. Kudos goes to all the actors in this award winning film, including an accomplished supporting cast.The Best Years Of Our Lives is a very worth wile film with important social insight and commentary.",

March's character returns to find his children have grown, and he and his wife must get reacquainted with each other all over again. Andrews returns to an unhappy and failing marriage and finds himself no longer in love with his wife. Perhaps the most heartbreaking role in the movie belongs to Harold Russell's character, who returns home from the war with out his hands, made all the more tragic because this paralleled Russells own experience in the war. The Best Years of our Lives won nine Oscars in 1947, including; Best Picture, Best Actor (Fredrick March), Best Supporting Actor (Harold Russell), and also Directing, Film Editing, Musical Score, Sound Recording, Writing, and a special award to Harold Russell \"for Bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance in The Best Years of Our Lives\", which, indecently was the only time in the Academys history that two awards were given to any actor for the same role.

Screenwriter Sherwood's script avoids the mawkishness of Capra's vehicle. Wyler's lingering closeups capturing the complex withheld emotions, often prolonged \"realtime\" shots that allow the inner processes to surface with extraordinary delicacy. The divide between those returning from war and those who waited back home is central to the unfolding narrative (something that resurfaces in the post-Vietnam movies where the social split was even more severe). Witness for example the depth of sincerity and affection between Butch and Homer, less obvious perhaps than the burgeoning love that binds Fred and Peggy Stephenson. We get a critical sense of the loyalty, principles, and human decency of friendship and human bonding that has long since evaporated. And yet, in all its miraculous 2:50 minutes, despite the ample and excellent cast, only two coloured people appear (neither service personnel or civilians): one brown attendant in the women's restroom (seen barely in profile), and a black waiter at the party: in all, barely 20 seconds. Fortunately, nowadays there are young historians who analyze such racial selectivity back through Hollywood history, and they do well. In the 1940s when this film was made the population was nearly 10 percent black, not counting the millions of migrant Hispanics and Asians and so-called mixed-race of second and third generation.

I made a point of viewing it again recently to see if my first impression held up.The bad news is that the actual plot of BEST YEARS veers a bit into soap opera territory. The story is a little mechanical in its attempts to cover as much of the post-WWII experience as possible (and somehow work Hoagy Carmichael into the mix). The good news is that the characters are so damn good that the semi-hokey plot doesn't matter.This is a great American movie, remarkable for its realism and lack of sentimentality. Particularly remarkable was Harold Russell, whose portrayal of double-amputee Homer Parrish was believable and very moving. One of my favorite scenes in this movie is the one where Homer is headed to bed, and needs his father to help take off his prosthetic hands and button his pajama top. There is almost no dialogue, and no dramatic swell of the music, just a quiet, honest, matter-of-fact scene.Some of the details intrigued me. The Stephensons slept together in a double bed--a big no-no in those Hayes-code days--but you never actually saw Mrs. Stephenson there. Other commenters have mentioned here the themes of divorce and domestic discord that were all-but-unheard of at the time.I love that Myrna Loy played a great supporting role in this drama as Millie Stephenson, AND had played Nora Charles in THE THIN MAN, among my favorite comedies.

Main point is thelives with GETTING ADJUSTED TRYING TO GET A JOB, GET MARRIED TRYTO FORGET AND LIVE CIVILIAN LIVES IN A QUAINT HOME TOWN WHEREWOMEN WERE SO RESPECTIVE TOWARDS GUYS, THOSE THAT FOUGHTTHUS WOOED THEM TO THEIR LIKING FOR HOLY MATRIMONY with someTWIST along the way. Yes, not just marriage regardless of religious background \"MARRIAGE\" was considered Sacred before God and Man. I personally notfamiliar of the actors but did FINE ACTING ROLES though movie seemed slowpaced, compared to movie making today. But, for one key actress role  was asmore independent leave her husband to find her own niche in life. Most partswere WOMEN IN TRADITIONAL HOMEMAKING ROLES. Boy, nothing better ina marriage keeping the Flame of LOVE MAKING going and being served withHOME COOKED MEALS by your \"better half female wife.\" Some us guys don'tneed lavished gifts gadgets boy toys like their classy cars high- tech televisions/ computer/audio systems while that may be costly and sterile, I''ll trade that in for loyal faithful submissive practical loving homemaker any day of the week. Hmm! home baked Apple Pie ala mode! This movie IS a 10 in my book, since missedbeginning seem slow and a little uneven, but that may be not seeing the usually setup from the beginning. IN THE LEAGUE OF \"IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE\"caliber, without holiday flavor.10/10. As a traditionalist, yes the is \"The Best Years of Our lives!\"",

With this film, it's easy to lose those things, it is such a well-crafted work.But it is not only the craft that emerges, nor is it the pinpoint perfect performances, nor is it the touching and poignant score--no none of these dominates ones viewing experience. What does is America itself--America in it's purest form, simple, powerful, at times, cruel and indifferent, but always....us. It is the mirror of our own lives, beliefs, and dreams we once held, perhaps still do, that is held up to us, and we are allowed to see ourselves, not as we are, but as we wished to be. America of hope, families, church, and tradition, where all peoples are held as brothers without the burden of a forced and artificial \"ethic of multiculturalism\"; America of \"give the underdog a break,\" (while not being accused of being a socialist); America of good men wet with the sweat of good work, enjoying the freedom given by so many who paid so unflinchingly the ultimate price; indeed, this film presents us with an America that is the very incarnation and essence of the meaning of \"hope,\" the greatest promise of our forefathers, to which they pledged their lives and sacred honor. And each character is faced with the acceptance of that hope. And it is beautiful.If there is ever an award or citation of the \"Most American Film\" it must be this masterpiece. See it as an unabashed American, and hope that America may come back to us in this form.PS - Feb. 17, 2011 - Just found out that this film did NOT make TIME MAGAZINE'S Top 100 Films list. Do we need any more evidence of the stupidity of the mainstream media? Good Lord. But \"Charade,\" did make it. Please.",

            "content": "Brilliant beginning with the tale of 3 soldiers exchanging war stories on their return. The director has taken care of smallest detail of their hopes, dreams and reality. Even the comedy of Al with his Chaplin moustache lightens up their miseries. The smart bloke who questioned war exposed the one-sidedness of the 3 men's naivety. The contrast of Al serving in the bank at thousands vs Fred selling perfume by reading the bottle at $32 a week was hard-hitting. No character was unreasonable and yet they all were. Gambling on depositor's money or gambling on the nation's future- wow, 1940 sounded repeated in the housing bubble crisis of 2008. Americans the optimist gamblers, and the world saviours.The heart-rending dialogues and scenes were by the three leading ladies.The double-hooked sailor's guilt was so lovingly and honestly dealt with by Wilma's statement, 'I will understand you if you let me. And if its too much for me, I will know, but only if you let me try.' - I could use that line in life!My heart goes to Peggy and her mom, who was even more beautiful. I didn't see as much in Fred as Peggy did. Maybe an incident of integrity would have made me love him too. Makes me wonder what kind of mental count i keep on people's virtues.But Mrs. Stevenson, she's swell! She stands out as the most giving, tolerant and loving person in this whole drama. She is the one feeling bad that she didn't have enough drinks in the house, when Al comes unannounced.The fault is in no one, but our stars that cause such PTSDed veterans.",

With that said I would like to mention some of those marvelous supporting players (although some in bit parts) who also contributed in making this film a classic. Who could forget the reaction of Homer's (Harold Russell) parent's played by Minna Gombell and Walter Baldwin when he arrives home after the war minus his hands as they display such sorrowful affection that is extremely touching. His little sister Luella played so sweetly by Marlene Aames and in an emotional scene when Homer tired of being stared at pushes his artificial limbs through a window for her friends to get a better look at. The eloquence of the fabulous Gladys George and Roman Bohnen living in shanty town although none the less proud of their coming home soldier Fred (Dana Andrews). Then theres Hoagy Carmichael who as Homer's uncle Butch feels the need to take special care of him under the circumstances. Dorothy Ames and Don Beddoe who give loving support to their daughter Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell) knowing that her marriage to amputee Homer could present problems. The handsome and surly Steve Cochran an ex-serviceman himself who is palsy with Fred's wife (Virginia Mayo). Michael Hall the son of Al Stephenson (Fredric March) who doesn't appreciate the Japanese war weapons his dad brings home for him. Ray Teal who demonstrates a negative view of what some others think about the war which angers Homer. Bank president Ray Collins who tolerates Al's indifference with his job at the bank. Dean White as Mr. Novak a farmer just out of the Navy and desperate for a loan without any collateral and also actor Howard Chamberlain the smug manager of the drug store where Fred applies for his job back. Along with all the others in the cast these players added the frosting on the cake and contributed in making \"The Best Year's of Our Lives\" a classic film.",

Anyone who has a heart will have a tugging at theirs for Russell's handless hero, and everyone must root for Andrews' character to divorce his trampy wife and get the girl he deserves.  War is hell, and this movie proves that homecomings can be just as treacherous.

Supporting and presenting the point of view of the society does not make people sad. By adding love stories, a good story emerges. The fact that he provides information about the American family life and tells it sweetly despite such a subject has made the movie a complete Hollywood classic. william wyler is a director who manages to explain romance very well. It markets emotional situations according to social and moral conditions and realizes its presentation extremely well. the greatest example is the roman holiday. The duration is too long according to the story, there are many scenes that cut the fluency and re-enter. this may bore some spectators. It is unnecessary to wander between the three characters and to give the same amount of space. It was one of the elements that attracted attention when watching the movie. There is no need for such sagging for films that add the return stories of people who have lived under bad conditions and instill happiness. Of course, if there is no creep in the subject. It can be called a classic. If you have reservations about the duration, it is useful to turn to other alternatives.",

I know that my prejudice is unreasonable and I risk missing some very good movies because of it but what can I do-I like quirky flicks, also ran's and B-movies the hell with the Miss America's I want the bearded lady in the side show. I was a bit disappointed I kinda liked this movie. I liked Myrna Loy and Dana Andrews, both great screen actors. I love Teresa Wright-she can do no wrong in my book. Fredric March was the weakest of the leads despite winning the Oscar for best actor (too much fat on this ham) but Virginia Mayo's performance holds up (and talk about va-voom! What a knock out. I wish they had gone with an actor for the role of the disabled vet. Harold Russell was admirable to tackle the part but his inexperience as a performer was off putting (think Sofia Coppola in \"The Godfather 3\"). Thank god we have William Wyler helming the picture-he is a great director and keeps this cumbersome vehicle humming along. Best scene: March's homecoming when Loy realizes it is her husband who has rang the doorbell. Almost wordlessly executed it is an exquisite piece of filmmaking. Too bad there are not enough of them to make this a great movie-only a pretty good one",

            "content": "Here's a few of the gender themes that I've found thus far: The Best Years of Our Lives1. The New Woman vs. The Fallen Woman(Peggy and Marie) Peggy comforts Fred when he is scared, cares for the sick, helps out in the war effort, and is kind and domestic. She, like Fred, wants a nice house in the suburbs.\nMarie doesn't want the house. She wants to be young, have fun, and she cheats on Fred. She also tries to make him go out to dinner and wants to spend her own money.Of course, Fred's cheating kiss is seen as excusable,because of her wicked behavior.2. Independent Women are lustful and sinful(Marie)Example: Marie has a career as a singer,which allows her to display her sexual side by seducing men with her siren's song. Fred wants her to give up her nightclub career.3. Domestic women must look respectable(Marie) Example:She doesn't \"look like a wife\" according to Fred's comrades. She's blond, made up, and sexy. She's what men want to f***-not to marry. Fred made a mistake by marrying a \"whore.\"4. Women must submit their household status to the returning male member(Millie & Al) Example:\"I'm the head of the household again,\" Al says. Too bad Al has been away so long that has no idea what is going on in the house. Plus, he's a still living through the war in his head. Wouldn't it be more logical to have Millie make more of the decisions for awhile?5. A woman must be a mother and a sexual being(Wilma and Homer's relationship) Example:After helping Homer remove his hooks, Wilma kisses him erotically. Homer admits that without his hands he is, \"As helpless as a baby.\"6. Infidelity is forgivable if your wife isn't ideal (Fred and Peggy)Even though Fred is married to Marie,he kisses domestic Peggy. The film makes this excuseable,since Marie is such a wanton woman.7. Women don't need intellectual connections/respect to fall in love-they just need a chance to nuture(Peggy and Fred)Fred hits on Peggy before he even goes home to see his wife. But Peggy calms Fred after his night terror. She's a new woman ,after all, and she is willing to act like a doormat to comfort the returning GI's. The two of them share a lunch and all of a sudden they're in love. Peggy has had one decent conversation with this fellow. She refers to him as broken and hints to her parents that she could fix him now that his wife has tossed him aside. These are just the gender themes. There are so many other fun things that can be pulled out of this movie(vets will adapt to home life, let's move to the suburbs, let's stand up for soldiers rights, what if there is another depression,etc,etc,etc).",

He is engaged to Wilma who he feels is better off without him due to the loss of his arms and his feeling that he will be a burden to her. The scene in the movie where he has her follow him into his room and remove his \"hooks\" as his artificial arms were referred to is a point where the audience is shown that Wilma truly loves Homer and assures him that she loves him and who he is and the loss of his hands is not an obstacle to their life together. The other character Fred comes home to a wife he had just met and married prior to going into the war. Their relationship shows the opposite of Homer and Wilma's love and care for each. The belief that a person's character is what is important instead of their physical appearance or ability. In Fred's relationship, that a person's wealth is not what matters but his character and values are also shown to the audience. Finally, we see that in Al's situation he places his faith in the character of the veteran to give a loan to despite the Bank's questioning the fact that the veteran has no collateral to secure the loan. We see in all the stories involving the characters in the movie that a person's wealth, physical ability or possessions is not what matters in life, a person's values, integrity, morals and character is what should define us and what people should place importance on.",

Adjusting to life at home isn't as easy as one would think as Homer has lost his hands, Fred goes from being a Captain to being relegated to being a soda jerk in a drug store, and Al goes back to his bank job where he has to turn down loans for fellow former soldiers. As they try to adjust to their new old lives they learn things may never be the same again.William Wyler was already a famous filmmaker before going into the military for World War II, having made films such as Wuthering Heights, Jezebel, and Dodsworth. Incorporating his own experiences as a combat filmographer into the film, Wyler made what is arguable his most successful film with The Best Years of Our Lives. After it's release it went on to win 7 Academy Awards beating out It's a Wonderful Life for Best Picture, and Harold Russell won not just one but two Academy Awards (one for Best Supporting Actor, and an honorary award \"For bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance\"), the only actor to ever win two Academy Awards for the same performance.The Best Years of Our Lives is a film that has a lot of pertinence in today's world with so many troops overseas making their way back, and it's still the best film on the subject. Wyler's attention to detail, choosing not to make things over lavish as most films in the 1940's did, and to give it more of a documentary flair help give the film more of a real world feel. And while the subject matter might seem like the film would be a darker affair, there are moments that would still make you genuinely laugh out loud, as well as other lighter more tender moments.The acting is superb from all involved. The two actors that truly stand out in my mind watching this are Harold Russell and Al Stevenson. Harold Russell, an actual physically disabled military man, shows great depth in his performance as Homer Parrish dealing with love and the notion that he needs to drive his girl away because she deserves better. Al Stevenson, also does a superb job as a former sergeant who feels guilty for having come home to find himself a good job while also dealing with family issues and his feelings toward having to away loans for former GI's who feel they deserve better.I highly recommend this movie, this is one of those rare perfect movies and to be honest, it deserved it's best picture nod over It's A Wonderful Life. Even with it's ranking on AFI's top 100 films at #37, these days this film is still criminally overlooked and underrated. If you like films dealing with WWII, great dramas, and superb acting, you should definitely give this film a shot.5/5",

I really like this movies plot and how it realistically shows the struggles that a lot of veterans face when they return home after being in the military for so long.

The unfortunate fact is that lots of veterans deal with the problems that are depicted in this movie and even though this movie was made back in 1946, it still has a message that can resonate with a lot of people today.

            "content": "Few films send a chill down my spine and even fewer I could watch over and over. The Trip to Bountiful with Geraldine Page is one; this is another. I'm more of the Vietnam era but this story from WWII is great in every way. It's very real; there is nothing hollywoodish about it. I am very familiar with the plight of returning GIs from Vietnam and even WWI and Korea but had no idea the vets of WWII faced some of the same apathetic receptions. I am a great fan of Fredric March and in this film he deserves the Oscar - but then so does Dana Andrews whose character breaks my heart every time I see him try to get a job worthy of someone who used to pilot bombers. This is an old film so I'll just say it -- to see him at that soda fountain just tears me up! And what can you say about Homer - the great Harold Russell? I'm getting all choked up just thinking about it. All the girls are super too including Fred's goldiggin wife but even her character can be understood though not necessarily liked. Like many reviewers of this film I think we could go on and on. This is a keeper. I even checked this one out of the library not long ago and when my roommates didn't seem interested I kicked them all out just so I could watch in peace! Great. Just great!",

            "content": "The post apocalyptic atmosphere of the untainted 40's and details that mention much about the spirit of a veteran make this movie one of the best I have ever seen. This movie reminds me of \"fear and loathing in Las Vegas\" in many ways, despite the differences. Patriots adapting, fear and loathing.This movie is about three men and the way they struggle to adapt their minds to the changes back home in America after being overseas, after the second world war. Traumatic but still strong with details that almost blew my head of.I love this movie despite the traces of some sort of \"straight\" propaganda that also is significant for that specific age and its spirit.",

(She doesn't even know how to scramble eggs - watch that scene again.)At least the Virginia Mayo gets a job and isn't willing to pamper an apparent loser.Little Peggy is going to find out what it's like to get stuck with an alcoholic with no money.",

There are so many unique moments - the montage of nightclubs with Al, Milly, Fred and Peggy.  Homer showing Wilma what it takes for him to get to bed every night and Peggy having the guts and love to watch and finally get it through his head that he is more than just his hands!  Great writing and great acting.  There will never be another to equal it.",

Samuel Goldwyn deserves credit for having the chutzpah to push through a film who has for its leads a disabled vet with pincers for hands, an alcoholic, and an underachiever.",
