            "content": "Hopes were not high coming into Spy Kids: All the Time in the World. It is the fourth film in a franchise suffering from diminishing returns, plus it was using the stupid idea of smell-o-vision. And this family film does not disappoint.Marissa Wilson (Jessica Alba) is a top OSS spy who retires after capturing a super villain, Tik Tok, and starts a family with her husband Wilbur (Joel McHale) and stepchildren Rebecca (Rowan Blanchard) and Cecil (Mason Cook). A year later a new villain has emerged, the Time Keeper, who speeds up time using the Armageddon Device to punish humanity for wasting time. Marissa is called back by the OSS director, Danger D'Amo (Jeremy Piven), to recapture Tik Tok which should lead them to the Time Keeper. But the Time Keeper sets out to kidnap Rebecca and Cecil because Rebecca has the only thing that could stop the Armageddon Device.There are many problems with Spy Kids: All the Time in the World. It's a cheap and unimaginative film where you could easily predict how they would play out. We have seen these story elements so many times before: the dad is a workaholic; there is animosity between step-mum and step-daughter as the step-mum tries to get closer to the children; the revelation of a lie, and so many others. The humour is crude, mostly poo, fart and vomit gags, basically the lowest common denominator which most children will easily outgrow. The other major route of humour is the barrage of puns: time puns, dog puns and smell puns \u2013 we're not stupid! The action is rudimentary; it is easy to expect much better from Robert Rodriguez who just uses poor CGI and quick cuts. And if you can't guess who the Time Keeper really is then you haven't seen enough movies. Spy Kids: All the Time in the World feels like it is a movie that is only made for a quick buck, not for any love of the material or the need to tell a good story.A movie aimed at children should be able to enliven their imaginations: Spy Kids: All the Time in the World is not going to do that. The artificial CGI scenes just look too fake for children to accept and buy into the action and the basic predictable plot will mean that children will not love it. Adults and parents will feel nothing but suffering when watching this movie. This is just a mindless movie with no imagination, which is ironic considering it makes a point that children make better spies because they have more imagination. Children are smart; they ask questions, see plot holes and come up with ideas involving sci-fi concepts. The best family and children's movies are clever, well-plotted affairs and often have good ideas behind them. Spy Kids: All the Time in the World does not share those traits. Plus this movie carries on the awful trend of spies with babies not working.Most of the acting is sub-par. The child leads are bland and not natural actors; it's your typical weak-child acting, and they are no Chloe Mortez or Kodi Smit-McPhee. McHale was truly unconvincing as the father and again a typical bad performance in a bad family movie. Alba was a punch bag for gags to be bounded off on. Ricky Gervais seemed to be having fun, but I'm sure that's because he got a paycheck for saying bad lines in a recording studio. Piven is much the same, having fun and just being over the top.As movie fans we expect better from Rodriguez, who's done great movies like Sin City, From Dusk to Dawn and the \"Mexico\" Trilogy. Let's hope he is doing this movie so we can finally get Sin City 2.And I am sure you are asking the big question \u2013 what was the Scratch-and-Sniff card like? It was just a bunch of sickly sweet smells and simply just a gimmick. But you already knew that.",

Joel Mchale (who i have actually become a fan of based off his THE SOUP and COMMUNITY work), Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara give some incredibly bad performances. Embarrassingly-so. Jessica Alba does what Jessica Alba does (thank the Gods she's cute and met Robert Rodriguez), and Jeremy Piven....actually i liked Piven. His character had an interesting story- arc, and he gives a solid performance.Some of Ricky Gervais' one-liners were funny, too.The rest of the film was pretty unbearable. However, speaking as a parent who was out hoping to show his kids a good time, i actually have to give this movie a solid rating. My 2 kids enjoyed the heck out of it, from the talking dog to the baby decking a bad guy, the kids loved it. And my son had a lot of fun keeping track of when to engage the AROMASCOPE scratch card. A nice film for younger families, i think.",

            "content": "I thoroughly enjoyed the first two Spy Kids films, they were fun, entertaining and ideal family films. Spy Kids 3 was rather mediocre and disappointing, but any horrible assets that film had was nothing compared to this.When I entered the theatre to watch this, yes I wanted to see it despite the trailer not looking that good, I thought if it is bad surely it can't be as bad as The Adventures of Sharkboy and LavaGirl. I was wrong, as awful as that film was Spy Kids 4 takes the cake as Rodriguez's worst film.The film for starters looks cheap. The camera work at best is odd, and the effects lack clarity. The gadgets looked cool from the outset but once the nappy bombs for instance are introduced they lose their appeal very quickly.I didn't think much of the soundtrack either. I found it rather generic here rather than jaunty and memorable. And Rodriguez's direction is his most unfocused and inept directing job in my opinion of his career.The script is awful, relying far too much on tired slapstick and heavy-handed messaging, while the story is rushed and much too thin for the film's running time and the action is dull and not helped by the haphazard editing.Acting-wise, this film is disappointing. It was nice to be Daryl Sabarra and Alexa Vega here but other than the basic concept of the movie, them and Rodriguez, there seemed to be no connection to its predecessors. The new kids do what they can, but they aren't as confident or as appealing.Jeremy Piven does give his all into a very underwritten and uninteresting villain part and his two other roles as well but at points it feels like he's overdoing it. Danny Trejo is wasted, Antonio Banderas was cut which is yet another reason why this doesn't feel like a Spy Kids movie, Jessica Alba does nothing with her role other than look pretty, while even Ricky Gervais is flat.The cast are not helped by how their characters are written. The characters here are so cardboard, it is difficult to engage with them on any level.Overall, despite the trailer I was all for seeing this film. But it was awful(as part of a franchise and on its own terms) and a big disappointment. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "I have often said that in order to enjoy mindless movies like \"Transformers\", we should \"leave our brains at the door of the cineplex\". Well, in order to enjoy this \"Spy Kids\" sequel, we need to lower our IQ to the level of four-year olds! 'Mindlessness' doesn't quite cut it, it is juvenile indulgence, meaning, it is only for kids below five.And if you have been following the cinema ads and promos, you would know that this movie comes in 4D - with the added dimension of 'smell'. For that, viewers are given a numbered card (called Aroma-Scope) so that they can scratch-and-smell when the number appears on the screen. This is a childish gimmick aimed at kids. For adults, it is more of a nuisance because the scents are faint and the exercise distracts us from the action on the screen. Although there are many fart and poop scenes, the Aroma-Scope only provides scents of chewing gum and other edible stuff (thank goodness for that). History has demonstrated that all smell-o-vision gimmicks mostly stink.Marissa Cortez Wilson (Jessica Alba) is such a dedicated spy that even when she is nine months pregnant, she manages to take down notorious villain Tick Tock (Jeremy Piven) before going into labor and retiring from her spy duties. Her aim is to devote all her time to her newborn and her step-kids, Rebecca (Rowan Blanchard) and Cecil (Mason Cook) and hubby Wilbur (Joey McHale).Soon, however, she may not have that much time. One year later, Tick Tock and accomplice, The Timekeeper (also Piven), are back at their attempt to rob the world of 'time' - and Rebecca, Cecil and their 'guard dog' Argonaut (voice of Ricky Gervais) must save the world (what else?). Also, they team up with Marissa's niece and nephew, Carmen and Juni Cortez (Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara reprising their former Spy Kids roles) to make this mission a family reunion of sorts.Writer-director Robert Rodriguez seems to be milking the same old cinema-script cow, urging parents to spend more time with their kids. This 'message' has been used by almost all family movies throughout the decade. The time-theft and time-travel conceits can be puzzling to children even if they allow Rodriguez to make use of all sorts of time-related gags. Of course, Rodriguez cannot resist the poop and fart gags, as well as throwing food all over the place. These, I understand, are the laugh-out-loud staple for American kids below five.Among the cast, Blanchard and Cook are suitably cute and effective as the new title characters. Bringing back former Spy Kids, Vega and Sabara, is a good idea, adding a nostalgic touch for parents in the audience. Ditto that for Danny Trejo's short cameo as Uncle Machete. However, the irony of Daddy Wilbur being a 'Spycatcher' on TV is lost on the kids and scores no points with the adults.As for Jessica Alba (as Marissa, the younger sister to Antonio Bandera's character), she provides the main box-office lure, nothing more. Strictly kids' stuff. (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)",

            "content": "Considering it's a sequel that sounded like it could be awful as there was none of the original cast attached the project, it's a really fun and consistently entertaining ride that is great for the whole family! 8 years after the previous Spy Kids, we follow new characters including Marissa Wilson (Jessica Alba) a retired spy who is called back in to stop a menacing new threat, The Timekeeper (Jeremy Piven). Along the way, her step-children discover the world of espionage and want a slice of the action! I'm pretty bemused at how badly this was received; I think it's a really fun and care-free kids film with cool gadgets and pretty sweet performances. The kids Rebecca and Cecil played by Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook fit the roles nicely even if the Cortez's are missed a bit. The Timekeeper also turns out to be the best villain in the series with a cheeky yet deep performance by Piven and a backstory that makes you sympathise for him; often the best villains are ones you can empathise with on some level. Let's not forget Ricky Gervais' vocal performance as the dog which is a must see for Gervais fans! There are also some nice appearances from characters in the original trilogy and that definately heightens this one to feel more like an authentic Spy Kids film. My only reservation is the 4D technique used; it's going to date the film very quickly and the prompts used at the start don't work as well when your at home rather than the cinema. Nevertheless if you have your doubts like I did, give it a go; you may be pleasantly surprised!",

            "content": "I'm aware that many people like to encounter films as a small, unchallenging adventure. That isn't possible with me, but I have something similar: sometimes a simple film is a relaxed encounter with the filmmaker, a sort of illustrated visit in his home.I like Rodriguez. I like his joy in image and his independent enthusiasm. I do not ever expect him to produce something that changes my life, like fellow Austinite Malick can. But sometimes you just want to hang out. One thing that is impressive is knowing that he creates his films mostly in his own studio with greenscreen, networked to special effects subcontractors. He must have had to do things that few others do in order for his work to seamlessly integrate with his life.So, though there is nothing profound about him except his passion, visiting a film can simply relax into that passion. I am particularly hooked on the Spy Kids franchise because the first one had so many inside references to old AI tools and techniques that I assume he worked very closely with someone from that era, perhaps even someone I know. Perhaps it was a side effect from setting up his personal production infrastructure.But it also because I know he is coming at this as a dad who enjoys his kids and basically wants to share at a cinematic level. That is why, for instance that I tolerate the over top 'dad message' about the importance of spending time with your kids now rather than be absent in a studio. (Yes, that is the basic plot.)The first film was themed on AI as mentioned. The second on genetics, and the third on a Tron-like game. This one plays \u2014 in the most superficial way \u2014 with speculations on parallel universes and time joins. Others will inform about the amazingly bad acting by both pairs of siblings, the really off- beat pacing and the general heavy-handed nature of the thing. But under all that is a genuine human, being genuine and open, inviting us into the world he decorated himself (there's a joke about that). Where else but with Rose's influence will you get a superspy kicking butt first as she goes into labor and later with the baby strapped on her chest. That alone will stick with you.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

            "content": "Like Jaws 4 and Superman IV: The Quest For Peace. Spy Kids 4 or \"Spy Kids: All The Time In The World\" is a Franchise killer. Although it was a moderate financial success against its $27 million budget. It is such a poor movie, it ended any interest in any future movies. Mason Cook (in his first movie) and Rowan Blanchard (in her 2nd) are not as annoying as most child actors and are certainly cute enough, but they lack the chemistry that Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabra had in the first three movies. So Jessica Alba is pretty much left to carry the movie on her own. She tries hard but the movie is missing some of the charm and magic that made the first movies so likable. It also misses the talents of Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino. I give it 4/10 1 for Alba, 1 for Vega. 1 for Sarba, and 1 for the kids I'm sure most kids will like it, mine certainly enjoyed it, just not as much as the original three.",

            "content": "The original \"Spy Kids\" movie was a cute little kids film which was actually enjoyable for adults as well. So, the studio did what they often do...take a good idea and beat it to death with sequel after sequel! As a result, his fourth installment managed something no other \"Spy Kids\" movie did...it managed to make IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List. In other words, it's among the 100 wide release films that are hated most by IMDB users.In order to try to keep interest in the franchise, later films added gimmicks to keep the kids interested. This one has several....it's in 3D, it has 'smell-o-vision' (theaters were equipped with machines that dispensed scents) and there's a talking robotic dog....all of which loudly scream out 'jumped the shark'.When the movie begins, you'll notice that barely anyone from the original movie is here. This makes sense, as the two children from the first one were no longer kids...as a decade has passed. Interesting, the fully grown kids from the original films DO show up later in this movie as their original characters. And, since the kids in the film are new, so are the parents. One is a TV host of a show called \"Spy Hunter\", the step-mom is an actual spy for OSS*.When a super-villain named the Time Keeper starts affecting the passage of time, the step-mom is called into action. Almost immediately after, minions of this baddie show up and try to abduct the kids...and they realize their step is a spy! How do the kids defeat this first wave of minions? By hurling puke bags at them...an excellent metaphor for this picture!So, was there anything I liked about this film? A few things. I appreciated how the boy in the film wore hearing aids. You rarely have deaf or hard of hearing characters in movies. The only sad part is that it didn't look as if they hired an actual hard of hearing kid for this part. The look of the film is also nice...they clearly spent money on the movie and came up with some cool gadgets. And, finally, I did appreciate that they brought back the grown up spy kids...a nice touch.What I disliked mostly was the scatological nature of much of the film. These were just gross and unnecessary...and guaranteed to offend and bring down the quality of the production. The film also lacks originality and it looks like there have just been a few too many trips to the well, so to speak. What was original, but unwanted, was the robot dog. While a few of his comments were kind of clever, mostly he was there to provide potty humor.The bottom line is that I definitely did NOT like this film but feel that kids may like it...parents certainly won't in most cases. The same things that turned me off might be enjoyed by some kids...especially the robotic dog. So, I'll give it a 1 for parents and a 5 for kids...and will split the difference for my overall score.*There really was an OSS. The Office of Strategic Services was created for WWII and later was renamed the CIA.Three times could be the charm...but what about four??",

It seems the movie thinks that watching these story lines is entertaining to kids, when in fact, it's not (speaking from my perspective as a 13 year old kid). To be frank, it's quite annoying.However, this movie doesn't lack on the entertainment value.

Now I was entertained by the first two Spy Kids movies, but the third one was rip off of Tron(1982).Jessica Alba is amusing in her role, as a retired spy, wanting to become stepmother to her husbands(Joel McHale The Soup)kids, and having one of her own. But then an old enemy comes back in the picture, and she is called back into action. But will her husbands kids become the new spy kids?The two original spy kids make an appearance, they are Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara, and you know they are not kids anymore. But that was a big problem for me, cause I feel the films focus went more on them, and less on the new spy kids, it was like the new generation was making an appearance in there own movie. Jessica Alba was good, so was Joel Mchale. But they where convincing as a couple, now Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino was more convincing. But all in all an amusing film, had interesting effects. But go in this movie knowing, what too expect.",

Basically Marissa Wilson (Jessica Alba) on the surface appears to be just an ordinary mother with a new baby and married to famous spy hunting television reporter Wilbur Wilson (Joel McHale). Her intelligent twin stepchildren Rebecca (Rowan Blanchard) and Cecil (The Lone Ranger's Mason Cook) don't want her around, thinking she is uncool, in fact, with her husband unaware, she is a retired secret agent. Her true identity is only revealed to Rebecca and Cecil when they enter the underground layer of the house, full of spy gadgets and gizmos, and they become entangled in a world domination plot, the maniacal Timekeeper (Jeremy Piven) threatens to take over the planet by slowing time. Marissa is wanted back in action by the Organization of Super Spies (OSS), home of the greatest spies and where the now defunct Spy Kids division was created. Rebecca and Cecil are surprised by the revelation of their \"boring\" stepmother, and with their bickering ways they must put their differences aside and work together to save the world, and they get help from former Spy Kids, now teenagers, brother and sister Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) and Carmen Cortez (Alexa PenaVega), and robotic talking dog Argonaut (voiced by Ricky Gervais). In the end, after defeating the Time Keeper and his identical henchmen, Danger D'Amo and Tick Tick (both also Piven), time is intact and restored, and the Spy Kids program is revived, with Rebecca and Cecil going on to become recruiters of new agents. Also starring Danny Trejo as Uncle Machete, Chuck Cureau as News Anchor and Jeepers Creepers' Jonathan Breck as Wilbur's Boss. The previous instalment was a complete mess, it crossed the line between expensive trash and cheap rubbish with its use of special effects, unfortunately things have not improved with this fourth instalment, the special effects are pointless when you combine with a predictable and stupid story, I perhaps tittered at the voice of Gervais and some spoof references, but the charm has disappeared and it feels like the kids themselves are responsible for putting it together, this is one the kids and the family should not even bother with, a crap fantasy action adventure.

I took my two boys aged 7 and 4 to watch this sorry excuse for a movie. The boys actually were fairly entertained, but I must say they are not exactly seasoned veterans of the movie watching experience.We saw it in 2D but also had the '4th D' experience. This amounted to a card they gave you that you scratch and sniff at certain points during the movie. It is a horrible gimmick that does not even work. I scratched as hard as I could and could only smell a faint flowery smell. That is only one minor flaw of the movie.The other flaws are as follow. The acting is horrendous. How they continue to let Jessica Alba act and even STAR in a movie is a decision that some Hollywood exec will eventually pay for with their job. Her lack of acting abilities were only surpassed by the rest of the cast. But it was not entirely their fault as the film's basic plot and script was about as thin as Kate Moss on a hunger strike.So what do you combine with horrible acting, a thin plot and countless moronic lines written by the worst screen writers they could dig up? Mindless violence that is not suitable for small children. This movie is supposed to be about spy kids I presumed, based on the title. Most of the scenes and actions were played out by adults and the plethora of punching and kicking scenes was immature and detrimental to young, easily influenced minds.This movie is disturbing for young children and is completely inappropriate for children of all ages. It also is so horribly acted and the screenplay so ill-conceived that adults are left wondering how in the world Hollywood can continue to put out such dribble and expect us to shell out our hard earned dollars on such mindless 'entertainment.'To sum it all up, avoid this movie at all costs. Even if your children have seen the other versions and beg you to see it be strong and suggest alternatives. Show Hollywood that you will not be swayed by their slick advertising and inept film-making.",

The first two films are definitely better but this is way better than the horrid third film. I guess I liked this film because it brought back so many memories from my childhood. That was true when Carmen and Juni appeared on screen. I know the acting was cheesy and there were plenty of potty humor, but I couldn't bring myself to hate this film.Robert Rodriguez's film is about an evil guy who is bent on making time go faster so a retired spy and her kids are recruited to turn time back to normal.As I mentioned earlier, the acting is kind of cheesy. Jessica Alba is pretty good and is quite nice on the eyes. The kids are decent even though they say some weird stuff. Ricky Gervais makes an awesome dog with his voice.Overall, this is a decent film but I can see why many people despised it. Despite my thumbs up, I think it's time for this franchise to hit the bucket as I can see some wear and tear. This film wasn't even asked for in the first place but it's a nice distraction for the kids. It doesn't have the great visuals as the earlier films, but it wont matter to the kids.

Jeremy Piven chews scenery in his role, and the less said about Ricky Gervais as a talking dog the better.This film was perhaps meant to start a new series, but it ended up being an odd final outing for the franchise.",

Ever since then, a sequel was made once a year probably so the lead kids wouldn't get older. They ended up making a sequel eight years later and it's even more pointless than you would imagine. This movie features a new stepmother who's a spy trying to stop a villain named Tick Tock (really dumb supervillain name) along with the Timekeeper. We get this tired clich\u00e9 that actually happens to both parents in different jobs, not having enough time for their kids. The worst thing about this movie is the crude humor.There's a robot dog that literally pees oil and poops bombs. Oh, and he can fart for no reason other than that it entertains him. Farting dogs didn't work in \"Space Buddies\", why did they think they would work here? There's even one scene where the boy character has to throw up in barf bags so he can throw his barf at the bad guys. This was released in something called 4-D, which apparently added smells or something when it was in theaters. The 3D looks horribly out of place and if 3-D is dead, 4-D was the nail in the coffin.The special effects are really bad and I read that this movie was mostly made because of something Robert Rodriguez had in his contract with Harvey Weinstein. We should have been to tell he was a huge scumbag for being responsible for this atrocity. These movies started out great, but declined in quality with every sequel all leading up to the worst one of them all. Seriously, the original only has a rating of 5.5 here? It's got a 93% on RottenTomatoes! Any film with a baby throwing food in her mother's cleavage can't be good. *",

Am I regretting that decision. \ufeff There are so many problems with this movie, that I could actually list them. \ufeff 1) Jessica Alba, she is still acting 2) The kids in the movie are extremely annoying 3) The acting is just... terrible. 4) In the beginning of the movie, Jessica Alba's character is on mission during pregnancy. This is a recurring joke in the movie, in which while she fights crime, she has her toddler in a baby holster. \ufeff The extremely slow paced film soon becomes an bother of the viewer,to the the point where I checked the clock, what felt like 50 minutes, was a mere 20. If a film goes that far down the cutting room floor, I am forced to give the film, a: \ufeffNegative 10.5 Ticket Stub out 10 Tickets. \ufeff A Note to Parents: if your kids ever misbehave, put this on, it Will scare them back into line.",

Which was okay, but I was just there for the 3-D. Now, we get newer characters, a newer 3D technology, and we get \"Spy Kids 4-D in Aroma-Scope\". You know, \"Aroma-Scope\" is where they give you this card, so when a number pops out during the movie, you scratch the number on the card, and you smell it. That's pretty much it. But there are so many disgusting things in this movie that you just don't want to smell. I'm glad I didn't see this movie in Aroma-Scope, cause I honestly didn't want to sit through that torture. The 3-D is okay, though! Anyways, Jessica Alba, who is incredibly hot, is a retired mom who now is the stepmother to two crazy kids, one who is this cool kid with a hearing aid, and always bugs into situations, and then you have this annoying little girl pulling out all these pranks, and you just want her to shut the hell up. Their dad, played by Joel McHale, is a television star who doesn't have the time in the world to spend time with them, that's because this stupid villain named the Time Keeper, portrayed by Jeremy Piven, is trying to change time itself, and such bull-crap. So, they meet up with the original Spy Kids, Carmen and Juni, played by Alexa Vega, who's so hot today as an adult, and Daryl Sabara, who wasn't as good as he was as a child. They gear up, and they try to stop the Time Keeper. Then, we have our movie! What? I was just sitting there, listening to the jokes and gags, and they're just not funny. But the only thing funny about this movie was the talking dog. Ricky Gervais plays the voice of the talking dog, and he says jokes that are funny. The rest is just nonsense. Also, when you put Jeremy Piven, Jessica Alba, and Joel McHale in a movie like this, and they were all dumb, you just start to wish that they got good paychecks for this mess. Besides, the movie throughout was just so weird. Director Robert Rodriguez really wanted to make a family film for everybody, but all he made was a family film for nobody at all. That's why Rodriguez should never take movie ideas from his kids. The 4-D Aroma-Scope was super annoying, the cast looked embarrassed to be a part of this mess, the directing was childish, two hot chicks, and a dog that's super funny. All of that lead to a surprisingly annoying family flick. \"Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D\", in my review, \"a lazy and childish excuse for cinematic technology\".",

Although not as good as the first two, which were superb, I rate it about the same as the third one. It may be hard for some to embrace the new cast, which happens every time a new James Bond is cast. I think everyone is just as likable as the originals.

This film was pretty much pitched straight at them, and worked very successfully - on that level I must judge it a critical success.Personally, as an adult male, Jessica Alba in tight leather is probably the high point of this movie, although I have to say that she is very ready to make herself the butt of sight gags. Apart from that it is mildly, but not greatly, entertaining (I find fart jokes funny, so that was a plus).Rodriguez has fun playing with 3D - the use in this film is far more gimmicky than in most of the other 3D movies over the last two or three years.To address one of the criticisms levelled at this movie: yes, the message is one that we have seen a hundred times in movies before.

OSS (I'm sorry, I've forgotten what it stands for) agent Marissa Cortez Wilson makes a deal with OSS chief Danger D'Amo: she can retire to raise a family after one last mission: capturing the villainous Tick Tock, who has stolen vital OSS information. A year later she's raising her baby daughter and trying to bond with her twin stepkids, Rebecca and Cecil, but Rebecca still resents her for trying to take the place of the twins' late mom. Meanwhile, Marissa's husband Wilbur is launching a new reality show that follows him as he tries to catch spies. Unbeknownst to Wilbur, his wife is a spy and has been called out of retirement to stop Tick Tock and his boss, the Timekeeper, from stopping time. As Marissa is dragged back into service, her niece Carmen recruits Rebecca and Cecil in an effort to revive the OSS's now-defunct Spy Kids Division.The performances range from solid to fantastic. Newcomers Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook play off each other well as the squabbling twin siblings. I hope they'll continue to do well in the future. As the kids are recruited, they learn that their dog Argonaut is actually an OSS-issue robot dog being used to supervise them. Ricky Gervais provides Argonaut's wisecracking voice, and you can tell he's having fun doing it. Joel McHale's specialty is playing the man who doesn't have all the answers but is positive he does. Wilbur Wilson is one such overly cocky character, and McHale throws himself into the role with his typical wacky aplomb. Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara return as original Spy Kids Carmen and Juni Cortez. Their roles are relatively small now, but Vega and Sabara retain the chemistry that makes them so believable as siblings. Jessica Alba proves she's more than just a pretty face, showing pathos and surprising comic timing as Marissa tries to save the world and patch up her relationship with Rebecca.Jeremy Piven gets his own paragraph because he probably has the hardest job in the movie, playing the triple roles of the Timekeeper, Tick Tock, and Danger D'Amo. While the Timekeeper is something of a stereotypical supervillain, Piven's other roles come with unique challenges. He completely transforms his face and voice as the grotesque henchman Tick Tock; in fact, I wouldn't have known it was him if I hadn't seen him on Leno and Kimmel; but his third role is the toughest. The Timekeeper turns out to be none other than Danger, who is desperately trying to reconnect with his late father after a time-travel experiment in his childhood separated them. His sorrow and regret seemed to run deeper than the D'Amos and their time-travel experiment to Piven and his own late father, a suspicion that was later confirmed in an online interview. Watching him long for what can never be was heartwrenching and made me wish I could step into the movie and try to comfort him-both Danger and Piven. Playing what is billed as a triple role but comes closer to 24 roles once henchmen, duplicates, time travel, and the elder D'Amo are factored in is fraught with physical and emotional challenges, all of which Piven handles superbly. He gives his multiple roles his all, and as a result he may have delivered one of the best underrated performances of the year.I would like to conclude by mentioning that Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D is already getting Razzie buzz-and that said Razzie buzz is largely undeserved. Go to this movie expecting nothing but a good time with a good message-you might be surprised at what you find. I was, and I can't wait for the Blu-ray so I can relive my amazing discoveries in the comfort of my own home.",

            "content": "Shorts in my opinion is the second worst film he ever made.Rodriguez's problem is that he makes his kids' movies for HIS kids only. They come up with a lot of ideas. Unfortunately they're not old enough to come up with good ideas.The film opens with a 9 month pregnant Jessica Alba who is about to give birth any minute. And she is doing a mission. Okay, I know this is just a movie but..... what kind of organization lets A 9 MONTH PREGNANT WOMAN GO ON A MISSION? She's doing all these crazy stunts and doesn't even have a miscarriage. For a family film, this is just offensive.What other sins does this movie have. Well, we have the typical \"girl doesn't get along with her step mother\" clich\u00e9, wooden acting from Jessica Alba, Joel playing the same a****** he always does, bad CGI, the villain sounding like a chipmunk and making bad time jokes, gross out humour (we have a scene where a boy throws 4 bags of vomit on an enemy ship and we see it splatter in it's disgusting yellow glory complete with the boy saying \"Never underestimate the power of puke.\" and the baby farts in EVERY single scene she's in) and we have Ricky Gervais doing the voice of a robot dog.Also, how stupid is Alba's character in this film? She takes her baby along for her mission, even though the bad guys are most likely to kill them if they're spotted. (How did this woman get to be an agent anyway if she is so thick?) The villain shows his past on a video. This takes place in the 30's. How was this possible. How did they get an HD camera? How did he do close ups and editing? Who was filming all of this? This shows you how lazy Rodriguez is.I doubt that there would be a Spy Kids 5.",

When I was little I was having fun with the Spy Kids sequels,Lost dreams and Game over 3D. But I watched them again and had a second opinion thinking that they were stupid. This sequel makes them look like the godfather. In the most recent Spy kids movie Jessica Alba is playing a spy who has character name that I really don't remember or care about,who has her last mission catches the bad guy has a baby. Year after that some time keeper villain or whatever the heck his name was,makes time go faster and wants to go back in time to spend more time with his father.Jessica Alba recruits her kids and they must take some diamond and stop the Armageddon device and the time keeper. What immediately ticked me off about this movie is all the marvel references like for example , there is a chase scene in the beginning where the kids are in some CGI spacecraft and there being chased by the time keepers henchmen and it looks like there on the green goblins glider. But wait the references don't stop there,they also have a fight sequence going on and one of the kids have some hammer hands and guess what he says \"it's hammer time\" and then he lifts one of his hands and lightning is surging through it. That's when I lost it. The movie of course even brings back the original spy kids,but here's a problem with that,they do the clich\u00e9 of he/she is dead but they come back for the finale of the film for fan service although I doubt this series has fans and with this movie they lost them. Spy Kids all the time in the world is one of those family movies that make me hate live action family movies while the sequels before this were bad this is the worst. I give Spy Kids:All the Time in the World a half out of five.",

            "content": "I honestly do not understand the hate/low ratings of this movie.I took my 11 year old daughter, saw it in 3D and had a BLAST!It was just a silly, fun film with lots of cool action scenes and a great message on how important it is to make the most of every minute, because you can never get time back.The trailer pretty much sums up the movie, so I felt we got what we expected.I am not going to spend too much time on the plot - the trailer and other comments have done that pretty well.The good:1) lots of action 2) I was never bored - and based on the previous comments I really expected to be looking at my watch (pun intended) but never did. 3) The message. I feel living in the 'now' is more important than ever before. 4) Special effects, while nothing to win any awards, were both functional and frequently interesting. 5) Having the original spy kids back (as adults) was a REAL treat, and - for me- the real highlight of the film. I kept thinking - why didn't they have Carmen as the mother and Juno as her brother that had to help fight the bad guys? They would have been SO much better!6) It was truly a FAMILY film! Not that many films I feel comfortable taking my child to, so that in itself was great.The okay to bad:1) The aroma card was really, well, strange. It COULD have added something. But the #'s flashed on the screen so fast, and it was so hard to see the # and scratch it off, that by the time I was finished on one # it was already time to do another! I couldn't smell ANY difference between the smells, though my daughter definitely could! But it really didn't add anything.2) The dog. 90% of the jokes from this creature were just unfunny. I think one - maybe - two jokes made me smirk.. That as about it.3) The kids were okay, but definitely didn't have the appeal of the original spy kids.4) The high-voice time keeper REALLY got to me, it was so annoying!5) Jessica Alba was just so-so. Would have preferred to see the original Carmen in this role.6) The 3D was 'eh.' There were a LOT of times it COULD have been used to great 'in your face' effect, but never was. While it did add 'some' depth to the film, I felt the movie would have been just as fine in 2D.6) The husband and Jeremy Pliven were also - okay. Nothing special.The ugly:1) Okay, I REALLY loved the message of the film. But did it have to be HAMMERED into our heads EVERY scene? I lost track of how many times I heard \"spend more time with you kids\" \"you can't get back time\" \"make every minute count\" etc. Subtlety this wasn't. I kept thinking that somehow this was an apology from the director to his kids for not being with them for some extended time. Have no insight into this, but it seemed that he felt he had to prove this point as hard as possible.2) The barf and poop jokes needed to go. Really.3) The time travel motif was WAY too confusing for kids - and even me! Unless you feel comfortable explaining the movie \"Primer\" to your child, be prepared for some MAJOR confusion. Time travel is difficult enough -they didn't have to make it even more complicated!All in all, we enjoyed this film and there were some really fun scenes.I actually liked this a little better than #2 (never saw #3).Normally, I would say 'good film, but wait for the DVD,\" but I do think seeing it on the big screen helps - even in 2D.7/10",

            "content": "Anyone who hates this movie as much as some of the previous reviewers do, has obviously forgotten what it's like to be a kid.The latest addition to the Spy Kids collection has at its core the values that all the previous movies had as well - it's all about kids becoming more mature, and about pulling together as a family. Sure, I could do without quite as many fart gags, but I never liked those when I was a kid, either. Featuring Jessica Alba as Marissa Cortez Wilson, and Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara returning once again as a grown up Carmen and Juni Cortez - the original Spy Kids - this movie has some great action sequences and special effects, and it all adds up to a great experience for kids of all ages - even kids who are all grown up.I loved all three previous Spy Kids films, and even primed myself by watching them again this past week. I took my 15 year old daughter to see this one for her birthday today, and she absolutely loved it, as did I. She hasn't seen all three of the other ones, so she didn't recognise any of the cool gadgets at the OSS' Spy Kids Division, but that didn't keep her from having a really good time. I hadn't watched a movie in 3D in probably 30 years - back when you had to wear those goofy green and red cardboard glasses, and if you didn't wear the glasses you couldn't make any sense of the picture - so watching this in the relatively new RealD 3D format was a real treat.Score: One point off for the modernized version of the failed \"SmelloVision.\" My daughter and I both decided to abandon the \"Aroma Scope\" cards after the first three scents really didn't smell like much of anything. But a bonus point at the same time because unlike SmelloVision, which blasted the smells right in your face, now you have the option of not using the scratch-and-sniff cards if you don't want to. So one point down, and one point up. But one point off for having just too many jokes and gags based on bodily functions. The movie would have been just fine without them. I give it an 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "I love the Spy Kids movies - even Spy Kids 3, despite its flaws.When they announced that Spy Kids 4 was on the way, I had mixed feelings. Yeah, it was cool to see another Spy Kids movie on the way and as the cast was locked into place, seeing Alexa Vega and Darryl Sabarra coming back was a total blast. Then it started to get a bit worrying with news of the gimmick of smell-o-vision being used to try and sell this one.The end result? A big mess. On the plus side, the effects and the 3D in this are better than they have been in previous outings. There is some fun to be had seeing Juny and Carmen come back as grown up Spy Kids and there are some nice little links to the original trilogy. The new Spy Kids are kinda fun but not as cool or engaging as the original two and Jessica Alba is pretty game to put up with some of the crap she's put through here. And some giggles can be had from Ricky Gervais' spy dog and Jeremy Piven's multiple appearances.That said, the smell-o-vision thing is just plain distracting (granted, it's not overdone and is largely confined to the starting 20 minutes) with the large numbers flashing on screen and beeping to make sure you actually do scratch and sniff. The comedy is far too heavy handed and relies more on poop and fart jokes than in previous outings and is aimed strictly at the lowest common denominator - talk about dumbing down! And the message is hammered home with all the finesse and subtlety of sledgehammer to the crotch. There are numerous times where the whole \"spend time with your kids/parents\" is said direct to camera and after about the third or fourth time, it gets preachy.It's a shame that Robert Rodriguez felt the need to restart the series with such a lame and heavy handed mess, given just how much fun the first three had to offer. And, on a personal note, I was gutted to see that Uncle Machete was relegated to a blink and you miss him cameo after being built up so well. Aah well, I'm guessing there are plans for another couple movies so there's a chance that it can redeem itself but I think that after this, it's gonna have to work hard!",

            "content": "After watching the first three movies in the Spy Kids franchise I was interested to see this movie. After seeing that people had rated it poorly as noted on the movie's Wikipedia page, I was ready for a movie that would not be that great.This movie does not focus on Carmen and Juni but rather the stepmother and father of Carmen's children. The concept of the Timekeeper is interesting as it is similar to the villain in the 1990s Inspector Gadget movie in that he wants to stop time.Positives:1. Villain is humanized in that you can emphasize with him and his goal (to spend more time with his father), although you don't realize his ultimate goal until the movie's last 20 minutes. This is similar to the other movies where the villain either turns against his invention (Spy Kids 1) but different from the villiain who wants to rule the world (Spy Kids 2), or wants revenge on the world for locking him in cyberspace (Spy Kids 3)\n2. The gadgets used by the two new Spy Kids have cool effects\n3. A good family movie I guess in that the mother and father are relatable, although the father is so clueless that he doesn't know he has been married to a spy for 2 years even though he is the \"spy hunter\" (a person who tracks spies) who is fired from his job later on in the movieNegatives:\n1. An annoying talking dog, making me think I am watching Family Guy. While the dog helps in the first half of the movie, by the second half he just sits around and does nothing. Why?\n2. Bad or non-existent jokes. This movie is supposed to be a comedy but isn't funny\n3. While the two new spy kids work together, they are more annoying than Juni and Carmen by a long shotThere is probably more but I think this movie does not have the spark of the previous ones. It probably shouldn't have been made at all. The action and excitement of the other movies is not here, even Spy Kids 3, and the OSS seems more incompetent than ever. Spy Kids 3 should have been the end of this franchise (as was originally planned), not this movie.",

Sure there can be some horrible movies but come on give me a break. Having over expected feelings over a movie seriously it's a movie. I did not expect anybody to have so much much time to put so much in depth thought into a movie sure some I could see that but not this. Some times semi cheap effects can still be cool and as long as it is not a complete waist at least watching once and not terribly slow drawn out and over corny with no action what so ever, Than no I think there are kids that could like this movie. To say none will is a very huge statement to make considering there is not factual way of knowing for certain all will not like it unless go to each and all and ask all that will watch the movie. Please be more educated and wise with what indicate and say before do and please respect that you have the right to freewill and freedom of choice but using it wisely and not spoiling it for others who could like movie. It is selfish and inconsiderate, I will say since you were speaking of kids being smart and educational aspects. What it is to truly be wise , smart and educated is to know the right time and place to say something and as well how to say something but not talking out of emotion and impulse but through a well thought out mind frame and with potential at the same time being considerate of others and knowing for a fact what say is legitimate and 100% the truth and nothing but the truth. Its kind of like the saying don't be a hypocrite and practice what you preach there for being what preach and that is all I am saying.

I did enjoy the fact they didn't make the boy so scared or pick noise or be a bit odd in the movie like they did with juni. the only thing i got a problem with there was no real story in it. and it was way to short. still a good movie to rent for the kids and as a parent its not a waste of time. you can enjoy some of it as well.whats better wasting time doing something not with your kids or spending time with your kids? even if you do not enjoy the movie do you think your kids enjoy shopping for clothes and groecy ??? spend time with your family.",

            "content": "This movie is a very interesting thing indeed. Most people have given it terrible reviews.... And I completely understand why. This film has a lot of bad going for it. But it somehow still works.In my opinion, a bad film is a film that can't decently handle it's plot and pacing. The Room serves as a good example of a really bad film. Production comes second, which is what everyone is criticizing, and within reason.I think understanding this film all comes down to one thing: the director. Rodriguez is a good director and knows what he is doing (he made Sin City after all). The plot and script, while not to my taste (and with too many puns), work. Everything is tied up, the plot is consistent, and the lessons are learned without feeling forced.What makes the film really weird (emphasis on the word weird and not bad) is the production. The effects are really bad (and cheap) and the acting is just... Weird (there's no other word to describe it). The script is also just weird. Sort of \"trippy\" in a way. I felt like maybe the script writers were on some hardcore drugs at some points. Obviously, though, that's not the case. Rodriguez was just having fun making an over the top kid's movie. He didn't take it seriously, and neither should the critics. I think the most important thing to find out is do kids like the movie. Because if they do, Rodriguez definitely achieved his goal and this film was a success. Unfortunately I have no idea since my younger cousins haven't actually seen it.Why did I watch the film then, you ask. Curiosity on how one of my childhood movie sagas would continue. And in all honesty, while I haven't seen the originals in over a decade, I remember them a lot better. But maybe my expectations were just lower back then and this is a decent follow up.Either way, I give this film a 6 on 10. While the film has a strong script (as far as weird kid's movies scripts go), which makes the film watchable and definitely entertaining if the subject matter tickles your fancy, just everything else about it is a turn off for anyone but a kid. I would not recommend it to adults or teenagers. If you happen to have Netflix and are running out of good kids movies to occupy your child's mind, this isn't a bad choice. Otherwise, do not go out of your way to get this movie.",

OK, it isn't the greatest kids' film of all time but it IS certainly worth more than that!I didn't have the benefit of 4D (or even 3D) at home and so I can only imagine how exciting it would have been on the big screen with all the latest technology thrown in. But I will happily watch it again with my grandkids - and I'll bet THEY will give it more than 3.4!From an adult point-of-view, I thought Ricky Gervais as Argonaut the dog was very funny - which, in itself was good because it just goes to show how funny he can be without needing to resort to profanity.I was very tempted to give Spy Kids a 10 out of 10 just to drag the average up a bit but then I figured one vote isn't going to make that much difference so I gave it what I really thought it was worth - a 6 (but then maybe I should have waited for my grandkids to tell me what they think it's worth).

The movie is well justified keeping in mind the target audience and assures to entertain kids as well as adults. Totally worth a watch",

            "content": "'SPY KIDS: ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD': One Star (Out of Five)Robert Rodriguez's fourth film in his popular kids' movie franchise in which he performs his usual writing and directing duties as well as several other functions including producing, cinematography and music. I'm a big fan of Rodriguez, he's actually one of my favorite writers and directors, but I hate his kids' movies; I love all of his films except the ones he aims at children. I admire him fully embracing his inner child, creativity and unchecked imagination but I just don't think it works with his kids' films. Sure they're entertaining and amusing to children but they offer them no other value and have absolutely nothing at all to offer adults (except a painstakingly annoying film going experience). A good kids' movie should be entertaining to adults as well as children and Rodriguez's films definitely don't have that quality. As far as the 'SPY KIDS' films go (as well as his other kids movies) this one is by far the worst as well. It was simply painful to watch and one of the most unpleasant film going experiences I've had all year!It's been eight years since the last 'SPY KIDS' film and stars (of the first three films) Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino are nowhere to be found in this installment. Jessica Alba stars this time around as retired spy Marissa Cortez Wilson. She's married to a TV 'spy hunter' reporter named Wilbur (Joel McHale of TV's 'THE SOUP' and 'COMMUNITY'), who has no idea she's an actual spy. The two have a newborn baby together but Wilbur's ten year old twins Rebecca (Rowan Blanchard) and Cecil (Mason Cook) don't appreciate their new stepmother. All that changes when Marissa is called back into action to stop the evil villain Timekeeper (Jeremy Piven) from taking over the world and the kids get involved in the action. The original 'Spy Kids' Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara), Marissa's niece and nephew, return to help the new 'Spy Kids' out. Ricky Gervais costars as the voice of the family dog and is the film's one saving grace! The movie completely scrapes the bottom of the barrel clean! There's not much lower Rodriguez could have gone in trying to appeal to the laziest part of children's minds. One could argue that movies like this make kid's dumber but I wouldn't go that far. If I had kids that wanted to watch this and just be entertained for 90 minutes I'd probably let them but I certainly wouldn't want to watch it with them (unless I hadn't already seen it I guess, because of the Rodriguez factor, but under no other circumstances). A good kids' film should be one you can enjoy watching with your children and get something out of as well (like 'THE MUPPETS' from earlier this year, or the 'STAR WARS' films). I really wish I could enjoy Rodriguez's kids' movie ventures as well but I just can't. It's too bad he doesn't put that amazing talent to better use; I know there's a truly great family film in him, he just doesn't know how to channel it yet.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioQaCI5Qk34",

Overall the acting was really good for such a young cast and the story line was different from the first 3 films but I believe the third spykids film (Game Over) was not a very good story line. This film is slightly dark at times but the quality of the film and the issues tackled within the story make it a fantastic watch.I think as a kids film it is pretty awesome and I loved watching it.

Eight times sniffing with some barely discernible smells makes sense, so to speak, if you're writer/director Robert Rodriguez trying to outdo the vibe of his El mariachi or even a previous Spy Kid movie. He needs antihistamine for clarity of purpose and unity of story.Jessica Alba is called back to service as a spy to stop the Time Keeper from taking the world's time so he can go back to his dad. Straight out of Bat Man's Joker. Oedipus this is not although the film would have done well to explore more fully the Freudian undercurrents. At best, Rodriquez sprinkles around a kid's vomit, a dog's flatulence, and a dirty diaper for laughs and for critics like me to discover hidden meanings (I'm still thinking). New spy-step kids help pregnant Marissa in the fight while feckless dad (Joel McHale), a TV spy catcher, is sidelined with identity issues that Sophocles and Freud would have appreciated. Even old spy kids return, but to no avail because the plot is a series of set pieces with some nifty graphics but no depth.The \"super rich sensory multidimensional experience\" promised by a talking dog in the beginning of the film doesn't quite jibe with what I heard a young boy in the men's room say to his friend: \"What a cheesy movie!\"That's as bald an indictment as I have heard about any film aimed at this 10 year old. Although the effects are not cheesy, the story line and characters are. Robert Rodriquez is not, at least when he's not cranking out his fourth Spy Kids.",

When I was watching this, I was thinking of the late Desmond Llewelyn, he was the actor who played Q the weapons officer in the early James Bond movies. I wondered what he would think of the \"gadgets\" used here. This is the only spy movie I have ever seen where vomit, dirty diapers, and dog flatulence are used as weapons. Oh my bad, I have to realize this is a kids movie and they have to be gross to pull in the youngsters. I had never seen any of the previous Spy Kids movies so have nothing to compare this to. I was just bored and had nothing to do and watching this film helped pass the time, what a great recommendation for it! Seriously, the one positive message in this film is that the two children learn to love their stepmom and respect her when they didn't at first. This movie deals with a villain tinkering with time, but there is a more important message about time in it. The message is how important time with your loved ones is. The dad in the movie realizes this. Maybe this is something parents can discuss with their children after they watch the movie together.",

Based on other reviews, this is supposed to be -- by far -- the worst in the series, and I hope those reports are right, because it is something of a stinker.I am still confused about Robert Rodriguez. He makes kids films, he makes gory films. He hangs out with Quentin Tarantino... he just seems to do it all. This may be a blotch on his record. But the point I was trying to make (poorly) is that I cannot really follow his train of thought on writing movies...Was anyone offended by the pregnant fight scene? I was not, but I can see other people getting upset. Did anyone else think there were far too many time puns? Did anyone else think it was far, far too coincidental that Joel McHale wanted to make a show about spy hunting? I mean, he has no history with spies and coincidentally has a spy wife.

We saw the best effects, animations and adventures of that time and we had to think outside the box to understand it.

He really loves films and that counts for him. Unfortunately the next installment (or should I say: reboot) of Spy Kids is a little bit disappointing. And that comes from a fan who loves the first trilogy.Spy Kids 4 is more a reboot than a sequel. We get new kids, but the story is the same as in part 1. Charming Jessica Alba is the stepmother of young Rebecca and Cecil but doesn't do a good job because her spy past gets in the way. Just when things turn out for the better Jessica gets called back into OSS duty when the criminal she once arrested has a plan to steal all the time in the world. The two kids discover that stepmum is a spy and of course they follow in her footsteps. A new generation of Spy Kids is born.The opening scene, in which a very pregnant Jessica Alba does her last mission and arrests the bad guy, is actually pretty hilarious. But then it all goes downhill. The two kids aren't as charming as the original kids and for the rest, well, we have all seen it before. Crazy gadgets, crazy special effects... The ending has something to do with timetravel and the one who can explain it to me deserves a medal.Luckily the movie has its moments. Jessica Alba looks pretty hot and proofs she can do both action and comedy. When the old Spy Kids enter the movie, some of the magic returns. Alexa Vega (Carmen Cortez) has grown into a pretty lady. Her nostalgic tour of the old Spy Kids department becomes a very strong scene. Too bad Daryl Sabara (the original Juni Cortez) is so different from his boy-self that we can hardly recognize him. In the end the message that it's important to support your family gets smacked in your voice too many times. Yes, we understand what you're saying. What's also bad, is that because the two new Spy Kids are much younger than the kids from part 2 and 3, the action and (slapstick) comedy is mainly meant for kids 6-9. That makes Spy Kids 4 a real kiddy movie. That's bad news for the parents.I really wished that this movie would be good, because I loved the humour in the first three Spy Kids movies. But even the 3D is bad and the Smell-O-Rama cards don't work. So I'm afraid this could well be the definitive end of the Spy Kids series.6/10",

Well, a few days ago I decided to rent it on my Playstation and watch it with my little brother. A few minutes later, I shut off the movie, deleted it, and convinced my brother to choose a different film. That was the first time I've reacted this way to a movie. What was wrong with it? Let us count the ways: 1.) WAY too many puns. I counted about three puns in the three minutes we got into the film.2.)The villain had an utterly pointless high voice, and acted too much like a children's villain (skipping, high-fiving frozen people? Really?) 3.) Probably the worst part of all (for parents, that is) is the amount of explicit material for a \"family\" film. Essentially, the first part of the film focuses on a pregnant woman who goes into labor in the middle of a fight. Then, right in the middle of confronting the villain, she gasps and says, \"My water just broke!\" That's the point where I shut off my film. Many parents will probably find this film to explicit for children.Granted, I only got a few minutes into the film.

It's lost any zip it may once have had.The plot make Inspector Gadget look like Dostoyevsky, and the kid actors (Rowan Blanchard as Rebecca Wilson and Mason Cook as her hearing-impaired younger brother Cecil) are either painfully inept, badly directed (by Rodriguez), or both. Jessica Alba plays their stepmother Marissa, a retired spy, and the script totally beats to death the idea that Rebecca has never accepted her and continues to resent her, despite Marissa's plaintive overtures. Really, when I say they beat this theme to death, it's almost as if that was the primary plot of the movie, instead of what I guess was intended as a fun-filled romp with gadgets, talking robot dogs, a mad scientist, and Beagle Boy henchthugs.Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara return as the now young-adult alumni spies from the previous movies. Corny dialog, preposterously cheap special effects, bright colors, blatantly badly choreographed fight scenes, and many other wink-wink-nudge-nudge, \"see how you're in on the joke\" corner cuts also make a return engagement, but it's as if everyone involved had been thru them a thousand times before, and the result is like overcooked celery: It just lies there, limp, soggy, and unappetizing.I write my reviews for adults, who should definitely, absolutely stay away from this turkey, but I can't imagine that kids of any age would find it interesting or exciting, either.The 3-D was a post-production conversion hatchet job, probably the worst I've ever seen, and if for some reason you feel compelled to see it despite the above warnings, for heaven's sake save your money and see it in 2-D instead.Oh, the 4th D in the title?

The kids who played the spy kids didn't even go on a mission until the last 20 minutes of the movie to experience being spies. The father was creepy showing an eye brow look to his son to look tough and his show was dumb. How dare filmmakers imitate a similar home to where The Cortezes lived in! Acting was poor. Same goes for the gadgets. What was ironic was the new spy kids looked much younger than the original spy kids, when they started being spies. I think this was just a movie to laugh at how poor of a job it was made.",

Jessica alba who has been criticized many time by he acting skills brought an entertaining well acted performance for an action comedy film. but i still miss the stronger women figure Carla gugino who played the mother in the other three spy kids film. kids will probably love this film. this film is for more of the younger spy kids fans than the others have been. teenagers and adults may like it, may not. it depends on your interest. but the comedy and action is much more kid like than the others. still a fun, action, comedy for the whole family. and a movie that you don't have to think a lot. i say see it.",

The plot made some sense (but had some major flaws) but the message was spelled out way too much and repeated over and over just in case we didn't get it.

Rodriguez and the Weinsteins makes visually inventive pictures and yet the film is a bewildering assault of cheesy CGI. The core problem may be the writing \u2013 the characters may just have nothing funny or interesting to say and Rodriguez may have tried to overcompensate by having the animators work overtime. The writers certainly display a high level of ambition. The plot conjectures about the nature of time and toys with the paradoxes inherit in traveling backward in time in between fart jokes and a shopworn stepmother plot.

From my view, I never once either laughed or even chuckled. The film is filled with disgusting jokes and awful gadgets. The story has came out broken down and a disaster. It does not have a proper continuation after the trilogy. The action in this movie is completely outdated and cringy. The logic in this movie makes absolutely no sense. The visuals look like it cannot be afforded to upgrade considering this is the lowest budget of the franchise. And the characters are completely unappealing and have little to nothing to put effort into. Do I really need to say something to anyone? Don't watch this movie. I'm not even sure if fans of the trilogy are gonna like this as much. Because this is one of the most soulless films I've seen in my life that doesn't want to continue its story. So please, stay away from this movie. I'm not afraid to admit, the franchise is better off to stop right here. In fact, it should've been a stand-alone film.

Me and my brother (18) and his friend (also 18) went to the cinema and decided on Spy Kids 4D most based on our previous liking original 3 movies and the fact that 4D could only be interesting in cinema, not video. And so I expected a decent and fun children's flick, with warm message and lot of fun action.So, I was ready to love this movie in a children's kind of way and to see the Spy Kids legacy was supposed to be fun. BUT, when I saw the movie, I was totally disappointed. It was awful. The real value of this pic is exactly that three stars that average ratings gave, but I gave it more due to my admiration for Rodriguez, Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara. And seeing them all grown up and looking so cool and attractive was the best part of the movie, although their characters didn't do squat this time. They were kinda just... there, even more than Banderas and Gugino were before. But it was nice seeing them anyway. Although, for Alexa and Daryl fans out there, if you really wanna see them now in something worthy, go see Halloween, Repo or Machete.I know that the story is supposed to be bubbly and childish, but I think that they were totally out of proportion with plot-holes and defying gravity and common sense, for anyone older than 7. And there are many children's movies who are still innocent and fun, but far more realistic anyway. I didn't expect much realism anyway, but 30% of realism couldn't harm even the most imaginative films in the world. The talking dog-robot, shiny colors, gadgets who look more like MacDonalds toys than anything else (I suppose their replicas are supposed to be in promotion), ALL IS OK by me. BUT, I draw the line at villains WHO NEVER PUNCH OR TRY PUNCHING ANYONE, not even adult characters! They just stand there and wait to get hit!! Also, performances were OK, adequate for this kind of film, no one's acting was above or below the OK level. Jeremy Piven was actually really fun as the main villain (Gosh, I 'spoiled' the 'unpredictable' plot twist!) and his image was kinda cool.And I usually like kids, and I'm ready to defend them any day, but the little girl was SO ANNOYING!!! If she was an adult she would be called a name starting on B, no doubt. And the way she treated Jessica! I never thought I would say that, but she needed to get hers, and not her brother instead, who was kinda cute.Effects were decent, but 4D was awful! At least in my cinema. NOTHING was going out. Numbers couldn't be scratched out, just on them, and all smells were kinda similar, mostly like peppermint.And yeah... 'Spy Detector'... right! But I guess it is OK if you are 7.",

At an innocuous hour and a half, the connect-the-dots simplicity of the plot goes down smoothly, while the oft-recited platitudes about family and time actually hold some water given that most of them are being recited\u2014 and learned by\u2014children.

But when I saw this, I was outraged about how stupid this was. Now, since Robert Rodriguez is done directing good movies, I wish this movie never happened. This just absolutely downgraded the whole Spy Kids franchise. I hated this movie. Oh, and the 4D was just annoying. One time, a kid farts and it tells you to smell it. What kind of a movie does that. Well, I don't see any new movies using it, and that was a smart move. If this movie was called anything else, I would of still thought it stunk, but putting the Spy Kids title on it just made it worse. Jessica Alba did the best she could, for her role was stupid and meaningless. Carmen and Juni were a big success. The other 2 know it all brats, one a child who is hearing impaired, and 2, a prank pulling, bad acting, brat daughter who defines the word selfish. Snow White and the Huntsman has better jokes than this (And Snow White has no jokes). The plot to this story was the typical plot. A step mother with two step kids, one who hates her and a Spy Hunter T.V. show star husband. But the step mother is actually a spy. When the two kids are attacked, they have to get in to action and fight against the time keeper. For some reason, Carmen and Juni are in this, but they are a lot older. This a stupid movie, and the only thing good about this movie was the talking dog voiced by comedian Ricky Gervais. I don't know how they got him for this $2,000 picture. At one part, where the bad actress who does the prank star step daughter is attacked by some giant claw, she tries to avoid it and turns her head to the side, avoiding the claw. If you look closely, you can see her smiling. This was a huge disappointment, and awful film. Absolutely terrible. D-.",

The dramatic music is held back ever so slightly and only once Alexa Vega returns do you feel more in tune with the Spy Kids world. Ricky Gervais as Argonaut keeps the humor going big time! Perhaps just for those who are British like me, I don't know what Americans think of him and most importantly, I don't care. The funny thing is Argonaut seems to act completely bored with the movie after a while, maybe the dog found it boring, but the movie kept me glued to the screen. There's nothing more annoying than the villain having a STUPID, high pitched American accent, I'm not sure what State this comes from but jeez Louise, it's so irritating. Did I miss a caption saying \"3 years later\" at the beginning of the movie? Or does that baby grow up really fast? Is she the only one affected by time speeding up? I'll have to check that out again. In one scene Alba basically uses her baby as a human shield - great. Alba, my goodness... There IS such a thing as babysitters.. but no, go ahead, endanger your babies life.. I'm sure you have your reasons :)At one point does Alba say \"Your really starting to tick me off\"? Well, that might be bad enough for a movie about time, clocks and what-not but the first time I watched it I thought she said to the -oh so squeaky villain- \"Your really starting to get me off\" Why.. err.. I didn't see the attraction but okay! :) Maybe she's into squeaky voices, who knows. How many times does a revolting stench have to pop up in the movie? So your meant to scratch the right number before someone in the movie farts in your face, there should be a warning. So glad I didn't see this in a 4D Cinema :DPretty average acting from the kids, but hey, they're just kids, they will get better in TIME. Zomg, I just had to. Sooo, the main villain we have is the Time Keeper, yes. He isn't an epic bad-ass like what Floop, Minion or the Toy Maker were. Though we don't see much of him in the first 45 minutes of the film, most likely due to the fact that his costume almost made me wet myself.. we wouldn't want that in the Cinema's would we? But hold the phone, we've already got the farting stench, we might as well have the stench of pee to go along with it.. moving on. (I've caught cheesy disease from this movie, excuse me.)I couldn't wait for Alexa Vega to get out of that uniform... you know she's 22 now? I know right, where did the time go. It was nothing to do with the Time Keeper if thats what your thinking. Eight years since Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over. I feel old. \"Ohh Shii-Take Mushrooms!\" Almost fell for it this time Alexa, almost. I liked that part, it brought back memories of kids trying that one at school after the first Spy Kids, though they still got detention anyway. Where I'm from and probably everywhere else in the English speaking world, saying $hit isn't such a bad thing.Cecil (the boy) seems a little heartless or at least emotionless when it comes to his mum being dead. Rebecca is torn up about her mum being gone but he really doesn't care. I thought he was just bottling up his feelings, as boys tend to do only to reveal how he feels at the end, but no, he couldn't care less. Hell yes, Ralph returns. Remember Ralph? He was awesome. I used to want a Ralph.. when I was small.. Remember Robosapien? He was my Ralph. Kids will love this movie, not sure about adults, but it's definitely a good family film.\"It's not about how much time you have, it's about what you choose to do with it.\" I felt something from this movie and the messages within it, probably just because I, like loads of other people, can relate to these things. I regret some of the time I've wasted. The movie tells the audience about the regret you will feel once you've lost the time that you should have made the most of. Sure, the movie wasn't the BEST movie ever but it was far from the worst. I've never seen a movie try to spread this message before, it's interesting. A definite eye opener.

It is at the OSS that Rebecca and Cecil meet OSS boss and former Spy Kid Carmen Cortez. In the meantime, Rebecca and Cecil's father, Wilbur works at Spy Hunters, a local television show about hunting and capturing spies. The only problem, though, is that he has yet to catch a single spy. That is until his spy compass points him towards multiple spies.This film stars Rowan Blanchard (Girl Meet World) as Rebecca Wilson, Mason Cook as Cecil Wilson, Joel McHale (Community) is Rebecca and Cecil's spy hunter and happy-go-lucky father, Wilbur Wilson, and Dark Angel's Jessica Alba as their stepmother Marissa Wilson, who also happens to be a spy. Jeremy Piven (Entourage) plays three roles in this movie: Danger D'Amo, Tick Tock and Time Keeper. Ricky Gervais voices Agronaught, their talking dog, who also happens to be a spy.The writing is pretty good and funny, as is the directing, and acting from the like likes of Alba, Blanchard, McHale, Cook and Piven. Altogether, they make the movie funny! Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara reprise their roles as Carmen and Juni Cortez, respectively, and Danny Trejo reprises his own role as Uncle Machete. Alexa's acting wasn't as good in the beginning as it has been in the past, but she can be forgiven as it had been eight years since Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over, the third instalment was released. It also improved over the course of the movie, as did Daryl's.You would think that the fourth Spy Kids movie would not be as good as the first three, but it's just as good. It is, perhaps, just as good as the first! Of course, there are some things that the parents will pick up on and cringe about, but not the children; these little details will go over the children's heads. The graphics and lighting, though, like with the first three movies, are great!One of the great things, though, is that it still maintains that strong core value, which is that even as we grow up, family is everything and we are stronger as a team rather than fighting against each other. Together, we can waver any storm!The premise is really good, like the first instalment, as are the writing, directing, casting, lighting, visual effects, audio, scoring and producing! The movie is enjoyable for the whole family, not just for the children, with funny moments and lots of action, as well as stretching the imagination, introducing families to a world beyond reality. In the world of Spy Kids anything is possible! Parents, who grew up with the Spy Kids franchise, all of which began nineteen years ago in 2001, will be able to share their favourite movies with their own children.When Alexa first appeared, I thought her acting was a bit wooden, but it has been at least eight years since Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over was released, and her acting got better (or I could overlook it) the further we got into the movie.There are two downsides to this movie, both of which will go over the children's heads:\n1. Jessica Alba's fake pregnancy belly was... well, it wasn't fitted correctly and was clearly a fake.\n2. It was produced by the Weinstein brothers, which includes Harvey Weinstein.Other than this, the movie was pretty good, fun for the whole family, and that is why I would give it a 6.5, but seeing as the rating system doesn't include fractions, I will give it a seven out of ten.",

This information tells us how big egomaniac he is. This is also the reason why all of the Spy Kids movies were bad. Even the world crisis could not stop Rodriguez; some people are broke and hungry, while he spends a lot of money for such junk, also called as a disaster. I was also at the premiere waiting in a big, long line of people with my 3 friends and all I learned from this movie was that Mason Cook and Rowan Blanchard (Cecil and Rebecca Wilson) are only ''wannabe'' superheroes or spies or whatever they should be. I also have to mention that one of my friends(I'm not gonna mention names) had to change his pants after the premiere, but not because he was scared or anything like that, it was because I threw up all over his pants, because the movie was so bad. The idea of ''Aroma-Scope cards'' was dumb such as the story. I give this movie a thumbs down and a rating 4 out of 10 (only because I fell sorry for the ''Spy Baby'' and that dog; they were fantastic).",

If throughout the movie, on the other hand, the sneakers had come on screen again and again, with Smith repeatedly saying how great they are, then it wouldn't have been a movie, but a commercial. That is what Spy Kids IV is. A huge 121-minute long commercial for \"family\".While Rodriguez's movies usually have a \"family\" message to them, in this case it's way over-the-top. The word \"family\" is endlessly repeated until it bogs the story and the mind down. Even worse, the plot itself seems to exist only as a means of allowing the \"family\" message to thrive. The fact the puns with \"time\" and \"clock\" are equally endless doesn't help one bit. I've simply no time for them.As for the characters, the only interesting one is the dog. But it's not nearly enough. If you're a big Spy Kids fan, you'll enjoy seeing Juni and Carmen all grown up. Again, it's too little. And to be honest, their presence doesn't help the plot at all. There's too many adult non-essential adult characters using up screen time. I've read other reviews and, trust me, this is not about grumpy adults who don't get it. Sure, some kids may like the movie. But that doesn't mean it's good. Just like adults like crappy movies that no younger person could enjoy, this is a movie that might be enjoyed by some kids, but that very, very few adults will be able to watch through until the end.To summarize, adults might consider spending time with their family instead of watching Spy Kids IV. Or, you know, simply just watch a different movie...",

            "content": "A couple children discover their step-mom was a spy and become unwitting targets of the super villians, Tick Tock and Timemaster.I've never seen any of the other Spy Kids films. I was in the generation where when the original trilogy came out (2001-2003) I was in high-school and the film was targeted at a much younger audience. However, I am a 3D aficionado so when Spy Kids 4-D came out I was very much aware of it but only got around to watching in on 3D bluray very recently. The film is extremely childish, its a kid film after all, but I actually didn't mind the premise of it and the child actors were surprisingly likable. The action scenes aren't anything to write home about but they were fun and it's very family friendly so long as you like fart and poo jokes. The cast was interesting and it had some great names in this like Jeremy Piven, Jessica Alba, Joel McHale and Ricky Gervais as a talking dog. They arnt exactly used to their fullest potential but as an adult, I appreciated the star power. Although the jokes are aimed at children and not overly funny to me, there is one or two which I genuinely laughed at such as Jessica Alba trying to look cool and bonnet slide across a car while pregnant and chasing a bad guy! And even though I have no nostalgic connection to the first 3 films, I appreciate the fact that they got the original child actors back (now both in their 20s at this time) to resume their characters. There is a little twist in the tail I didn't see coming in regards to the bad guys, the story wasn't as cut and dry as I had expected and I lobe it when a movie is unpredictable for good reasons. But the twist in the story also leads to one of the films biggest let downs - the kids play almost know role in the eventual ending, and argument can be made if the kids were never around the outcome of the story would of remained the same. Maybe I missed something though... but to me, the ending would of happened with or without them which is odd considering the film is named after them! The only other big let down is the overreliance on CGI backgrounds. They are not looking good or holding up that well after all these years... has a very fake look to it all and sometimes took me out of the film. The 3D was noticable and had a few gimmicky shots, but I don't feel it was as well utilized as it could of been. The smell-o-vision cards that came with the movie also didn't impress me. When the number flasher on screen that's the number your rub n sniff to help create the immersion of if you were actually there and could smell what they smelt but the numbers all ended up smelling the same anyway and I don't know if that's because the cards are old, spent too much time trapped in a bluray case together and tainted one another OR were they never that great to start with and all smelt the same anyway???Final Verdict: As a kids action film, I think it's more than adequate and children under 10 or 11 should really enjoy it. It's easy to understand (mostly), plenty of cheap laughs for young ones and it has likable, relatable characters. For us adults, it's not fantastic but then again it's not for us! But I have to say, Jessica Alba, in a full body leather suit is a winner any day of the week ...",

But I was very disappointed and upset that I wasted an hour and a half of my valuable time watching this! Let me explain.First of all, I think this movie was very predicable and frankly, cliche. For example, There was a father who was a workaholic and didn't have time for his children, CLICHE. And there was a step mother and of course she didn't get along with the daughter. CHICHE! But besides the cliche, The movie was very predictable and you knew what was going to happen the whole movie.Second of all, The movie seemed like it was low budget and the acting was not the best. I understand they are children but the acting could have been a little bit better. Other then that, the cgi was ABYSMAL I think anybody could make cgi better then that!In conclusion, I think this movie was not worth watching and if you do end up watching it you would have wasted your time.",

But sadly she did it :'( About 40 minutes into the movie and i was literally lost, there was no direction, no story line and really lame jokes. It couldn't get any worse, before that British-talking dog started talking, i was literally about to cry. The theatre was such a dead place, even the kids weren't laughing. Hell, me and my friend started playing Fruit Ninja, on our phones. I could feel that i am going dumb. I, to be honest, lost my sense of humour after watching it and this will always stay with me. I used to think about things in a different way, but sure as hell, not after watching this.

To have an amazing sequel of movies with the same characters over time such as harry potter and then saying for the last film, you know time for a change let's put in different characters, destroys the movies before. Spy kids 1, 2 & 3 were great movies for all kids, adults, and families to enjoy, but spy kids 4 was nothing, had poor comedy, not much of a story line, a spy mum, new characters, was a waste of time and money. The movie felt about 10 minutes long and not planned just put together. A talking dog.. well adleast he was British still didn't make the matters any worse. Despite juni and carmen being older now, if they still managed to be in it why not base it around them again and still have the ending with new kids spy kids unit.There were a few positives such as having the original characters appear also there were some great quotes towards the end about family, which stood out, but with the use of the actual film, the quotes weren't recognized for what they were.Hopefully if there is a spy kids 5, there is more effort put in, but it won't ever be the same now, especially knowing what happens, spy kids is officially done.Unfortunetely the movie was awful, and despite wanting to rate it more it was about a 1 out of 10, when compared to spy kids 1, 2 & 3.",

The acting is bad, the humour is bad, the plot is generic and the action sequences are so cheesy, they're embarassing to watch.

But wait the references don't stop there,they also have a fight sequence going on and one of the kids have some hammer hands and guess what he says \"it's hammer time\" and then he lifts one of his hands and lightning is surging through it.

            "content": "I have no clue why but this actually was a very decent movie, almost even a good movie! There are a lot of fun things here. The ongoing rivalry between the kids, the pregnant mother which shifts into the mother running around smashing spies with a kid hugging her front side in a carrier, the complexities of 2 kids getting to appreciate their stepmom, some decent humor, and most of all, the spy stuff. Spy kids always makes you feel like our world is filled with the coolest gadgets ever and this installment in the series pulled that off very well. There were even some very good life messages thrown in.\n\nMINIOR SPOILER ALERT: They do bring back the 2 kids from the original Spy Kids movies. I thought that was going to make it incredibly lame but they did it in a pretty reasonable way.\n\nNOTE: This film came out a few months before Hugo did. I guess there was some sort of bug going around the filmmaking world where clocks are just the coolest things ever. The intro for Game of Thrones which was also released in 2011 a few months before this film is also very reminiscent of clocks.\n\nOther random thoughts: the dog actually grew on me as the film progressed. That sort of character is hard to do right and most films absolutely blow it but this one did it right. The child acting was pretty decent as well. The film has superb pacing and the length is also perfect.\n\nON THE WHOLE: If you are into this general genre, this installment definitely satisfies. I was extremely upset with the 3rd Spy kids film (the one inside of the video game) so I am super happy to see the series back in business.\n\nDO YOU HAVE TO SEE THE OTHER MOVIES TO APPRECIATE THIS ONE? Not really. You should probably see the first one but as I said before, the 3rd one was extremely weak and you can skip right past that one and watch this one without experiencing any plot gaps between films.",

Anyway she has two step kids who are endangered so therefore, they hide in their mum's hideout and find out she's a spy and later they both become the new spy kids with a villain being some guy who steals all the time in the world so that he can go back home to his dad as a child which he knows is impossible but he somewhat won't listen. Carmen and Juni also return as adults now and of course there's that 4D Aroma-Scope inspired by the 1981 film Polyester. Over the years, Rodriguez has seemed to get better and better with his old tribues and creativity and this movie proves it all. Spy Kids 4D: All The Time In The World gets a 9/10.",

Just like the last film, nothing but a cash grab and failed one too because this movie didn't even make half as much money as the other Spy Kids films did. Even Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara reprising their original Spy Kids roles wasn't even satisfying at all because they became bland and they showed their abilities to not act very well anymore. I will give the film one star because I did think that Ricky Gervais as the dog was a little funny and he had fun voicing it. Now I get to say I am finally done watching this franchise, they were things to enjoy about the first two films, but as 3 and 4 were made the franchise really started to show its lack of new ideas and laziness and Robert Rodriguez ended his franchise with a dud.",

Other than a ripper horror movie, nothing excites me more than a quality kids flick. I was also a fan of Spy Kids 2 but the series ran out of puff with part 3. It wasn't very good... and now 6 years later Robert Rodriguz returns to the OSS (Office Of Strategic Services) with an all new adventure with a new kids. This movie is a fresh and welcome return to the quality of the original movie. The two new kids are great and Jessica Alba has a lot of fun as their Spy-Mum. The two kids from the original trilogy return as adult spies which continutes the cannon nicely. The juvenile laughs are littered throughout the movie with stupid and zany gadets galore, loads of toilet gags and a great cartoony villain played by Jeremy Piven. Most amusing was Ricky Gervais providing the voice of an animatronic spy-dog (in typical Gervais style). Rodriguz is a movie-making machine... he does it all... and I love that he balances adults movies with kids flicks (Desperado, Sin City, From Dust Till Dawn.... VS.... Spy Kids, Shorts and Shark Boy & Lava Girl)... and he practically makes them all on his own. Spy Kids 4 is great stuff. If you've got kids then check it out... and if you don't have kids then so what? See it anyway. My only dissapointment was that Machete's character (Danny Trejo) only appeared for a split second.

            "content": "The 4th Spy Kids installment came unexpectedly, and with moderate commercial success. The Cortez family from the previous movies has been pushed aside for a new cast of actors in a new spy family, the Cortez-Wilsons. The original kids Carmen and Juni do appear in this installment, but act as supporting characters for the new cast. Even their potential to trigger nostalgia for older Spy Kids fans, who watched the originals when they were young enough to enjoy them (like me), isn't enough to save the weak jokes and nonsensical plot here.\n\nThe storyline in Spy Kid 4 is disjointed and unoriginal, and ultimately, makes absolutely no sense. The screenwriters probably spent little time attempting to develop a somewhat cohesive plot to follow. The acting is wooden and stiff, as is the misplaced dialogue. The weak attempts at humor are depressing, and, at times, cringe-inducing.\n\nThe first two Spy Kids films were far from perfect, but at least the absurd ideas made for funny results and repeated viewings. When you're making ridiculous fantasy spy films for a young audience, you need to be creative and take some risks. Things like the Thumb-Thumbs, fantastical creatures on the Lost Island, and a four-headed David Shaloub made the original films entertaining.\n\nThe simple charm and connection between family members also made the originals work. How they interact, argue as families do, and ultimately band together to save the day was fun to see. But any hint of those feelings in this installment is lost by the lack of effort by all involved with 4. I tried, but failed, to find a single good thing in this movie. If you want a simple adventure spy movie for the whole family, maybe not the best one, but at something with a sense of fun and creativity, then stick with the first two Spy Kids, because this is just sad and unnecessary.\n\n1/5\n\n(review originally posted on release, but has since been edited and improved by author on April 11, 2017)",

Spy Kids 4 All the Time in the World is just wow it is the worst thing I have ever seen in my life, it should have just ended with Game Over. But what's bad about it? is it the fact that you have to keep a look out for a number on screen so you can scratch your scratch and sniff card which makes you feel really stupid? the fact that you wear 3D glasses to? It makes you look like a total Bafoon, I mean do you really need a scratch and sniff to feel like your actually there CAUSE WHEN I WALK AROUND THE STREET I DON'T NEED TO RUB A SCRATCH AND SNIFF TO SMELL A FLOWER I'M PASSING.It dosn't feel like a Spy Kids movie and one of the main reasons for me is because the main characters aren't Karmen and Juni, yes they appear in it older which is kind of cool but when I think Spy Kids I think of them, why? BECAUSE THEY'RE THE MAIN CHARACTERS IN THE OTHER MOVIE'S. Now had they always changed the actors maybe I wouldn't complain as much but I think the main reason is these new kids aren't memorable what so ever, I can't even remember there names to be honest.Then there's the CGI again, oh my goodness they over use CGI in this film so much, it's like Game Over all over again, except in Game Over it's kind of understandable because the creators want to make everything look like the characters are in a game, but with this film it's real life and the effects look cheap and stupid.There are some funny moments but these moments are very rare and I mean very very very very rare. I could talk about this forever but let me rap it up saying that this film is OK for kids 3-7 maybe but for fans of the Spy Kids series don't bother wasting your TIME on this rubbish film....

            "content": "Spy Kids: All the Time in the World is a remarkable film. And not because it's particularly any good. It's a remarkable film because it makes Spy Kids 3D: Game Over look like Citizen Kane. It makes the worst film in the Spy Kids series be the second worst film in the Spy Kids series. That's how completely awful All the Time in the World is.\n\nSo the very first scene has Jeremy Piven getting chased by a nine month pregnant Jessica Alba....NINE MONTHS. There is no possible way that a spy agency would ever allow a NINE MONTH PREGNANT WOMAN into the field to do a job. There's NO WAY. Ever heard of a little thing called MATERNITY LEAVE? Oh wait, it's a kids movie and she's doing a bit that's funny to kids, right... But just because it's a kids movie does not mean that the humor has to be stupid. In fact kids should be offended by how dumb the humor is. That opening scene alone is entirely indicative of how utterly offensive this movie is.\n\nThe gaps in common sense and logic are abundant to the point of absurdity. The people in this movie are so stupid, it's any wonder they all haven't died already from sheer unconscionable stupidity. And while we're on the subject of death, the new Spy Kids are without a doubt some of the most obnoxious children I've ever seen in a movie (the girl especially). I kept hoping that they'd both horribly die at some point, but alas that was just wishful thinking on my part. I kept hoping and praying that they'd suffer and die from some horribly gruesome and sadistic series of Saw-like traps. Too bad that never happened...but a guy can dream can't he?\n\nNot only are they supremely obnoxious and irritating as characters, but they're also some of the worst child actors I've ever seen. Should I cut them some slack? Not at all. Just because they're kids does not excuse them from being atrocious actors. Want good child actors? See Natalie Portman in Leon: The Professional, Saoirse Ronan in Atonement or Chloe Grace Moretz in  500 Days of Summer or Kick-Ass. Even the original Spy Kids Daryl Sabara and Alexa Vega were better in their first movie than these kids.\n\nSadly, the adult actors don't really fare that much better. Jessica Alba still looks great as always, even when delivering some of worst lines of dialogue this side of the stratosphere. It makes me die on the inside to see Joel McHale in this movie. JEFF WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS MOVIE? YOU ARE JEFF WINGER FROM COMMUNITY! YOU BELONG AT GREENDALE. YOU ARE WITTY SARCASTIC JEFF, NOT AWKWARD AND UNFUNNY DAD WILBUR WILSON. GET THAT. Jeremy Piven I liked you so much better when you were Ari Gold in Entourage. And Ricky Gervais as the attack dog? No...just...no...\n\nNow I'll admit that I liked that Robert Rodriguez brought back the original Spy Kids for the film, if only to remind me of how much better the first and to a lesser extent the second and third films are to this utter abysmal abomination of a fourth movie. Those were the days...\n\nAnd I'm sure I'd be remisced if I neglected to mention some of the completely revolting puns and lines of dialogue in this movie regarding time. Thing is I love puns. Just not ones that small children who don't know what's good for them can understand. Puns like \"Clocked you\", \"Time's up\" or \"This time we better stop the Time Keeper from stopping time..\" Really? Really? There's a special rung in Hell reserved just for bad movies like this. Thanks for ruining my childhood...\n\nBut the biggest offense this movie has to offer is the very fact that it's another film in a long line of garbage that has kept Robert Rodriguez from making the one movie that he actually does need to make which will most certainly save his career: Sin City 2.",

But in reality, trying to mother Rebecca and Cecil, who clearly don\u2019t want her around, is her toughest challenge yet.  Also, her husband, Wilbur, wouldn\u2019t know a spy if he lived with one which is exactly the case - Marissa\u2019s a retired secret agent. Marissa\u2019s world is turned upside down when the maniacal Timekeeper threatens to take over the planet and she\u2019s called back into action by the head of OSS, home of the greatest spies and where the now-defunct Spy Kids division was created.

With a little help from a couple of very familiar Spy Kids, Carmen and Juni Cortez, and some mind-blowing gadgets, they just may be able to save the world and possibly bring their family together while they\u2019re at it.(The Weinstein Company)\r \u2026 Expand"
