            "content": "I like comedy when it is funny. I have to admit though, apart from Punch Drunk Love, Reign Over Me, Spanglish, The Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates and Happy Gilmore I have never liked Adam Sandler. I often find his acting style irritating, his characters unlikeable and apart from five or six exceptions his films poorly written with not much point to them.As much as I didn't think much of Little Nicky, You Don't Mess With the Zohan, Funny People and I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry(generally Anger Management, The Longest Yard, Click and The Waterboy I had mixed feelings on) neither of them are as painful to watch as this one. The trailer was enough to make me wish the ground had swallowed me up, and the film managed to be every bit as bad.So why did I see Jack and Jill in the first place if I didn't like Sandler? One reason really. Al Pacino. I consider this man a great actor, and this is not just The Godfather, Dog Day Afternoon, Scent of a Woman and Carlito's Way as I consider his performance in Godfather Part II one of the all-time great male performances.When I saw the movie on Tinyurl, having an inkling it would be bad but Pacino would be at least decent, in my opinion this is as awful as I was hearing. This is not just Adam Sandler's worst film, but also one of the worst of the year and one of the worst I've seen recently.Jack and Jill is a cheap-looking movie, with not much attention to slick editing or continuity and the lighting also manages to be dull. Of Sandler's movies, Jack and Jill is perhaps the worst-directed, because the director throughout seemed to be rushing through it. The soundtrack at best is forgettable, and doesn't seem dynamic with what's going on on screen.The acting is awful. Adam Sandler is a big part of the film's problem. None of his characters are likable, instead they are very annoying and Sandler's performance is samey and irritating throughout. Not only that, Jill is introduced too quickly with a severe lack of build-ups, and Sandler as a woman in all honesty is not pretty, sorry I had to say.I was hoping that Al Pacino would elevate just a little bit, as he was the only redeeming quality of Gigli, another example of a bad film. Alas, he spends the entire movie looking bored, almost as if what am I doing here, and the performance reads very much of him playing himself. The cameos don't engage either, they are not funny, in fact pretty much nobody seems to have a sense of comic timing, and just come and go. Nicky Swardson fares best, surprising seeing as I don't regard him very highly either.Worse are the script, characters and story. In regards to the script and the humour, Jack and Jill fails utterly. The dialogue is atrocious, very immature and hackneyed, while the physical and visual humour just left a bad taste in the mouth. I get that it was meant to be funny and not to be exactly subtle, but the poop jokes for example got really embarrassing and left me more disgusted than amused.Story-wise, Jack and Jill lacks any kind of structure, it all feels very broken and rushed. As for the characters, they are either annoying, shallow or both, I finished the film not only not caring for them but also forgetting them.All in all, Sandler's worst movie and one of the worst(I think only Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star, a movie I saw out of curiosity with little else to do, was worse) of a very hit-and-miss year. 0/10 Bethany Cox",

            "review_title": "Sandler's House of Stupid",
            "content": "Is it me, or are Adam Sandler movies getting stupider with each passing one? Oh sure, Sandler's sense of humor has been pretty dumb from the beginning, sometimes in an enjoyable way. But lately, his movies seem to be reaching for a lower form of humor than I even knew existed. I'm guessing it won't take long until we get a movie comprised of nothing but Sandler sitting on the toilet and belching for 90 minutes straight.But, I'm here to talk about Jack and Jill, a stupefyingly dumb comedy that places Sandler in a dual role as both an uptight ad executive and family man, as well as his loud, obnoxious sister. The movie was a miscalculation from the start. Seeing Sandler dressed in drag and talking in a whiny voice probably would have been pushing it in a three minute sketch back in his Saturday Night Live days. In a 90 minute movie, the performance is excruciating. Was there no one around to stop him and tell him the performance, and the character in general, was just a bad idea? No one to say that it just wasn't funny? Seeing a movie like this makes you want to sit Sandler down, and make him watch his performances in Punch Drunk Love, Spanglish, Funny People, and Reign Over Me to remind him that he is so much better than this.The plot (such as it is) concerns Jill (the sister) coming to visit her brother Jack and his family for Thanksgiving. She's only supposed to be there for a few days, but she extends her vacation time, and winds up staying almost to New Years. During that time, we get a lot of toilet humor (much more than a PG-rated comedy aimed at kids needs), a ton of product placements (How much did Dunkin' Donuts pay to get their brand worked into the plot of the movie? And would it have been better for business if they had just stayed out of the movie all together?), and a lot of celebrity cameos that include Sandler's friends, as well as some big names cashing a paycheck. The cameos in this film include David Spade (in drag, no less), Dana Carvey, Johnny Depp, Regis Philbin, John McEnroe, Shaquille O'Neal, Drew Carey, Christie Brinkley, and Bruce Jenner. Oh, and then there's Al Pacino.Yes, I said Al Pacino. Only he's not making a cameo, he's a main supporting character. He plays a caricature of himself as a raving oddball who speaks gibberish in order to fool people he can speak other languages, and becomes inexplicably attracted to Jill when he happens to meet her at a basketball game. Jill has no interest in Pacino, but Jack's ad agency wants to hire the actor for a Dunkin' Donut campaign, so he tries to bring the two together. When Jill further resists, Jack is forced to dress up as his sister and be seduced by Pacino. But never mind. The important thing is Pacino gets the film's only laughs, because he tackles the material head-on and with full passion. He obviously knows this material is stupid, but he gives such an energetic performance, you sometimes find yourself laughing, even if what he says isn't that funny. Say what you will about his decision to appear in this movie, but he earns every cent of that paycheck when he appears in trash like this.Outside of Pacino's off the wall performance, I can't say I laughed very much at Jack and Jill. The movie's just not that funny. Don't tell that to the guy who was sitting two rows behind me at my screening, though. Every tired pratfall, every loud fart that blasted on the soundtrack, and every knock to the head caused him to erupt in extremely loud fits of laughter, stomping of feet, and slapping his knees. I wanted to ask him what he found so funny about the movie. Most of all, I wanted to be enjoying myself as much as he was. That's obviously the intention of the movie. It wants to make us laugh and forget our problems for 90 minutes or so. That's admirable. But it fails on both counts. My guess as to the reaction of the man sitting behind me? He's been locked away somewhere for a very long time, and has never seen a movie in his life.I won't go so far as to say that Jack and Jill is the worst comedy of the year, as there's much worse out there. But, it's certainly one of the most annoying. This is the kind of movie where the filmmakers started with the idea of Sandler playing brother and sister, and then stopped there, not developing the screenplay, characters, or the jokes. Considering that the initial idea wasn't that hot to start with, maybe they shouldn't have even gone as far as they did.",

            "content": "Jack is a highly successful director of television commercials. For Thanksgiving his outlandish twin sister Jill (Sandler, again) comes to visit. Despite efforts to get her to leave, matters get complicated when Jill catches the eye of famed actor Al Pacino, whom Jack needs to convince to star in a commercial\u0085 I guess. What Jack and Jill is really all about is Sandler's effort to exact revenge against moviegoers.Drag is not a good look for Sandler, and it should be no surprise that he is unfunny as a woman. The jokes featured in Jack and Jill have the range of an infant golfer. Committing to a viewing of Jack and Jill is almost a misogynist effort. All manners of humiliation beset Jill. She takes damage to the head, gets groped, has her skirt looked up, and if the sound is telling she may even have her bowels destroyed. Pure class, that Adam Sandler.So not only is Jack and Jill an offensive PG comedy, it's structurally broken. Jill appears on the scene way too fast, in under five minutes. No build up to her arrival, no clever use of music from The Cars \u2014from what I can gather Sandler's favorite band\u2014for her reveal. Jill also has a tendency to run off into the woods, which at first is random. Lastly for what is billed as a holiday movie, Chanukah is glossed over through a montage and I'm not even sure how Thanksgiving lasted as long as a dinner scene.It's obvious that Pacino has no business being in this film, but what's really at stake are the remains of Sandler's reputation. If Sandler ever wonders why he can't get an Oscar nomination, all he has to do is look back at the selfish decisions he has made. Jack and Jill is not a script, or even a concept, that deserves a read. It's like a fake movie found within Funny People that was replaced with the more imaginative \"Merman\". Yet, Sandler turned it into a movie that will surely pay him upfront over $20 million. The awesome mess that is Jack and Jill is so wrought with issues that this reviewer can only stand to offer some bullet points for the lesser offenders. Katie Holmes is in this movie. David Spade is a better woman than Sandler. Jack has an adopted son whose entire bit is taping found objects onto his body. The character of Al Pacino has a line that inadvertently summarizes Jack and Jill. After watching his cheesy song and dance number in a Dunkin' Donuts commercial, Pacino turns to Jack and says, \"This needs to be burned.\"",

            "content": "The standard that Adam Sandler movies has set is pretty low, but even with such low expectations going to the movie, the movie still felt terrible. The gag is twins and ignoring that healthy identical twins with different genders is impossible, we get to see Adam Sandler dress up as a woman. And, we get to see Adam Sandler dress up as a woman a lot, ridiculously lot and so much so, that Jack Adam Sandler and the rest of the cast are just supporting actors to the almighty squawking of Jill Adam Sandler.We could say this is just Adam Sandler up to his usual antics but Jill Adam Sandler hogs up the screen time and nothing about her really makes any sort of logical sense. There is Al Pacino as himself who falls for Jill, a possibility that the writers explain away as madness or nervous breakdown of Al Pacino. Then, there is Jill who is loved by the kids and Jack's wife Erin (played by Katie Holmes) for reasons that Jill doesn't portray on screen and we are never shown, all we are shown is the mean and manipulative Jill. The Jill that Adam Sandler portrays is his own immature rendition of a woman, filled with toilet humor and displays of uncharacteristic skills and strength as positive attributes. Jill is portrayed uninteresting and vacuous though written differently, and that being the center of the movie makes the movie uninteresting and tiresome.The movie would have been an acceptable Sandler movie if Jill had been played by a woman who could actually portray a big heart. The previous Sandler movies were enjoyable movies, but Jack and Jill is a real stinker, barely watchable. The only thing I found interesting was the background opulence of everyone around, thrown around so casually that it really feels like the big guys involved in the movie have severely lost touch with their audience and given way to sloth where they think anything they do is magical. Avoid the movie.",

            "content": "I will start by saying that I have enjoyed many Adam Sandler movies and have found him to be a generally funny guy when I've seen him interviewed and when he was on Saturday Night Live.I laughed gleefully through Anger Management, Mr. Deeds, Billy Madison, 50 First Dates, and Happy Gilmore. Funny People and Just Go With It were awesome movies! I was brought to tears in Sandler's emotional portrayal in Reign Over Me.I have great respect for the man as a comedian and actor. But Jack and Jill is abysmal. The \"jokes\" are not only bizarrely misplaced - THEY ARE NOT FUNNY. I did not hear a single laugh, not even a slight giggle from any audience member in the theater. In fact, almost 1/3 of them walked out before it was over. Those who stayed, openly derided the flick as we all exited the theater in utter disgust and sadness.I don't know why Al Pacino was in this movie, his acting made it seem like he was forced at gun point to do this movie. Nick Swardson and Tim Meadows are way too funny to be in such a disaster. Especially given Swardson's stellar performance in Just Go With It.This movie is not a flop, its not an \"oops\", its not a mistake - it's a career ending pile of trash. A career ender that started with Sandler's god awful \"Grown Ups\" and climaxes with this revolting hunk of garbage.Sorry Adam, it's over.",

            "content": "What in god's name has made the great Al Pacino THIS desperate? Now, no one on this planet would ever go into an Adam Sandler film expecting something brilliant, but generally, at worst, his films are stupidly entertaining. However, his latest film, \"Jack and Jill\" is so astoundingly horrible, I am not even sure how to articulate how truly bad it is in a way I will capture the remorse one will feel for having spent money to see it.I went to the premiere, so all it cost me was (a thankfully short) ninety-three minutes.This time around, Adam Sandler plays a commercial producer whose twin sister, also played by Sandler, comes to visit and...and... You know, I am not even going to waste time describing the plot of this film as it's not ever important enough to bother mention, but it involves cameos by all sorts of (evidently desperate) people from Sandler's impressive rolodex...including Al Pacino.Yep, Sandler's rolodex is the only impressive thing to note about this film.If you have seen the trailer, you have seen any and all even remotely noteworthy moments from this otherwise act of tedium. It is not funny, it is not clever, it is not even so bad, it's tolerable. Every single thing about this film is beyond grating.Seriously. Up until now, the year's worst film was \"Red Riding Hood.\" This film makes that one seem like an artistic stroke of genius. I was uncomfortable just watching it as I wondered what every single why every single person on screen did in their lives to agree to be a part of this...train wreck. Hell, even a train wreck deserves curiosity.AND on top of all this, it stars KATIE HOLMES. That alone bears noting that if you are dumb enough to still see this film, make sure you have nothing lethal within arm's reach.",

Really?The jokes were pointless and not funny. I'm really tired of 'fart' jokes. Been there, done that. Not funny. The only funny part of the film was Jack's son, he had a couple of funny lines.

            "content": "How exactly does Adam Sandler's mind work? Has he deluded himself into believing his ideas are actually funny? I'm forced to ask these questions given the disastrous results of most of his recent creative projects. These would include \"The House Bunny,\" \"Grown Ups,\" \"Just Go with It,\" \"Zookeeper,\" \"Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,\" and now \"Jack and Jill,\" in which Sandler is not only the co-writer and co-producer but also does double duty as the title characters, who are fraternal twins. Imagine the work that must go into making this; Sandler had to be put into makeup for the female role, do all scenes with that character, then do all of the scenes with the male character, and then both versions of himself had to be digitally composited into the shots. In both instances, he had to react to a person who wasn't actually there.But what does all this effort count for in something this unendurably bad? If you can visualize the experience of listening to fingernails on a chalkboard, that's pretty much what watching this movie is like. It's a grating, strained, hopelessly unfunny comedy. It's being geared towards families, and yet every scene shows no indication that it was geared for any potential audience \u2013 with the possible exception of die-hard Sandler fans, who are truly devoted if they think seeing this will be worth the time and money. Its basically sound premise is ruined by the decision to have Sandler play both lead roles; as a woman, he could not be less convincing even if he had a neon sign over his head rhythmically blinking, \"I'm really a man!\" His proportions are all wrong. He looks grotesque.The Jill character is shrill, offensive, and annoying. This is exactly why Jack, a successfully Los Angeles commercial producer, dreads having her visit every year for Thanksgiving. She typically stays for just one weekend, which Jack has learned to grin and bear. But this year is different; since their mother died, Jill has no family left in the Bronx, and she now wants to stay with her brother and his family all the way through Hanukah, perhaps even through New Years. Jack is, of course, vehemently opposed to this idea. The same cannot be said of his wife, a perpetual go-between named Erin (Katie Holmes), and their children, Gary and Sofia (Rohan Chand and Elodie Tougne). They like Jill so much, you can't help but wonder if all three of them are either in denial or insane. Perhaps it's a little bit of both. Take Gary, the adopted Indian boy; he has a strange compulsion to tape things to his body, including salt shakers, cooked lobsters, and living birds.In a jaw-dropping subplot, Jack seeks out Al Pacino in the hope that he will endorse a new line of Dunkin' Donuts coffee products. Yes, he finds the Oscar-winning actor, who plays a caricature of himself, but that isn't the joke; Pacino falls head-over-heels in love with Jill, and spends the rest of the film trying to woo her. All eventually leads to him performing a rap solo and dance number. Let me reiterate that this movie features Al Pacino. You know, the \"Godfather\" trilogy? \"Dog Day Afternoon\"? \"Scarface\"? \"Scent of a Woman\"? \"Serpico\"? \"...And Justice for All\"? \"Author, Author\"? The astounding reality that he accepted the offer to be in this movie is second only to the considerable work he puts into his role. My God, he actually took this seriously.Apart from Pacino, we're treated to a host of other cameo appearances. Some are understandable, like Dana Carvey, Norm MacDonald, The Sham-Wow Guy, and David Spade (who, incidentally, also appears in drag). Others are just as unbelievable as Pacino. These would include Regis Philbin, Shaquille O'Neal, and Drew Carrey. Topping the list is Johnny Depp. Yes, Johnny Depp appears in this movie, too. At this point, he no longer has to be ashamed by his years on \"21 Jump Street.\" Even though his screen time adds up to less than two minutes, this will be a hard one to live down.The film is bookended by testimonials given by real life identical twins, who bounce biting remarks off each other before professing their love for one another. Did the filmmakers conveniently forget that the main characters are not identical twins, but fraternal, since one is male and the other is female? Never mind. It's more than amazing to me that movies like \"Jack and Jill\" get made. It's actually kind of disturbing. Movies like this are comedic dead zones that play to the lowest common denominator in a desperate attempt for laughs. In the course of this movie, Jill will do all manner of broad slapstick routines, including crushing a horse, getting into a barroom brawl with a rival woman (played by a man), and repeatedly whack an elderly Mexican woman (again, played by a man) in the head. And yes, she will inevitably go to the bathroom with the runs, and we will have to listen as the sounds of explosive diarrhea fill the theater.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",

            "content": "Inevitably, most popular comedians at some point in their careers cross-dress for a laugh. Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy, Tyler Perry, and Martin Lawrence have donned women's apparel and kept audiences in stitches with their audacious antics. \"Little Nicky\" star Adam Sandler has finally followed their footsteps, but his antics in a dress, wig, hose, and heels are nothing but a drag. In his latest and lackluster comedy, \"Big Daddy\" director Dennis Dugan's \"Jack and Jill,\" Sandler plays identical Jewish brother and sister Jack Sadelstein and Jill Sadelstein. Jack is a married, well-to-do advertising executive who produces television commercials, while Jill is his passive-aggressive spinster sister who still lives alone in the Bronx. She embarks on her annual Thanksgiving visit to Los Angeles, and Jack counts the hours down to her departure. Predictably, before his obnoxious sister leaves, Jill turns Jack's life head-over-heels. Sadly, Dugan and Emmy nominated scribe Steve Koren, with Sandler contributing, have contrived the least offensive but also the least hilarious Sandler comedy. This lowest-common-denominator farce boasts the usual bowel humor. The adolescent counterparts of our hero and heroine blow bubbles in the bathtub. No, those bubbles have nothing to do with soapy Mr. Bubble. So skeletal is the plot in \"Jack and Jill\" that this farce yields few laughs.You might even say Sandler is suffering from a humor tumor. Indeed, the best things about \"Jack and Jill\" have nothing to do with Sandler's cross-dressing exploits. The funniest parts are the pre-credit and post-credit scenes of actual twins talking about themselves. These scenes are nothing short of brilliant. Vaguely, this recalls a similar story strategy in the Rob Reiner movie \"When Harry Met Sally.\" Aside from these scenes which have no narrative linkage to the plot, the only other notable thing about \"Jack and Jill\" is Al Pacino. Clearly, Pacino must have wanted to get his funny bone on because he has a field day not only playing himself as a cantankerous actor but also stealing the show from Sandler. As usual, all of Sandler's \"Saturday Night Live\" collaborators--David Spade and Nick Swardson--as well as friends turn up in bit parts, even \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" superstar Johnny Depp puts in a cameo. Unfortunately, \"Jack and Jill\" never conjures up the frantic hilarity of earlier Sandler sagas such as \"Big Daddy,\" \"Happy Gilmore,\" and \"The Waterboy.\" The predicament Jack contends with in \"Jack and Jill\" isn't so much his sister's annual visit but his most prosperous client's outrageous demand. Dunkin' Donuts has singled out a specific celebrity for their next commercial. Nothing about the product placement in \"Jack and Jill\" is remotely subtle. The company wants \"Godfather\" actor Al Pacino to pitch their latest coffee flavor, the 'Dunkaccino.' If you aren't rolling your eyes up in agony at this plot, \"Jack and Jill\" may be your kind of movie. If he cannot land Pacino, Jack stands to lose the Dunkin' account. No sooner has Jill arrived than Pacino sets out to court her. He spots her at a Lakers' basketball game that Johnny Depp attends. He sends her a hot dog with his name and number on it. Initially, Jill isn't too sure about Pacino, but they date. Most of the humor in \"Jack and Jill\" is the mild, amusing stuff that might have alienated audiences back in the 1950s. Remember, this is a kiddie friendly PG-rated Sandler epic so nothing really obnoxious happens and the happily-ever-after ending is nothing short of schmaltzy. Meantime, Dugan and company throw in a subplot about a lovable Hispanic gardener (Mexican comic Eugenio Derbez) who is always kidding everybody, including Jill. He has his eyes on Jill, too. An infatuated Pacino doesn't throw in the towel easily. The biggest surprise is when Jack decides to masquerade as Jill to land Pacino. This is about the time that our hero realizes that his heart is in his wallet and he changes course.Al Pacino skewers himself with glee. During a Broadway performance of Shakespeare, Pacino hears a cell phone ringing and suffers a meltdown. Later, during another performance, he discovers that the cell phone ringing is his own! While he is dating Jill, Pacino talks about an opportunity to play Don Quixote. The pay-off scene has Pacino dressed as Quixote tilting with a ceiling fan. Pacino is genuinely funny because he isn't trying to be funny. The same cannot be said for Sandler. His farcical female impersonation act falls flat. He plays Jill as if he were in an amateur talent act. It doesn't help matters that both twins are rather colorless as characters. Meanwhile, Pacino isn't the only celebrity in sight. Indeed, John McEnroe, David Spade, Shaquille O'Neal, Drew Carey, Christie Brinkley, Michael Irvin, Regis Philbin, Dana Carvey, and even \"Subway Sandwich\" pitchman Jared Fogle participate in this pabulum. None of these stars can salvage this silly, shallow, second-rate slapstick that relies on hopeless stereotypes and obvious pratfalls. The ending with Pacino and Jack watching the \"Godfather\" Dunkin' commercial is the best thing about \"Jack and Jill.\" After Pacino watches the commercial, he tells Jack that nobody can see it. Pacino might well have been talking about \"Jack and Jill.\" Altogether, \"Jack and Jill\" yields few laughs.",

To elaborate The character Jill should have been played by a female actress for one thing. I realized that was part of the gag that Adam Sandler played both parts so they would be identical but really it just makes the movie worse. Sandler's interpretation of a female voice is so bad and annoying it makes you want to punch him in the face to shut him up. This is one of those rare movies where I actually wanted to get up and leave the theater. And I haven't seen a movie like that for a while.",

            "content": "It seems that Adam Sandler thinks he is Ben Stiller, having enough money and ego to put any kind of crap on film and call it a movie. And somewhere there is a thinking that dressing over-the-top in drag is funny. Jack Sadelstein(Sandler)is a successful advertising man that is trying to wrangle Al Pacino into doing a Dunkin Donuts commercial. It would seem that a lot of this movie's budget came from the over-kill of placement and mention of products. The mild mannered Jack is about to have his world turned upside down when his twin sister Jill(Sandler)arrives for the Thanksgiving holiday. Jack and Jill of course are as different as night and day personality wise; but the physical resemblance can't be ignored. The girl from the Bronx just doesn't feel happy in sunny California, so Jack's attractive wife(Katie Holmes)recommends dating. The landscaper Felipe(Eugenio Derbez)finds chemistry with Jill. But somehow Jill ends up being used as bait to lure actor Al Pacino into doing Jack's commercial. Hard to believe, Pacino actually wants Jill...and wants her to the point of obsession. This movie is full of crude humor that doesn't seem to come across funny. Joke after joke falling flat. Then there is a scene of almost a minute of flatulence...over-the-top adolescent; but garnering the most laughter in the whole movie. Well recognized stars scattered throughout the cast: Tim Meadows, Norm MacDonald, David Spade, Dana Carvey, Regis Philbin, John McEnroe, Shaq O'Neil, Michael Irvin, Christie Brinkley and Johnny Depp. Pacino is a total hoot barely beating Holmes as the movies bright spot.

            "content": "Before I get to the review, I want to talk a bit about twins. While the film is about fraternal twins (all boy/girl twins are fraternal), so many of the jokes are about identical twins and how they think and act and look alike. Fraternal twins are no more genetically similar than any brother and sister....so a lot of the act alike, think alike, feel alike jokes in the film are wrong and the only way this COULD work was if either Jack or Jill underwent sexual reassigment surgery and both were born the same gender. So, for this film, it SHOULD have been about twin boys...identical ones.Adam Sandler plays both Jack and his fraternal twin, Jill. Jill comes for a visit and is about as welcome and pleasant as Ebola. To say she is incredibly annoying is right on the mark! And, not surprisingly, Jack is annoyed by her and can't wait until this visit is complete. The audience feels pretty much the same about Jill! All the scatological jokes involving this character didn't help any!\nSo does this film work? Good grief, no! The film is currently #38 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List...and the film has set a record for most Razzie awards. This is because Adam Sandler was able to do something unprecidented...he won for Worst Actor AND Worst Actress!! In addition, it took home Razzies for Worst Picture and took home a total of 9 of these trophies!I think the reason it got so many Razzies and is rated so low is due to two things. First, the annoyance factor...Jill is so annoying and easy to hate that it's really hard to watch the film. Second, in recent years, Sandler has been in career freefall due to some very bad choices and it's become fashionable to hate his films. But is it among the worst movies I've ever seen? Not even close. An Ed Wood, Al Adamson or Willaim Grefe film would be much worse. But in the case of these filmmakers, they spent almost nothing to make a crap film...and Columbia spent a staggering $79,000,000 to make this crap! That's enough money to make an entire list of bad films!! So, while I hardly think it's among the worst films I've seen, it is, dollar for dollar, the worst...and it's a film that is completely brainless and annoying from start to finish.By the way, a couple things saddened me about this film. I find it hard to believe that Al Pacino would appear in such an awful mess and playing a man who is infatuated with Jill AND I was annoyed to hear one of my favorite songs in the movie. I now don't know if I can ever hear \"Don't Bring Me Down\" by ELO again without thinking of this godawful film. I could, however, easily believe that David Spade, Vince Offer and Shaquille O'Neal were in this film...they were right in their element.",

            "content": "Hello, I am Bloop the robot, and today I will be reviewing Adam Sandler's latest raping of comedy called \"Jack & Jill.\" Made by Happy Madison productions, which would be much more accurate if called . . .Un-happy Madison productions.So the movie starts off with lots of video clips of twins. Twins making fun of one another. Then we are introduced to Adam Sandler and Adam Sandler playing a woman who looks nothing like Adam Sandler, but looks more like Adam Sandler in drag.The Adam Sandler in drag was referred to as Jill in the movie, and the Adam Sandler playing a man was named Jack. Just like the children's books. Isn't that funny? But Jack and Jill never go up the hill to fetch a pale of water. Therefore it is an inaccurate portrayal of Jack and Jill.Instead, the movie goes downhill from this point. Much like the careers of everyone involved in this movie. Including Al Pacino, but I will get to that later. That was a teaser.So Jill comes to visit Jack for Thanksgiving. But Jack is very angry because he doesn't like Jill, and neither does the audience.Even though Jill is only supposed to visit for 4 days, she overstays her welcome much like the movie overstays its welcome after the first minute. It is terrible.Then, one day Jack goes into the office and he is told he has to make a commercial for Dunkin Donuts. And he has to cast Al Pacino. And the commercial is specifically about Dunk-a-cinos, which rhymes with Al Pacino's last name. Very funny.Because Jill admits to not knowing how to use technology, like robots, Jack creates a human dating Website profile for his horribly disgusting and strangely manly sister. Logically, because she is undesirable in every way, she is not contacted by a single man. But then Jack comes and feels bad and creates a profile on Craigslist in which he is misleading because he calls Jill a hot, crazy, masseuse with knock out looks because she knocked herself out with the wheel on the Price Is Right, but not the old Price is Right hosted by Bob Barker who was in Happy Gilmore, but the Price is Right hosted by Drew Carey, but not the fat and funny Drew Carey because this is the insanely skinny and sickly Drew Carey.So then a lot of guys contact Jill because they think she is hot and based off of this fake description, even though it is linked back to her dating profile featuring a real picture of her eating some kind of sandwich. And through a careful human female selection process, she chooses to go on a date with a guy named Funbucket, who is neither Fun, nor a bucket.Then Jill comes home crying from her date with Funbucket, and Jack is guilt tripped into feeling bad for her, and realizes that she has feelings. Stupid worthless human feelings. At this point, Jack's boss tells him to go to a Laker's Game because Al Pacino will be there. How did he know that? It is a comedy so that is irrelevant.At the Laker's human basketball game, Al Pacino sits next to Johnny Depp who apparently was bored that day and Adam Sandler said, \"Hey Johnny Depp, are you doing anything? And if not, please be in my stupid movie.\" Then Jack talked to Al Pacino, but Al Pacino likes Jill instead, even though we've already established that Adam Sandler is playing both of the main characters. Very funny.This is where the complex romance comes into the picture, where Al Pacino stalks Jill, but Jill does not like Al Pacino eve though he is rich . . . and Al Pacino. She is stupid. Just like this movie.Sadly, I am only 30 minutes into this movie, so I will summarize the movie in short sentences: Overt racism of Jews, Mexicans, Black People, and 10 year old Indian children.Jokes about poop, farts, diarrhea, and eating bad Mexican food.Cameo appearances by Norm MacDonald, Dana Carvey, Shaquille O'Neil, and the Shamwow guy.We definitely weren't \"\"Wowed,\" but this movie definitely was a sham. That is a pun.In conclusion, \"Jack and Jill\" is not a comedy but rather a tragedy. It was not even funny and did not have enough robots. It was terrible.*This review is taken from the YouTube Channel called RantingRobots*",

            "content": "In Jack And Jill, a successful advertising executive (Played by Adam Sandler) is annoyed because his obnoxious twin sister (Also played by Adam Sandler) is coming to stay for the holidays and a lot of trouble happens when she arrives. In terms of plot, that's pretty much it. This film did something very striking at the Golden Raspberry Awards. Despite 2011 being a truly awful year for movies, none of those other stinkers got anything. This film won every single award and it really deserves it. Clearly having learned nothing from Grown Ups, Adam Sandler plays the twins giving: The Worst performance I have Ever seen from Any actor in Any movie Ever and produces and co-writes Jack And Jill, a disturbing, excruciatingly unfunny, stratospherically inept and utterly horrifying comedy catastrophe that's more painful to watch than funny. The fact that this was even made and that anyone involved still finds work makes me question my faith in humanity. I'm not even going to talk about the positives since there are absolutely none.This is one of those thankfully rare films which has nothing going for it whatsoever. There are no funny moments. I don't mean that I chuckled once or twice, I mean there isn't one solitary funny moment. The acting, especially from the inexplicably popular Adam Sandler playing a boring, unlikable guy and a Bella Swan/Jar Jar Binks hybrid, is abysmal. The direction is rushed and unimaginative. The script uses every single dire joke in the fire joke book and is not only horrifically unfunny and to be perfectly honest, deeply boring since nothing much happens but it's also mean spirited and depressing. What's most outrageous of all is that they actually dare to drag Al Pacino into it. He plays himself and falls in love with Jill. It's worse than it sounds. There are no genuine defenses. There are no rays of sunshine. There are no positives. This is not a comedy. As for one achievement, it is impressive that everyone involved went ahead without realizing that they were making a surreal, harrowing, hideous cinematic nightmare which would make David Lynch green with envy and thinking what they were making was actually a comedy. And it has the worst trailer ever too.0/10",

Basically \"identitcal\" twins Jack and Jill Sadelstein grew up together as children, but as time went by it was clear that Jack was the more gifted and Jill trying to gain attention in the wrong ways, and now grown up, they hardly see each other. Jack (Razzie winning Adam Sandler) has become successful advertising executive in Los Angeles, married to beautiful Erin (Razzie nominated Katie Holmes) with two children, Sofia (Elodie Tougne) and Gary Sadelstein (Rohan Chand), and they are spending Thanksgiving together, and twin sister Jill (Razzie winning \u2013 for actress \u2013 Sandler) is visiting. Jill is needy and a passive-aggressive personality, and her irritating habits and overall presence is turning a normally calm Jack's world upside down, and she cannot help but ruin things for most people around her, because her rude comments and loud speaking. She has a list of things she wants to do before she goes back home, including an appearance on a game show, so she goes on The Price is Right, she also goes horse riding and goes on a studio tour, and as her plane ticket is open-ended she can stay as long as she wants, so she decides she will return at the end of Hanukkah. Jack is in charge with helping his client get a big name for a Dunkin' Donuts advertisement, and he is hoping to get actor Al Pacino (winning a Razzie, for playing himself), but with Jill around he is forced to have to listen to her problems too, especially while she is trying online dating. Hoping to get rid of his sister Jack decides to spruce up Jill's online dating profile, and sure enough she gets up to one hundred responses from men interested, she even goes out with a man calling himself Funbucket (Norm MacDonald), but of course he is scared off by her when they do go out. Feeling guilty, Jack decides Jill needs cheering up, and hoping that Al Pacino will be there too, he takes her to a Lakers game, and he does get to talk to Pacino, and the actor meanwhile spots and develops a crush on his sister. Jack was hoping that Jill would leave by New Year's Eve, since he and his wife and kids and planning a cruise, and his work colleagues find out that he has a twin sister, so they extend the birthday party they were throwing for him so that she is part of the celebration too, and later Pacino takes her to his place to pick her own birthday cake. The next day Jill is planning to go home, but Jack's gardener Felipe (Eugenio Derbez) takes her for some fun in the park, and Jack wants to invite her on the cruise so she is not alone on New Year's, but she doesn't want to go. Also Pacino will only agree to do the donuts commercial if he gets a date with Jill, and he was told that she will be on the cruise with the family, so Jack sees no choice but to use his identical twin status, and disguise himself as his sister to do on the date. On the date Pacino really expresses that he really cares for the real Jill, and Jack realises he does care about his sister, but he finds out that he disguised himself as her, and has gone back home to the Bronx. Jill goes into a restaurant feeling sorry for herself, and there a group of old high school classmates are there, including Monica (Razzie winning \u2013 for supporting actress \u2013 David Spade) who teases and taunts her, but Jack and family show up to support her, Jack does fight with Monica, but they all return home. Back at Jill's house they all make up, and Felipe has decorated the place to declare his love for her, she is overjoyed as someone loves her, and they embrace, and soon after Pacino shows up, in his performance swashbuckling costume to show his love too. In the end Pacino stepped down seeing that Jill is in love with someone else, but he still did do a commercial, where he is advertising and promoting Dunkaccino coffee with a rap song, but he hates it and tells Jack to destroy it and all copies. Also starring Derbez as Felipe's Grandma, Razzie nominated Nick Swardson as Todd, Tim Meadows as Ted, Allen Covert as Otto, Dana Carvey as Scrapply Puppeteer, Johnny Depp, Shaquille 'Shaq' O'Neal, Regis Philbin, Drew Carey, Michael Irvin, Jared Fogle, Dennis Dugan as Al Pacino's Standby and Rob Schneider as Alan. There are some people who like Sandler and his films, and there are some who don't, I'm sort of in-between, because I really liked Big Daddy, but some of his films are silly, and some are just bad, this is easily very bad, and he deserved his two Razzies. The acting is pretty terrible, Sandler is worst as his female character, Pacino tries to mock his serious actor image but just makes himself look like his career is dwindling, and Spade is awful also dressed as a woman, this is probably the lowest of the low for cross-dressing comedies, none of it made me laugh, none of it is original, and Jill is easily one of the most loathsome creatures on screen, don't bother with this piece of garbage, a stupid comedy. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Ensemble for the entire cast, Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel, Worst Screen Couple for Sandler & EITHER Holmes, Pacino, OR Sandler and Worst Screenplay.

Back in the day, his baby sounds and squished faces were not only cute but hilarious. Now, like all humans, he gets older, but mentally is stuck in the 90's where people found his movies very funny. Now, the strange thing is, Adam Sandler has proved a couple of times that he could be a good dramatic actor. I'm not sure why he hasn't moved on\u0085 probably because his best friends are desperate for money and he's got to keep his dumb movie company \"Happy Madison\" going, so naturally he writes a bad story with predictable jokes and for some reason he thinks he's so funny, so naturally the movie somehow gets green lighted and that leads us to Jack and Jill. I was warned several times that this movie was awful, but one of my friends wanted to see this movie and rented it. She begged me to watch it with her and told me that I should keep an open mind\u0085fair enough, right? I was thinking I was too close minded and I should let go and just have a good laugh. So during the movie, my expression did not change, I just couldn't laugh at anything\u0085I look over and my friend is laughing hysterically. Why am I not having the same reaction? I don't know, but I guess I'm one of the rare people that are seeing the down fall of society with Sandler's movies.Jack, a successful advertising executive in Los Angeles with a beautiful wife and two kids, Sofie and Gary. Jack is incredibly irritated about the Thanksgiving visit of his \"identical\" twin sister Jill. Following a series of problems from the airport to the house, Jack's patience is soon stretched increasingly thin. Jill's neediness and passive-aggressiveness is maddening to Jack, turning his normally tranquil life upside down. Jill says she has a list of things she wants to do before she leaves; she wants to be on a game show, go horseback riding, and do a studio tour. Meanwhile, Jack's client wants him to get Al Pacino to appear in a Dunkin Donuts commercial. Jill tries online dating, but doesn't get much of a response until Jack alters her profile, leading her to get over 100 responses. Jack feels bad so he takes her to the Lakers game where Al Pacino is supposed to be. He is there and he develops a crush on Jill as he gives her his phone number. Now the commercial is dependent on her taking a liking to Al Pacino.One thing that I wonder: what the heck did Adam Sandler do to these celebrities who make a cameo in the film? Johnny Depp, one of the greatest actors of our generation makes a cameo. Shaq\u0085well, I withdraw my question on that one. But Al Pacino, did Adam Sandler take a picture of the guy luring children into his gingerbread house or something? But given credit where it's due, Al seems to be the only one putting any effort into this movie. Adam Sandler's character of Jill is very close in the running for most obnoxious characters in cinema history. What I don't get is how in this universe that anyone can stand her? She's loud, racist, crude, ugly and just plain annoying, yet somehow people defend her and somehow 2 guys get a crush on her?! Plus I love how in every Sandler movie now that he writes, his character is: successful, \"good-looking\", has a gorgeous wife, smart, witty and everyone just admires him of course. This movie in itself is a big joke and I really tried to enjoy myself, but just have to go with the negative reviews on this film, it really is that bad. As for people like other users and my friend who found it funny, try watching other movies. I promise, there's a whole world of comedy out there that is much better than this.1/10",

I've seen my fair share of bad comedies, you know the one's where you might laugh slightly once but it has little redeeming factors, well this is one movie that doesn't even have that little laugh. Adam Sandler plays both of the twin siblings of the movies name, Sandler literally creates the offspring of the devil in the form of Jill, not only does he make this high and whiny voice for her but he also just makes her the worst character of the lot.Sandler looks bored in this film and at times it feels like he made this one week when he couldn't be bothered to think of anything at all. Of all the things that happen in this the cameos stick out for me the most with such celebrities as Johnny Depp, John McEnroe and Sandler's old buddy David Spade popping up. Hey I have nothing against cameos in movies but when their in a movie of such low calibre, well you just have to think what the hell did they think this was going to be I mean it's worse than awful, they were just unneeded by Sandler.OK so let's get onto that story, twins meet up, Jill the twin feels bad, wants to fall in love, yada yada yada it's all a mess. You know I could forgive the plot though if this movie actually tried in the comedic department I mean it's just like come on with every joke, whether it's a fart joke or another fart joke, or something to do with faeces this never fails to amaze me in just how poorly a joke can be done. If I had to name my one favourite part it's when anything bad happens to the characters, I just hoped these people in the story would fade away and be replaced by nothing, yes I would rather watch 91 minutes of an empty room than 91 minutes of this garbage can of a movie.I want to add that Sandler has actually gone down in my expectations; I know I know some of his other films have been way below average but to sink to this level, well it feels like an entirely new low for him. The fact that Sandler wrote this just makes it even worse, the direction is one bad thing but the writing is just terrible, the movie lacks any cutting edge material and even then it lacks basic run of the mill stuff in fact it breaks the mill and drowns it completely.So yes Jack and Jill, there isn't really too much to add on this, a really awful movie that should never really have been conceived as an idea let alone a movie. Oh I almost forgot that Al Pacino was in this movie, that's right, an Oscar winning actor was in this movie and literally in one second of his first appearance in this movie threw his entire acting integrity onto a cliff-edge, how he decided this was the right move in his career I will never know, and how Sandler coaxed anyone who appeared in this into it, well it baffles the mind.",

His been in terrible movies since his career started and not one of his films are good(well Hotel Transylvania was good,and The Wedding Singer was good)but he always plays the same passive/aggressive jerk in EVERY MOVIE his BEEN IN. I swear its like his trying to impersonate Ben Stiller and his WAY better than this dude.Anyway Jack and Jill is definitely the worst film I have ever seen after White Chicks from the Wayan Brothers as it was god-awful. Here he plays Jack a executive producer who is filming a commercial and wants a famous celebrity to star in it. And yup guess who is in his soon to be commercial, Al Pacino YES the dude from Scareface and that mediocre film $imone is IN this film. Seriously???But Jack has to pick up his sister Jill(played by yup Adam Sandler in drag,sporting a Fran Drescher accent which is terrible btw) who is coming back from wherever she/he lives and celebrates Thanksgiving with Jack and his wife Erin(god bless Mrs Ex Tom Cruise herself Katie Holmes for starring in this **** of a movie). As Jill spends some time with Jack and his family,Pacino wants a date with Jill so you can guess what happens in a parody of Mrs Doubtfire gone wrong scenario.Overall I highly recommend you to NOT watch this film. Its a waste of time and the actors time and having Sandler done up in drag is terrible I mean god I knew straight away it was him with the dark long wig and the fat suit on him,and wearing make up instead of prosthetics to make him more feminine looking.0/10",

I got about halfway-three quarters away through before there was a scene in the woods where Jack&Jill were arguing and Jill throws her pet bird out of the shot and is forgotten about. At the very end of it the homeless friend has the bird between two buns and he says \"It flew into my buns\"....c'mon, so at that point, failed joke after failed joke, I left.

            "content": "Categorically twins have an interesting nature about them. Similarities no single born child will endeavour. Although Adam Sandler continuously pumps out farcical acts, literally playing the same character time and time again, a brief interest rose due to Sandler acting fifty per cent male and fifty per cent female. Back in the 90s Sandler's infantile belligerence was fresh, devilish and entertained the masses, fitting in with the era of bratty youngsters. Regrettably as Sandler has aged this has morphed into an irritable middle aged bore. Therefore we experience no distinctive change in this feature from characters played in Grown Ups and Funny People.Jack and Jill is painfully shoddier than any of his recent attempts at comedy. Sandler's female character is simply a high-pitched version of Jack with the same motives and attitude to characterisation. Jack is poor and dull whilst Jill's squealing is agonisingly uncomfortable to listen to. If we were expecting Sandler to make an adaptation of Robin Williams' splendid Mrs Doubtfire, it would be recommended to stray away from these twins. Finding your father prancing around in your mother's garments would be far more amusing, although in reality this would drive most into a tender mental rehabilitation. The most entertaining spectrum is the temperament of Jack's adopted son who marvellously straps haphazard objects or animals to himself in an attempt to stamp his cultural disparity from the luxurious directorship lifestyle that Jack has built. Katy Holmes is bland and takes a short hit with reference to her late husband attempting to encourage her to follow a cult which is particularly clever and snappy.A short cameo from Johnny Depp can go unrecognised. He seems to spend more time featuring in other people's films rather than prancing around as Jack the pirate. I suppose this is what starring in a lacklustre, pitiful garbage with Angelina Jolie does for you. Al Paccino also stars as himself, rather comically falling for Jill and although only standing at four foot he certainly gives a healthier presentation of himself than Sandler's double act. I beg of you not to expect too much from him though as he characteristically fails to reach the heights The Godfather series and the epic Scarface. Although a change of genre can occasionally bring out the worst in some performers. See Sandler's commercial starring Pacino and you'll want to curl up in a corner and weep.Unless Sandler retires a change of performance is regrettably not on the cards. His inability to adapt to varying types of characters will be remembered more so than his moody and juvenile temperament. He is simply not pragmatic when it comes to variety.",

One Sandler still making outdated comedies is more than enough. To have two Sandlers in the same film is the stuff of nightmares. The catalyst in creating a colossal black hole that will end the universe as we know it. Sandler dressing as a woman to portray a twin sister should be disallowed. Illegal. A crime against humanity. It's not even a case of the comedy being outdated, because I am one million percent sure it still would not be funny. Twenty, thirty, heck make it fifty years. Toilet humour isn't funny (including but not limited to farting in the cinema, violently excreting after consuming Mexican food and explicitly scratching one's testicles). Annoying characters aren't funny. Sandler isn't funny. Two Sandlers aren't funny. Sandler dressed as a female purposefully showing off his masculine shaved legs isn't funny. You see my point. I'm not even going to describe the plot, it would be a waste of a sentence that could be better used to decimate this atrocity. Holmes was underus...wait...wasn't used at all. The screenplay contained absolutely zero laughs. I didn't even smile, not even a smirk. Just large glaring eyes as I stared at the screen bewildered by what I just experienced. Pacino...why? The only one with a worthwhile committed performance, because he was playing himself. No acting required. Although subjugating yourself to an advertisement for donuts where you sing \"Dunkaccino\" does make you wonder why such an acclaimed actor would do this. The last line of the film is \"Burn this! Don't let anybody see this!\". Ironically, I feel the same about this film. Thinking about watching this? Go outside, run to the local store, buy (or perhaps steal...) a copy of the film and give it to your best friend. Then watch them suffer as you laugh maniacally. That'll make for a more amusing time then watching this. Sandler can no longer come back from this. His professional career is officially deceased in my eyes. Goodbye.",

This might provide humour for ten minutes in another film, where the protagonist has already been established.

Let's get on to the strangeness *behind* this surprisingly horrible film.The interesting thing is that it's horrible by design, in the sense that it isn't bad because the people making it were inexperienced or simply among the worst in the entire film industry.

'Independence Day' cost 5 million less than this and you have much, much, much higher production values. The film's actual cost of production looks to have been closer to about 5 million, if that. The rest went to line the pockets of... Well, I'm sure you can make an educated guess.The commercial product placement alone is beyond the pale - there is a full-blown TV style commercial right in the middle for a cruise line. It looks like a TV commercial, it feels like a TV commercial, then you're back to movie-land. The cruise line was so kind to shoot footage for them!Dunkin Donuts also bears much of the shame for this entire debacle. They have a commercial at the end that is just... Well, it's so bad you have to see it. It will leave you with absolutely no respect for Al Pacino, if you had any left after making it through the majority of the film. I don't know what sort of bills he has to pay, but they must be horrific if he's accepting work like this now.This is one of those movies that will end up in film criticism text books citing how bad things became at this point in history. If it were only so bad that it became unintentionally funny, it would deserve a spot on the wall with Mano: Hands of Fate. But it's deliberately bad, just the bare minimum to pose as a film and get money into the hands of the producer and his friends. The sad thing is, they did nothing illegal. Not even Uwe Boll financially questionable. They just figured out how to game the system, I congratulate them on that. The sales execs at Pepto-Bismol, Coke, Royal Canadian Cruise Lines, Dunkin Donuts and Sony really need to learn when to draw the line on product placement. But this is really a case where no one could say no, to the detriment of all that is good in this world.See this movie at some point, but do not spend any money to do so. See it only to know how bad movies can be.",

            "content": "JACK AND JILL has quite a notorious reputation achieved through all these years. It won the most Razzie Awards a movie has ever received (including the one for both worst actor and worst actress for Adam Sandler), here it has 3,2 and it's currently #48 in the infamous Bottom 100. These reasons alone bought me to finally sit through this movie some months ago, and unfortunately, I had to agree with almost all the haters.Jack Sadelstein (Sandler) is a publicist that one day has the chance of having his big break if he hires Al Pacino for appearing in a new commercial about a new brand of Cappuccino named Dunkacino (pun intended). Unfortunately, it's the Thanksgiving period and Jack's sister Jill (again Sandler) comes for staying at his home for a few days, and she is anything than subtle! What follows is exactly lots of pointless scenarios including Al Pacino that has an infatuation for Jill, Jack's bum friends that come to his dinner and so on and so forth.I wanted to give JACK AND JILL a chance, but as it progressed, I thought the level of intelligence in my brain was lowering. The humour was very flat, it never made me laugh not even once and I waited 90 minutes for that ONE joke that probably could have saved this movie, but it never came. The acting is awful: Adam Sandler has made some great comedies including even some of his straight to Netflix ones, but he has never been annoying here as both Jack and Jill! Al Pacino and Katie Holmes look like they are here just for the paycheck, while David Spade and Shaquille O'Neal in tiny pointless cameos? They were right in their element! Only the cinematography and soundtrack were good, but at times the editing felt very rushed.In substance, a cult classic of bad movies that should be seen at least once just for saying that there has never been anything like it before. Clearly this movie deserves to be in the halloweed Bottom 100 of IMDB.",

I enjoyed most of his other films, but this movie was a mistake. I can only imagine that he's gotten to that point in his career where he has surrounded himself with \"Yes\" men and women, or someone would have told him it's not working. Unlike other films where actor/comedians are able to pull of multiple characters in a scene, (ie. Eddie Murphy), this film is just Adam Sandler and an annoying Adam Sandler in drag. Part of the limited plot surrounds trying to convince Al Pacino to lower his standards to do a Dunkin Donut commercial. After appearing in this film, I think it would be a leg up for Pacino's career. The whole main plot-line barely made sense. I mean, why would an establish legend in Al Pacino (playing himself) be attracted to Jill (Sandler in drag). I also didn't like how earlier Jill was introduced. There was no build up to her character, and no suspense.If you plan to watch this film, I'd advise you to wait a couple weeks for Netflix to feature it for free or online, or basically anywhere in which you won't be paying!. Then, at least, you won't feel obliged to watch more than the first 15 minutes. It really was a waste a time and one of the worst films of 2011 (if not the worst).",

After that nothing seem to be too bad, definitely nothing was too good, but it came to this \"movie\", because I was letting girlfriend decide what movie we would see. I didn't even see the poster, nothing, didn't read reviews (WRONG), just went in the theater. My hipothesis is that Maybe some tech-head approached Adam Sandler and went \"Hey, look this new program, how easy and good a scene with the same actor in two characters can be done\"... and in some way, after some drinks and a winding road, this \"movie\" came to light. Low, cheap, tasteless, gross and disgusting humor are all together here along with the worst acting I have seen in years. Then the bold commercial endorsement, it's just disgusting. I just paid $10 for watching a freaking 2 hour long Dunkin Donut commercial.I think the worst of all is the load of famous and respectable people making cameos here.

Kate Holmes doesn't have a lot of lines - it could have been anyone in her role.

The title is about the height of creativity. Jack is a family man who reluctantly invites his twin sister over for the holiday and as predictable formulas go they do not see eye to eye despite being so much alike. It is obvious that Jill will drive Jack crazy but not nearly as much as the film drove me crazy. The plot is simple and its big joke of Sandler in drag is not as inspiring or as funny as the film's makers wish for us to believe. Sandler and director Dennis Dugan have collaborated numerous times and only You Don't Mess With the Zohan is their best at this time. Sandler has done well in both comedies and even dramatic pictures such as Punch Drunk Love but throwing a wig, dress and makeup on him makes him look more creepy than funny, and throwing his voice is phony. Katie Holmes as Jack's wife is standard support centre and one dimensional. Al Pacino takes a real risk playing himself falling head over heels for Jill. Jack seeks Pacino for a commercial he is putting together and Pacino seems to be laughing at himself. His final scene at a restaurant is over the top but we shouldn't expect a Godfather type performance here. Then we have a slew of other Sandler regulars fitting in with the foolishness. All in all this film is devoid in laughs rendering Sandler, not Jack, to fall down and break more than his crown. Score: 1 \u00bd / 10",

Knowing this, Jack plans to use her to get Pacino into his commercial. It feels like no time was put into this film and that Sandler just got a piece of paper and brainstormed ideas that sounded funny and could be movie material. He relies on all of his old tricks including farting and slapstick comedy in their laziest forms and does not try to formulate one creative joke outside of things that might get shock laughs or appeal to the people who think farting and people falling down are hilarious.It has one of the worst stories I have ever seen in film there is not a single character you can relate to or possibly like.

However, this is one time when I should have researched a film before I watched it. If you look at the online reviews you'll see what I mean.The other thing I should point out is that my 'review' is only based on the first half an hour. That was all I could stand. I'm sorry. I hope I'm not doing this film a massive disservice by not watching it in its entirety. Perhaps it really picked up and I missed some real comic gold. However, from the opening act, I really don't think so.Adam Sadler plays two roles - twins Jack and his 'identical' sister Jill. Jill comes to stay with his family and 'hilarity' results. Unfortunately, Jill is the most annoying character ever to grace cinema screens. I know what you're thinking - you're thinking that you've seen the Phantom Menace and that no one can top Jar Jar Binks. Wrong! Seriously, it's like Jar Jar has had a baby with Ruby Rhod from the Fifth Element and produced Jill. All she does is shriek on and on, in between generally being rude and stupid and insensitive towards anyone who is unlucky enough to get near her.Now, I have nothing against annoying characters in films. If a character is annoying then that's part of who they are. My problem with Jack and Jill is how other characters deal with them. If we meet someone annoying, we stay well clear. However, in this film everyone extends her too much courtesy to make it believable. Yes, I know she's family, but even so, you wouldn't let her anywhere near you if you know what she's like. Yet, everyone makes massive allowances for her, even berating her long-suffering twin brother Jack (who is pretty unlikeable in himself) for not being nicer to her.In short, there is not a rating low enough to describe this rubbish. Do not watch it, it's truly that bad. The only thing vaguely interesting about it is how they persuaded Al Pacino to appear in it.

If you thought Battlefield Earth was legendary for its number of Raspberry Awards it won, you have no idea. Granted, it's not Adam Sandler's biggest stinker to date, (That's My Boy is) but it's the most notorious. First off, why is Al Pachino in this movie? Oh, God, why is he in this movie? Was Sandler just trying to ruin everyone's career at this point? I'm not even kidding when I say Johnny Depp only has a brief unrecognized role. I think he's relieved that not many people will notice he's in this movie. Apparently, $80 mil went into the production of this. Where did this budget go? I put my money on the celebrity cameos. Think about it; the movie \"FoodFight\" cost half as much to make, and it had CG animation and celebrity actors as well. Jack and Jill are the most horrendous twins to exist. I have no idea if they're identical or fraternal at this point. Is Jill just a really an ugly cross-dresser who thought we wouldn't notice. That's right, Jill is clearly Adam Sandler with a wig. I'm not trying to offend any twins at this point, but I have no doubt this movie is. Many of Sandler's movies are based around the importance of family, and they try to be a comedy at the same time. I can respect that, but not if there's no thought process behind it. This could have worked, but instead, they were just jacking off. And I promise, that's the only other Jack joke I'm making in this review Like I said, I found That's My Boy to be the worst movie in Sandler's career, but there seem to be a handful fans who support it. With this movie, that's not the case. I haven't seen a single positive review about this movie. It's a complete waste of time and money, with horrible acting, nonsensical plot, stupid dialogue, and an overabundance of celebrities. I refuse to give this movie a rating here because IMDb reviewers can't give out zero star ratings.

Burn it.TLDR: Don't.Grade: H",

            "content": "Seriously, this movie is so bad, even Nostalgia Critic wouldn't touch it.I cannot express the stupidity in words. It began on a sunny afternoon at my local mall Christmas shopping - a tradition between me and my friends. In this tradition, we always saw a movie afterwards. Unable to decide, we let our newcomer friend pick one at random- Jack and Jill. I knew even from the moronic poster it would be a flop- but rumor had it, sweetheart Johnny Depp was in it, so off we went- $11.50 down the drain as we entered the theater.So many things are wrong with this movie, I don't even know where to begin. I guess the first point would be the totally confusing audience range Sandler tries to aim for. If he was trying for a children's movie- he sadly failed, as there is sexual innuendo, swearing, and all sorts of disastrous adult jokes which screech off the rails. If he was trying for an adults movie- he also failed, with the fact no adult in their right mind set would enjoy Sandler dressing in drag and farting, scratching his genitals, talking in a nails-down-a-chalkboard voice, and just being a frustration for the ninety minutes.The other point that really frustrated me throughout this movie, is the jokes. Nobody laughed in the theater. Actually, there is one humorous part in the beginning, during a montage of twins, talking about their relationship with one another, and one twin claims to talk to his twin in 'whale' language. Kudos, whale man, for the only laugh of the afternoon. The jokes aren't funny. Things are seemingly thrown in at random for laughs, like a hobo joining their Thanksgiving (??!). It is almost insulting to think we would find the humor funny. This frustrating feeling will last with you throughout the movie.Another strange fact is the celebrities. My poor, sweet, Johnny Depp. Perhaps you are a friend of Adam, perhaps you were looking to pay off something, because I can't believe you would appear in such a movie. I know why the movie hired you of course- I went in with the high hope of seeing Depp, unable to believe he would act in such a disaster. So in reality, Depp's five minute role as himself was what lured in most of the movie's profit. Johnny Depp, it's alright, Im sure its not your fault, you may weep on Mr Burton's shoulder, vowing to never leave his side again.Al Pachino is also in this movie (confused yet?) as he is pretty much a big part of the story, because Jack wants him to do a commercial for a new brand of coffee (chino...gettit? Aha..ha) and Pachino is struck by Jill and is in love with her, who does not return his affections.What results is a very predictable and unfunny climax which tries to shadow the climax of Mrs Doubtfire but is so insulting it is hard to watch, and some lovey family stuff is thrown in as well, which confuses me whether this movie was intended for children. Jill gets with the guy we knew from the first moment we saw would end up with her, and everything is happy and gay.THEN we get the most god-awful scene in cinema history. A rapping Al Pachino. Rapping. Yes, you read that correctly. About coffee. Doesn't that just make you feel all dead inside? For the love of god, do not see this movie. Make no attempt to see this movie. Don't even rent it. It is a disaster.",

            "content": "I have the uncivil duty of reviewing what is considered a universally panned failure of a film as it swept the 2011 Razzies, which celebrates the worst films of the year. After seeing all of the horrible reviews about the film, I am here to inform you that those reviews are sadly correct. I have absolutely no clue as to why abhorrent movies like these still take hundreds of millions of dollars every year from idiots who can't tell the difference between \"The Shawshank Redemption\" from \"Disaster Movie\".This comedy, if you can even call it that, failed to get even a giggle out of me due to the horrendous screenplay that tries to make humor for kids (since it is trying to be a PG movie), but ends up falling flat on its face at every turn. This makes even the laughably short running time of 90 minutes feel like an eternity, though I'm thankful it wasn't any longer or I would have lost all of my sanity watching this horrible excuse of a film. These are some of the most irritating and unlikable characters I have ever seen in any film, except for Katie Holmes, who is severely underdeveloped (again, thanks to the laughable excuse of a screenplay).The only good part about the film is Al Pacino as he gets the only funny line of the film, which turns out to be a meta-joke relating to his impact(or lack thereof) as an actor in the 2000s. What makes the film different from all the other detestable comedies and what also does not make it the worst film in history is that I can see effort put into this film, even if it does jam in product placement constantly. At least it's better than ramming down poorly written movie spoof jokes every second like \"Disaster Movie\". There is at least some comprehensible story, even if it is a horrible story.The only excuse that you should have for watching this cringe-inducing film is if you have some friends over on a Friday night with nothing to do and you want to have a drinking game about all of the unfunny jokes in this film. Otherwise, avoid this at all costs.This movie doesn't deserve a rating, period.",

Grow up, Adam.I actually thought this film had a heart, something not many Sandler films have. And, of course, it's fun to watch Adam Sandler being Milton Berle. How Sandler got so many stars to appear in cameos (e.g., Dana Carvey, Christie Brinkley, Johnny Depp, Bruce Jenner, John McEnroe, Shaquille O'Neal, Regis Philbin)...and have Al Pacino co-star throughout the movie as himself...well, Sandler must be very well-liked in Hollywood. But all these appearances help make this a fun...if still low brow...film to watch.The story, as I said, does have a heart. Twins have grown apart as one matured and became (dare I say it) more sophisticated (Adam), while the other remained a bull in a china shop (actually, also Adam, as a female). Through an odd set of occurrences, the female finds love (albeit not Al Pacino), and the male learns to appreciate his twin sister.

            "content": "Jack and Jill is a hideous movie that aims for the lowest common denominator. This isn't comedy, it's desperation and laziness. Like many a comedian before him, Sandler has decided to take on duel roles as brother and sister. When will these people realise they are not Peter Sellers or Alec Guinness. It takes great skill to seamlessly integrate yourself as more than one character. Here all I saw was Sandler in drag. Jack and Jill is about Jack, a director of commercials trying to land Al Pacino in a Dunken Donuts commercial. His sister arrives for Thanksgiving and she is the most horrible human being you can imagine. This was my biggest problem with the movie. There is nothing to connect us with this foul waste of space. Like Mater in Cars 2, this character is infuriating, She has no people skills. SHe is offensive, ignorant, loud, and just revolting. Sandler must feel destroyed by his family in some way, because with this and Click, he shows himself as a decent hard working man, constantly shat on my his family. Holmes is the worst wife in the world, not to mention a bland character. She repeatedly enables Jill to continue acting the way she does. The film tries to squeeze out some emotion, but fails, because we hate this bitch. If she was bullied when she was young, then perhaps the film makers should have shown this. Pacino has a lot of fun as himself, but the only way I wasn't embarrassed was by imagining his pay cheque. On top of all this the jokes aren't funny and the editing is abysmal. One scene sets up a joke, as Jill must find her way home without a car, and then it skips the punchline and gives us one to a scene they never showed us. It's confusing. As is the moment when the movie tried to get laughs from showing the face of Felipe's grandmother. I didn't know why they kept showing her, but once I looked on IMDb, I saw the same actor played both Felipe and the grandmother. This joke doesn't work if you don't know that. The film avoids the lowest rating barely, by having some fun jokes. Such as Johnny Depp in a Justin Bieber T-Shirt, or Spade mocking Rob Schneider. Predictable, crude, heartless, and annoying. This is a film that must be hated.",

            "content": "Jack (Adam Sandler) is an advertising executive under a strict deadline to try and bring actor Al Pacino in to star his commercial for Dunkin Donuts. Jack is a family man, married to his wife (Katie Holmes), with their two kids. Yet Jack is reluctant to welcome his sister Jill (also played by Sandler), who is visiting for Thanksgiving, into his house. She is loud, rude and awkwardly behaved but also lonely. Jack has the bright idea of trying to find her a man to keep her busy. At a basketball game Jack and Jill bump into Pacino himself and the man is immediately infatuated with Jack's sister. Jack tries to capitalised on this situation by encouraging her to call Pacino but she isn't particularly taken with him. Early on in this unfunny comedy Sandler's character calls someone out for being borderline anti-Semitic. He tells the man that only he can do it because he is Jewish. Is this self-assurance? Sandler was born of Jewish parents in Brooklyn and that alone asks us whether it's acceptable for the likes Sandler to take aim at his own people, rather than someone else's ethnicity. It's meant to be self-parody rather than prejudice so it must be inoffensive right? The answer to me is no but neither Sandler nor his long-term director Dennis Dugan care. They've made no less than seven films together, which means he thinks Sandler is funny and bankable but not necessarily in that order. These people should not be making films. They have only the most threadbare knowledge of filmmaking and even less regard for storytelling itself. They hurriedly clump threads and skits together simply to cater to an audience that I will never understand: one unconcerned by characterisation, representation, reality or purpose. The only intention this film has is to judge characters solely on appearance rather than action. Jill is from Brooklyn and has a voice so grating that she makes Fran Drescher sound soothing. I had to put my fingers in my ears the first time I heard it. Sandler recycles a lot of the same clich\u00e9s Drescher embraced in her show The Nanny years ago: the big hair, the excessive luggage, the voice. But this film is straight up mean- spirited. Jill is apparently so dumb that she can't even use a computer. She has no friends or social skills. By choosing to play her himself Sandler immediately deprives her of being a normal person. She becomes literally a joke, without any semblance of charm or humanity. He intends for us to dislike her but for what reason? I think it says a lot about people's expectations of cinema knowing there was so much laughing and clapping during the screening. Not only is the film cruel but it offers little more than a checklist of the lowest brand of comedy. Prepare for fart jokes, fat jokes, vision of ear wax, perspiration and armpit hair. People twenty and over find this appealing? It's dumb, obvious and not funny. I barely laughed once and the belated attempts at sentimental family values are condescending and hypocritical. I took most offense to the scene involving a Mexican soccer game. A Mexican character, a gardener of course, frequently makes jokes about stealing and sneaking into places but assures us he's joking. He introduces his kids who all have the same name and during a soccer match we keep cutting to his grandmother with one tooth, who keeps glaring at people. Pathetic. That's before the other Mexicans stuff huge chillies into their mouths. Also pathetic. I find it sad that in the space of a year we've had no less than two films associate Mexican food with diarrhoea. A lot will be made by how obnoxious Sandler is as Jill and quite rightly too. There's not a positive note in his performance. Yet this will overshadow how dull and bored he looks as Jack. A few years ago, P.T. Anderson took Sandler out of his comfort zone, giving him a performance so haunting that few could really believe that it was Happy Gilmore himself. Financially, Punch Drunk Love (2002) tanked badly and Sandler has never returned to anything as daring. He doesn't even look like he's trying here. I don't know why Katie Holmes agreed to this movie beyond a paycheck because she has nothing to do. And are things that dire for Pacino? He's depressing and his final scene involving a commercial is frankly an embarrassment. Though somehow the old dog draws a faint smile when he says: \"Burn this\". Self-parody? Self-assurance? Great awareness.",

It is one of the worst movies of the year. Sandler stars as Jack Sadelstein, a successful Los Angeles ad executive whose ludicrous twin sister Jill comes to visit Jack and his family from the Bronx. Jill wreaks havoc in Jack's life and his quest to get Al Pacino to be a spokesperson in a Dunkin Doughnut commercial. Are you still with me? Sandler plays both roles adequately, but the characters do grow doubly-tiresome during the second half of the movie. Katie Holmes co-stars as Jack's simpleton wife. She served no purpose in this film, as this film served no purpose to the film industry. Director Dennis Dugan, a Sandler favorite, directs the movie with the same old running gags and jokes he has in his previous films; he just incorporates it within the twin killing premise. One can say that \"Jack and Jill\" is an identical twin in \"lack of comedy\" style as other Sandler-starring Dugan bombs such as \"Grown Ups\", \"Just Go With It\", \"Big Daddy\", and \"I Pronounce You Chuck & Larry\". I must duganly confess that I am a big fan of Dugan's \"You Don't Mess With The Zohan\" also starring Sandler. Speaking of Adam, the man is a proved comedic & dramatic talent, but I don't know why he keeps insisting on having Dugan be his directorial mainstay on most of his films from his Happy Gilmore production company. Sandler and co-scripter Steven Koren's screenplay was a double-trouble of \"over the top\" verbal hysteria. I must state that I did enjoy Al Pacino portraying himself not so much for his performance, but for the subtle homage of his past classic performances in several of the Pacino scenes in the movie. But that is all that was a ball and gave a thrill to \"Jack and Jill\". Stay away from \"Jack and Jill\" or else you'll pay! ** Needs Improvement",

Everyone has an \"ugly duckling\" relative who does not fit in with the family, and everyone tries to be nice in an attempt to compensate for what appears to be \"Nature's mistake.\" Jack looks OK for a guy, but the same features and athletic body build make Jill a freak or \"loser\" in the eyes of most people. What makes the movie funny for me is the way Jack's movie-star handsome, celebrity friends find Jill fascinating and attractive because she is big and strong enough to participate with them in male-dominated sports and actually wind the games. Could it be men really do not like the sweet and feminine type like Jack's wife? Could it be they really like the opposite, such as Jill? It seems Jack's friends are so smitten with Jill that they cannot get enough of being around her. It is the men's unusual reaction that makes the movie funny in an ironic way.Without giving away too much, I found the jet ski scene incredibly funny. Jill tries too hard in everything she does, and the jet ski overshooting the swimming pool is the most hilarious slapstick bit of humor I have seen in a long time. My husband considered the film too much of a chick flick, but I have recommended the film to my friends, and we hope to see it on DVD on our next \"girls' night out.\"",

            "content": "0/5Oh Adam Sandler, how you have degraded. From his glory days of Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison and Big Daddy, this is truly the unfortunate trough in his career. Remember when your parents stopped or discouraged you from watching a screen because it apparently eroded your braincells? Well, here's something that validates that particular nag. Being comfortably amongst the worst if not the worst film I have seen, I'm going to do something I've never done and unhesitatingly award this film zero. After becoming the talk of the town following its sweeping of the Razzies, the first time a film has ever done so, it attracted my interest. Ultimately, to genuinely appreciate works of art in cinema, we need to be able to identify and understand the flip side. This represents a pin-up example, one of those ill-fated catastrophes where there is nothing to praise in any way and everything to vilify. There have unquestionably been worse premises for comedies but it was execution that let this down miserably. Execution in every possible facet of cinema. The story was lame, predictable and exceeded the limits of senselessness and brainlessness that an individual can tolerate. The dialogue is unintelligibly stupid and unfunny. I couldn't help but disconnect from it. And in all honesty, even if I was paying rapt attention, I doubt I would have found anything that could be remotely termed as comedy. Adam Sandler is by no stretch of the imagination a poor comedian but this is the nadir of his work. Jack is the bread and butter Sandler character that we just seem to see in every film of his nowadays. Jill, on the other hand, is easily his most calamitous creation yet. She resembles a transvestite and I think that statement conveys my thoughts of the character best. There is just no clear distinction between the two characters Sandler played simultaneously. Playing multiple roles begs the ability to seamlessly absorb yourself into each separate character and forge an identity for each. In a comic context, Mike Myers did this brilliantly in 'Austin Powers'. In this case, without offence intended, all I could see was a cross-dressing Adam Sandler employing a cringeworthy, transsexual sounding voice. Jill eventually does little to dispel these negative perceptions, she's just an annoying, unintelligent pest. I'm unsure as to how I sat through this cinematic disaster but I did so staring blankly at the screen. I can waffle on about the deficits of this forever but take it from me, nothing redeemed it, nothing helped it and every minute made it even worse. The only reason you'll ever need to see this is to understand the lowest quality of cinematic art.",

It was absolutely horrible, but I rate it a 3 because of the little laughs I had throughout the movie. Adam Sandler, Katie Holmes, Nick Swardson, the famous Al Pacino, David Spade and more, a stacked cast did horrible. About Al Pacino, the most famous and best actor in the world did horrible, the worst in the movie. The writer and directer made Pacino look horrible, they made Pacino look like the worst actor ever. Pacino shouldn't have accepted the role, he is more for thriller, horror, and sci fi movies. Come on Pacino, think!

Each and every movie since, has been worse than the last. This movie is cringe worthy. He plays the same character in every film. What was cute in his first films is now fingernails-running-down-a-chalkboard bad. He obviously has a following that is very loyal and he is wildly successful with his production company. He churns out movie after movie with former Saturday Night Live alumni with his production company. He has played it very smart in that respect. But, with the exception of Kevin James, his movies continue to do less and less at the box office. But, because of his early success, he is a bankable actor and producer, so he gets the last laugh. That doesn't change the fact that this is a squirm-in-your-seat bad film. It is surprising that his films continue to get green lit without question. Sooner or later you would think they would want a hit from him to justify financing. All of his films aren't terrible. And I would love to be in his shoes.

            "content": "Jack and Jill Sadelstien are twins with very different lifestyles. While Jack is a wealthy commercial advertising director who runs his own company and has beautiful family with a gorgeous wife (Katie Holmes) Jill is a small town girl who grew up and lived with her mother all her life. Jill has not had any luck in her love life and is in some sorts quite clingy and needy and has very peculiar behavior patterns. Jacks largest client Dunkin Donuts is on the verge of a branding revamp and demands that Jack secure Al Pacino for the upcoming advertising campaign or they will cease all business with Jacks Company. Academy award winner Al Pacino does not do commercials! Meanwhile Jill visits Jack for the holidays and as usual is welcomed by the whole family except her own brother who find her disturbingly annoying. The story quite boringly rolls through until Jill happens to meet Al Pacino at a Lakers game and he falls in love with Jill head over heels. Adam Sandler is a talented Hollywood celebrity who isn't afraid of taking risk with his movies. Maybe that is because it is said that irrespective of the success rate of the movie he is guaranteed a 20 million dollar paycheck for his appearance in a lead role. How true that is I do not know. Even for Sandler JACK & JILL is an all-time new low. Being married to Hollywood's main man Tom Cruise did not save Katie Holmes from this disaster. The script was horrible and what's worse Katie's acting is equally on par. Long gone are the days of her cute smile wins the hearts of viewers like in DAWSONS CREEK. I am still a huge fan and I adore her work, but this is one of the hardest movies I have sat through this summer. The after taste of how bad it is still lingers at its memory.The only saving grace for JACK & JILL are the Nick Swardson appearances, he isn't all that great, but clearly if there is even one chuckle in the movie, it comes from him. It's surprising how Sandler didn't write one good line for him since the screen play is done by himself. The character of Jill can be assumed to have been the big comedy Dennis Dugan focused on. The joke ironically is on director Dugan himself. Sandler's portrayal of Jill is nothing but annoying, it isn't acting but more of shouting. In an attempt to differentiate the male from the female, Sandler stretches his voice a bit too much. Now I agree that there is a thin line between love and hate, JACK & JILL crosses that line! I simply loathe myself for wasting my time on even writing this down. Someone needs to warn you folks.This being said, JACK & JILL won 10 awards overall for this production. Surprising? Not at all!!!!!! For those of you who are not familiar of the Golden Raspberry Awards, it is ceremony held to honor the worst movies of the year. JACK & JILL along with the cast set a record breaking high of securing 10 awards early this April. Don't say I didn't warn you.TITLE: JACK & JILL DIRECTED BY: DENNIS DUGAN STARRING: ADAM SANDLER, KATIE HOLMES, NICK SWARDSON, David SPADE, ROHAN CHAND, ELODIE TOUGNE and AL PACINO RATED: PG RATING: 02/10 91 MINUTES",

It not that kind of humor, its pretty family friendly but man its hilarious to me...Adam is the latest Mel Brooks. I didn't actually think he was that funny as Jill but still there were so many funny moments. Adam will have to add dirty jokes, nudity, and lots of f bombs before he will get his audience back.

            "content": "\u00a8His twin sister is coming for the holidays\u0085and it ain't pretty.\u00a8Adam Sandler stars in yet another disastrous comedy this year, this time playing two characters: a male and female version of himself. This is just one of those movies Sandler could make with his eyes closed. It requires no dedication from him whatsoever and I don't blame him. Why try to change what you do when it is having results? It doesn't matter that the critics don't enjoy his films because the audience seems to keep on coming back for more. I find most of his films pretty much alike and haven't enjoyed one of them in a long time, but it doesn't matter because Sandler fans will continue to support his movies and fill theater seats. One thing is for sure, Sandler has a lot of fun at work. He probably has a blast making these easy movies which don't have anything memorable about them, but sometimes are enough for a few laughs. I think I enjoyed Just go With It a little more than this movie, but I really had a hard time deciding which film was worse. Director Dennis Dugan has worked many times with Sandler in the past beginning with Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, and ending with Grown Ups and Just Go With It. They seem to be making the same films over and over again and repeating the same jokes, but Sandler has his fan base and he stays true to them. I enjoyed his earlier films, but have stopped doing so in recent years. The jokes have gotten old and there are many other better comedies coming out these days. I wouldn't be surprised if this film actually wins every Razzie Award it's been nominated for, including Worst Picture.Jack Sadelstein (Adam Sandler) is a successful commercial producer who has a happy life alongside his wife, Erin (Katie Holmes), and two children, Sofia (Elodie Tougne) and Gary (Rohan Chand). They are expecting Jack's twin sister, Jill (Adam Sandler), annual visit for Thanksgiving. Jack doesn't get along with Jill very much although she thinks the best of him and misses the old days when they spent all day together. The truth is Jill is very loud and obnoxious and Jack enjoys his normal and quiet family life. What should have been only a weekend visit ends up being a long one since Jill feels lonely after her mother has passed away. She ends up staying and things get out of hand at times. In the meantime, Jack needs to sign Al Pacino (played by himself) for a commercial and so decides to try to convince him to accept the offer. Pacino ends up falling in love with Jill, but she wants nothing to do with him. Jack tries to use her in order to convince him to do the commercial but things begin to get out of hand. The film doesn't really have much of a plot as we have to sit down and see a Sandler double feature but that is pretty much all I can say about the plot synopsis. I don't see how anyone could actually enjoy this film, but I'm guessing most Sandler fans will like this considering they get to see two Sandler characters. The highlight of the films might be the special cameo appearances as we get to see Shaq, David Spade, Norm MacDonald, Dana Carvey, Regis Philbin, Dan Patrick, Drew Carey, John McEnroe, and Johnny Depp among many others. I don't know how Sandler gets all these people to show up in his movies but somehow he manages too. This may be Al Pacino's worst role to date, I guess he just wanted to try something new, but he looked absolutely ridiculous in this film. Katie Holmes was alright, she didn't have to do much, and her character wasn't funny so she just played a safe role. Eugenio Derbez was the best thing about the movie. His character, Felipe the gardener, was by far the funniest thing about Jack and Jill. There is not much more I can say about this, It is really a lazy comedy, but I can see how all these actors might have had such a fun time playing together and making easy money. I was tempted to stop watching this movie right after it started, but I decided to suck it up and stay to the end. My favorite scene was when Jill was working out in the cruise with the two beefed up men and making them look bad. I really laughed hard at that scene, probably because I was just too bored with the rest of this terrible movie.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",

The movie makes the big mistake of making the character of Jill not only obnoxious, but unfunny and without any exposure to a sympathetic side to her character. Jill is so grating and overbearing that you can't believe that Jack's wife and children think good of her. The movie is just Jill's obnoxiousness over and over, so much so that I think that even some die hard Adam Sandler fans will turn off their televisions before the end.

He tries to keep calm and have a nice relationship with her, but alas, she's just too much!\" His character was exactly the same type he has played for the last ten years and that's why I say Jill is actually a tiny bit likable. But even so I would not recommend this Adam Sandler show to anybody. Fart jokes, awful CG gags, distasteful jokes about Mexicans being gardeners and crossing the border (how is Hollywood still not sick of these? Do we still find it funny?), jokes about Jews, product placement, hysterical screaming.... Oh, Jhonny Depp makes a cameo for some reason... Not even a smile. I actually don't know how I stayed awake through this.",

Provided you have an actor/superstar who listens to his director, an actress/global celebrity who just glows on screen throughout the movie and if the big budget is totally justified.All the credit for this extravagant movie goes to Sandler. The man is an absolute genius. His creativity reaches great heights with this movie and elevates the American Hollywood movie standard to an all time high. With every movie of his, the scale of movie-making grows tremendously. He got the best technology money can buy. Looks like the majority of the budget is spent on Animatronics and this movie has got plenty of that.Sandler is magnificent in this movie. In fact, he is the movie. He adds life to every single frame created by Sandler. Sandler does what he does best, looking GORGEOUS.He has some pretty slick dance moves too but these go unfeatured in this particular blockbuster.The Animatronics are the best you could find in any movie so far and not just an American movie. The CGs are spectacular. Sandler shows the audience some of the best places in the world all for a few bucks. The locations are mind-blowing and totally unique to this movie. Sandler handpicked the locations for backdrops and they are shot on a grand scale. The music is haunting and highly entertaining.This movie will surely become one of the biggest movies ever made in the US and without a doubt bring in a lot of moolah to the producers, distributors and the exhibitors all around the world.Sandler redefines the fart gag.

            "content": "I recently wrote a review of God's Not Dead 1 and 2, admitting that I used to like them, but I realized over time how awful they are. Jack and Jill is another one of those movies.Now, let me make this clear- I never LOVED this movie. But I did find it alright. I regret this wholeheartedly now, and let me tell you why, after I give you the plot summary:In the movie, Adam Sandler plays Jack, a commercial director who's twin sister is coming home for Thanksgiving-but refuses to leave. The twin is also played by Sandler.There are so many problems with Jack and Jill that it's kind of hard to know where to start, but here we go:1. Adam Sandler playing a man and his sister? I don't mind cross dressing in movies-Eddie Murphy does this in The Nutty Professor movies and Norbit(Not a perfect movie by the way but still WAY better than this), and movies like Mrs. Doubtfire, Tootsie, and Some Like It Hot do this quite well, but Sandler just wasn't made for it.2. His voice for Jill is quite annoying, worse than his voice for The Waterboy. I dare you look up a clip of this movie and tolerate Jill's voice. Now consider hearing it for a majority of a 90-ish minute movie!3. There is SO much bathroom humor in this movie! There's literally a scene where Jill gets diarrhea on a date and at home she tells Jack about her horrible night in-between numerous farts and defecation sessions! In another scene, Baby Jill out-gasses Baby Jack in the bathtub!4. It's a pointless movie. What are we supposed to gain from it? Laughs? A Thanksgiving movie? If you want either of those, see Planes, Trains, and Automobiles or Dutch, both great works from John Hughes. But please don't see this!5. It's not that funny. There's a gag where Jill doesn't recall the name of It's A Wonderful Life, and it's predictable and not comedic. Fart jokes replace good jokes, and so much more. There's one decent joke where Jack dresses as Jill and his fake boobs are adjusted by a stranger but that scene doesn't amount to much in the end.6. And if all of this isn't bad enough- AL PACINO, the same one that starred in The Godfather and Scarface, plays himself and becomes a LOVE INTEREST for Jill! That makes me speechless!That's probably not every problem that this movie even has! How this was ever greenlit is beyond me.I actually like Adam Sanlder. I enjoy Anger Management, Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, Grown Ups, and a few others. This, however, should be collected and burned.If you are blessed to have never seen Jack and Jill, remain that way. At most, see it to mock with your friends. Otherwise, there's no need to see it at all! It would be preferable to fall down a hill with a bucket of water than see this headache of a \"movie\" ever again.Reverse Recommendations: If you want any good movie connected to this garbage, see any other great, good, or alright movie that I mentioned in the review, here they are again:The Nutty Professor, Norbit, Mrs. Doubtfire, Tootsie, Some Like It Hot, Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, Dutch, It's A Wonderful Life, The Godfather, Scarface, Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, Anger Management, or Grown Ups.These 14 movies are all better, if not perfect, uses of your time!",

I mean, there is no sex jokes that often are served to you by comedy films these days, but still some situations were just too much. And the Mexican jokes were too many on the edge of being racist. Now, the performances were bad also, mainly from the main duo. You kind of expect that there will be some good acting in the film, as there are so many big names performing, but somehow they managed to be as bad as the final result that they presented to us. Finally the film had no story line. Seemed to me that things happened randomly and they just somehow made the best of it. So 2 out of 10, because I watched a really bad TV movie before it and Shrek 2, a movie that I have watched a hundred times, after it and still they were better than this one.",

            "content": "Saw this film yesterday in a theater about half filled.I will not duplicate the many, many reviews here in detail. I believe I have a plausible answer for the people asking \"What was Adam Sandler thinking when he made this film?\" First, a short summary: Family man Jack's single, lonely, twin sister comes from New York City to greater Los Angeles to visit her brother and his family. Of course, both Jack and Jill are played by Adam Sandler. Although she smiles and says some nice things, she thoroughly annoys everyone at the Thanksgiving table with rude, hurtful comments. This first part of the movie is, I think, the worst, because they made her seem quite unlikable.I believe the notion was to quickly let the audience see why Jack really doesn't like her visits, why she drives him crazy.For the rest of the film, we see a twin sister who is sad, lonely, and who needs to feel wanted. She doesn't realize how dumb and wrong the things are that she says.One weakness in this movie is that Jack, other than having a bad temper, is a pretty normal guy and doesn't do a lot of funny things. It's like he is the straight man to \"Jill\". The character of Jack's wife is given, as I recall, nothing funny to add to the film at all. She was there, but wasn't annoying or funny or really, memorable.The main focus is on Jill, and her attempts to find a man through the computer, helped unknowingly by Jack's Craigslist ad directing people to her computer site. After a disaster of a first date, Jill winds up happening to meet Al Pacino, the actor, who her brother desperately wants for an ad campaign he is working on.There was a lot with Pacino, who was fascinated by Jill and wanted much to date her. Most of the best parts of the film involved Pacino's pursuit of Jill, and Jack's efforts to keep him happy so he'd make the commercial Jack needed done.I thought the character of Jill did enough likable things to make the audience want her to be happy.It wasn't the best comedy ever, but it was far, far from the worst. I thought there was one scene that should have been cut from about 3 minutes to 20 seconds and the film would have improved--the listening through the door to the bathroom scene referred to elsewhere on IMDb.So, to my thought, \"What was Adam Sandler thinking when he made this movie?\" I believe the correct answer is, \"Millions of people in theaters around the country will get a fair amount of laughs when watching.\" I can tell you that there were a lot of people, adults and children, laughing in the showing I attended, including my wife and myself. It was reasonably funny.",

It feels like it was written by a child. But even saying that would be an insult to children everywhere. This awful film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It's budget was a reputed $75m.

She's drives him crazy, and stays up until New Year's. Jack is an advertising executive and needs Al Pacino for his business. Soon, Al becomes obsessed with Jill and tries to get with her.

So, \"Jack and Jill\" stars Adam Sandler as Jack, a rich advertising executive, and Jill, his annoying and obnoxious twin sister (the female version of himself). She decides to stay with Jack for the holidays, but no matter what, she refuses to leave. Now, the torture has commenced. This is not only the worst movie of the previous year, but this is also the worst movie in Adam Sandler's life-time career. This is a surprisingly boring, painfully annoying, and incredibly tasteless, unfunny piece of junk that really tries it's best, really hard. For example, there's a Thanksgiving scene when there is so much dialogue coming out of people's mouths, that it's just not funny. They're repeating dialogue after dialogue, it's completely not funny, and you want them to just shut up. I'm just glad that the homeless person sitting at the Thanksgiving dinner in that scene was embarrassed to be a part of the stupidness, and left at the second. There is so many stupid scenes that involves characters getting hit either in the face or in their private areas, racism involving an obnoxious Indian child, fart jokes, 'crap their pants' jokes, and over-the-top complaining from an annoying twin sister. Who thought this stuff would be funny? Also, Katie Holmes is in the movie as Jack's wife. She's really cute, but she doesn't do anything. Another fine actor that looks embarrassed to be a part of this piece of garbage is Al Pacino playing...well...Al Pacino, who falls in love with Jill, because he thinks she's special. I don't know why! Jack wants Jill to date Al Pacino, so Al can be in Jack's \"Dunkin Donuts\" commercial. Oh, that's hilarious....not! Even if I chuckled at Pacino making references of his only Oscar being destroyed, and reciting old movie lines from his previous films, that didn't help save the movie, though! From the embarrassing cameos of such great actors, a script that's totally useless, to a cast that has no idea why this movie is being made, \"Jack and Jill\" is complete schlock from start to finish. You take a look at Adam Sandler's career, and see the other funnier movies that he has made in the past, such as \"Billy Madison\", \"Happy Gilmore\", \"The Waterboy\", and \"The Wedding Singer\", you start to wonder why the hell is Adam Sandler making such crappy movies these days. From the opening scenes to the end credits, this is one of the worst movies of this or any other decade, generation, or light-year from now. \"Jack and Jill\", in my review, \"Boring, tasteless, embarrassing, unfunny, and a giant piece of crap\".",

BUT Pacino proves he is the greatest screen actor by bringing credibility to this \"film\". It is awful BUT there are some great one liners and jokes. \"In\" jokes that are not now funny -and were probably not funny then? Sandler encourages \"Jewish\" \"jokery\" throughout - in the way that only certain people can? He plays his twin as slightly goofy AKA as \"retarded\" in the way that Sandler always does - and he is no Jerry Lewis is he? BUT, again that word, It DOES deliver laughs. If only he had found an actress to play the role of the twin sister then maybe this film could have delivered but you only see, even with the trickery: Sandler in drag, very odd. In fact with black face white face issues maybe someone playing a straight female as a man might be questionable - are there no cross dressing actors in Hollywood? This film made money and if you do watch it at Xmas, then watch it with the young kids and their old grannies, as they WILL giggle. A film not for those found in-between childhood or near death But Al Pacino walks it.",

            "content": "I'm a big Adam Sandler fan, but Jack & Jill was a mediocre effort. The film had some laughs (mostly captured in the trailers), but the movie was stalled by too many somber stretches with Jill (sister played by Adam Sandler) and the forced scenes with Al Pacino.Sandler's regular cast of sidekicks (his cross-eyed friend, the dumb guy, Rob Schneider, David Spade) filled the movie. They provided a few funny moments, but most of their scenes bombed or were pointless.The oddest role was Al Pacino playing a desperate Al Pacino. His scenes seemed to drag on with no purpose. The scenes were difficult to endure, as he tried to romance Jill (female Sandler).The movie had many, many celebrity cameos, which are fun to see and even better if they are funny or add to the movie. Johnny Depp & Shaq were two of the better cameos.Overall, the movie probably isn't worth a movie ticket. Jack & Jill is more of a Netflix rental down the road. Or, better yet, check out a funnier old school Sandler film like Happy Gilmore, or one of his better relationship films like 50 First Dates or Just Go With It.",

            "content": "I thought I had seen some pretty bad films in my time, but then I saw this one and I have to say that this one comes pretty close one of Sandler's worst. Mind you, I'm not alone in this if the number of Razzies that this film was nominated for is anything to go by, as well as the ratings that I have seen for this one on the various review sites as well. Yet, for some bizarre reason, this film still made money. It just seems that Sandler has this ability to make money no matter how bad the film happens to be, and this one was certainly right down there.The story is about this advertising executive (a Sandler trope - he always seems to play these rather wealthy Hollywood types in his later films) who has an identical twin sister (who is also played by Sandler, which is what actually really put me off the film). To say that his sister is annoying is a serious understatement, yet his kids seem to get on well with her, as well as his wife. She comes over to Los Angeles from New York to celebrate Thanksgiving, and then stays around for a while.The thing is that Sandler has to convince Al Pacino to do a commercial for Dunkin Donuts, otherwise they lose the contract, which will probably send the company bankrupt. Fortunately, at a basketball game, Pacino meets his sister and he falls in love with her, but she isn't all that keen on him. So, most of the film is about Sandler trying to hook up his sister with Pacino to get Pacino to do the donut add.They seem to suggest that Pacino has standards, but honestly, he played a major roll in this film, which makes me think that he doesn't. Honestly, I am even baffled as to why he even agreed to do this film, particularly since that he doesn't seem to be all that starved for roles, not in the way that Robert Deniro seems to be. Yet, here he is, playing a role that is definitely beneath him.Then again, there happens to be a lot of cameos in this film, but that is probably because Sandler does happen to have some pulling power, and as I suggested, he just seems to be able to have an ability to make money of a film no matter how bad people seem to think it is. Then again, I'm sure his luck is going to run out sometime, but it certainly didn't when it came to this film. Hey, I watched it, but then again I'm making my way through as many of his films as I can.",

Its strictly NOT meant for the pseudo intellectuals, who only have an appetite for Hardcore-Serious Cinema. I won't say I loved this comedy, but I definitely didn't hate it either. Come on, you're not meant to take this film seriously, its meant to make you laugh, that's it! Ben Zook, Steve Koren & Robert Smigel's Screenplay is over-the-top, but funny at times nevertheless. Dennis Dugan's Direction, is fair. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are functional.Pacino is truly Unforgettable in here. The Emperor of Acting delivers a load of laughs, thanks to his Fantastic Comic-Timing & Undeniably Screen-Presence. Sandler, on the other-hand, delivers a very relaxed & sporty performance. He's good as Jack & completely \"fun\" as Jill. Among other performances, Katie Holmes is her usual self. In cameo roles, Johnny Depp & Shaquille O'Neal are Superb.On the whole, 'Jack and Jill' is funny in parts. Watch it for Pacino & Sandler's Winning Performances.",

            "content": "The most surprising thing about the anti-comedic Jack and Jill was that I didn't hate it. The least surprising thing was that I didn't laugh.Much like a small town with an accused murderer everyone knows and it's tough for a jury not to have a set opinion if the trial doesn't change its venue, it would be even harder not to go into this movie without preconceived notions as this movie has been used as toilet paper by more critics than even Twilight. Still, I try my best to have an open mind and every movie has its fresh slate as it begins.Oh, don't get me wrong, by the end of the film \u2013 along with it's terrible bookended \"Twin\" coming out stories, as if twins are the new gays \u2013 I was not pleased either. It sure was awful and all jokes, if you can call them those, appeared to miss the mark by a six-hour flight. It was almost as if they started with the premise \"What if we can get Al Pacino play himself and ask the audience why he only has one Oscar\" and blindly wrote the script around that.The film had ancient ideas wrapped in clich\u00e9s and bad characters with even worse dialogue. I'm guessing here, and I think the obvious finale will back me up, we're supposed to care about the obnoxious and sad Jill, but it didn't happen. Make that nothing happened to make us care about anyone. Even Adam Sandler's Jack looked bored, confused and tired thorough.How could he possibly think this was a good idea? Or any of the dozens of cameos? And if I may, I can understand Al Pacino is doing everything (and any project) he can to stay in the limelight, but poor once-great Johnny Depp. I think Johnny just gave up. He said he's made his billions did enough fantastic projects and now will just stop all what made him grand once. (SEE: The Tourist and Pirates 3-4.)The basic plot, and yeah, it's flat-basic, is yearly visitor Jill overstays her unwelcome by her twin, Jack. But, wait! If Jack can get Jill to date Al Pacino, he'll star in a Dunkin Donuts ad and Jack won't lose his biggest client.This micro-thin Three's Company lost episode was sad before it began and it appears even Adam Sandler realized it. The puns were lazy, juvenile \u2013 and not in the typical Sandler fashion, I really mean a kid wrote them \u2013 and were never said with any conviction. And Al Pacino apparently was repeating his Colonel Frank Slade from Scent of a Woman if he would fall for Jill \u2013 she wasn't just obviously ugly outside, she was a beast inside, as well.Some movies are so bad they NEED to be seen, such as The Room, Birdemic: Shock and Terror or Troll 2. Mostly for curiosity reasons. After you read my 10-second plot synopsis, you need not spend another hour and half wasting your way through female Adam Sandler falling down or male Adam Sandler looking more indifferent and sad than frustrated.",

Having to spend time together over the holidays, it becomes a period of hardship for Jack.Story-wise, then \"Jack and Jill\" was alright, it didn't really bring anything new to the comedy genre, and it was all stuff that basically had been seen before in other movies.

            "content": "It could be argued that this movie is basically crap, and on many levels I could agree. The story is wafer thin, there are too many cameos of unknown entity's, etc etc etc.Adam Sandler in the UK is an actor whose films for the most part use to go straight to VHS or have limited runs at the cinema. I have been the only the person in screenings of The Wedding Singer, The Waterboy, Big Daddy and Little Nicky. The only film I can remember that he appeared in that was popular was Grown Ups and that was easily his worst film, I think people were drawn to the fact it was co starring Kevin James who was popular in Hitch.Look at the long list of lazy American comedians who just read scripts sent and accept the films for the dough paid up front. The foreign/overseas audience have no idea why Chevy Chase Bill Murray, Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy etc keep getting work, there names very rarely appear in the list of screenwriters attached to their projects. Adam Sandler at least writes or co-writes the majority of the films he appears which is the case for Jack and Jill. The first ten or so reviews that I have read state this film was not funny. This is where I have to disagree and say that the majority of those reviewers are pompous. Where this film fails with other reviewers is that he consistently and crassly hits the funny bone. There is a certain standard he reaches for and with this one succeeds. If you don't like Happy Madison productions avoid this film, if you found yourself laughing at a Happy Madison production in the past give Jack and Jill a try. The film is funny from the start to the end. Al Pacino is given a chance to play up to the public's preconceived idea of him and thankfully Sandler and Co follows a Ricky Gervais scenario quite well and leads the celebrity into an awkward scenario. There is good use of animals for cheap jokes, ethnicity is used to laugh at WASPS, Jews, Indians and Mexicans and all done with no spite or malice. The picnic scene and the repercussions are funny.The only thing wrong with this Adam Sandler production, is that the viewer knows a chunk of his earnings will endorse Republican causes in this election year",

Sometimes you watch a terrible movie and it's hilariously bad even laugh out loud funny because of how bad it is. This is not the case with Jack and Jill, it's without a doubt the worst movie I have seen in a long time. The movie stars Adam Sandler as twins Jack and Jill. I really don't know which performance I hated more. Adam Sandler acting as himself,unfunny as ever, or Adam Sandler acting obnoxious dressed in drag. Either way you look at it this movie is terrible. I couldn't even figure out what exactly the point of this movie even was. I guess to show how you should overcome how much you hate your annoying sibling or whatever. It doesn't matter because this movie is terrible in every single capacity. No jokes even spur a slight chuckle, in fact if anything the jokes in this movie made me angry because of how bad they were. The movie features supporting roles from Katie Holmes and Al Pacino. I can't help but feel bad for them for being in this movie but surprisingly enough Pacino seems to put effort into his role. But it doesn't matter because the movie is terrible. The movie also features David Spade in arguably the worst acting performance I have seen. He has a fight with Adam Sandler or something. I don't even know I wasn't paying much attention to the movie at this point. Everything bad you have heard about this movie is true.

            "content": "'JACK AND JILL': A Half a Star (Out of Five) Adam Sandler for the majority of his career (in which he's been the most bankable star in Hollywood, for the majority of it) has consistently made crappy movies (with the exception of a few good ones like 'FUNNY PEOPLE', 'PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE' or 'HAPPY GILMORE' here and there) and they seem to be only getting worse. He certainly has never reached as low as he has with this film and I hope he can't go any lower. The funniest thing about it though is his films all (including this one) are huge box-office hits (except for the good ones, like the ones I mentioned). They all make over a $100 million a piece and huge profits. He's only making the films that people want to see, is what's the most ridiculous thing about it. Which proves that people love crappy movies. They may say they don't (and make fun of movies like this) but they keep getting made because people love handing over their money to see them.In this one Adam Sandler plays identical twins Jack Sadelstein and Jill Sadelstein and the one joke premise revolves around the idea that Jack can't stand his annoying and grotesque sister when she comes to visit him and his family for the holidays each year. This time it turns in to an extended visit and Jack goes crazy trying to get rid of his sister. The craziest thing about the story is that Al Pacino plays himself as a crazed stalker who falls madly in love with Jill but Jill, despite always repelling men, isn't into the millionaire superstar. This drives Jack even crazier as he's been trying to secure a business deal with Mr. Pacino.The movie is insane! It's one of the most painful experiences I've ever had watching a movie. The premise of the movie, in one effect, works because we as viewers experience fully how crazy Jack is going by having to put up with Jill but it's never funny. It's just disgusting and annoying. Sandler used to be funny and this is what he's seriously trying to pass as comedy these days. Honestly I don't seriously think he believes it's funny though. He knows it's crap but he knows that's what people want. He is a genius comedian but even more so he's a genius businessman and that's why he's the biggest star in Hollywood. He knows how to make a money making hit every single time. He produced the movie, wrote it (if you can call it that) with his buddies Steve Koran and Ben Zook, cast a bunch of his friends in it and hired his director friend Dennis Dugan (who directs most of his films) to direct. He made the movie for $79 million by allowing himself and his friends to pocket most of the money and put almost no effort into making a quality film because he knew it wouldn't matter. The studio still made a huge profit and everyone involved is happy. It seems the biggest joke is on all the viewers who paid to go and see it; Sandler is messing with everyone and getting richer and richer in the process. That's a genius comedian!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioQaCI5Qk34",

I still don't understand why Al Pacino was in this movie, the man who was in Scarface acted in this crappy movie. It wasn't interesting or funny in anyway. This is probably a career ender for Adam Sandler. When Jack or Jill was supposedly saying a joke it would be a really bad one and that is the only reason people laughed. Why would you play both characters? It is still a mystery to me why someone like Katie Holmes would be in a rubbish movie like this. I do not recommend anyone to see this movie, save your money and go see some real comedy.",

            "content": "The ending of Jack and Jill has Al Pacino, played by none other than Al Pacino, telling Adam Sandler's character to burn every copy of the commercial he is filmed in. This may be a simple joke, or it may be Adam Sanlder letting the audience know that he is aware how bad this movie is. He may realize it was an excuse to spend over 90 million dollars on the movie to give some cash to his buddies and get some product placement in.In a way this may be Adam Sandler's masterpiece. He proposes the question whether all film is \"art\". Is a Pepto Bismol commercial art? This movie is at it's core a money-making mechanism. It effortlessly piles on the product placement revolving around Adam Sandler's character who is, you guessed it, in the advertising business.The movie's jokes include the usual fart and physical drivel that most poor comedies have. I enjoy this type of comedy sometimes, when it is done at the right time and situation (Dumb and Dumber is one of my favorite movies). Every joke in Jack and Jill falls completely flat. Punch lines are seen from a mile away and the viewer is left filling in the blanks before they appear on the screen.Another way to look at this movie is a \"so bad it's good movie\". I can think about it now and chuckle at how absurd some of the jokes trying to be told were. I laugh at how a ridiculous idea was actually turned into a movie. It almost seems as if Sandler knew he was going to be parodying himself when he produced this movie. The only reason I spared this movie a 1/10 is because of Al Pacino. I think I laughed twice during this movie and both were because of Al Pacino. One more thing to boost the rating to a 2/10 is the ending quote. It's as if the movie suddenly became self- aware when Al Pacino says \"Burn every copy of this.\". This last line makes you wonder just how Adam Sandler has been able to make $300 million by churning out movies like this one. The biggest surprise isn't that he managed to do it once, it's that he does it several times and it looks like he will be able to continue doing it into the future.I don't hate Adam Sanlder, I like Happy Gilmore and Anger Management to an extent. I just find it fascinating that he is able to make millions while so easily making a terrible \"movie\". The box office proves Sandler does indeed have an audience, so can you really blame him for making stuff like Jack and Jill?",

I didn't think that an idea this stupid could actually be real! So, the plot is that Jack's sister Jill is coming over for Thanksgiving. It's sad that there are so few Thanksgiving movies out there and this is one of the most well known. Anyway, Jack needs to get Al Pacino to do a Dunkin Donuts commercial for him.As you might have guessed, Pacino falls in love with Jill. It's mostly because they both grew up in the Bronx. This is a pretty stupid reason to fall in love seeing as how Jill is ugly and annoying. We get even more hideous and embarrassing makeup throughout the film with David Spade as a woman and some old Mexican woman with one tooth who eats peppers. Jack has an adopted Indian son who likes taping things to his chest. This is stupid and pointless, much like the entire film.In fact, the kid characters serve no purpose at all. We have to deal with Sandler's annoying voice as Jill throughout the whole film. Of course there's a lot of farts in this movie! Oh, and Jill pooping Mexican food. I think the only reason this didn't get a PG-13 rating is because there were no swear words in it. This won more Razzies than any film in history and while it's not as awful as \"Daddy Day Camp\" or \"The Master Of Disguise\", it's still horrendous. *",

Adam Sandler seems to have finally broken any connection with reality and positive criticism from his peers, and keeps on making supposedly funny movies when, in fact, all the fun has gone out of him. This ego trip that generates breaking the basic rule of comedies with guys in drag, rule that states that the audience is in on the joke, some of the characters in the movie are not, thus it creates a funny setup, is not observed by Sandler who is utterly unconvincing as a female character, being obviously Adam Sandler, and when the audience realizes that both the characters in the movie as well as the audience itself are the dumb ones that don't realize this character is obviously a guy in drag, then you get this extremely unpleasant vibe. What i felt bad about is that a couple of great actors joined this project, based, probably, on Sandler's reputation of creating those kind-of-stupid but funny movies.

Seriously all his movies are just nerdy and this time he is playing a double role of his \"twin sister\".It's a shame that someone dragged in Al Pachino into this dumb and dull movie - such a great actor has really sunk low in his old days. Why on earth does he waste his time on such crap? Then we have loser #3; Katie Holmes. She is probably still trying to convince her husband that she still can act. Cute as she is, she does not need to waste her time in Hollywood with Tom's millions of dollars that he is throwing around. She should stay home and raise the kids. That Tom Cruise is still flushing out money to the Scientology sect is just a shame. One day he will wake up and find out that he wasted half his life and millions of dollars to support the cult leader David Miscavige who is living a luxury life on his accounts.Katie!

Critics and movie-goers alike know what kind of comedy he produces, and know this going into each and every single new film that comes out, yet they feign surprise and disappointment at each new turn, acting as if they thought it was going to be some \"Oscar worthy performance\". Apparently, you're not allowed to make low-brow, silly comedies for the simple purpose of BEING silly and just a simple laugh, and apparently it's even worse if you make such movies and they are financial successes as Sandler's tend to be.Granted, I myself have felt that in the last few years, Sandler's films haven't been as funny. You Don't Mess With the Zohan was just weird, and while Just Go With It was alright, it wasn't hilarious either. Grown Ups, which with it's SNL Reunion cast, SHOULD have been hilarious, but it only provided a few chuckles, because in this man's opinion they played it too safe. They tried to go for a family comedy, when it should have been classic SNL type material. Click, in my estimation, was his last really strong comedy, and it worked successfully in the silliness AND \"drama\" departments.Having said that though, I just went to see Jack and Jill last night, and you know what? It was pretty damn funny. I'm not afraid to say I liked it, nor to admit that I laughed quite a bit at this \"low-brow, juvenile humored film\". I have been a fan of Sandler's work since his SNL days, and with very few exceptions, I've liked the majority of his output. But this film reminded me much more of the purely rampant silliness that his best movies are known for. It doesn't try to be anything more than what it is, unlike something like, say, Funny People, which quite frankly, wasn't. Jack and Jill is what it is: a silly and ridiculous comedy, with that patented Sandler spin on it.Adam Sandler is one of those figures that you either like or you don't. That's fine. So is Al Pachino, who quite frankly turned in a surprising and heartfelt performance. He wasn't afraid to act silly, and he honestly looked like he was enjoying himself making this, not just that \"he needed the money\". Perhaps if more people untightened their sphincters just a bit, and quit trying so hard to be overly-pretentious, overly cynical wanna-be movie critics, they'd grow up a bit and realize that you can, in fact, just go to a movie to relax and enjoy yourself, and not have to be viewing everything with a critical eye 24/7.If you go to a comedy like this expecting some life changing, Coen-Brothers level of acting or cinematography, you're a moron. Just the same as if you have ever gone into a Jet Li or Jackie Chan film expecting anything more than some awesome martial arts moves. Judd Apatow/Seth Rogan style comedies are honestly no less silly, outlandish, or straight up stupid than Sandler films, yet because they're rated R and feature copious amounts of \"party humor\", as opposed to \"potty humor\", they get more critical acclaim. Fact is (for the most part), they're both funny. You just have to be mature enough to drop your facade, lighten up a little, and laugh along with the stupidity. That's what comedies are for.

Katie Holmes is reasonably fit, I mean she's no 9 or 10 but she's at least a 7 and a half so she can't have been sleeping with Sandler, maybe she was emotionally distraught after not getting in the latest Danny Dyer film as well.

He's trying to get Al Pacino (played by himself) for a hilarious commercial you just have to see. His lonely, stereotypical middle-aged Bronx Jewish sister Jill has no family where she lives so she comes for an extended visit that begins with Thanksgiving and goes into the New Year. Jack and Jill tolerate each other, and Jill tries to find love through online dating, leading to good old Norm MacDonald appearing. Yet, Al Pacino falls in love with Jill and asks Jack to get her to date him. They go on a cruise, and it ends like most Adam Sandler movies.The jokes are highly juvenile (expected from a PG-rated Adam Sandler movie), yet you still want to laugh at them. There's many cameos that I honestly didn't expect, including one from a major superstar. I recommend it as a good movie to show your kids to get them into Adam Sandler, maybe after Bedtime Stories. It has some inappropriateness, mainly suggestiveness due to the cross-dressing, and Al Pacino.Overall, I recommend it as a nice matin\u00e9e, or a Redbox rental, if you want a good chuckle.

If you were one of these people, that presumed the same as me, then you were correct.Early on in the film Jack Sadelstein (Adam Sandler) says that Al Pacino would never stoop as low as to star in a doughnut advert to promote a Dunkaccino. This for me was the funniest moment of the film as it was ironic that Pacino wouldn't stoop as low as a cheesy TV ad, but would actually stoop lower and star as himself in another dated and terrible Adam Sandler film. The plot in this film is very basic and follows the classic cause and effect narrative structure, like most comedies do.Not only does Pacino sell himself out by appearing in this film, but he also sells out every other film he has ever made by rapping some of his most famous quotes from films like The Godfather Part II (Dir. Francis Ford Coppola, 1974) and Scarface (Dir. Brian De Palma, 1983) for the Dunkaccino TV advert.Many of the gags in Jack and Jill are slapstick orientated, which is rarely funny in the best of films; especially when it is overused, which it was. Jack's twin sister Jill (Adam Sandler) would fall over so many times, expecting the audience to laugh because a man dressed as a woman tripped up or lifted up weights that even body builders couldn't. However slapstick gags were not the only form of comedy within Jack and Jill. I was also able to experience the \"joy\" of hundreds of fart jokes, which might appeal to the 10 year old target audience, but not to adults. Finally I was disgusted at the amount of Jewish jokes Sandler had incorporated into the film. I don't think anyone laughs at those jokes unless they are actually Jewish, and even then I couldn't be certain. The comedy aspects of the script felt like they were written ten to fifteen years ago and Sandler just thought we have the same expectations for comedy in 2012 as we did then. We don't. Al Pacino is not the only star that appears as himself in Jack and Jill. Johnny Depp was also there with Pacino at a basketball game, and unusually Johnny Depp was probably the funniest part of the film. I will say that this film is seemingly aimed at American audiences rather than a British audience as Jack and Jill does have a lot of US celebrities that are unknown to me, and so the jokes they are involved in were just not funny.I did smile a few times during Jack and Jill but I never laughed out loud, which I would expect to do when watching a comedy film. Unfortunately half the gags I may have laughed at are in the trailer and therefore are no longer funny when seeing them for a second or third time. For a film in the comedy genre, it failed. For a film in general, it failed. Do not watch this unless you love every movie Adam Sandler makes. If you do then this film is probably right up your street with its unintelligent comedy, pathetic attempts for a laugh and tedious narrative. I will leave this review with the simple question of: How does Adam Sandler always get such attractive wives in his movies, when he just isn't that funny?If you enjoyed this review check out others on my blog: http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/",

            "content": "I have read many reviews of this movie that range from 0 to 2 out of 5 stars, and all of them seem to object to basically the same elements: the premise is silly, the jokes are juvenile, and the story predictable. Oh, and there is a lot of product placement. Well, I saw this movie with my two tween girls, and they laughed themselves silly. Yes, the humor was slapstick and silly, just like most Adam Sandler movies. Yes, the premise is ridiculous, since identical twins (those with \"twin powers\" can't be different sexes. Yes, it is crazy to think the Al Pacino would be interested in Adam Sandler in drag and perform a rap in a donut commercial (\"Burn this. This must never be seen\" - very funny scene). If you thought you were coming to see high art, you must have missed the trailers (or the movie poster). There were some laugh-out-loud moments, and there were some underwhelming attempts at low-brow humor that did not even make my kids laugh. Overall, however, I think tweens and early teens would like it. I did not quite understand Sandler's annoyance at his sister - most of the sibling rivalry must have taken place before the movie. Most of the movie, the male twin just seems to be self serving and mean. However, the New Year's party seen did seem genuine and sweet (even though he is being sweet to himself, which is a lot of disbelief to suspend). Anyway, it's not going to win any Oscars, but those who are saying it is the worst movie every made have obviously not seen the remake of Conan.",

            "content": "Okay, let me just clarify, this movie is NOT a perfect comedy. It's just a stupid, stupid movie. It's not 'The Artist', but what it is, is hilarious. I loved this film. It was great, it had its share of good moments and its bad moments, and I'm going to tell you them NOW!PROS: First of all, in my opinion, it's an improvement from 'Just Go With It', it has funnier jokes (and there are plenty, but there are 1 or 2 that are a hit or a miss) Adam Sandler is funny AND likable as Jill, even if she is very annoying, but I think that was the whole point of her character, as Jack, he's just the same old wealthy Adam Sandler character we've seen dozens of times in his other films, but is still likable, even though when he's not supposed to be likable. Katie Holmes as Jack's wife Erin was sweet in the film and really likable, she's also smokin' hot and actually does a pretty good acting job for a film like this, she acts concerned, angry, upset and happy when she needs to and is also quite funny, too! The children were funny also, but they weren't featured too much in the film so I'll leave it at that. We get the small cameos from the Sandler regulars, David Spade, Peter Dante, Jonathan Loughran, the director Dennis Dugan, Allen Cover, and John McEnroe and Nick Swardson, and they were ALL funny, but the best part of the film HAS to be Al Pacino, I don't know why he doesn't do more comedies, he was hilarious in this film. The way he plays himself is so good, it's as if he lost his brain and just wondered onto the set so Adam Sandler said; 'Okay! He's in the movie!' He was easily the funniest part about the movie and I think he should actually do more comedies. I can't really say much about the story, it's just a family reunion caught on tape with the Al Pacino thing on the side, but it does all fit in.CONS: Like my other reviews, there's only a few small problems with the movie, there's only a few jokes that I didn't like. And that's it.To summarise, I don't see what's so bad about it, it's not as awful as everybody else is making it out to be, it's just a silly film to watch and laugh at, and that's what I did! It's not THAT bad, in fact, the film is quite sweet, it makes you feel good after watching it. When I mean sweet, I mean Adam Sandler has this brilliant ability to create these stupid movies that don't look very appealing, but once you open up your mind and actually watch it, you end up liking it and actually liking the characters and some of the sweet moments incorporated into the film. It's a sweet,feel good comedy film where you can have fun, and that's what film-goers need to start doing, just have FUN and stop nit- picking!'JACK AND JILL'Directed by: Dennis DuganStarring: Adam Sandler, Katie Holmes and Al Pacino",

Although out of all these movies, Jack And Jill is by far the worst. For starters why did Sandler have to make Jill have the most annoying voice ever? It sounds like someone is dragging their nails down a chalk board, I know he was trying to go way over the top with Jill but come on, really? Also, how could you take a massive cameo from an amazing actor such as Al Pacino, use that cameo for most of the film and make a complete mess of it? Don't even get me started on the attempts at comedy, the only time I laughed was with joy when he was with joy when the film was over! Moral of the story: don't watch this movie... unless you enjoy having a week-long headache afterwards.",

It was loud, obnoxious, and a waste of time. I think the problem is Adam playing is twin sister. I could not stand that screechy character at all! I'm disappointed because I really liked his other 2011 effort, Just Go With It.Dennis Dugan's film is about a guy named Jack, who is a very good advertising executive. Unfortunately for him, he has to deal with his annoying twin sister for the holidays and get Al Pacino to appear in a commercial. Will her survive? I don't understand how the great Al Pacino would fall for this tripe. He is a screen legend and should know better. That being said, he did deliver a strong performance. Adam Sandler, though tolerable as his manly self, was completely awful as Jill. He should not have done Jill the way he did because I never met such an annoying character.Overall, this is the worst Adam Sandler movie I have seen to date. It was not funny and I spent the majority of the movie cringing whenever Jill was on screen. I guess the kids will enjoy this, but everyone else will find this torture. My \"high\" rating is due to the saving grace of Al Pacino. I rate this film 4/10.",

This film doesn't take itself seriously, but you can tell that a lot of hard work and thought has been put into it.

Thats it.But thanks to Pacino, the film is one of those wondrous creations like The Room, or Troll 2, which are awful, but have so much longevity about them, they demand to be watched.Pacino is extraordinary in this, and if it was just a normal actor playing a character, it would be one of the worst movie ever made.The film becomes funny whenever Pacino is on screen, because Pacino knows how to be self deprecating and he knows how to overact.Sandler doesn't overdo the Pacino bit though, but doesn't focus on the rest of the film sadly. The rest is devoid of humour, but not atrocious stuff, because you can watch it in awe.Depp gets asked if he was in Duran Duran and he says yes, and admittedly, the last three minutes are the funniest thing i've seen all year.Maybe Pacino and Sandler were watching a rough cut of this movie when Pacino says 'this must never be seen'.Thanks to you guys who have lambasted this movie on IMDb, this will becomes Sandlers cult movie, the movie people will be watching in years to come.Egg on your face for the haters, I think they bumped the box office up...",

Sadly Sandler is not really pulling it off too well in this film and for that reason among many others this film is bad. It's plot was pretty thin but yes there was some plot that tried to put it together even if done badly. It managed to have some funny moments with Al Pacino's cameo and Jill being so absurd.

And we're talking about some really messy phony message ... I wonder though how many boys/men will refer to this in the future as the beginning of a beautiful relationship ... to womens clothing!",

            "content": "Yes, I said it. Jack and Jill is not that bad. It does have a lot of dumb humor, but that what makes it funny. Yes, it does look a lot like a movie George Simmons (Adam Sandler's character from Funny People) would do. But, the reason why Sandler does films like this is because they make a lot of money, and when he does something different, those films don't do so well financially.Sandler stars in both title roles. Jack is a television commercial director-producer, who dreads when his twin sister, Jill, visits for Thanksgiving every year. Jack has only a few weeks to land Al Pacino to do a commercial for Dunkin Donuts when Jill arrives. Jack now has to keep his cool knowing that Jill is not just staying through Thanksgiving, but even longer than that.Sandler proves that he still is a funny guy in playing both parts. As Jack, Sandler has to play it straight and does good at playing the guy who has to keep his cool, yet loses it a few times. As Jill, he goes all out, especially with the ridiculous voice. Katie Holmes plays Jack's wife, Erin. She does okay with an underwritten part, but shows that she is not a great actress at all.Al Pacino is a riot as he appears in the film as himself. He made a character out of himself as a guy who wants Jill, yet trying to stay professional as an actor.Sandler fans, like myself, will enjoy seeing people such as Nick Swardson, Tim Meadows, Norm MacDonald, and David Spade appear in small roles. There are also cameos by Regis Philbin, Jared Fogle (Subway guy), and even Johnny Depp.Something I found to be somewhat entertaining, yet unnecessary was in the beginning and end of the movies where quite a few sets of twins talk about being a twin and what it's like.Fans of traditional Adam Sandler movies may find it entertaining, yet dumb. But that is what Adam Sandler movies are, and they still work.",

It has an ensemble of famous people such as Al Pacino and and John McEnroe. Full of childish potty humour and adult laughter, did this film seriously deserve to win every category in the Razzies? No. Believe me. It ISN'T that bad. Okay let me say it again. It isn't that bad at all. It's only critics and the Razzie awards going over their heads over awfulness. It's just a typical Adam Sandler film. Ignore the reviews and watch it with your family because believe me, nothing is wrong with this movie (except for the continuity errors).",

Jill, his twin sister, has looked after their mother in The Bronx until Mom's recent death. She comes to stay with Jack for her annual holiday: unfortunately, while Jill thinks the world of Jack, she rubs him up the wrong way and they always fight. Add in to this that Jack needs to persuade Al Pacino to do a cheesy commercial for Dunkin' Donuts, and that Al Pacino forms an attachment with Jill due to their shared Bronx background...... oh, and that both Jack and Jill are played by Adam Sandler...My habit is to come clean about reservations I have before seeing a film, and Adam Sandler is one of those. I do believe that the man has some ability as a performer, it just seems that I mostly dislike what he does: he leans heavily towards the crass, the ugly, the crude and the sentimental. Yet I recognise that his offerings find a market.Watching this film in a movie theatre with a moderate audience was an education. The film starts with a selection of twins giving on-camera interviews, and that section is quirky and entertaining. Then we meet Jack and discover how unpleasant he is. Then Jack meets Jill at the airport and we discover why she drives him up the wall (these sections seemed to amuse the young element of the audience: I sat there stony faced, and marvelled at the product placement). Then there is some schtick and they quarrel. Then there is some schtick and they quarrel. Then there is some schtick and they quarrel. At some point Al Pacino gets sucked into it. At one point Sandler is in drag playing himself as a man in drag imitating himself as a female in drag. There is (surprise surprise) a sentimental feelgood ending.I would have thought that this film was completely horrible had there not been a few things which redeemed it slightly. One is that there was no bad language - it is, I think, aimed at families although I doubt whether I personally would regard it as a suitable family film. Two, it was good to see Al Pacino slumming it and happily ripping into his established screen persona. Three, the effects which placed two Sandlers on screen at the same time were well done. Four, a fart sequence proved to be reliably funny. And, five. there were some laughs elsewhere. These usually arose from little quirky touches, like Sandler's adopted son of Indian origin who, for no apparent reason, tapes things - including small animals - to his body. That made me chuckle: little else did, and even the laughter in the cinema didn't last beyond the first half hour.Oh, and after this and the forgettable \"horror\" she was in a few months ago, Katie Holmes needs to rethink her comeback game plan.",

            "content": "The best thing about this movie? Without a doubt, it's Al Pacino! Doing a single-handed job in rescuing this disaster. I thus increased my rating of the movie, from 3-or-4 out of 10, to 6 out of 10, as without 'El Pacino' this film would have sunk to the bottom of a disastrous films list.However, as Al Pacino only made the film watchable by playing himself, rather than acting (i.e. playing a true \"character\") in fact it is questionable whether his role in this film can be said to have improved it. Playing oneself is, really, just cheating on the part of the film-makers! ,-) As A.P.'s casting in this film just serves to detract from the Adam Sandler characters of \"Jack\" & \"Jill\", does it really form part of the storyline at all?! Thus, although A.P. rescues the film from total failure, does he really! do so?! [ All that's a bit of a metaphysical - wink-wink! - observation regarding What Is A Film, but it is worth bearing in mind! LOL! ,-) ] Especially as Al Pacino is SUCH a famous actor - and held in such respect in the acting world, with gravitas aplenty - that his casting in this film meant he simply took the viewers' attention away from the \"Jack\" & \"Jill\" storyline. Instead of being memorable for Adam Sandler dressed in drag as his sister \"Jill\", A.P.'s casting in this film 'steals' the limelight. He creates a totally watchable send-up of The Famous Actor Al Pacino by the man who in no doubt has to be the best possible person to carry out such a parody: Pacino himself! LOL! I have always wanted to see A.P. play Shakespeare - though this is sadly not likely, as I am over in the UK not in Pacino's homeland - but have finally had the opportunity to see at least a vignette into A.P.'s interpretation of Shakespeare's King Richard III. A.P. is so well known for his love of the Bard. So what was even more delightfully self-effacing of the famous actor was to see such a great artist willing to send himself up, parading around on the theatre stage, dressed in full Shakespearean garb, declaiming the famous lines with a wittily & wickedly 'overdone' style. And, yes, he even quotes from his adulated 'Godfather' movies!! And as for the best scene in this film: watch A.P. (yes, yet again he saves the movie!) when - at the time mid-performance onstage & in full Shakespeare flow - he turns the table on the audience: his mobile phone rings mid-scene as he has left it switched on, and he then has the gall to answer the call at length! With no regard to the other stage actors - or the audience - he chats on at full voice while the paying audience have to wait! LOL! It must make every stage performer laugh out loud, and applaud, to see the tables turned on those theatre- & filmgoers who inconsiderately take calls in the middle of a performance. A humorous barb adroitly done by the great Pacino! ,-) At least the writers, production team, etc. CAN claim credit for these clever ideas, in-jokes, and lampoonery. As a film is of course the result of a team! of creators, not just one person.And Sandler is in all truth not bad in parts of this movie. At first sighting of \"Jill\" and the ensuing interaction between the 2 Sandler characters, yes, the awfulness of the film and the synergy of Sandler's 2 roles just made me cringe; but halfway through the film I realised I had changed this point of view. Without realising it had happened, I was now believing in \"Jill\" as both a woman and as a person in her own right: a crass, unpolished but somehow forgivable human being. And as the ability to make an audience suspend their disbelief is the essence of what a good actor should be able to do, Sandler deserves credit for that effect at least.... One last word: don't miss a tiny but superb cameo, at the end of the movie, by David Spade!",

I am an avid fan of B movies but this one doesn't even deserve to be treated as a \"so bad it's good\" kind of movie.

It's like Sandler took a dump on the script and said \"write.\" Al Pachino's mildly homosexual performance didn't even make me smile. I've seen better movies on YouTube. If you are a fan of Sandler, this is a major pass. Disappointing and truly stupid, this movie puts stupid comedies to shame. Adam Sandler tries way too hard to be funny and truly fails.

I'll admit that I haven't seen a Sandler movie in a very long time. I grew up watching stuff like BILLY MADISON and BULLETPROOF but I don't think I've seen any of his previous dozen films. Why watch this one? Two reasons really. One was its reputation of being one of the worst movies ever made. The second reason was to see what Al Pacino was doing in a film like this. For starters, I really don't think this is one of the worst movies ever made. It's a very stupid one but then again so are most of the films that Sandler does. The entire Jill character is annoying, poorly written and Sandler really doesn't do anything to make her human, which then makes the fake tears at the end all the more pathetic. The screenplay has nothing going for it and it's so poorly written that you can't help but sit there amazed that no one in the cast questioned what they were doing. With that said, the film did make me laugh at spots. Some of the humor is just so stupid that I couldn't help but crack a smile. Sometimes the humor is so weird that I cracked a smile. I thought the non-stop cameos from famous people were also funny. I mean, we get Johnny Depp appearing here?!? Dana Carvey, Norm MacDonald, Tim Meadows, Regis Philbin, Shaq, Drew Carey, John McEnroe and countless other celebs all agreed to be in this thing. Then, there's Al Pacino. Yes, I'm sure the main reason for doing this project was money but the man has done so many great movies he has the right to do what he wants. With that said, he actually goes all out and I must admit that it was fun watching him go so crazy. He seems to be having a blast with the performance and his spoofing of Shakespeare was pretty good. Again, JACK AND JILL is a bad movie. There's no way around it but at the same time I really didn't come into it expecting something good. I pretty much walked away with what I was expecting and that's silly Sandler doing silly stuff. The bonus was Pacino.",

Now THAT is something worth seeing. Sandler is even funnier playing Jack playing Jill than he is just playing Jill.Al Pacino gives a worthwhile and very funny performance as an exaggerated version of himself. I especially like the two scenes where he is in a Shakespeare play onstage and gets interrupted by a cell phone. The second time is even funnier because it is HIS cell phone but the audience reaction is just plain hilarious because the situation is so silly.Felipe the gardener is a somewhat likable character but \"I'm kidding!\" gets old after about the second or third time. One of the more enjoyable scenes is at a party where Jill spends time with his family. It's not all that funny but the music is good and everyone is just having a good time.

The film try's to be something more than it is creating awkward and very stupid situations throughout the film. Al Pacino stars as himself and some of the parts he is in made me smile, and that was about it. But the movie is just unfunny, providing lame jokes, slapstick comedy which only really works if used properly. If i was you, i will completely avoid this one. I walked out of the cinema and vomited in the trash outside and it still was not as disgustingly painful as having to watch this absolute garbage.If Adam Sandler doesn't come up with something, i will just give up on him forever.",

I have liked almost all of Sandler's movies and I think he gets a bad rap for some of the things he does (much like Eddie Murphy), but I'm sorry Sandler...I can't back you up on this one. This one is almost as bad as what you have heard about it. There are a few parts that made me laugh, but when the best part is a little kid taping animals to his back that shows you what kind of movie this is. On a side note Al Pacino is my favorite actor of all time, but the last scene with him made me cringe...watch it and you will see what I mean. The only reason I kept watching was because of Pacino, but that scene almost made me regret it. Overall, a movie I can't really recommend...\"Just Go With It\" was much, much better. I give it a C-. It's only that high really because Pacino used a line from the \"Godfather\".",

But I had to think about those films that I had watched because 'others' wanted to see them and I was forced to watch to maintain healthy relations with the rest of my family. Strangely my wife seemed to go through a period of believing in the talent of Adam Sandler - strangely, because I have watched several of his efforts and have yet to recall even getting a smile out of this dolt, but then she has a habit of not understanding the concept of humour and, despite watching both apparent 'funnymen' Sandler and Will Ferrell attempts, does seem to come away very disappointed. The funniest thing about this film was that it got made at all. Does nobody actually read Sandler's scripts or have the guts to ask him if he knows 'funny', or needs it explained to him? Seriously, had I watched this at a cinema I would have led a crowd back to the box office with flaming torches to demand our money back; luckily it was on TV, but it still rankles. \nAll involved deserve to never work again. \n0 out of anything - although I appear to have rated it one star?",

There are some films that can get by because it falls into a certain category such as a bad horror movie can be good because its bad. Adam Sandler has fallen into this category as of late the phrase \"Its bad but its Sandler.\" is used more than often to describe his movies but I promise you this is just as bad as everyone has said. Sandler plays duel roles as Jack and Jill twin siblings which is a excuse for Sandler to dress in drag and do his high pitch Jewish voice, that's the joke and it goes on for about 90 dull minuets.Jack is a rich guy working in advertising and his new goal is to land Al Pacino in a coffee commercial (who turns in the only funny moments in the film) His twin sister Jill comes to visit for the holidays and she is the most annoying person in the world. She is disgusting and knows nothing about the modern world, she proceeds to pick a fight with about every character in the film and then begins to cry after she does it, this goes on for the whole movie. I honestly don't understand this plot. Jack is played like a job obsessed jerk but he does everything to make his family happy. He takes Jill around so she can complete her to do list, setting her up on dates and letting her extend her stay longer and longer because you guessed it Al Pacino has fallen in love with Jill but she wants nothing to do with him but its the only way Jack can land him for his commercial.There is no redeeming quality to this film and the only amusing parts come not from Sandler but the multiple celebrity cameos like Johnny Depp and Shaq. The first thirty minuets of the film contains so many jump cuts to different scenes that I thought something was wrong with the movie, conversations seem to end in the middle and we just move on to the next.I watched this movie with my 14 year old twin nieces and there 8 year old sister, no one laughed. After awhile the older ones stuck there heads in there Ipads and zoned out for the rest of the film leaving me to watch the rest.There is a reason this won so many Razzies and it deserved everyone of them.

I've been a big Adam Sandler fan for a long time, and I was really looking forward to see his newest film when I first heard about it, but what a load of crap. I don't know even where to begin to describe the faults with this \"movie\". Sandler has managed to somehow kill everything that should have worked for this film. I mean, he has Al Pacino in it FFS, and he has managed to turn the Godfather into a whiny, boring weirdo. You get the impression from very early on that Al Pacino didn't want to be there, and the only reason he agreed to do it is because he either lost a bet or is in really bad need of a pay check. It's nice to see Sandler brought his usual crew with him, but they were all added as a side thought after he wrote a film that he could be on screen in for the entire 90 minutes that it dragged on for. Both characters he plays are awful to watch and a pain to listen to as he seems to think he has to be screaming to try and get a chuckle from the audience. The whole trailer can be seen in the first 15 minutes of the film, and that never bodes well for the rest of a movie. Katie Holmes seems to be the only actor who enjoyed being there and you never get to feel a connection with her as anytime she has a line either version of Sandler jumps in and kills the moment. The only characters that deserve a chuckle are the son and the bird, and even they only get a chuckle because of how awful everything else that's happening is. To sum up, if you want a laugh while watching Adam Sandler, watch ANY of his other films, because this one SUCKS!!!",

When I initially saw the trailers for this movie in theaters, I questioned why it was made because it just didn't seem to be believable. Now granted, Al Pacino was great as always and he delivered his lines with the professionalism that he dedicates to every project. However, not even Pacino could save this poorly written, ill-conceived, sad piece of drivel that permanently left a black stain on the Sandler franchise which will never be erased or forgotten.Jack and Jill was lacking in imagination, creativity, humor, spontaneity, and any form of enjoyment that could even remotely entertain the viewer. Accordingly, I'm not sure why one of his friends that he repeatedly casts in his projects didn't quietly pull Adam aside and politely tell him that this movie was shite! With the exception of Sandler himself, it was clear from the promotional interviews that all of those that acted in this movie were aware that it lacked to ability to be a breakout box office success. That just goes to show that his friends are willing to appear in anything Sandler writes, as long as it results in a financial bonanza for them. But if they would have been true friends, they would have told him just exactly how outrageous, flat, and disjointed this movie was w/ the exception of Al Pacino. Jack and Jill clearly shouldn't have been greenlit by the studio since most of us could tell from the outset that it was an outrage! It ranks up there with other epic classics that failed at the box-office miserably including: Howard the Duck; Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000; Waterworld; John Carter; and Death to Smoochy. After seeing the movie trailer I decided to wait until this movie aired on cable to watch it, and that's exactly what I did because I was unwilling to invest any extra finances on it via Redbox or Netflix, and I certainly wasn't going to pay the price of a movie ticket to view it.I hope that Sandler has taken time to reflect on this film failure in order to learn a valuable lesson about writing more enjoyable future films. Also, let's hope that the movie studios will stop green-lighting disappointing movie scripts like this one. After all, people criticize Tyler Perry for his Madea character which they call annoying in some cases, but at least Mr. Perry makes profit with his movies because they are entertaining. Lately Adam Sandler's movies have become a disappointing means to a paycheck! And I hope that getting paid is not what's motivating him to write lately, or it just emphasizes just how sad the entertainment industry has become as an industry!!!!!!!",

It's like they went ahead and shot this movie before there even was a script ready. It's weird and it makes the movie feel like such an incomplete one.But other than that, is the humor more lame or childish when compared to other similar genre movies? And is the Jill character really more obnoxious, irritating and unconvincing than any other forced comedy characters? Not really. As a matter of fact, the movie its humor and characters didn't bother me all that much. It's a comedy, so of course everything is being over-the-top. When you go along with that, it's not all that bad of a ride. It might even make you chuckle a couple of times.One of the things that also really makes the movie worthwhile is Al Pacino as himself. You perhaps would expect his role to be no bigger than a cameo but as a matter of fact he is essential to the 'story' and you could even see he plays the second biggest and most important role out of the movie because Jack and Jill are both being played by the same actor, Adam Sandler, of course. And yes, Al Pacino was quite awesome in this. Most of the movie its best moments involve him and he plays his role very Pacino-like, so all serious and with all of his talents and skills.It's really too bad he wasn't in a better movie than this one. None of the developments or backgrounds really work out for its story or any of its characters. Because of this also a lot of characters are making a very redundant impression in the movie, such as Jack's wife and kids. And his wife is actually being played by Katie Holmes but her role is hardly important at all for the movie.It's far from the worst movie I have ever seen, it just is not a very well made one.4/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "For an actor, screenwriter and producer with over 30 movies under his belt, you'd think Adam Sandler would've learned you can only disappoint an audience so many times, and there comes a point where effort actually has to be put into the movie for it to succeed.This is what I would've said if this movie had failed. But it actually made money. People went to see a movie where Adam Sandler played in drag for 90 minutes.The fact we as an audience keep giving this man money to make more movies, when other truly great actors and writers struggle to get the attention they deserve is insulting.Let me explain why this movie is so awful. Adam Sandler graduated from making movies that don't really work and aren't interesting to a movie that punishes the audience for seeing it.This movie begins with at least 3 product placements. Dunkin Donuts and Pepto-Bismol, both of which are somewhat important to the \"plot\" and then an incredibly obvious Coke advertisement. Great first impression for your audience which you clearly treat as intelligent consumers.Stuff kind of just happens in this movie, like most of Adam Sandler's movies. All the characters are boring except for Jack and Jill mainly because they cause an actually feeling for the viewer.Pain. This movie manages to make you dislike both of the main characters in a set-up where that should be virtually impossible. Jack is a total jerk to his sister and doesn't handle the situation well by not telling her how he feels in an adult manner. The reasoning for this is probably supposed to be that she is messing with his career, although there isn't one scene that shows this. A main character who has his name in the movie title being unlikable would be bad enough in any normal film, but for this one, that isn't even a primary concern.I'm sure they'll make up for this. I'm sure Jill is the one you understand and empathize with despite her obnoxiousness.Nope.Jill is incredibly annoying and the viewer is given no explanation as to why she is this way. For all I know Jill could be a sadist and is pretending to be stupid in order to annoy everyone she knows.The jokes are also even less funny than most Adam Sandler comedies. There was only one joke I smiled at in this whole film, and of course this was ironically. This was Al Pacino's utterly pointless disguise during the basketball game. Oh did I mention he was in this movie? I think he win's the award for farthest fall from grace. He is identified during the game, which is unintentionally funny because he literally has a first row seat and is sitting next to Johnny Depp, who has even less of a reason to be in this film.Speaking of unfunny jokes there is of course an insultingly racist character and scene in this film. There's a Mexican guy who is of course Jack's gardener. He bring's Jill to his family's party, in a scene which is difficult to describe due to awfulness.Here's a one sentence summary: He tells Jill not to eat the hot peppers and Jill plays soccer and keeps knocking over an old lady who doesn't like her for some reason with the ball and they revive her with the hot peppers and they keep feeding her the peppers ha ha get it guys because she's Mexican and she can eats the hot peppers but white people can't do you get it guys i don't think you get it why aren't you laughingAt this point I would not be surprised if half the people left the theater. But Adam Sandler knew that if one single person had a shred of investment in this film he hadn't done his job right.If you thought it couldn't get any worse, I'm afraid you haven't seen the last 3rd of the movie. In a stupid series of events that are honestly not worth your time because they make no sense Jack has to pretend to be Jill in order to make Al Pacino do an ad for him. Don't ask. So let me explain this.In the movie, Adam Sandler's character Jack, has to dress up in drag as Jill, a character Adam Sandler plays in drag. It's like the inception of stupidity. This is an example of breaking the fourth wall which I'm sure you would be instructed not to do in any starter level screen writing class. This is effectively the same as the movie stopping in the middle to show you a behind the scenes of the movie you are watching. It completely removes any investment in the film.Breaking the fourth wall only works in movies you are not supposed to take seriously or are supposed to break the fourth wall. This includes:Parodies (Ones that are actually funny i.e. Monty Python, Mel brooks, airplane, austin powers, etc) DeadpoolYou could say this movie fits into the not to take seriously category, but the reason it doesn't work much like most parodies is this requires that the movie is actually funny and lovable.",

Sandman, do another Big Daddy or even Just Go With It. I loved Just Go With It. Why wasn't Jared in the scene with the hobo eating the parakeet in the sub sandwich, goooooooshh. Jack and Jill, worst comedy ever?.......noooo. Kids will like it even though the kid characters are terrible. Not that bad. Actually, kinda good.",

In fact I think most of his movies are cringe-worthy and most of his humor is really just annoying rather than funny but that being said I actually thought this was not only funny but that it was a fairly decent movie overall. I found myself really liking Adam Sandler playing Jill and feel that I could watch more of him doing that character. Compared to some of his other movies this was a little more sedate and low-key. The humor wasn't quite so over the top and stupid like most of his movies. The little kids were funny (why aren't they acting anymore?) and some of the cameos were funny (looking at you Johnny Depp in your Justin Bieber T-shirt) so it wasn't just about Adam Sandler. The Al Pacino thing could've been completely stupid and it was to some degree but not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I guess I would say this movie was more heartwarming and sweet rather than Adam's typical inane fare. David Spade as always was completely ridiculously hilarious.The only misstep was Katie Holmes. I really like her (and she was probably at her most gorgeous during filming at that time in her life) so this isn't a slight to her but honestly I think any actress would've been wasted in that role because there really wasn't much to work with. She barely made an appearance and was given so few lines that it was like she wasn't even there at all. They should've just made Adam Sandler's character a widower or something because the wife role just didn't work and Adam and Katie had no chemistry.I don't find much funny so the bar is pretty high to entertain me which is why I can't believe that of all films this is one that managed to make me laugh.

If you're lucky enough not to know this film's plot, let me tell you: Picture a workaholic businessman named Jack, played by Sandler. Now imagine his twin sister, also played by Sandler.

It is just an assortment of stupid jokes revolving around Adam Sandler getting annoyed with Adam Sandler in drag. They said the apocalypse was coming..and perhaps it is. Why do I say that? I kind of want you, the reader to watch Jack & Jill so you can see why I'm just rambling on and saying the apocalypse is coming. It is a film that has to be seen to be believed, and an unshakable experience. Neither of these things are meant in a good way. As someone who goes to a couple hundred films a year, it is, personally, the closest I have been to walking out of a theater in at least two years. Al Pacino, an Oscar winner and Michael Corleone is in this. Pacino is the best part of the film, and he's terrible in it for crying out loud. Pacino, one of the greatest actors of all time is in Jack & Jill. You thought De Niro in Little Fockers was bad? Wait until you see Pacino in this. I really wish I could like this film, or at least not consider it one of the worst films ever made. Sandler's actually a really funny guy when he wants to be. Don't believe me, watch Happy Gilmore. Sandler is also a pretty good dramatic actor. Don't believe me, watch Punch Drunk Love. With this in mind, this film involves Sandler screaming and talking in a weird lispy voice that's his interpretation of a woman. Jack & Jill is the worst film of 2011 so far. It is more dreadful than you could ever imagine. In other words, Jack & Jill doesn't go up a hill, but rather goes down one right when it starts.",

Their is literally a whole scene where the two main characters both played by Adam Sandler are both talking in what they call twin language, which is just them speaking complete gibberish.

Just why would a human being make a film which no one who has even a bit of common scene would say is a good film\" I mean for f***s sake Al Pachino is in this film. AL PACHINO!!! One of my all time favourite actors is in this piece of s***.

I mean on rotten tomatoes, this got a 4% rating while movies I LOVED like Click only got a 33%, movies like Grandmas Boy got only 18%, and Little nicky got 22%. If you like any of these movies a lot, go see it. I found it funny personally. Parts were boring and other parts were hilarious laugh out loud funny. Adam Sandler isn't going down in quality, its that he isn't changing. His movies are always stupid funny and full of slapstick humor which isn't a bad thing in my opinion. He does other movies like Punch Drunk Love, Rain on Me, and Click which are a break from the norm but most of his movies are generally the same. And equally bad in terms of reviews. So again for me i liked it. Funny at parts but don't compare to a critically acclaimed movie because you wont like it then. Compare it to something Adam Sandler has done in the last 5 years and if you liked them then this might be enjoyable.",

There were so many deliberate shots of famous people and of Sony logos and electronic devices, along with Cadillac automobiles, 5-star restaurants, lavish cruise lines and background scenery we missed the point of the story.Too bad, because twins are a special thing even if they are CGI, this movie absolutely missed that mark entirely.",

I enjoyed it, although I think the ending could have used some tweaking. The bond (at the New Year's Eve party) between normal Sandler and Sandler in drag made absolutely no sense and falls flat. As for Al Pacino, well, for me, his storyline yields mixed results. The scene where he thinks he's making a deal with Sandler's sister (which is actually Jack dressed up), also falls flat. Why he never finds out what's going on is anyone's guess. Aside from this and the ending, Jack and Jill is worth watching, even on the silver screen.*** out of ****.",

            "content": "I've never been a big Adam Sandler fan. I have difficulty identifying with or empathizing with the characters he portrays and generally don't find the subject matter of his films particularly interesting or compelling. I can't even remember much from the Sandler films I've seen, other than Jessica Biel undressing in \"I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry\" and the pineapple gag from \"Little Nicky.\" But the good thing about this is that I was able to watch \"Anger Management\" a second time without feeling that I had heard the jokes before. I didn't expect to enjoy \"Jack and Jill\" in the least, but found myself laughing aloud quite often. Al Pacino is hilarious and there are some amusing cameos. Many of the supporting roles are well developed and Sandler is confident enough to work with talented co-stars and allow them to take some of the best lines, even in a bit with an actor complaining that a puppet in a Pepto-Bismol commercial has the better lines. Some of the physical comedy gags are a riot, particularly one in a weight room, one concerning a restroom valet and some of the dance steps. The denouement with Pacino is priceless. This is not really a comedy about a successful man who must endure an annual visit by his uncouth, unsophisticated, uneducated passive-aggressive twin sister. It's a movie about a man who must learn to accept his fraternal twin who is very much alike him physically but very much different emotionally and intellectually, and whom everybody else seems to like despite the flaws that annoy him. The dual Jack/Jill role is good for a couple of laughs and contributes to the theme of the movie, but also gives the movie an underlying creepiness that grated against my deeply ingrained homophobic tendencies. A common movie trope involves a character who cross- dresses and must fend off unwanted advances from suitors of the same sex and/or manage to pursue a love interest of the opposite sex while pretending to be the same sex, all for comedic effect. Here we have a male actor in the role of a female who attracts two ardent suitors. As the audience is acutely aware of the Crying-Game undertone, some of the scenes seem a bit creepy and test the limits of credulity. Jill is abrasive, physically unattractive and about as sexually appealing as the hand puppet seen in the Pepto-Bismol commercial. Personally, I think the movie would have been much better without the dual role and with a female actress playing Jill. Sandler was never convincing as a female and I never believed the interest or fascination of the two suitors.",

Adam Sandler was Adam Sandler, I'm sure u know what I mean. There were some moments where I found myself laughing. But this movies problem is that there weren't nearly enough of those moments.

Not as good as any sandler film till 2008, better than 'just go with it' (which i thought was the lamest sandler movie till date), as good as 'grown ups' may be3. what doesn't work about this movie? the writing, the dialogues should have been more funnier, although its not totally lame, there are some funny lines in between and some physical comedy which saves the movie from a total fiasco.4. How are the performances? Sandler is usual, shouting and screaming which will please his fans as usual, he looks pretty funny as jill and pulls out good physical comedy, Al pacino is a great actor make no mistake, but i felt that he was a miscast, he is too serious an actor to mock himself and because of that in his screen time the movie loses momentum over the humour, i felt that an actor of sandler brand like rob schnieder would have done justice to that role, Katie holmes is there for 15 minutes which is as good as a special appearance.5. Is it going to be detrimental to sandler's career? Nooverall i did not find this movie bad, it was entertaining in parts and sandler fans can watch it, The strength of the movie was its premise which i felt was one of the best ideas, i mean sandler playing his own twin sister made me laugh from the first go, but the ordinary writing stopped it from becoming a happy gilmore or a billy madison...6/10...",

His life turns topsy-turvy when his twin sister comes to visit them in the summer vacation. Jack & Jill , directed by Dennis Duncan , could have been better , funnier and probably more sensible like Sandler's previous which had at least some story to tell. Adam Sandler is not in form this time. He simply goes over the top and is sometimes irritating especially when he is playing the female character. The least I say for the direction , the better for you. The screenplay is terrible. The dialogues are passable. Adam Sandler do make you laugh at certain scenes but at one point of time , he just disappoints. God knows what Katie Holmes was doing in the film. The only silver lining was Al Pacino. The veteran actor has small role to play but he does justice to his part. Jack & Jill is watchable only in parts where as rest of the movie is just about OK. Average 2/5",

This was so much better than any of these movies: Abduction, The Big Year, Harry PotterVII, and The Smurfs. I recommend you watch this movie, even if you're not into comedy films.

            "review_title": "Adam Sandler's worst movie?",
            "content": "\"Jack and Jill\" (2011), well, that's 91 minutes I'll never get back. Wow, and I thought I'd seen bad films before. But this one takes bad to a whole new level! As soon as I saw the first trailer for this \"film\", I said to myself: \"this movie is going to suck!\" Sure enough, it did and it still does. This \"film\" is, by far, the worst Adam Sandler movie. \"Jack and Jill\" has an abysmal and cliched storyline, overall horrible acting, and a boring generic soundtrack to try and tie it all together. The plot is, a man named Jack Sadelstein is an ad executive. His sister Jill is coming to visit him and his family. Doesn't that just sound riveting? Yeah, I've seen this boring and overused trope a million times! It's just like hundreds of other films, an annoying family member comes to visit and cliched hijinks ensue. Granted, the majority of movies are recycled plot threads. However, the goal is to take the familiar concept and try to do it better while adding your own unique twist to it. \"Jack and Jill\" has none of that. To add salt to the wound, the character Jill is also played by Adam Sandler! We'll go into more details about that in a minute. Any way, it's about as cliched as you can get, just like most of Adam Sandler's other films. Bad jokes, toilet humor and subplots that go absolutely nowhere. That's right, for this entire 90 minutes, nothing of substance happens. Another thing, the writing is about as lazy as you can get. To ante up the irritation, Jill has a pet parrot that repeats the same phrase over and over again. It keeps screaming: \"where were you?!\" That's it, seriously, that's all it says and nothing else. Really? You couldn't come up with any other catchphrases? If you can't think of more than one thing for a parrot to say, then the stupid parrot shouldn't have been in the story to begin with! None of the characters are likable, even Al Pacino, who plays himself in this \"film\" couldn't save it. Yep, they somehow convinced Al Pacino to be in this \"movie\". I feel sorry for him! How did they get him to do it? Did they threaten him or his family? Any way, the story is cliched, the characters are cliched and the 91 minutes just feels like an eternity. As far as the acting goes, it's just as bad. This \"film\" has some of the worst acting I've ever seen, I'm serious. It's ironic that Al Pacino, who is such a fantastic actor, gives such a horrible performance here! But, the worst acting performance in this \"movie\" comes from Adam Sandler. When he plays Jack, he's boring. When he plays Jill, he's unbearably annoying! The sad thing is, that a lot of the actors and actresses here have acted better in other movies. What happened to them here? As far as the soundtrack goes, it's about as predictable as you can get. There's nothing in this \"film\" score that's worth writing home about. Now, what do you say we get to the only two good elements in this worthless pile of filth? The only two good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this \"film\" a nice atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, all of them are well-done and still hold up to this day. Which is no surprise, seeing that this \"movie\" came out in 2011. \"Jack and Jill\" is easily the worst Adam Sandler movie, by far. I don't see how his career can possibly recover from this. Yes, I am aware that this \"film\" broke the record for winning the most Razzie awards. I didn't know about that until about a week ago! When I saw that it won those Razzies, I just cracked up. Frankly, I'm surprised it didn't win more than it did! Yes, I do think that this \"movie\" is that bad. I'm giving this \"film\" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Must I tell you to stay away from this \"movie\"? Probably not, because anyone with a brain stem should know how bad it is. When I saw it, I had no choice at all. It was during an airport flight, and I was subjected to watching this piece of garbage. I couldn't avoid it, I was stuck! The tagline on the poster explains it perfectly in one statement; \"it ain't pretty\". At least they're being honest! Any way, for the sake of your decency, avoid \"Jack and Jill\" like the plague. The original nursery rhyme is much more entertaining!",

I can only imagine that he's gotten to that point in his career where he has surrounded himself with \"Yes\" men and women, or someone would have told him it's not working. This isn't Tootsie, nor Mrs Doubtfire, its just Sandler playing an annoying and mostly unfunny and unbalanced character. Unlike other films where actor/comedians are able to pull of multiple characters in a scene, (ie. Eddie Murphy), this film is just Adam Sandler and an annoying Adam Sandler in drag. Part of the limited plot surrounds trying to convince Al Pacino to lower his standards to do a Dunkin Donut commercial. After appearing in this film, I think it would be a leg up for Pacino's career.I made the mistake of watching this on Vudu as a Pay-Per-View film...the best thing I can say is that I fell asleep halfway through it. If you plan to watch this film, I'd advise you to wait a couple weeks for Netflix to feature it for free. Then, at least, you won't feel obliged to watch more than the first 15 minutes.",

But honestly, who watches Adam Sandler movies for their depth and originality? There are some good, funny moments. Having Sandler play both male and female twins is funny. I know it's been done before and arguably better. However, with a smarter and more special effects savvy audience, I get the feeling they're just poking fun at the whole situation. He's just having fun with it. (I hope) They whole movie is stupid, anyway. Do I think this is a good movie? Absolutely not. Would I pay to see it in theaters knowing what I know now? No. I could see myself watching this at home with friends, or a significant other. You get your chuckles out of Jack and Jill. That's all it's worth. Nothing more and nothing less. I think this is near the bottom of the Sandler Spectrum of movies. (which isn't really that high in comparison to other movies, to be honest) At least he does try to get some basic points across while providing laughs. I give it a 5.

I've seen some real stinkers from Sandler, like that \"Zohan\" one (weird and gross) and \"Anger Management\". This was way better than those. Not quite as much crude humor, so that was a welcome relief. Sure, there were several parts that were not very believable, but I don't think this movie set out to be realistic.

It is uncomfortable.3. A lot of supposed humour comes from horribly prejudice comments made by the characters. Such that even if you thought you'd sit down and watch a bad movie... continuing with the viewing would make you feel wrong and uncomfortable.That said I got through this movie and found some random cut away type jokes quite funny. It doesn't stop it being awkward but I do have one thought about how you could enjoy this film better... Well making a comedy that is just offensive is discomforting but we can all see what archetypal movie we're going for here. What if this film was actually just that movie made as a serious drama with a few jokes thrown in there, but the main characters are really portrayed so badly that the serious story turns to uncomfortable character jokes? If you can view it through these eyes where there is a shallow but sensitive story being told about 2 awful human beings that learn to stop being hateful to each other and everyone else, and try to forgive that it is framed as an all out comedy, enjoying only the side-comedy for laughs...

There is a point in the movie where you actually get to see how much work he goes through in his gender change, lets just say I'm not impressed. The other actors that play opposite genders in there movie tend to do it about a 100X more convincingly, when I see Madea I don't think \"Hey that's just Tyler Perry in drag\" I look at Madea and see a hilarious black woman, that if nobody had told me was a man I would have never figured out on my own. This is not the case with Jill, who you think of as a woman, but every time you see her breaks this illusion by simply being Adam Sandler in a wig.The second big problem with this movie is Katie Holmes, whether you love her or you hate her it just seems glaringly obvious that she didn't belong in this movie. I've never looked at Katie Holmes as a comedy actress and that is probably because she has never made me laugh and after watching this movie that record has continued. I don't think she's a bad actress by any means, but there were probably about a thousand better options for the role. She doesn't play off of Sandler very well and they really just seem like 2 people pretending to be married, this is probably the weakest paring that Sandler has ever been a part of on the big screen. By the time this movie ends if have anything at all to say about Katie Holmes character, I highly doubt it anything good. All-in-all my opinion is that this movie probably shouldn't have been made in the first place, the weak pointless storyline, the shallow and mildly upsetting characters, and the fact that the estimated budget for this ridicules film was almost $80 million, all add up to disaster in my book, a disaster that you should probably avoid.",

            "content": "May contain \"spoilers\" To be honest it wasn't the best Adam Sandler offering however the product had some memorable moments. Standout performances include Al Pacino who brought a manic presence to the film, and it was nice to see him do something perhaps out of his comfort zone. He was probably the funniest aspect of this film. He played a very much over the top version of himself much like Neil Patrick Harris did in the Harold and Kumar films. Their were plenty of other celebrity appearances within this film and they where involved in some memorable moments, notably Johnny Depp, Shaquille O'Neil and David Spade and many more. I thought Adam Sandler's Jill was very annoying and hard to relate to, she was cringe worthy to say the least. Still the contrast with the character Jack was not that far removed he too was a major ass.Regardless of this, the film managed to keep me interested with the performances of the rest of the cast, the unsung heroes of this film. Actors like Allen Covert, who played Otto a homeless man that seems to live in Jack's backyard. Even a shout out for the actor that played Jack's son, as he managed to keep things light and played his character more realistically than a lot of the other actors. Watch out for Dana Carvey who plays a puppeteer, it was nice to see him on the big screen again, even if it was brief.To be honest at times Katie Holmes seemed out of place in this film but eventually that stopped being an issue and she blended into the mix. Eugenio Derbez played Felipe the gardener I guess sort of standing in for Rob Schneider who was visibly absent in this film although he was mentioned. Whilst his performance wasn't terrible it just lacked the schneider touch.Overall the film was misguided and lacked direction but was redeemed by the actors, who managed to make something out this confused endeavour. I guess for me this film is a guilty pleasure, so bad that it is good. I like the fact that it awkward at times because real life is like this as well. I like films that provoke mixed emotions. This might not be for everyone but if your an Adam Sandler fan you should at least watch it.",

He must have wanted to help Sandler to redeem his movie, which is so stupid, and except for that scene when Jack and Jill jump on a skipping rope on a cruise.Katie Holmes doesn't have to do much than smiling sweetly all the time, and the kids are more than sympathetic to Jill. why does Jack have adopted kids ? They are sweet any way, but wasted. Indian adopted kid is shown in all kinds of weird get up, God knows why ? With some thoughtful and brilliant direction, and a female actor to play the role of Jill, as some reviewers have suggested, in addition to witty dialogs, this movie, with no good plot line, could have been hilarious.It's Al Pacino, who looks cool, and alluring ,in his role as himself, who manages to entertain us, though for some brief moments, in his rap, his drama on the stage, and with Jill. But his role is also poorly written, and he can not do much to save the movie from disgrace to an actor of Sandler's caliber.An absolute disaster of a movie, watch it out of curiosity at least, as to an experiment in terrible-movie-making !",

Jill meets Al Pacino, and Pacino falls in love with Jill.

Like the real life heist at Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum where thieves got away with nearly $500 million dollars worth of paintings. So when it comes to movies I really like Ocean's Eleven both the original and remake. That is why I'm so amazed by Jack and Jill. The movie is terrible, absolutely painful to watch and I won't even go into detail cause they didn't bother putting any effort into making it, why should I care to give it a proper review.No the reason I like this is because it's a heist movie. They received 80 million dollars to fund this movie, on top of that they had some painfully obvious product placement mainly for Dunkin Donuts and Pebto Bismol. So add even more money on to that 80 million. Now look at the production quality of the movie... how much do you think this movie actually cost to make? The actors are the most expensive thing in this movie. Not even the NBA scene where they went to a Lakers game... they didn't actually shoot a fake game they CGI the actors into a Laker's game. Why? Cause it was cheap as hell to CGI it.So this movie barely cost anything to make... Adam Sandler doesn't even have convincing female body prosthetics. Jill is always wearing a lot of clothes to hide the fact that he probably just has socks in that bra. Just throw make-up on with a wig and do the nails. So how much did this movie actually cost? We'll never know the truth cause this was a scam. Grossed $150 million, budget $80 million + product placement. You didn't watch a movie you watched a heist, and they got away with it.So the score? Well I'm amazed with this movie. I'm not making this score to get you to read this, I'm scoring this an 8 because as a heist, this was amazing. If you watched this you didn't see a movie, there's no conflict or plot, it's just fat people jokes and even a little racism too. No, what you just saw was a heist being done right before your very eyes.",

There was slap stick a plenty and I found myself starting to laugh at Jill's one liners and mannerisms. Jack on the other hand is a thoroughly despicable rogue who I never really warmed to.

Especially the pepper.I loved also to see Pacino.And I think this movie subtly, maybe too subtly, was showing how stupid it is to criticize a celebrity for showing some emotion. It made me think of the big scandal made of Tom Cruise's couch event, which was certainly a natural demonstration of emotion, and that many many people mocked, apparently without any consideration of hurting the feelings of Tom Cruise.There are many things that make me think that this movie speaks a bit about the Cruise life : the word \"cruise\" used, the conversion of Erin - Katie Holmes in the movie - to the religion of Jack, ...Bye. And why be so harsh? Oh and also I loved the little scenes in the beginning and the end of the movie. At the end, I especially loved when it was a little girl speaking about how her brother could put her back on her feet when she'd fall and feel bad.Very kind.Love, Leila",

The story of twins, one a success the other not and getting together with all the family dynamics and comedy which follows, makes it a very funny with many moments of big smiles! Adam Sandler pulls off the movie well with Katie Holms doing a great 'straight' part as Adam's wife. The aspects of the children's 'oddities' was just part of the fun. The part of Adam's character twin sister was also played by Adam and was believable albeit she had masculine tendencies!!! Al Pacino was good as the besotted hopeful boyfriend of Adam's twin sister.

But morbid curiosity got me to see this one; I figured maybe it's \"so bad, it's good.\"Um, no.Nevermind all the product placement (though it's hard to ignore); what on Earth made Al Pacino do this movie?Sandler stars as - you know the plot basically. He plays his sister. (Hard to watch) The jokes aren't funny; the gags about (ugh) \"chimichanga bombs\" was just so disgusting (why on Earth is this supposed to be funny? I'm surprised Sandler didn't make a comedy about how funny IBS is, or such).So this is filled with flatulence jokes (nothing new there....) and with things like a kid, an adopted Hindu son, who you notice right away likes to stick things, tie things to him. Just completely bizarre. Adam Sandler does *not* deserve his wealth by any means.This 91 minutes was just hard to stomach. Al Pacino bizarrely gives a reading like - well, like an actor basically, though this ain't The Godfather or And Justice For All.....\nOne of the greatest actors lowering himself to be in this....And when this movie aims for some kind of emotional, caring scene that might move you, it uses gibberish. The same kind of speech as Billy Madison at the dinner table, practically.There is absolutely no reason for this movie to have ever been made, this is something that I'm sure a total Adam Sandler fan will at least want to see once (though many, and I mean many, big fans of his have stated that they usually love his movies but this is the worst - or one of the worst ones) - but this is something that you should try and avoid by all means...If you're looking for a genuinely funny movie, I have to say this is not one, this just terrible, think about looking elsewhere, you may seriously regret having seen this - especially if you spent money on a rental or purchase.Avoid.

I love most of Sandler's stuff, Big Daddy, or even Click (different genre though).Al Pacino was a little weird but not hideous. Time to time he happened to be even funny. Yes, the taping kid was a little overacted (but sorry, I just couldn't help thinking: THIS IS THE KID OF USA, americanized poor Indian kid, doing whatever he wants to do. So I appreciated some self- irony there by Sandler, which he can do so nicely so often). It may have the charms of Spanglish.

The biggest compliment I can say is that I forgot MY world around....which is lately my biggest issue, films rarely happen to do the trick, to completely engage me and make me forget about my poor life for 1,5-2 hours. This movie jumped the bar.My biggest criticism though: I can really see that throughout the movie Sandler was struggling when talking \"for himself\", the parts when he was talking with Jill, it was shot alone....I felt those parts artificial and not believable.As a single woman - getting older and older - I could relate to the poor Jill, net dating...feeling lonely....I have been there. That part was really nicely done. What I appreciated, too, as usual the minor characters - as his assistant e.g. - were enjoyable, as well, great lines for them.

Those who are unappreciative, just don't get it. I'm hoping for a lot more comedy, and a lot more Adam Sandler.",

Just because it was decent to watch that doesn't mean its not funny. Me and my friends we loved it.Some scenes made me laugh so much that i got tears in my eyes. If you are free and you just wanna laugh then this is a cool one.If you liked (Grown Ups) and (Just Go With It) then you have to watch this!!! I would love to have this one in my DVD collection, because it can be watched more than one time.If you watched the movie and u didn't like it then Just Go With It.................",

The humor in the movie is great, and anyone a fan of the hot chick, scary movie series, mean girls, the house bunny, and austin powers will probably enjoy what this movie has to offer. People have been saying that this is one of the worst movies Adam Sandler has ever written and starred in, I STRONGLY disagree. My family and I laughed through out the hole movie, and a picnic seen far into the movie had me and my grandmother in tears from laughing so hard. The movie starts off with Adam Sandlers' character Jack trying to make a great commercial for pepto bismal, and with his twin sister Jill arriving soon, more pressure is added to everything. There are many great scenes in this movie that even thinking back on them I burst out laughing. Even if you aren't a fan of twisted comedy that is not for children, the stars that are in this movie are worth seeing, such as Katie Holmes, Al Pacino, Adam Sandler(of course), Regis Philbin, Drew Carrey, and a brief appearance of David Spade at the end of the movie. All and all, Jack and Jill is completely worth your time if you are into this type of comedy, you may just find yourself laughing so hard you cant breathe!",

The voice of Adam Sandler playing Jill was also almost always constant.I really loved the incorporation of Hollywood actors as themselves into this movie, specifically the appearance of Johnny Depp. Al Pacino did a great job throughout this movie, and I especially liked the advertisement that the company came up with in the end, starring Al Pacino.I think this film is a pleasant movie that an entire family can enjoy and laugh over! 8/10!",

            "content": "Here's what I think of Mr. Sandler: What the ----ing ---- was he ----ing thinking? He is unfunny. His movies are painfully terrible. His artistic life is a mistake and shouldn't have entered the sacred film waters in the first place. How many studio execs does he have dirt on that he was given a free rein in Hollywood, contributing even more to dumbing down entertainment, dumbing down society? Adam Sandler is a loose cannon who should turn in his filmmaker \"badge\" right now. Right?His flicks bring out the worst in people both on the screen and, ironically enough, in real life, as you can tell by the Jack & Jill's review section. It's no surprise Jack & Jill triggers specific strains of armchair critics -- both pretentious pseudointellectuals and idiotic drones alike (\"0 of 449 people found this review helpful\") -- who give a 10 every inauthentic, vacuous soap opera or a thinly veiled love story made, curated, remade, and multiplied by our megacorporate overlords, their wannabes, and paid stooges serving no other purpose but to sell a jumbo size package of products but are quick to kick this dead horse (I mean, donkey).This flick, watched just around the holidays, is the one that convinced me Sandler is an elaborate troll, the Andy Kaufman of family farce dramas. Not a bitter or cynical one like Ben Stiller whose earlier movies that subtly rip on Hollywood are far more superior in quality and wit to what Sandler has ever produced. This is no smart comedy here hiding a big deep message or social commentary about society or entertainment. Jack & Jill is like a deboned satire without any sardonic teeth that instead hides a sincere and genuine It's a Wonderful Life-esque message behind layers upon layers of cringe comedy makeup.Mr. Sandler's \"comedy\" movies feel like a sick, sadistic experiment on the viewer. As a viewer, you unconsciously bring with you a list of demands or \"expectations\" for whatever you are about to watch and will hold the filmmaker \"responsible\": You expect it to be smart like this, funny like that, \"deep\" this way, poignant that way and here comes Mr. Sandler in a tasteless 1990s Eddie Murphy/Tyler Perry-style drag, debating marketing and showing you ads with gratuitous celebrity cameos in a complete non-parodic tone. It feels like you were just given the middle finger, leaving you angry, frustrated, and not amused at all because no one wants to enter the brutal ring of comedy and end up the punching bag of a joke themselves. At the end of the day whatever Mr. Sandler puts out he does not give one ---- about how many raspberries and thumbs down and praise both ironic and unironic one gives his unfunny flicks on the erudite smart film critic community known as IMDb (we take ourselves very seriously around here) and just continues doing whatever the ---- he wants to do and I respect his style.",

Sadly to say there were some things that were very implausible, but even these items did not distract too much from the movie itself. Jack and Jill is a feel-good movie that is supposed to make you laugh and have a great time. It delivers in that area.

His shtick is making silly, funny, loaded-with-innuendos comedies. My only complaint about this movie would be the overdone and paranoid references to anti- semitism. He overdid it when it came to that but otherwise, I thought the movie was great. The character of Jill is funny, vulnerable and yes...kind of creepy but she's supposed to be!

Good family fun movie. I think some people expect so much from movies that they forget the fun aspect. I have an image of people sitting in front of their TV with a whip saying \" make me happy now!\" or \"entertain me\".

No witty dialogue. Nothing. This movie was built on a garbage script, if, indeed, it had a script at all.In the first 30 minutes, the film went absolutely nowhere.

But once I did, I realised that this was a fantastic film, the high-brow sort of comedy we have all come to expect from Adam Sandler.The man has set the bar extremely high this time, might be hard to top this one. But I do hope he does. My only real concern is for Al Pacinos mental health. This man is deeply disturbed, I mean he played a bizarre parody of himself. It was almost as if he were portraying an amalgamation of every single character he has ever played on screen in his long and illustrious career.All in all a quality film, marred somewhat by the casting of Katie Holmes as Jacks wife Erin. I say this only because she is not a high quality actress, certainly not in the same echelon of say, a Bridgette Wilson or a Fairuza Balk. These are capable actresses of a high calibre. I actually believe that Adam Sandler would have been able to play a third character. Why stop at two? He could play Jack, Jill and Erin. Any more than that is ridiculous, Eddie Murphy territory.Katie Holmes incompetence as an actress is almost as deplorable as her incompetence as a wife. Perhaps this film was the catalyst for her divorce from the great Tom Cruise. Did she not ask him permission? Did he feel threatened by her amazing chemistry with Adam Sandler? Or was Adam Sandlers superiorority the only thing threatening Tom?In summary, a feel good romp the whole family will enjoy. Unless your family supports terrorism.",

So, why all of the bad ratings?Jack and Jill is one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen. I love that Adam Sandler is playing both Jack ad his twin sister, Jill. I thought that he did very well on both parts. Now, I can tell by the reviews that adults do not enjoy this movie. but please! Show it to your kids! They'll love it, just as I did. Some of the humor is slightly gross, and there are one or two slightly inappropriate parts, which is why my rating isn't a 10. Another reason is because I thought having Al Pacino in it was a bit odd, but that is just my opinion.I would show this movie to your kids, and I rate this 7/10.",

I didn't think this was going to be a funny movie at all. Adam as a woman? But it worked and he made a pretty woman at that. Scary. It reminded me a lot of Robin Williams comedy. The cameo's the stars it was a very well done movie. The only thing I didn't like was Katie Holmes part, it should have had a bit more action on her part. She was almost there only for show.

Very typical Sandler Humor along the lines of Dumb and Dumber, but a little higher on the scatological scale. Not belly laughs, very predictable, clever at best, slapstick at worst. Most bits are funny.What takes this to the next level is the performance of Al Pacino. The ongoing gag works and although a little redundant, it is over the top enough to make the movie worthwhile. While it is certainly not in the same league as Animal House, Superbad, or Monty Python, it does not deserve the universal bashing it has received.",

We laughed more than our son did - and he laughed pretty hard. The whole idea of putting Al Pacino in the middle of it all works great. It is a great foil. And Al happily goes wayyyy over the top and makes it work. The writing is sometimes brilliant and it is a heck of a lot funnier and more entertaining than any other comedies I have seen recently. I watched 5 minutes of Saturday Night last week and switched channels - even with Emma Stone!. I laughed all the way through Jack and Jill We loved it.

That being said, it wasn't so bad I couldn't sit through it, mainly due to the fact that the actors are inexplicable invested in the material. The acting never gets so dreadful or cringe worthy that you need to turn it off, if you can tolerate Sandler's nasally whining that is. I can definitely understand why so many couldn't though, and if the voice happens to be like nails on a chalk board for you there are absolutely no redeeming qualities to make it worth sitting through.I happened to have the variable effect of watching it after nearly 4 years of awful reviews from critics and us regular folk alike, then hearing from a credible friend that it wasn't AS bad as advertised. So I went in with a weighted approach, expecting it to be horrendous but allowing for a little more leeway before deciding to turn it off. Lo and behold I survived. IMDb has it at 3.5 at the moment and that's pretty apt. I guess if there's anything to take from reading this is it's tolerably bad for those who can get through a series of annoying character traits and those awful low brow Happy Madison gags that have sadly become a trademark of theirs, exposing an unfortunate side of Sandler's sense of humor that is painfully unfunny.",

Mom was a rifle type of gal.) \u2013 That being neither here nor there: this movie goer' was actually very impressed with Jack and Jill.My husband and I took our 13 year old twin sons, who laughed the entire show. It does take a few moments to forget that Jill is actually Adam Sandler, but all of us agreed that we soon saw Jack and Jill as two different characters, and as twins. Grown twins do fight and no one knows better which buttons to push. When my grown boys disagree (as they often do) the rest of us just stay out of the way.I'm beginning to wonder if some of the online reviewers didn't see a different movie than we? And different not only than we -but different than the others in the theater with us. EVERYONE was laughing. Some hysterically.We went expecting a zany, light hearted comedy. We actually came away with more than that. Not only was the interaction of the twins hilarious, but interjected moments of the unique sense of loss that Jill felt, as the caretaker of their mother, were very insightful. I lost my own mother two years ago. We had our own special holiday traditions, and life has been very different without her. There was more to this little movie than first meets the eye, and our family was very pleased.Every actor, down to the smallest child with the lobster taped to his back, was absolutely wonderful! Al Pacino as Al Pacino was genius! Katie Holmes and the dish of chocolate ice-cream! That was not only funny, it was just right! Not too much, not too little. Every move she made in the entire movie was totally believable. And guess what? I'm not a huge Katie Holmes OR even an Adam Sandler fan; however he was quite a bit of a genius himself, keeping in character for TWO characters! (And NO, I'm not the mother of any of these people. Trust me, out of SIX kids, only one's in California. And he is not an actor. Can't tell you what he does, or he'd have to kill you ;-)Just see the movie. Decide for yourself. Take twins of any age. It's safe. (Ok, so one Mexican American does look under Jill's skirt, but who can blame him for wondering what was going on down south of that?)",

It isn't a movie about taking in a homeless man for Thanksgiving... that's just one small scene. Having some knowledge of cinema should help you enjoy this film. (Just for reference, I have a graduate degree from USC, I'm over 30 and female). LOVED IT! LOVED IT! LOVED IT! The laughter in the theater here in Monterey was loud, so clearly it's not the one-star film some of these reviewers have said. Yes, Adam Sandler doesn't make an attractive woman... he's not supposed to be pretty! There are 'family moments' that made us cringe... but that was the point.

As the movie progresses you find that the relationship between Jill and Al Pacino was well thought out and well written. Adam Sandler's characters in this movie are very charming and funny.

Adam Sadler likes to remind us (every 3rd movie he releases)he is both Jewish and pro Israeli,Don't Mess With Zohan etc. Which is his business. But if the references in Jack And Jill were Christan or Muslim, the film would have rightly been sold as a Christian or Muslim 'comedy',instead Jack And Jill is trotted out as an Adam Sadler comedy.

The plot was heart warming and I think that this is a movie that is fun for the whole family. I laughed a bit. But there is only one thing that doesn't make this movie all that great. Everyline that Al Pacino spoke had no sense of comedy. You could tell that he was trying to act but didn't succeed. I say that he is better for the original genre that he acts best with. Drama.

At least, this movie teaches you to be more loving towards your relatives, not to be so hard on each other and the ones you love, in a humorous way. Do you think that one of the best actors out there, Al Pacino, would've accepted to play in the worst movie if he didn't think it would've been a hilarious movie to watch with the kids and laugh?

But sadly this movie did somewhat disappoint. It was very hard to see Adam as both characters and i don't think he did a very good job at acting on Jills character. It just didn't work. There was some funny bits in the movie and i believe the plot wasn't too bad either. This movie could have been a great movie, but with the bad acting and a few stupid moments in this film it was nowhere near as good as his older more vintage films. Im starting to think that his acting career is in limbo, even though he is one of my favorite actors. I honestly don't recommend this movie unless you want a few cheap laughs.",

Jack and Jill however feels as if it should be shown 24/7 in Guantanamo. Jill is written to be intentionally annoying, but not in the awkward Paul Blart way, more like that kid who wouldn't shut up in school. From trans jokes to Holocaust jokes, most of the comedy was of the extremely low hanging fruit variety. Even if you are high, stay away.",

I practically felt like shooting him every time his face was on the screen. I have nothing against him but I found his presence to be unnecessary.

If you loved his movies like Happy Gilmore and billy Madison, or movies his crew are in like grandma's boy, the likes of Covert, Swardson. Well then you will sit back and laugh and enjoy it for the silly concept it is.It's funny because exactly what I hear on the \"on demand\" promo is exactly what you get. All this slap stick crazy stuff going on yet the wife in the movie keeps you grounded and makes your mind think its believable.I read all the reviews and then went with my gut to decide to watch it. It was a good laugh with the family. To me you have to embrace it all for what it is and take to heart the meaning. Sandler opens with many real sets of twins discussing likes and dislikes of being a twin. To me that sets you up to say here is a guy showing you that this is a heartwarming topic, now let me make 90 minutes of slapstick comedy about it. Covert all though a small roll is funny when in it. Al Pachino gave me a new respect for his range. He was good at being a slapstick version of what media makes us think his real life is. If you liked the silliness of happy Gilmore or Madison this right there with it. The difference is those where both about a young man's journey growing up, this is in a family setting so the humor is structured different and has to be. The kids are great in the movie, the subtle and not much discussed issues the kids have bring underlying humor. His adopted son tapes everything to himself, his daughter dresses her doll exactly like her no matter what activity.I just feel that you may not like it to an 8 like me, but I would give happy Gilmore or billy Madison the same, but anyone that goes less than a 5 doesn't like Sandler's comedy or his movies in the first place as a whole. If you are a true Sandler fan you will enjoy this.",

I had not read anything about this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised that Al Pacino was in it, not only him but other celebrities such as Johnny Depp .. and this was awesome because actors playing themselves in ridiculous situations. Al Pacino did an amazing job, because he was able to make fun of himself, I laughed SO hard many times. \"This is L.A. we have Bruce Jenner playing whoever...\" LOL, or.. about his Oscar statue being broken.. \"Surprisingly I don't have others...\" hahahahaha. Very good! very funny movie, with great jokes! but don't expect a LIFE LESSON out of it, it's a no-brainer (as many other people have described it. It is very underrated here on IMDb, and I was impressed with that, I personally thought \"Grown Ups\" was really boring and it has higher rates than this one.. Go figure!

Al Pacino probably plays his worst role ever, and he plays himself just like every other actor in this movie. INCLUDING David Spade.

I really do think that people who disliked the movie didn't realise that it was Sandler on both parts all the time!!!! omfg that was genius!!.Jack is a unique character that Sandler portrayed perfectly,giving the character the perfect mix between deep and mysterious and a comicality funny character,i was gobsmacked by his performance.",

We all had a good laugh and it kept us entertained for an hour and a half. I don't think it's meant to be taken seriously, it is a comedy after all and the fact that we saw Al Pacino, Johnny Depp and David Spade in it was well worth the effort. It had the usual toilet humor, farts, diarrhea and a sweaty bed but the cockatoo almost stole the show. I have seen films worse than this and I don't think it deserved the harsh criticism it has received. We all have someone in the family that we are embarrassed about and want to get rid of at times and this exaggerated the fact. I think Adam Sandler has a lot of talent and I don't think we've seen the best of him yet. I would love it if he tackled a really serious role, just to see what he is really made of.",

We watched with a group of people, all ages, and roared in laughter. Sandler did a fantastic job with this one. I thought it was odd that Pacino was in this and the part he played was out of his ordinary character, but \"Jill\" was a scream! We rewound parts and watched over and over as we rolled on the floor in laughter. This movie was not crude humor, sexual, nor did it have drugs or alcohol in it. Just a great film, funny.....funny.....funny! I would recommend this one for any family who just wants to sit down with a bowl of popcorn and laugh. The Price is Right scene as well as the Jet Ski Scene are a priceless!",

Sander isn't that convening as a girl but thats only because his kind of character doesn't really work as a girl. the other cast are also good but there not really that importunate compared to Adam Sander. i have given it a 10 out of 10 only because i couldn't bring mys to give it any less. if their was a choice of like 9.5 i would give it that but seeing as there is only 9 and 10 then i would rather give it a 10 then a 9. BTW the linkage in the film can became a bit unappropriated but its not to the point that it cloud be considered bad for kids. in conclusion its an OK movie thats not as bad as people say.",

If you're a fan of Adam Sandler and his films then you will most probably be laughing most of the way through as I was. I think a lot of the reviews are unduly harsh on this film and i expect it will probably gain popularity over time. It's not a serious film. It's a comedy and if it makes you laugh it's achieved it's goal. It's slapstick and Adam Sandler dressed as a women is pretty ridiculous, but it's part of the humor that adds to the comedic value of the film. If you liked Bucky Larson (which i also think was very funny and it was similarly slated) then you'll like this. I think there's a snobbery in comedy about it needing to be realistic and i don't think it needs to be.",

Apparently I have to have ten lines, so I guess I'll finish this review talking about IMDb lack of respect for an economy with words. When Pacino is serious at the end it was amazing he did that with a straight face. I have two more lines even though it was mainly about Pacino in this role.

Terrible Screenplay and Writing so bad that whoever wrote it should be thrown from a plane into the Arctic Ocean. An EXTREMELY unfunny script that made me wonder how film got its $79 million . An extremely unlikeable Jack (played by Adam Sandler) and Jill (who is also played by Adam Sandler) . Racist Hispanic stereotypes (Mexican picnic scene anyone also THAT grandma). Al Pachino also makes an appearance making me wonder how expensive his bills were that the guy who stared in The Godfather (note have not seen that movie) took the role. This means a romance between Jill and Pachino so forced that it would make a gunshot seem weak by comparison. That romance borders on homosexuality since Jill is played by Adam Sandler a dude. This films incredibly lame plot boils down to \"Jill visits Jack, Jack trys to get Al Pachino to star in a Dunkin Donuts commercial\".

Every fart joke in the movie leaves the viewer dumbfounded. \"Did they really just. Again?\" is what you'll be saying after every fart joke. Adam Sandler takes on the challenging task of playing a man and a woman. The way he portrays the jill character is one reminiscent of Tony Montana. The inflections in his voice give this powerful Cuban presence, without even being Cuban. Adam Sandler is a modern-day Picasso in the way he paints a picture for his characters. Every role he plays is a new painting, and it's up to the audience to interpret them in their own way. Some people like to call this movie an abomination, abysmal even. But they're just jelly.

How many times did Jack or Swardson or whoever get hit in the nuts?  3?  4?  I lost count.  And there's almost a twisted genius to essentially making Jill a fart machine.  \"The people want farts?  Boy howdy, they're gonna get farts... Big chimichanga farts that will rattle the whole damn movie!\" Sandler muttered pre-production.There's something far more sinister about Jack & Jill compared to Sandler's other, slightly less terrible comedies of late.  His contempt for the half-wits that lop this stuff up in his audience is laid bare for all to see.  He simply doesn't care.  Remember the South Park where they parodied the trailer?  \"Who cares?  You'll pay to see it, f--- you!\"  They hit the nail on the head.  That's this movie.

MostI'm not going to say that Jack and Jill is a bad movie. That wouldn't be doing it justice. Jack and Jill is hands down the worst film ever made, not only failing on a comedic and technical level, but also on the level of entertainment. Most bad movies garner a few chuckles based on pure goofiness, such as The Room. Jack and Jill couldn't even make me smile once, as I was too busy being appalled at the atrocities I was witnessing onscreen. Adam Sandler has become the representation of cheap, poorly executed Hollywood blockbusters and whatever comedic value he had in the past is gone. His career has been on the decline for years, and this abomination was the long-awaited dagger to his image. It took two Adam Sandlers, both completely unlikable and instantly annoying characters, for people to detect his formula of putting little effort into filmmaking and making large profits off of fart jokes and the occasional adult humor. Even the presence of Al Pacino can't save the movie, and makes it even more depressing when one considers that this powerhouse actor accepted a role in Sandler's cinematic prostitution.\rJack and Jill is a marvel. I can't say I hate any other movie with such unrelenting passion, especially when I realize that ten-years olds are being showed this racist, mysoginistic, and downright unpleasant series of unfinished storyboard sketches. I sincerely hope that these younger audiences don't look to Sandler as a king of comedy, because then the next generation of filmmakers will have a corrupted vision of what true comedy really is. Jack and Jill should serve as the shining example of how to fail in making people laugh: sacrificing the likability of its characters and the intelligence of its plot for inane body humor and inexplicable attempts at social satire. It fails not just because its a broken mess of a movie, but because we all know its creator has the potential for so much better, and his creative vision has been blinded by the allure of box office success. Whether Sandler can turn his career around from this apparent black hole remains to be seen. But for now, Jack and Jill remains as a gigantic blemish not only on his career, but on the entirety of American cinema.\r 0/10\r Follow me on twitter. @cbeers2513",

Married to Katie Holmes Jack is totally repulsed by his twin sister, Jill. As his twin, Mr. Sandler plays her as such a revolting character so as to make her totally unbelievable and there, of course, lies the defect in the entire film. There is no credibiliyt in Jill's character for she is as obnoxious as she is unreal and without reality, humor doesn't work. Relying for the most part on bathroom humor (literally and figuratively) the movie asks us to believe that Al Pacino, who also stars in the film, would ever even sit next to let alone be enamored by Jill. It asks too much so, at a certain point, the viewer just doesn't care. I give this a rating  of  20 and remind its producers and proponents that although the story book \"Jack and Jill\" may have gone up the hill, this movie isn't going anywhere but down. The best word to describe this entire 96 minute theatrical experience is \"disappointing\".",

Going into it, I usually know what to expect but this movie was definitely something else. From the first 10 minutes, I knew it was a train wreck. The idea of one man playing both a woman and a man is not new though. Eddy Murphy did it, Tyler Perry did it, and many before them. This, though, was just a god awful mess from the very start. Sandler plays up the annoying chatty-mouth Jewish woman stereotype to the 10th degree and it doesn't help the film nor make it any funnier. In fact most of the scenes are awkward, and drag on far longer then they reasonably should. I have seen plenty of Adam Sandler movies over the years and although they're generally a dumb bucket of laughs, this one was the most horrible unfunny mess of a film that he has created to date.  It's much worse than Grown Ups 2 which had no plot whatsoever, and that's saying a lot. It's much worse than 8 Crazy Nights which at least had the redeeming quality of decent animation going for it.

This film is nothing more than a way for Adam Sandler to do a role that draws more attention to himself. Jack and Jill is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Sandler is obnoxious as Jill! His voice is whiny and he's not much better as Jack, making this film excruciating to watch because he's in every scene and the supporting characters are completely irrelevant. Oscar winner and 9 time Oscar nominee, Al Pacino, has a major (shameful) cameo role; he should sue Sandler for using him in this dog sh** film. Consider yourself warned!",

I don't know, its hard to explain. The thing that actually brought down the quality of this movie for me was the fact that I know that Adam Sandler can do SOOO much better than this movie that everyone hated! It sucks that I saw this movie after I saw \"Wedding Singer\" or I would at least give it a 6 out of 10, but unfortunately that's not the case. So I don't know that I would recommend the movie to anybody but I won't say that the movie's terrible because its not, so I'll just give it a 5 out of 10.",

It is a fact that \"Jack and Jill\" isn't as funny as most of Adam Sandler's previous movies, but it did have it's funny moments, what I took away from the movie is it's lack of witty humor, most of the humor in this movie is slapstick. What can I say, I need brains with my jokes. The acting wasn't perfect and its jokes were not great, but I did have a somewhat good time with this movie, I will not give this movie a positive review because of its lack of humorous moments and the film in general was not all that great, it wasn't terrible but it wasn't good either, I will always have mixed feelings for this movie and probably will never see it again. So, my final thoughts are, the movie is very forgettable, it was somewhat entertaining and it was Adam Sandler's least entertaining movie. If you like cheesy humor, you'll like this movie, but for anyone else who like witty humor, you might want to skip this film.",

Well this is a film that truly deserves a 0. Adam Sandler has never produced a good film, so I didn't go into the film with high hopes. But to see such talented actors such as Al Pacino being in this is unbelievable. All of the jokes are basically people just falling down/getting hurt and racist jokes (this is probably the most racist film I have ever seen), The film has WAY to much product placement (the whole film feels like a Dunkin Doughnuts commercial, and when the go onto the cruise, it feels like an actual commercial for that cruise.) My final major problem I had with this film was the amount of celebrities appearing in the film just for a paycheck and actually doing nothing. (Johnny Depp just had to sit there) Jack and Jill is an awful film with bad acting, bad jokes, and terrible and awkward moments that tries to make you care for the characters. Do not watch this.
