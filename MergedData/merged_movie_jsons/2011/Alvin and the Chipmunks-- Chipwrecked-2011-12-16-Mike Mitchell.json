I honestly don't know what movie those people were watching. \"Chipwrecked\" is a very entertaining movie. It has a lot of laughs and some nice music. It has a great villain in David Cross. Cross has one funny line after another. But it's the love that Dave has for the chipmunks that makes this movie so good. They make him crazy but he loves them anyway. What's wrong with that?",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chip-Wrecked",
            "content": "For as long as the Chipmunks can be milked to draw in the holiday crowds, the sequels will never stop. After all, the digital templates are there and done up to be recycled countless of times, and the live action characters just jolly well need not be there for things to work. Pop hits between the films serve as the highlights for getting the munked treatment, and while they do sound cute initially, eventually this novelty will soon wear off. Director Mike Mitchell, who sounded the death knell for Shrek with his Shrek Forever After, happened to do the same for Alvin and the Chipmunks in coming up with something so uninspired and clearly going through the motion.The first film as expected is the origin film, followed by the sequel which is more or less a mirror image of the first, except with the trio from the opposite sex known as the Chippettes. In the third film, with everyone - Alvin (voiced by Justin Long), Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler), Theodore (Jesse McCartney), Brittany (Christina Applegate), Jeanette (Anna Faris) and Eleanor (Amy Poehler) - all living under the same roof as Dave (Jason Lee) their surrogate dad/manager, you'd expect that perhaps things can get a wee bit more cerebral, but alas all we're getting is a rehash of characterization not already seen in the films, and done countless of times in their animated series.Alvin is still being Alvin, Simon needs to chill and Theodore just needs to be cute. So goes for the Chippettes with vain Brittany, introverted Jeanette and Eleanor just makes a lot of clothes and costumes in this one, since they're all stuck in an unnamed island (in Hawaii on location so it seems). What was to be a family cruise vacation turned out to be an abandoned island adventure, with Ian (David Cross) the chipmunks' ex-manager and one time music executive on board as well as the nasty opposition (too weak to be called a villain or the antagonist), and Zoe (Jenny Slate), a woman stuck in the island for close to a decade, and exhibiting the very same signs of loneliness that Tom Hanks' Chuck Noland did in Cast Away, except that she has more friends other than Wilson.Centering around the chipmunks' fight for survival amongst themselves and with Zoe, as well as Simon and Alvin's temporal transformation in character - one being French (don't ask) and more carefree while the other getting all serious and responsible, the story plays out like an extended cartoon episode, with Dave and Ian on a quest to try and rescue their cash cows before something untoward get to happen to them, which in the story, is zilch given a low threat situation, most of the time. Nothing spectacular gets to happen in the film, and it runs like on a plateau without any highs or lows, and soon you'll feel you may be better off looking at caged animals in a zoo.Which is a bit frustrating because the story's written by both Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger, who were also responsible for what I felt were some of the more intelligent animated films in recent years with their Kung Fu Panda and its sequel, having the right elements balanced in terms of story, characters, comedy, action and entertainment for both the kids and accompanying adults alike, but this effort seemed to be written without much heart put into it to cater for the lowest common denominator, and it shows. Granted they also did stinkers like Monsters Vs Aliens, but when you set the bar higher, that's where you'll be benchmarked against, and that's where this proved to be a total Chip-Wreck.",

            "review_title": "If you've never liked the singing and dancing Chipmunk and Chipette trio, you're certainly not going to after this rehash of a sequel",
            "content": "You don't change the formula, not when it is one that has worked to amass a cool US$400mil worldwide per picture. So despite boasting a new director in the form of 'Sky High' and 'Shrek Forever After's' Mike Mitchell, this third live-action adaptation of the classic animated TV series is surprisingly alike to the earlier two instalments. That's going to be good news for those who loved both the first 'Alvin and the Chipmunks' as well as the 'Squeakquel'- but for those hoping that this third outing will finally have the charm that eluded the first two, we'd like to warn you to be disappointed.Penned once again by the duo of Johnathan Aibel and Glenn Berger, the 'Chipwrecked' adventure uses yet another paper-thin plot to string together the hi-jinks of the singing and dancing Chipmunk trio as well as their female Chipette equivalents. Here, Alvin's mischief while vacationing on a cruise with their kind beleaguered owner Dave (Jason Lee) leaves the Chipmunks and the Chipettes stranded on a desert island with a volcano that's about to blow its top. Oh and did we mention Alvin's hand-gliding stunt also lands both Dave and their arch-nemesis from before, Ivan (David Cross), overboard and washed up on the same, albeit different corner of the, island?It's no secret how- let alone if- the Chipmunks and Chipettes manage to make it off the island alive, and not even the addition of a new character, Zoe (Jenny Slate), whom Aibel and Berger unabashedly models after Tom Hanks' FedEx employee in Castaway, adds much life to what is really an awfully predictable plot. Admittedly, none of the Chipmunk movies have had much story, and to expect better from 'Chipwrecked' would therefore be a tall order. Like the previous instalments therefore, this one is simply content to coast on the 'aw-shucks' cute charms of the chipmunks. Indeed, each Chipmunk seems to be calculated to appeal to a certain demographic- whether the playful leader Alvin, the responsible brainiac Simon, or the adorably na\u00efve Theodore, as well as the corresponding Chipettes Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanor. Their incessant high-pitched bantering and bickering that unfolds at a lightning pace is still clearly the highlight of the show, not forgetting of course their regular song and dance numbers set to some of the contemporary chart- topping pop tunes like Lady Gaga's 'Bad Romance', Willow Smith's 'Whip My Hair' and Destiny Child's 'Survivor'. Like we said, it's worked before- like a charm, if we may add- with family audiences, so expect more of the same this time round. A midway twist where Simon starts assuming an alter-ego in the form of Frenchman Simone after getting bitten by a poisonous spider tries to inject some novelty into the Chipmunks' routine, but the initial appeal of watching the usually rational Simon turn debonair and somewhat impetuous quickly wears out its welcome. Faring slightly better is the budding attraction between Simon and Jeanette, manufactured nonetheless to elicit maximum geek appeal.Speaking of geek, those who loved 'My Name is Earl' may be dismayed to find that Jason Lee plays again the lead human character in the movie- and while the talented Jason looks like he could easily sleepwalk through the role, he does succeed in drawing out more than a few laughs in between his repartee with David Cross. Mitchell however displays little of the flair he exhibited in the superhero surprise 'Sky High' and his work here is as nondescript as his earlier in 'Shrek Forever After'. Of course, the fault isn't entirely Mitchell's- after all, the template for the 'Alvin and the Chipmunks' live-action films have been pretty much fixed in stone after the resounding success of the first two movies. This three-quel is made only for those who have enjoyed both its predecessors, since ultimately it rehashes the same singing and dancing Chipmunk formula. Nevertheless, it's fast becoming a foolish consistency, and the likely fourth entry better not just be simply another Chip off the old block. www.moviexclusive.com",

            "content": "I sort of enjoyed the previous two movies, they were not great movies but I found them quite cute. I wish I could say the same for this latest instalment, but I can't. It does have its moments, Jason Lee and David Cross are decent and have some entertaining exchanges. The film apart from some slapdash editing does look reasonable with the chipmunks looking serviceable and the scenery beautiful.Best of all is Theodore, he always was adorable and made you want to cuddle him and here is no exception.On the other hand, Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked feels rather lacklustre this time around. The pop songs was a bonus in both of the previous two movies, here they sound really tired with generic melodies and forgettable lyrics. The vocals themselves are okay, not too annoying considering the tone, but again nothing out of the ordinary. The messages about family ties and responsibilities are important ones but they seem rather forced here.The script generally was weak, there was very little that was fresh or funny for me apart from the exchanges between Cross and Lee, and there are some lines that have been covered in previous reviews that really don't belong in a family movie. The story like the previous two is predictable, except this time around it is not as charming or exciting.I didn't care for the characters, excepting cute little Theodore. Zoe the eccentric castaway is more annoying than endearing, and something about Alvin rubbed me up the wrong way, he came across as too much of a jerk in some scenes. The acting/voice work is mixed, I liked Cross, Lee and Jesse McCartney, and Justin Long and Matthew Gray Gubler are alright I guess even with the bad material, but Jenny Slate didn't raise a single smile and the rest ranged from adequate to bland.All in all, not as tortuously bad as some have said, but it wasn't anything special to me. By all means I understand why some may like it, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. 4/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Based on the musical band and the children's cartoon, which I remember watching, the first film was terrible, the second film was only mildly watchable but still tedious, I think I knew what to expect with this third film, directed by Mike Mitchell (Surviving Christmas, Sky High). Basically David 'Dave' Seville (Jason Lee) with the Chipmunks: Alvin (Die Hard 4.0's Justin Long), Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler) and Theodore (Jesse McCartney) and the Chipettes: Brittany (Christina Applegate), Eleanor (Amy Poehler) and Jeanette (Anna Faris) are on a vacation on a cruise ship, but of course the furry cannot stay away from trouble for long. After messing about on the ship deck the Chipmunks and Chipettes end up accidentally thrown overboard, Dave chases after to rescue them, with his old boss Ian Hawke (David Cross) tagging along, the six friends end up marooned on a tropical paradise island, and some time after them, unseen, Dave and Ian are swept up on the island also. The island appears to be deserted at first, but then seemingly crazy castaway Zoe (Jenny Slate) shows up, with her various playing balls that she talks to, she claims she has been stranded for years waiting to be rescued, Dave and Ian search the island to find them. On the island Eleanor sprains her ankle, and Simon is bitten by a spider, with the side effects being that he changes personality, into French adventurer chipmunk Simone (Alan Tudyk), while the other Chipmunks and Chipettes try to make the most of the situation they are in \"Simone\" stumbles upon a piece of treasure Zoe has been looking for. Zoe suddenly turns nasty against her furry \"friends\" and demands to know where the hidden treasure she has been searching for is located, by this time Dave and Ian find them, it becomes a chase to rescue their friends and save themselves from the threat of the erupting volcano, of course in the end all of them get away from the island in time, and the Chipmunks and Chipettes make it in time to perform at the International Music Awards. The animated animals are relatively cute and funny in moments, while the live actors are rather cheesy, the choice of songs is varied, including \"Trouble\", \"Party Rock Anthem\", \"Whip My Hair\", \"Kumbaya\", \"Survivor\", \"Bad Romance\", \"S.O.S.\" and \"Firework\", some are catchy, the problem of annoying squeaky voices and immature behaviour remains, and it is predictable, the kids may enjoy it, but this overall is a silly part-animated comedy adventure.

            "content": "Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked (2011): Dir: Mike Mitchell / Cast: Jason Lee, David Cross, Jenny Slate, Andy Buckley, Michael P. Northey: Third in this tiresome and annoying franchise. The subtitle physically refers to the fact that Dave and his fuzzy companions are stranded on an island, but it also symbolizes the behaviors of the chipmunk personalities. That is about the height of any intelligence coming out of this waterlogged screenplay. Dave and his singing chipmunks are on a cruise and one thing leads to another until they end up on an island. This is quite boring and Mike Mitchell does his best as director whose film is totally dependant on the chipmunk talking visuals. Mitchell previously made the underrated Surviving Christmas as well as the retread Shrek Forever After. Jason Lee is well cast as Dave, the chipmunks owner and manager but the role is routine and cardboard at this point. The same goes for David Cross as Ian the scheming villain who reemerges in a pelican mascot outfit on the cruise. Jenny Slate plays a total moron named Zooey whom the chipmunks and chipettes encounter on an island. The reference to Cast Away is one of the better jokes but this character is so brain dead that viewers will likely lose any sympathy for. Andy Buckley is flat as the annoyed cruise captain. Michael P. Northey is billed as the Hawaiian Shirt Guy, and that is about as creative as this junk gets. While Alvin, Simon and Theodore are visually amusing, watching the chipettes in bikini outfits dancing to techno music is enough to make a person toss this family oriented crap overboard.

I can say without any doubt at all that she's too advanced for it. There were a couple of scenes that elicited a chuckle from her - and I think one got a chuckle out of me, but that was it. There were other scenes that caused her to engage in her favourite hobby of drawing, while I mercifully caught up on some sleep two or three times. This is not a good movie.The story is empty throughout and silly most of the time. Yeah, I know, it's about singing chipmunks, so of course it's silly. But still. And the evil Ian is still a part of this. I really found him irritating in the first movie. Why is he still there? The title of the movie more or less explains it - the chipmunks are on a cruise heading to the International Music Awards when they're accidentally cast away on a deserted island. (And, yes, there is great homage paid to the movie \"Cast Away\" in this.) But there's really just nothing to maintain interest in this.If you're over the age of 5, you probably won't get anything out of this. The 5 and under set might appreciate the undeniable \"cute-ness\" of the chipmunks. But having seen this, I do hope it's the end of the series. (2/10)",

            "content": "\"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" is a franchise that's been getting much popularity with many kids of passing generations. The film series, based on the 80's to 90's cartoon, based on the 50's album, tells the story of the relationship of Dave Sullivan taking care of 3 chipmunks who become rock stars, and it's been told as it's been. The film series is something that most people find to be anything, but masterpiece material.With the first film, it was a decent film that introduced the new generation to Alvin, Simon and Theodore, on how they met Dave Suvil, played by Jason Lee, but didn't do as good as was expected. The film, however, was far from terrible, so it was something one could watch and enjoy from time to time. The second film however, didn't do as well as the first. It felt too much like the first film, with David Cross being the film's antagonist again, and repeating some of the same jokes. With the new film, only four words would describe it.It's not the 'Squekquel'.The new film does try to work in a new kind of concept and bring something new into it, but mostly falls flat due to most clich\u00e9s. This is the only movie where David Cross isn't the villain and it doesn't involve any of the chipmunks or chipettes in cages. I do give credit for trying, but it's not enough to say that it's as good as the original. I'm not saying that it's TERRIBLE or anything, but it's not good either. Some of the jokes in the beginning along with some scenes with David Cross are what I seemed to have laughed. The pop-culture references and songs sung in the film are sort of recognizable, but some aren't ones that I'm not very fond of.Another thing that is kind of upsetting is the cast of characters. If they're going to alter the voices anyway, then they could've just gotten some new actors to do it anyway. But then again, some people are desperate for work and will do anything for a paycheck. Would I say it's bad? Mostly, but it has it's moments sometimes. Would I pay tickets for this in the theater? Technically, I did, but for others, I'd wait to rent it.",

Having not had the time to watch N\u00ba2, I came across this one and decided to watch it. By the end of the movie I had smiled and laughed in some parts, but overall the plot was very uneven. I am not gonna bicker too much since it is a family movie and the little ones probably laughed and had a lot of fun. To summarize some of the problems I had with the movie, I believe that some of the characters were a bit too cartoonish (I shouldn't be surprised though) and a weak plot guideline that doesn't leave anything to the imagination. The movie also lacks any real thrills, which hurts its chances with more mature audiences. I will say that the performances of Jason Lee and David Cross were what I expected. Alvin and company are undoubtedly a good way to spend an afternoon with your family watching movies, but do yourself a favor and don't watch it alone.Rating 6/10",

Jason Lee, who must be getting an overwhelming payday to keep coming back, spends most of the time whining. The introduction of Zoe, played by Jenny Slate, was a cheap attempt to add a foil to the characters. Honestly though, she came across more as irrelevant. By no means was I looking for a movie written by Aaron Sorkin, Academy Award winning screenplay writer of The Social Network, but a little bit of an effort would have been nice. It seemed as the Writers were only worried about how many songs they could squeeze into the film and how many movies they could spoof off of, most notably Castaway, The Lord of the Rings, and James Bond; there's even a bit of The Jersey Shore thrown into the mix. Once you add it all up, it equates to nothing more than very lazy writing.My wife and I took our 8 year old son and 5 year old daughter with us, and although the two of them were entertained, my wife and I were both extremely disappointed. If the intent is to move forward on additional films, then the writing is going to have to improve. I find it hard to believe that after 2 movies, the writers can't come up with any original ideas. If that's the case, then I think it's time to put the film franchise back in the vault and bring the Chipmunks to Saturday morning cartoons.Grade: DPlease visit our site at www.twodudereview.com",

Dave (Jason Lee) and his arch nemesis, and previous Chipmunk manager, Ian (David Cross) inadvertently join forces to rescue them.

It really should be the death nail of the franchise, but I think they'll come up with something else in time. Still while there seems to be no real new addition (apart from one very crazy character, that just does not work in the family environment it is put in and may be a strange move by the producers to make this more accessible to grown-ups).The title pretty much gives away what you are going to see. But even with the familiar faces (or because of them) you will feel alienated. And while this still might work for most of the kids crowd this is aimed at, it also feels like an assault on your senses and your sanity. The other move to try to make the Chipmunks \"grow up\" does not work either (as portrayed here) and will surely be revised come Chipmunks 4",

I originally gave this movie 3 stars, but changed it to 4 just because I actually like those little furry guys - it's not really their fault that the writers, producers and directors made a couple of BIG mistakes during this movie. In a G movies there IS NOT supposed to be suggestive remarks or anything below the belt of ANY kind and there was three of those: #1 Dave gets hot coffee spilled on his crotch. #2 Alvis shouts \"My acorns!\" #3 Zoe says \"I just gotta wrap up my balls.\" As mentioned in another review - Zoe is the worst character and a mental case rip off from Cast away... they really blew it there, but she can dance! As also pointed out in another review - too MUCH singing with those squeaky high voices and in the wrong places. All in all the movie is okay, a bit corny and nothing I would buy on DVD. The first Alvin and the Chipmunks was original and they actually but some thought into the script, after that it went downhill with The Squeakquel where the humor was so out of place, especially with below the belt violence in the end. Chipwrecked may be a wreck, but better than the Squeakquel by far. Too bad, with a G rating I was hoping it was safe to take my girls to the movie theater - guess not.",

I can't believe the accommodations shown were actually on their ships! The plot, although thin, was still plausible and believable. The scenery on the island was lovely. The chipmunk characters were cute as usual, along with Dave. There was lots of current pop music throughout and enthusiastic dance scenes. Although I was horrified at the bad examples of behavior aboard the ship by Alvin and children passengers in the very beginning, the rest of the movie had a good moral to the story and depicted positive values for everyone. The children at the theater seemed to love it and laughed a lot. As an oldster, I enjoyed it for the most part too.",

This is our third go around with those lovable little rodents and I enjoyed it. It warmed my heart that I saw so many parents and their kids watching at the movies today because there is an important message in the film for kids. Alvin causes all kinds of mischief at the beginning and when Simon gets bit by the spider and undergoes that drastic personality change, Alvin has to take charge and get them off the island. I think that is a great message for kids that parents should discuss after they watch the film. I wanted to take the filmmakers to task on one point for their lack of originality.

            "content": "ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS: CHIPWRECKED - Rating: C+ I have been a chipmunk fan since before the Live Action films came out (I consider myself generation 2.5 being born in '95 and being a fan of both old and new). I loved the first two, Squeakuel being my favorite. But, I can't give this movie as good of a review as the other ones. The singing seemed forced and not as free flowing as what it once was. They just wanted to cram as many songs into it as possible. I didn't care for the song selection other than \"Vacation\" and \"Born this way/Ain't no Stoppin' us Now/Firework\". And it's constant singing every 5 minutes. If you like the singing part, then this will be up your alley. But, I found it exhaustive. As for the plot, I get it. But, there was much to be desired. It's too short, and there's not a lot to it at all. It also seemed a LOT more serious than the other movies. It's supposed to be in the \"CGI/Live Action Family Comedy\" genre, but there's not a lot of real \"funny\" parts except a few attempts to throw in humor from other movies and videos (Even some from youtube)********SPOILERS******** Alvin is being Alvin again in the beginning. But that's pretty much it. The plot was quite predictable. There was too much foreshadowing. If they wanted to improve the story, add some suspense and then we'll talk. After the Chipmunks & Chipettes were stranded, things went for the worse. The way everyone's personality was changed wasn't the best idea for the plot, and it really changed the outlook on the movie. Because of the personality change, things became too obvious. After the cave was found and the volcano became active, the plot was laid down right in front of you and you knew instantly that there was going to be a race against time dealing with the treasure. It became obvious that Zoe instantly that Zoe was crazy looking for the treasure and that she would do something stupid to get it. Personally, I found her just to be another random person that they added just to stretch time.I understand that the movie was made for a younger crowd, but I still am a true chipmunk fan. I just can't come to truly love the movie like the previous ones. My advice, if you didn't care for the previous movies, don't waste the money. If you are a die hard fan, then it may be worth renting for a day just to see it (Redbox is only 1.20 after all) It's not the worst, but it's a far cry from the best.",

            "content": "-- www.Ramascreen.com --Those adorable singing chipmunks are back! I grew up watching the cartooon show on re-runs when I was a kid and I enjoyed the first film but the previous installment was a mess in my book. This one, however, ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS: CHIP-WRECKED is a fun family adventure film. It's the usual chaos and mayhem with an exciting story and hilarious sense of humor. What if you introduced another side of the chipmunks that you wouldn't expect them to have?! That's the main attraction, this film is about growing up and being independent and also about the trust and responsibility that come with growing up and being independent..Don't dismiss this film as just something only young viewers or kids would enjoy, I think the film will also charm and entertain young adults, adults, and parents because the humor and especially the song selection in ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS movies have references to today's pop culture, it even pokes fun at Lord of The Rings, the film Cast Away, and the original James Bond. Think familiarity meets nostalgia. It's not Alvin And The Chipmunks movie if they don't sing or perform some of today's most popular hits from such artist as Lady Gaga to Willow Smith. This installment is way catchier and funnier than its predecessors. This is after all, the season of musical non-human characters, like Happy Feet 2 and The Muppets and I think ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS: CHIP-WRECKED is strong enough to face the competition.I really appreciate the fact that ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS: CHIP-WRECKED is not just gimmick, I appreciate the fact that the film actually has a story that works. The whole thing is more or less a chipmunked Lord Of The Flies but as I said earlier you get to be introduced to new sides of the characters. All of a sudden, Alvin who usually plays by his own rules, is forced to be the responsible one, Simon who's brilliant and uptight is now daring, spontaneous and oddly enough French, Theodore who's the naive and innocent one now finds himself adjusting to an environment that's out of his comfort zone, similar changes happen to the chippettes. All of them are now out of their element and they discover that there's more to themselves than what they've always perceived themselves.A lot of people find the chipmunks' voices annoying, there's not much that I or anyone could do about that, I mean,.. those high pitched voices are their trademark anyway. I suppose it's a matter of whether or not you grew up with them, as I did, or if you've grown accustomed to hearing them after the previous films. For this one, they brought in director Mike Mitchell who helmed Shrek Forever After which I thought was a nice ending to a saga that didn't always deliver. I don't know if ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS: CHIP-WRECKED would be the final one of this franchise but I think Mitchell tackled the story, the relationships and the theme quite well, and so if this is an ending, then it's definitely a good one.Meanwhile, Dave (Jason Lee), without planning it, spends time with his enemy from the first film, Ian (David Cross) who wears bird suit through the entire movie. And they argue about parenting and when can one parent let their kids start being independent. But it's not all dramatic, the humor is there and it's consistent. But that's the main theme in this film, a theme that I think kids and parents would be able to relate to. If there's one thing that I don't find quite satisfying about this installment is that there's not one big villain. The story does have a nutcase castaway obsessed with finding the island's treasure but in the end, everyone plays nice. Because the film is about going into adulthood, there are scenes in the film, particularly the ones in the cruise ship that may borderline adult-centric but the film never hits any type of provocative line whatsoever, it remains an exciting, fun family adventure film.-- www.Ramascreen.com --",

            "content": "Alvin's shenanigans have gotten The Chipmunks into plenty of trouble before, but when Dave takes the 'Munks and their female counterparts The Chipettes on a cruise, Alvin's horseplay goes completely overboard - literally. Stranded on a remote island, stomachs growl and tensions flare as The Chipmunks and Chipettes struggle to adapt to life without their usual creature comforts. Chipwrecked begins abruptly. There's no semblance of a back story or attempt at character introduction. Critics may see this as a cinematic faux pas, but these are established characters and if you can't deduce that they must board a ship in order to eventually be \"Chipwrecked\", maybe something a little less plot-centric would be a better choice for you. A Chipette rendition of the Go-Go's \"Vacation\" sets the scene and is the first of a fast and furious onslaught of songs. Musical numbers are better integrated in Chipwrecked than its predecessor The Squeakuel. Chipwrecked spares us from characters bursting into song or brief snippets of tracks squeezed in merely to secure a place on the movie's soundtrack.The story moves quickly. After their unintentional departure from the ship, the result of one of Alvin's hair-brained schemes, we begin to see different sides of the Chipmunks' personalities as their relationships are put to the test. Alvin emerges as an unlikely worry-wart, taking on the task of keeping morale up and organizing the group's efforts to stay fed and sheltered. Simon undergoes a Peter Parker-like transformation when he suffers a venomous spider bite and transmogrifies into a free- spirited playboy with a French accent. His charms coax Jeanette out of her shell, leaving Brittany incensed that her sister is getting so much attention. The usually bashful Theodore is also encouraged by Simon (who now refers to himself as \"Simone\") to try bungee jumping and later invite Eleanor to dance. The previously ignorable Eleanor spends much of Chipwrecked on the sidelines, having suffered a sprained ankle, until she emerges as a heroine at the film's climax, leading the group to Jeanette, who has been 'munk-napped by Zoe. Ahh, yes. Zoe. The real wild card of the movie is the new human character whose origin is somewhat mysterious. She claims to have been stranded when her UPS cargo plane crashed (a spoof of the Tom Hanks film Castaway) but emerges as a potential villain when it is revealed she came to the island seeking a lost treasure. She is neither a help nor a hindrance for much of the story but makes for better laughs than the bumbling Toby in Squeakuel. As original characters go, she's probably the best yet, aside perhaps from Claire Wilson in 2007's Alvin and the Chipmunks. Critics have raked Chipwrecked over the coals while fans graded it an A- on the site Yahoo! Movies. It still holds the #3 spot at the box office and has grossed almost $100 million. I think the question to ask yourself before seeing this movie is \"am I a fan or am I a critic?\" Chipwrecked is funny. Most of its laughs are references to pop-culture, including viral internet videos, one-liners from other movies (Castaway, James Bond), and even a Sarah Palin joke. The Chipmunks ARE a pop- culture reference and always have been. But the characters play on each other as well, and the scenarios themselves are funny on their own. One of my favorite laughs is when, after starting a fire, The Chipmunks wonder what to do next. Alvin shrugs and proceeds to lead the gang in a round of \"Kumbaya\". The 2007 Chipmunk movie was full or subtle humor and a little of that has been revived in Chipwrecked.The entire pace of the movie feels just a little too fast. Songs, although well integrated, do come quickly at first. There are no less than three full-blown musical numbers in the first ten minutes, plus another song from the soundtrack playing as background music. Character development feels rushed at times too, such as when Simon is compelled to rescue Jeanette but simply declares he \"can't do it\". Moments later he swings to the rescue on a vine. Ian Hawke's redemption of sorts is also awkward and somewhat inexplicable after being a villain for so long, and Zoe is quickly forgiven for 'munk-napping Jeanette. Chipwrecked squeezes a lot of story and action in to 87 minutes and it's definitely a tight fit.I found two other things strange about the movie. One is that there is almost no implication of peril at being dumped into the middle of the ocean. I also found the movie somewhat insensitive to heavyset people. At one point, Alvin trades a plateful of donuts to a husky boy in exchange for his toy. Ian also refers to Theodore and Eleanor as the \"chubby one\" and \"girl chubby one\" and implies that they are uninteresting.Chipwrecked works because it doesn't try to be a bigger movie than it is. It's a \"threequel\", and a kid's movie. It manages to be endearing without being sickly-sweet. The animation looks great. At times I thought the Chipmunks' movements were a little too jerky and quick, but it still looks better than the first two films. The characters are expressive and interact seamlessly with their environment. There are plenty of laughs. More sophisticated humor wouldn't appeal to the younger crowd, and would probably seem out of place to the adults in the room. The Chipmunks are a pop-culture litmus but are hardly one trick ponies. Each has their own identity and their antics supply plenty of unique humor on their own. Chipwrecked may be the movie critics love to hate, but the rest of us could do a lot worse.",

I want to start off by saying that I think people are taking this movie way too serious! The \"imdb\" final ratings(as of now) of this movie is 3.4 out of 10. This movie was not that bad. For one this is a kids movie and two what are you expecting from this movie? What you should expect from this movie is Alvin somehow getting all the other chipmunks in trouble and Dave finding a way to save them. And that pretty much what happens in this movie. Let's keep in mind that what was once a thirty minute cartoon is now being turned into a movie.I tell you what I really like about this movie. I like how they keep the musical theme in the movie. If you can remember when you were younger. The chipmunks had musicals throughout the cartoon series. So its nice that they incorporated that into the movie. Plus, it was nice that they incorporated songs that people were familiar with so people could kind of sing a long and enjoy the movie in that way. I like how the plot simply involves Alvin getting the other chipmunks into trouble and Dave or Simon has to find a way to get them all out. I'm not sure if you should expect anything else.I tell what I wasn't feeling about the movie. I thought they could have came up with a better theme for the movie as a whole. I felt like something a little less dramatic, besides them ending up on a deserted island would have been fine. At times I did feel like the movie was a little rushed. They could have also dumped the guy with the chicken suit. I felt like there was no need to have him as an antagonist in this film. I think being on a deserted island is antagonistic enough.At any rate, these are hard movie to rate. You kind of don't want to put it on the same level as certain movies and you also don't want to down grade it too much. I'm giving this movie a 7 out of 10. If you have kids and they love Alvin and the Chipmunks, definitely see this movie. If your grown and you just wondering if you should check it out. I don't see a problem with that. I'm going to say that you can wait for Redbox or Netflix's if you low on cash.",

It let's emotional scenes grow and allow time for them to breathe and the comedy is edited very snappily and it all blends together seamlessly. The attention to detail in the animation is superb and the subtlety in the voice acting really gives an art-house buff like me really something to chew on. And the cinematography, capturing beautiful strokes of scenery, and the direction that really captures tone and every shot is set up so masterfully it's reminiscent of Michael Haneke. It also has the wonder and magic of Spielberg and the blending of CG and practical effects has not been as impactive since Jurassic Park. The emotional punches hit also and gives off such visceral and raw emotion you feel like you are standing with the Chipmunks. The characterisation is superb, with a fantastic screenplay slowly revealing characters nuances quietly so you are always engrossed in the characters and relationships and the story while intricate with hidden metaphors, also is a great platform for the characters to show their traits during stressful situations. I think the only flaw with this film is that you have to pay close attention to get the full experience so I would recommend only hardcore film buffs to watch this film as it is an essential piece of cinema, more impactive than the Godfather and more intricate and intellectually mature since Synecdoche, New York. A masterpiece of art-house cinema and I highly recommend. 10/10",

In fact, the Squeakuel had been on constant replay on Star Movies over these holidays. I have had enough of their naughty and sassy squeaky voices! Curiously, the kids still wanted to watch this so I also did, albeit grudgingly. What should have been a pleasant \"family\" cruise with Dave and the Chipmunks and the Chippettes becomes a disaster because of Alvin's mischief with a kite (what else?) Everybody gets accidentally whisked off the ship and later marooned on a deserted island. There we see scenes rehashed off Tarzan, Castaway and even Raiders of the Lost Ark! Then, enter a volcanic eruption and a treasure hunter to provide thrills. Of course, in the end, everybody gets back to dry land safe and sound, as expected.OK, the Chipmunks and the Chippettes are cute, but that is about it. The pop songs chosen were not too well-rendered. The comedy of the story line was lame and painfully cheesy and corny. Jason Lee is just sleepwalking though his portrayal of Dave. David Cross was in a dreadful feathery pelican costume the entire film. This is strictly for young kids. Adults who get dragged into this by their kids should just grin and bear it, and find that silver lining, how ever thin it is.",

            "content": "I'm a huge fan of the 80s Chipmunks, even though I didn't grow up with them and I got to know them with the 2007 live action movie. \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" (1983-1990) is certainly a clever cartoons series and it doesn't treat children like idiots. The characters are also cool and adorable at the same time. However, this movie is pretty disappointing. I think there are three big problems that make this movie unbearable for adults to watch: 1) The human actors don't give a **** about the movie and their acting is really bored and they look annoyed and frustrated all the time. Plus, the first 20 minutes of the movie don't help either: the humans all act like clowns. 2) Alvin: in the 80 series he was a mischievous kid, but at the end of the day, he had a heart of gold. In this movie, he's an annoying rat that makes lame jokes and annoys everyone. 3) The story isn't really new or original and they should have given some character development to Zoe (the new character who lives in an island). She's evil and after a while, she becomes good... too cheesy.But there're also good things in the movie: Simon, Theodore and the Chipettes. They're nice and they do some funny things while they're stuck in the island. The songs are average, I really missed the day when the Chipmunks had their OWN original songs and they didn't only make covers.Don't watch this movie unless you're under 8 or you're a huge chipmunk fan.",

It's a great and funny comedy where Alvin and the gang are lost in a deserted island and Ian and Dave must save them without getting into trouble. I don't care what the critics are saying, but if you're a Chipmunks fan, go see the movie!

            "content": "Looking back, I was never really a fan of \"Alvin And The Chipmunks\". It turns out their TV show was made none other than DHX Media, which until MLPFIM didn't have a cartoon that was really considered a classic. There's nothing wrong with it, there was just a lot of better stuff out there. The fact that they keep making these movies over and over and they keep getting worse is what really annoys me. The most fun thing about this was movie was learning how David Cross had so much fun mocking this (and the other films) so much. He's a funny guy and doesn't deserve to spend an entire movie in a pelican suit, or half a pelican suit I guess. It's still stupid.This gets worse than the previous entries because it didn't even introduce any important element from Alvin and the Chipmunks. The previous two, while still bad, at least introduced the title characters and the Chipettes, respectively. This is all completely pointless and might have worked as like a really short film. It does nothing to add to the little mythology this franchise even has. Cross told people not to see it, but at least it wasn't as awful as \"An Alsn Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn!\" which I still consider one of the most unpleasant experiences in my entire life. The CGI isn't that good and everything is so predictable. When the stranded woman said there were others, I knew she'd be referring to inanimate objects. I knew Simon would save Janet in the end. Even at its fairly short length, it still seems needlessly padded. There's tons of pop culture songs. I guess it's justified given how they're singers in universe, but it's still a needless way to become relevant.There's a scene at the end where Alvin flashes to signal a rescue helicopter. It then cuts to him at a concert. Then we see some credits and then it shows this pointless part on an airplane. When is this even taking place? Right between the concert? It's all a waste of time as most live-action adaptations. I heard this won the best movie at the Kid's Choice Awards. I guess it actually beat \"Twilight: Breaking Dawn - Part 1\"'s record for least critically acclaimed film to win movie of the year at any awards show (for them it was the MTV Movie Awards). Your kids deserve better and so do you. *1/2",

A MIRACLE! When the chipmunks and the chipettes teamed up together to sing Bad Romance, i felt that in my soul. There was a warmness within me. All of the characters bring something to the story. The sub plot where Simon became sexy was so unique, it was so fresh, it changed me. The plot twist when Zoe was evil? PEOPLE DIED. LIVES WERE CHANGED. NO ONE WAS THE SAME EVER AGAIN! YOU CANNOT CLAIM TO BE A \"filmbro\" IF YOU NEVER WATCHED THE MASTERPIECE THAT IS CHIPWRECKED! You know what? Lets expand. Alvin and the Chipmunks is the best FRANCHISE in all of cinema!

            "content": "As an \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" fan, I believe that this franchise has a lot of potential, yet unfortunately is being poorly written, directed and produced (No offence). I get the impression that the film crew working on this franchise are just creating them to get them out of the way, and not paying attention to detail, or anything of this matter.Action-wise, this franchise is a little on the disappointing side. Sure, there were damsels in distress and a moment of fear evident in the characters' eyes, however, none that would compel you to want to talk about it over and over. These are children's films, I get that, but there are a fair few of individuals older than a child whom are fans as well, and would like to be really up on the edge of that seat. Franchises like \"Ice Age\" or \"Shrek\" are rated PG, they make you wonder what's going to happen next, surprise you when a character is faced with life-threatening situations, but then still gives you that good old happy ending, and you leave the theatre feeling pleasantly satisfied. The \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" franchise has a lot of potential, however it hasn't exactly met its mark just yet, action-wise. Also, I saw an extreme alteration in the character Ian Hawke's personality. I enjoyed him on screen during the first instalment of \"Alvin and the Chipmunks,\" however, when he just so \"happened\" to be working as entertainment (Chipwrecked) on the exact same cruise Dave and the chipmunks and the chipettes were on, acting like he had truly lost his marbles and felt a little out of place gave me a bit of a bad impression on the film. To add to this, it felt as though all Dave and Ian were doing throughout the ENTIRE duration of Chipwrecked was arguing and looking for the chipmunks and the chipettes. They didn't really play a very significant role in the third instalment at all. This other character didn't seem very special either; Zoe, the strange yet quirky castaway (or as we find out towards the end, a \"Pirate\") the chipmunks and the chipettes ran into on the island. She seemed as though she was just created to 'be there', all happy and lively, and then go nuts when suddenly finding out (by 'Simone') there really was gold on the island, that she'd been looking for for nine, or it could be eight years. She didn't really have a back story, besides the fact that she so happened to come across a real treasure map and was more determined than ever to find it when \"they\" told her she was crazy and said the map was fake. There also was no story behind the treasure map or how the gold was embedded there; did it just happen to be there?",

This is a really good CGI animation effort, bringing the chipmunks to life and making them look more closely to real life chipmunks. This trilogy really gets funny, crazy and more interesting as it goes on. Although it may be flawed (Ian's role is reduced significantly here due to him being in a pelican suit for the entire film and i also felt that Zoe's role is unnecessary) it really does have an important message: about growing up. Most of these reviews are way too serious, just soften a little and stop hating them. They are cutely animated to look as real as possible. Justin, Matthew and Jesse, Christina, Anna and Amy as well as Jason lee shine as the main characters. I like how the chipmunks rocked the boat (LITERALLY!!) and ended p as castaways. Though much of this film's plot was recycled from Cast Away, Lord of the Flies (1990) and the ocean survival of Life of Pi (2012) it's overall great family fun and freshly squeezed comedy!!!!",

Two years ago, I showed no mercy to \"Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel.\" This year, I'm faced with \"Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked.\" I didn't feel the intense dislike I felt for the previous film. Instead, I went through all of its eighty-seven minutes with numb indifference. That's because this time, I recognized it was made for really young children. There's no complicated plot, no deep character development, no messages that haven't already been delivered; it's simply a bright, colorful, goofy, innocent film. Indeed, it's the first of the series to receive a G rating. I guess this means no more jokes about eating your brother's accidental defecation and pretending it's a raisin.Parents, be forewarned: There are precious few jokes included for your enjoyment. I will do you the favor of not spoiling the two I took notice of (if there are any jokes I forgot about, well, you can consider it a bonus). You deserve at least that much if you plan on taking your children, who I'm sure you love dearly, to see it. 99.9% of this movie is made for them and them only. They will respond to the bold colors, the lighthearted physical gags, and the cuteness of the title characters, all computer-generated rodents with fluffy cheeks, little twitchy noses, big expressive eyes, and adorable helium voices. The same applies for their female counterparts, the Chipettes, who were introduced in the second chapter and are now a part of the formula. If your children actually learn the film's good-natured lessons in responsibility, growth, trust, forgiveness, and redemption, look up into the sky and thank your lucky stars.Here's the story. The Chipmunks \u2013 Alvin (voiced by Justin Long), Simon (voiced by Matthew Gray Gubler), and Theodore (voiced by Jesse McCartney) \u2013 along with the Chipettes \u2013 Brittany (voiced by Christina Applegate), Jeanette (voiced by Anna Faris), and Eleanor (voiced by Amy Poehler) \u2013 and their human adoptive father, Dave Seville (Jason Lee), board a cruise ship for a vacation. Alvin, who feels babied, rebels against Dave's rules by being a troublemaking daredevil. Unfortunately, his antics get all six chipmunks in hot water; the kite they were riding, initially for fun, breaks loose and goes flying out to sea. It isn't long before they find themselves stranded on a tropical island. They meet a stranded young woman named Zoe (Jenny Slate), who claims to have been there for eight or nine years. No one really knows how she got there, but it's strongly suggested that she's a few coconuts short of a palm tree.As they struggle to survive in the wild, Simon will get bitten by a spider. Its venom doesn't kill him, although it does make him think he's a thrill-seeking, passionately romantic Frenchman named Simone, with extra emphasis on the \"-one.\" For the time being, he's no longer the uptight, brainy one of the group. Theodore, always the more timid of the Chipmunks, will take the first steps towards loosening up and having a little fun. The biggest surprise is Alvin, who begins to act responsibly for the first time in his life. When Brittany tells him that he's starting to sound like Dave, all strict and fatherly-like, he can only look up and let out a long, agonized, highly theatrical, \"Noooooooooooooooooo!\"Meanwhile, Dave has gotten himself stranded on the same island, as he went overboard when he saw the Chipmunks flying away on the kite. Quite by accident, someone came along with him. Here reenters Ian Hawke (David Cross), the former record producer who now works as a mascot for the cruise ship. He spends just about the entire film dressed in a duck costume, blaming Dave for his botched opportunities with both the Chipmunks and the Chipettes. In a hopelessly na\u00efve display of transcendence that wore itself out twenty years ago on episodes of \"Full House,\" we watch Ian instantaneously shift from cruel and greedy towards ... not complete selflessness, but certainly into a much kinder person. Will they find all six chipmunks before the volcano in the center of the island erupts?The children who see this movie will probably laugh at Zoe and her collection of sports balls, all of which she talks to and has supplied with smiley faces and names. They're unlikely, however, to know that this is a reference to Robert Zemeckis' \"Cast Away.\" That was released in 2000, which is a good seven or eight years before the target audience was born. They're much more likely to respond to the numerous scenes of the Chipmunks and Chipettes singing, even though only some of the songs are current pop standards. In the course of \"Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,\" we will hear samples of \"Vacation,\" \"Bad Romance,\" \"Born This Way,\" \"Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now,\" \"Survivor,\" \"Conga,\" and \"Firework.\" Will they actually take notice of the film's more compelling aspects, like Alvin inching ever closer towards maturity? There are some things even I don't know the answer to.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",

Maybe it will play better on DVD. But for the first time ever I swear, I was actually bored of the movie about halfway through. I had seen the original first movie and the second one and they were okay.This third one, in my opinion, was just a money grabbing machine. I mean, the songs were good but most of the movie was on the island and there wasn't anything interesting that happened. There were many movie references that were funny, but for the most part it was just an excuse for a third movie, which of course disappoints.Anyway, I'll give them a little credit for trying and for doing well with the animation, but I have to rate this 4/10.",

It's terrible; it has some of the usual problems of many sequels, the CGI is not up to today's standards, and (surprise, surprise) the plot is lame and predictable. It could be even worse, hence the two-star rating, rather than one, but it's a real waste of effort. I had not seen the previous Alvin and the chipmunk movies, and I was a bit lost given that viewers were assumed to know not only the chipmunk characters but also some of the others. When the 'bad guy' from a previous movie was revealed, it was unclear to me why he was such a bad guy. It remained somewhat unclear even when he turned into one of the 'good guys' at the end. And if his switch wasn't abrupt enough, what about the change of heart shown by the girl who'd been searching for treasure? But even from the beginning the characters were unbelievable - from the moment at the very beginning when they were walking towards the ship and I kept wondering \"what is he looking at?\" Pathetic.",

            "content": "Before I start, I'd just like to say how awful it is reading all the nasty comments from many IMDb members about Mike Mitchell's \"Chipwrecked\". The majority of members and users of this site are in fact adults whose reviews and ratings you have read show personal distaste to a film aimed to the age group of young children. It's no surprise that they didn't enjoy it as much as they should have! As a teenager, I had the pleasure of taking my three younger siblings to the cinemas to see Chipwrecked. They had all been, and I along with them to see the previous movies in the sequel and were so excited for this one. For me, I had absolutely loved the first film in the sequel, Alvin and the Chipmunks when I went to see it as a 10-year-old in 2006. The storyline and characters were excellent and it has become one of my favorites right up to this day, seeing it about ten times on DVD. Last year, I found the 2nd movie to the sequel a total disappointment with its poor plot and lack of interest compared to the previous film.However, I found Chipwrecked pleasantly enjoyable and I have to also say that this movie was better that the first two with the storyline of the playful chipmunks being shipwrecked on a deserted island. This time, Dave (Jason Lee), the loving and caring human father of the chipmunks is back which he for some reason disappeared in the 2nd movie. That main highlight of Chipwrecked, the 3 chipmunks and chipettes were really interesting due to their character development; Simon who suddenly turns into a Frenchman, Alvin who changes his usual fun and outgoing attitude to becoming more responsible and Brittany who becomes smart. There is also another person marooned on the island, Zoe (Jenny Slate) who might be just a little different to a normal person. Thee antagonist of the sequel, Ian (David Cross) is also back as a member of the shipwrecked part and this time he shows an interesting good side to him. Chipwrecked is also a good laugh for the audience containing many jokes and funny scenes with the chipmunks as well as great songs to which they sing too (Lady Gaga, Beyonc\u00e9, Willow Smith, Katy Perry, etc) . The singing was great and really enjoyable although I wish each song was longer that just the chorus. Who doesn't like singing and dancing chipmunks? In conclusion, all children (and maybe a few adults) will love Chipwrecked with the cute and adorable chipmunks characters, great storyline, funny jokes and great singing.",

I watch a lot of different titles with them, over and over again because they like them enough. This is one movie I am grateful that they didn't like because honestly, there is no way I could sit through this movie again.

As other reviewers have mentioned, there is probably more singing than necessary and it does get a bit grating. However, having said that, the kids enjoyed all the singing. Heck, they even sort-of liked Zoe. As an adult it was less cringe-worthy that I was expecting, though genuine laughs were scarce. A lot of the references to other movies were lost on the kids - perhaps because many were movies they had not yet seen due to their age (the children) and the movie ratings.If you like the previous two movies, and you're an adult, this one is bearable when watched with young kids. Watching their reactions will provide your entertainment. However, I'm not holding my breath for the DVD release.",

It is a light-hearted family fun movie that I can see children and their parents watching together. In the second movie, it can be seem with the arrival of the Chippettes that they admired the Chipmunks but not much was implied there. But this movie, it explores the romance with a pair which was definitely interesting to watch. Also the groups dynamics while stuck on the island with responsibilities and silly actions. I quite enjoy the movie myself, it was entertaining and fun to watch and doesn't deserve severely bad ratings. Watch the trailer and decide on your own if you will be watching it.

He shows this fear due to Toby telling him his family would die if an eagle picked up the chipmunks accidentally scaring him. Theodore becomes obsessed with meerkats and thinks that he should live with meerkats due to him being body shamed and thinks he doesn't fit in. Brittany is a great character because she shows she cares about her sisters and believes no one should be a lead but all of them are lead singers but Ian doesn't approve and influences her to be a leader practically forcing her to be a lead singer. Overall this movie didn't deserve the ratings it got. Alvin the Chipmunks: the Squeakquel was not a hidden gem but a hidden diamond. I think that since this movie was made for kids critics didn't really pay attention to the movie and gave it a bad rating because it's Alvin and the Chipmunks.

I actually liked this better than the Squeakal. It compares to the first film in quality, only this one doesn't have that holiday motif. A goo fun film for the whole family. The soundtrack is entertaining, with mash ups combining songs you would've never imagined would go together. Who would've ever thought in 2011, Gloria Estefan's Conga would be remixed with a remixed version of an old Italian song? In this movie we watch the Chipmunks stranded on an island. Granted the things they construct out of bamboo and coconuts make Gilligan's Island seem realistic--but then again, this is a movie about a man who is raising six talking chipmunks as children. They even pay homage to \"Cast Away\" (2000). Simon's transformation into \"Simone\" is entertaining, but was this perhaps an attempt at competing with \"Puss 'n boots\" (2011)? Interesting nonetheless. This movie is fun to watch.",

Either way though, this movie is terrible, so stay away. Ps- parents, if you're going to have a family movie night, be sure to make the flick an old 90s Disney and Hayao Miyazaki film. Ok.

            "content": "My name is Anthony Aranda from Kids First!  and I am reviewing a really funny movie called \u00e2Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked.\u00e2? This was awesome because there is a lot of action in the movie and everything the chipmunks and Chipettes do is so funny.\nThis movie is all about Dave, the chipmunks, and the Chipettes who go on vacation and have a really big adventure. They go on a cruise ship and Alvin keeps causing lots of trouble on the ship (like always). Alvin comes up with a really great idea to fly on top of a kite. All of the chipmunks and Chipettes are holding the kite while Alvin is flying but the wind picks up too hard. They start to fly away and Simon tries to help by tying the kite to Dave\u00e2(TM)s chair (while he is sleeping). This still doesn\u00e2(TM)t work and the chair and the chipmunks start to move down the deck of the ship. Eventually, the kite slips off the chair and the chair flips over. Dave wakes up to see the chipmunks and the Chipettes fly away on the kite.\nSome of the main characters in the movie are Dave, the chipmunks (Alvin, Simon, and Theodore), the Chipettes (Eleanor, Jeanette, and Brittany), Zoe, and Ian. My favorite character is Alvin because he is always having fun and causing lots of trouble. I also like him because in the end he learns that he can still have fun while being responsible.\nMy favorite part in the movie is when the chipmunks and Chipettes meet Zoe on the stranded island. She invites them to meet her friends and when they get there they see that her friends are a bunch of sports balls.  It\u00e2(TM)s really funny because it seems like she is a little crazy since she has been on the island for so long. We figure out later that there are spiders on the island that change a person\u00e2(TM)s personality and make them act differently. Later in the movie Simon gets bit by one of the spiders and then he starts acting like someone else. It is really funny. \nI would recommend this movie for all ages because it is super funny and there was no violence or parts that would scare anyone. It also shows how much family means and that most families would do anything for each other.",

When Alvin's fun turns into fail, he and the other five menaces to society end up on a desert island and their adoptive father Dave (Jason Lee) and arch nemesis Ian Hawke (David Cross) looking for them, for opposite reasons, obviously.\r\n\r\nAfter suffering through the first two \"munkin'\" annoying pictures, I cringed at the first feeling of renting this one, but I did and I want my money back. Honestly, how could any human being actually LIKE this franchise. It boggles the munkin' mind.\r\n\r\nI admit that at first Alvin, Simon and Theodore were cute in the first movie, but they went from cute, to tolerable, to completely annoying. I'd like to see a fourth movie... when they get rabies and die.\r\n\r\nBut I commend the series for being consistent... consistently sucking! The actors suck, the visuals suck, all but two jokes in the entire franchise (two of which are in the third movie) suck and of course kids everywhere will think that this movie sucks.\r\n\r\nThe only good thing about this movie was... it ended.\r\n\r\n1/2 out of ****\r\nFINAL VERDICT: 5%",

Any nostalgia factor towards the titular, Alvin and his cohorts has already been exposed of, and the fallout of this most gruesome of alterations is appalling to the point I dare not even gaze towards it much longer! Every nickel spent towards this waste of human thought and money brings me closer to not just a brutal display of projectile vomit, but closer to my head implanted on the pavement 3 feet deep in. Within this movie, once lovable shenanigans of our nostalgic protagonist, the ruffian but loveable Alvin, reaches a factor in which it is annoying. Due to his tomfoolery, his need to go about and shove his tuffs of fur in and about everyone's business has reached the point it insults everyone's intelligence. Their cruise, that brings us eventually to our punful shipwrecking, is annoying to the point their capers fail to bring a smile to my once gleeful face. This movie's humor consists of not just hurtful, if not racist humor situations, in which everyone acts as expected according to skin color, or, for lack of better term, fatness. Case and point, the over weight boy surrendering his kite for a plate of donuts, Alvin taking on the mannerisms expecting of a rapper type persona, and the actions of the females around the dance scene within the midst of the middle act. What kind of child friendly movie allows for such harmful ideas to be laughed along with. This is only comparable to North Korea's actions of including hurtful and spiteful lyrics within children's nurseries. This is what we're getting at America, North Korea. And Communism. As the movie goes on, we eventually leave hurtful towards out race and outward appearance, and just enter hurtful to out minds and self respect. As the film reaches it's second half, the cast of this long-derailed train finally, and I put emphasis on FINALLY, reach the promised island. The first thing we're greeted to after out journey about stereotypes, hurtful comedy, and just foolish antics that look down upon our children like a principal to a common hoodlum? Simple, a parody of LOST. Among other things, the second act of this movie proves to be almost as spiteful as the very introduction to our cast and crew. The movie continues on it's merry way of talking down to your children and you, by treating us like we're the fools, who'll laugh at any pop cultural thing brought up! My words have been hateful so far, and let me assure you, it shall continue down this slope to insanity! It shall! I shall rain down with my rage and hatred! HOW DARE CGI CHIMPMUNKS, TAKE A SMALL CHUNK OF MY WALLET, AND SWALLOW IT DOWN THEIR ANIMATED GULLETS! HOW DARE THEY DIGEST MY CURRENCY, RENDER MY VIEWING EXPERIENCE RUINED FOREVER!
