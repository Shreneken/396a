            "review_title": "A movie with absolutely no life whatsoever",
            "content": "How does a movie like Bucky Larson get made? Here is a movie that appeals to no audience I can think of, and yet it is playing on thousands of screens. The only logical explanation I can come to for this movie's existence is that Mr. Sandler has some very incriminating photos of someone at Columbia Pictures.Our title hero, Bucky (played by comedian Nick Swardson), is a dweeb. Not a funny one, or a likable one, but a pathetic dweeb who seems to live in his own world. Bucky hails from a small Midwest farm town, where he works as a bag boy at a grocery store, until he's fired about two minutes after the opening movie credits. He goes to a friend's house, where they decide to cheer him up by showing him a classic porno film starring a pair of legendary porn stars named Rosie Bush and Jim Spraysium. Seconds into watching the film, Bucky recognizes the stars as being his parents. Rather than be horrified, he is entranced by the idea that his parents were once in movies. It's at that moment he decides that it's his destiny to be a star as well, and decides to head to California and make it in \"nude movies\".Bucky arrives in Hollywood with big dreams, but seemingly little common sense, as when he auditions for a mac and cheese commercial, and immediately drops his pants and starts jerking off in front of the horrified director and casting crew. Fortunately, the director on the commercial shoot used to work in the porn business, and directs Bucky to someone who can help him. The first person Bucky meets is the porn star Dick Shadow (Stephen Dorff), who is currently the biggest thing in the movies (in more ways than one), and immediately shuns him. He's later introduced to Miles Deep (Don Johnson, looking particularly embarrassed here), a down on his luck porn director who is so desperate to make a movie, he's even willing to give Bucky a shot. The audition does not go well, as when Bucky drops his pants, his \"manhood\" is revealed to be literally microscopic. He also has a tendency to start screeching like a monkey whenever he sees a woman take her shirt off, and starts shooting off blasts of his \"man juice\" like a shotgun all over the room and ceiling.Let me stop this plot synopsis, and ask a simple question - Does this sound like a movie you would want to see? Does it even sound like a movie to begin with? I find myself returning to my original question, how does a movie like Bucky Larson get made? It holds absolutely no laughs, its lead character is an unlikable schmuck with an overbite and not a shred of knowledge of how to behave in social situations, and there's literally no plot to speak of. Just one situation after another for Bucky to humiliate himself. As the movie dragged on for nearly 100 interminable minutes, I came to realize that the entire screenplay revolves around three basic jokes. 1:) Bucky has buck teeth and talks funny. 2:) Bucky has a small dick. 3:) Bucky orgasms instantly every time he sees a woman take her shirt off. The movie repeats these same jokes many times, as if it thinks if it repeats them enough, it will wear down our defenses, and we'll eventually start laughing.Back to the plot - Bucky's disastrous audition winds up on the Internet, and becomes a sensation. This inspires Miles Deep to give the guy another chance, and come up with a new form of porn that is non-threatening to guys (because they know they're better than Bucky), and is reassuring to women, since they know they are sleeping with a better guy than Bucky. Somehow, this idea takes off, and Bucky becomes a major star in the porn industry. He even sweeps the porn film awards, which is hosted by Pauly Shore, who plays himself in a cameo. It also means that this is probably the worst movie Pauly Shore has ever appeared in. (And no, I'm not forgetting BioDome.) While all this is happening, Bucky also strikes up a relationship with a sweet young waitress named Kathy (Christina Ricci). Kathy seems like a bright young woman, and Ricci plays her with charm. So, why is she hanging around Bucky to begin with? Looking back over my review, I see that I have left very little out. This literally is all there is to the movie. There's no real conflict, other than a very halfhearted falling out between Bucky and Kathy that exists solely because the movie was nearly 90 minutes old, and nothing had really happened so far. This is nothing more than a story of an insufferable schmuck who goes to Hollywood, gets a job in porn, and falls in love with a nice girl. That's all. There's a hint of a subplot concerning the jealous porn star, Dick Shadow, trying to ruin Bucky's career. But this is so unmemorable, it could be cut from the film without anyone noticing. Why did it take three people to write a movie where virtually nothing happens? A movie that's quite clearly dead.Yes, Bucky Larson is a dead movie. It shows no signs of life or inspiration. It doesn't even have the decency to be a lively or memorable bad movie. It just sort of lies there, not doing anything, and then asks us to leave 100 minutes later. Those who know me know that I never wish ill will upon anyone, but I seriously think that a movie like this could end careers. I hope that doesn't happen. I'm sure Nick Swardson is a nice and funny guy in real life. I'm also sure he'll be apologizing for this one for a long time to come.",

            "content": "I like Nick Swardson. His show \"Pretend time\" on Comedy Central is hilarious and he's usually good in supporting roles (\"Grandma's boy\" & \"Just go with it\"). But wow, did this movie suck. \"Bucky Larson\" is flat. The jokes aren't funny and the acting for the most part is uninspired. Don Johnson was the highlight of the film and Christina Ricci did what she could but there are no redeeming qualities in this film.I went in with low expectations because of the bad reviews and word of mouth, and yet I was still disappointed. This film deserves to be in the bottom 250 on IMDb. With the talent that was involved in the project and the premise of a porn comedy, \"Bucky Larson\" should have been funny. But instead I found myself wishing it was never made. I feel sorry for the chumps who paid $10 to see this garbage in theaters.",

            "content": "...And not in a good way! I love movies, regardless of its age or genre. I love comedies and admire those with inspiration. When I saw Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star out of curiosity- though I did have reservations about seeing it starting with the trailer and Adam Sandler co-penning the script- online, I found next to nothing to love or admire about it.The film looks cheap for starters, more in the slapdash editing and cinematography and dull lighting than the scenery. The soundtrack didn't have anything I'd deem memorable. Then there is the direction. Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star has some of the worst direction I have seen in a movie in quite a while, as all the basic tools of direction like camera placement and continuity Brady seems to be ignoring here.Story-wise this just didn't engage. Some might say it is a predictable movie, in many ways yes it is. A movie that is predictable isn't bad as such, but for me it is when the film in question is not at all inspiring and just doesn't have any point to it. That for me is the case with Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star. Even worse is the writing, which is horrendous. It is not funny at all, just dumb, puerile and irritating, with no heart whatsoever.When it comes to the pace, the film has no life to it, because the dialogue and jokes are so bad(seriously the penis that was so small you could use a straw for a condom idea was incredibly stupid) and no effort is made in regards to the characters, who are little more than stiff caricatures at best. The acting is really poor, Nicky Swardson is just annoying and abrasive while Christina Ricci who I like actually is cute but bland. In fact only Don Johnson actually tries to do anything fresh with his character. As for comic timing, in regard to this film, why bother really, most of it is basically saying a line and standing around aimlessly waiting for someone to say their bit.Overall, irritating, woefully directed and pointless. Of a very hit-and-miss year so far, I think I now have my new contender for the worst of the bunch. 0/10 Bethany Cox",

            "review_title": "This should have NEVER been born.",
            "content": "There is very little to say about Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star other than \"I hated it ... I hated ALL of it!\" The film is not funny and it is repellent.I cannot criticize it for being about porn because Boogie Nights was exclusively about the world of porn and I think it was one of the BEST film of the 1990's. Boogie Nights treated its characters as flawed human beings searching for acceptance and a feeling of belonging -- Bucky Larson's characters are all supposed to be laughed at and there are just too many times throughout the movie which had me wanting to rush to the bathroom to vomit as 89% of the film is stomach-churning.This should pretty-much END the career of anybody involved and I am actually surprised that Adam Sandler's name is attached as both a writer and a producer of this trash (Sandler also gave us Jack and Jill and Just Go With It this year -- the latter film is only saved b/c of the over-the-top performance of the unlikely physical comedienne Nicole Kidman -- so I question whether or not his days are numbered?).An unfunny-to-me Nick Swardson (Just Go With It, 30 Minutes or Less, Blades of Glory) -- who's career is mostly stand-up comedy -- stars as the grotesquely buck-toothed Bucky Larson (who must've been born with buck-teeth?) who believes he is destined for a glorious career in porn after discovering his parents were au natural (meaning: unshaven, un-waxed, un-spray-tanned, un-fit etc) porn stars of the 1970's. Bucky leaves behind an insulting-to-mid-westerners existence in Iowa (only found in the movies -- he didn't attend high school because his town didn't have one ... whatever), the RIDICULOUSLY-accented Bucky (that is NOT an Iowa accent ... but let's throw-out another stupid laugh at the expense of the heartland) heads to LA where his dreams can come true.Bucky luckily meets a nice, big-hearted waitress (Christina Ricci - Sleepy Hollow, Penelope, Monster ... and after this is it any wonder she seeked out employment on television as Pan-Am is Oscar-caliber compared to this!) at a random diner who befriends him, finds him a place to live (with crazy-jerk roommate Kevin Nealon - \"SNL\", \"Weeds\", Just Go With It) and sets him in the right direction of finding work. Don Johnson (Tin Cup, Machete ... who's short-lived career rebirth must be over) is porn director Miles Deep who sees something \"special\" in Bucky and decides to exploit the freak (it's explained in the film ... but I don't recommend watching this to figure out the \"freak-tag\" that has NOTHING to do with his teeth!) and Stephen Dorff (who's stellar \"comeback\" with the excellent film Somewhere must have been a fluke!!) plays a jealous porn-star rival.As vulgar and repulsive as this film is, there is surprisingly little flesh on display. It would be difficult to pick-out the worst part of this film as that would pretty-much be the whole thing. Just as impossible would be finding \"the best\" part. This film isn't bad because it is offensive -- we've had Bridesmaids and two Hangover films -- it is just terrible bad. What works with those 3 films is that they are \"equal-opportunity offenders\" ... this one -- NOT so much. It is rank and rancid and beyond mere words for criticism. I NEVER want to see something like this again.",

It uses the same three jokes the entire movie: Bucky has buck teeth, he shoots semen at the mere sight of a naked girl, and he has a tiny penis covered with a bush of hair. Boom, that's it. That's the movie. Game over man, game over.If I could give this film zero stars, I would. Not even Stephen Dorff can save this penguin excrement.",

            "content": "This is extremely heavy stuff, made for specialists in comedy. Most people will not get Tarkovsky's The Mirror and in the same way most people will not get Bucky Larson. There are few that get The Mirror and a few that get Bucky Larson and these two groups of people do not intersect easily. I rated The Mirror, 10/10, and Bucky Larson, I rate it 9/10, the same ratings I gave for Citizen Kane, The Godfather, Rear Window, Fanny and Alexander and Vertigo.I personally think that Bucky Larson is vastly superior to most comedies. Take another random comedy, House Bunny, that was a plain bad movie but this is much more than that, if you are able to get it, of course. One needs to be able to fully master the art of watching crappy comedies before trying this kind of stuff which was made for the specialists. I have already watched hundreds of bad comedies and about 20 Adam Sandler movies and this operates on another league of greatness. I would say that I got a lot of fun from watching this impressive work of art that defies convention and goes where no other movie has gone before. It was a \"bad movie\" done entirely on purpose by the director and writers. Just like the porn movies Bucky made in the movie, this is innovation and film critics, people who were brainwashed in film school to like 1940's stuff, cannot simply understand the genius of this film, as did the people on the porn business which were shown Bucky film's.My ratings would be:9/10 - Specialists 0/10 - Most peopleI wouldn't recommend this movie for regular people. They will not understand it.",

            "content": "I'm totally confused. I'm completely lost. Did the world famous \"Jack and Jill\" (co-writer) Adam Sandler and Going-Nowhere-Fast Nick Swardson INTENTIONALLY set out to make the world's worst comedy?Seriously. Think about it. The horribly clich\u00e9d and unoriginal Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star was so god-awful and incredibly offensive with its decades-old bad stereotypes it was flat-out unfunny. In fact, if you dare, watch it with the sound off and turn on the 24/7 Comedy IHEARTRADIO Station. At least you'll laugh for 90 minutes. It may even coincide with the scenes on the screen.I used to like Swardson, especially as Terry on Reno 911! But, damn, ever since then \u2013 Just Go With It, 30: Minutes or Less, Jack and Jill \u2013 c'mon now. Enough is enough. I understand most of his \"appearances\" take place because he's in bed with Adam Sandler and it's no secret I loathe that whiney little man, but this feature length, his first, I believe, is just a tragedy. That all said, the worst offender was Christina Ricci. YOU'RE BETTER THAN THIS AND YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF!Ah-hem, I'm calm now. Where was I? Bucky is a buck-toothed (ha, get it? Really?) son of two 70s porn stars and heads to Hollywood to become one himself. His only gift is that he makes other small-penis guys feel better about themselves. Oh, and an outrageously blind girl (Ricci) falls for him.The movie, which in reverse, wouldn't even work as a 5-minute SNL sketch. Hell, it doesn't work as a comedy, spoof, drama or a relevant piece of farce in 2011. I'm seriously considering adding a \"\u00bd Star to 0 Stars\" to my rating board, if it weren't actually professionally shot. Sure, it wasn't amateurishly made, but that's like buying an old Ford Pinto and when people's eyes turn away, you say: \"Hey, it runs!\"I don't normally focus on Box Office Receipts for movies, because they can go either way in regards to quality and money made \u2013 note: the Twilight series, but just for shits and giggles, I looked it up: $1.4 million opening weekend and $2.5 overall. That's a lot more than I imagined. And more than this is worthy of. (It did, however, open at #15 behind The Smurfs. Please, PLEASE, Adam & Nick, see this as a sign not everything you touch turns to gold.)One final note to end these rants: My prayer is that Adam Sandler is done soon. I know he'll dish 'em out as long as he has an audience dumb enough to pay his salary, but I do pray he has a Mel Gibson rant and disappears. He'll still have all the money he didn't deserve, but at least he'll go away. Nick, on the other hand, his days HAVE to be numbered. Even Adam isn't as stupid as to keep him under his wing. Or is he?",

It may have been because it was released in the beginning of September, when there are few people going to movie theaters. It may have been because the movie is about the porn industry, which has never been a popular movie topic for mainstream moviegoers. It may have also been because the relentless television commercials for the movie were very annoying. But I think the main reason why it bombed was that the audience smelled it for the stinker that it was. There are no laughs anywhere to be found in the movie, for one thing. But it also has a weird tone, like it was written by a dirty-minded and mean-spirited eight year old. It's not very audience-friendly, to put it mildly. The cast is spirited, but they can do absolutely nothing with the terrible script.Oh, one more piece of evidence for its badness: The end credits for this 2011 release list a 2010 copyright, suggesting that Columbia Pictures didn't know what to do with the movie for quite some time.",

There are some genuine laugh out loud moments in this movie IF it's your sense of humour. If it isn't, then why are you watching it? Sandler isn't exactly world renowned for his subtlety or his sensitive handling of subject matter. He has a team of friends around him who obviously get together over a few drinks and spin out some ideas that make them laugh. I like that about him. And I always get the impression that everybody making one of his movies has a real laugh doing it. And that's what I'm after when I'm watching one.

I couldn't stop laughing when I first saw his face and the bucked teeth with bowl cut. Coming in to this movie you knew it wasn't meant to be taken seriously. If you can't handle comedies that are stupid and funny you should avoid them. I think the people giving Buck Larson a 1/10 were the same ones giving Warrior 10 and comparing it to Rocky, but let's stick to the review anyways. With Happy Madison movies it's either always a hit or miss. I think Sandler gave us another great dark comedy that will be loved by a small group of people, and hated by most. The dark humour in Bucky Larson is very dirty, so be prepared for that. I think it appeals to mostly men who are 18-35. If you saw Grandmas Boy that would be the best way I could describe the very dark humour of this movie. I was disappointed Allen Covert didn't have a bigger role in Bucky Larson but im sure Sandler has other plans for him. At the end of the day this was Swardson at his absolute best. Christina Ricci also did a great job with the role she was given. Stephen Dorff was good as always, but Kevin Nealon (bull dance guy from Happy Gilmore) had me in tears. I have never heard him swear before so when he goes off it's priceless and unexpected. I think Bucky Larson Born To Be A Star deserves an 8/10 and it's unfortunate that people these days can't handle a great comedy just because it's dirty. No dirty isn't the word for it, this movie is filthy. I am laughing again just thinking about the concept. At least Sandler gave us something really filthy for a change, finally back to his roots.",

While I wouldn't consider this one of the worst in my opinion, I can see exactly why the film was hated by so many. The writing simply is awful....with not even a single laugh in the movie even though it's supposed to be a comedy. Instead of humor, the film resorts to crudeness. Crude CAN be funny....such as the cute film \"Stepbrothers\". But crude with no humor whatsoever is simply annoying and boorish....and this film has that in spades.Bucky (Nick Swardson) is a guy from Iowa who is intensely stupid as well as possessing teeth like Bugs Bunny.....a joke that wears thin very quickly. After discovering that his parents used to be porn stars, instead of being repulsed or embarrassed, he thinks it's cool. So, his folks encourage him to trek to California to be a part of the porn industry. Hillarity SHOULD ensue...but it doesn't.Unfunny, very crude and ample evidence that Adam Sandler (yes, THAT Adam Sandler) should not write films. Overall, an unfunny and disgusting film that held no interest at all to me as I tried to watch. I could mention all the various offensive things featured in the film...but I am pretty sure IMDB would not allow me to mention them.",

            "content": "I admire Swardson's defense for this film because I imagine it was an unbelievable challenge to market. Here we have a character, unseen anywhere else, played by a second rate actor who hasn't quite made a household name yet. To market an unknown character with antics like the ones present in this movie isn't as much hard as it is devotion. To go through with a project of this magnitude means you must have a lot of faith in the material.In Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star, there is no faith, hope, wit, soul, or even a sign that this was taken to a remote extent of seriousness. All the actors seem to be laughing at their own joke shamelessly - nearly all of them equally unfunny and sad. Adam Sandler hit a landmark year in 2011. Not only did he work on four movies this whole year, he starred in two of them. Out of the four released, Just Go With It, Zookeeper, Bucky Larson, and Jack and Jill, three of them you can simply look at the film's poster and decide if you want to pay to see it. They're films that almost don't even care that they're bad.I've seen four films where Nick Swardson plays one of the lead actors or a supporting actor. Three of them easily dismissible, and one that wouldn't be considered mediocre if he was carefully extracted from the film entirely. He simply is not funny. I think it's honestly the material that makes him unfunny. I've seen scattered clips of his standup and he is slightly funny. Maybe he works better when he writes his own lines. Yet, that can't be. This was co-written by Swardson himself, who I assume wrote most, if not, all of the dialog for his character. Maybe he works best with himself and himself only locked in a sound-proof room where he can be alone with his thoughts.Adam Sandler and his Happy Madison Productions company have now just given me one of the least ambitious comedies I have ever seen. This movie doesn't even feel like it's trying to be funny. It seems to be a series of cheap shots taken at a character that was made for that one purpose. Why not make a character who has some likability? Nope. Go straight to the drawing board and come up with a desperately unfunny character with no shining qualities, give him a desperately unforgiving plot to work with where he can get himself into lame, uninspired situations, and to top him all off, make him the most gullible, pathetic title character in the last few decades of film.The fact I'm using the phrase \"least ambitious\" for a comedy film reminds me of a group of films in the last years that have also stopped trying. Parody films. They have been drab, tiresome works of dreck, glazed with immaturity and held together by such a simple, lackluster plot it almost doesn't matter. It becomes a competition for how many pop culture references can we throw into one film.The same thing sort of occurs in Bucky Larson. It's a competition to see how many unconvincing gags we can put this pathetically embarrassing protagonist in. The story centers around a misfit with an annoying overbite named Bucky Larson (Swardson). Upon discovering his parents are ex-porn star legends, he travels to Hollywood, hoping that since he is the son (hopefully) of two icons he can make a living as one as well.Let me say there is nothing funny about a man-child who pulls down his pants in front of a camera, grunting, moaning, and screaming before ejaculating. Absolutely, positively nothing funny about that scenario. Yet the film does it three, if not four times within its ninety minute runtime. If it's not funny the first time, it definitely won't be the second, the third, or even the forth time around.Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star didn't upset me as much as some would think. It actually was rather typical of Happy Madison. We've seen this goofy, oddball style before. But that is no excuse for a terrible movie. The jokes are terribly flat, the lead character we are expected to sympathize with is wretched in his presentation, the setups are typical, the writing is labored, and we are offered nothing new in the terms of layout or formula. It's a movie experience of deplorable, unforgivable quality.Starring: Nick Swardson, Christina Ricci, Don Johnson, and Stephen Dorff. Directed by: Tom Brady.",

When that scene appears in the film, someone involved in the production said \"hmm, that looks like a good place for a fart. Stick one in there if you can.\" So while the driver is smiling at Bucky's amazement over being able to stand in a car, there's an arbitrary \"FLERNT!\". You can't tell who farted or even where the fart came from. It sounds like it came from in between them in the back seat. Like Sandler was lying on the floor of the car with a whoopee cushion.That's pretty much all there is to say about Bucky Larson. It's just painfully, tragically lazy. There aren't any real \"jokes\". Jokes have a setup and a payoff. They have to conform to even the loosest of rhythms or structure. Presenting Bucky's hick appearance, Fargo accent and tiny penis as \"jokes\" doesn't qualify. There just kind of there, pointed out endlessly to no real comic effect. His prosthetic teeth also look so cheap and fake you want to rip them out of his mouth, smack him on the back of the head and bellow \"Swardson! Go to your room!\"That's really it. Don't bother picking this up even for Bad Movie Night. It's insufferably childish, lazy and boring. It marks a new low for Happy Madison, which I didn't think could be achieved. It was so depressing, I had to turn away after Bucky bursts in on Kevin Nealon when he's on the can. I had to try and find funny in the world again.",

And I wasn't disappointed. This simplistic comedy centres around the buck teeth-challenged Bucky Larson (Nick Swardson) and his dream to become a famous porn star, irregardless of his minuscule manhood. Inspired by his parents, who were once famous genre actors of the 70s, Bucky decides to challenge his destiny moving from small town Iowa to the Hollywood boulevards. Despite his physical deficiencies Bucky soon manages to enter into the business, mainly thanks to a chance meeting with rundown porn director Miles Deep (Don Johnson) and the backing of waitress Kathy McGee (Christina Ricci). Insert random below the belt jokes and off we go...The gags arrive in bundles, yet surprisingly all of them are poorly construed and remarkably flat. Honestly, not a single joke even manages to register a positive chuckle or giggle, making it a whole other level of lame comedy, surpassing the feats of the Wayan brothers, who despite all their crass lewdness register a few successful hits in each movie. Chaotic timing does not help the overall poor level of constructed gags, while actor Nicky Swardson has famously put off any future interest in him as a lead, lacking charisma and delivering a dissuasive anti-performance offering Bucky Larson no sympathetic appeal whatsoever. Somewhere in this mix decent actors show up and offer half-hearted performances, that fail to liven up proceedings. Don Johnson possibly needed the money, but the presence of Christina Ricci and Stephen Dorff in this bona fide turd is a true mystery.Lumbering along with tirades of trite jokes, this monstrosity of a movie does not even invoke laughter as to how bad it is, instead imbuing an overbearing notion of boredom.

The whole movie lacks an actual story, it's just a bunch of bad penis jokes and \"point and laugh at the freak\" jokes as well. A lot of great actors wasted (Christina Ricci, Mike O'Connell, Don Johnson) and the humor doesn't work here. It tries too hard to mix sentimental and mean-spirited stuff, which both fail. When Bucky gets a roommate, the dude (Kevin Nealon) is such a jerk that you wish he hung himself and left the poor guy alone.The entire film is predictable and Stephen Dorff looks like Bret Michaels, which isn't a good thing.

This is without a doubt the worst film of the year and one of the worst films ever made and, yet, he thinks he made a good movie. I would hate to see what comes next from him because \"Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star\" sucks on so many levels of shameful stupidity, it is sad. I managed to sit through \"Freddy Got Fingered\" back in 2001 but this garbage made me walk out the theater door and not look back.It's about a dorky kid, Bucky Larson (Nick Swardson) who discovers his weird parents were porn stars at one point and he decides to rid his sheltered life and become a porn star like them.Nick Swardson is that guy from \"I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.\" He played the gay butterfly and he showed he is funny, can play funny characters and he is talented even if that role was limited. Well, this is his big jump and Nick is the star of this picture and if this is his starting point, he has a long sad career ahead of him. Or, maybe this film will sink him because not only is this film cringe-worthy and good at dulling your intelligence, it is awkward to the point where you realize your wasted time was of greater importance and you feel stupid for watching it. The easy way to some up this film would be: \"A boring kid with buck teeth, hence \"Bucky\" becomes a pornstar when directors see him masturbate and screech like a monkey.\" How does that sound?Would it surprise you if you knew Adam Sandler was the writer to this s**t? It shouldn't. His career has been in the Jon for over ten years now and he still can't write a story that is funny or interesting, instead settling on crude humor and fart jokes. His company Happy Madison can't seem to produce a good movie either or anything funny. That's a shame when his movies still make money but I bet you this picture won't. Oh, and that guy who directed the equally cringe- worthy \"The Hot Chick\" with the bumbling Rob Schinder, who can't act his way out of a paper bag, directed this. We got an all-star team here folks. If it seems like I am being very harsh, I am. If they want to attempt to dull my intelligence with this, I am going to burn them as well for making an awful movie that no one should have to see.Nick plays the titular character who is a manchild and lives with his mom and dad in some small town and Bucky comes off as this innocent kid, to which he is, but he doesn't seem all that smart. He is an awkward kid who has been sheltered by his parents and he works at a local grocery store. You remember that character, \"Booger\" from \"Revenge of the Nerds\" back in 1984? Well, the actor, Curtis Armstrong, shows up at the beginning of the picture as Bucky's boss as a way for the producers to attempt to sell the film because of Armstrong's memorable character. Too bad, his character here is a brain-dead idiot that shows you the extent of the misery you're about to endure as the picture begins.So, this kid that doesn't seem to know anything finds his parents porn stash, yes, they were awkward porn stars back in the 1970's and all the sudden, Bucky's mission is to travel to L.A. and become a porn star. Yeah...Okay. Through a series of misunderstandings, Bucky gets a job as a porn star for a failing director, Miles Deep (that name doesn't sound sexual at all). Bucky becomes a star when the director sees his, oh god..., his small penis and somehow screeching like a monkey when he masturbates, makes women want to sleep with him. Does that sound normal to you? No! it sounds like something an idiot wrote thinking they were funny to suck the dollars out of audiences. Enter all of Adam Sandler's moron friends, because they only star in his movies, and the film has gone to total s**t. Christina Ricci shows up as bucky's new girlfriend, of course, she is, and Stephen Doriff shows up as a jerk-off porn star called, Dick Shadow, how nice. He is the typical dummy with a tough attitude who becomes threatened by the dorky kid and hides a secret but who cares? I am not going to even bother with the rest of the picture because I don't want to waste your time. As i said before, It takes a lot for me to walk out of a movie and this picture made me want to run. There is nothing salvageable from it at all and Nick needs to look elsewhere if he thinks he made a funny comedy with the crew that is responsible for \"Deuce Bigalow,\" \"The Animal\" and, the wretched \"Waterboy.\" Also, I would like to know from Nick what he thinks was funny about this picture because he attempted to defend it by calling critics, \"Morons.\" Well, I consider myself an intelligent person and an experience movie critic to which I say to Nick, \"You movie sucked! Try a better screenplay that doesn't make you look like an unintelligent idiot or maybe a career change is better for you?\"Zero/10",

Like most good ones they tend to exaggerate how good or bad a movie is. This is did not. This is awful. A few funny parts mixed in with the same joke over and over and over. The best part of this movie hands down is Kevin Nealon but he is not in it enough. I will say that I have seen worse, but this is a movie that people will watch out of curiosity and may regret it.

            "content": "The Adam Sandler-produced Nick Swardson vehicle \"Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star\" is arguably one of the most dead-on-arrival comedies of the past decade. The film is an attempt to make a fun, quirky, raunchy comedy based on the idea of a clueless, semi-ugly nice-guy who gets pulled into the world of the adult film industry, but the material is all too basic, and it doesn't take advantage at all of the situation. Jokes are all phoned-in and are the sort 13-year-old boys snicker at to each other, and the writing is downright offensively bad.Nick Swardson plays Bucky Larson, a simpleton with an outlandish set of buck-teeth. Upon discovering that his parents were famous porn-stars in the 70's, he sets off to travel to Hollywood and break into the family business, intent on becoming a star. Along the way, he meets a failing director (Don Johnson), an adorable waitress (Christina Ricci) and an antagonistic male porn star. (Stephen Dorff)The film is a definite mess. The writing is very basic. (With the most basic sexual jokes about \"size\", \"stamina\", etc imaginable) And the few attempts at raunchy, gross-out humor are poorly conveyed and equally basic and unfunny. And characters are alternating gratingly boring, or breath-takingly over-the-top. Although some of the performances give a few characters a likable edge. Particularly Ricci as Kathy, an absolutely gorgeous waitress Bucky falls for. Swardson is also not bad for the role, and despite the absolute mess, Bucky is well-played. In addition, his constantly-aggressive roommate is an absolute blast, yelling at Bucky for absolutely everything.Everything in this film is sub-par. as I said, the writing is far too basic and uninspired. The director is also bland and boring, supporting roles are underdeveloped. There are almost no laughs in the film, and the conflicts of the characters are completely and utterly unrelatable, and therefore not funny or sensical by any stretch.This is just an example of a film where everything is fundamentally underwhelming and basic to the point where it's tedious to watch. You may notice this review is pretty anemic, and that's because I simply have not been able to finish the film. I've only watched about 45 minutes of it, in pieces, fast-forwarding through the rest because it's such a flawed piece of work that I couldn't bring myself to watch the whole thing.I'm giving this an extremely generous 2 out of 10, mainly for Ricci' adorable-ness and a few funny side-characters. But seriously, take it from me- I tried to give it a chance, and I'm kicking myself for watching it. Avoid this mess.",

This movie is amazingly awful even by the standard of Adam Sandler's Happy Madison production company. That's how you know ahead of time if a movie is crap: if Adam Sandler's name is in the credits as a co-writer or an executive producer, but Sandler himself doesn't star in it. The plot: Sandler prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Nick Swardson (clearly the Rob Scheider of our time) plays Bucky Larson, a thirty-something, mentally retarded man-child living in Iowa with his conservative parents. He talks funny, has buck teeth, and has an awful haircut, and much of the movie's \"humor\" derives from that. One day after being fired from work, his friends try to cheer him up by watching \"nude movies\" only to find that Bucky's parents were once successful porn stars in the 70s. Bucky, who for some reason is not disturbed by seeing his parents in a porno, decides it is his destiny to become a porn star and heads for the San Frenando Valley.Unfortunately his genitalia is so small, he can use a straw as a condom. At the sight of a naked woman, he screeches like a hyena and ejaculates all over the place. Lucky for him a porn director Miles Deep (whose character reminds me I could be watching \"Boogie Nights\" instead of this abortion of a movie) decides that he could star in a new type of porn, where men don't feel threatened by him and women could feel that they have a prize compared to him.The movie has us root for the most unlikeable schmuck in recent memory. Consider a scene where Bucky auditions for a Mac and Cheese commercial and to the horror of the judges (and the people watching this movie) takes off his pants and starts jerking off and even sticks him thumb up his but. There are many gags like these and they all have no set up. What led Bucky to think that it was a porn audition? Does he think porn movies are the only movies out there? Take the dick drawings montage from \"Superbad\". That was funny precisely because it had a build up to it. This movie was directed by Tom Brady, not the football quarterback although he probably could have made a better movie. He has previously directed the masterpiece \"The Hot Chick\" with Rob Schneider, also a horribly unfunny movie that relied only on it's one joke premise. People when you pay to see a movie, please do some research beforehand. Know who stars in it, know who wrote it, who directed it. Read some reviews If you do so, you may always avoid seeing garbage like is. As for Nick Swardson, in the words of Roger Ebert: Your movie sucks.",

It made me think of a rerun of Zach and Miri Make A Porno on Cinemax After Dark or Hugh Hefner's runaway bride disaster. For those of you Adam Sandler fans, make sure you don't buy any movie with the words \"Happy Madison\" on it. The script, cast, even a Pauly Shore comeback can't save him from being a failure of box office bombs and the list goes on and on. Try looking at a list of great pornstars like Sasha Grey and Jenna Jamison. That'll get your head pumping. \"Bucky Larson\" is so bad, even \"Grandma's Boy\" made Grandma a nice big piece of sugar cookies.Bottom Line: This is one of the worst obese films of 2011 and as I could recall to Bucky Larson, I should re-name my title \"Bucky Larson: Born to Suck Every Adam Sandler movie and let my critics throw Subway sandwiches at me.\" Nick Swordswan, you deserved a Razzie for that and Worst Picture.",

There is no way to explain the outright awfulness of it, but I will try.It's hard to believe that such an amazing cast would even SHOW UP for this movie. Bottom line. And yeah, Nick Swardson is usually hilarious.. but come on. The character Bucky Larson is the most unlikeable character I've ever seen in a movie, and I've seen thousands by now. And that alone makes the plot unbelievable.I suppose there is a whole, \"even guys with small dick's deserve love and can get a hot girl\" message there somewhere, but its clouded by stupidity, and its never very moving, because there is just NO CHANCE Christina Ricci would ever touch \"Bucky Larson\" - Stephen Dorf has a line in the movie \"Am I in the Twilight Zone?\" That is the only place where the story of this movie would ever be even remotely believable.And to make matters worse, there is ONE conflict and it happens in the last 10 minutes of the movie. The rest is literally climbing action. There's no climax. It is seriously the worst movie I have seen in years.Don't bother. The Hangover 2 (so horrible as well) was better than this movie, and I think I laughed more here... That's saying something about the script/plot of this movie. It's just a disaster.1/10.",

She is great, but other cast members don't seem to be taking the movie as seriously as she, but that's probably because they are all mates of Sandler.Its highly predictable, things are going rest for Bucky, something knocks him back, but all comes good at the end.So its not very good, there are a few funny moments, but the film is saved by Ricci and Johnson, playing way above everyone else.",

I actually thought Swardson did OK in this movie for the role he was given but the premise of the movie was not well thought out, a dumb idiot in porn business and the idea that somehow him coming early before sex even starts would set some kind of trend in the industry and make him a star of porn. There were some very funny moments with Bucky's landlord (Kevin Nealon) and it was sort of romantic in the end how this idiot from Iowa hooks up with a babe waiter in Hollywood but the ultimate result for this movie is a failure because its just time consuming blather if you don't find Swardson's thick midwest accent amusing. Personally, this movie reminds me of Dumb and Dumberer, the wretched prequel to Dumb and Dumber, in that there were some rather funny scenes and i was able to watch the entire film but my intelligence took a hit and it was really, really dumb. 5/10 There are some occasional laughs throughout, if you make it to the end.",

That would still be a better day than the day you watched this movie. If I could give this a \"0\" instead of a \"1\", I would.

Sandler probably has not produced a moment of tolerable on-camera presence since EIGHT CRAZY NIGHTS in 2002 (oh, wait, I think that was a pre-motion capture cartoon!). All jokes aside, Sandler's LITTLE NICKY (2000) makes BUCKY LARSON look like a Best Picture Oscar contender. Further, Bucky's prosthetic beaverish front teeth are slightly less irritating than Martin Lawrence's fat suit in BIG MOMMA 1-7. When you come right down to it, BUCKY LARSON comes off sort of like a sanitized version of Voltaire's CANDIDE.

            "content": "Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star (2011): Dir: Tom Brady / Cast: Nick Swardson, Christina Ricci, Don Johnson, Stephen Dorff, Kevin Nealon: Aimed at the lowest common denominator yet it references the fact that everyone has a purpose in life. Bucky Larson is met with the reality that his parents were porn stars decades ago, and he is so excited that he sets out to Hollywood to seek stardom as well. Tom Brady whose The Comebacks is a misfire does so again with pathetic semen jokes. Nick Swardson plays the buck-toothed Bucky whose unappealing physical appearance and small manhood render him a star in the adult film industry but what is interesting here is what Larson will find truly important and how he renders stardom upon how others see you. Christina Ricci is way too talented for her cardboard role of waitress whom Bucky befriends. Her dish tray trauma is stupid, and her liking of Bucky is not convincing. Don Johnson steals scenes as a porn director who seems tailored after Burt Reynolds in the superior Boogie Nights. He was eliminated from a party but discovers Larson and renders him a star through his shortcomings. Eventually Johnson owns up to his own mistakes and misjudgements. Stephen Dorff as porn star Dick Shadow is the predictable rival whose award record will be challenged. Bucky's teeth are an obvious bad prop, and the whole ejaculation joke is pathetic especially with its poor comic aims. Vulgar yet observant take on the porn industry and our trust in physicality, results in a comedy devoid of humour and leaves more shame on anyone involved in the industry. Score: 4 / 10",

One of the writers is Adam Sandler so that should let you know what to expect. It is way below the Farelly Brothers in terms of humor and slightly worse than a Rob Schneider movie in terms of crudeness. Quite a lot of it is painful to watch but it's not a total write off. There is something uplifting in the story.Nick Swarsdon I thought was kind of annoying in 'Just Go With It' and in this movie he is annoying too but that is part of the character. He isn't a terrific comedian but he tries hard. The supporting cast is actually better than expected - quite good for what they are cast as. Christina Ricci is prettier than before and is quite sweet and touching as the girlfriend. Don Johnson is quite good as a slightly sleazy but kind porn director. Stephen Dorff is an arrogant porn star.Overall if you are in the mood for a crude comedy then it's quite cute in parts.",

My inner pre-adolescent teenager enjoyed the film for what it was.It falls into the genres of \"lowbrow\", \"dumb\", \"crude\", \"toilet humour\" and maybe \"slapstick\". You can't say it was an \"awful\" movie in the sense that it was poorly acted, written and directed. It wasn't. I think \"stupid\" is actually what Swardson, Brady, Sandler, etc. were going for. It's on the same level as making fun of handicapped kids or laughing at farts.There is an audience for movies like this, and who are we to judge this audience and the people willing to make movies to cater to them? According to IMDb, \"males under 18\" rate it just as low as everyone else. I suspect that the 11-14 year old boys who would find this movie the most amusing are not the sort to visit IMDb.",

The first is Don Johnson's concept of playing Miles Deep as a porn industry vet.This is not particularly funny, but I kept thinking it might have been more funny if his character had also been named Don Johnson, as well as a completely acceptable porn name de plume.(Look, I didn't say it was that funny, just funnier than anything in the movie.) The other thing is that Edward Herrmann, in the same week this movie is published, will also see the launch of a project more adapted to his talents, the voice of Roger Ebert's autobiography's audio version, \"Life Itself.\"In other words, Roger Ebert is only one degree of separation from the people responsible for \"Bucky Larson.\" As he is currently at the Toronto International Film Festival, I couldn't ask what he thought about this connection, but I think that if I had, his response would have been a mildly abashed nod and a request for a Purell bottle of \"Contagion\" size.Believe me, the feeling I understand.",

The shattering of stereotypes and the inclusive nature of the storyline was refreshing. The fact that men masturbate was not dodged or hinted it was an obvious fact and even in a group scene was not reflected as homo-erotic just as being a natural. I particularly liked the way the parent/son relationship was portrayed. Mom and Pop, even though they had starred in porno back in the day, came across as loving proud parents and Bucky had obviously embraced good social values.The normalization of the porn industry was well handled and yet the essential goodness of faithfulness was also brought to the fore.All in all an amusing evening and the enjoyment of seeing some sensitive issues handled with a deft touch.

If you are a fan of immature goofy movies, (Corky Romano, Dodgeball, Freddy Got Fingered, The Rocker etc.) or the Jerky Boys tapes, you will get a lot of laughs. Let's talk about some of the actors. Nick Swardson's character, Bucky Larson, really relies on others for laughs and it's a unique character so it is hard to critique. The supporting cast does well to compliment him. He puts on a great Minnesotan accent a la 'Fargo' only exaggerated to the 10th power. Christina Ricci as always puts on a great performance as the romantic lead - very sincere and believable. Stephen Dorff, who I actually can't stand, was absolutely perfect for the villain role. He did a fantastic job and came off almost likable as a complete douche. There were some good characters who did well and added a lot to the movie, but it was Don Johnson who stole the show. I cracked up at nearly every line he had. His delivery was flawless. I am really surprised at how funny he was. You can compare his role to that of the legendary Rip Torn in Dodgeball and Freddy Got Fingered. I really can't stress how great Don Johnson was. The movie is light, there is no real drama in it that you have to deal with, it's just about getting some good laughs and forgetting about everything else for an hour and a half. Don't go in expecting Meet the Parents or some cerebral comedy. It's a goof flick, I would definitely recommend it for anyone who is immature like me. The movie bombed in theaters and I am not surprised. It should do well on PPV and DVD with people like me who don't go to theaters anymore. Just rented it from Redbox and it was a dollar well spent.",

It was a \"bad movie\" done entirely on purpose by the director and writers.

Pain. However I'll give it an extra star because there are a few gags that actually land and you'll probably have one or two hearty chuckles. And Christina Ricci delivers a solid performance. Actually the supporting cast in general is pretty solid. It just makes it all the more confusing, like how are these people supporting Nick Swardson.

This movie has impacted society so much following the come of the infamous young notorious 'Bucky Larson'!. Bucky appears to be your every day sweet heart but deep down he's a chigga chigga bad boy, unlike P'diddy Bucky Larson is not gang related, he is affiliated with the top people in the industry of L.A and uses his ol' folks skills to succeed in life. This movie will inspire young people all around the world to follow their dreams and not give up when the chicks are down. This movie smashed in records at the box office snatching a whooping '$2.5 million' the budget happened to be '$10 million' but its times like this when the chicks are down that like 'Bucky Larson' that you buckle up and follow your dreams. Watch other movies like 'Shawshank Redemption' 'Batman: Darknight' or the basic and generic 'Babby Driver' none of these movies compare to the sophisticated 'Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star'. The amount of diversity and satisfaction you obtain is quite unique and fresh to the audience. In conclusion this film is far better and timid compared to the 'Doogie Howser TV SHOW'. The kids will love it as well whats better then that? That's a rhetorical question by the way of course there going to love it. Bucky Larson the character is the definition of raw perfection and 'Nick Swardson' the actor is very talented.

Not just that, they always have a pure heart.  I believe future generations will look at Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler films like my generation view Jimmy Stewart and Jerry Lewis movies... as classics.  Although I, myself, have barely seen any of those classics like \"The Nutty Proffesor\" or \"The Philadelphia Story\", but am aware of their reputation.\n\nBucky Larson turned off many because of its hypersexualized humor even though Bucky himself is a virgin which is the only way the movie could work.  It's nowhere near as smart nor realistic as \"The 40 Year Old Virgin\" nor does it have any traditional observational humor except when it lampoons the porn industry.  Stephen Dorff is excellent as Nick Swardson's rival and the lovely Christina Ricci is wonderful as always.\n\nThe Chemistry between Christina and Nick in their respective roles is palpable enough for the viewer to get lost in the virtually implausible storyline and crass humor.  There is an excellent supporting cast with Nick Turturro, Don Johnson and Kevin Nealon in hilarious roles.  The movie is very very funny, but not for everyone's taste.  Many will be disgusted at the premise and more will be turned off by the unlikelyhood a guy like Bucky in real life could ever get a girl like the starry eyed Kathy.  But the movie has plenty of heart and that's where it works the most.\n\n88/100 B+  It is a modern day classic with a unique approach to the Romance Comedy which will be more appreciated in the years to come.",

Christina Riici is outstanding here.

Bucky Larson was savaged by critics when it came out and it's easy to see why. In an hour and a half Nick Swardson & co. manage to squeeze in just about every HM trope. Underestimated, geeky lead, inexplicably interested love interest, one dimensional, unfunny bullies, characters with either bizarre motivation or not motivation at all, contrived scenarios, a fetish for crude humour and cringeworthy attempt at sentimentality. I'll admit I did laugh a couple of times, but for nearly the entire 90-minute runtime I wore an expression of befuddlement. How did anyone think this was entertaining, or clever, or in any way worthy of being shown to the public? Swardson is a painfully unfunny presence, chewing every inch of scenery with his stupid prosthetic teeth, overacting even the tamest of jokes and utterly failing at attempts in engaging our interests or sympathies. It's sad to see the likes of Don Johnson and Christina Ricci debasing themselves with the lousiest of scripts, looking truly stunned at the stupidity of the lines they're being paid to deliver. It's no wonder it bombed and has been largely forgotten. Some things are best left to the pages of history. This one doesn't even deserve a footnote.",

He hires Bucky since he is the son of stars and they stumble into a weird niche of films where Bucky makes a mess everywhere.

Relax people and let your inner juvenile have some fun, it won't kill you and you will be more well rounded and interesting for it.",

This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life and Adam Sandler has got to be really ashamed being involved in this pile of crap. This film succeeds at nothing whatsoever and only leaves you wandering why it was ever even made.

It's actually kind of insulting that it expects you to laugh without even beginning to give you any reason why you should. I'm positive that you actually have to lower both your intelligence and standards (even if don't particularly hold high ones) to a point far past lower than what is thought to be as low as they can possibly sink for this abomination to even somewhat appeal to you in the slightest manner of which it could only evoke a half-coughed wheeze of a singular laugh out of the bottom of your stomach. You can't relate with any of the characters, as none of them are likable in any way; especially the main protagonist (though I'm hesitant to classify him as that) who barely seems human at times. There's so little substance in everything about this, that I wouldn't give this the honor of being called even the lowest form of \"entertainment\", it's literally the pinnacle of stupidity. Digging beyond the lowest point of film-making, and for it to have the NERVE to actually try to incorporate an underlying romantic subplot in an attempt to take it seriously, is degrading to every life and unborn life to ever grace the earth, unquestionably cementing this as one of the worst films of all time.",

The main character of Bucky tires very quickly and wears on you for most of the movie. Even though things go his way overall, he takes the brunt of too much ridicule making the movie come off as mean spirited. I hate to see this blemish Nick Swardson's career so badly. It is his first shot at a lead role and while I do not think he is first billed material, I do think is capable of better than this.

Just small parts.\n\nBucky Larson is an ordinary loser who lives in the Midwest, and after he sees a nude flick, that his parents starred in, he wants to follow in their footsteps and heads out for the bright lights of Hollywood. \n The film fails in all aspects and is painfully unfunny. I never thought I'd ever see a movie even more stupid than Jack and Jill. The plot sucks, there's little attempt at character development that isn't very interesting at all, and the acting isn't good. It feels like a spoof film, and it's hard to get good acting with this poorly written script. \n The film relies on three main unfunny jokes: Bucky's buck teeth, his small penis, and his premature ejaculation. \n The only good thing about this film is the short appearance by Adam Herschman (Glen from Accepted), he wasn't exactly funny but it was nice to see him in a film again. Like I said, it's hard to be funny in this flick. The talents of Nick Swardson and Christina Ricci are extremely \nwasted. \n I don't know how this is a movie.

The gross out jokes are sickening, the main character is unbelievably stupid and the plot so predictable it's frustrating. How can we believe, in a comedy set on earth that someone would be so stupid to think that masturbating to a porno film featuring your own parents is normal and that just because your parents were in a dirty movie that you are yourself \"born to be a star\"? Nick Swardson plays \"Bucky\", a mentally challenged, bucked-tooth and incredibly naive boy who misunderstands his parent's history as 70's porn stars as a sign that he should travel to Hollywood himself because he is destined to be a star as well. Actually that description is inaccurate because there is nothing in the film to indicate that \"Bucky\" was brain damaged in an accident or was born with a medical condition but he acts like such a cretin that you almost have to see the film as an incredibly bizarre and cruel film about a naive boy who is tricked by the entire porn industry into thinking he is a hero when in fact they are all laughing at him behind his back and not as the actual movie they are presenting to us. When \"Bucky\" arrives in Hollywood he acts like an alien that has no understanding of human customs (stripping for a grape juice ad, acting like a wild animal in the presence of women and sleeping outside like a beast because he can't find a place to live) until he inexplicably catches the eye of the prettiest girl in the movie, becomes a huge sensation and somehow becomes the biggest porn star in the history of the medium. Nick Swardson could not have picked a worse film to try and jump-start his film career and audiences will feel embarrassed for Christina Ricci, who is a legitimately good actress who is stuck playing a woman who's life ambition is to be a waitress. Yes you read that right. \"Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star\" is an the definition of a cinematic train wreck and even if you like to make fun of bad movies you should under no circumstances see this film.",

The characters and plot are implausibly positioned and there is a huge lack of cohesive sense to the story - one can only suspend disbelief so much before accepting shear stupidity.  Christina Ricci hands in a painful performance and Don Johnson surely isn't stealing the show like Burt Reynolds did in Boogie Nights.  Stephen Dorff is believable as the successful rival porn star.

            "content": "Nick Swardson co-writes and stars in this Happy Madison gross-out comedy about the biggest dork ever entering the adult film industry. ...Man, do I even need to make a \"How can this go wrong?\" joke? I can think imagine that plenty of people out there are thinking, \"No need, because seeing as it's a Happy Madison production, we already know that you like it.\" Hey, I'm just going ahead and speaking for the readers, because although I neither liked nor disliked the other Happy Madison films of 2011, considering that this is the internet, all anyone is going to remember is the \"didn't dislike\" part, and I can understand, because I'm giving these films more credit than they deserve by calling them \"borderline\" bull. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, in all fairness, compared to this film, I almost love those other Happy Madison productions. ...Yeah, I'm waiting for the part where I say, \"Okay, maybe that's going a bit too far\", but that's not going to happen, because this film is absolutely unpalatable. Okay, maybe it's not as bad as I though, in as much as I was going in expecting an unparalleled, unholy experience of horrible pain while watching this abomination of desolation torture me in fashions that make the stuff they do in Guantanamo Bay look like getting slapped in the arm with a thin rubber band, when really, all I got was just a mental scar, because, make no mistake, this film is still pretty blasted awful, and yet the torture still goes toned down just a slight smidge by... hot chicks... and that's just about it.\r\n\r\nIf I have nothing else to say about this film, then it's the fact that... um... I'm at least glad that the ridiculously over-the-top offensive hick town that the Bucky Larson character comes from is in the Midwest and not the South, because if it took place in Alabama, then I'd be just about ready to kill somebody. No, but seriously though, although I would have probably actually spent money to have Nick Swardson hurt horribly if he was taking shots at sweet home Alabama, I feel genuinely offended on behalf of those poor buck-toothed, Dutch-accented weat farmers in Iowa - you bet ya -, mostly because it's a joke that's so startlingly unfunny (Yes, even less funny than the Iowa joke I just made), as opposed to about, I think three jokes that are actually pretty good, as much as I hate to admit it. Okay, now, there are points where timing and absurdity fluke and create a quick gut punch that evokes a chuckles, and that would be the John Mayer joke that Kevin Nealon practically introduces himself with, and that's about it. Okay, fine, after that, the film makes a few undeniable flukes, and yet, what really keeps this film from falling so far under the radar that it's untracable has to be those moments where the film stops being so over-the-top and fall back into being that kind of Happy Madison down-to-earth, where things are still exaggerated, but mediocrely so. Of course, even that tonal shift is a glaring flaw in the film, because this film's dance between over-the-top and relatively down-to-earth is so inorganic and incompetent, making the film tonally inconsistent. Still, those inconsistent moments are far and few between, because this film mostly rests on one type of tone, and as much as I wish I could say the frequent tone is the mediocre, relatively down-to-earth, I've got too many scars from the awful over-the-top to know that's not the case. I really don't know what to say; this film is just an absolute embarassment, and yet, I just have to bite the bullet and go into detail, because if you're thinking that there's even a mild glimmer of hope, I have to educate you before you see this film and hurt yourself beyond any repair, emotionally, mentally and, well, physically, because watching this film made my muscles almost instinctively jump out of me to try and get away.\r\n\r\nEven during it's mediocre, relatively down-to-earth moments, the film is cheesy and somewhat obnoxious, and yet, it's hard to not beg for more of that when the film jumps back to the over-the-top that is more prominent throughout the film, because the torturous \"humor\" that this foundation is practically built upon is anything but palatable. Fish-out-of-water humor, alone, is enough to drive me up a wall, as it stands among my absolute biggest pet peeves in comedy; right up there with over-the-top, gross-out raunchy. Put those two pieces of \"humor\" together, and you've an unrelenting barrage of horrorible, consistently fall-flat humor that's obnoxious enough at a slow and steady deliver, let alone when it's delivered with the kind of frenetic loudness that can be found in this film. Now, the film isn't as relentlessly, frantically vulgar and loud as something like \"Freddy Got Fingered\", or else I probably would have bailed by the hour mark, but believe me, this film is still loud and annoying in its totally unreasonable and unfunny gross-out scenarios. However, through all of that lack of intelligence and wit, this film still boasts volumes of pretense in its atmosphere, as if the swill it's spouting is comedy gold. It's a problem with most films of this type, and this film isn't as intense in its pretense as something like a Friedberg/Seltzer movie, or the aforecited \"Freddy Got Fingered\", the film still stands with its chest in the wind as it pokes at you over and over again, silently exclamining, \"Isn't this funny, you stupid, money-making movie-gore?\" It's a problem I often have with Nick Swardso, who, I must admit, isn't as terrible and unlikable as I expected, but is still so very obnoxious, showing that even when he's at his best, he's still an annoying, pretentious little idiot in this powerful testament to his lack of talent, as well as how \"not\" to make a performer vehicle, much less a movie.\r\n\r\nTo shut down this star, credit to the ever so occasional fluke in humor, as well as those moments where the film tonally inconsistently, but still relievingly tones down the over-the-top and stands as simply mediocre; yet on the whole, this film wishes it could be as good as mediocre, and I don't just mean that figuratively, as this film, with an overbearing pretense, delivers one wildly offensive, repulsively disgusting and obnoxiously frantic fall-flat joke of a joke after another as it self-righteously pushes and pushes for any kind of positive reaction, when really, the only reactions it gets and deserves to get are overwhelmingly negative, thus making \"Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star\" to collapse as an insufferable, mean-spirited onslaught of unbearable raunch that, like all the other atrocities of its type, haunts, scars and gives both comedy and filmmaking, in general.\r\n\r\n1/5 - Awful",

I'll also be honest and throw out there that I have never once really found Nick Swardson to be at all funny, so that really doesn't help the situation here.  However, Bucky Larson doesn't destroy my faith in cinema, as every critic panned.  I'll also openly admit that I laughed quite a bit during this, but maybe it was because I just needed an absolutely stupid movie to laugh at. I don't know.   Bucky Larson is loud, crude, rude, and plain offensive at times.   However, I found quite a few things to laugh at, not that I would recommend this movie to anyone.  In a world where we have many hilarious and classic R-rated comedies, Bucky Larson stands as less then a foot-note, that's for sure.  The movie itself gets 2 stars, but I had to award an extra half star to Kevin Nealon for his insanely hilarious and random cameo appearances in this, all of which not only make no sense, but he pops up at the right moments.",

Obviously, that positive part get's dark when you realize that the job he does is not good and is not a thing actors or actresses should do to get famous. Seriously, is true.\n\nPlot: Is simple, Bucky discovers something about his parents. They were famous persons in the past, something he wants to be. He wants to get on Hollywood, get awards, etc. But he will do it in the wrong profession...the one his parents did. The other story inside this one? Kathy's story, which I think is the most nice one and should be the one people should admire, since is not vulgar, nasty and horrible as Larson's. Spoil much? Nope. You want to know what this stories are about in full speed? Watch the movie, but trully, I won't recommend it at any cost.\n\nActing: Nick as Bucky....I never imagined him on a role like this one. First of all, those teeths looked SUPER FAKE! (dunnot if I write right or wrong the teeth thing). But honestly, I got surprised. Christina as Kathy did great, really, her role was trully for her. The rest of the cast did somehow great and somehow meh (needed more skills I admit). Anyway, one star for them all.\n\nMusic: Some songs were nice for some parts, some were not used properly. Defenetly, the score was ok, the songs were amazing, but they were not great for the scenes. So, one star for the effort made in this part, crew, cast and director.\n\nTo end this review, 2 stars of 5. Enjoy and HASTA LA PROXIMA AMIGOS/AS! CHAO! BLESS YOU ALL!!!",

With that said  the script is awful;  the villain, or antagonist, or whatever you wish to call him in this film, doesn't seem to really provide any real resistance to the protagonist, and there doesn't seem to be any real inciting conflict in the film until the last 15 minutes of the film.  I almost feel if this had been done as if it were a \"Behind the Music\" expose' it might have actually worked a little better.  As a straight movie it did little for me.

I won't hate on Bucky as much as every critic out there, but it certainly was sub-par coming from the Sandler crowd. \n\nSwardson, for a while, was the funniest actor in movies. Grandma's Boy is top three of all-time funny. He was also funny in Chuck and Larry and Benchwarmers among others. This is quite a step backwards. The character is not that funny, nor were most of the situations. I chuckled some, but it's not real funny like his other stuff. That said, I've often disliked Sandler movies on the first time through, only to really enjoy them later. Maybe, just maybe that's the case here though I'm skeptical. \n\nNot much else to say on this one. Ricci is actually kinda adorable instead of weird for once.

Movies like The Happening and Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li are awful because I play up how insane they are, giving you a challenge just to know how bad it is. This is not the case with the excruciatingly unpleasant Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star. Do not see this movie. Do not EVER see this movie. Yes, I'm guilty of seeing it because of the astoundingly bad reviews due to my curiosity of how putrid it could be, but I saw it anyway and regret it and I don't want you to suffer the same fate. It's worse than people make it out to be... it's nowhere near being a fun kind of bad. In the realm of terrible cinema, is there anything worse than a boring, laugh-free comedy? It's offensive not in the porn-centered story, but in the way the comedy and characters are so putrid. Bucky (Nick Swardson) is a bad Midwestern stereotype like Marge Gunderson from Fargo but with no appeal. Big teeth hasn't been funny since the 1800's, but a great number of jokes are devoted to it. Christina Ricci has to act like Bucky is charming; something Meryl Streep can't even pull off. Plus, dick jokes... I guess if you're eight years old and not desensitized, you may laugh, but that's because you haven't matured yet.\n\nNothing here is funny. You can create a comic world where everything is satirical or over-the-top silly, but this requires talent and a funny screenplay and there is none of that here. From the first two minutes, I knew this was going to be contender for the worst comedy ever made. I'm convinced Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star was made to make Adam Sandler's other bad comedies look pleasing and dignified. Once again, do NOT watch... ever.",

Pretty much everyone hates Nick Swardson because he is one annoying fuckstain little brat and I don't think he has starred or wrote a single good movie. The only good movie I can think of that he starred in was Bolt, the animation film by Walt Disney starring John Travolta as the title character. Anyway the story is about Nick Swardson who plays \"BUCKY LARSON\", the normal average daily life guy who has big goofy teeth and watches porn with his friends. Yeah classic. Anyway when he finds out that his parents were once porn stars, he finds out that he is \"BORN TO BE A STAR\"! so he does all this dumb shit like stripping in front of the camera, getting horny before having sex with the girl and cumming all over the place. Yeah movie you are so messed up. I don't mind someone being goofy or sexual references in a film which i always love but turning that into a annoyfest just to b funny is what I hated the most In this huge failure. Unfortunately another failure I had recognized in this film was Adam Sandler as the writer an producer along with Nick Swardson and another guy which was not his best career move. Stephen Dorff has added another shitty movie to his shitty career's list along with Alone in the Dark and Christina Ricci who I loved since Sleepy Hollow had almost killed her career with this film. Why Christina? WHY!?!?!? This was a film that was so broken and lame that it should be buried forever! Not a single fuck, NOT A SINGLE FUCK! likin this film shows how much peope hate this film so much! Bucky Larson: Born To Be a Star gets a 3/10.",

I cannot criticize it for being about porn because Boogie Nights was exclusively about the world of porn and I think it was one of the BEST film of the 1990's.  Boogie Nights treated its characters as flawed human beings searching for acceptance and a feeling of belonging -- Bucky Larson's characters are all supposed to be laughed at and there are just too many times throughout the movie which had me wanting to rush to the bathroom (notice no running for me) to vomit as 89% of the film is stomach-churning.  This should pretty-much END the career of anybody involved and I am actually surprised that Adam Sandler's name is attached as both a writer and a producer of this trash (Sandler also gave us Jack and Jill and Just Go With It this year [the latter film is only saved b/c of the over-the-top performance of the unlikely physical commedienne Nicole Kidman] ... so I question whether or not his days are  numbered?).  An unfunny-to-me Nick Swardson (Just Go With It, 30 Minutes or Less, Blades of Glory) -- who's career is mostly stand-up comedy -- stars as the grotesquely buck-toothed Bucky Larson who believes he is destined for a glorious career in porn after discovering his parents were au natural (un-shaven, un-waxed, un-spray-tanned, un-fit etc) pornstars of the 1970's.  Leaving behind an insulting-to-midwesterners existence in Iowa (only found in the movies -- he didn't attend high school because his town didn't have one), the RIDICULOUSLY-accented Bucky (that is NOT an Iowa accent ... but let's throw-out another stupid laugh at the expense of the heartland) heads to LA where his dreams can come true.  Bucky luckily meets the nice, big-hearted waitress (Christina Ricci - Sleepy Hollow, Penelope, Monster -- and no wonder she seeked-out employment on television!) at a random diner who befriends him, finds him a place to live (with crazy-jerk roommate Kevin Nealon - \"SNL\", \"Weeds\", Just Go With It) and sets him in the right direction of finding work.  Don Johnson (Tin Cup, Machete ... who's short-lived career rebirth must be over) is porn director Miles Deep (ugh) who sees something \"special\" in Bucky (disgusting) and decides to exploit the freak (its explained in the film ... but I don't recommend watching this to figure out the freak-tag that has NOTHING to do with his teeth!).  Stephen Dorff (who's stellar \"comeback\" with the excellent film Somewhere must have been a fluke!!) plays the jealous porn-star rival.  As vulgar and repulsive as this film is, there is suprisingly little flesh on display.  It would be difficult to pick-out the worst part of this film as that would pretty-much be the whole thing.  Just as impossible would be finding \"the best\" part.  This film isn't bad because it is offensive -- we've had Bridesmaids and two Hangover fillms.  What works with those 3 films is that they are \"equal-opportunity offenders\" ... this one -- NOT so much.  It is rank and rancid and beyond mere words for criticism.  I NEVER want to see something like this again.",

It stars Nick Swardson, also known as the unfunniest comedian in Hollywood, and my public enemy #1.  He is as frustrating as ever here; every time he opens his mouth to speak with that nails on a chalkboard accent and with those stupid goddamn teeth, I just wanted to strangle the life out of him with an extension cord.  There are also other celebrities in here, who remind you what a sad state of affairs this movie is; Christina Ricci is in this, which is a spectacularly depressing feat to watch.  This is beneath Don Johnson, and it is even beneath Pauly Shore, which you know is saying something.  The writing is unspeakably obscene, and there isn't a single thing in here that's inoffensive or even funny, for that matter, as everything is a disgusting, unamusing gross out gag.  This is a laugh-free movie that is littered with face palms, and hopefully, if anything good comes out of this, it's the financial failure that speeds up Nick Swardson's inevitable fade into obscurity.

In fact, the only thing that is consistently worse than his films are the ones he produces for his friends. Such is the case of \"Bucky Larson\", a dismal, dreadful and excruciatingly distasteful comedy starring his buddy and frequent collaborator Nick Swardson. Even more upsetting, perhaps, is that the movie is just so lazy.\r\nIt follows the cookie cutter pattern of all the Happy Madison productions. Create a supposedly lovable, goofy character who is a really one-note, annoying moron. Fill the film with supporting characters who pop up from time to time to do or say something nonsensical. And finally, give the lead dweeb and impossibly hot girlfriend and try to make the film sweet by letting her see something in him that no one else can, including the audience. \r\nIn this case, that unfortunate part goes to a radiant Christina Ricci who hasn't looked this good on film in a long, long time. Swardson proves once and for all that he cannot carry a movie and should always be a secondary performer at best. It's an offensive, embarrassing performance that's one joke. And that one joke was never funny to begin with.\r\nI laughed a total of three times, and I'm not very proud to have to admit that. The majority of the jokes are quite obvious and have to do with Swardson's exaggerated appearance. It ups the ante of distasteful humor to the breaking point, and I just felt like walking out after thirty minutes.\r\n\"Bucky Larson\" seems to aspire to new lows, and that's a target it hits with ease. It does my heart good to see people are rejecting it en masse.",

Nick Swardson is genuinely funny and the unevenness of the story may not sit well with all viewers, but enough sporadic laughs keep it from sinking too low.\n\nBeginning in a rural town in Iowa, Bucky Larson starts as a an underprivileged bum pushing middle age who still lives with his folks and works as a checkout boy at the local grocery store. He thinks he is breaking all boundaries by getting together with some buddies to watch some old porn movies. But this turns out to be more than he bargained for as he realizes this porno stars his parents! Though most would be scarred for life upon seeing their parents bang on screen, Bucky sees it as his destiny\u00e2\u00a6being a porn star is in his genes!!!! Next thing we know, Bucky is off to Hollywood to fulfill his destiny and happens to meet a kind diner waitress who quickly becomes his soul mate. He goes surprisingly far and manages to meet just the right people who can make his dreams sore\u00e2\u00a6except for one bitterly jealous dude who just might jeopardize everything he has set out for.\n\nThis one lagged at the box office and is hardly a memorable film, but its share of yucks makes it a good selection to enjoy while drunk (if you get off on this sort of thing). Swardson is good in his first leading role and Christina Ricci is quite watchable as his charming love interest. Edward Herrmann, Kevin Nealon and Miriam Flynn (known for her role as Cousin Catherine in the \u00e2Vacation\u00e2? films) are also fun in supporting roles. Probably not the best couple hours to invest into one\u00e2(TM)s day, but you could certainly do worse.",

Overall, if you have that thought in the back of your mind that says this movie might suck, that's the right way to think about this.

After seeing \"Bucky Larson: Born To Be A Star,\" which breaks said rule in the first scene and continues to do so throughout its course, I think a few new rules ought to be employed. Rules that prohibit characters to have one-trick jokes involving buck teeth, doofy hairdos, ridiculous accents, bestiality and certain physical inadequacies. I may feel sick to my stomach if I am ever reminded of this miserable tragedy.\r\n\r\nI won't make the obvious joke about how Bucky Larson himself, Nick Swardson, is NOT born to be a star; other critics have already run that joke into the ground. Sure, the only movie I found him to be legitimately funny in was \"30 Minutes Or Less\" (where he was still upstaged by Danny McBride), but Swardon DESERVES better than this. In fact, every person in the cast warrants a better use of their talent. Christina Ricci, Kevin Nealon, Don Johnson, Pauly Shore. Yes, Pauly [freaking] Shore, the guy who was in such abysmal trainwrecks as \"Jury Duty,\" \"Bio-Dome\" and \"In The Army Now,\" is too good for this bomb.\r\n\r\nThis cinematic conflagration tells the story of a na\u00efve young Iowa...boy (man?) named Bucky Larson. This is a character that the film somehow wants us to empathize with and concurrently point our fingers and laugh at, I guess. Only problem is that I don't remember ever identifying with him as a person and I CERTAINLY didn't do any laughing in this movie. The aptly named Bucky (because his two front teeth match the size of a beaver's) lives a humble existence with his parents (Edward Hermann and Miriam Flynn), but a kind elderly woman named Mrs. Bozobop (ho ho!) tells him one day that he was put on this earth to do something with his life. Destiny awaits him somewhere down the line.\r\n\r\nLater that same night, an epiphany comes to Bucky as he and his equally gawky friends convene to watch some adult videos. As you may have already predicted, Bucky is a pure minded fellow who knows not the slightest thing about sexual acts or human anatomy or innuendo, so the guys give him a crash course on the subject in repulsively graphic detail, yet told as if it is coming from the mouths of some immature fifth graders who have little to no idea what they are talking about. As they watch one video, they realize the two people in it look oddly familiar...like Bucky's folks...oh God, no.\r\n\r\nYup, it is them alright. So is Bucky understandably shocked and appalled and possibly scarred for life from seeing his parents nude and on film? Actually no. Instead, he is jumping with joy at the thought that he is the offspring of a couple of so-called 'celebrities.' He runs back home to ask them about it, and sure enough, they admit to it to their son with the utmost honor. Putting two and two together, he believes that his destiny must be to travel all the way to Hollywood and become a \"movie star,\" just like his mom and dad were. Speaking of mom and dad, they support his decision to journey onward and they even help him pack up. Don't you just love it when characters' personalities do a 180 out of nowhere with no explanation?\r\n\r\nOn his unbelievable voyage, he becomes good friends with a sweet diner waitress named Kathy (Ricci) who dreams of landing a bigger and better job in the food world. Christina Ricci's big doe-eyes and caring smile may be the only glimmering hope in an utterly desolate project and the half-star rating I will arrive on may as well belong entirely to her. As for the other eccentric side characters, we have an easily irritable roommate for Bucky (Nealon), the sleazy, washed-out skin flick director Miles Deep (ho ho!) played by Don Johnson, and a hot shot porn actor named Dick Shadow (ho ho!) played by Stephen Dorff. Who gave these people their names? Austin Powers?\r\n\r\nAnd through a series of events that are equal parts stupid and unlikely, Bucky becomes an overnight sensation on the Internet thanks to a website I will not directly name, but it's a revolting play on the brand 'YouTube.' Oh, and if I haven't warned you yet, I hope you like jokes about big teeth and small male appendages, because the film has no shortage (ahem!) of these. And if that is not all, it may have even more moments where Bucky vapidly responds to questions with the innocence of a child: \"I thought you had some sort of macaroni and cheese fetish.\" \"Oh, I don't use feta. Only cheddar.\" Well played, Bucky...well played, indeed.\r\n\r\nI simply could not crack a smile while watching \"Bucky Larson: Born To Be A Star.\" I was too offended by the sheer laziness in writing gags and by the blatant disregard for the audience's intellect that I wanted to crawl into a whole and wait until it was over with. This is a joyless comedic wasteland that fails to deliver raunchy laughs and doesn't even offer much cheap nudity if you are a perv who is looking for that kind of thing. Plus, I could have come up with a better title: \"Bucky Larson: PORN to Be A Star.\" I had one more good idea OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD than this film had in its gag-inducingly long 97-minute length. \r\n\r\nBucky Larson is a born devastation.\r\n\r\n0.5/4",

            "content": "September 9, 2011\r\n\r\nLet me be clear: \"Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star\" is a very bad movie--stupid, unfunny and infantile. It's clearly one of the worst movies of the year. And yet, it's not mean or hateful, and in that regard, it's not a completely painful experience. It's a bad one for sure, but it's more lethargic than excruciating. That's about the only praise I can offer it.\r\n\r\nAfter the movie, I pictured the so-called creative sessions between the three screenwriters, Adam Sandler, Allen Covert and Nick Swardson. I wondered, when they gathered to write this swill, did they really laugh at the material they were putting on paper? When one of them pitched the idea of a grown man masturbating in front of his friends, did the others start to laugh and urge him to keep going with it? Is that how they responded to the overall tired premise of a Midwestern man coming to Hollywood to be a porn star? Or that same man having a small penis and ejaculating uncontrollably?\r\n\r\nI suppose this kind of stuff can be funny in certain contexts, like when talking crudely among your guy friends at a party or on a long road trip, but that doesn't mean it belongs in a screenplay. Unfortunately, Sandler, Covert and Swardson see things differently, and because of Sandler's inexplicably strong box-office clout, what he says probably goes, which includes letting his friends write and star in their own movies. If only Sandler would star in a bomb; maybe then movie studios would question his decisions.\r\n\r\nSwardson plays the title character, Bucky Larson, a buck-tooth, virginal mamma's boy from a Podunk town in Iowa. One day he's fired from his job as a bagger at the local grocery store and his friends decide to cheer him up by showing him a porno. To their surprise, the thirtysomething Bucky has never masturbated before, so they give him tips and watch him conduct himself as the movie rolls. When he sees his parents (Edward Hermann and Miriam Flynn) are the stars of the porn, he thinks it's his destiny to follow in their footsteps. So he hops on the bus for Los Angeles and tries to break into the industry.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, he befriends a cute waitress named Kathy (Christina Ricci) and meets a has-been porn director named Miles Deep (Don Johnson), who offers him a leading role because he figures there's a variety of perverse, sexual audiences out there, even ones willing to pay to see Bucky. The first day of shooting reveals Bucky is prone to involuntary orgasms at the slightest hint of female sexuality, and the footage becomes an overnight sensation on YouTube. By sheer luck and circumstance, Bucky is suddenly rocketed him into porn superstardom.\r\n\r\nYou might say \"Bucky Larson\" is a play on \"Forrest Gump\" and \"Boogie Nights,\" as it's about an ignorant wanderer who obtains fame just by being in the right place at the right time, and because that fame happens to be rooted in the porn industry. And just like Dirk Diggler, Bucky wins several awards and steals the limelight away from the current porn juggernaut, Dick Shadow (Stephen Dorff).\r\n\r\nBut even though I dared to compare \"Bucky Larson\" to \"Forest Gump\" and \"Boogie Nights,\" purely from a content point of view, I'm not saying Sandler, Covert or Swardson were necessarily mindful enough to satirize those two movies, not least because their idea of humor hovers around that of a 10-year-old, one who's curious about sex and private parts but too embarrassed to ask questions and then simply reverts to making fun of them as a defense mechanism.\r\n\r\nHowever, because this movie is rated R, and rightfully so, it's not likely to reach many 10-year-olds, which then begs the question, who's it actually meant for? I know humor is all relative, but I can't imagine any adult would find this material funny. Maybe it's for those who find overgrown buck teeth a riot? Or maybe fans of Kevin Nealon, who plays Bucky's irascible L.A. roommate? Either way, the list is small.\r\n\r\nWhat's baffling is how an actress as pleasant and full of range as Christina Ricci would ever think to appear in this movie. Although, in a way, I'm grateful she did, because her radiant face and charisma helped save it from being a total disaster. She is at least sweet and likable, as is Swardson, but the material and jokes are so puerile that it's darn near impossible not to always be shaking your head or rolling your eyes.\r\n\r\nStill, as much as I cringed during this movie, I have to admit I didn't walk away angry. That's not laudation, but more an observation that \"Bucky Larson\" isn't so bad it deserves to be placed in the lower echelon of offensive movies, just bad ones. The movie is stupid, but it's the kind of stupid you automatically forget as opposed to actively trying to forget. And I have a feeling that when Sandler, Covert and Swardson realize just how badly it's going to crash and burn, not only with critics but also at the box-office, they'll be the ones trying to actively forget it. I suppose that's an appropriate punishment for writing it.",

Not that that will make it easier to sit through -- you've got to do a lot of thinking to get through the initial pain of watching.\r\n\r\nIt's well known that Adam Sandler has outgrown his infantile, baby-voiced six-year-olds-in-a-man's-body parts to become a mainstream actor in romantic comedies and occasional serious star vehicles. It is also now apparent that he is still being pitched the same tired old horseshit that he saw from his early successes and odd Saturday Night Live characters.\r\n\r\nAnd he's sick of them.\r\n\r\nSo he and his production team sat down to explore every mindless cliche that attaches to just such a movie.

Throw in a few jabs at \"Boogie Nights,\" and a brilliant use of Don \"Beer Can\" Johnson as the pron director, and you have a brilliant movie that's bound to enchant every Frenchman who's ever worn a beret.\r\n\r\nFrom its initial (but soon-dropped) awful visual production valuea at the start, to the over the top. . . . well, everything, this is a bold , daring, and ultimately brilliant movie.\r\n\r\nThat will be hated by every critic to see it.\r\n\r\nWhy should they waste time enjoying the thought behind it when they can pan it on its superficial flaws.\r\n\r\nWhich permeate every frame.

It might be the worst comedy ever made or maybe the funniest...I am not sure.\n\nSo the plot is about as linear as you can get.  Weird kid from Iowa goes to his friends house and they put on an old porn movie which stars his parents from the 70s.  So his parents were famous porn stars in the 70s but they are as weird as him.  However, after being fired from his job at the grocery store he believes is destiny is to go to hollywood to be in porn.\n\nThat's basically the movie.  Kind of like the naive, midwest kid who isn't retarded but just well sheltered.  He goes off to the big city with nothing and runs into people who unlike normal hollywood don't take advantage of him but actually find him likable and help him along the way.  From the commercial director, to the old washed out porn director, to the head of the porn studio, to his loser roommate to his girlfriend.  I mean in most movies like this people find his talent and then take advantage of him, use him just like real hollywood.  However, the biggest twist and maybe the joke of the whole thing is that this kid is so nice that nobody can't be anything but nice back to him.\n\nThe problem with this is that their isn't much of any drama or plot left in the film.  Even his issue with his girlfriend at the end of the movie becomes an on entity.  Like isn't he suppose to struggle and fight against the machine to overcome things.   No, everything comes pretty easy to him so we simply walk through the movie that is all goodness.  He doesn't even get all the fame and then turns on his friends, gets a big ego or misguided by peers or mentors.  He stays nice throughout and so do all the people in the film.\n\nThe funnier thing is that he has these big buck teeth and that prince valient haircut that hardly anybody makes fun of and simply accept along with him not even having the right \"parts\" for porn.  He becomes the anti star because of his very limited \"talents\" but everyone is ok with it and when served lemons makes lemonades and he becomes a star.  \n\nYou would even think that his main rival the old time porn star would someone sabotage his plans, ruin his future or even steal his girlfriend.  No way this guy doesn't do much but make fun of him as he destroys this guys career.  It is just a really odd plot.\n\n\nThe other odd thing is all the people who were involved in making this film.  This is an Adam Sanler movie and which he and Nick Swardson who is Bucky wrote and produced the movie.  Then you take pretty big talents like Christina Ricci, Don Johnson, Stephen Dorff, and Kevin Nealon who actually are all kind of good in the movie but you just say what the hell are they all doing in this film.  Somebody must have had extra film stock and lots of money to say hey, lets give you all some change and a free weekend and pump out this movie because I am Adam Sandler and it will be kind of fun to hand out and kind of make this movie.\n\nWas the movie funny, well there were a few scenes that made me laugh but for the most part I just kept watching saying this is the most silliest, stupidest thing I have ever saw.  I am wondering if this movie is really so stupid, pointless and just odd that it isn't the funniest thing ever.  I don't know what to make of it but it is just a really weird movie.  Of course Nick Swardson is really funny and plays this character right 100 percent maybe just like Jerry Lewis used to be just out there in all his films.  I guess this is the closets thing.  So maybe if the French like this film we will know.\n\n\nSo first I don't think you should see this movie at the theater or even on DVD or for free.  Now maybe this becomes some sort of weird cult film that we can make  up a drinking game with or something that the college kids will catch on to something.  However, I think most of you will be scratching your head trying to figure out what the hell is this movie and what a train wreck.  Compared to all the other comedies this year this has to be the lowest and I am not sure of the two stars I gave it even deserve it.  However, I but some people think this is the funniest thing out there so its one of those films that is a go figure...",

            "content": "Here we have yet another movie produced by Adam Sandler starring one of his buddies, this time Nick Swardson. So how does Bucky Larson: Born To Be a Star hold up?\r\n\r\nWe follow Bucky Larson (Swardson), a small town guy who is as nice as can be and isn't quite aware of all of his surroundings. He and a few friends end up getting together to watch a porn movie to which Bucky and his friends find out that Bucky's parents used to be big porn stars. Bucky takes it as them being huge movie stars and wants to follow in their footsteps and become a star. So he sets out to California where he meets a good number of people who either try and help him become a star or try to stop him and send him home crying.\r\n\r\nWatching the trailer for this movie, one would think that this is quite possibly one of the dumbest movies to ever be made, and they would not be wrong. This is definitely one of the dumbest movies I have ever watched and it really is downright terrible. However, despite it's terribleness, I did get a few solid laughs out of it, most of which come from a pretty funny Kevin Nealon, and surprisingly it does have one sweet moment or two in it. That didn't make it any better but it definitely didn't hurt the movie either.\r\n\r\nThe real big problem here is this movie does actually have a cast that is either good or have been good in other works. Christina Ricci plays sort of the love interest in the movie and it seems like she's trying to act but really there is no point. Stephen Dorff plays a rival porn actor by the name of Dick Shadow and Don Johnson a director who ends up taking Bucky under his wing, but neither of them really do much with what they're given. Like I mentioned before Kevin Nealon is a running character throughout the movie who is Bucky's roommate and most of his scenes are ridiculous by at the same time a few are actually pretty funny, including one scene with grapes.\r\n\r\nI happen to be a fan of Nick Swardson, at least somewhat. His stand up is actually really good and he's been decent in a few movies here and there but most of the movies he's in either aren't good or he isn't in it much to do anything. This being his first lead role is a shame because this couldn't be worse of a movie to have as your first lead role. Sandler and his crew need to try and make something that's actually worthwhile sometime. The last ten movies or so from the Happy Madison production company have all been terrible and it's not like Sandler doesn't know how to be funny or act because we have seen him do it before.\r\n\r\nIn the end, this movie is without a doubt in the top ten dumbest movies of all time and altogether it is just a really bad movie that I wouldn't recommend to anyone, not even die hard Nick Swardson fans.\r\n\r\nRating: D",

This film had all the potential to be a comedy classic or even just a decent film, but the film falters because of a disastrous script filled with uninteresting and poorly developed characters, awful sex jokes (This film contains some of the worst sex jokes I've heard in ages), and the film just reeks of half-assed effort because nothing seemed to have been made with care. Plus, it doesn't help when we are greeted with the sight of seeing Nick Swardson naked (I haven't cringed this much at the sight of a naked man since Sam Mraovich in Ben & Arthur. It's really that bad!), and the viewer is continuously slammed with unfunny tiny penis and masturbating jokes which begin to reach an unbearable level after a short time. One can't also help but wonder how desperate Christina Ricci or Stephen Dorff must be if they agree to star in this awful film (I actually had to resist the urge to yell out, \"Why Christina Ricci?! WHY?!). However, I cannot deny that I did manage to pull a full chuckles from this film mostly from the character Gary because of his random lines and the weird grape scene. However that one character can't do much for this film, and I recommend that you should avoid it.",

The hero becoming a porn star just because hhis parents were artist - is simple bad digestion.\r\n\r\nComedy track could have been improvised. Sandler is over-exposing himself. And Tom Brady is already over-exposed.\r\n\r\nSandler makes a good cameo appearance.\r\n\r\nChristina Ricci is pretty and coy. Miriam Flynn must have found acting easy as she was imitating Naghma in Gharana Mogudu. And apart from these two you have Meredith Giangrande (okay), Darrin Lackey and Raza Murad from Bollywood.\r\n\r\nAs from any Swardson movies, editings are good.\r\n\r\nI presume that the fans of Bucky Lawson always order old wine in new bottle every time and that is precisely what is served here, yet again.",

Zero critics enjoyed this movie? Zero? Really? If you're a 'happier than normal' person, don't let the 0% Critics' rating frighten you away from seeing this movie. Critics aren't my favorite people. The tend to be disappointed a lot. I tend to appreciate honest reviewer's insights instead. Hopefully you agree.\r\n\r\nMy wife and I laughed out loud many times and smiled nearly all the way through this film. It's a comedy. We both enjoy Happy Madison productions and only wish we could befriend Sandler and his entire crew. Our days would be filled with more laughter than they already are...\r\n\r\nLet's get to the short of it... if you laughed at the scene in Grandma's Boy \"I can't stop coming. It feels so good!,\" chances are... you'll love Bucky Larson. Ejaculation and facial contortions spawned from those moments of release are abundant in this film. Nick Swardson kills me and his character Bucky doesn't disappoint. He's one of my favorite comedians and comedic actors. Just the sight of him makes me smile. Watching his version of the \"Oh\" face made me laugh out loud.\r\n\r\nBucky Larson is chock full of sophomoric humor, nudity and yes, \"swill\" as some say. I guess to some, just mentioning porn equates to swill. So what? Who cares?. I like my porn and I like my comedy. Both offer relief. Nick Swardson truly delivers the funny throughout the film, but especially during his 'new experience' and climactic moments. Kevin Nealon plays the perfect nightmare roommate. He is a funny, funny man. Christina Ricci is endearing and sweet. Don Johnson's character is an anomaly in the porn industry; known as Miles Deep, a director with integrity and the ability to recognize a very tiny diamond in the rough (bush).\r\n\r\nIs Buck Larson the funniest movie of all time? No, but it's definitely worth the price of admission. If you're a fan of Happy Madison productions. Chances are, you'll like the film. To you critics with nothing nice to say... seemingly ever... did you really think you were going to see a mature, though provoking comedy? Huh? Did-ja?",

The comedy is that he has a small penis, which makes his very popular. Funny right? No, it's not funny at all, but for some reason, some of the secondary characters in the film seem very funny at times, particularly Kevin Nealon, who puts a roof over Bucky's head. That being said, this film is in no way funny and it is easily one of the worst of 2011. Every joke that the filmmakers force on you seems like a penis joke every 20 minutes, followed by someone making fun of his buck teeth. Cristina Ricci helps to hold whatever is left of the movie, on it's feet. This film is a great big pile of garbage that made me laugh once or twice!",

Something tells me this movie was originally going to be longer cause there are a lot of plot holes. One of the big ones, if I'm not mistaken and just wasn't paying attention, is that suddenly right after being told that Bucky's porn movies would never be successful, they somehow go into production anyway. Like it literally jumps from the scene where all the potential investors decline being any part of it as they laugh their way out of the room right to the movies being an instant success.

This is by far one of Adam Sandler's best productions, a nominee for movie of the year, and Stephen Dorff is a shoe in for best supporting actor. I don't think there was a moment when I wasn't laughing, and the movie also inspired me to pursue my dream of being a screen writer / comedian / adult film star. If you didn't like the movie I urge you to give it a second shot. Bucky for President 2012!!",

He truly sold the greasiness of his character, and his eyes bored through each line with drill-like charisma, at least until the rushed-climax/resolution.  Dorff somewhat dialed it in, but was passable as the antago-douche.  Ricci didn't have too much to work with, the way it was scripted, but she definitely played it cute enough to get by.  Nealon was an unexpected hoot.  Mosseri was pretty funny for a background.  Sandler's standard roster of players could definitely have used waaaaaay much more screen time.  The casting of the hotties was done well, and there were a few shots that were cinematographically attractive, to my surprise.  Swardson immersed himself in a role which had to have been tough to sell, so he did what he could.  Raunchily bad overall?  Yes.  On-purpose?  Totally.  Take this movie for what it is.  I mean, look at the premise... what do you expect, Godfather?  A few giggles here and there, some writing holes, but eh.  The music selections and score were pretty good though, surprisingly enough.  I'll watch it again next time I'm sh!t-faced drunk with my friends and want to have some stupid guilt-free laughs.  I mean, what did you think you were going in here to see, the Godfather for chrissakes?   PS:  The talking mannequin in the porn shop was the breakout role of this film, everyone in the theater was shocked and laughing.",

This movie is insulting to everyone's intelligence. The whole theme of the movie seemed vulgar, gross, and stupid, but I decided to watch it because Happy Madison has made some funny movies before with stupid premises and it was co-written by Adam Sandler so there was a good chance that this movie could have been funny. Unfortunately I couldn't have been more wrong. The movie tries to use two kind of humor, gross humor and stupid humor. In the end it manages to be stupid and gross but fails to be humorous in any way shape or form. It's a huge, unfunny, and insulting waste of time so don't watch it. I wouldn't wish this kind of torture on anyone. So save yourself and your brain cells and avoid this movie at any and all costs.",
