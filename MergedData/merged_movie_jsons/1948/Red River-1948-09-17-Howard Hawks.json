            "content": "Most people are going to enjoy this film. The story builds up well with some wonderful action set-pieces and montages, even though it could certainly benefit from further trimming. Coleen Gray making too much of her one scene would be twice as effective at half the length; and as for Joanne Dru, she doesn't belong in the film at all. True, she makes an extremely late entrance, but the story got along quite effectively without her. All she does is to slow down the pace and dissipate most of the tension. Mind you, the plot has some gaping holes. For instance, Wayne claims that he's too poor to buy some sacks of flour and few pounds of beans, yet he has no trouble engaging a band of badmen and buying them ammunition! And what a neat co-incidence that one of the pursuing Indians was wearing that charm bracelet that belonged - of course - to Wayne's mother! Wayne is his usual ruggedly roughshod self, Clift is less neurotic than usual, Brennan minus more teeth is more talkative than ever and even has an off-camera commentary as well! A fascinating assembly of support players includes the Careys, father and son (though the two never meet), Tom Tyler (briefly glimpsed), Paul Fix as a whinger saved from a hanging and Chief Yowlachie surprisingly amusing as a comic relief assistant cook and bottlewasher!",

            "content": "In the pantheon of great performances by John Wayne, Red River ranks as one of the great ones, probably in the top five of his films. It's what the publicity folks mean when they talk about epic westerns. John Wayne is a driven man, he's got to get that gigantic herd of cattle to market in Missouri or face ruin. He's not going to be selling them in Texas at carpetbagger prices so he's putting together the biggest, longest cattle drive on record to get to the railroad terminus in Missouri. He does it with the able assistance of his stepson Montgomery Clift newly returned from the Civil War.A prologue to the main film shows what happened to Wayne years before. He left a wagon train going to California with good friend Walter Brennan and later that train is massacred with Wayne's fianc\u00e9 Coleen Gray along with it. On the way to Texas, Wayne and Brennan pick up Mickey Kuhn who is playing a younger version of Monty Clift. They settle in Texas and Wayne puts together the biggest cattle ranch in the state which is where the main film starts.Wayne and Clift play beautifully off against each other. Father and surrogate son, first working together and then having a big difference of opinion on the cattle drive. Clift started a film career in Red River playing sensitive people who you can only trod on just so long before they take action. You can see the inner workings of such later Clift roles as Robert E. Lee Prewitt and Noah Ackerman. Monty made a grand screen debut. And it was his debut, Red River was filmed first, but held up in release and Clift's The Search was released first to the public.John Wayne had one of the best faces for movie closeups ever. In his best performances, top directors like John Ford, Howard Hawks, and Bill Wellman realized this. He has a few in this film and they tell the audience more about what's going on inside this man than ten pages of dialog. With Joanne Dru, Howard Hawks tries to repeat the magic he had with Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not. Joanne is no Bacall, but she's good and had a pretty good career on her own. Her scenes with both Wayne and Clift have some of the same bite that Bacall's do with Bogey.Dimitri Tiomkin's score deserves star billing right up there with the human cast. It is one of the great movie scores of all time period. let alone in the western genre. For me I've always noticed the similarity with the cattle drive beginning with the great use of Tiomkin's music and what Cecil B. DeMille did in the sound version of Ten Commandments as Charlton Heston tells the Hebrew children, he's takin' 'em to Canaan with Elmer Bernstein's score in the background as DeMille's cast of thousands moves out. I've often wondered whether DeMille copied Hawks, or Hawks was influenced by DeMille's silent Ten Commandments.Red River is a must, for John Wayne fans, for Monty Clift fans, for fans of both and of great movie music like I am.",

            "content": "Fourteen years ago Thomas Dunson entered Texas across Red River with two head of cattle, his trail hand, and a young boy, Matt Garth, who survived an Indian attack on a wagon train that killed Dunson's sweetheart.  After years of development he is now head of a ranch and is preparing to drive his head of thousands of cattle up to Missouri for sale, despite the perils.  However Dunson's brutal leadership style bucks up against the more peaceful Matt, leading to a rebellion and a splitting of the ways between Dunson and his adopted son.With an early scene establishing both Dunson's methods (taking land by force) and the source of much of his future bitterness and rage, this film sets itself out to be a real good character piece and pretty much manages to do it.  The plot sweeps across 14 years but doesn't suffer for it.  The main plot device is the cattle drive, which is depicted with affection here, however the main story is the conflict between Dunson and Matt's methods and views on man management.  This aspect is not given quite as much time as I had hoped and tends to be over shadowed by the scale of the cattle drive itself \u0096 however this is still good.The weakest point here is the romance which feels tacked on at the end.  Not only does it feel unnecessary but it doesn't really work very well either. To make matters worse \u0096 when the conflict between Dunson and Matt manifests itself physically, it is devalued by the involvement of Tess somewhat. Wayne's leading man is strong and is a good performance considering how unpopular he is as a character.  Clift gives a balanced performance and stands up well alongside the Duke.  The support cast is full of western favourites and does well to fill the story out with colour, comic relief from Brennan's chuck wagon driver is great fun.Overall this is a good western that I felt didn't quite reach it's full potential as a film.  It could have gone further with the battle of wills between the characters but instead the cattle drive takes the lion's share of screen time.  Having said that, there is still plenty to enjoy with both the character clashes and the perils of the cattle drive itself.",

By deep I mean John Wayne, Montgomery Clift, Walter Brennan, Harry Carey Sr., Noah Beery Jr., John Ireland, Joanne Dru, Coleen Gray, etc. This is more of a man's movie as those last two ladies listed both have small roles.In addition to the western action, you get some nice black-and-white cinematography. The cattle driving scenes are magnificently filmed. Wayne plays a \"Captain Bligh\" type of tyrant for most of the film, although he shows a few soft touches. Brennan has a great knack of making all his characters interesting, and this movie is no exception. Clift usually was pretty interesting, too.My only complaint is the length of the film. This could have been much better with a tighter script and about 15-20 minutes chopped off it. It's still a compelling story.",

            "content": "Red River(1948) is a film that gets better with age.  This was the first of five Howard Hawks/John Wayne features.  Red River(1948) was Howard Hawks third straight gem right after To Have & Have Not(1944) and The Big Sleep(1946).  John Wayne had come a long way from his low budget Lone Star film days.\nThe film is considered a Western take on The Mutiny on the Bounty.  The relationship between Tom Dunson and Matt Garth is deeply complex.  Although they're prepared to kill each other, deep down they still respect for one another.  This relationship is based on control, idealism, respect, and trust.\nIt takes a fascinating look at the cattle drive during the Wild West.  The film shows the responsbility that went with driving cattle across country and the different road blocks that many riders were faced with.  Red River(1948) shows that the cattle drives were a cowboy's main source of work.  City Slickers(1991) would do a wonderful homage to this Howard Hawks classic.\nTom Dunson, Ringo Kid, and Ethan Edwards to name a few are some of the best characters played by the duke.  He exhibits here that he was a great actor as well as a great Hollywood star.  Its a shame that his best performances were overlooked by by many people during his lifetime(he's definitely a superior actor compared to the likes of Stallone, Arnold, and Willis combined).  It was actually filmed during 1946 but was shelved for two year due to a legal battle with Howard Hughes.\nMontgomery Clift stands out on his own as Matt Garth in acting next to John Wayne.  Walter Brennan is excellent in the role of Tom Dunson's sidekick. Red River(1948) was one of the best film to come out of 1948.  Red River(1948) contains a trademark flirtious man-woman relationship between Matt Garth and Tess that also evident in some of the director's other works...I.E., His Girl Friday(Walter & Hildy), Ball of Fire(Potts & O'Shea), To Have & Have Not(Harry & Slim), The Big Sleep(Phillip Marlowe & Vivian Sternwood), and Rio Bravo(John T. Chance & Feathers).",

            "content": "From 1939 to 1948, two major Westerns done with taste and skill and with an eye to beauty could be mentioned: John Ford's \"Stagecoach,\" and Howard Hawks' \"Red River.\" \"Red River\" is a great adventure Western considered as the very best among all Westerns... But could we compared it to Ford's splendidly filmed \"Wagon Master\"? John Ford maintains his shooting eye at a certain distance while Howard Hawks keeps it nearby... But both are skilled directors of a bunch of great movies\u0085Ford is closer to Western movies, and Hawks to other genre... Ford treats his Western characters as people behave... Hawks displays it in vivid adventure... In \"Red River,\" \"Rio Bravo,\" and \"The Big Sky\" Howard Hawks is far from the magnitude of Ford's \"The Searchers.\" Under Ford's instruction, John Wayne is fluent and moderate, refined in conduct and manners as in \"The Quiet Man.\" With Hawks, Wayne's character prevails differential tendency toward passion and fury...It is soon evident that the cattle boss is tough to the point of obsession\u0085 It could be argued that only men of this spirit could have handled and survived the first pioneering cattle drives\u0085 One of the drovers (John Ireland) wants to make for Abilene but gets no change out of Wayne\u0085 When the cattle stampede Wayne goes to 'gun-whip' one of the hands, Clift intervenes\u0085 It was then evident that Wayne was going to drive his men just as hard as he intends to drive the cattle\u0085\"Red River\" is a Western just as much concerned with human relationships and their tensions as with spectacle and action\u0097a hallmark of Hawks' films and this element is introduced when the pair meet up with a boy leading a cow\u0085 The boy confirms the wagon-train massacre, and the boy and the cow from then on are included in the partnership\u0085 This is not only a key-point of the narrative but also a highly symbolic moment\u0085For some years Garfield was the only screen rebel... But in Clift's appearance in \"Red River,\" another rebel was born\u0085 In \"Red River,\" Clift plays the adopted son who opposes his father's domineering attitudes and behavior towards himself and also towards the cowhands who work for them on the drive to market\u0085 The struggle between father and adopted son, compels delighted interest... Dunson's unfeeling hardhearted style remembers us Captain Bligh in \"Mutiny on the Bounty.\" In the beginning of the film we had admiration for Wayne's persona... We concluded finding him unfriendly, unconscious, unacceptable and faulty... Clift wins our sympathy! Clift was the withdrawn, introverted man who quietly maintains his integrity as he resists all pressures\u0085 These qualities were summed up in the words of Private Prewitt in \"From Here to Eternity\" probably Clift's finest rebel role! \"Red River\" will remain a film with a unique flavor\u0085 It has, and will continue to have, its own special niche among honored Westerns\u0085 With two Academy Award Nomination for Writing, splendid music score by Dmitri Tomkin and excellent acting including the supporting cast, the film had all the concepts of Howard Hawks' quality: vigor in action, reality as opposed to emotions and a faculty of scale...",

            "review_title": "Very well made, amazing scenery, some great acting, though all a bit formulaic",
            "content": "Red River (1948)A Western with a huge cattle drive at its core. John Wayne plays the head rancher, and among his workers and upstarts are a son-like youngster (Montgomery Clift) and a old-timer best friend (Walter Brennan). There are rivalries, Indians, opposing ranchers, and a woman or two who each intrude or help out Wayne in various ways. A Howard Hawks Western is about as close as you can get to a John Ford Western. Ford is the one who re-discovered a languishing John Wayne in 1939, and Hawks was a parallel director, about the same age, specializing in male-dominated adventure dramas. But Hawks also directed some amazing other kinds of films, including a few classic screwball comedies, the terrific \"Only Angels Have Wings,\" and some film noirs including his film before this one, \"The Big Sleep.\"So I expected something really special here and in fact this is well done all around. But it falls into so many of the already established stereotypes of the genre, I was surprised and had to keep my disappointment in check. Wayne is terrific as the kind of John Wayne you'd expect, and Brennan is the earthy, witty, likable type he always plays. It is probably Montgomery Clift who shines best, here in his first year in Hollywood, just before \"The Heiress\" and a string of other great films. This is apparently his first major acting role, as the film was shot in 1946, though another movie, \"The Search\" (which is very good), was released first.It's interesting to see co-directing status for Arthur Rosson (the photographer's brother), partly because Hawks would not seem to need a second hand. But then that points to some of the really complex scenes here--mostly shot on location and with easily hundreds if not a thousand or more actual cattle. You realize as you watch this long trek through the low dry hills that the actors on horses are having to really move the cattle through this country for the filming. I'm sure they have help, and all those extras must have been good hired hands. It's still pretty neat to watch that aspect, going for example through a wide river.In a way you can get fully invested in the movie based on the action and the acting and the characters. Directly. They are strong, believable, and their lines are well written. It's the plot that will seem to fall into familiarity too often for many of you.",

            "content": "Some people think this is the greatest western ever made and they aren't far off the mark. It is certainly among the most expansive. Borden Chase adapted his own Saturday Evening Post story \"The Chisholm Trail\" but it was Howard Hawks who fleshed it out. There are some who see the relationship between Tom Dunson, (John Wayne), and his surrogate son Matthew Garth, (Montgomery Clift), as mirroring that of Captain Bligh and Fletcher Christian and again that isn't too far off the mark either. Then there is the teasingly suggestive homo-erotic by-play that exists between Clift and gunslinger John Ireland, with a lot of emphasis on the affection each shares for the other's gun. But pat psychology aside the film is chiefly enjoyable for its sheer physicality. Indian attacks, gunfights, cattle stampedes and a great climatic confrontation between Wayne and Clift, it has them all.Clift, a relative newcomer when the film came out, (it was only his second picture), is excellent. The camera loves him and he knows it. This is Clift at his most likable and laconic. But it is Wayne's tyrannical Tom Dunson who dominates every scene. It's a great piece of acting, the equal of his work in \"The Quiet Man\" and \"The Searchers\", maybe better. Those who say he was the same in every picture were surely blinkered. Given a great part like Dunson or Ethan Edwards he clearly understood the psychology of the role and what made the character tick. And for once, Dimitri Tiomkin's great score adds to, rather than detracts from, the film. Trivia time; in Peter Bogdanovitch's \"The Last Picture Show\" it was Hawk's \"Red River\" that was the last picture show.",

This causes division, resulting in Matt taking the herd away from his adopted father, incurring the wrath from a vengeful Tom Dunson...Reasonably entertaining film doesn't really have anyone in particular to root for, since both men had valid points, and the showdown at the end is anti-climatic.

            "content": "Dimitri Tiomkin's thunderous score sets the tone for this rousing story of cowboy ranchers in nineteenth century Texas headed north, with a thunderous herd of cattle in tow. It's the archetypal story of the American West, with its strong, ethical male leader, Thomas Dunson (John Wayne), and his pursuit of a big dream, set in an era when men were men, times were tough, hardships were inevitable, guns ruled, and Native Americans were the bad guys. What a saga ...What makes \"Red River\" such a grand adventure is its high quality. Its story is simple, direct, exciting, and well told, with complex characters, interesting and sympathetic because they show weakness as well as strength. Dunson is a good man, but he's stubborn and headstrong. His semi-adopted son, Matt (Montgomery Clift), is good with a gun but a little softhearted. Dunson's chief sidekick is Groot (Walter Brennan), a cantankerous old buzzard who has problems with his teeth.It's the relationship between these three men that is the heart and soul of \"Red River\". Trouble ensues along the way, you can be sure. And how that trouble unfolds and plays out presents viewers with engaging human drama, and humor, centered on these three main characters. The lonesome High Plains, with all its inherent risks, adds grandeur to the epic story.At strategic points in the film, the page of a book appears on screen with text that briefly summarizes upcoming events. It's like we, the viewers, are reading a book about some long ago trailblazers. It's a technique that could have been intrusive. But here, it is handled with such finesse that it actually helps the narrative, by functioning as a transition from one sequence to the next.The acting is fine. John Wayne is more than convincing as Dunson. Walter Brennan is characteristically funny. And Montgomery Clift is terrific. Had he maintained his looks, and if real-life circumstances not intervened, Monty could have been one of the truly top actors through at least the 50s and 60s.If the film has a weakness, it might be the cinematography. Not often, but at times, the actors appear to be standing in front of a canvas, an effect that renders a shallow depth of field. Maybe this was the result of technical limitations of photography at the time the film was made.There are few film westerns that can compare in quality with \"Red River\". And I don't know of any other cinematic cattle drives that are this good. So, the next time you herd your cattle to market, this is the film to watch. Even if you have no cattle, \"Red River\" is still a wonderfully entertaining cinematic experience.",

But what soon becomes clear about Red River is that the supporting characters (such as Montgomery Clift as Wayne's son, Walter Brennan as one of the fellow Cattle drivers, Joanne Dru as the lady of the bunch, and Harry Carey as a cattle buyer) bring out a greater sense of humanity to the film, and there are scenes captured by Hawks and his cameraman Russell Harlan that are, for lack of a better word, glorious. Whatever minor flaws come up from the characters is made up by the storytelling qualities of the final product.  I'd have to see it again (it was months ago I first viewed it) to know for certain if it's one of the all time best westerns- as some might say- yet from what I saw it is an impressively executed tale.

The constant fall in the value of livestock means that Tom, and his adopted son Matthew, must drive the gathered herd through the perilous Chisholm Trail, and then hope to get good value for the beef. With their assembled group of hands they head off North, but many problems will come their way, not least, a fallout due to Dunson's tyrannical ways, meaning there could well be mutiny on the range.Without a shadow of doubt, Red River is one of the greatest Westerns ever made, boasting incredible performances from the cast, directed with sumptuous skill by Howard Hawks and photographed as good as any film in the genre. Based on the novel The Chisholm Trail written by Borden Chase (also co writing duties for the film), Red River is a sweeping spectacle that doesn't have a frame that's wasted. Hawks (this his first Western) frames his wonderfully vivid characters in lush expansive landscapes, fleshing them out amongst the constant stream of drama and action. Though Chase would be annoyed at the changes Hawks made to the story, he surely would have marvelled at the finished product, with Harlan's photography in and around the Arizona's locales capturing a cowboys terrain expertly, while Dimitri Tiomkin's score stirs the blood and pumps the viewer with Cowboy adrenaline.If anyone doubts John Wayne as an actor of note then they need look no further than his performance here as Dunson. Tough and durable in essence the character is for sure, but Wayne manages to fuse those traits with a believable earthy determination that layers the character perfectly. With Wayne all the way, matching him stride for stride is Montgomery Clift as Matthew Garth, sensitive without being overly so, it's the perfect foil to Wayne's machismo barnstorming. Walter Brennan and John Ireland also shine bright in support, while a special mention has to go to a wonderful turn from Joanne Dru as Tess Millay, for Howard Hawks' CV shows a ream of strong female characters, and here Dru firmly puts herself in amongst the best of them - check out her first appearance alongside Clift, it's precious.Red River made a fortune upon its release, it was revered by the critics back then, and it's still being revered today. Rightly so, because it is quite simply magic cinema, a case where everything comes together perfectly, it's in short, a film that even none Western fans should be able to marvel at as entertainment. Or? at the very least give credit to the Tech accomplishments on offer. 10/10",

            "review_title": "Mutiny on the cattle drive",
            "content": "\"Red River\" sees actor John Wayne playing Thomas Dunson, a mean-tempered cattle rancher who hopes to drive a large herd of cattle from Texas to Missouri with the help of a dozen men. Unfortunately, due to Dunson's tyrannical leadership methods, the men rebel against him. Led by Dunson's adopted son Matt, played by Montgomery Cliff, they usurp Dunson, taking his guns and cattle and making the journey to Missouri themselves.The film was directed by Howard Hawks, and so bears all his hallmarks: strong masculine characters, swift pacing, much male camaraderie, strong willed (and sexy) woman, obsessive characters, moral codes in conflict, rapid-fire dialogue etc etc. What's different here is cinematographer Russell Harlan's photography and Hawks' camera-work. For a Hawks film, \"Red River\" is surprisingly fluid, elegant, spacious and visually driven. The film is a loose retelling of Norman and Nordhoff's \"Mutiny on the Bounty\", but with its attention to detail and meticulous cataloguing of \"little moments\", also comes across as a fairly realistic documentation of life on the cattle drive. And of course Wayne gives one of the best performances of his career. A performance which helped undermine his \"heroic image\" and foreshadowed murkier performances in \"The Searchers\", \"True Grit\" and \"The Shootist\". The most interesting thing about \"River\", though, is the psycho-sexual weirdness going on beneath the film's surface. In real life, Hawks strongly resisted both femininity and emotional relationships. While many of the director's early characters oozed a kind of \"invulnerable masculinity\", Hawks himself had a deep-seated aversion to maintaining strong, emotional bonds with the many women, lovers and children in his life. His biographer, Todd McCarthy, even goes so far as to say that Hawks' womanising was a means of avoiding emotional depth, commitment and the responsibilities of a mature relationship. As such, Hawks' films tend to avoid married couples or couples who have been together for a long time. What he's interested in is that initial romantic spark, and goes to lengths to deny the feminine within himself, and within his male and his female characters. This repression would give rise to his later comedies (\"Bringing up Baby\", \"I Was A Male War Bride\"), which tend to revolve around insecurities over the instabilities (and arbitrariness) of gender. And so \"River\" is all about confusion, repression, the discomfort with male weakness, guilt and the inability to act. Here, Wayne is both a mother and father figure toward Matt, plucking the boy out of the desert, nurturing him and then watching him grow. As Matt grows, he becomes an effeminate, rather liberal figure, striking up odd homo-erotic conversations with other gunmen and often refusing to use his gun. Meanwhile, Wayne grows increasingly authoritarian, murderous and stubborn, until the two find themselves vying for a woman called Tess. Tess, who is rescued from Native American Indians, mirrors Wayne's wife, who was killed by Indians at the start of the film. Tess then gives herself to Matt, but the fact that Wayne wants her to carry his own child suggests that Tess is both a mother and lover to Matt. The film's ending is hated by even die-hard fans. Here, Matt and Wayne have a little showdown, the father wishing to kill the son (and by extension claim Tess as his own). Matt, in contrast, refuses to resort to violence. For a while it looks like Wayne will murder the kid, until Tess steps in and magically heals their rift. The film then ends with a new family being formed, Wayne the daddy, Matt the son and Tess the son's new wife. Daddy has been neutered, but not in the conventional Oedipal way (by the son). It's a jarring ending, and very insulting in the way it casually brushes aside the deaths and troubles these two men caused, but the Oedipal implications are nevertheless interesting. Here's the son's refusal to resort to the gun is viewed as an essential improvement upon Wayne's trigger-happy frontier justice. This is common of westerns. Matt becomes the new American, a reconciliation of two paradigms: savagery/barbarism and civility/chivalry. It is no coincidence that it is a band of marauding Indians who brings Matt and Wayne to Tess and robs Wayne of his own wife. Covertly, the film presents the slaughter of the \"red skins\" (and Wayne's own white, tyrannical violence) as just another hurdle to be overcome on the way to better things. But though the film probes the barbarity of colonising the west (When exactly does the use of force condoned by Manifest Destiny end? Who can stop the regime of violence? Who dares propose a more moderate programme? Once law and order replaces guns, how does society deal with the perpetrators of violence? How does civilisation handle the violence at the core of its creation?) it quickly expiates that which it acknowledges. In the film, there are no blood ties, no genetic links, connecting Matt to Wayne, and Wayne's character ultimately remains celebrated. This \"trauma avoidance\" is typical of the genre. \"The ethics of Western violence coincide with the imperatives of entrepreneurial ideology which are the core of the political-economic mythology of the United States,\" historian Richard Soltkin says. \"However, the Western deflects, masks or denies the validity of economic self-interest \u2013 \"greed\" \u2013 which is the motivating principle of that ideology. In this way, Westerns offer a vehicle in which the culture can both affirm its values and express its doubts and ambivalence.\" And so for all its probing, Wayne's actions never make much sense, and even if they did, the film says it doesn't matter anyway. He's a good guy now, and has been replaced by an even better one. Turn Wayne into Sgt Barnes and Tess into Sgt Elias and you'd have the Hollywood wound-licking of Oliver Stone's \"Platoon\", Vietnam/The Wild west superficially resurrected, the monsters atoned and the world healed for tomorrow's generation of good little children. 7.9/10 \u2013 Worth one viewing.",

            "review_title": "One of John Wayne's Best Performances",
            "content": "In Texas 1851, Thomas Dunson (John Wayne) is bringing his cattle to Red River, when his adopted son Matthew Garth (Montgomery Clift) turns against him.Director John Ford was the undisputed master of the western, and the man who launched John Wayne to stardom in \"Stagecoach\" (1939). That being said, it is no surprise that when Howard Hawks made \"Red River\", his first western, he consciously used Ford as his marker. This paid off. While relatively few of Hawks' overall output was westerns, he may be best remembered for this film and \"Rio Bravo\".Both Ford and Hawks are now considered the best in the western genre, though the edge is still Ford's. While Ford was the first to admit that Hawks got the best performance of Wayne's career (up to this point) out of \"Red River\", Ford still has the more iconic western films overall. And Hawks probably did his best work in other genres, or through no specific genre at all. Geoffrey O'Brien wrote that Hawks was \"inclined more toward unsentimental comedy than soul-searching melodrama.\" (With regards to Wayne's acting, his acting is indeed melodramatic at times, but less so here than in other roles.)Allegedly, there was some concern that John Wayne and Montgomery Clift would not get along due to political reasons and Clift's known homosexuality. In some ways, this background is more interesting than the film itself. Imagine an openly gay man co-starring alongside Wayne and Walter Brennan. Wayne actively tried to get Clift thrown off the set, rumors started that he was having an affair with John Ireland... and when Clift was offered a role in \"Rio Bravo\", he turned the part down to avoid Wayne.The homosexuality may even have been written in as a subtext. There is the scene between Ireland and Clift, where they compare guns and take each other's measure by \"walking\" a can across the ground with their pistol shots, which is now a film classic. The odd thing is that Ireland may not have been gay, so how the rumor has spread is unclear. (Further confusing the matter is that if this was Clift's first acting gig, how were his politics and sexuality known quantities to the other stars?)Walter Brennan's distinctive voice is good for some subtle humor, and Montgomery Clift looks like Tom Cruise in his prime when he wears a hat. Clift is better as a priest (\"I Confess\") than a cowboy, though. Clift was apparently directed by Hawks to play down his acting around Wayne, even to hide behind a coffee cup so as not to steal a scene, so we have to give him a little credit, even if this is not his best work.Interesting, when John Wayne was asked about what film he considered his best, this did not immediately come to mind. Instead, after listing several others, he said this film has the best cattle drive of his films. That says very little, though it does call to mind the brilliance of the 360-degree shot that Hawks used to give the impression of thousands of cattle when they only had hundreds. Look for the cuts and you likely will not find them.If editor Christian Nyby is to be believed, and there is no reason to doubt him, much of the film's success actually falls on him. At one point, Hawks was over budget and was shooting too much material, while his two editors were not bringing forth a decent film from all this. Nyby was called in by Hawks as a favor (after convincing Jack Warner to loan him out) and worked on \"Red River\" at night while editing Raoul Walsh's \"Fighter Squadron\" (1948) during the day. He received a much-deserved Oscar nomination for this.The Criterion Collection released the film in 2014, and gave it the royal treatment: two versions of the film, the picture cleaned up to the best it has ever looked, a great interview with Peter Bogdanovich. On top of this, a nice booklet and even the original story the film is based on. Definitely a must-own for fans.",

            "content": "Highly watchable and classic Hawks epic about a grueling cattle drive Western and a confrontation between father and son . Tom Dunson (John Wayne , Hawks originally offered the role of Thomas Dunson to Gary Cooper) builds a cattle empire with his adopted son Matthew Garth (Montgomery Clift first movie , but because it was shelved for 2 years, the first film the public saw of Clift was \u00a8The search\u00a8, which he was Oscar-nominated for). Tom decides to make a dangerous Trek North , refusing to listen to any advice from his son . Together they begin a cattle drive north from Texas to the Missouri railhead . But on the way, new information and Dunson's tyrannical manners cause Matthew to take over the herd away from obsessed Tom and head to a new railhead in Kansas. Then Dunson, swearing revenge . This sprawling flick deals with the first cattle drive from Texas to Abilene (a biblical name meaning city of the plains), along the Chisholm Trail .Abilene was the first of the major railhead cattle towns . From 1867 to 1872 it was a booming depot , shipping some one million Texas Longhorns by railroad to Kansas City and Chicago and meat markets in the East . The place was selected as a terminus for Texas cattle drives in 1867 . Then the long drives began from Texas over the Chisholm trail . At trail's end in Abilene the rowdy,free-spending cowboys attracted saloon keepers, gamblers , brothels and all types of frontier Riff-Raff , the town became notorious for its lawlessness . Gunmen were hired for a time to keep the peace in Abilene . With the numerous presence of homesteaders the town prospered , stabilized and grew , its lawabiding citizens decided to discourage the troublesome cattle trade with his transient cowboys and early requested the Texas cattlemen to drive their herds elsewhere , which they soon did and Abilene's role as a wild cow town came to an abrupt ending.The picture gets thrills , action Western , shootouts , a love story , a violent battle of wits between father and adopted son ; being quite entertaining . It's a big budget film with good actors , technicians, production values , pleasing results and usually regarded as one of the Westerns ever made . Interesting screenplay based on a serial published in \u00a8Saturday Evening Post\u00a8 in which subsequently Borden Chase wrote a book titled \u00a8Blazing guns on the Chisholm trail\u00a8 . The famous scene where Montgomery Clift and John Ireland compare their revolvers was allegedly a reference to John Ireland's endowment, it may also be a reference to Clift's homosexuality. Howard Hawks was distressed by John Ireland's unprofessional and lecherous behavior during filming, which were partially due to the actor's alcoholism , this contributed to Ireland's part, \"Cherry Valance\", being drastically reduced in the finished film. In spite of , a bit later on , John Ireland married Joanne Dru , film's starring and Montgomery's very nominal interest . At one point, Cary Grant was in consideration for the part , though he turned it down . Dazzling scenarios and impressive production design , including thousands of cows . Towering acting from main cast playing larger-than-life characters as John Wayne as obsessed Tom who owns a sprawling cattle empire , and Montgomery Clift giving one of his most enjoyable and least complicated acting . Great supporting cast headed by three-time Academy Award winner Walter Brennan , John Ireland , Hank Worden , Paul Fix , Noah Beery , Coleen Gray and the only film that father, Harry Carey, and son, Harry Carey Jr. appeared together in . The great veteran Harry Carey Senior , whose last movie this was , and to whom its is dedicated . Musical composer Dimitri Tiomkin's rousing soundtrack , the theme song, \"Settle Down\" was later adapted by the score's author, Dimitri Tiomkin, and sung by Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson under the title \"My Rifle, My Pony and Me\" in R\u00edo Bravo, another John Wayne western directed by Howard Hawks . Evocative cinematography by Russell Harlan , though Hawks originally wanted Gregg Toland as his director of photography , when Toland proved unavailable, he had to go with Harlan instead. Subsequently was restored and realized a colorized version , furthermore a remake for TV (1988) with James Arness and Bruce Boxleitner . Grand scale movie stunningly directed by Howard Hawks at his pinnacule , being supported by Arthur Rosson in 2\u00ba unit and by excellent editor Christian Nyby . Realized in sure visual eye , it ranked #5 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre \"Western\" and was 1948's third highest grossing film at $4,150,000. Rating : A Western masterpiece , above average , essential and indispensable seeing .",

            "content": "The 1940s were the decade when the Western came of age. After years languishing in the B-movie doldrums during the 1930s, the genre had made a triumphal comeback with pictures of increasing stature and importance. Many of these 40s Westerns explored and restated the popular clich\u00e9s of the cowboy movie. More importantly, they recognised, for the first time since the early 30s, that the old west could be a setting for stirring and powerful stories.Red River proves this point, using the plains and cattle drives as a backdrop for a tale of loyalty, love and the trials of life, with a scope as vast as the West itself. The screenplay is by Borden Chase, who wrote many classic Westerns, and Charles Schnee, a dramatic writer who would win an Oscar for The Bad and the Beautiful, and their two divergent strands blend beautifully. The story has a deep impact because it is a masterwork in build-up and pay-off. Take for example the character played by Harry Carey Jr., who exists in the plot purely to be the human victim of a stampede. We first see him in the scene where the men sign up for the drive, when he stands up just after another man has made his excuses for not coming along. We think he is also wanting to stay behind, and John Wayne says as much, but Carey is in fact expressing his willingness. This moment makes us remember him, and perhaps the thought will cross our minds that he's a bit of a young lad to be going out on the drive. It makes his death later in the picture really mean something. On a wider scale a similar thing is done with Wayne's character. The loss of his woman is described in a brief handful of scenes at the beginning. He is never seen referring to this again, but if affects the way we see the character and seems to feed into everything he does.These aspects of the story are brought out with great depth by director Howard Hawks. Those crucial opening moments are played out in a series of iconic images which, in spite of their brevity, linger in the mind for the duration of the picture \u2013 Wayne and Colleen Gray in a wild embrace, the tiny wagon upon the landscape, the Indians rushing towards us. Throughout, Hawks is constantly telling the story, or at least delineating the characters through visual means. In the scene where Wayne argues with another man over the quality of the coffee and says they won't turn back, Montgomery Clift is placed between them, and while the two men speak it's his reactions we see. When Joanne Dru first appears it looks as if she is just an extra, but she is in fact centre screen and a light is on her face, so we take note of her before she becomes a character. Few directors were as good as Hawks at emphasising the actions over the words. Notice how those handwritten title cards begin to fade out before you've had a chance to read them entirely \u2013 that's because the words don't really matter.The two leading stars of Red River at first seem an unlikely pairing. On the one hand we have John Wayne, already intrinsically associated with the genre before this era, having starred in numerous B-westerns in the 30s. On the other we have a complete newcomer in Montgomery Clift, handsome rather than rugged, with a background in theatre. And yet they complement each other brilliantly. Wayne seems hewn out of very rock of the mountains, which makes it all the more poignant when he shows a bit of sensitivity, in what is the first of his truly great acting performances. Clift by comparison is so lithe and innocent-looking, that he has all the more impact when he eventually stands up for himself and fights. Somewhere these two very different actors meet each other halfway, and this is what makes their rocky father-son relationship work.With all this bright storytelling and powerful acting, not to mention the rousing and evocative Dmitri Tiomkin score, Red River adds up to more than the sum of its parts. It is not merely a great Western, it is a part of Western mythology. Unlike many of the pictures from its time, it features few of the clich\u00e9s with which the genre is saturated, but is nevertheless rich in the Western's familiar imagery. This is the West of Russell and Remington, the world that all those elegiac Westerns a decade or so later would be mourning the loss of. It is pictures like this that elevate the Western from a mere historical setting to a genre in its own right.",

John Wayne is full of machismo and a hard American frontiersman. In other westerns, he is the heroic protagonist. It's not quite so simple here although many would still root for him.

            "content": "An extended 360-degree shot on the cattle, a religious silence, John Wayne addresses Montgomery Clift with the legendary \"Take'em to the Missouri, Matt\" and then all the cowboys wave their hats in the air, yelling \"hee-haw\" in a thrilling close-up montage. If only for this scene, \"Red River\" deserved its spot on the American Film Institute's Top 10 Westerns. They're all riding horses, herding cattle in a vast space, under a blue sky, in the perfect communion between men and nature. It's all about the exhilarating of being a cowboy and all about watching them on the big screen. That's the reason why this iconic part is referenced in Peter Bogdanovich' \"The Last Picture Show\" or \"City Slickers\". More than a Western, Howard Hawks' classic is the ultimate theater's movie, that you can't watch without wondering how the sight of the epic cattle; cows and bull crossing the river, the heart-pounding stampede or the simple \"Yee-ha\" scene would have felt on a big screen.Given that, what's left from the experience when you watch it on TV? Well, I guess \"Red River\" wouldn't have been half the revered classic it is, if it was just a great spectacle. There is a reason why people remember \"Red River\" better than the pompous all-star casted \"How the West Was Won\" for the film is more complex and even more brilliant, and the thrills come less from the scenes involving the cattle than the central relationship between Mr. Dunson and Matthew Garth, John Wayne as the tough self-made ranch owner, and Montgomery Clift as the soft-hearted fast-gun adopted son.The movie opens when Dunson leaves a trail wagon in 1851, the leader asks him to stay, but Dunson says it better, if he signed, he'd stay. This line isn't unjustified; it helps to set the character as a man of his word. Later, he wouldn't accept anyone who quits HIS trail, because those who accepted signed, and he wouldn't accept for himself what he wouldn't do for others: being disloyal. Again, Dunson strikes as a rational man who has everything figured out, only he waits for the right time and the right moment, he might be wrong or right, but he sticks to his ideas. This is John Wayne in one of his most defining roles. The only man who follows him is the cook, Groot, played by the most beloved and recognizable character actor of the Golden Age: Walter Brennan. He never questions Dunson's decisions but he's not a one-dimensional sidekick either. His seemingly blind obedience makes such line as \"you was wrong, Mr. Dunson\" more powerful. In their road, they find a traumatized little boy with a cow, he's got nowhere to go, and with one bull left, Dunson has enough to start with. He wants to brand his cows with a D and the 'Red River' symbol, why not a \"M\", argues Matt, that's for him, to earn. Dunson is a man with ambition, guts and a soft spot for Matt, who could be the son he'd never have, much more, when the only woman he ever loved ends up killed in an Indian attack. The film never paint his actions with a sympathetic line either, I don't think we're supposed to cheer up when he kills the Mexican, while a bullet in his hand would have been enough warning, but it's a reminder about the toughness of the times, when men, caught in a savage territory, made a surviving rather than a living, and only at that price was the Old West won. Later, when Dunson tells Matt that \"he's soft\", it's also a way to tell him, that he'd never have succeeded with his heart. Yet even if Dunson built a great ranch with his own hands, he was still broken after the War, and forced him to herd the cattle till Missouri to sell it at a good price. The film can mislead by making us think of a rivalry between Cherry Valance (John Ireland) and Matt, but as the road gets tougher, as Dunson becomes a tyrant whose leadership is discussed, the heart of the story turns to be the conflict between Matt and Dunson. \"Red River\" is the coming-of-age story of Matt, who, by challenging his father in a sort of Oedipian impulse, will be able to prove his value. Fathers are the kind of persons who tell sons what to do unless they're proved wrong. When he plans to conduct the cattle to Abilene because there was a railroad, which the stubborn Dunson didn't believe, Matt had the opportunity, to \"kill\" his father symbolically.Except that Wayne is no man to \"kill\" symbolically when he promises revenge. The film leaves uncertain the ending keeping our hearts hooked to the cowboy's growing paranoia, feeling Dunson's spectra on their shoulders and that's part of the film's greatness, and a credit to John Wayne's aura who doesn't need to be here, to be here. Ultimately, \"Red River\" is a fascinating father-and-son relationship study that confronts two views on life, a stubborn old-school rancher and a romantic opportunistic go-getter, it's also a confrontation between two generations, the no no-sense and the tormented actor. Both are so blinded by their own egos it's no wonder, a woman who will finally open their hearts. But I could have done with another ending, and even with no women at all, \"Red River\" is a man's film, and whether it's for the melodramatically corny farewell scene of the beginning or the unrealistic dialog during an Indian attack, the film kind of loses it with the women. Hawks said that a good film was made of three good scenes and no bad scene, I can count a few bad scenes, but maybe in this case, we can forgive it because \"Red River\" is one hell of a Western \u0085 Yee-ha!",

            "content": "\"Red River\" is an unusual movie in a number of ways. First, it's one of a very few films about a large cattle drive. Second, it's an epic Western. Most of the film time covers the drive of a thousand miles that takes 100 days to complete. Third - while filmed in southern Arizona, the film shows unspoiled scenery that is common along the area of the cattle drive that ran from Southwest Texas to Abilene, Kansas.Of course, there's more of a plot woven into this story. It was a never-before tried cattle drive of 10,000 head of cattle. It's about Thomas Dunson and his sidekick Nadine Groot who set out for Texas to build a ranch, and a lone boy survivor of an Indian attack whom Dunsan raises. Now, the young Matt Garth is a man who has returned home after serving in the Civil War.It's an interesting story with some feuding among the hands, and people choosing sides. The cast all are very good. John Wayne is Thomas Dunson and Montgomery Clift is Matt Garth. It was Clift's first film and a sizable co-starring role for a first-timer. But he came off 10 years in Broadway where he had established his credentials as an actorA fine supporting cast fills out this film, all with meaty roles, starting with Walter Brennan as Groot. John Ireland plays Cherry Valance. Harry Carey and Harry Carey Jr. Are both in the film. Noah Beery Jr. Is Buster McGee and Paul Fix plays Teeler Yacey. Joanne Dru has the main female role as Tess Millay and Coleen Gray plays Fen.In the movie, Dunson and Groot cross the Red River, probably where it starts across the Texas Panhandle. From there East, the river forms the border between Oklahoma and Texas. The men keep heading south and after awhile they meet up with a couple of Mexican caballeros who say they are welcome to visit but that the land is owned by a man who lives in Mexico. Dunson tells them that he is taking over the land north of the Rio Grande, and they can tell their boss that he can continue to have the land south of the border.At the time of the film, the railroads were just starting across the West. Dunson's original plan was to drive the herd to Missouri. But after Garth takes over, they head for Abilene, Kansas, on the word of some men that the railroad is supposed to be there. Dunson rounds up some men to pursue them. They have a showdown at Abilene.The popularity of Westerns has declined significantly, along with many other genres, since before the end of the 20th century. And any films of this type that may be made in the future will no longer have such large expanses of scenery with really large herds of cattle. Instead, such films will use much CGI with fill-in numbers to give the allusion of large herds and scenic expanses.",

Paid $1200.00 for it (Canadian funds!)and ALL my friends told me I was nuts.  I TRIED to tell them that, eventually, everybody would own a VCR but was shouted down. In any case, Red River was the first movie I taped and, deleting commercial breaks, I was ecstatic to have a Hollywood movie on hand to watch whenever the urge arose. And WHAT A MOVIE!!!  I agree with earlier comments re John Wayne...who usually just played John Wayne.  In THIS one, and \"The Searchers\", however, the director got one helluva performance out of the Duke.  Also, the second movie performance by the tragical Montgomery Clift...so \"pretty\" in the Mohammed Ali sense that I virtually fell in love with him myself, even though I was a \"straight\" teenaged boy. From the opening credits, with that almost Wagnerian music by Dmitri Tiomkin, this movie (shot in 1946 and held 'til 1948 for release...I forget why)should be compulsory viewing for the brain-dead Hollywood moguls of today.  Actually, there are no \"moguls\" left...they're all bottom-line money men who wouldn't know a good movie if they saw one...\"Let's check the demographics, guys, and fill those multiple screen outlets with brain-dead teens (not really their fault as products of our so called progressive p.c. education system)and make a TON of money!\" My age is showing...back to the movie.  If you haven't seen it, be prepared for a LONG sojourn.  This isn't brain candy...it's an allegorical treatise on the impetuousness of youth vs. the inflexible values of pioneer stock. In the end, BOTH are told to cut themselves some slack, by the \"gun-totin\" Joanne Dru. In summary, a Great Western, and to get back to the Duke, an amazing performance by a 39 year old made up to look like a 60 year old...and he pulled it off!  The respect/fear combo of his hired trailhands is almost Shakespearian, and a tribute to the screenwriter/s and director Howard Hawks.

            "review_title": "The First & Greatest Western About Herding Cattle!",
            "content": "Producer & director Howard Hawks set the bar so high that not even he could surpass himself when he helmed his first and greatest western, \"Red River,\" with John Wayne and Montgomery Clift. Hawks bought Borden Chase's serialized \"Saturday Evening Post\" story \"The Chisholm Trail\" about the first big historic cattle drive between Texas and Kansas and turned it into this sprawling, spellbinding horse opera. The closest any of Hawks' contemporaries ever came to matching his masterpiece was Raoul Walsh's \"The Tall Men\" (1955) with Clark Gable, Jane Russell, and Robert Ryan. More than any other Hawks' movie, \"Red River\" qualifies as the director's purest expression of physical action on a grand scale with more than 9000 steers filling the frame. This epic western dealt not only with Manifest Destiny as one of its multiple themes but also the creation of the great western cattle empires that would mass produce beef for national consumption. At the same time, Hawks' film depicts the trials and tribulations that occurred after the Civil War in Texas. An autocratic cattle baron struggles to maintain his authority against well-nigh impossible odds. Treacherous white desperadoes plundered herds and cattlemen confronted these brigands as well as bloodthirsty Native Americans. Nothing like \"Red River\" had been attempted, even by legendary western director, John Ford, who had chronicled the development of the railroad in his silent classic \"The Iron Horse.\" Indeed, James Cruze's \"The Covered Wagon\" (1923) and later Walsh's \"The Big Trail\" (1930) showed the physical hardships that the pioneers encountered on wagon trains crossing the vast untamed west. On the other hand, nobody had made a movie about herding cattle. This monumental cattle drive served as the larger-than-life background story to the foreground story about a penniless ranch baron, Tom Dunson, (John Wayne) and his adopted son, Matthew Garth (Montgomery Cliff), who built one of the biggest cattle ranches in Texas. Eventually, Raoul Walsh made \"The Tall Men\" (1955), with Clark Gable, Jane Russell, and Robert Ryan, the second greatest western about cattle driving.\"Red River\" opens in 1851 with a wagon train crossing the plains when ex-soldier Tom Dunson (John Wayne) and his friend Nadine Groot (Walter Brennan) leave the safety of the procession and venture off south. The wagon train boss warns Dunson about hostile Indians in the vicinity. Ironically, the Indians massacre the train and Dunson's amour (Coleen Gray) who he refused to take with him because he couldn't ensure her safety. Dunson and Groot survive an Indian attack. As they are about to resume their journey, a teenager leading a cow, who survived the Indian attack, wanders into their camp. The orphaned Matthew Garth (Montgomery Cliff) grows up to become Dunson's adopted son. Fifteen years later, Dunson presides over 9-thousand cattle, but he is as broke as Texas. Dunson decides to drive the herd to market in Missouri. Dunson quarrels with Matt over the best route, and Matt rebels against Dunson's overbearing rules. At gunpoint, Garth relieves Dunson of the herd and drives it to Kansas instead of Missouri. Along the way, our heroes help out a wagon train besieged by Indians. Matt meets Tess Millay (Joanne Dru) who falls in love with him. A vengeful Dunson, who has vowed to kill him, trails Matt until they confront each other in Abilene and challenges him to duel. During this showdown, Matt refuses to shoot Dunson. Dunson and Garth beat each other to a pulp until Tess intervenes and forces them to shake hands. \"Red River\" proved something of a departure for John Wayne. Wayne had confined himself to roles roughly corresponding to his actual age. In \"Red River,\" however, Tom Dunson ages some 14 years, a feat that the actor had never been called on to portray. Wayne goes from being a fit, fast-drawing, dark-haired hero to a tyrannical, gray-haired individual who cannot draw his six-gun as swiftly and suffers from the infirmity of his increased longevity. John Ford, who gave Wayne his first important role in \"Stagecoach,\" saw \"Red River\" and told Hawks that Wayne's portrayal of an older man captivated him. Subsequently, Ford cast Wayne as a retiring cavalry commander in his own classic western \"She Wore A Yellow Ribbon.\" Actually, \"Red River\" is a seminal Wayne feature because in many of his later oaters, particularly \"The Train Robbers,\" his colleagues always refer to him as stubborn, bull-headed, and Tom Dunson established that character for Wayne. Hawks said that he considered making \"Red River\" in color but elected to use black & white to give the film a period look. Montgomery Cliff surprised Howard Hawks when he managed to hold his own against his renowned co-star. Next to \"From Here to Eternity,\" \"Red River\" is one of Clift's best performances and he looks comfortable in his cowboy outfit. The scene between Clift and Ireland where they swap six-guns and keep a tin can flying through the air is outstanding. Of course, Walter Brennan steals the movie with the running gag about his teeth. Early in the action, he loses his teeth to a Cherokee Indian when he is playing for table stakes in a poker game and cannot borrow money. Consequently, he stakes his teeth, but loses the game. The Cherokee lets the Brennan character eat with them, but he demands that he return them between meals. The Brennan character complains because his teeth helped keep the dust out of his mouth. Noah Beery, Jr., is very good as Buster and the man who taught John Wayne his distinctive walk\u0097Paul Fix of \"The Rifleman\" TV show\u0097is perfect as one of the drovers who rebels against Dunson.A lawsuit between Howard Hughes and Hawks arose over a simple line of dialogue from an earlier movie, \"The Outlaw,\" that Hawks had worked on with Hawks postponed the release of \"Red River\" from 1946 to 1948.",

            "content": "So I'm watching \"The Last Picture Show\" a couple of weeks ago, and as it turns out, the final film at The Royal turns out to be \"Red River\". That great 'Take 'em to Missouri' scene was just enough to have me call up the title through my local library system, and here it is not much later and I've got another John Wayne flick under my belt.Anyway, setting aside Wayne's first fifty or so films prior to \"Stagecoach\", and all those later movies where he plays himself time after time, there were a number of quality pictures where The Duke actually looked pretty good as an actor. \"The Searchers\" was one, and quite coincidentally, his character here is very much like Ethan Edwards. Thomas Dunson is an overbearing hothead, bent on his own personal mission and goals, and won't let anyone or anything stand in his way. He's a tad more tolerable as a person in \"Red River\" however; somehow I couldn't reconcile my feelings for Wayne's character in \"The Searchers\", where he intends to kill his niece for the misfortune of having been kidnapped by Comanches. That didn't make a whole lot of sense to me, even if she was 'contaminated' by heathens.As for \"Red River\", I have to come down on the side of a lot of reviewers who have some trouble with Dunson's erratic turnabout to reconcile with surrogate son Matt Garth (Montgomery Clift) in the finale. Yeah, that was a pretty powerful speech by Tess Millay (Joanne Dru), but Dunson was hell bent for leather as he headed for Matt, and even a bullet from Cherry Valance (John Ireland) didn't stop him. It was a pretty good fight though, so maybe taking a few shots from Matt was enough to knock some sense into him. Still, a one hundred eighty degree turn like that doesn't happen in real life too often.As always, Walter Brennan turns in a nice performance as Wayne's sidekick, Groot Nadine. Besides the occasional comic relief, Groot tries to serve as Dunson's conscience every now and then to steer him on to a straighter path. It usually didn't work. If anything, Brennan is even more effective in a later team-up with Wayne, that of jailer Stumpy in another Howard Hawks picture, 1959's \"Rio Bravo\". In that one, Rick Nelson plays a character that was originally offered to Montgomery Clift. Funny how things work out sometimes.Best line of the picture had to be that of Cherry Valance, speaking to Matt Garth when they first meet - \"...only two things more beautiful than a good gun, a Swiss watch or a woman from anywhere.\" You know, that name had me wondering if Cherry Valance might have been any relation to Liberty Valance.",

Along the way, things get exceedingly difficult, making Wayne into a fearsome tyrant who thinks little of shooting his men dead if they cross him. As thinks get tougher, a mutiny arises...I loved nearly everything about this film. Hawks' direction is perfection. Wayne and Clift have rarely been better. The cinematography and musical score are exquisite. The script is great. I only have one problem: the romance...SPOILERSI assume they did it to pack the women into the theaters. This is definitely a guy's movie. Wayne begins the film with a girlfriend. She is brutally massacred by some Indians. This backstory is set up far too quickly and it never seems to have any bearing on what transpires later. Clift meets up with a soon-to-be prostitute being brought to Nevada. Through a set of very unlikely and silly circumstances, they fall in love. Later on, Wayne, who, as you know if you've seen the film, is planning to kill Clift and he finds this girl and takes her with him. Joanne Dru plays this woman, Tess, and very badly, I might mention. This character seems to butt her way into the picture, and she's entirely annoying. The film's end is pretty disappointing, 90% because of her. When she butts in and breaks up the fight between Wayne and Clift - a fight, I should mention, that we've been anticipating since the first minutes of the film - it's like someone stepping on your toes. Without these two romances, Red River may have just been the best Western ever made. As it stands, it's just one of the best.",

Their journey is fraught with personality clashes, a nighttime stampede, an attempted lynching, and an Indian attack. Beautifully-made and acted treatise on the frontier experience, with stone-faced, cold-hearted Wayne giving one of his finest performances, Brennan easing the tension with scratchy comedic relief, Clift eerily assured and focused. The female performers don't come off quite as well, and Dimitri Tiomkin's music often sounds like a Hallelujah Chorus of Cowpokes, yet Hawks allows the vividly-created atmosphere to seep in steadily. The dusty and grizzled faces of the men, the pounding of the herd, the silhouettes of the stagecoaches on the hill: all intense and unforgettable.

            "content": "Red River (1948) **** (out of 4) Landmark Western has John Wayne playing Thomas Dunson, a Texas rancher who spends fourteen years building the greatest cattle ranch in Texas but after the war cattle prices are so low he finds himself broke. In order to try and get money back he decides on a cattle drive to Missouri where along the way he's going to battle Indians, his own men, bad weather and eventually his own adopted son (Montgomery Clift). This iconic Western has apparently become so well-known that when people think of a cattle drive they don't think of real history but instead just think of the events in this film. This film has pretty much become history for many people and while the film, at times, goes on way too long I think there's enough here to where you can easily call it a classic. The story itself is pretty much just Mutiny on the Bounty out West but this certainly isn't a bad thing as we get to see Wayne in one of his greatest performances. There's no question Wayne was the ultimate good guy but whenever a script gave him the chance of being bad then he certainly ate it up and this is one of the greatest examples. The coldness that Wayne delivers is pitch-perfect and the way he slowly begins to lose his mind is handled wonderfully well by the actor. Clift, on the other hand, is completely different as his method style clearly was bringing in a new style. The one thing that rarely gets mentioned when RED RIVER is discussed is the two different styles of acting. With the likes of Wayne, Walter Brennan, Harry Carey and Noah Beery, Jr. you had that old school but mixing it with the newer style of Clift and John Ireland you've got a pretty interesting texture that really mixes well together and the results are clearly on screen. Watching how Wayne and Clift play off one another really gives us some fireworks and helps keep the film moving. The scenery is another major plus as you really get the feeling that you're in the old West and along on this trail. There are many classic scenes here and too many highlights to name them all but the opening sequence with Wayne taking off only to be attacked by the Indians is priceless as is another sequence where the cows start a stampede. I think the film does start to get watered down and feel as if it's going on too long but most of this is due to the romance, which is added towards the end of the movie. I didn't think this here worked at all and I think the ending really lets everything down that came before it. With that said, RED RIVER is still one of the most famous films ever made and it clearly lives up to its reputation.",

            "content": "There's something about this film that feels like a step up. It's weird because Hawks had been an assured directorial hand for almost two decades by the time he made this, with several great films to his name, but this production is so much bigger, complex, and intricate. Visually, it embraces the mythic feeling of a John Ford Western. This adaptation of Borden Chase's serialized novel The Chisholm Trail feels like Howard Hawks really reaching to make something bigger and newer for himself, and he succeeds wildly.John Wayne plays Thomas Dunson, a rancher who struck off from a wagon train north of Texas and claimed a large patch of land just this side of the Rio Grande. Through grit and hard work, after 14 years and surviving through the economic hardship of the Civil War, he's in a desperate situation. His thousands of heads of cattle are worth little where he is, but if he could get them to Missouri, he'll find a market. He's broke except for his cattle, and he has to do this.Along for the ride are his collection of hired hands including his long-term compatriot and friend, Walter Brennan's Nadine Groot, and adopted son Montgomery Clift's Matthew Garth. Dunson picked up Matthew shortly after her left the wagon train, it was attacked by a Comanche war party, and Matthew was able to escape after chasing after his horse. With the Civil War, Matthew had gone to support Texas, but returned, he's back to offer Dunson the support he needs to accomplish this great deed.Hawks had often made movies about hard men in hard professions, but I think Dunson is the first protagonist who could be called a visionary. He has to move a mountain, essentially, and no one else can really see what he's trying to do. What he starts his team out with are promises of riches, payment of over a hundred dollars each at the end of their weeks' long hard journey. It'll be perilous with known and unknown dangers including access to water and even potential bandits along the way, but it's either braving that or starving with their thousands of cattle.The heart of the film is the long journey northwards. Chase said that his story was based rather heavily on the mutiny on the HMS Bounty with Dunson acting as the Texas William Bligh, and it shows. Dunson is a driven man, out to make the impossible happen since no one has managed to successfully travel the trail all the way up to Missouri yet. He has no choice but to make it happen. There's no turning back. There's no delaying. There's no room for error. There's no deviation. It has to be Missouri because he knows the railroad is there for certain, and with the railroad is his ticket to the market to sell his life's work for a fair price. In order to work his will, though, he has to operate through his men.Groot and Garth are his right-hand men, standing by him through every setback and punishment, whether they agree with him or not, but it gets harder for them the longer the journey goes on. When Bunk causes a stampede by sneaking sugar in the night, causing some pans to fall and startle the antsy cows, one man is killed in the work to wrangle the herd once again. As punishment the next morning, Dunson decides to whip Bunk in front of the men. When word circulates amongst the men that there's a train station in Abeline, Kansas, allowing them an opportunity to bypass the dangerous ground up to Missouri, Dunson won't hear of it. All they have is rumors of a railroad, not actual proof. He has to go where he knows there's a railroad, even if it is more dangerous.Things come to a head when Dunson threatens to hang two men who had run off in the night and got brought back. It's too cruel for Matthew to take, so he draws his gun, takes Dunson's, and takes control of the herd, directing them westward to Abeline and the promise of a railroad.What the movie ultimately is about is the passing of one generation into another. Dunson is the man who built the ranch and got the herd moving, but it has to be the son who finishes it. The ownership of the future passes from one generation to the other. Matthew has to form a new path from Dunson to keep everything moving, and even if Dunson doesn't like it, that's the direction that's going to happen.Now, I don't throw the word perfect around a whole lot, but I think Red River would have been perfect save for a couple of small things. The first is the least important of the two, but there's an early introduction of John Ireland's Cherry Valance, a gunslinger who signs up with Dunson and develops a certain kind of rivalry with Matthew. He largely vanishes by the halfway point because of, apparently, some behind the scenes rivalry with Hawks over the affections of Joanne Dru whom Ireland eventually married. The other thing is more important, and it's the ending. In the original book Matthew fatally wounds Dunson when Dunson catches up with him at Abeline, managing to take him back for one final look at Texas before he dies. In the movie, they get into a scuffle and it gets broken up by the lately introduced Tess (Dru), devolving into a chuckle as Dunson tells Matthew to marry her. It's...a lesser ending.One of the most wonderful things about Hawks in general and Red River specifically is Hawks films tend to have this tendency of recalling earlier moments in the film late without much fanfare. At the start of the film Dunson told his love to stay with the wagon train until he sent for her, after he had successfully established his ranch. She died, of course. Late, we get introduced to Dru's Tess as a love interest for Matthew, and the echoes of Dunson's girl are evident. There are small repetitions of dialogue that don't get huge underlines for the viewer not paying attention, but they're there. What this ends up doing is really playing with the idea of Matthew being able to lead a new life built on both the successes and failings Dunson had to build the ranch up to a point, standing on Dunson's shoulders to find new successes as his example. All of this is in the film whether Matthew kills Dunson or not, which I why despite my somewhat lackluster feeling towards the film's final moments still feel that the film overall is not only a great one but one of Hawks' best.",

Both are \"river movies\", although the river in \"Red River\" is not the river of the title but rather the \"River of Red\", (the working title) represented by the longhorn \"beeves\" the heroes are taking to market. There is something inherently cinematic about movies that involve a journey down a river. They always seem metaphors for the journey of life.Both films have significant introductory stories. Red River doesn't begin with the trail drive. It begins with the story of Tom Dunson, his first love, lost in a wagon train raid and his creation of one of the largest ranches in Texas. He also meets up with Matthew Garth, who will become his surrogate son. This is important because it reveals much about his character. In the Big Sky, we first meet Jim Deakins in Kentucky, where he meets his new friend, Boone Caudill, (these characters were originally to have been played by Wayne and Clift in a re-pairing from their Red River success). Then we get a humorous look at St. Louis in the 1830's before the story really begins with the expedition down the Missouri.Both films have complex male characters. Dunston is a driven man but a sensitive one, who was madly in love with the woman he lost and sees something of her in Joanne Dru's character, an important element because it softens him a bit for the confrontation at the end. Garth is a cocky young guy but one with internal strength. Will it be enough? Jim Deakins is a tough but very agreeable character, a contrast to the sort of hard driven guy Kirk Douglas was known for playing, (and being). Dewey Martin's Caudill is defined by his hatred of Indians. He's humanized by Deakin's friendship and his love for Teal Eye.Both films examine the subject of male \"love\", not in the \"Brokeback Mountain\" sense but in the sense that Michael Landon talked about when he was interviewed about \"Bonanza\": \"When you get right down to it the strongest attachments are between men--fathers, brothers.\" And the strongest fights are between the people who are most attached.Both films feature strong women, too. Colleen Gray in her one scene in Red River proves herself to be not just a sweet young thing but the kind of strong woman a Tom Dunson would want standing next to him- not behind him- through life. And Joanne Dru echoes her in one of the best female roles in the western genre- a woman strong enough to love two men and bring them together. And Teal Eye is a resourceful gal who knows what she wants and overcomes Boone's irrational hatred of her kind to bring out the love in him. These ladies are what the term \"a good woman\" was meant to describe.As to the ending of Red River, did you really want to see Tom or Matt die? Did you want to see one responsible for the death of the other? My only complaint with this is that the conversion should have taken longer than it did, perhaps after a \"Spoilers\" type fight and a night of nursing wounds. But these guys- and these gals- belong together in the journey down the river of life.",

            "content": "Released in 1948 and directed by Howard Hawks (with Arthur Rosson), \"Red River\" stars John Wayne as a tough ranch mogul who heads a cattle drive from Texas to Missouri, the culmination of over 14 years of work. But his authoritarian abuse along the way causes his men to revolt, led by his adopted son (Montgomery Clift). Walter Brennan in on hand as the rancher's sidekick while John Ireland plays the son's friend/rival. The plot is essentially Mutiny on the Bounty in the Old West on a cattle drive. For that reason alone the story's compelling, yet it isn't anywhere near as good as Brando's or Gibson's versions of the infamous mutiny ('62 and '84 respectively). Nevertheless, it's great seeing Wayne when he was lean & mean at 40; and the tensions that slowly build leading to the gripping confrontation are well done. Moreover, Clift and Ireland are interesting, the former a precursor to the pensive style of Marlon Brando and James Dean. Speaking of Clift and Ireland, people confused about their sexuality tend to be obsessed with reading a \"homosexual subtext\" into their relationship, but it doesn't exist. Yes, the characters talk about each other's guns, but that's because they're young gunslingers. It's purely shop talk. Cherry (Ireland) is clearly interested in some past babe he met in a town and Matt becomes romantically enamored by Tess (Joanne Dru). Only pathetic SJWs who believe the drivel of their doofus libertine professors would read a \"gay subtext\" into the movie. The fact that Clift later fell into homosexuality and the corresponding guilt is irrelevant. While the movie's certainly worthwhile, it's held back by the B&W photography, dated score and a couple other old-fashioned elements. The dramatic scene between Clift and Dru during the Native attack on the wagon trail is eye-rolling and unbelievable. Moreover, the Arizona locations are disingenuous seeing as how Arizona looks nothing like the geography of the actual Chisholm Trail in Central/East Texas and the plains of Central Oklahoma & Kansas. The film runs 133 minutes and was shot in Arizona with studio work done in West Hollywood. The screenplay was written by Borden Chase & Charles Schnee based on Chase' story.

            "content": "Westerns have always been taken too lightly, whether as pure entertainment with no substance, or hard-hitting violence that does nothing for sophisticated audiences. However, with John Ford and Howard Hawks making these kind of pictures, it is no wonder that the Western genre is still a much-loved style. Perhaps Ford was the better of the two directors in relaying the Western themes to the screen, but Hawks was the better storyteller and he shows his steady hand all throughout Red River, more than just about a cattle drive from Texas to Missouri, but also about the relationship between a man and his adopted son and what it would mean to each of them to see this accomplished.Who would have thought that the young, handsome actor supporting and perhaps upending the great Western actor John Wayne would become that which he did? Montgomery Clift, in his screen debut, shines as the loyal but firm-headed Matt Garth, determined to see this mission through. Wayne is great as usual in this role that is somewhat of a prequel to his Ethan Edwards in Ford's The Searchers.However, this is not really about a Western story. It is the American dream, shown in such a blissful and beautiful way that you cannot help but admire it. The widescreen photography suits the scenery just fine, complementing the beauty of the landscape despite the lack of color. The supporting cast provides most of that, especially Hawks favorite Walter Brennan as the cook Groot, always ready with a sly or smart remark.Considered today one of the great American westerns, it is certainly one of Hawks' finest achievements; capturing an era long-gone but never too far that we cannot visit again and learn that times were tough back then but the ambition and determination that drove men to do what they did is still alive in us as Americans today.",

            "content": "You don't have to use up too much of your imagination to get into and to appreciate this Epic, Howard Hawks does a manificent job in bringing to us a story that depicts the strengths ( and weaknesses ) of early pioneers in the American West. In Red River, Hawks clearly makes us aware of the hardships and loneliness settlers experienced doing their thing, particularly on cattle drives. John Wayne, as always in his element astride a horse, does a great job portraying the single minded cattle Baron Tom Dunson. He looked comfortable in the role with all his regulars like Harry Carey Snr. and Jnr,.Hank Worden and Walter Brennan around him and, along with Hawks is responsible for the Movie being as good as it is. You could almost taste the dust and sweat as Dunson bullies his way along the cattle drive, ignoring advice, doing what a man has to do and saying often, ' I'll read over them in the mornin ', then, being left in the dust himself after his men and his adopted son Matthew Garth...... played by Mongomery Clift.... decide they've had enough. We always knew they'd meet up with each other again, and when they did....what a showdown! Dunson catches up with them in Abeline, gets off his horse when he sees Garth and bullies his way again, this time through a herd of cattle to get to him. That walk Wayne makes amongst the cows is a classic. For a big guy he's got a lot of balance, never losing his stride as he forces his way through the herd, turns, draws and fires at Cherry Valance....played by another resident bad guy of the era, John Ireland....gets hit with a bullet from Valance, crosses the railway track then proceeds to beat up on the only man game enough to stand up to him, and in the process gets a bit of a pasting himself. Fantastic stuff!! Both Clift and Brennan, who played Dunson's old friend Groot Nadine give fine supporting roles, particularly Brennan with his excellent narrative throughout the Movie. Made in 1948, Red River is a great Western and perhaps had much to do in setting standards for others to follow.",

Montgomery Clift has one of his best roles ever as Wayne's adopted son, who rebels against him and takes the herd in an opposite, less dangerous direction, becoming the first drive ever to complete the Old Chisholm Trail.Red River is first-rate all the way and one of, if not the best real cowboy picture ever made, thanks to great performances, photography, and interesting psychological elements in the script, regarding Wayne's breakdown and the cowboy's almost superstitious fear after they abandon Wayne in the wilderness. Also, the ending is incredibly satisfying.The supporting cast plays like a who's who of the Duke's greatest co-stars, with Walter Brennan, Noah Beery Jr., Paul Fix, Hank Worden, Harry Carrey, and Harry Carrey Jr. They're all a joy to watch.In the famous (or infamous) scene where John Ireland and Clift admire each other's guns, Ireland states, \" There are only two things more beautiful than a good gun, a Swiss watch or a woman from anywhere.\"The line must have had quite an effect, as forty-four years later he took it for his own, repeating it on a movie set in a casual conversation with co-star M.

It's an interesting story full of action and tension, told with great skill and expert pacing by Howard Hawks, and with a supporting cast that complements Wayne very well.Having a character that is not wholly heroic or sympathetic gives Wayne a great chance to show what he can do in a more complex role, and his portrayal of Tom Dunson is memorable and convincing.  And it really helps that the other lead, Montgomery Clift, is perfectly cast in a role that brings out his best, and that also provides a nice balance to Wayne's character.  The story of the long cattle drive provides plenty of action, and also makes for good character study.  The rest of the cast helps out, too, with several good performances.This is one of a handful of Westerns that go at or near the top of almost anyone's list - make sure to see it if you have the chance.",

To say nothing of the deployment of the night stampede rumpus, plainly wielding such a massive quantity of cattle is indisputably taxing for the crew meanwhile an awe-inspiring spectacle for its audiences in the primitive black and white. All along this laborious trek, there are presumable threats looming large (native Indians or borderline gangsters), but what's fatal to the solidarity is the disruption from within, Thomas is a hard-bitten fogey, his tyrannical domination of the bunch is short-sighted, but in propria persona, he is not a loathsome character (at least not as he assumes to be), he has a wound in his heart, a responsibility to shield his properties, and a paternal attachment to Matthew, so he takes the mutiny too seriously and there is a death wish in his heart to sacrifice and sublimate himself to a higher cause of love, very stupid and rather egotistic in hindsight, but probably is the fashion for the sake of manhood during the time within a tunnel vision. However, rather interestingly Matthew represents exactly another fashion of manhood, a percipient, tender-hearted gunslinger with a slender figure and an appealing face, exuding an irresistible sex appeal which panders to meet more modern eyes. Thus the conflict can also be reckoned as a combat between these two sorts of aesthetics, yet, in my humble opinion, the biggest letdown is the hasty ending, in the brink of an eye, a gratuitous buffer (a babbling Dru) abruptly jumps into the foreground and lambastes them in a most comic way which is not align with the wholesome tone whatsoever, then everything has been miraculously resolved, what an inadequate happy ending and an overkill to all the tension amassed for almost 2 hours. Anyway, it is a solid western picture and Wayne even proves to be a qualified thespian against a ravishing Clift, Brennan is the comic relief and Dru is literally redundant with a ridiculous and belly-laughing reaction after being shot in the shoulder by an arrow. But the most LOL reference is a tacit pun comes alive with Ireland's banter with Clift - \"There is a good-looking gun you were about to use back there, can I see it? Maybe you'd like to see mine!\", hell yeah, no one can resist that!",

            "content": "Howard Hawks hit a home run right out of the box with his first real western film, starring John Wayne and a young Montgomery Clift as rival owners of a ranch in Texas who are forced to undergo a 1000 mile long cattle drive in order to sell their cattle and save the ranch. They take along with them a ragtag bunch of cowboys including gunman John Ireland and cantankerous chef Walter Brennan. Along the way, the deadliest conflict turns out to be between Dunson (Wayne) and Matt Garth (Clift) and not the various \"indians\" and cattle rustling gangs that terrify them to begin with.Wayne gives one of his better performances in old age makeup, but Clift steals as much of the movie as possible with his warm smile and his eyes that seem to imply ambiguity even when there is none in the script. The women in the picture could have been better; I thought Coleen Gray should have played the meatier part and Joanne Dru would have been better for the smaller one. Sometimes it seems like the cattle are the real star of the movie; unlike a lot of westerns where they try to make 100 cows look like a herd, this movie really has a huge bunch of cattle going across rivers and plains and providing impressive scenery.The only real problem with the film is that it's somewhat predictable. For example there's the character who is killed in the stampede, who makes a big sentimental speech right before he dies. You want to shout out, \"hey, stop talking, you're gonna end up dead.\" Ireland's character is fascinating and could have been developed a bit more (Hawks claims that Ireland was smoking weed and drinking and he had to cut the dialog). But the central drama between Wayne and Clift is handled very well and makes for a somewhat harrowing experience. The dialog is always smart and as usual with a Hawks film it's all handled with finesse and style.",

Directed by Howard Hawks, it contains many of the types of characters that would appear in his subsequent westerns (i.e. \"Rio Bravo\"). There's the tough no nonsense authority figure, the toothless sidekick, the young gunfighter, the sharp tongued female etc.John Wayne playing against type for the first time, is Tom Dunson who with his sidekick Groot (Walter Brennan) and youngster Matt Garth (Mickey Kuhn) leave a wagon train and settle on land in Texas to build the biggest cattle ranch in the area despite the mild protest from the supposed Mexican owner. Dunson when leaving the wagon train had left the love of his life Fen (Coleen Gray) behind to be killed by Indians.Anyway, Matt grows up to be Montgomery Clift (in his first film) who has been away (we are not told where) and has become a notorious gunfighter. Following the Civil War, Dunson finds that there is no market for his cattle so he decides to embark on a cattle drive to Sedelia, Missouri. Dunson becomes increasingly neurotic as the drive proceeds.About half way through, Matt learns of an alternate route over the newly formed Chisholm Trail to the railroad at Abelene, Kansas. Dunson insists on taking the drive to Missouri. The drovers are becoming disenchanted with Dunson's relentless drive. When he threatens to hang two deserters, Matt takes over the herd and \"maroons\" Dunson. Dunson vows to follow and ultimately kill Matt. The rest of the film awaits their ultimate showdown.Hawks, who also produced, assembled a cast of veteran recognizable western performers. Joanne Dru plays \"saloon girl\" Tess Milay, John Ireland gunfighter Cherry Valance, Harry Carey Sr. cattle buyer Melville, Harry Carey Jr. drover Dan Latimer and Noah Beery Jr. drover Buster.Also along for the drive are veterans Chief Yowlachie, Paul Fix, Hank Worden, Hal Taliaferro, Tom Tyler, Glenn Strange, Lane Chandler, Pierce Lyden and John Merton. Watch for Shelley Winters as another \"saloon Girl\" in the campfire sequence.In spite of an impending duel between Matt and Cherry it never comes to pass and they become friends. And the final showdown between Dunson and Matt leaves much to be desired. The size difference between the two makes a physical confrontation a little one sided don't you think.There are two versions of the film. The first, the pre-release version runs 133 minutes and has a journal relating the story over the course of the picture. The theatrical version at 127 minutes has a voice over narration by Walter Brennan and was the preferred version of Hawks.",

The ageing cattle baron has been assisted throughout the years by his adopted son, Matt Garth (Montgomery Clift, in a great contrast with Wayne), whose parents were killed in Indian attacks. Indeed, the tough-shelled Dunson has been carrying a personal wound for years, after his sweetheart was also killed by Indians. The pair are preparing to drive their cattle to market from Texas to the Missouri railhead.But, in shades of 'Mutiny On The Bounty', Dunson goes tyrannical in his quest to maintain control of his enterprise whilst on the drive, and Matt takes the herd away from Dunson to Kansas, on better advice. Dunson loves Matt, but swears to kill him. A fascinating psychological game ensues, with old hand Wayne pursuing young, determined Clift across the states.Excellent acting from both male leads. Wayne is really excellent in this one, portraying a man older than him in years. Clift, the Method Actor, matches him well throughout, and it is wonderful to watch the interactions between these two. The great Walter Brennan lends a hand as the toothless Groot, Dunson's lifelong friend. John Ireland also pops up as a rival gunslinger to Clift, Cherry Valance. The homo-erotic subtext is a much talked about point in this film, with Clift and Ireland's first encounter where they 'shoot it out' being filled with all sorts of innuendo and symbols.Perhaps the only downer in the casting is the females. In Westerns, the gals were always characterised a bit sketchy, and Joanne Dru as Matt's love interest Tess is slightly annoying at times, overacting and all. Still, it's not enough to ruin the film, and she does have a feisty presence (I do love the part where she barely flinches after getting an arrow in the shoulder).Wonderful cinematography, and a grand score. Hawks is such an underrated director; just look at those beautiful, fluid shots of the cattle wandering along the countryside and the supreme close-ups of Wayne, whose facial expressions tell more than any speech or dialogue. This is an epic to behold, and to watch over and over again. It is the most moving of Westerns, more than just your standard 'shoot-em-up'. Wayne and Clift imbue their characters with real emotions, and the final confrontation between the two is both breath-taking and nail-biting.10/10.",

Some of that is the strong screenplay that deftly combines an empire plot with a battle of wills while making the most of dark comedic overtones present in the western. This film undermines its own myths in the way that great westerns do.Hawk is classical in his direction and stages scenes in a technically impressive way.

            "content": "I understand the reason why a lot of people are disappointed over the ending of Red River. The movie, up until the ending, does a wonderful job of drawing us in to the story of the hard-nosed tyrannical cattle owner Thomas Dunson (John Wayne) and his adopted son Matt Garth (Montgomery Clift). Dunson and Garth along with Dunson's lifetime side kick and cook, Nadine Groot (Walter Brennan) have set out along with many other hired men, to relocate as much of Dunson's cattle as they can. Against terrible odds of survival the hired men set out with dreams of making $100 a person for their efforts. Along the way many of the men talk of an easier and quicker passage for relocation through Abilene, but Dunson will not hear of it unless he has absolute proof that a railroad runs through this spot. This becomes the seedling of mutiny. After many days of adversity the hired men become more restless. We slowly see that his men are giving up on Dunson's methods of leadership by intimidation and have become increasingly tired of Dunson and his stubborn plight of relocating his cattle across the states while battling through hostile territories. We also see that Dunson is starting to break under the strain of herding two drives, one of his cattle and the other of his cattle herders. Dunson resorts to shooting and killing some of the men that tried to quit the drive. Dunson is not only becoming ornery with his hired help, but with Garth and Root as well. Dunson snaps at Groot and doesn't listen to Garth's thoughts of a different passage. Dunson won't sleep at night for fear of other men quitting on the job. The hired men begin to think that they can either do battle against the ever waiting Indians or other cowboys trying to steal Dunson's cattle, or they can run away from Dunson. One-night three hired men take a chance and try for their escape once Dunson finally collapses into sleep from exhaustion. These escapees figure they don't want to end up like the others who wanted to quit and were killed, buried and read their last rites by Dunson. In this way Dunson is a precursor to Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) in Pulp Fiction. Except when Dunson is sermonizing, he's already killed you.Once the surviving escapees are caught and brought back to Dunson, Dunson only needs a second to figure on how he will kill them. When he mentions that he intends to hang the deserters, the rest of the men, including Garth rebel against Dunson. The quick draw of his son helps to spare the life of the deserters, but also severs the father and son relationship to the point that a broken down and dejected Dunson tells Garth, \"I'm going to find you Matt, I'm going to find you and then I'm going to kill ya\". This moment was very powerful. And it is perhaps the best moment in the film. This event refocuses Dunson and it makes him blind to anything else in the world. The rest of the movie starts back up with a new dynamic. I started to care more about what would happen to Garth and Dunson than I did at all about the destination of the cattle drive. You know the ending is going to be severe and that someone is going to have to die. Well, you would think so.And this is where the debate starts up. Some people really like the feel good ending. For me, the ending comes across as what I would expect a movie made in 1998 to end like, not 1948. That damn speech by that woman (I won't mention her name), who came into the story more than two thirds the way through, that just tidies everything up, I just can't see it. All in all, I can't hold that against the movie. It was so excellent up to that point. I can accept the ending; I just don't like it. And furthermore, Howard Hawks didn't like the ending either.What I did like was: The scene of the cattle before the drive, the one that does a 360-degree pan. For its time it was very impressive. Walter Brennan. Then again, I like almost anything with Walter Brennan in it. The on going joke about losing his teeth in a poker game is fantastic. However, I didn't get to see the version that Brennan narrates; I saw the one that plays out through a diary. Apparently the Brennan narrative is the better version. Or so Howard Hawks seemed to think.Montgomery Clift was a revelation. It's too bad he died so early in his life.Despite the happy ending, it still ranks 10/10.Clark Richards",

The Captain Bligh to Montomery Clift character's Matthew Garth's Fletcher Christian, the two play out their \"gods at war\" scenario against the backdrop of an epic cattle-drive from Texas to Missouri (ending up in Abilene instead).The story's episodic feel is emphasised by drop-in narrative cards throughout and you know that the big resolving confrontation between Wayne & Clift will occur in the final reel. Before that though there's plenty of (true) grit played out on the trail, as loyalties amongst the men are stretched to breaking point by Wayne's Dunson character's monomaniac bloody-mindedness to get the job done his way and his way only.Besides Wayne at the head of the cast, Montgomery Clift in his debut role is excellent, managing to look boyish but still convince you of his steeliness at the same time. Walter Brennan is likewise unforgettable as the loyal-up-to-a-point jester to Dunstan's Lear.The only weak points for me are that more wasn't made of John Ireland's gunslinger Cherry Vallance character's bristling enmity and jealousy against Matt (you can visibly see his part being scaled down as the movie progresses) and later the emergence of Joanne Dru's Meg Tillay character close to the end to broker the peace between Wayne & Clift at the conclusion seems too pat and somewhat incongruous to what has gone before (even as it reminds us of the demise of Wayne's lady-love early on in the piece). I might add that it rarely looks as if the herd of cattle numbers much more than a few hundred never mind the alleged 10000 but that said the famous stampede scene is thrillingly rendered even so.These caveats aside this is an all-time great Western, brilliantly directed by Howard Hawks, so good in fact that I actually prefer his style to the slightly corny, over-sentimental films in the same genre by the still-great John Ford. This river will run and run so long as great movies are made and revered...",

            "content": "This film has one of the greater casts ever assembled for a western. John Wayne is the big star. It is only the third major film for Montgomery Clift. Harey Carey, Walter Brennan & a host of great western support help. It is nearly a classic.I say nearly because the ending is a bit flawed. For some reason the studio in trying to build Clifts image kind of made the ending into a draw between Clift & Wayne's characters. Even though Howard Hawks did a lot of excellent work on this film, the ending seems to be a bit of a reach & there is no real compelling reason for it.Clift would go on within three years & do the classic performance in \"A Place In the Sun\" that to me is his best. He is good here, but other than trying to build him up, I can't see why else an otherwise strong film would end this way.With a stronger ending, this film would have been another earlier black & white film as strong as The Searchers for Wayne. At least with Waynes career, good things did come to those who wait. Wayne worked a lot in the 1930's only to finally get fame with Stagecoach. During the war, he worked hard to really solidify his star status.This film after the war was his starring picture of the late 40's, but it would take the 1950's to finally stop scripts sharing him with someone else as this film does, as the flawed hero. Thanks to Wayne working so hard in the Western Genre, he has great Western performances in 5 decades, the 30's, 40's, 50's, 60's & 70's. It is a body of western film work not equaled by any other actor. When he finally got an Oscar for True Grit, it was the culmination of all that work. This film is a part of that legacy.",

            "content": "I knew the genre, I knew the popular leading actor, and I knew it was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it was rated highly by critics, so I looked forward to watching it, directed by Howard Hawks (Scarface, Bringing Up Baby, To Have and Have Not, Monkey Business, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes). Basically set during the time of the end of the American Civil War, stubborn man Thomas Dunson (John Wayne) wants to start up a successful cattle ranch in Texas, he manages to do so with the help old cowpoke Nadine Groot (Walter Brennan), and his unofficially adopted young man Matthew 'Matt' Garth (Montgomery Clift). Dunson's dream has not been without its hitches and adversities, including the situation where he met Matt when the wagon train he and Grrot had accompanied for some time from St. Louis was ambushed by Indians, Dunson's love Fen (Coleen Gray) was one of the victims. It has also not been easy to take over the unoccupied land and establish the ranch, north of the Rio Grande in west Texas, the result of the war has left many poor, including Dunson, but many men and ex-soldiers are willing to work as cowboys to rebuild their lives for themselves and their families. Dunson hires a group of men willing to accompany him, Groot and Matt on a potentially lucrative cattle drive to Missouri to sell close to a thousand heads of cattle, including some cattle from neighbouring ranchers, to stockade operating companies at the end of the known railroad line, along the way there will be potential hazards, including ambushing Indians. The journey begins for Dunson and the many hired men, the drive progresses across desert, country and rivers, but with his unyielding ways and single- mindedness to the task Dunson alienates himself from the other men, including Matt, he is generally softer, while Dunson has a \"shoot now, ask questions later\" attitude and mentality. Dunson and Matt do truly love each other as father and son, but they clash heads with their growing adversarial natures, they will have to reconcile if they are both to survive the drive and beyond, especially as they both will not stand down from their beliefs. On the journey members of the team threaten to quit before the end, to which Dunson kills them, the cattle are almost scared away by clumsiness, members are killed in the stampede, and of course the rivalry between Dunson and Matt reaches the point when they part ways, but they reach Missouri, Dunson and Matt reunite and have a furious fight, before being broken up by Matt's love Tess Millay (Joanne Dru), they realise the error of their ways and make peace. Also starring John Ireland as Cherry Valance, Noah Beery Jr. as Buster McGee, Chief Yowlachie as Quo, Harry Carey as Mr. Melville, Harry Carey Jr. as Dan Latimer, Paul Fix as Teeler Yacey, Mickey Kuhn as Matt as a Boy, Misery's Richard Farnsworth as Dunston Rider and Shelley Winters as Dance Hall Girl. Wayne gives a great performance as the uncompromising and unreasonably persistent but noble cattle rancher, Clift is also good as his young fast-on-the-draw ward, the action all plays out like an all boys' adventure, with many tense situations and tough moments along the way, with marvellous music score by Dimitri Tiomkin and sweeping landscape backgrounds, all combined make a masterpiece western. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Motion Picture Story and Best Film Editing. John Wayne was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 13 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men.

            "content": "John Wayne is at his ornery best in this classic western, filmed in 1946 in glorious black & white with plenty of ambiguous gray in terms of storyline and characterization.Wayne, as rancher Tom Dunston, leads a cattle drive out of Texas bound for Missouri, where his beef can fetch a decent price provided he can get his men across hundreds of miles of Indian territory without a wholesale mutiny. Dunston has plenty of trouble on hand, much of it in his head. Years of hanging on to what he's got has made him hard and distrustful of most everything, except the young man he has adopted, Matt Garth (Montgomery Clift), to whom Dunston someday hopes to leave his spread.As an actor, Wayne was one of the greats, though prone to coasting in the hands of a pedestrian script. Fortunately, \"Red River\" is one of the finest ever put to film, and under the guidance of director Howard Hawks, Wayne delivers one of his crunchiest, most shaded performances. He has some classic lines he delivers with real power: \"I'm gonna hang you.\" \"Cherry was right, you were soft. You should have killed me because I'm going to kill you.\" \"Stealing sugar like a little kid. Well, they whip kids to teach them better.\" From those lines, you'd think Wayne plays the bad guy in \"Red River,\" and you'd be sort of right. How many other Wayne films feature a scene where the audience is encouraged to cheer when the Duke takes a punch?The supporting cast is a terrific, colorful, varied cast, led by Clift, in his film debut. Amazingly lean and handsome, he shows why he was the first big new star of the postwar period with a low-key, twitchy performance that invests his second-banana character with quirky nuance. John Ireland plays Cherry, another gunslinger who likes pushing buttons and seems on the verge of doing something dangerous. Cherry challenges conventions of the classic western bad guy in the same way Dunston does of the good guy.The film moves at a sure and steady pace. Like many Hawks films, the action scenes are tableset by quieter ones where men sit around campfires and offer deeper insight as to who they are and what they are about. At its core, \"Red River\" is about the frontier spirit, its rugged code by which Dunston lives and many others die, not mindlessly celebrating it but examining it instead with rigorous, penetrating wit.In an early scene, as Dunston prepares for the drive, he tells his cowhands to brand cattle belonging to other ranchers with the Dunston mark, the Red River D. Garth clearly doesn't agree with this brazen theft, but Dunston almost threatens to brand Garth before backing down after talking it over with one of the other ranchers. Dunston is in essence a good and fair man, but his stringent ways become a burden, and instead of bending he becomes more stern.How would John Ford have handled such a story? Maybe he would have made Dunston's firm nature more admirable, and frowned more on the looser attitudes of Garth and company, who break from their drive to visit a wagon train of gamblers and pretty women. You needed to be tough to survive in the Old West, and \"Red River\" recognizes this, but not without a nuance more in line with modern sensibilities. The cool thing is the film doesn't take sides, just presents them.A lot of reviewers here question the film's tidy resolution, but it's arrived at intelligently. There are problematic points in the film, like the fate of Cherry and the arrival of a love interest played by Joanne Dru, but I see them as grit in the gears that makes for a more interesting, less automatic movie-watching experience. Dru is also one of the most beautiful Western heroines ever on screen, enhanced by a strong characterization in tune with Hawks' appreciation of the female will. That scene where she gets hit by an arrow without breaking her stare of Garth, well, if I'm ever the recipient of like attention from a woman as fine as her, I'll die a happy man.",

            "content": "We all admire the figure in John Wayne movies. He's stern but fair. But in this -- the first movie he made with Howard Hawks -- he goes too far.Determination becomes irrational stubbornness. Some guy who turns a drive for money (what else is it?) into a moral quest. He disregards reason and relies on violence to achieve his ends.What this is, actually, is \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" on the range. John Wayne is really good. He was much better at character parts than he usually gets credit for. He was excellent at curmudgeonly older men in \"She Wore A Yellow Ribbon\" and \"True Grit.\" Montgomery Clift is handsome and not particularly bad, but Western gunslingers and cow punchers are not his forte. Walter Brennan provides the necessary humor. \"I bet I ate enough dust to be incorporated into the Union -- the state of Groot.\" The supporting cast is up to par. John Ireland, as Cherry, made the mistake of romancing and marrying co-star Joanne Dru. Dru was the kind of tough, feisty women who interested director Hawks, but Ireland beat him time and neither Ireland nor Dru worked for Hawks again. Clift's homosexuality didn't seem to bother Hawks, but Hawks may not have known about it. As a Howard Hawks effort, this is pretty typical -- bonds between men. Yet, it's a little unusual in that there is some character development. But the development is imposed on the characters by the script. It's as if they'd been squeezed into a close helmet. They hate each other and at the end kiss and make up. I wonder if Hawks realized quite the subtext. And it has to be admitted that the ending is a little hard on the credibility. Wayne has promised, \"I'm gonna kill ya, Matt,\" and Wayne has never broken a promise in his life. Yet the climactic fist fight is ended with a couple of wild bullets and harsh words from Joanne Dru, a deus ex girl friend.Basically it's a good watch, especially if you haven't seen John Wayne stretch his acting legs. He takes his John Wayne-ness a little too far and turns into someone we no longer admire, a man with no humor or pity, which is unusual. It happens with far more subtlety in \"The Searchers\" but it always comes as something of a surprise. In most of his movies his character and temperament are unimpeachable.",

            "review_title": "Terrible ending mars an otherwise solid film",
            "content": "This is a better-than-average western that has several things going for it. Good acting, great scenery, impressive cast - including all of the cattle, over 1,000 for sure in some scenes! It appears no expense was spared in the creation of this one. Film in a nutshell: an epic cattle drive serves as the backdrop for the story of a father and (adopted) son's struggle in a battle of wills that borrows heavily from \"Mutiny on the Bounty.\"As good as it sounds, though, it's not perfect. There are a few problems here but the main one is the ending/conclusion/climax. While trying not to spoil it for anyone reading this who has not actually seen it yet, the insertion of the Tess Millay character into the narrative, and her subsequent actions that bring about the climax, really do not work. It feels forced, contrived, even silly. After two hours of tension mounting slowly but surely between father Dunson (John Wayne) and son Garth (Montgomery Clift), it's all resolved in a blink by a character neither man has known for more than a week. This is just not effective story-telling. Several reviewers here mention they allow that the ending of this film is not very good, possibly awful actually, yet still feel compelled to rate it 10/10. Even Roger Ebert stated that the ending hurt the film but still listed it on his \"Great Movies\" list. Well, I can't do that. If there are acknowledged problems with a film, it really should not be given a perfect score. '10/10' should denote that a film was perfect, you wouldn't change a thing. If you find that you would change something here or there, you've got to take it down a peg or two. And with this unsatisfactory ending, it can't be a 10.There are a few other issues. As mentioned it's not exactly original as it does borrow liberally from the \"Mutiny\" plot. There are also some unlikely and inexplicable situations presented here, like when Dunson abruptly leaves the wagon train at the beginning of the film without so much as a discussion with his girlfriend, who he leaves behind. This felt incredibly silly and unrealistic. \"I'll send for you,\" he tells her as he leaves. What? How? She's going to California, he's heading for Texas, and he's just going to 'send for her' later? How exactly is he going to do that without telephones or an address or anything? That's....dumb. There are also some continuity errors, like cows appearing and disappearing behind the wagon on the way to Texas, and Dunson going from holding a whip to a gun in his right hand during the confrontation with Bunk Kenneally. Sloppy.Overall it's still a good film and worth a watch, but I do not find it to be worthy of any 'top 10' lists, there are just too many issues here. It's on the borderline of \"I might watch this again on a rainy day\" but that's about as high as it goes. I've certainly seen better. 7/10.",

            "content": "One of 4 Hollywood films I'm aware of that dramatizes a long cattle drive northward out of Texas. All 4 are worth a watch, if you like westerns, as they are all quite different, with 2 in color and two in B&W. \"The Texans\", starring Randolph Scott, and also including Walter Brennan, preceded this film release by a decade, and is generally considered the least of the bunch in terms of acting and production quality, although it has an interesting complicated plot, incorporating abundant post-Civil War elements into the plot. Like the present film, it involves a pioneering cattle drive from deep Texas to Abilene, KS. However, structurally, it more resembles \"The Tall Men\" in the detail that a woman is a prominent character during the whole drive. In contrast, in this film and the later \"Cowboy\", a promising love match involves a woman encountered along the way, or at the beginning and end of the trail. Realistically, of course, a woman included in the drive personnel would be very unusual, but adds interest and conflict to the long drive.Gary Cooper was the original choice to play the overbearing Dunson character, but he correctly felt that this character didn't fit his image as a fair-dealing hero. Thus, Duke Wayne was given the opportunity to play this ambitious unyielding iconic frontiersman. Clearly, Clift's character(Mathew Garth), as Dunson's unofficially adopted son: the sole survivor of an Indian attack on a small wagon train, emerges as the proximal hero. While they start out as partners, more or less, the impressive stampede destroys most of their food and drink for the trip. Despite having a huge cattle herd, Dunson has no money to resupply this loss, even if he could find such in this desolate landscape. Thus, some of the men try to quit the drive. In response, Dunson is preparing to lynch them, as examples to others who might have the same idea. He can't afford to have most of his men leave. Secondly, some casual wanders report that there is now a railroad to Abilene KS, which is much closer than Missouri, and lacks a border patrol problem. Matt, along with most of the crew opt to head for Abilene. But Dunson nixes this as too risky, since the strangers hadn't actually seen a railhead at Abilene. Besides, they don't know exactly how to get to Abilene. Nearly everyone sides with Matt. So, they leave Dunson with enough materials to survive, assuming that, eventually, he would find some other men to help him hunt them down. Fortunately, the mutineers reach Abilene shortly before Dunson and his new posse gang, and sell the cattle to the friendly stockyard owner for a huge profit.What happens after Dunson reaches Abilene strikes many reviewers as a strange and unlikely climax. Dunson had repeatedly sworn that he would kill Matt when he caught up to him. But, when he meets Matt, he didn't shoot him, no questions asked, as implied. Rather, it's clear that he wanted to show that he was still the better, faster, shot in a gun duel, or the better fighter in a brawl, as a compensatory face-saving challenge to the fact that Matt had usurped his authority as boss, and had guessed right about switching to Abilene. But, he's unable to make Matt respond to a gun duel challenge, despite grazing his cheek. Matt's impressive smirk, in response, makes Dunson abandon the idea of a gun duel in favor of a brutal fist fight, which Matt also initially refuses to participate in, but eventually decides he has to. Dunson is the much bigger man, but he's suffering from a bullet wound just inflicted by another mutineer. After knocking each other about for a while, Tess((Joanne Dru), whom both met on the trail, as a survivor of a decimated small wagon train, has seen enough, shoots around then, ordering them to shop fighting. They are both startled, and have a sudden obliging change of heart about each other. This ending differs from the one in the serial story in the Saturday Evening Post this screenplay is based upon, in which Dunson dies, after lingering from the bullet wound. Considering my interpretation, I think the script writers got it right. Sorry, to those who disagree.As things turned out, Matt is the proximal hero and Dunson the proximal goat. Matt was perhaps lucky, but he and the other mutineers clearly bet on the more promising choice. Not brought out in the film is the fact that driving longhorns into Missouri had been outlawed in many parts of the state, because they brought ticks that carried cattle diseases, and often ate the farmer's crops. Also, rustlers were an important problem in this area, as reported by the casual wanderer.Near the beginning, a pair of Mexicans show up on land Dunson has just claimed he will make into his ranch. They say this land belongs to their absentee boss, who has a long -standing claim to it. Dunson says he doesn't recognize this claim, then shoots one dead and tells the other to inform his boss that Dunson is the new claimant. This demonstrates Dunson's brazen ruthlessness in dealing with impediments to his goal of becoming a cattle baron. It also dramatizes a general attitude of Texans to try to discount prior land deeds of Mexicans.The fatherly Harry Carry plays the stockyard owner, Mr. Melville: a stand in for the historic Joe McCoy.In my opinion, this is a much better story than that for the subsequent \"The Searchers\". It's probably the best acting performance by both Wayne and Clift. The presence of Walter Brennan is another big plus. However, \"The Tall Men\" and \"Cowboy\" also have considerable merit, and were shot in color. Although not, this film certainly has the feel of a John Ford western. Ford was sufficiently impressed with Wayne's acting to star him in a series of westerns.",

Containing every predictably stale Western-movie clich\u00e9 in the book (and then some), Red River's story of (guess what?) a cattle-drive (ho-hum!) pretty much amounted to being nothing more than an all-male soap opera (and spitting contest) of one belly-aching cowboy after another. (yawn!) This sort of tiresome nonsense went on for 2 solid hours. And, then, as a final slap to the face - Red River's story ended on such an ultimately stupid note that it was almost enough to make me want to tear out my hair in utter exasperation.It didn't help matters much that Red River's big-name star was, none other than, John Wayne who, not only had a less-than-impressive screen-presence, but, he always struck me as someone who's thoroughly bored with what they are doing.

            "content": "Wayne's character Dunson foreshadows his Ethan Edwards character in \"The Searchers\". One might say \"Red River\" goes one better by showing how Dunson's dark side develops.I can't believe how many reviews complain about the ending of \"Red River\". The ending of \"The Searchers\" is very similar right? Yet no one complains about that ending.Possible Spoiler:Other reviewers have wondered how is it possible that Dunson kills Cherry just before his showdown with Garth and no one, not even Garth seems to care. I wondered about that too. In a careful viewing of the gunfight between Dunson and Cherry, Cherry is wounded but not killed! He is propping himself on the ground and others come to his aid. They are still around him in the background as Dunson tries to provoke Garth.I think \"Red River\" is one of Wayne's best. It's remarkable when you consider that it was filmed in 1946. Compare it to the film Wayne did just before it; the mediocre \"Dakota\".\"Red River\" was really the film that made John Wayne, not \"Stagecoach\". John Ford didn't give Wayne meaty starring roles till after \"Red River\". Wayne's great movies like \"Wake of the Red Witch\", \"The Quiet Man\", \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\" & \"The Searchers\" all came after \"Red River\".The cast in \"Red River\" was uniformly great. You expect good acting from Montgomery Clift, John Ireland and Walter Brennan. but look at the little roles; the Indian with the false teeth, the Irishman with his funny hat; even that tall geek who started the stampede by stealing sugar. He never made another movie but he nailed his little part.I thought Joanne Dru was fine. Her big scene where she offers to bear Dunson a son was well done. If I'd been Dunson, I would have given up the revenge thing right there.One clich\u00e9 that's always bothered me is the Indian attack on the wagon train. In every movie I've seen of a wagon train attack, the Indians always gallop in a circle shooting into the wagon train. Wouldn't they run a risk of shooting a fellow brave on the opposite side? And why do they always gallop clockwise?",

And all three present the genre in a different fashion.Both of the others occur solely within the compact community where the bad guy(s) and hero have their showdown in the climax.This one involves a mammoth cattle drive, covering hundreds of miles, and with the climax involving the interaction between the two leads, Big John and his adoptive son, played by Montgomery Clift.Clift, whose career was shortened by a death much earlier than expected, is well-remembered and respected for his work. However, his style was decidedly low-key - and on some occasions could be a bit excessively slow and laconic.However, in this film, this style is perfect, and as a counterpart to John Wayne's, which like many of his is the complete opposite.The story here is not one of suspense, and you know pretty much how it's going to end well before the close. It's assets are the lead characters and their performances and relationship, and a fine supporting cast - along with realistic scenery.An added aspect is Walter Brennan, runner-up only to Gabby Hayes as the scruffy, cackling, sidekick, purveying what Mel Brooks called Western \"gibberish.\" As usual for this character, he was in charge of the chuck wagon cuisine for the group.",

            "content": "Everyone seems to agree that \"The Red River\" is a masterpiece with a somewhat questionable finale. Just recall some of its beauties. The magnificent cinematography shows the breathtaking immensity of western landscapes, giving a sense of true epic to the work of cowboys. Few elementary, violent feelings interact among the laconic fellows on the screen: manly friendship, hate, bravery, stoicism, determination. All this is masterly represented: that's actually what we expect from Howard Hawks, one of the greatest directors ever. Now, I would like to give a contribution to vindicate the finale. First, the whole scene is extremely beautiful: the setting in the town flooded with cattle is really an idea of great cinema. However, the problem is that John Wayne - Tom Dunson, usually as ruthless and stubborn to border cruelty, gets to a sudden reconciliation with Montgomery Clift - Matt Garth. This seems to grate much with Dunson's psychology. Well, I think that an explanation is rather simple. There is another elementary feeling, the strongest of all: the love for women. Since Dunson meets Joanne Dru - Tess Millay (by the way: how beautiful she is!), his determination begins to waver. The shrewd girl promptly realizes the situation, and she's ready to offer herself to Dunson in order to save her beloved Matt. By sure Dunson is stricken by the girl's sacrifice and bravery. Perhaps he recalls that his stubborness had caused the death of the only woman he really loved and that, after all, Matt is the actual son Dunson is so desirous to have. Is it then possible that he is wrong, as his old friend Groot Nadine (the great Walter Brennan) continuously repeats to him? Clearly, the key point of Dunson's change is when Tess guesses that he was once in love. Moreover, in the final encounter between Dunson and Matt, the latter refuses to defend himself, and to kill a defenceless man is unacceptable for Dunson's honor code. All these psychological motives are treated by the director and the actors with depth and accuracy. I really think that the finale agrees smoothly with the remainder of the movie. In conclusion, \"The Red River\" is a total masterpiece, with a convincing, faultless finale.",

            "content": "A great genre film is not necessarily a great piece of cinema, for the dictates of genre often run counter to the dictates of art; namely that genre demands familiar elements (aka clich\u00e9s). As good an example of this dictum that can be found is director Howard Hawks' 1948 (although filmed in 1946) black and white western Red River. There is great debate amongst western aficionados as to who was the greater director of westerns, John Ford or Howard Hawks? Well, if one compares the two westerns most consider the two directors' apexes in the genre, Ford's The Searchers and this film, it's no contest. Red River and Hawks win in a walk. That's because Hawks was basically concerned with narrative and characters while Ford obsessed over myth making and caricatures. Even Ford tacitly admitted Hawks was the superior craftsman, for when he first saw Red River he is reputed to have exclaimed, of star John Wayne: 'I didn't know the big son of a bitch could act.' Both films, of course, feature Wayne in an anti-hero role, and both are sweeping tales. But, Red River features realistic characterization, great dialogue and comedy in a first rate screenplay written by Charles Schnee and Borden Chase, which was adapted from Chase's tale The Chisholm Trail. But, above all, the film benefits from the screen debut of Montgomery Clift, who steals the film from Wayne as easily as his character does the cattle herd they are driving north to sell. Note the scene where Matt steps inside a cattleman's office in Abilene. Watch Clift's face as he ducks, because it's been months since he was under a roof. That's the sort of realistic reaction that takes little effort in writing or acting, but adds up to lifting a pedestrian film into a greater realism\u0085. The film reaches out and scrapes greatness in the scenes between Wayne and Clift, as Dunson and Matt. Rarely have two macho male roles been so convincingly written- and considering this was the 1940s, it makes that fact all the more special. Wayne actually emotes a bit above his usual monosyllabics, and Clift acts and reacts to Wayne better than any co-star I've seen. One really gets the sense of their having known each other for years. Two other relationships that work are the ones between Groot and Dunson, especially when Groot finally stands up to Dunson, after years of cowering, and the one between Matt and Cherry, as young gunslingers whose guns stand in for penises in one well written and acted scene that prefigures, albeit far more realistically, some of the homoeroticism that would end up in the laughable vomitus of Brokeback Mountain.But, make no mistake, the major theme of Red River is the classic Oedipal one, where the figurative son must supplant the father, and until the very end, this is the core of the film, and what pushes it well above most westerns. It is a complex film that rises above its genre, but not far enough to reach that ineffable area reserved for the greatest of artworks, even if it can legitimately make a claim to being a great western. Whether or not it would have succeeded in reaching that lofty status without the feminine element is debatable, but that the female element drags it down from unadulterated greatness is not. Now there's a classic trope: blame it on the broads! Yeehah!",

Taken as it is, it is a thrilling and authentic depiction of a cattle drive just after the Civil War.Taken as an allegory, Red River takes on weight.  The more you know about both Mutiny on the Bounty and Moby Dick, the more satisfaction you get from Red River.\nJohn Wayne and Montgomery Clift, at first, seem like unlikely partners, but the differences in their personalities and acting styles works.  The addition of the marvelous character actor, Walter Brennan, and of Joanne Drew and John Ireland,(married at the time, but not lovers in this film,) adds piquancy and humor.Watch for a young Shelly Winters too!Harry Carey's small role just underlines what a natural actor he was.  His son, Harry Carey Jr. is also in this film.John Wayne ages in this film. In the opening few scenes, Thomas Dunson is a young and ambitious rancher who is in love with a beautiful girl, but leaves her to establish himself.  \"I'll send for you,\" he says tenderly and rather shyly, \"will you come?\" She answers, \"Yes!  But you're wrong...\"  John Wayne is gorgeous in these early moments and proves he's both a fine actor and a GREAT kisser!!!  (Women kissed by John Wayne stay kissed for hours afterwards!!!). He becomes a bitter and frightened older man pushing himself and his men to the breaking point to get the herd to the railhead. The drive itself takes on a life and a motion of its own, and is marvelous and terrible to watch. Everyone knows that getting the cattle to market will be the salvation of not just Dunson's ranch, but nearly every ranch in his part of Texas. But Dunson crosses an invisible line and Matt (Clift) takes over and completes the drive.The \"but you're wrong\" first spoken by the girl Dunson loved, is picked up by Walter Brennan to drive home the increasing stubbornness and final obsession that overtakes him.A beautiful film to look at and a rewarding film to savor and watch over and over.

This John Wayne epic is so grand that even he gets lost in it, and actually has to show off some serious acting chops. The Duke more than gets the job done, however as he and Montgomery Clift square off as a father and adopted son at odds during a historic cattle drive. Never before have I agreed with a Roger Ebert review almost to the letter. The film gives us one great setup for two hours, and then just kind of says \"aw heck\" when the ending comes. The female characters seem a bit unnecessary, and they may have played a role in why the ending comes up short.The story involves John Wayne who plays a Texas rancher with thousands of cattle, but nobody close by that can buy them. Since the film takes place just after the Civil War, there is no money for beef anywhere in the South. So Wayne and his son, along with several hired men decide to make a long, dangerous cattle drive to Missouri where there is a good market for beef. Even though the men are warned about the dangers, the payout is too good to resist. But as problems arise, Wayne becomes more and more self-righteous as his men begin to reject his plans. Wayne's son, played by Clift, takes over the drive much to Wayne's chagrin. He plans to take the herd to a closer location in Kansas, even though nobody is certain they even have a rail line to transport the cows once they get there. Wayne swears he will kill Clift once he catches up to him. Will Clift get the cattle to market? What will happen once he has to face Wayne? Unfortunately, this film kind of punts when it comes to the ending. Maybe the makers of this film felt that the kind of ending we'd expect in this day and age would put off the viewers back then. Whatever the reason, we expect a big showdown that never really happens. Another character, Cherry Valance, is built up into a legendary gunslinger and just kind of brushed aside at the end. We expect he will face off with Clift at some point, but it never really happens. In fact the most memorable scene with the two is the homo-erotic moment where the two compare and basically drool over each other's pistols! How did John Wayne ever allow that in one of his movies?? Apparently he was well aware of Clift's sexuality and just avoided him off camera.Red River does have many, many memorable scenes. Hawks absolutely knows how a huge cattle drive should be filmed, and a lot of the scenes look downright dangerous. Especially a nighttime stampede. The film doesn't take any politically correct stance with Indians, either. To these white settlers, they were the enemy and a dangerous adversary. And notice how Wayne shoots the Mexican man and claims all land North of the Rio Grande for himself! Only The Duke could make that scene remotely believable in a movie. Definitely see this film if you can. Not quite great, but generally good and certainly involving. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",

            "content": "No need to repeat consensus points on this classic Western. Instead, there are several lesser aspects I want to bring out.The producers didn't stint on the cattle herd. It's impressive as heck and one of the movie's real stars. Unlike the usual stock shots and projection screen, there's enough real live steak here to feed Chicago. I wish I knew where they got them.To compete on that scale, a towering figure like John Wayne is needed. I've always had mixed feelings about casting the scrawny Monty Clift as Wayne's competitor and co-star. Their fistfight at the end isn't at all convincing given their respective sizes, a disparity the camera tries to make up for. Nonetheless, I have to admit that Clift's low-key manner makes an effective contrast to Dunson's (Wayne) high-key bravado, and becomes sneakily persuasive.The material here is directed by the great Howard Hawks, but is also right up the legendary John Ford's alley, from the strong-willed men and women to the Indian attacks to the trail- hand byplay to the \"winning the West\" theme. As a result, I can't help imagining how Ford would have dealt with the same material. For one, the relationships would be more sentimentalized, especially the ring symbolism that so wounds Dunson's later life. Certainly, the humor would be more boisterous, and, in my view, more distracting. On the other hand, the trail drive would be framed against the far horizon and made memorable thanks to Ford's unerring pictorialism. I'm sure there are other notable comparisons between these two masters, but you get the idea.Anyway, no need to dwell on the obvious positives. The movie remains a classic, thanks mainly to Hawks' over-riding intelligence as both director and producer.",

It really depends on what you think a good Western should consist of. Essential, I think, are tall,lean, dusty loners, enigmatically appearing from the horizon.These lantern-jawed men must face insurmountable odds and win.There must be plenty of guns and sweat-streaked horses about. There must be a hapless heroine, who has nothing-to-do, and she must at some point, despise the loner she will learn to love later. There must be immediate conflict,and it doesn't matter between who.There must be a counter-balancing comic cowboy who is always right, and a crooked bar owner. The villain must despise everything that moves, and be the fastest gun around.Red River has all of these attributes and more.The story revolves around cowpuncher Dunstan(John Wayne)who is looking for a cattle ranch to run.With the help of Nadine(Walter Brennan)and a lad he virtually adopts, this dream is realised. Soon his large herd of cattle needs to be sold, and the film is about this huge endeavour. And it is this huge herd of cattle that gives Red River a unique sweep and grandeur that encapsulates and epitomise the Old West.The sprawl of cattle is everywhere in the picture, and the viewer is drawn into a long-forgotten world of man and beast on the Great American outback. The herd has a life of it's own as the riders struggle to drive them a thousand miles to the railhead. Cinematographer, Russell Harlan, perfectly captures the breadth and scale of the outback, and gives the film a memorable ambiance of light and shade. John Wayne stands tall as the grim Dunstan, and gives a good performance. Walter Brennan is outstanding as Nadine, having already cornered the market on Best Supporting Actor Oscars,(three).John Ireland is excellent as the edgy Cherry Valance, but is wasted by the Director. It is Montgomery Cliff, however, who steals the show as Garth. Not so much for his acting, which is very good, but more for the curiously compelling image he portrays on screen, in all his roles; somehow you can't take your eyes off him.He is stern, ruthless, compassionate and tender; sometimes all at once.He alone is the complete person in the picture, a varied mix of emotions and mood that all of us are prone to.It is a memorable performance. The downside of Red River is the wavering script, which tips some actors into a pit of absurdity from which there is no escape.Joanne Dru as Tess, incredibly falls in love in 2 milliseconds. One minute she is pounding the chin of this stranger; the next she is stroking it.But the best of Red River is the best of all Westerns, the best of all human spirit and endeavour. Along with She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, this movie should be in everyone's collection. I liked one Brennan line;\"I don't like strangers;they never good news me\" Oh, it did lack one important element; where,oh where, was Ben Johnson?",

Set during the Civil War it tells the vengeful story of Colonel Tom Dunson (John Wayne) who is on a mission to drive all his cattle to Red River then all of the sudden his adopted son Matt Garth (Montgomery Clift) turns against him for some reason but we just don't know why he did, then after Matt turns against his adopted father things start to take change between the two of them, and then Dunson bids revenge. Director Howard Hawks made a western masterpiece out of this film and also directed it with skill and craft. What a great western!.",

She's introduced around 93 minutes in. Up to that point everything is fine.The direction of the film takes an interesting turn at around 84 minutes. Wayne is portraying a character that is the opposite of most the characters he often portrays. So........instead of exploring his response to the herd being taken away from him, we get to see Tess Millay(Dru) say/do absolutely nothing significant. Wayne is absent from the film for twenty minutes! What a missed opportunity to create some suspense that would've lead up to an excellent showdown. Unfortunately, the showdown was also a disappointment.I was going to give this film higher marks, but Joann Dru ruined it for me. The cinematography, the tone, the spectacle of the cattle run was impressive, but I will never watch this film again due to Dru!",

I for one do not think it is the perfect film, but it is very well made and directed. My only complaints are its length, for me it was too long by about 10 or so minutes, and the last fifteen/twenty minutes or so, which felt rushed and I didn't completely buy the all is forgiven lark.Flaws aside, Red River is still very good. It looks great, with beautiful cinematography and magnificent scenery. The music by the ever reliable Dmitri Tiomkin is outstanding and enhances the drama, while the script is strong and the story and characters rich and compelling. Red River goes at a good pace, and is brilliantly directed by Howard Hawks, while the acting is very good. John Wayne gives one of his finest performances in one of his more meatier roles as the uncompromising cattle boss, while Montogomery Clift makes an excellent debut and Walter Brennan is wonderful.To conclude, a very good film. With a tighter length and a less hectic ending, it would have been perfect, but I honestly would not mind seeing Red River again. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

He's a loyal old Groot and reprises the role with Jimmy Stewart in The Far Country (1954). Imagine telling the Duke he was wrong on several occasions and not getting a mouth full of teeth! My favorite scene involves the sugar stealing assistant cookie -Bunk Kenneally who causes a stampede and the repercussions of that one little mistake. Rube Goldberg could have charted that one nicely.Dunson's early love interest is quite hot and there's enough smoldering heterosexuality there for the entire film it seems. How could he leave her behind to spend his nights with old Groot? The Duke always put honor and good sense ahead of woman. He did walk kind of funny though now that you mention it.A cowboy named Cherry Valance, he better be good with his gun. Does sound more like a stripper from ValVerde.Mainly I feel that Dunson's executive management style is fascinating. In the opening scenes of the movie, the Duke abandons the trail to California to head to Texas (where real men go) and his excuse is he never signed on. The Duke has reemerged as a Philadelphia lawyer loophole in hand instead of lasso.As he conscripts the band of cowboys that will attempt to save the RRD ranch, he gives them little time to drop out but warns that once they enlist, they can't desert. They are not hands working for wages but actual stakeholders/partners. If they fail to get the herd liquidated they don't get paid. They do get to keep the towels & soap however.The movie also stands as a warning about getting enough sleep. Maybe this is why television was invented. :-)",

Tyrannical cattle driver John Wayne is leading another move from Texas to Missouri. Adopted son Montgomery Clift is becoming tired and upset with the way that Wayne treats him and others. Thus the youngster decides to pull rank and to drive the heads of cattle to Kansas instead and leave Wayne behind. Naturally Wayne is not going to go away without a fight and begins to pursue the young hot-head. Walter Brennan steals every scene as one of the workers on the drive and Joanne Dru ends up being the love interest as it is obvious she has feelings for both Clift and Wayne. Wild action sequences and some varied emotional aspects endear \"Red River\" but the women actually end up hurting the picture as they take away from the relationship Wayne and Clift have. Also the ending seems a bit trivial considering how intense and rough most of the rest of the production is. The resolution seems too sugar-coated and I found that a bit out-there when you think of all the leads had been through with each other. Co-directors Howard Hawks and Arthur Rosson create a wonderful picture in spite of those slight shortcomings. The camera-work is amazing and the performances are consistent across the board. Continues to grow in importance as time passes, \"Red River\" is one of the finer westerns the cinema has ever produced. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",

I have this notion in my head that any red hot Western should stay Red throughout or better turn blue at the end. But turning yellow, well, sorry man but i won't stand for it. It is okay with comedy, romantic films or even War films to have a soft climax but a Western which does not compromise with it's intense surroundings for 2 hours, suddenly turns so soft in last 5 minutes? Why? I don't force others to think my way so you might like it better than me. It's maybe i was having different ideas for the climax while the film was getting more and more intense in the second half and suddenly seeing something terribly underwhelming, i mean this unnecessary womanish touch might have taken away a lot from the overall impact. Nevertheless, it is still a great Western with plenty of swag, stylish scenes and engaging conversations which is more than enough for one time viewing. In the film, Dunson leads a cattle drive, the culmination of over 14 years of work, to its destination in Missouri. But his tyrannical behavior along the way causes a mutiny, led by his adopted son. Having a duel between Dunson and Matt at the end and then some sentimental or intellectual climax would have forced me to call it classic but it misses that. And it misses only that thing, nothing else. Rest, it's an overwhelming western beating out many great contemporary Western classics. John Wayne, Montgomery Cliff and Walter Brennan have given outstanding performances. The cinematography is classy, dialogue are cool and the action scenes including that big cattle riot scene are fantastic. I have seen better films of Howard Hawks so this does make it in my top 5, however I'd like to add that it is most probably because he has a long filmography.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",

Clift when he faced Wayne in the street and Brennen over his teeth with the Indian.

We can all relate to this and the genre translates well to almost any culture. What makes great westerns however (among other movie genres) is when the line is blurred between good and evil, when the hats aren't black or white but a shade of grey. So we come to John Wayne in one of his best ever roles. Sure he was entertaining in the comic westerns with Dean Martin and Robert Mitchum among others but prior to making these he gave some fine dramatic performances. He was certainly no Olivier but on the other hand I can't picture Olivier in a western. To each his own. Red River is a powerful action film with fine performances all round. There's a storyline we can all relate to, excellent camera work with some lasting imagery and a wonderful musical score. If I have to nit pick I could ask where Wayne came up with the money (after telling his men earlier he was broke)to hire the ten or so gunslingers who accompanied him in his pursuit of Montgomery Clift and the renegade crew. These men as it turned out took no part in the story's resolution and I can only wonder why they were in the film. The romantic sub plot looks more than a little contrived as does Wayne's last minute change of attitude towards Clift's character.

John Wayne is superb, and when viewing this film, and John Ford's cavalry trilogy that followed right afterward, one has to wonder why critics ever doubted Wayne's acting ability.  He did win a sentimental Oscar in 1969 for \"True Grit,\" but his gritty performance in \"Red River\" really deserves praise.And Montgomery Clift!  No one thought he could move from the New York stage to the desert southwest, but his performance was excellent in every way, and provides a perfect foil to the driven, maniacal role played so well by Wayne.  Take a look at Clift rolling his cigarette out on the windy prairie. No one could have done it better.The production values are outstanding.  The stampede is both frightening and eerie.  (Good old black and white cinematography!)  The supporting cast contains a number of the old familiar faces, and they look as if they were born to the saddle.The role of Cherry (played by John Ireland) is as large as Wayne's and Clift's in the book, but it is cut to ribbons in the movie, apparently the result of some spat Ireland had with Hawks.  The Hawks biography explains that the book upon which the movie was based was butchered by the screenwriters for reasons that aren't entirely clear.  Certainly, the wagon train episode is unrealistic, as is the introduction of an apparent love triangle, which does nothing more than weakly explain (perhaps) the unusual, even strange, ending of this film.  Ah yes, the ending.  No one liked it:  Not the author, not the screenwriters, not Wayne, not Hawks, not Clift, not Ireland, and not the film critics (at first).  However, the public loved it.  And, all things considered, this is a great picture.  \"Red River's\" majestic sweep is so grand that it ranks as one of the best Westerns ever made, although not quite as satisfying as \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\" or \"The Searchers\" (either one of which could have earned Wayne a Best Actor Oscar).

I was certainly more inclined to get behind Montgomery Clift who, considering it was his first film, was very natural in his role and incredibly handsome. I could have easily got behind him in other ways too. I may have to search out some of his other films.Walter Brennan was a great character as Groot too.There seemed to be a lot of foreshadowing in the respect that I could tell what was going to happen and to whom by what they were saying or who they were talking to. That sort of thing has been far more subtle in more recent films, but appeared more obviously here. It didn't entirely ruin things, but it took away some of the surprise.In general I quite liked the film and once things took their turn and it really sunk it's teeth in to the journey, it was far more enjoyable than the beginning had lead me to believe. So it was a shame that the ending was so very daft. There was a lot of build up for something that really let me down, despite it being a version of the ending I wanted, because the delivery of its resolution was lacking reality and the same seriousness that had been there throughout the film otherwise.Not John's best, but not such a bad film that I would absolutely slate it either.299.19/1000.",

Conflicts along the Chisholm trail during the lengthy cattle drive from Texas to Missouri provide the source of human interest. Noteworthy performances from Wayne and Clift, as well as NOAH BEERY, JR., JOHN IRELAND and WALTER BRENNAN are instrumental in maintaining high interest in the story. And, as usual, the orchestral and choral music of Dimitri Tiomkin adds another dimension.Brennan's character provides some comic relief but it's not overdone, as is sometimes the case. Wayne is brilliant in an unsympathetic role as a tough and stubborn boss determined to get his herd to market in Missouri rather than taking a shorter route to Abilene. When Clift convinces the men on the drive that he'll lead them to Abilene, leaving Wayne behind in defiant contempt, you know there will be a final struggle between the two men at the finale.JOANNE DRU comes into the story toward the last forty-five minutes as a feisty woman attracted to Clift and determined to shield him from the vengeance seeking Wayne who makes no secret of the fact that he intends to kill him when he catches up with him.It's an interesting western, but I thought the ending involving Dru was a bit contrived and not entirely true to the characterizations of Wayne and Clift that went before. Their sudden change of viewpoint after Dru's burst of temper is hard to swallow.Summing up: Among the best of westerns, handsomely photographed on scenic locations.",

Although liberals and conservatives alike can enjoy this as one of the best westerns ever made, only the conservatives will not be disappointed by the ending.From the conservative point of view, this is a coming of age story about family values. Dunson is the strong father displaying a tough love that is harsh but fair. Groot is the mother who provides the nurturing and acts as a morale compass. Matt, of course, is the son who must be taught to be strong and earn the respect of the father. Dunson, a rugged individualist, strikes out on his own and through hard honest work builds a successful ranch out of nothing. Unfortunately, external forces - the Civil War, in this case - subvert his efforts, and we see Dunson tragically going down a path of making increasingly bad decisions. Groot and Matt are forced to apply a little tough love of their own, but in the end the family wins out and Matt earns his mark on the brand.The liberal, from the very beginning, sees Dunson as a morally ambiguous character driven by internal conflicts. When he abandons the wagon train and builds an empire, he does it not just through hard work but the threat of violence as well. He had to kill many men to get where he is, and although we know that he always did it in self-defense, we also know that he never made much of an effort to avoid having been put in that position in the first place. But we still know that he is a man who wants do what is right. Unfortunately, influences both external and internal begin slowly driving him to become a homicidal maniac who no longer knows what is right and wrong. When he kills the wranglers who want to leave the drive, he is the one who draws first. His family has to abandon him in order to protect their own lives, and they live in constant fear of his retribution.\nThen, out of nowhere, a woman doing a blatant imitation of Lauren Bacall in Howard Hawks' earlier films suddenly gets to become a committed member of the family after just one night with Matt. And the film eventually ends in a cliche fight scene where the thick-headed combatants lie in a comic heap while the woman provides the voice of reason. What makes it worse is that this occurs just minutes after Dunson has wheeled and fired on Cherry Valance, killing a man who had not done anybody wrong through the entire movie. Sitting together in their comic heap, Matt doesn't seem to mind that Dunson murdered his best friend just a few minutes ago. Where the movie is brilliant in showing Dunson's psychological decline and the collapse of the family, the redemption at the end is completely contrived. Although we understand the rationale behind it, the movie does absolutely nothing to make it convincing. The conservative doesn't seem to care, but the liberal sees it as a flawed ending to an otherwise extremely interesting film.",

It's a shame the Duke didn't get an Oscar for \"Red River\" -- his Tom Dunson is one of the most three-dimensional characters I've seen in a long time, and this from a 51-year-old movie.  You watch Dunson's gradual descent into and recovery from madness, and you feel for the man because he comes across as a man, not the caricatured John Wayne we cling to.  This is at least as good as the work Wayne did in \"The Searchers,\" which was also snubbed by the Academy.Of course, there are other people in the movie.  I can barely believe this was Monty Clift's first movie; Walter Brennan is excellent as always, and Noah Beery shines as well.

At the end of the film Matt Garth (Montgomery Clift) remarks that it was a long time ago since he had a roof above him. The shooting on location leads to memorable images such as in the stampede scene and in crossing the red river.Apart from the beautiful locations \"Red river\" is about the relationship between Thomas Dunson (John Wayne) and Matt Garth. Dunson is the stepfather of Matt and at first also his master, until his apprentice rebels against him halfway the film. In this respect \"Red river\" is a combination of \"Red beard\" (1965, Akira Kurosawa, master - apprentice relationship) and \"East of Eden\" (1955, Elia Kazan, rebellion against the father).The character of Thomas Dunson is both hero (first half of the movie) and villain (second half of the movie). The way this character moves from ambitious to obsessed is very well played by Wayne. The ending of the film is weak, but that does not spoil the magnificent piece of filmmaking that precedes. In 1971 Peter Bogdanovich made \"The last picture show\", a film about a dead end town in which the only cinema is closing. The last film that this cinema shows is..... \"Red river\". A good choice.",

But as I watched I discovered many other reasons to like \"Red River\".The plot is very interesting. Dunson (John Wayne) is a ranch owner who, with the help of his cowhand, Matt (Monty), is bringing cattle to Missouri. The road is dangerous, but, despite many warnings, Dunson will not divert his path to a safer route.The Duke's acting is at its best in this film (though I can't help but wonder what would it would have been like if Gary Cooper had accepted the role of Dunson), as is Monty's. Also in the cast is Walter Brennan, who is great as always, along with Joanne Dru and others. A great film that I fully recommend.",

            "content": "I watched this just now because, a few days after once again watching \"City Slickers\" (wherein the film's \"yee-ha scene\" is referenced), I happened upon it in my local library and decided to give it a try. I wasn't expecting TOO much, though the involvement of Montgomery Clift gave me cause to think this was perhaps not just another standard John Wayne cowboy film and I knew it was directed by some heavyweight like John Ford or that Hawks fellow. Well...all I can say is that I am sure glad I picked the film up. It's possible I saw this when I was a kid, I guess, but even if I'd remembered doing so I doubt I'd have appreciated its intrinsic worth quite as much then. The film's a masterpiece.I'd only recently watched again \"The Young Lions,\" and I knew that Montgomery Clift suffered bad injuries not long before from a car crash, so when I saw on the title roll that this film was made in 1957 (I swear that's what I saw, though perhaps I'm a little too tired today to be deciphering Roman numerals) I figured that it was shot not long before his crash and the physical changes that resulted. Now I find it was made in 1948...all I can say is that it was way ahead of its time. Thematically and in the acting style, this film reads more like a movie made by very skilled filmmakers a decade later, or even later than that. The cinematography rivals the best, John Ford included, and the acting is first rate from all concerned. Montgomery Clift is subtly compelling -- not an easy quality to get across on the big screen -- but John Wayne is also at the top of his game and ably demonstrates that, with good direction and inspiration, he was more than many think him to be as an actor. Perhaps he had somewhat limited range, but he could act, no question about that. As in \"The Searchers\" (a film I recently watched after getting on a Kurosawa kick and then wanting to go back to see what it was about John Ford, and that film in particular, that so inspired Kurosawa), John Wayne plays a character of questionable moral rectitude, a realistically paradoxical and ambiguous character with flaws, and his character is all the more interesting for it. Walter Brennan, too, is classic in his role and behind the Gabby-Hayesish exterior there's a more insightful and naturalistic aspect to the character that this veteran character player manages to project onto film. John Ireland, too, has a fairly minimized role but burns up the screen when he's on it.The cinematography, in living black-and-white, is nevertheless stunning. There's some innovative camera work, too, including some really cool shots from within the chuckwagon (and, yep, ol' Walter's actually in the driver's seat) as they cross the Red River. It's a long film, too, for the time.For the time, as with a few other true classic Westerns (\"Shane\" leaps to mind, and not just because of the hero's excellent name), this film was grittily realistic in its portrayal of the West as a dusty, muddy place and a cattle drive as the real domain of exploited blue-collar workers just trying to get by. The film somehow manages to mythologize what has become our earlier revisionist view of the West -- the domain of modest heroes and laconic cowpunchers fast on the draw, with many sunsets and beans for dinner -- and foreshadow the later revisionism that portrays the West in a much more realistic light, placing it squarely in terms of the social dynamics of today. It may not be the truth, or even the idealized version thereof, but it is a masterful wrapping of the legend within layers of reality with the additional benefit of a morality tale for the ages.Yee-haw!!!",

            "content": "...but not the one made for TV with James Arness. I just finished watching this original version for perhaps the sixth time, and it always disappoints. It's a great, sprawling story of the west, mostly taking place in the final years of the great cattle drives that were brought to a close by the trans-continental railroads. But it is seriously marred by some dreadful casting. Joanne Dru is truly terrible in this, every emotion seeming utterly faked. And can I be the only one who finds Montgomery Clift totally devoid of charisma? How did he ever get to be a leading man, in this or in anything else? John Wayne is generally a wonderful actor, creating larger-than-life characters that we will always remember, but this character falls short. It's not really his fault but the screenwriter's: his single-minded determination to track down Clift's character and kill him seems as unrealistic as his sudden abandonment of it in the closing scene.The movie is held together by some pretty good performances by some of the usual suspects, Walter Brennan, John Ireland, Noah Beery Jr., Hank Worden. The scenery is decent, but not as gorgeous as we see in many of John Ford's Monument Valley movies. The musical theme is good, but tediously overused.In short, this movie needs a remake. It's a shame when modern actors and directors decide they want to retell an old story, pick something that was done spectacularly well the first time, and embarrass themselves--I'm sure anyone can come up with a long list of such travesties--but occasionally someone notices a film with potential, but that missed the mark the first time around. This could be just such a film.",

            "content": "First, I'd like to mention that I am not, nor ever have been a Western genre film fan. Having said that, \"Red River\" might have just made a believer out of me. Rather than bore you with the plot, which you've probably read, I will say that you simply shouldn't miss seeing this powerful picture. Whether or not you like Westerns, you will appreciate this film for its values which transcend genre. However, the great 'wild west' has significance, as the location of this epic is as important to the film as its fine group of actors. The incredible cinematography (b&w) accents the hills, valleys and water so beautifully that having the color would somehow spoil the experience. A wonderful score adds pace, drama and emotion to a very well-written, fully developed screenplay. And the superlative performances by all players create characters that are new, exciting and unforgettable. Finally, the two lead actors, John Wayne and the new-comer Montgomery Clift, are like two pillars that hold the picture together. It is their performances that keep it moving and interesting. Wayne is on top of his game and the young Clift could have fooled you into thinking that he'd been around a block quite a few times. In reality, this was Monte's only second picture and filmed the same year as his Oscar-nominated performance in \"The Search\", so, really he had been quite an unknown at this point. Therefore, \"Red River\" directors, besides creating an unforgettable picture that it is, also took quite a chance on Clift, with the incredible result. There aren't that many great films around anymore. Treat yourself with \"Red River\" and experience the fun, adventure and the greatness that doesn't come around that often.",

John Wayne as 'Tom Dunson' delivers a powerful portrayal of a complex, hard and uncompromising man who, under the strong direction of Howard Hawks, does not enjoy the luxury being a likable character but one whom we come to dislike intensely. Montgomery Clift does very well in his film debut but Walter Brennan as 'Groot' gives this difficult story of hardship and sacrifice some comic relief which it certainly needs as we watch this difficult story unfold. Red River generally follows a trail herd up the Chisum trail in 1865 and is largely fictional but very realistic. We watch the 'Dunson' character change before our eyes to become a tyrant, both thoughtless and cruel. Very few people will cheer the character that John Wayne portrays in this film but nearly all of us who appreciate a performance of a lifetime will applaud the acting job that the 'Duke' did in Red River. John Ireland as 'Cherry'and some faces familiar to us all round out the field. What a film, near perfection!!!!!!!",

Mutiny on the Bounty transposed to Texas, and although John Wayne is obviously no Charles Laughton, he does a decent job as the obsessive, driven, teetering on the brink, losing his soul Boss. But what I want to concentrate on is the way the three scenes with Joanne Dru stick out like the sorest of sore thumbs, and clash horribly with the rest of the film. Her first scene, when Montgomery Clift is shooting Indians next to her is bad enough, with her talking to him like they'd known each other for years, and slapping him for no apparent reason. But the scene with Clift outside the camp is just plain ridiculous, and grates against the gritty realism of the previous hour. Similarly her next scene with John Wayne - again, incomprehensibly ridiculous. I know all about the apparent need for a love interest - but this is such a good film, and this particular case of the tradition is so obviously tacked on as an afterthought, and so awful that it just seems such a shame. I really think that Dru's scenes could be cut out and nothing would be lost, and we'd be left with a much better film.",

The film also covers human activities as relevant then as they are today, man management skills, delegation and the stress caused when these skills are absent.The Joanne Dru role is somewhat superfluous, particularly her rant at the end of the film, and like many other reviewers I think the one area that lets the film down is the ending.Overall excellent though and one I shall watch many times on DVD.",

John Wayne plays a stubborn cattle hand named Thomas Dunson whose wagon train is wiped out by Indians leaving a lone boy survivor. Several years pass and Dunson's successful rise of cattle and selling beef comes under threat when poverty strikes so he recruits several men to drive the cattle to Missouri where a chance to sell the cattle is promising. From here the screenplay becomes extremely episodic with a stampede caused by someone's idiocy. Eventually a division is caused when Dunson's leadership becomes too heavy handed and his cattle is overtaken. Howard Hawks captures the era but the climax is corny with its fistfight make up conclusion. Wayne is effective as the hard driven Dunson who demands commitment when a task is underway. Montgomery Clift is superb as the grown boy who will challenge Dunson's authority. Walter Brennan plays Dunson's partner through life. Only Joanne Dru is pathetic as a woman in love with Clift after an awkward meeting. Mickey Kuhn plays the younger version of what would become Montgomery Clift.

It sets the standard for so many subsequent trail drive stories, not least among them Lonesome Dove. In addition to all the action you could possibly ask from a wild west show (gunfights, bullwhips, Indian attacks, a stampede, knife fights, etc.), the film also contains one of John Wayne's best performances. I think he was at his best when playing a character with a dark side, a less-than- likable character, and his work here is on a par with his similar portrayals in films like the much-ignored Three Godfathers and the superb The Searchers. In RR, he is backed up by the great Walter Brennan. Red River is one of my favorite films. Check it out, you won't be sorry.",

The main action of the cattle drive is exciting in itself, harking back to a heroic era after the Civil War when new territories were carved out of the wilderness under great duress, but of course the relationship between John Wayne's Dunston and Montgomery Clift's Matt is what makes the film so revered. John Wayne is John Wayne in all his films but that means he is always the anchor while in this case Monty's at times almost Gary Cooper like effusion provides a nice foil. The ending is most satisfying. My only qualm is that the female roles were somewhat underwritten and those great actresses were therefore underutilized. But then again the dynamic of the film might have had to been radically changed so scratch that criticism. Highly recommended, 9/10",

I don't agree with a previous reviewer, that John Wayne raised his game for this one. I'd call it a standard Wayne performance. Which is OK with me. Having just seen it again though, what sticks in my mind is the fate of Cherry Vallance. John Ireland seldom got as high up the cast list as he did here. He's good as the gunny who, we are assured, will have to go up against Matt, sometime before the end of the trail. One of thems gonna get killed, but it doesn't seem to be spoiling anybody's day much. This is a bit odd as they're awful jumpy when it's old Dunson who's on their trail. Anyway it turns out that Cherry plays the good guy all along. When Dunsons about to gun Matt down, and we are suddenly led to believe that we've always known Matt couldn't pull the trigger on Tom, Cherry makes his one aggressive move in defence of his pal and is dismissively shot down. Does he die? Quite likely, but we don't know coz in the slightly cheesy dying moments of the film, just a minute or two after Ireland went sprawling in the dust, nobody including his buddie he moved to save or the girl of the buddie he may have died to save, gives a goddamn about what happened to him.

I only wish it had been shot in color - the cattle drive scenes would have been all the more impressive. I was disappointed to not see Clift's character Matthew go head-to-head with Cherry Valance, as we were led to expect, since both were played up as two of the fastest guns anyplace, and their eventual 'tangling' was said to be inevitable.

It strikes such a great balance and even watching this now in 2022 it doesn't feel slow or too outdated, a show of its excellence. It reminded me a lot of the TV show 1883 I watched a bit ago, I could see Red River possibly inspiring that show a bit.John Wayne, and his character, just... so good. The complexity and confliction is fantastic. You know how it ends but also don't, them movie and it's well written characters keep you guessing.''Stumpy'' is back from Rio Bravo, Brennan gives a lovely performance, curious to know if he's always been this goofy. But he does it well. And it feels way less over the top than in Rio Bravo where sometimes it just didn't work for me and felt more like a caricature.Matthew Garth, Clift, is great, not much to note other than that he stood up pretty well against Wayne. Honorable mention to John Ireland (Cherry) as well. Love the shooting session between these two.Compared to the later Rio Bravo I enjoyed the dialog in Red River way more. It felt more grounded and the jokes were great. Still, a weak point in Red River and Rio Bravo so far has been the female dialog, especially the romantic parts. Maybe it was realistic back then, I doubt it though, it's just too over the top. Luckily Red River had a lot less of it.Directing is fantastic and that combined with the music this really felt like an ''epic'', it really was this diverse and tough journey you take on. The movie never sticks around too long, start up phase doesn't overstay it's welcome and we get going pretty fast. Lot's of things happen underway to make the 2 hour and a bit runtime worth your while. All the while the entire social dynamic and character arcs are unfolding. Arcs which finalize in the finale albeit a bit too fast for my liking, though it was good.Like I said I really love the music composed for this. It's just small and big. And really is a tune you're not gonna forget quickly. It's both epic, adventurous and contemplative.Action scenes are done extremely well. There's a real sense of grounding, and you know there's no CGI, it's all real and you can see the actors and stuntmen struggle to stay on their horse here and there, just like it would be hard in reality. The visuals are impressive too, the amount of cattle, horses and people. Never feels like the bare minimum.If anything I wish this movie was in color and in a modern aspect ratio because it deserved it. Either way it still looks great.",

            "content": "With a beef surplus in Texas, rancher Thomas Dunson and his young partner Matthew Garth decide to undertake a hazardous thousand-mile cattle drive to Kansas. With ten thousand steers to control and countless dangers ahead of them, will they make it ?This is one of The Duke's best films, and technically one of the most impressive westerns ever made. The big shots of the endless lines of cattle moseying past are jaw-dropping - how on earth they managed to organise these is bewildering. It has several well-mounted, exciting sequences; an early Indian attack at night, a horrifying stampede, a great river-fording scene with some amazing shots from the back of Brennan's wagon, an incredibly sensuous foggy love scene with Clift and Dru. It also pulls a great switch halfway in, as Garth and the rest of the hands mutiny against Dunson's tyranny and leave him behind. From that point on it almost becomes a sort of horror movie, complete with Gothic style and characters jumping at shadows. There's also a great kick in the pants from Dru as the good-time girl Tess; she's a classic Hawksian woman, full of smarts, tough talk, and sex appeal, and a welcome relief from all the macho swaggering. The film has a few faults though - at times the steer shots seem like endless travelogue, Dimitri Tiomkin's score is suitably bombastic but a little overdone (especially in the first half-hour) and Dunson and Garth's reconciliation at the end is just plain silly. The whole cast are pretty good though; this was Wayne's first real attempt to develop a complex character with an unheroic side, Clift gives a wonderfully quiet aw-shucks performance (don't miss his tin-can shooting scene with Ireland), Brennan grimaces his patented feisty old coot part well, and Dru is sensational - check out the scene where all she wants to do is put her fingers in Clift's mouth. There is a treasure trove of ubiquitous character actors with unusual connections. Sharpshooter Ireland later married leading lady Dru. Carey Jr, who plays Dan the stampede victim, is the son of Carey Sr (the money man at the end), and the son-in-law of Fix (one of the two runaways). I particularly like the moon-faced Worden, who was in everything from The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty to Twin Peaks. Beautifully shot (mostly in Arizona) by Russell Harlan, and based on a Saturday Evening Post story by Borden Chase, centred around the western legends of the Chisholm Trail from San Antonio to Abilene. Geography fans please note, the Red River of the title (there are lots in North America) is the one on the border of Texas and Oklahoma, and not the slightly larger Colorado River (literally named Red River by the Spanish), which is further west. All in all, this is a great western, possibly the best of the forties. Hawks and Wayne improved on it in colour and widescreen with the more laid-back Rio Bravo years later, but this is still a great all-American classic.",

But last year \"The Searchers\" was forced upon me by a friend and my eyes were opened.  Like most genres (sci-fi, horror, romantic comedies, etc.), Westerns are largely crap with a core of really wonderful movies.  I just re-discovered another. Yes, I know I'm a little slow on the draw but I am now a fan of \"Red River\". Sure, \"Red River\" is full of the things that I'd come to negatively associate with Westerns. The hardly rousing men's chorus soundtrack may have fit at the time but it is one of the few things that has been left behind over the years. And, or course, it's got manly men who don't take no for an answer and shoot those who insist on giving it to them. Finally, it wouldn't be a classic western without caricatured \"Indians\". Not that this is a huge point of contention.  Kind of hypocritical to go back and judge the past from my \"enlightened present day\" mindset. Nevertheless, I was really impressed with so many aspects of \"Red River\".It didn't just stand out amongst Westerns but amongst good movies of any kind. The pacing was fast and well-done. The action sequences were exciting (including a flaming arrow that flys right at you like the bullets in \"Apocalypse Now\")! The characters were multi-faceted and the acting was notably good (esp. Wayne as Dunson). Dunson's character begins with heroic resolve and grit but due to weariness, stubbornness, and pure paranoia turns into a tyrannical Captain Ahab.  This is early enough in Wayne's career that he hasn't completely become a caricature of himself.  This is John Wayne playing Thomas Dunson not John Wayne playing John Wayne playing Dunson.  Montgomery Clift as Matthew Garth is pretty good too. Finally, the humor kept \"Red River\" from not taking itself too seriously. It was surprising how many of the scenes have retained their charm and made the transition to the new millenium.  Especially those containing Groot the cantankerous old cook who had no qualms about telling the dreaded Dunson (to his face) that he was wrong and he knew it. The one thing that held \"Red River\" back from being, basically, perfect was the hastily resolved, corny \"chuck-on-the-shoulder\" ending.  I buy the reconciliation between Matt and Dunson.  As believable as their estrangement was given the events and their personalities, reconciliation was closer to their true relationship than anger.  I don't agree with those that wanted a bloody ending.  What I didn't like was how exactly they were reconciled. One poorly-acted, slightly unintelligible rant by a lass (however winsome and gun-toting) isn't quite enough to turn these men into chuckling little boys.  Surely this could've been better done. However, its few limitations are far from keeping this gem from being memorable and excellent.  I'm proud to consider myself a fan! (GRADE: A)",

I always liked the Duke best when he played a darker character-such as \"The Searchers\" or \"Sands of Iwo Jima\"- and in RR he's nasty. Thomas Dunston is stubborn and obsessed with driving his catttle to market from south TX to Sedalia Mo, over 1000 miles and he is the absolute authority of law and order and right and wrong on this drive. Hawks makes this an excellent study of men working togther under conditions few of us can comprehend.The only weakness in this movie, and I'd give my rating 9 1/2 instead of 10 if the halving option was available-is the ending. I've read the original was going to have his surrogate son Mathew (Monty Clift in a solid performance) fatally wound Dunston in an climactic duel after Matt had taken over the herd from Dunston, in a sagebrush mutiny after the wranglers had all become with fed up with Dunston's tryanny. Instead, Hawks-no doubt pressured by the studio-goes for the happy ending where Joanne Dru-traveling in a wagon train of prostitutes crossing from New Orleans to SF that Matt and that cattle drive conviently run into-gives a sappy speech about the two of them really love each other, etc, etc. And all is well and good.",

Unfortunatly, the movie cops out at the end, but up until then it's great. Wayne was a great actor. Able to go over the top if he has to too, but here playing against the always great and understated Clift, Wayne is subtle, powerful and brillant.",

            "content": "Red River is a 1948 Western, often regarded as one of the best of it's genre, directed by Howard Hawks and starring John Wayne, Montgomery Clift and Joanne Dru.\nI was pleasantly surprised by this film, I went into it not knowing much and enjoyed the watch a lot. I wasn't a big fan of Westerns but I'm starting to really appreciate the genre with some classics like The Searchers, Rio Bravo and The Wild Bunch now being some of my favourite films of all time, and while I don't think Red River is as great as the mentioned previously I still find it very remarkable.\nThe acting is mostly really good with the standout performances being, for me, obviously John Wayne and Montgomery, Wayne plays a hero and a villain as Dunson in one of his best and more complex performances, kind of like in The Searchers and Clift playing his surrogate son, but also the alaways hilarious Walter Brennan who would later team up again with Wayne in Rio Bravo.\nI think the film has a great premise that translates into a very interesting story helped by some great cinematography. My biggest problem which I haven't seen anyone talk about, so maybe I'm the only one who thinks that way is that the romantic subplot feels very forced in.\n8.7/10",

The latter one isn't among my favorite though and this movie is unfortunately one of those movies.It's a movie about its story and characters. I wish it weren't though. For a movie that is being called spectacular it's a surprisingly slow and dull one. The movie is cattle drive from south to north, in which characters rebel, fall in love and loose their lives. It all also wasn't anything too surprising really and the movie progresses formulaic.It's no bad movie but from Howard Hawks and John Wayne you should simply expect something extra. Something that this movie just did not provided. It's a well made movie and all and also its story in essence is a well written one but the movie just ain't anything too special or original.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

He happened to live just 2 blocks away, so I could just walk to his home.When I was invited into the finished basement (most all homes in Altadena and Pasadena for that matter don't have basements) I noticed the walls lined up with John Wayne pictures. When I asked him about that, Ray Hyke (as Walt Jergens in this movie) told me that he was an actor and did several of these movies. I looked closer to the photos and did recognize him as one of the actors. Thought that was cool.I never met another actor in Altadena, except that Zane Grey's wife asked my mom if I could work for her at one time.

Fear and punishment are the law. Men cannot accept they are wrong, as imposing themselves is essential for keeping authority. Authority is perceived as necessary in a place where the strong gets what he wants and the weak is killed if he does not accept to obey. John Wayne has one of his best roles: an authoritarian and stubborn cowboy and gunman. There are quite nice characters, besides Wayne's Tom Dunson, each one representing one archetype: Monty Clift is the good and handsome gunman Matt Garth, Walter Brennan is the funny elder Groot, and John Ireland is the arrogant and dangerous Cherry Balance. The movie is also very well filmed, with quite impressive cattle footage. In my opinion, this is one of the best Westerns made in the United States in the classic times of this genre, before the 60's and its many reinventions: perhaps only High Noon and Ox-bow Incident are better.",

In it, a headstrong rancher (John Wayne) heads a cattle drive from Texas to Missouri but, along with the usual hardships, he soon faces resistance from his own men due to his tyrannical ways.Wayne gives a top notch performance as the type of guy that you definitely do not want to tangle with. However, Montgomery Clift, playing his adopted son, takes up that challenge and succeeds admirably. Walter Brennan and John Ireland stand out in support while Joanne Dru is satisfactory as the romantic interest.Visually, Hawks' direction is well-handled, as always, and the film contains some nice scenery. The editing garnered one of the film's two Oscar nominations and Dimitri Tiomkin's lively score deserves special mention.The other of the film's two Oscar nominations went to Borden Chase for his screen story. Personally, I think that the story might be stretched a bit at 133 minutes and I'm not absolutely crazy about the ending but these are fairly minor complaints.

Sadly, Hawks was not Hitchcock, Dru couldn't lift Bacall's jockstrap, and RED RIVER ranch mobster Wayne wouldn't have lasted five minutes in a Bogart gang. Only Trump voters would try to shoehorn RED RIVER between THE MALTESE FALCON and CASABLANCA on a list of Classic American flicks. Maybe there's an Alternate Universe in which Ms. Dru would NOT stick out like a sore thumb if positioned between Mary Astor and Ingrid Bergman, but I'm mighty glad I don't live there.

Flash forward to the last half of RED RIVER, and this same Dunson is killing deserters from his own foolhardy cattle drive left and right, bellowing to the cowering survivors, \"There's quitters to be buried!\" While some might label this seeming inconsistency on Tom's part as hypocritical, it actually typifies the sort of bold (or brazen; take your pick) thinking that always has distinguished America's ruling class from--to use the late hotel mogul Leona Helmsley's term--\"the little people.\" Yee-Hah!",

The film has an assurance and flow one expects from a master, with beautiful black-and-white photography, a great Dmitri Tiomkin soundtrack (what's a western without Dmitri Tiomkin), majestic rolling scenery, lots of cattle, horses, and an all-star cast. Wayne has always been at his best playing characters with a touch of paranoia, and he gives one of his greatest (if not THE greatest) performances as hard-bitten cattle baron Tom Dunson a man who will stop at nothing, not even murder, to accomplish an apparently impossible task: leading the first cattle-drive from cash-poor, post-Civil War Texas, to the North, which had plenty of money but a shortage of beef. Wayne shares the spotlight with a young Montgomery Clift as his adopted son, a man with an equally quick temper but a stronger moral compass, and Walter Brennan has never been better as Wayne's sidekick. John Ireland drifts in and out of the film as gunfighter Cherry Valance, whose projected showdown with Clift never materializes (instead he's gunned down by the Duke!) The film falters in the middle, with an improbable love interest added by Joanna Dru, but makes up for it with a brilliant ending (in which Miss Dru plays a key role).

It's a power struggle between John Wayne's and Montgomery Clift's characters and what they represent.I'm going to be brief here and leave the in-depth analysis for others. Wayne is outstanding -- this is among his best performances -- and Clift is superb.The great flaw is Joanne Dru, who is pretty but can't act. She stands out, and that's not good.

What could have been a tighter, smaller (while it's easy to miss, the movie also deserves recognition for the scenes concerning the actual cattle drive which I can imagine took more effort than one might immediately surmise) 90-100 movie is stretched out to something far longer than it should be.

Bogdanovich, who proved with his supposed Classic THE LAST PICTURE SHOW that he couldn't SELECT--let alone DESIGN--a sexy brassiere to save his life, bad-mouths American genius Howard Hughes here simply because Hollywood Maverick and noted lingerie engineer Hughes was too sharp (even at the height of his madness) to grant the fawning sycophant Peter an interview. (Which, I guess, is a good thing, as it saves Civilization from listening to Bogdanovich rhapsodizing over \"My Great Friend Howie's\" bottled pee collection.) As mean-spirited as Peter Bogdanovich can get with anyone unavailable to add to his career roster of names-to-be-dropped, he does provide a fairly succinct comparison of the two versions of RED RIVER included in the Criterion set.

            "content": "This is one of my least favorites of John Wayne's \"big\" pictures. I've watched it before, but this time around I wanted to pay more attention to why I dislike it.Reason number one: Americans today can't really relate to cattle drives. We all can relate to the story in \"Rio Bravo\" and \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence\", because we all still know bullies. What do Americans today know about cattle? Well, they see the steak or the hamburger, but can't relate to farming and cattle drives. Usually there might be a love story in the mix, but that angle is killed off in the first few minutes of the movie, and love doesn't resurface until late in the picture. And by the way, when they have a freshly killed steer, why not eat the meat and relieve the men of one crisis -- the constant complaints of beans, beans, beans.Reason Number two: This is one of several John Wayne films where Wayne's character goes over to the dark side, but here for no apparent reason. Three men want to quit the cattle drive, but Wayne doesn't want to lose any cowboys, so he murders them. How exactly does that make him not lose cowboys? And then he announces that he's going to kill has \"adopted\" son because he doesn't constantly kiss his butt. Wayne is awfully unlikable here.Reason number three: The audience isn't dumb. We can see the same ridge in the shots in what is supposedly action covering several separate days.That's not to say that there aren't some good things in this film. And the most important of all is the surprisingly fine performance of a young Montgomery Clift. Not surprising in that he was a very fine actor, but surprising because who really sees him as a cowboy? And then there's the blessing of another superb performance by one of Hollywood's most dependable actors ever -- Walter Brennan. There are several other fine character actors here, as well -- Noah Berry, Jr., Harry Carey Jr. and Sr. (!), and Paul Fix, among others.The cattle drive is looooooooong, and the ending, when Wayne catches up with is son in Abilene ends in a totally unrealistic way. He's ready to beat and murder his son, but a silly and frantic speech by the boy's girlfriend takes away all his anger.If you can overlook the inconsistencies, it's a pretty good film.",

While contemporary film scholars often obsess over the homosexual subtext as Clift and co-star John Ireland compare guns (\"maybe you'd like to see mine?\"), the heart and soul of the film is the surrogate father/son chemistry between Wayne and Clift, how obsessed Wayne is with land, and how betrayed he feels. All of Wayne's innermost insecurities come out well in a speech about how he \"can't live forever\", wanting a son as someone to pass his hard-earned land/cattle on to. Usually a solid rock of machismo, Wayne is at his most heartfelt, and viewed for a third time, his performance comes across as magnificent. Not so impressive is Dimitri Tiomkin's score. It is atmospheric but also melodramatic at all the wrong times, especially during Wayne and Clift's shoot-out halfway in. Wayne's descent into sleep deprived madness also disappoints as we are told more than shown how he is losing his grip on reality. The film additionally has some pacing issues, but overall, it is engaging and stands up very well to repeat viewings with a tangible human drama element constantly elevating it above genre clich\u00e9s. There are several fun moments of comic relief too, such as how one man takes an incredibly long time warming up to signing his name, only to then write an X on the document.",

Wayne is his usual cool and commanding cowboy, though even he fails to act convincingly when the script calls for him to act sad.For a 1940s film, Red River is very well-acted and well-written, but it does still have its faults. Several of the cast act poorly, the music is often campy, and the editing needs a lot of work, especially in the choppy jarring transitions and the timing of the \"diary\" notes. While Red River is a good movie for its time, it is still very clear this movie comes from early cinema.A little nitpicking, but the path they travel in the beginning is nonsensical. There's no reason for them to travel through the Panhandle, which is north of the Red River. is at Why does Tom say the land south of the Oklahoma border looks good for ranching and then travel at least 500 miles southwest past the Pecos region to the Rio Grande? I guess that's technically south of the Red River, but there's no reason to believe Tom has actually seen that land before because he was traveling from St Louis for his first trip to Texas.",

            "content": "There are some truly powerful and amazing sequences in this film, including the beginning of the trail drive, and the stampede. One great bit takes place in a drenching thunderstorm, with chuckwagon cook Walter Brennan's tent barely managing not to collapse in the downpour, as he serves up bad food and worse coffee to the grumbling cowpokes. One probably has to see this movie a number of times before realizing the depth of John Wayne's performance as the unlikable rancher Dunston. He behaves like a total s.o.b. at times, but there's a reason behind his obnoxious acts. This is a man who has gambled everything on one desperate attempt to salvage something of his dwindling fortune. His biggest fault is his inability to admit being wrong about anything, and his tendency to see anyone who dares disagree with him as disloyal. I finally began to understand the character a little more after my last couple of viewings. SPOILERS AHEAD: When his adopted son Matt and the other cowboys leave him tied up, and take away his herd to go a different way, he threatens to find and kill Matt one day. This makes complete sense from his viewpoint. He feels that he's been betrayed by everyone, and his property stolen by those he trusted most. He's still a tyrannical s.o.b., but there's a certain logic to his attitude. The only person who can dare tell him he's wrong, and get away with it ,is Walter Brennan's Groot, and Dunston won't always listen to him ,either. Now for the critical part: I have very mixed feelings about the presence and character of Joanne Dru in the latter part of the movie. In the first of two recent viewings, after not having seen the movie for a long time, I was amazed at the incredibly obvious Lauren Bacall imitation she does, right down to the eyebrows and the vocal mannerisms. The lines she is given make her scenes with Wayne and Clift come dangerously close to self parody by Hawks. It seems as if she's wandered in from a different movie, and basically she has. She's essentially replaying Bacall's character from To Have and Have Not in her scenes with Wayne, and Jean Arthur's character from Only Angels Have Wings in her scenes with Clift. Whether Hawks did this as an elaborate inside joke, I don't know. The dialogue in her scene where she half seduces, half threatens Wayne, is borrowed almost word for word from Bacall's scene with Bogart, even to the bit about walking around to see if there are any strings attached. When she asks some of Clift's cowboy friends how to talk to him, the dialogue again is remarkably close to that of Jean Arthur asking the same questions about Cary Grant in OAHW. Many people have written about the anti-climactic ending ,that should either have been the movie fistfight to end all, or a shootout with either Wayne or Clift dead, or both. Instead, we get the two men starting to slug it out ,and then Joanne Dru stops them by shooting at them and demanding that they realize how much they love each other. Once again, her dialogue here is close to lines Bacall had in both The Big Sleep and To Have and Have Not. The movie ends on a note of low comedy, rather than grand tragedy, and one is left shaking one's head in disbelief. What was Hawks thinking? On the other hand, I have to admit that her love scene in the fog with Clift, and her later meeting with him in the hotel bedroom, are two of the sexiest things I have ever seen in any movie, and almost justify her presence in this flick. It's also true that Hawks tended to re-use a lot of the same material frequently, and was supposed to have remarked that if a director was going to steal from other directors, why not the best, which was himself? I think this would be a much better film without her presence, but you could say it makes Red River a sort of misfired masterpiece, in which the strong characters and storyline still manage to outweigh the stranger aspects of it.",

All this leads to one of the biggest cop-out endings of all time. John Wayne and Montgomery Clift's characters are headed to the ultimate showdown. Only one should be left standing (take your pick).

            "content": "Whenever I review a film as old as \"Red River\"--75 years at this writing!--I try to balance how it has held up over time versus my estimation of how it was received on release date. I settled on 6/10 here--not strong enough to drive home all the necessary character beats, but thematically strong and a clear jumping-off point for John Wayne's rise to Western genre legend.For a very basic overview, \"Red River\" tells the story of Thomas Dunson (Wayne), a Texas cattle rancher decimated by the Civil War and needing to drive his enormous herd to Missouri for profit. Setting out with adopted \"son\", of sorts, Matt Garth (Montgomery Clift), the expedition encounters the usual obstacles: harsh terrain/weather, Native Americans, stampedes, and the low morale caused by Dunson's hard-driving personality. When a decision must be made to press on towards MO or head towards Abilene, KS--where a railroad may or may not exist--it splits Tom & Matt and sets up the conflict that drives the film's climax.Though not directed by John Ford (Howard Hawks, rather), \"Red River\" shares some of the deeper thematic themes of Ford's \"The Searchers\" collaboration years later with the Duke. There are easily-identifiable themes/characters set up in the beginning of the picture that are paid off in the end. That alone--for the time--likely made it stand out in the largely \"cowboys vs Indians\" Western tropes of the time.The problem with \"Red River\" as opposed to \"The Searchers\", however, is that the latter embedded its themes perfectly throughout the film while the former is far more ham-fisted. In other words, there is little nuance in \"Red River\"--everything is either spelled out explicitly for the viewer or not quite followed up on like it should be. I'm unsure if this had more to do with direction/writing or the 1948 release date.Regardless of my personal thoughts on the film's overall quality, one thing I can easily see is how it can serve as a wonderful pre-cursor to some of Wayne's later successes. Some examples...-Wayne is joined by Walter Brennan, Harry Carey, Harry Carey Jr., and Hank Wooden--all keys players (in the flesh or in spirit) of later projects.-This is the movie that convinced Ford \"the big SOB could act!\". When allowed to fully flourish, Dunson's descent into madness is indeed impressive from Duke.-Duke's persona and mannerisms really take shape here--everything from walk, talk, facial expressions, and personality.-The oft-used Wayne film tropes of \"women being a civilizing force\" and \"youngster standing up to the old guard\" are in full force as well.So, while the pure viewing experience of \"Red River\" might wax or wane depending on the individual viewer, it is without a doubt an \"insider's preview\" of the kind of actor John Wayne would ultimately become.",

Brennan excels as the character actor Stumpy while Wayne is an imposing presence as the somewhat embittered Tom Dunson. The epic scale of the cattle drive being attempted by Dunson is fantastically portrayed by the director Howard Hawks and as you follow the drive on its journey you begin to become immersed and feel you are actually part of what is happening. The ending turns out to be a bit of a sting in the tale considering the way the storyline pans out and if you are looking for twists and turns during the film itself you will not be disappointed The film is one that can't fail to capture the heart and in my view this is a film everyone should make an effort to see.",

It would have been much better if Gary Cooper had played Dunson, as was originally intended. Overall just a slow, dated, overlong and boring old racist western with the racist McCarthyite Republicans Wayne and Walter Brennan doing their usual bad \"acting\".

I would have Wayne tell Clift he was going to show up and confront him some day, leaving it as a veiled threat of some type of retribution. But when Wayne shows up at the end, I would let the surprise be that Wayne realized Clift did the right thing and - like when Jacob and Esau meet in the Bible - they make up. I would just have Wayne shoot Cherry's gun out of his hand and not really hurt him. Then I'd have Wayne make a dramatic speech to the effect that \"it takes a big man to admit when he's wrong and I'm a big man\" and then show Clift how the brand will be changed to include him with the M.",

In Red River John Wayne (shorn of his usual handsomeness at that age) owns the screen and allows Monty to share the edges and in the Misfits Clark Gable does the same. That is because no matter what the current polls or movies show us, there is nothing as attractive as an American hero in full flower and yes, the metrosexual is charming but the man is still the center.

The gunfight between Matt & Cherry is also particularly endearing. And, in response to the discussion below, of course guns are phallic symbols. Why else would Westerns have been created after the World Wars?

Not Howard Hawks, who kills his heroine in the first reel and only makes a single further heterosexual gesture near the end. There are no women necessary in the bulk of this consensual \"Deliverance.\" \"Red River\" is a tangle of love stories about unwashed, virile men in fatal competition for the attentions of other big-ironed cowboys. Generally the melodramatic subplots play out Oedipally, with a hero-worshiping gunsel eager to live up to his surrogate father's stern embrace (Walter Brennan to John Wayne, Montgomery Clift to John Wayne, Walter Brennan to Montgomery Clift, the trailhands to John Ireland.) But a new dynamic is introduced about a third of the way in - Montgomery Clift gets a crush on John Ireland, and they're equals in every way: youth, beauty, skill with a phallic symbol. (The dialogue is Hawksian patter, screwball-timed and stunning [\"Can I see it? Maybe you'd like to see mine.\" \"Hey, hey, that's good too.\"] It's a Cary Grant/Rosalind Russel concoction set on the prairie as an all-male revue.) The Duke gets jealous and the old generation has to deliver a little butt-paddling to the whippersnappers.Wayne is intermittently at his best (there is no movie in which he is always good, and he is bad for all of most of them) as a brutal, paranoid dictator, a role he would retread with more consistency in \"The Searchers,\" and he really means it when he says he's gonna kill his son.

There these cowboys take whatever they want and as many animals they could with the intention to sell them later as good prices and taking advantage of lack of meat, so they decided to bring the herd to Missouri. The way to bring cattle was too long, and some cowboys thought that it would be the same to bring it to Kansas where the prices could be the same. Dunson, behaving as a dictator, did not accept this idea and it brought about a rebellion led by his adopted son Matt (Montgomery Clift). Dunson was left alone and the cowboys did what they wanted, but Dunson  still wanted to kill Matt as act of revenge. The end of the film is a bit naive or it is the normal `Hollywood happy end', because he and Matt after fighting became friendly again once Matt's girl-friend stopped the fight and asked them to make peace.

Sure, there's character development - but it's all related to the cattle drive!  Wayne's character becomes more unreasonable as the movie progresses, and his leadership of the drive is clearly misguided - there's that simplicity again - so astute viewers need only tick off the scenes until Clift rebels against him.Yet the film is still weirdly compelling.  Maybe it's the stirring musical score and all those vast landscapes, and the very basic pleasure of watching a movie about really tough men doing what they need to do (which sure makes a nice change of pace from the weedy Ben Stiller flicks we get today). Sadly, the whole thing comes apart in the final two minutes, when the conflict between Wayne and Clift is wrapped up in a pat and unconvincing manner thanks to the intervention of an annoying third party.  So, I can't call \"Red River\" anything better than a near miss, and I'm afraid it wasn't quite good enough to make a Western convert out of me.",

He's never been recognized to by all the actors who he influenced including Marlon Brando, Paul Newman, Al Pacino who came after him. The fact is he was persecuted for being Homosexual. It was well known and at the time, it was unforgivable. Elizabeth Taylor was a witness to this persecution on the sets of Raintree Country and other films. She has said that they treated him like trash, on and off set, and that he was pushed towards alcoholism, and drugs to deal with the persecution. It is disheartening to hear people today talk about this great talent, and not acknowledge the abuse that was inflicted on him. And he still persevered from this time '48 to about '55 when it really started to get to him, and he literally broke down. His performance in A Place in The Sun, is one of the greatest cinematic performances in Hollywood History. He deserved the Oscar he was robbed by all accounts.There is no way William Holdens performance in Stalag 17 who won was better. No credible movie critic disagrees with the fact that his performance was far superior. This performance stands against Brando's A Street Name Desired, and it was just as influential if not even more. Pacino took his acting method in the '70s for many great performances but they still cant compare to Monty's work from the late '40s to early '50s.",
