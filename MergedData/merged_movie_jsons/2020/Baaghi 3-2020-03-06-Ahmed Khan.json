            "content": "#FinalVerdictThe biggest problem with Baaghi 3 is that there's hardly any storyline in the film. Sajid Nadiadwala's adaptation is lame and it rests on a wafer-thin plot. What could've been an exhilarating thriller, with pulse-pounding moments, ends up being a run of the mill saga, courtesy a half-baked screenplay (Farhad Samji). Since Baaghi 3 goes beyond the shores of India, director Ahmed Khan and his team of writers (Sparsh Khetarpal, Tasha Bhambra, Madhur Sharma) could've used their imagination and packed the film with moments that would've made your jaws fall on your knees. Baaghi 3 is a big film in all respects - big stars, big canvas, big expenditure on VFX, big expectations. Sadly, it's a big, big, big letdown as well.The experience with Baaghi 3 is like, you enter a posh restaurant, waiting for a sumptuous meal to be served, but what's served on your plate is vada-pau. Baaghi 3 takes you back to the 1970s Bollywood, when illogical situations, blood and gore, for no rhyme or reason, were the main ingredients that made the junta break into taalis. Sorry, the formula doesn't work anymore! Seriously, what were director Ahmed Khan, Sajid Nadiadwala (story adaptation) and Farhad Samji (screenplay & dialogues) thinking when they went ahead with this apology of a script? It's perfectly okay to pay homage to the masala films of yore, but the new interpretation has to make some sense at least. The one thing that you realize after watching Baaghi 3 is, no amount of gloss, glam and top-notch stars can ever substitute for a riveting script. Great stars, great styling and great visuals work as long as the script is great.Farhad Samji's screenplay is a complete mess. In fact, if at all there would be Razzies in Bollywood, Farhad Samji should be nominated proto for coming up with a slipshod, brainless and witless screenplay. What saddens your heart is the fact that Sajid Nadiadwala and Fox Star Studios, the producers of Baaghi 3, have spared no efforts in giving the film a spectacular look. The vision is perfect, but how about narrating an absorbing and attention-grabbing story? You remember Baaghi 3 for its striking visuals, not storyline. It's like embellishing priceless and precious jewels on a mannequin. The fight becomes too Bollywoodish as the hero eliminates an entire army of terrorists, is difficult to gulp! Perhaps, director Ahmed Khan's intentions are right, to make a hard-hitting film that marries realism and fiction beautifully, but the writing indulges in too many cinematic liberties and that's precisely why Baaghi 3 goes off target.However, lovers of action fares are in for a treat, since the stunts, action and chase sequences in Baaghi 3 are truly captivating. Sure, a few sequences aren't for the faint-hearted, but you can't help but put your hands together for these sequences and the man behind those death-defying stunts. Coupled with top-notch cinematography (Santhana Krishnan Ravichandran) and stylish action (Ram Chella-Laxman Chella, Kecha Khamphakdee) the film begins to grow as reel after reel unspools. But, alas, the film goes for a toss in the second hour. Things actually stagnate as the hero turns into super-hero and combats an army of villains on land, sea and air. Director Ahmed Khan and his team of writers seem to have substituted action for content and that's the most glaring flaw. In fact, you feel that the director and screenplay writers must've decided to go on a vacation in the second hour, entrusting the responsibility on the stunt directors to conclude the second hour.Baaghi 3 is soaked in high-voltage drama and action, with a consistent undercurrent of tension. As a matter of fact, there's an overdose of action in the film, though, I must admit, a few action pieces are deftly executed. But the absence of a riveting and absorbing screenplay looms large in the post-interval portions. Sure, some sequences do hit you hard, but the writing tilts heavily towards been-there-seen-that kind of situations persistently, promising little or no surprise as the plot unravels. The background score (Julius Packiam) enhances the impact, while the dialogue (Farhad Samji) are power-packed at times, but plain mediocre at places. The film's music is awful but thankfully, there aren't too many songs.Director Ahmed Khan tries to camouflage the defect (lacklustre screenplay) with stylish execution, hair-raising stunts, eye-filling visuals, but let's not forget that the moviegoer wants to listen to a captivating story at the end of the day. Everything else is secondary! The film goes on and on and on with unwanted scenes galore (editing: Rameshwar S. Bhagat), the outdated love angle and the lenggggggthy fight sequences. Director Ahmed Khan seems to have taken the audience for granted. He has concentrated more on giving the film a slick look than narrating a gripping story and this fact reverberates at several points in the film. There's no denying that Baaghi 3 bears the stamp of an upmarket product all through, but how one wishes the director and the writers would've ensured that the film has a power-packed screenplay to offer as well.Baaghi 3 belongs to Tiger Shroff completely. No two opinions on that. Take Tiger out of this film and the movie is a big zero. He's the lifeline of this project and his performance will be loved by the masses. Shraddha Kapoor looks gorgeous and acts very well. Riteish Deshmukh is relegated to the backseat. What did Riteish see in this role? Ankita Lokhande's character lacks meat. Jackie Shroff and Vijay Varma are alright. Jaideep Ahlawat and Jameel Khoury evoke terror that one would associate with their characters. They are fantastic.To sum up, Baaghi 3 is regressive cinema with a capital R. The film has some engrossing moments in the first half, that's about it. The post-interval portions are an absolute downer. The plot is formulaic, while the screenplay is riddled with cinematic liberties. Fans of Tiger Shroff might patronize the movie; however, the aam junta might not take a liking to it. At the box-office, the film will embark on a strong start, but it doesn't have the merits to sustain after the initial curiosity subsides. Baaghi 3 fails as a film.",

            "content": "I wonder if it's because of the movie or because of the current battle against nepotism in Bollywood by the fans, if it's the latter then it's not fair.\nHowever this film surely deserved 1 star, because of the illogical action scenes, unrealistic situations, dumb dialogue, & sub par acting. The main protagonist will stop at absolutely nothing to protect that his older brother that includes fighting foreign terrorists, standing in between heavy armored helicopters only to destroy them few seconds later, not to mention the ridiculous scene with the armor tanks (why the heck did the terrorists have lots of tanks easily at their disposal like that? I doubt even the Syrian military have that lot.) I mean I love my brother and all but I doubt if I can fly off of buildings like that for him, sorry bro I'm not Tiger Shroff and I'm not friends with gravity lol.The direction, the writing, the music is nothing original. Please Bollywood try something new. Enough if this ludicrous fight scenes and the perfect main character personality. That's not how it works in reality. I can't take Riteish seriously, I mean he's now playing himself. He did the same acting in housefull 3 with his misspelling nonsense",

            "content": "Review By Kamal KFar distanced from reality, the delusional world of Baaghi 3 travels from Agra to Syria, with a rather frail story. An overly protective younger brother, Ronnie (Tiger Shroff) constantly rescues Vikram (Riteish Deshmukh), who, despite lacking essential qualities like bravado, and much to the surprise of the other characters, becomes a police official. That he becomes one after the demise of their cop-father Jackie Shroff hopes to add some credibility to this turn of events.Vikram is sent on a mission to Syria to catch hold of a dreadful terrorist, Abu Jalal. But this plot too falls flat on its face after Ronnie must travel to Syria to save his brother from unforeseen circumstances. What happens in Syria is an entirely different story, one that's devoid of logic. But we had expected that, anyway!While the plot isn't intriguing, Shroff's high-octane action sequences may hold your attention. There's no doubt that like he does in every other film, he has pulled off the stunts with as much sincerity as he has finesse. A helicopter sequence deserving a special mention for its visual appeal.If the wafer-thin plot is a disappointment, the cast doesn't particularly shine during emotional scenes either. Many, in fact, reduce viewers to laughs.Shraddha Kapoor is merely there to add comic relief, but the script fails to even validate her presence. Ankita Lokhande too has little to play with, here. A special highlight, though, is the single scene that sees father-son - both on and off screen - Jackie and Tiger, feature in one frame.Ahmed Khan has employed formulaic trinkets - good songs, and larger-than-life action - to make this 150-minute film a commercial entertainer.",

Whenever Tiger Shroff and Shraddha Kapoor shared frame, it was magical. It was like watching Meryl Streep and Daniel Day-Lewis share screen. The action - Tiger killed atleast a 1000 guys and injured some 30-40000 others. You would lose the count after a while. The dialogues, specially the comedy sequences - all I can say is the writers must be proud of their work. The direction - the likes of Nolan, Tarantino and Scorsese should hide in shame or learn from Ahmed Khan. Only in a 1000 years comes a movie experience like this. I am simply sad that I wouldn't live long enough to experience a piece of art like this again. Unless, ofcourse if Bella does me a favour and bites me.

            "content": "BAAGHI 3 REVIEW :-Baaghi in 2016, Baaghi 2 in 2018 and Baaghi 3 in 2020 this series of events took a very short time to run. Baaghi was a Hit where we saw Tiger Shroff and Shraddha Kapoor doing some excellent stunts and then came Baaghi 2 which took the action level much higher than previous. In result, Baaghi 2 emerged a Blockbuster and since then expectations for Baaghi 3 started building up. This time, Ronnie is back in action again but he is not against any single person but againt a nation. You can imagine how big they're going with this franchise. Baaghi 3 falls down under this pressure and how deep? You just can't bear it.From the trailer we got pretty much idea of film's story. Ronnie (Tiger Shroff) and Vikram (Riteish Deshmukh) are brothers who share an unbreakable bond. Since childhood, Ronnie always comes to the rescue whenever Vikram falls in any trouble. Their journey begins when a certain turn in events, leads Vikram turned a Police officer to travel in Syria to complete some work. On this trip, Vikram gets kidnapped by people who are not to be messed with but as Ronnie witnesses his brother getting beaten and kidnapped by ISIS, he knows that he will do whatever it takes to destroy anyone and anything that stands in the way of Vikram's safety. Ronnie goes on a rampage of destruction to see his brother safe again, even if it means that he independently has to take on villain Abu Jindal or so called an entire country.When it comes to action films, Tiger Shroff seems like an unstoppable force. I loved him in Heropanti, Baaghi, Baaghi 2, War and now Baaghi 3 all these films have surely made him a darling of masses. He is the only action superstar among young brigade in Bollywood. What i didn't like about him is he fel less in acting everytime. His dialogue delivery in this film is at least tolerable but his expressions are totally dull. Shraddha Kapoor looks cute and but unbearably funny. there is lot of dubbing made on her dialogues and that made her look like a b grade actress. I remember watching her performance and stunts in Baaghi and i absolutely loved her but this time it is completely opposite. Riteish Deshmukh as Vikram is innocent from the start but you have a special surprise at the end, watch out for that (if you can't predict muvh like a movie buff). His wife Ruchi is played by gorgeous Ankita Lokhande and she is hardly decent. Rest of the cast is okay with thier particular cameos and supporting roles.\nBollywood has a massive fanbase for Action films. If there's any film seen, which shows you something bigger, larger in action genre then people would love it. In Baaghi 3 you get to see Ronnie alone smashing entire team of terrorism gang, this is something big but what about the content? Baaghi 3 falters in linear equation of storytelling. There are so many loopholes and loo breaks while setting a plot. Once you start hating them ypu just wanna go home leaving the film unfinished. Dialogues are massy flavoured, comically taunted. Music viz there are couple of songs that will keep you engaged but you know more of Tiger's dancing would have been more pleasing.\nAhmed Khan comes tries to make an entertainer set in emotional liberty supported by explosive action. But sadly Action director does a better job than him. It's quite irregular from his style of films and i don't know why he chose to go such kiddish way when he could have easily made a good entertainer like it's predecessor. He tries to focus more on emotions than hardcore drama where he wins couple of times but fails on more occasions. Overall, Baaghi 3 doesn't live upto the mark at all, i instead it degrades the standard of action franchise set by previous two films. I can blame director for the failure as he has totally destroyed this emerging franchise. If you love action then watch it, if you have seen enough action in trailer then better skip it.RATING- 4/10*",

Signing these crap films clearly reflects that Tiger is far from being an Actor. All his movies are these craps which he carries on his shoulders by Action and Action only. Don't know what on earth is Shraddha doing in the film. She was trying hard to be funny using some cuss words but everything looked irritating after a point. She went with Ronnie to Syria to dance, run and do some action exactly what and when Ronnie is doing the same. Disha Patani's item song in a Syrian Bar is a filth but gives us a little comfort from the mindless action going around. A Bomb blasts near Ronnie's legs but nothing happens to him, infact he gets thrust to jump upto the helicopter. Ritesh Deshmukh is a police officer with no characteristics of the same. Direction, Storyline, Songs, Humor nothing is convincing at all. Only a Single star for Tiger trying to do his level best and carry the film all by himself.

Wouldn't the crew and cast laugh when watching a preview of this absurdity? In case anyone is still interested about the plot- Tiger Shroff is a one man Army who travels to Syria (which is filmed in Serbia by the way) to rescue his brother (Riteish Drshmukh). Think of the most unimaginable fight sequences and you will see them in the movie. The movie is so bad, it will remind some viewers of the pathetic action movies of Mithun Da from the 90's. \"Baaghi 3\" is just a glorified version of one of those trash house movies.

It's a Tamil film and a Tamil word 'vettai' and you bought the rights and yet credited it as Telugu film 'vettai'... It's clear that 'copy karna aati nahi aur chutiyapan to jaati nahi' . on a scale a 10 where 10 is the stupidest someone can be, the director scores 85 million INR.. my heart goes out to the poor kid tiger Shroff who dint deserve to do this ducked up movie.",

To help him in this mission he has Shraddha Kapoor. The film is full of action with fights and explosions galore every minute. It is\" \"maar dhad unlimited\". Most of it is highly exaggerated with no considerations for the laws of physics. A few sequences are downright ridiculous. There are many sequences of Tiger running towards camera with full blown explosions in the background. The film is targeted towards diehard fans of Tiger Shroff, and they will not be disappointed. Others like me will find Tiger lacking in the acting department. Other members of audience may find it difficult to sit through this overdose of mindless violence, and a wafer thin script. In one action scene there is countdown of 45 seconds on display as Tiger bashes up the goons ! Of course Tiger wins hand down.\nDirector Ahmed Khan unabashedly gives you an upfront overdose of unadulterated action . He has definitely put in huge amount of effort and the logistics seem to be quite complex. Some good cinematography and special effects are seen. The narrative is confusing made worse with banal dialogue. However the film provides full on entertainment provided you don't ask questions.",

Meet Ronnie - the handsome hunk whose only job is to magically appear from thin air whenever his elder brother Vikram is in trouble. He will bash up the bad guys to a pulp and go back to minding his own business. But in a sudden twist, Vikram is kidnapped by a terrorist group called Jaish-e-Lashkar in Syria and Ronnie sets off on a rescue mission. Director Ahmed Khan throws in every trick in the book to make 'Baaghi 3' an action entertainer with elements that highlight his leading man's brute force and deadly machismo. Tiger Shroff, who is clearly one of Bollywood's most bankable action stars, packs quite a punch in the high-octane action scenes (directed by Ram-Laxman and Kecha Khampadkee). His perfect body and attitude make all the stylized action look real. However, he falls short in emotional scenes and comedy. Shraddha Kapoor looks beautiful and brings in some good comic relief in the first half. But her character isn't very crucial to the story and hence, she doesn't have much scope to perform. Riteish Deshmukh has an important role, but his character suffers from a certain handicap, which is never explained. On one hand, he needs to be constantly protected by his younger brother but on the other, he is also recruited as a police officer despite being so vulnerable. Such inconsistency in his character graph makes it difficult to relate with him. In fact, there are quite a few such loose ends in the story that make it far less convincing.\nWhile the Syrian setting brings in a terrifying feel, most villains are far too caricaturish to be taken seriously, barring the main villain Abu Jalal (Jameel Khoury). He looks the part and his performance is chilling. Among the other actors, Jackie Shroff, Ankita Lokhande and Vijay Varma lend good support. The dialogues by Farhad Samji are laced with low-brow humour, especially in the first half and fairly filmy in the second half. The film's music is quite average but thankfully, there aren't too many songs. Disha Patani sizzles in a scintillating item number that adds a dash of glamour to this stylish actioner. While the action design (by Ahmed Khan) is impressive, the same cannot be said for the shaky camerawork and weak CGI.",

            "content": "These ridiculously low ratings are indeed very surprising. It's become very common these days to bash a Bollywood action film whether it's good or bad. As for Baaghi 3, it is meant to please action fans. With its crowd-pleasing stunts, explosions and fight sequences dominating the core while also delivering an emotionally resonant, occasionally funny and tension-filled story, Baaghi 3 succeeds in hitting the target. If you don't like action movies, don't watch it just to criticize it.Baaghi 3 delivers on action and that is the best thing about the film. Honestly, why would one go to this film expecting some sophisticated and complex storytelling? It's all about Tiger Shroff fighting bad guys, blowing up stuff and performing daredevil stunts: and that's exactly what I paid for. I agree the story in the second half is basically another version of Taken or Man on Fire, but there's enough style and substance to keep one engaged till the last moment.And substance is a subjective term. It doesn't just apply to critically acclaimed/award-winning dramas but to any film that stays true to its genre. Baaghi 3 does that, and in case you still don't realize that, it's an ACTION FILM. It also has some surprisingly solid performances coming from Tiger and Riteish, especially in the climax. The camerawork is good during the action scenes. One might feel certain things in the first half are simply rushed to bring the film to its actual storyline, but the overall handling is good enough to ignore this flaw after a point of time.All in all, Baaghi 3 is for you if you're a fan of action movies and Tiger Shroff/Riteish Deshmukh. If not, this one's simply not for you. As for me, I totally enjoyed the film till the last moment and I'm saying this having seen countless number of action films from the world that often have the same \"hero-rescues-loved-one\" template used again and again.",

'Log rishto mein hadein paar karte hain, mera ek aisa rishta tha, jiske liye maine sarhadein paar kardi (People cross limits for their relationships, I had one such relationship for which I crossed borders)' this line was enough for me to get interested in the movie. I watched it with my family and we had a great time.Riteish and Tiger are brothers. Whenever Riteish gets in trouble Tiger always helps him. After Riteish becomes a police officer Tiger helps him to clean up the criminals while Riteish gets the credit. This attention from both media and other officers brings the brothers face to face with a Terrorist.Jackie Shroff had little screen time, he did an excellent job with those odd few minutes. The supporting cast did an excellent job. Tiger has done his best acting yet on this one. He showed bigger screen presence and seemed more comfortable in his role. He has come a long way in terms of acting. I liked the chemistry between Tiger and Riteish. They looked very cute and loveable.The dialogues are surprisingly catchy. Songs are catchy as well. I loved the get ready to fight reloaded. This is the best version of get ready to fight yet.The Action is the biggest positive of Baaghi 3. I loved Baaghi 2 for the action scenes but my god they took it to the next level in Baaghi 3. The first fight outside a Cineplex was superb and they topped it in the next fight at IPL's lair. Very few movies this year from Bollywood can compete with Baaghi 3 in terms of action. The fist fights in the first half was out of this world. The last fight scene does drag but even that had its moments.There is not much in terms of story but the action scenes make up for that. I loved the first half. Thanks to excellent cinematography Baaghi 3 is very pleasing to the eye. Recommended if you liked Baaghi 2.",

Baaghi 1 was fantastic and 2 was really good, but this one is not even near to anywhere. This one got diverted entirely, not even acting was in place of anyone. This is one such movie, where i couldn't watch Shraddha on screen. Felt like more of a comedy-action genre. Only two things to like here for, one is the Tiger's action effort and other one is the double quotes from Jaideep. Rest all a major let down. Nothing to voice out in terms of goodness. This wasn't expected. I would rather watch the Telugu version once again. Normally, i have watched Baaghi 1 and 2 couple of times due to many interesting reasons including the powerful BGM, those previous installemnts are definitely not a one time watch, but this one easily came out of mind after watching.",

This movie is a perfect example of this, even the action scenes aren't synchronised properly. I have given one star for Tiger's acting apart from it I will give negative ratings.

Shroff lad need to really look at his acting skills, his scripts- he looks like a clown now who is always doing same things again and again. Even his jumping look old and stale. And why is he always shirtless?? We all know kid has abs, but who cares to watch his abs all the time.

I live in NYC and wait for movies like these , movies that are entertaining on all counts. I'm not interested in psuedo Hindi movies where only the language is Hindi but the acting , direction and treatment of the film is a \"wannabe \" Hollywood. This movie is great on all counts. The acting is just fine for the genre, the script is pretty tight , direction is seamless , there are no slow or boring moments in the movie. And what do I say about the Action! It is just WOW! Tiger Shroff is something else! Right now there is nobody like him in any film industry anywhere. Thanks to Netflix and Prime, I watch movies of different languages nearly every night and I can tell you there is nobody like Tiger, anywhere. I'm so proud we have an action hero like him. There were 3 songs and all three were really good. This is an audio visual treat for your senses. I took my 2 boys for the movie and all of us thoroughly enjoyed the movie.\nI dont know why people are so negative towards these movies. If you dont like something maybe it's your taste , the product doesnt become bad. I being an Indian hate mangoes, doesnt mean mangoes are bad. A Hollywood movie of the same caliber would get such great praises but if we do it and do it better , we will be torn to shreds with analysis\nFOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE ACTION, YOU CANT MISS THIS ONE!!!!",

If you watch moive like james bond or mission impossible you never say it is worst movie because they are hollywood. Please don't compare bollywood to any wood.

            "content": "Honestly speaking i became fan of Shraddha Kapoor and Tiger Shroff when i i first watch Baaghi in 2016. I was literally waiting to watch both of them together again. Then there came 2018 Baaghi 2 little bit of dissapointment when i get to know that shradha Kapoor has been replaced by Disha Patani. But the movie was good allover. But when I get back to know that shradha kapoor is again coming back in the Baaghi 3 and even Riteish Deshmukh, i was eagerly waiting for it to come. And now i just watched the movie in Disney Hotstar.Can't believe they can make such movie in this era. The story line is overdramatic, far from the reality, we can't even say it a fictional, its far from fictional. It is one of the worst film the industry have ever made. Only Riteish Deshmukh and Jackie Shroff was good. I have a better storyline than this movie....seriously speaking. And why the hell Grandson is recruiting Ahmed Khan for direction. We have seen his direction. He can't be in comparision to Sabbir Khan. The first part was made by Sabbir Khan and he have done it very well.A single movie destroyed the whole franchisee. Tiger Shroff had been shown not less than a superhuman. After watching this, definitely Nick Fury is going to call him for MARVEL PHASE 5. I can't give you here the complete details but you must get understand till now how much good this movie is.....Seriously i am still in shocked and honestly speaking i have never seen such type of movie ever in my life. The Bollywood industry must work on their storywriting and must not give direction to the hands of any choreographer or else it will be soon on the hands of a doom.....A message to The Grandson, please take as much time as you want but dont ruin the Kick franchisee as Baaghi and please bring Sabbir Khan with a nice storyline for Baaghi 4. We are waiting for it......",

Shraddha Kapoor and Ankita lokhande were alright however Their exchanges were exceptionally awful . Riteish Deshmukh has worked superbly yet same as his exchanges were so cringy.\nStoryline ought to be all the more better.

Just like some soppy '80s Bollywood potboiler, their dad on his death bed makes a young Ronnie swear that he will always protect Vikram with all his might. The seeds of unnatural co-dependence is sown and Ronnie turns indestructible saviour to his sibling. Vikram, who becomes a cop as his dad was in the force (nepotism anyone?), becomes a celebrated police officer because his muscled-brother helps him catch all the scruffy bad guys in his Agra locality. Stakes become big when he goes on an assignment to Syria and gets kidnapped by a militant group that rules Syria. All hell breaks loose and the movie descend into a creative purgatory.",

The witty dialogues were gone and Tiger's once jolly facial expression was replaced by a constant need to hold a constipated, intense stare.The action was bad. Tiger is a genuinely respected martial artist but the overdependence on illogical 'Bollywood Fu' in this movie was embarrassing. When a comedy actor like Ritesh Deshmukh outperforms the hero of the movie with better acting and facial expressions, you know you have wasted your money.Having said all that this a shudh bollywood action movie and doesn't contain any sex topics like in certain bollywood movies now a days.

Each and everything you always compare and when a movie which has a Hollywood touch, then you guys are trolling that. The lead actor is illogical, and movies have no physics and all? Do all the action movies of Hollywood also have logic? Can a Person like John Wick kill 1000 people alone? No, all that is only possible in movies. and that was the movie is. It's for entertainment and Baaghi 3 has done a great job in that. I have watched it today even after this much of negative reviews. But you guys ever notice, how people praise such talent in Hollywood? By giving good comments. Not like you, the movie is not that bad to get an average of 1.8/10 You are the people of India who is making this even worse. People praise the movie efforts here in Hollywood but you people are just demotivating the movie actors, directors, producers and their mind blowing extraordinary work. If anybody is reading this review of mine, then please watch the movie. It's really a great One time Entertainer. Not that much which is marked here on IMDB. If people like me from my country, from Hollywood, will come and rate this movie, it will be somewhere around 7/10. Stop blaming your country's production guys. We guys have ruled over you because you made this possible. And you are really torturing your Bollywood and your India. Good luck!",
