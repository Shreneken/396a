Scenes are scattered and disconnected, with random parallel stories which do not deliver anything extra to the film. They just tire the viewer.\nThe violence... is only used to provide \"action\" to the slow-burn and dull storyline.\nThe story itself... the idea is not bad, the delivery and the stretch of the idea to make it a 2,5 hour long movie; yes that's very bad.\nActing...here it is actually 50/50. Some moments are rewarding but not enough to save this film.\nOverall, I m rather upset that someone spent all this money to create such a time-consuming, violent and pointless movie. 2/10 , don't waste your time.",

            "review_title": "Way Too Long and Way Too Conventional",
            "content": "Netflix has blessed (or \"blessed\") us with yet another crime blockbuster, this time one directed by Olivier Megaton (\"Transporter 3\", \"Taken 2\", \"Colombiana\"), who's no stranger to action movies. The critical acclaim has never been real high for him, and, sadly, \"The Last Days of American Crime\" is within the same ballpark as all his movies before. Personally, this is my least favorite chapter in his filmography.In a not-too-distant future, as they put it, U.S. government is a week away from activating a signal that will make it impossible for people to go against the law, any and all law. It will do so via brain rape, just try lifting a gun or shoplifting a snickers and you'll freeze and shake uncontrollably. You probably can hear the sarcasm and irony already, so yes, I did not enjoy this movie a lot. Besides that particular interesting and far-fetched idea, it's a highly conventional and thoroughly mildly frustrating crime flick romp, featuring plot and characters based off ancient blueprints. Some characters are no more than a mere sketch, like the one given to the guy I was excited to see the most, Sharlto Copley. His storyline went down the mill and down the hill. First half an hour is mostly pure and simple exposition, and the action doesn't even change gears until 70 minutes into already. There's all the usual romance and subplots, all of which end up just about where You expect them. The melodrama at play here really ticks all the most typical and overused boxes. Movie's real enemy, though, is its runtime. It is way too long for its own good, way too long and featuring way too little, clocking in at 2 hours and 20 minutes & that's not counting titles. A story of this depth and this quality usually deserves maybe a 100 minutes, maybe, and even then it still is what it is. At the very least, I was expecting a good heist factor. Everything leads up to it, only for me to understand that it's the wackiest, most unexciting heist movie ever. Frankly, the heist plot and even the crime-stopping-signal plot matter very little in the big picture of \"The Last Days of American Crime\". They say the graphic novel this movie's based on, is great and all. I don't know about that, but the adaptation certainly isn't great.The Positives? Acting. No award material on the horizon, but decent portrayals of dry characters, with the highlight probably being Anna Brewster and Michael Pitt, though Pitt's character is not easy to like. Next positive would be big budget. Movie looks arguably good, though still, by all means, it's undoubtedly an uninspired blockbuster. Crisp, contrastive cinematography, sometimes overkilled in editing, we also got explosions, raging guns, crashes and whatnot. The typical drivel, it just happens to be well made here. And original score, soundtrack - also decent. For a big part, the movie is pretty macho, many male characters are like that, boys, and if there's one truth in this world, it's that boys will be boys. The original score, being rocky and bluesy, went hand in hand with that. As for the soundtrack, it reminded of \"Sucide Squad\", because it had good songs, but no good reason to use them whatsoever. \"The Last Days of American Crime\" ended with Depeche Mode's \"Personal Jesus\" - kind of a waste on a two-bit clich\u00e9 ending like this one.It's a movie of no originality, but it's not exactly bad at being a well made conventional crime thriller, I mean as conventional as it gets, despite its sci-fi-ish backdrop. It shoots itself in all the rest proverbial knees by making itself a 2 and a half hour experience, major mistake there. Regardless of the runtime, but even more because of it, I don't recommend watching this brick of a movie. My rating: 5/10.",

You same folks gave \"The Old Guard\", another Netflix project, a 6.6 rating, and that one is no better or no worse than this one. Not that you can't pick out the flaws, but for action/adventure fans, there's a lot of explosions and bloodshed to go around here. That's not actually what I come to a picture like this for, but you sort of have to go with the flow.So the working premise is that the government will soon implement what's called an API signal that will inhibit the criminal mind from committing unlawful acts. When the switch is thrown, all police authority in the country becomes moot, and the FBI remains in sole charge of maintaining law and order, such as it will be. As the date draws near, the window of opportunity for outlaws, and specifically the protagonists in this story, narrows for executing one last heist. Graham Bricke (Edgar Ram\u00edrez) is sought out by a crime kingpin's estranged son (Michael Pitt) via his sexy girlfriend (Anna Brewster), to join a convoluted scheme to rob a billion dollars in old and new money before the API signal is implemented.Granted, this film didn't require two and a half hours in the telling, but how else would Bricke, Kevin Cash (Pitt), and Shelby Dupree (Brewster) get into and out of so many impossible situations. Even a couple of FBI guys on the take have a hand in the story, making it possible for Shelby to rescue her sister from some situation that isn't made clear. With the clock running down, there are enough double crosses to go around in order to leave one last man standing. Well, make that one last woman standing.That API signal by the way, was described earlier by Kevin Cash, who said it was a molecular modulation of the pre-frontal cortex, which sounded to me a little like a lobotomy. Which reminded me of a line from one of my old time comic books about an interplanetary assassin named Nexus, who once said \"I'd rather have a free bottle in front of me than a pre-frontal lobotomy\". And as for the basic plot of the story, I do have a major reservation about the government implementing a program to void criminal behavior. I mean, how would Congress ever come up with a majority of it's members to ban what comes naturally.",

I hadn't heard of a premise like this before, so I was really interested to see how it would be depicted. But believe it or not, the movie doesn't really explore the implications and consequences of what would happen if such an anti-crime system was put into place. It wouldn't take much of a rewrite to make the story into a full caper movie, which is mostly as it is now. It's possible the movie might be able to be salvaged with the planning and execution of the caper, but there really isn't anything new with this portion of the movie. It just goes through the same tired elements such as double-crossing partners, corrupt law officers, etc. etc. Even when the movie tries to throw in some action, it still goes through the motions instead of being original and special. And as others here at the IMDb have pointed out, at two hours and twenty-eight minutes in length, the movie is far too long for its own good. All I can say that's positive about this movie is that it doesn't depict my country (Canada) with any real stereotypes when there are Canadian references.

Maybe it was the 0 rotten score or 3.6 rating that made me have such a low expectation, but I was entertained.I will say a lot of what people say is pretty accurate. The acting wasn't awful, but it wasn't always good. The story was a bit all over the place and some characters that you thought would have a bigger impact, didn't. The chemistry between actors were poor with only glimpses of what could have been. The movie also takes itself too serious. A little more tongue and cheek type of fun would have made some of this easier to watch.For what I thought was good, the action was alright. It reminded me of action from the 80's. A lot of people holding guns that can't aim, but still thought it was fun. It's kind of the same with the car chases and explosions, all over the top fun. Finally, I hated the villains in the movie, hated them. Why is this good? Because that means I couldn't wait to see them pay for being so annoying. Not saying they do, just saying they made me annoyed enough to make me mad. I always give credit to actors who bring out real emotion, and the real villains of the movie did that.All in all, its a wasted opportunity. I love the template of the story. Unfortunately, it wasn't executed well. I think the 3.6 and zero rotten score is not fair, but than again its a matter of opinion. It personally caught my attention enough that I was curious what would happen at the end.",

But conspiracy theories aside, the movie makes overall sense with trying to minimize crime. I am not famliar with the graphic novel this is based on, so I can't compare those things for you though.The beginning kind of sets the mood. This is over the top. Still as over the top as that seems, there is a scene that is odd to say the least. Actually being shot close range, should be the end of the discussion. But it is not - this is something that may break the movie for you. It is quite ridiculous to say the least, but it is what it is. Technically the movie works, the actors do their best for the kind of schlock it is they are in. Overall this is more than decent - it may be a bit too long, but other than that: good set pieces, great action and stunts and a decent story to hold it all together",

It is a well made film based on a graphic novel that is in a style of classic American crime and action films with a dystopia police state future. It reminds me of films like Shoot 'Em Up, Crank, Death Race, and Children of Men. It is great to see studios putting effort and budget into adapting non family friendly graphic novels.People really need to realize that giving such harsh reviews unnecessarily to films adapted from graphic novels will only discourage studios from adapting more comic books/graphic novels into film.Aside from a few slow moments in the film it is actually a decent crime action film that's well shot, well acted, and you can tell they took it seriously. Also Michael Pitt was great in this film and feel he was the stand out actor in his role.I've read a lot of negative reviews based on police brutality and riots being in the film which is the dumbest excuse to give a film negative reviews. So you're telling me that the people who started making this film years ago were trying to make a film that was what, mocking our current state of the country?! Good movie, don't over think things and just enjoy a cheasy action movie.",

Lousy shooting scenes, where hundreds of bullets are wasted against intact windshields and car doors. Edgar Ramirez reminds me a bit Oliver Reed in his forever suffering man. A nihilistic film which the end saves the whole thing. A donwbeat ending that prevented this feature to be released in theaters. so, once more, thanks Netflix.",

The action sequences were in plenty and really well executed. But while I found the first half stretched, the second felt soulless for some reason. It fails to justify its overlong duration, but works for the most part.The Last Days of American Crime is no masterpiece. Especially given how it wastes Sharlto Copley and is needlessly dragged for 149 minutes. A film like this could've been easily an hour shorter like other straight-to-video, low-budget but gripping action movies. This is where the film falters. It's way too long for its own sake. The concept of eradicating crime is really impressive, and it seems to go well for the first two acts. However, the third act is where it spirals out of control. The last 30 minutes, though action-packed, feel exhausting, given how the story was already slow in the beginning. I couldn't feel anything by the time it ended.Nevertheless, the action is what saves the movie. Yes, it does. At least for action buffs like me, who were watching it for action. Olivier Megaton did a good job with the explosions, crashes and guns. And given that it fills most of the duration is why I liked it. It's not the best or worst action movie you'll see. It's just a decent one. Expect nothing but good action and that's all it has to offer. The lack of urgency or interest in characters is kinda off-putting. But if you can ignore that just for the sake of lots of action, you'll have a pretty decent time watching it.The Last Days of American Crime is a watchable action movie. Worth watching once, if you like the genre. Rest others can skip it.",

Where law enforcement are planning to use a signal to stop people from committing crimes. That is where Brick (Edgar Ramirez) comes in. When he discovers his brother is dead in prison. He plans to get revenge by one last crime by robbing a money vault. With the help from Kelvin (Michael Pitt) and Shelby (Anna Brewster).The plot is boring. There is a twist with a character. The characters are forgettable and uninteresting. Brick is a guy who wants to get revenge for his brother. Kelvin is a want to be gangster who wants to commit a big crime to impress his father. And Shelby who is Kelvins love interest has her own personal agenda. While, officer William (Sharlto Copley) had a rough past as a cop. Sharlto Copley's character is very undeveloped.The film does have a decent amount of action to make this entertaining or its flashy direction. The film is over long for its running time. The first half was entertaining. When the heist is happening. It all comes crashing down a little too fast. Which makes it hard to keep interest in the movie.Overall, it was a pretty bad movie. The acting is dull. The characters are boring. The story and concept is messy and tedious.",

It should have been called \"That'll do\" because that's the general feeling this film gives off.. Like it was all made with a \"that'll do\" attitude. Netflix has lowered the bar on this one...\nThe real crime is the running time... Maybe that's why the movie sucks so bad because everyone behind the cameras were asleep!In short...

            "content": "This film to me proves probably more than any other that you can't trust most IMDB reviews or score for Netflix titles. For some reason, a lot of people just have it out for them, I think. That's the only way I can think to explain such a rash of incredibly low scores and dismissive, useless non-reviews. You've got a ton of people just saying this is \"boring\", with no qualification, one person even saying it looks like something Tommy Wiseau would make. Seriously? Such gross hyperbole. It's really infantile.Now I'm not saying this is a masterpiece or anything. The writing has some issues. The narration (which is most just at very beginning and somewhat quickly disappears) is pretty bad, and had me thinking of the narration in Southland Tales (not a good point of comparison for any film). The protagonist is not particularly well developed, I feel. It would be one thing if he were either portrayed as being sympathetic or more of an anti-hero, but we're not really given enough of either to make him seem compelling. He's just a little flat, and I'm not sure whether to attribute it to Ramirez' performance or just the way the character is written. That said, I thought some of the other characters were entertaining, particularly Kevin (Michael Pitt), who kind of stole all the scenes he was in.The biggest complaint I've seen of the film (although, again, few seem to actually want to talk about it like a grown-up) is that it's \"boring.\" The film is a bit long (around 2.5 hours), and yes, it is a lot of set-up for the payoff. But that isn't to say nothing happens during the set-up. There are several sub-plots that are important, and I think anyone just dismissing the film as \"boring\" is probably saying more about their lack of attention span than the film itself. If you're looking for a simple straight-up crime caper, this is probably not the film for you. This film has an interesting premise and some good world-building that necessarily takes a little time to establish. As iffy as the writing sometimes is (especially the dialog), overall this really is a somewhat involved story, which is one of the film's best aspects.Criticism that the film is poorly made (see above comment re: Wiseau) is amusing at best. Again, while I wouldn't say this is masterfully directed, it's at the very least competent. The action is usually compelling, and there are a lot of scenes that have a good build-up of suspense. I never felt like I was watching something amateurish. This more than anything kind of makes me wonder what the agenda is of the massive amount of people saying such things about the film. What is their point of comparison? It seems more likely that there is some reason external to the film for them to be targeting it. But that's all conjecture, and ultimately irrelevant. All I can is that I strongly disagree and urge people to give this a shot and decide for themselves. Don't be dissuaded by the nay-sayers and the ridiculously low score (currently 3.6, which is laughable). I'd say this is easily in the 5-7 range, probably somewhere in the middle. I'm tempted to give it an 8 or higher just to offset some of the obvious troll votes, but I am going to give it a 7 which is the high end of what I think is reasonable and accurate to my experience.",

The story focuses on career criminal Graham Bricke (\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez) as he struggles to get back in the game since the death of his brother Rory (Daniel Fox) in a robbery. Seeking revenge against those responsible for his brother's loss he teams up with fellow criminals Kevin Cash (Michael Pitt) and Shelby Dupree (Anna Brewster) to plan a huge heist, racing against the clock before a mysterious government-made signal threatens to put a stop to all crime for good. The movie was panned by critics who took exception to its violent content and depictions of police brutality in light of the George Floyd protests (during one brutal fight scene a police officer is shown choking someone). Sure, it has it's flaws, but it isn't as bad as the reviews make it out to be, despite the fact it tries too hard to be something it's not, and leaves viewers wondering about the central message.

Instead, this misfire went to making him and his cohorts appear just as unlikable and cutthroat as their contenders. Although if enough patience is given, the story sort of grows on you.

When it takes effect, police will cease its operations and instead some guy in DC will monitor things. There are protests everywhere and people are fleeing or trying to flee to Canada.Some guy named Bricke takes his time to set some other guy on fire. There's some talk about Bricke's brother who was in jail and died there. Then he hooks up with a pretty girl in bar. Turns out pretty girl is Cash's girl. It's Cash who now approached Bricke with a proposal after telling him the the truth about how his brother died in jail. The idea is to rob billions from the local Federal Reserve just as API launches. Of course they will have to hack into it to give them a couple of minutes to escape. So we spend some days with these goofs as they live their ugly and violent lives. Cash is the estranged son of a mob family. They need some explosives from dad. So they visit him and some pointless violence ensues to get their hands on the explosives.Bricke brings in some sidekick of his as health insurance. Pretty girl has a deal with the FBI because she has a sister and the FBI is taking her to Canada before API. Bricke has some more violent run-ins with the guy he set on fire in the intro and with the mob captains.At last, half an hour before the movie is over, the heist begins. Things go nearly as planned but with plenty of bloody violence in between. Of course there is unnecessary and unlikely romance between pretty girl and Bricke.So unfortunately, this movie is as bad as the rating here suggests. The concept is good, there are some ideas and good lines here and there, but it just doesn't work. The movie is too long, too ugly, too unnecessarily violent--and I'm not one to shy away from violent movies, but this is the definition of gratuitous violence. They try to give us some pointless background about a cop who will later confront pretty girl. Among all these nasty characters, who do you root for? No one. Pretty girl is a secondary character but you do end up rooting for her for a lack of a good lead character. Bricke doesn't say much of anything throughout the movie so who cares about him. Cash is more likeable but the over the top acting doesn't help. This movie then stumbles and drags aimlessly along for two hours instead of giving us some cool heist planning. The heist itself is of course alright, not even Megaton! Can botch a heist entirely. But there's no way around that Megaton! Can't direct his way out of a paperbag, at least not without Brisson holding his hand. Here they gave him the budget, the cast, the ideas and he still can't deliver. I assume the script isn't too bad because Gajdusek is fairly competent. The editor, a Megaton! Associate, on the other hand isn't. Had they trimmed this thing by an hour and toned down the silliness and the ugliness they could have had a good sci-fi action flick. Three stars for Anna Brewster, the lovely nudity, and some smart ideas.",

            "content": "This film hit Netflix today and I have had the chance to watch The Last Days Of American Crime and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a crew attempt to commit a heist just before a signal comes in to play to stop anybody from commiting a major crime.Main Character\nEdgar Ramirez plays the main character here and honestly I have never been a big fan of his, I just find him really boring to watch and this film is no different as he is such a boring lead character. There is nothing unique about him at all as a lead character and the film gives you no reason to care about him or why he is doing what he is doing so it leads you to become bored by him.Supporting Characters\nThe great Sharlto Copley is in this film and when he is on the screen he is clearly the best actor here, I just don't really understand why he was here. His character plays no part in the plot really and it feels like a weird excuse to pad out the length by putting him in here. Anna Brewster plays Ramirez's love interest here and I mean she has the best motivations here, but they still don't work and I didn't care about their romance. There was just nothing there and no chemistry between the two performers to make it interesting or compelling. Michael Pitt plays there associate and he is that character who is just insane for being insane's sake, he has family issues but none of it is expanded enough for you to care and you really wonder why Ramirez's character even decides to work with him as it makes no sense.Story\nThe premise of the film is pretty interesting but it is just executed so poorly, you don't care about the characters and the heist doesn't get the attention that it deserves so you aren't exactly clear why and what they are planning to do. There is a side plot with the police that isn't expanded at all and it feels like it is there for no real reason at all. The end of the film is crazy and tries to make you care about the characters but you just don't.Script\nThe script is really boring here, the drama didn't connect with me or make me care about anything and there is literally no real humour making this a very sombre and frustrating experience.Style\nThe style of the film has some decent action scenes that are really over the top making them fun experiences, it is just there aren't enough of them. Plus the film is 2 and a half hours which is absurd, it drags on to a slow painful death, the film should have known what it was and aimed for 2 hours or even a little less instead of dragging on with one of the slowest paced movies you will see all year.Overall\nOverall, this is a really poor film, so boring and so slow. It just about avoids a 1 rating because of some fun action scenes and Sharlto Copley but it was close because I was so bored watching this film and recommend nobody waste over 2 hours of there day with it.Rating - 2/10.",

All the same here we go. Oh and I will not give anything away from the film.First off it starts well. It still has that element of comic book to it. So that's a good start. The cast is......... ok. Anna Brewster who plays Shelby Dupree for me did steel the film. Every scene she is in she showed that she could do much better things. The rest of the cast I am sorry to say just could not match up to her. Was that down to their acting or the writing of the film? Not too sure.The story just did not flow that well. It kind of stop started a lot. I feel if more time was put in to it then it would have run better.So I guess it comes down to why I gave it 8 out of 10. A big part has to go to Anna Brewster. I can not wait to see what she does next. Another part is when time was taken on action scenes it was done well. It is mostly the parts in between. Is it a possible cult film? No. It will not win any critics around as well. For me I sat down having read so many bad reviews and found it was not that bad! I will watch it again at some point but in the mean time it was interesting film. Well done Miss Brewster.",

It's like all anyone watches is the news so we can get bits of information here and there. The movie is well over two hours for Christ's sake. Not sure if the science is truly ever explained or if we're just supposed to accept that the government has the capability to stop all crime. Very little character development. I could barely hear the actors dialogue, but the action sequences were extremely loud.

It is about the last days where crime is possible in America. About people who make a living out of crime and who are trying to protect their livelihood before their possibilities get taken away by society. The title says it all really. No more story is needed.

I admit I did not quite follow all the ins-and-outs of the heist, but that didn't really matter. Neither did the occasional plot holes or inconstancies. They obviously went for a very gritty, bloody action film and it certainly is that.\nI was expecting the idea of the 'API', a transmission that affects the mind to prevent law-breaking to just be a McGuffin, but it turned out much more interesting than that. There are shades of 'Clockwork Orange' in some of the ramifications. And there's plenty in this film about the power and motivations of government agencies, which have a lot of resonance right now.

I feel like this movie got a green light based on the title and a one page pitch...and then the writer ran out of ideas. A story about the last possible crimes before a neurological device stops the entire country from acting on criminal impulses is a GREAT premise! How did this device get distributed? Who stands to gain from the end of crime? Why does Michael Pitt's character have such a jacked up relationship with his family? If people are going to murder their immediate family, the audience needs to know WHY. There are so many questions that go unanswered in this movie. In fact, there is not ONE plot device that makes sense. There is not ONE storyline that satisfies. There is not ONE character worth caring about.I'm offended that this movie was even made, it has the production value of a decent budget, yet it seems to have been written and directed by unimaginative middle schoolers. Middle schoolers with a VERY RICH PARENT.If you're old enough to remember Pia Zadora's \"Butterfly,\" this movie is worse than that! Butterfly was a vanity project starring the talentless Zadora and financed by her crazy-rich, super-old husband. It featured father/daughter incest Story treated with inexplicably romantic gauze-over-the-lens soft focus. Until this, it was the worst movie I've ever seen. I'd watch that tripe again to avoid seeing this again.....So I have a couple of questions for the producers of this film. 1) Where did the money come from? 2) HOW did you get the very talented Michael Pitt to sell his soul for this dreck? Is he deep in debt? Was he blackmailed? 3) Why is it that in an industry where so many super talented women and minority writers and directors are struggling to get a break, this Megaton hack is still able to get financing? Please let this be his last picture. In addition to some of the worst directing this side of \"Showgirls,\" this director had the audacity to clock this trash in at 2.5 hours! Grotesquely self indulgent.Yeah, no. Don't see this movie. Not even for fun.",

Just a revamp of typical action movie with a nostalgic Escape from NY flavor. Most of the supporting actors/actresses were pretty good. Brewster in particular. She almost made a really horribly written role shine. If you believed anything in the movie it was her. The premise is kind of goofy, the plot is also, but not so over the top as to be inane like so many action movies are today. Ramirez was just so wooden with his lines. It was like they cast a voice mail prompt for the lead role. Overdub his lines and this would have been a fun waste of an hour or so. A chance to revisit the 80s crime dystopia movies.

It defies absolutely any imaginable logic (like the fact that the second bullet gets through his brain and he still lives well and powerfully - oh well, he got one in his chest before) makes me think that the authors believe we, the public, are some kind of ... whatever, who just want to see blood in a movie.

This review contains spoiler alerts & shame for all those involved.In the final scene the criminal team betrays each other, for reasons. The get-away truck pushes through concrete barriers designed to stop tanks, & characters have about as much depth of a kiddy pool. The title should be changed to Duex Ex Machina or Plot Armor, because the characters are saved at the last minute just so they can get to the next scene.If this movie was a candy bar, it would be an Almond Joy, without the almond or the joy.",

Him not realizing that diesel fluid won't ignite with a simple lighter or a burning cigar and regular gas would have been a much better choice if you're going to set someone on fire because it evaporates much easier. It is not the liquid fuel that ignites but the vapours being released as the fuel evaporates. So basically the victim could have just spat out the cigar into the bathtub full of diesel and the cigar would have gone out as if it had been dropped in water.\nNow, it could have been that our man is new to the burning people business and doesn't know these simple facts, for which he could be forgiven. But somehow the diesel doesn't only ignite, it also causes a major explosion, a remarkable feat considering how slowly diesel evaporates at room temperature and how long its vapours will sub-sequentially take to reach the LEL (Lower Explosion Level) concentration, especially in a bathroom with some big bloody holes in the walls that cause extra ventilation.\nThis is when I knew it wasn't due to any lack of experience from our man but simply a bad movie and I'd be better of doing something else than watching this movie.

But that doesnt mean the movie is garbage at all. The action sequences are convincing and fun (sometimes funny) with a great character build by michael pitt (natural born killers meets taxi driver) and a decent performance by ramirez when he does speak too much. The concept of the story is a bit far fetched but you learn to resonate with it as the world is unraveled. Car crashes alla michael bay-esque and a love tringle you're not sure what to make of complete the piece you probably watched already and are trying to convince yourself it wasnt that bad after all.

Then we introduce the femme fatale who just does not work for the story line and those doing her beck and call should know better. In the end there is a sunset, but who rides off into it is unrewarding. There are reviews galore giving this 1 & 2 and over 6 scores. Do not trust them. There is a long but kinda complete movie here. Minimal action and characters that behave, but sadly do not develop. I am putting this as a 3 stars as it just keeps going and going absent rewards to the reviewer. I can understand people like the setting and dystopia giving it one of two more stars. But, there was so much opportunity here to have a good movie and sadly it never made it to the final presentation. If you miss this one, you are not going to regret it much as there are few memorable moments or lines. Netflix is going to have to step up their game if this represents what they call dark dystopian Science Fiction.

Government and order unquestionably bad - anarchy and disorder, revered and praised. It is an interesting concept certainly but is executed so poorly, so hamfistedly and so condescendingly of the audience that it is a painful, and laborious viewing.

Don't lose hope. You too could make a terrible, terrible film and still have Netflix promote it so much that people will give it a go. I imagine some people even managed to sit through the whole thing. Not many, but probably some.Disclaimer: the last hour and ten minutes might be the finest piece of cinema ever committed to film. I didn't watch it, and I doubt I ever will, so I'll never know.",

None of the characters were at all likable, and very little real insight was given into them or their backgrounds, so they just came off very flat. Very little of the movie was actually about the proposed crime/heist, which would have been fine if the rest of the movie was interesting. One thing which really bothered me is some of the bad accents. Actors seem to slip in and out of various European accents throughout the movie without any in-movie explanation as to why this would be happening.

So bad that even the sex scenes are boring.The Last Days of American Crime glamourises criminality and expects its audience to applaud murderers and bank robbers.

It's the movie playing in the movie \"The Last Action Hero\" that starred Arnold Schwarzenegger.So lame you Internet people wouldn't get this style of movie. It has such a low rating bc people think they are Siskal and Ebert. I just read Ebert's review and you are all writing exactly the same review. No, that doesn't mean you are \"right\". It means you have no opinion whatsoever. Same old stuff I hear from critics about all movies. Well, I grew up enjoying watching movies. It used to be fun to watch over exaggerated representations of people. Movies are junk, it's entertainment. Why did everyone start watching movies as a way to understand life? Movies do not represent REAL LIFE. Movies are fake. They are supposed to not make sense. It's for fun. The rules of physics don't exist. Also... you know why you can't enjoy this movie.... B/c you take everything so LITERAL! The movie is being IRONIC. Learn how to spot these two words I just capitalized. .....I have to type paragraphs out as if I were addressing babies bc you all keep dwelling on dumb \"quickly punched in words\" that nobody thinks twice about, that people leave as their comments (half assed thought out comments). You have a problem if you are sitting here, voluntarily, reading words that \"hurt\" you. Anyways, back to literal and ironic, I know these are two very common words you Internet people always use incorrectly. Learn their meaning and you'll finally \"really\" wake up you dungeon gopher in grand makeup disguises, brainwashed backwards minority, as in a SMALL percentage, words have more than one meaning based on how the person uses them in a sentence. So if you never listen, you will never get a clue. And hence, you believe fake news\ud83d\ude1b\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc97Just watch it and laugh.It's like Face Off sorta.

            "content": "There's the adage that once you've hit bottom, you should stop digging. This movie hits bottom, and then goes down another few hundred feet, and then sinks lower. Seriously. This one film may hasten the invention of eye bleach. If you've read all the online reviews from every available cinematic media source, you'll find a level of negativity for this film usually reserved for environmental contamination disasters and presidential elections. Don't believe me? Go ahead and check - I'll wait.This movie is an exercise in brutally-executed tropes, toxic masculinity and audience masochism, with no redeeming quality whatsoever. It manages the impossible, both in leaving gaping plot holes while at the same time being entirely too long. There's no sense of continuity, logic, a cohesive structure, and not a single character is remotely well-developed or explained. But wait - it gets worse.One caveat: I have an all-consuming thing for \u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez, intense enough that if he knew about it, he'd reasonably seek a restraining order. I've tried to watch every film he's been in a couple or, you know, fifty times. I'd watch him sorting his socks. He is a gifted actor whose greatest strength lies in playing people who have actually existed: Bol\u00edvar, Carlos the Jackal, Versace At the start of his career, he was sadly typecast as either \"Priest\" or \"Operative With Gun.\" Trust me, he is a versatile talent - you just can't tell at all from this one movie. You can practically sense Ram\u00edrez struggling with this script, trying to channel - something, anything. It's painful to watch. I just want to snatch him out of this film, take him home and give him some soup. Don't worry, I'd gently reassure him, \"Wasp Network\" comes out soon, and others will be distracted when they see you in \"Jungle Cruise,\" should that ever be released, plus your attorney called about that protective order - would you like some more soup?He is not alone in his struggle. There is a regrettable love triangle - oh, so regrettable - and it involves Michael Pitt, who is desperately trying to channel someone himself. I'm not sure who, though. Is he Jack Nicholson in \"The Shining\"? Is he Joe Pesci in \"Goodfellas,\" or maybe Christian Slater in \"True Romance\"? Is he Mel Gibson at a DUI stop? I'm still not certain - someone please throw in here, I need some references. Is he Joaquin Phoenix as The Joker? Or is he River Phoenix decrying the use of any animal products whatsoever while quietly supporting drug dealers all over L.A.? Throw me a bone - I'm open to any and all suggestions.The third member of the love triangle is Anna Brewster, in a hybridized role as Manic Pixie Demon Girl, Official Online Hacker Chick, and Probably Mostly Likely Femme Fatale-Ish (Maybe). I get for the sake of the plot line that they had to squish a whole bunch of characters into one role, but that doesn't mean it worked. For someone with this many facets to her personality, she is surprisingly two-dimensional, and is barely holding onto that second dimension with acting this flat. She doesn't really - yeah, her sexy is questionable, her tech genius is implied rather than apparent, and she's most reminiscent of a PMSing Asia Argento crossed with a rabid squirrel. Got to hand it to Ram\u00edrez, though - they're both covered in blood and stink, she's puking her guts out, and they still manage to kiss one another deeply before sex. Yuck. Maybe that's cool if you're into that sort of thing.Rounding out the main cast is Sharlto Copley. I'm still not sure why he's in this, or what his character did to advance the plot. I'm not sure he knows, either. I think there's an unwritten law: When shooting a film featuring an urban dystopia, you have to use South Africa. And if you're filming anything in South Africa, you have to employ Sharlto Copley. Doesn't matter if it's based on an Edith Wharton novel or if it's a corporate training film, if it's anywhere near Jo-Berg, you'll see Copley in it.Other people have pointed out all the obvious flaws in this film, yet I still think they missed a couple. The bad timing in terms of current events and police brutality is probably the biggest gaffe mentioned - and it's several steps over the line of cringeworthy. Maybe the filmmakers or Netflix should have agreed to bury this for a few more months. There's a death ray being deployed by the U.S. government that is some sort of synaptic blocker to prevent all crime by making it neurologically impossible to do anything \"bad,\" but I guarantee that anything that pervasive would prevent pretty much anything business-related, from insider trading to the next WeWork. The economy as we know it would come crashing down, which is the opposite of the stability the government seeks by eliminating crime. This prospective mind-controlling dystopia makes Gilead look positively bucolic. And messing with brain chemistry like that seems like a lawsuit, between the risk of aneurysm, brain lesions or the rapid onset of disorders like multiple sclerosis or Lewy body dementia. Of course, good luck finding any competent attorney to bring a lawsuit with anyone being unable to think or do anything \"bad.\"The one theme that still hasn't been explained has been the sibling attachment that seems so prevalent in this movie. Ram\u00edrez's character cares deeply about his brother and is devastated by his brother's apparent suicide. Brewster's character betrays both Pitt and Ram\u00edrez for her own sister's wellbeing. Yet, there's no similar attachment to parents or children or even longterm romantic partners. That leaves Pitt's character's family as the most vile and dysfunctional of all, since he happily bumps off both his father and his sister, as his sociopathic father offed both Pitt's mother and stepmother (after Pitt had both introduced his dad to Wife No. 2 as well as having slept with her). It's very Oedipal, this whole dynamic, and I'd suggest therapy, though Pitt seems to have a fairly perceptive knowledge of the psychological machinations at play. If he was already in therapy, apparently he wasn't in it long enough. Or it didn't take.It is thoroughly difficult to adapt novels, graphic novels and comic books to the screen. There's a lot that's lost in the transition, and some adaptations are a lot better than others. This film seems like it wants to be \"Sin City,\" with a heist that's sort of \"Ocean's Eleven\" (or \"Twelve\" or \"Thirteen\") with a little bit of exposition like \"Children of Men\" - so maybe someone should have watched those films instead of just reading their descriptions on Amazon. This isn't even a fun bad movie, it's just a sad bad movie. The whole progression of the underlying story is pointless, a blind alley ending in a brick wall. The best that can be hoped for with this hot mess is that there won't be a sequel, since two of the main characters are pretty much dead. I think. Given that the writer/director worked on the sequels to other action movies, that's not a for-sure thing - we can only hope and pray.",

Yes, lots of shells are fired into to cars that wind up with no holes in them but that's a small price to pay. Viewers need to use their imaginations instead of having everything handed to them on a platter. The plot is a bit \"out there\" yet very interesting. It's filled with bad guys that you absolutely LOVE to HATE. Nobody gets out unscathed in some fashion or another. The fast pace distracts from the two and a half hour running time. The very best of this film, in my opinion, was the acting of Michael Carmen Pitt. He did a superb job as the demented son of a huge crime boss who is trying to make his own legacy. His portrayal reminded me of Jeffery Goines in \"12 Monkeys\". Totally on edge. Totally unpredictable. Totally nuts! See it for yourself. Critics screw up too!",

It feels like one of the early GTA games where the character runs around aimlessly doing whatever crime other people tell them to.Brick, the lead character lacks any real depth- he is supposed to be motivated by vengeance, although it's not quite clear how he will achieve this though the heist. However, he fails to really show any flicker of notable emotion during the entire 2.5 hour movie.The film is so disjointed it really is impossible to follow and enjoy. It leaves you feeling of confused and frustrated.Overall the writing is just terrible and I would recommend watching any of the purge movies if you had a taste for a dystopian crime/horror of this nature on Netflix.
