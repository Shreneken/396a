            "content": "\"Sound of Metal\" really surprised me.I thought it was going to be a movie about a rock musician's struggle with suddenly losing his hearing. And that is the specific situation that sets the movie's plot in motion. But this movie is less about learning to live with deafness and more about learning to live with life in general, making peace with things as they change instead of trying to \"fix\" them so you can get back to where you were. That makes \"Sound of Metal\" one of the most relevant pandemic movies I've yet seen.Riz Ahmed is terrific in the main role, and he's wonderfully supported by Paul Raci, as leader of a deaf commune and support group, and by Olivia Wilde, as his girlfriend. One of the film's most devastating scenes is one toward the end where the couple decide to end their relationship, not because they've necessarily fallen out of love, but because the relationship itself is tying them both to a past they need to move on from.\"Sound of Metal\" brought home to me how much of our lives is spent absorbing noise. And that's noise of every kind -- emotional and mental as well as aural. The constant grind of news and social media and stupid politicians and advertising and capitalism clamors for our attention and keeps us distracted from things that really matter. How nice it would be if we, like Ahmed's character in the film's final scene, could just turn it off and sit in silence.\"Sound of Metal\" won the 2020 Oscars for Film Editing and Sound (richly deserved; the sound design for huge parts of the movie puts the audience in the position of hearing the world as experienced by a person with hearing loss). It was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor (Ahmed), Best Supporting Actor (Raci), and Best Original Screenplay.Grade: A.",

            "content": "I was incredibly fortunate to have seen Sound of Metal at the Toronto International Film Festival including a Q&A after with the director and cast. Whereas a lot of films may take the storyline into melodramatic territory, Sound of Metal explores not only the reality of those who are deaf which is so poorly represented in film and television but also the destructive nature and high cost of denial and self-deception in the face of hard truths.By focusing on someone whose entire existence revolves around a world of sound losing that which defines his life, it gives the viewer pause to consider what life can be like when we learn to accept and let go. There is so much more to life than the small corners of existence we live in and this film paints that reality with both tremendous empathy and a bluntness that lesser writers and directors would avoid.In addition, one really has to commend the direction and design of this film's audio. It is clear that a great deal of thought went into how to use sound in this film. From the in-your-face pounding of metal music at the start through the muffled reality as the protagonist loses his hearing to the sense of peace in the moments of silence, it is clear that a great deal of painstaking detail was crafted in conveying this film's reality.Sound of Metal is one of those films which will keep you thinking for days after about so many aspects of life such as addiction and how some relationships may simply serve a purpose in the short term for our life but ultimately must be let go. How it illuminates aspects of the deaf community that few get a chance to see is important. But there is so much more to this film that to pigeonhole it as merely being about deaf people does a grand disservice to the many fantastic qualities in every aspect of its creation. I highly recommend taking the time to watch this film.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Many of us have attended concerts and experienced a ringing in our ears for a while afterwards. Have you ever thought about the musicians who are playing that music night after night? It's a risk requiring precautions ... and even then, disaster can occur. The first narrative feature from writer-director Darius Marder uses the hearing loss of a heavy metal drummer to explore what happens when the life we know is suddenly snatched away.Riz Ahmed (TV mini-series \"The Night Of\") stars as Ruben, the aforementioned drummer. The film opens with Ruben drumming on stage as his lead singer/girlfriend Lou (underrated Olivia Cooke, THOROUGHBREDS, \"Bates Motel\") screams out the lyrics punk-style for their band, Blackgammon. We witness Ruben's euphoria in the moment, with his \"Please Kill Me\" tattoo visible across his chest. Afterwards, we see the couple in their RV living a happy life of veggie juice, yoga, and slow dancing between gigs. The first crack in the armor is Lou's scratching her arm from anxiety, and the next is devastating for Ruben and the couple.Ahmed is terrific in the most important moments, and he's assisted by top notch sound design from Nicolas Becker (GRAVITY, 2013). This allows us to feel and experience the moment Ruben realizes he has a problem, and how he begins to process this. Director Marder utilizes subtitles/closed captioning throughout, both for the deaf community and to make Ruben's situation visceral for viewers. When the doctor explains hearing loss, frustration and defiance kick in for Ruben. He becomes focused on the $40-80,000 cochlear implant option, and views it as a way to maintain his normal life.Lou becomes worried for Ruben's well-being, and we learn he's a recovering heroin addict. He reluctantly agrees to a remote deaf community/rehab facility run by Joe (Paul Raci). It's here that Ruben learns sign language and begins to adjust to his new reality. Joe is a very patient and sage advisor, and preaches that being deaf is not a handicap - it's not viewed as something to fix. Implants are considered an affront to the deaf culture, and the film neither shies away from this conflict, nor magnifies it.The clash between Joe's patience and guidance, and Ruben's desire to get his normal life back comprise much of the film. The final scene between the two is gut-wrenching thanks to extraordinary acting from Ahmed and especially Raci. Supporting work in the film is provided by Lauren Ridloff (a hearing-impaired actor) and Matthieu Amalric as Lou's dad. The final act is quite something to watch. The director says the film is about the finality of life changes, and letting go of what we can't fix. Joe urges Ruben to appreciate the stillness, and we also see a love story that served its purpose and run its course. Will the distortion lead Ruben to find peace in the stillness? Depending on your stance in regards to the debate within the deaf community, the ending either works for you or it doesn't. Either way, it's well done and well-acted.\nAmazon Studios will release this in theaters November 20, 2020 and on Prime Video December 4, 2020",

And it is also flawlessly done. The performances are intimate, the sounds/silences keep drawing you in, and the moments of stillness are absolutely breathtaking. Marder's crafted something that feels so personal and authentic, an invitation into these characters' lives and experiences. When the credits rolled, I just sat there taking it in.",

            "content": "I was diagnosed with a progressive hearing loss when I was about four years old and received my cochlear implants when I was eight and ten.While I think that this movie is fantastic when it comes to raising awareness for the Deaf community as well as highlighting its pros and cons, it fails to reach when it comes to medical information. I LOVED the fact that they show how Ruben is ostracized after he receives the surgery, as well as explaining the reasoning from the Deaf perspective. However, the surgical and actual cochlear implant information is very, very misleading.Number one, you may see reviews saying that healthcare does cover cochlear implants, it is more rare than you'd think because it isn't seen as a medically necessary procedure because deaf people can exist within society (in very limited and isolated ways, and their opportunities for success compared to hearing people is SIGNIFICANTLY lower, check the facts if you get mad at this).Number two, the surgery that they give him is absolutely ridiculous. You can't just GET cochlear implants and sign up for a surgery online, it is an extensive process that requires many pre-appointments, follow-ups, bloodwork, eligibility checks, etc. Cochlear implants are for very specific cases and are not a cure-all, as they show in the movie (to some extent, although they do talk more in depth about it).Lastly, and most disappointingly, the scene where the audiologist just tells Ruben he has to \"learn and accept\" that hearing isn't the same and that he just has to \"get used to it\" is complete BS. As someone who had hearing aids and natural hearing for a good portion of their childhood, I can confirm that after about a year they sound exactly the same, assuming you have a good audiologist and are doing the proper listening therapy exercises and such. They vastly oversimplified the process for mapping and programming, as he was there and was told he was set after two tweaks. I am at my audiologist for about four to six hours every time I go.Overall, great, great movie, but the implant misinformation, especially the last thing I mentioned, really brought it down for me. Definitely a make or break moment and for me the latter. Just be aware of that when you're watching.",

Getting implants is not a quick process and a good audiologist would never tell a patient you're just going to have to get used to it. It takes multiple visits before and after surgery. That being said, I really enjoyed the scenes with the deaf community and him working with the children. I would give the acting 10/10. It has a great cast.I also want to point out that there's absolutely nothing wrong with a person with hearing loss getting implants if they choose to and they shouldn't be shamed for it. But, it's also okay if you don't want implants, nobody should make you feel bad about either choice.",

            "review_title": "Fantastic film; the double entendre title won't hit you til the end!",
            "content": "First off, Rizwan Ahmed is one of the best actors working right now and his performance in this film is gut wrenching, believable, and absolutely stunning to watch as you can do nothing but become engrossed in his acting and ability to make you feel exactly what his character is feeling. It's hard to believe that there was ever anyone else in mind for his role!The title is an incredibly clever and subtle nod, not just to the fact that he and his onscreen girlfriend are in a metal band but ultimately, the hearing that IS restored through the cochlear implants Ruben is so dead set on getting doesn't sound what he had hoped for and it all has a very metallic, tinny sound to it. It may have helped to restore most of his hearing but it sounds like metal.And that was the core conflict of the film; Ruben, after learning that his condition will only worsen and is told about the cochlear implants at his very first appointment to assess his hearing loss and despite the fact that the doctor is advising him to slow down and consider his options, immediately sets about trying to afford the surgery, thinking that it will restore his life to \"normal\" and he can just get back to living his nomadic life on the road with his wealthy-through-her-father girlfriend, Lou (played by the always enjoyable Olivia Cooke). Lou, however, can see the writing on the wall and loving Ruben, wants desperately for him to get better and accept his condition. She is the one who makes the calls and moves to get Ruben into a rehab for the deaf.Ruben, of course, is hesitant to participate in this because it would mean separating from Lou during his stay and actually having to learn how to live with his deafness instead of pretending like it can all be wiped away magically with the cochlear surgery. Lou winds up taking matters into her own hands and arranges to go back home to France, where her wealthy father lives, and very convincingly convinces Ruben to stay and go to the rehab for the deaf despite her love for him and her own wish for them not to be separated. She loves him, just as much as he loves her, but she knows that he needs this and is worried not only that he isn't accepting the reality of his hearing loss but that he may relapse from his heroin addiction, after having been clean for 4 years and the entire time during their relationship, when she witnesses him starting to smoke cigarettes again.There is tension between Ruben and the main guy who runs the rehab. And this is due to a very real split within the deaf community about the feelings surrounding cochlear implants and whether being deaf is something that needs \"fixed\" or is even a disability. Deaf people have managed just fine for many years without cochlear implants and have formed communities and relationships that don't define them as being disabled...so for Ruben to be so gung ho about getting the implants while also attending this rehab, learning how to be deaf, forming bonds and relationships with other deaf people, and then lying and deceiving all of those people to run off and get the cochlear implants causes an irreparable rift between him and the rehabilitation facility, especially the main guy who runs the place. He tries to explain these feelings to Ruben, but Ruben is still so hopeful that this surgery will have fixed everything and still refusing to accept that perhaps deafness isn't as bad as he seems to think it is that the words never really sink in and he leaves the rehab in a very hurtful and curt manner.After going back to the doctors to test out and adjust his new implants, it is only THEN that he realizes that cochlear implants, while an amazing solution for some, is not the cure-all he assumed it would be and this is the first time he seems to realize that he will never hear again the way he once did, that everything he hears now will be filtered through this metallic, tinny sounding implant, hence The Sound of Metal working so well as a movie title.Ruben makes his way to France to find that his girlfriend, Lou, looks and acts vastly different than she did when she was living her bohemian life with him in the RV; instead of having bleached eyebrows, her hair is now soft and natural brown, she is living back at home with her father, their relationship seemingly repaired (with her dad even thanking Ruben for being there for Lou at one point), and she has clearly moved on and up from whatever situation she and Ruben were in before. It is at this point that Ruben realizes that because he truly does love Lou, he must let her go and be the woman she was meant to be, not tied or bogged down by him, and that he must deal with his issues himself. He packs his things and leaves while she is sleeping to spare her any further pain and then the movie ends on a rather ambiguous note; we go through portions of hearing nothing at all, hearing things as they are through the implant, and Ruben spends the final moments of the movie looking up at the sun through the trees before the credits roll.Did Ruben finally accept that his deafness wasn't necessarily the life-ending disability he thought it was? Is he dedicated to working on improving his hearing with the implant? Does he feel guilty over the way he left things at the rehab? Does he feel like he made a mistake by getting the surgery?I feel like the ending hints at the last of those being true. Perhaps if he had stayed at the rehab and learned to accept his deafness, he would have found that inner peace that the guy who ran the place kept trying to help him find; he kept giving Ruben the tools he needed and Ruben just kept refusing to use them. There was one point where Ruben even realized be could keep time and still play drums without hearing the music and he's teaching this skill to a class of deaf children but again, Ruben's inability to see beyond his immediate desire of getting those implants leaves him unable to fully appreciate all the help that he's receiving and all of the people he's ultimately hurting by making the choice he does.Additionally, I've got to agree with everyone else that the use of sound in this film was absolutely fantastic and incredibly artful. You very much feel like you are living in Ruben's headspace. At many points throughout the movie, we hear things exactly as Ruben does, whether that means hearing nothing at all, very muffled sounds, or the metallic sound of his cochlear implants and it makes it all the more easy to empathize with his struggle and to perhaps understand his motives and choices even if they aren't necessarily the ones we would choose for ourselves if we were in his shoes.This was an excellent movie and I liked the ambiguity of the ending. It leaves open the possibility for people to take away from it what they want and as another poster mentioned, depending on your opinions or views on cochlear implants and deafness/deaf communities, it will definitely make you feel something one way or the other.",

He's always intense and, most importantly, he always makes you care about the characters he's portraying. In this case, he portrays a rock drummer who is losing his hearing.As with most of his roles, he more than did his homework. Ahmed moved to Brooklyn for a few months and learned to play drums, he also spent a lot time with people from the deaf community. He showed the same dedication for his Naz Khan role in 'The Night Of', he immersed himself in the character's background. Expect no less from this actor.Having two partially deaf relatives, I could relate to this film. Especially one relative who refused to learn sign language, they would rather read lips. Thinking of my relatives initially denying their hearing loss, this film really hit home.Why are people bringing up Riz being Pakistani? With every role, will he continue to be defined by his background? His character was named Ruben, it's assumed his character was Hispanic. Riz can play other nationalities and ethnic groups beyond his own South Asian background. He can certainly pass for Hispanic, especially in this film. When considering Riz for a role, directors and producers should think outside the box.The ending was extremely effective, but not a surprise at all.Another excellent performance from Riz Ahmed. A few more films like this and he will finally have earned his Oscar.",

            "content": "Riz Ahmen is Ruben, a drummer in a hard rock \"band\" (which is just him and his girlfriend, Oliva Cooke). They share a strangely quiet, gentle existence living out of an old Air Stream and travelling the country. Their music is loud and angry; their lives are restrained. We learn that Ruben is a recovering addict and we soon learn that he is suddenly and quickly losing his hearing. It's a devastating diagnosis. To lose his hearing is to make who he thinks he is (a drummer & overall musician) nearly impossible. He is encouraged to go to a home for newly deaf adults who are also addicts. (One of the faults of the movie is that we aren't told exactly why or how this decision is reached. One day, he's just going there.) Ruben works to fit in and gradually finds a place for himself. But in the back of his mind, all this is a \"holding pattern\" while he tries to come up with the funds to get a cochlear implant to regain his hearing.Ahmed is never less than amazing. The awards season recognition he's getting is well-deserved. He is pretty quiet through most of the movie, yet never totally peaceful. He is a deeply decent person, even gentle...yet he has demons he must wrestle with. Ahmed can convey these battles and contradictions just by sitting there and letting us see his face and eyes. You can feel how cheated he reckons himself to be. You can see when he's drawn to simple things like teaching a deaf child how to drum his hands rhythmically. You can see his battle to contain his anger and confusion. His first \"AA\" meeting at the center, where everyone speaks in a sign language he hasn't begun to learn yet, is quite arresting because you can see how overwhelming it all it, yet he barely moves. His performance is worth seeing, 100%. (I would also point out that the sound design is EXCELLENT and so critical.But the events of the movie are shown so frustratingly. We have no real idea of how much time is passing? When he learns sign language, has it been a week or a year? Olivia Cooke's character (and performance?) give us almost nothing to go by. We initially like her because Ruben does, but we really don't know her at all, and the script and actor give us little to go by. And strangely, as arresting as Ahmed's performance is, I found myself not actually caring all that much about how everything turned out. Key events in the character's journey seem to be skipped. Major plot points (and there aren't many) are presented in a sketchy manner. It all led to a movie that feels like less than the sum of its parts.By all means, see if just for Ahmed's performance. But I think the film itself is SO specific (a rock drummer addict who is suddenly deaf and must adjust but also wants surgery because he thinks it will be a cure-all to return him to his old life) that it forgets to clarify things that those of us who haven't had this specific experience are sometimes left in the dark. It's an overall miss for me.",

            "review_title": "Film Review: The Sound of Metal",
            "content": "The sound of trees, the sound of distant traffic, the sound of coffee dripping into a pot, Darius Marder's directorial debut Sound of Metal is a study on the sounds of humanity, beauty and growth.The film opens with a punk rock performance featuring only two musicians; the scene is loud and energetic with handheld camera movements capturing a woman vocalist and a man on the drums, resting behind them like a gunner sits before a 50 caliber turret. Darius Marder, being the writer of the 2012 punk masterpiece The Place Beyond The Pines, feels like a director with punk-rock origins in his veins, and a keen sense of sobering humanity within every frame. To be frank, I don't think anyone other than Tyler Durden himself or Ryan Gosling could have helmed the leading role of this picture to the degree that the spectacular Riz Ahmed has. He turns the story of Ruben Stone, a drummer going deaf, into something eerily real and relatable.As we get to know Ruben better, we learn that his partner on the stage is also his partner in crime and sweetheart Lou or Lulu (Olivia Cooke). Together, the two stir up astounding emotions and recall of our own young love and the stories that proceed it.But this is Reuben's story, and with each passing moment, his hearings fleeting disappearance becomes the main antagonist of the picture. Despite the brief takes of Rueben and Lulu's hardships, which include faint hints of suicide, nothing is as hard as the reality of his own inevitable deafness. Yet, no matter how sad or trouble both of these protagonist's life before the start of the film may be, I found it interesting and impressive that the director choose not to touch too much upon their backstories, and allowed these little nuances to add to a film telling a very clear and present, almost magnetic story about people in the now, present at this very moment.While the film centres on the relationship between the two punk rock lovers, Sound of Metal begins unearthing the trails and tribulations of how a broke and passionate couple deal with such traumatic and realistic health scares.While Reuben's deafness worsens and his health rapidly begins to decline, his options are quite simple; either deal with his deafness and adapt his life to it, or perform an implant procedure that could resurrect his hearing, the latter, costing upwards of eighty thousand dollars.Reminiscent of the first time I ever saw 127 Hours, the film's sound is as crucial a characters as Rueben or Lulu. Vibrations throughout the film really gives the audience a sense of Rueben's sonic displeasure and fleeting health-this fact alone gives worth to seeing Sound of Metal in a theatre. It is no surprise that the sound mixing and sound editing of the film is top notch, easily being comparable to Damien Chazelle's debut feature film Whiplash.Using very clever filming techniques, including cutting back and forth between regular dialogue and muffled ambience from Ruben's perspective, Marder's directorial choices seem very confident and seasoned, providing audiences with a cinematic movie-going experience. Truly heartbreaking and constantly upsetting, the film is as resilient as Rueben's will to continue being a musician. Avoiding the advice of his doctors to omit loud noises, Ruben stubbornly ignores all caution, quickly and almost abruptly by showcasing a medium shot of him on stage, mid-show, raging on a drum solo; sweating with passion and the brass villain known as Rueben's drum symbolls.There are scenes of real heart in Sound of Metal. Rueben's confession to Lulu being one of them, but also, the whole process of recovery is truly a humanistic milestone and cinematic feast of human endurance and love. Communicating via notepads, words and writing, Lulu and Rueben begin a journey together that they both know could depart their love for something that has made them closer, and ultimately, who they are as people. Bleak, brazen and loud as heck, Sound of Metal is also an optimistic energy rush of a film.While Sound of Metal is, first and foremost, a love story, the story of love becomes unclear whether its towards that of Lulu, or the will to be a performer; a love of entertaining, a longing of drumming. Much like Whiplash, and Miles Teller's finale scene in the film, the film is doused in the constant condensation of the dum set and Reuben's tattooed body. This is a strong ode to the love of music, a love letter to the loud and obnoxious sounds of rock and roll and hard core metal.Joining Ahmed and Cooke in this passion project, is the ultra-talented Paul Raci, a confidant to Rueben and Lulu seeing to recovering his health. Raci's Joe provides the film with an outsiders look into the love and strong will Rueben has towards his craft and the people who trusts the most.Marder's debut feature is truly a wonder to behold. Showing confidence in every frame, Marder's camera is placed frequently behind his protagonist's shoulders, constantly heightening his profile and Rueben's silhouette during his performances. This unseen method of capturing live music, along with his decision to capture their performances with the use of the documentary style shaky cam, adds a sense of uncertainty to the character and to the narrative as a whole.Yet, as loud and vibrated Sound of Metal really is, there is a sense of tranquility to it. Clarity and intense scenes plagued in silence are some of the most captivating and devastatingly powerful, throughout. The quiet stillness that Rueben adapts as the film progresses, not only adds to the evolution of the character, but also the progression of the narrative and strength in Abraham Marder and Darius Marder's script.Sound of Metal is a rapturous, soulful, wildfire of a film that isn't easy to tame, or ease, or really forget at all. A truly transitional, transcendent and soul-searching cinematic experience, that will devastate you, crush you and echo throughout your memory, well after the credits begin to roll. Metallic, brilliant and raw, Sound of Metal along with Ahmed's sobering as an ice-bath performance is a kinetic and electrifying cinematic movie-going experience. Spellbinding, atmospheric and alluring, Sound of Metal is a triumph in art.",

I didn't think events unfolded in a particularly compelling way, and it feels strangely bloated at 2 hours, owing to the relative simplicity of the premise.Apparently there is a 100-minute long cut though, which could be a good deal better, in all honesty (but on Amazon Prime Australia at least, I could only see the 2-hour version).",

            "content": "About how to live with the stillness of oneself, which whether you are deaf or not - and the filmmakers must know that the greater part of the audience watching and hearing this can take the movie in with all their senses - is always a massively difficult weight to bear psychically; the absolute, all-encompassing joy and power (but also the work) of being in a community that understands and accepts and in its way loves you, and visa versa, and that maybe that one two-person noise-metal group needs a hiatus now and again.This is beautiful, sensitively done storytelling about a figure who is so empathetic because he tries to avoid being a cliche even as he figures so closely into being one. He's just a human being not sure how to handle being disabled, and yet the empathy is off the charts because the first time (!) director (collaborating with Derek Cianfrance) strips away sentiment to lay bare the souls of not just Ruben and Lou but everyone in this group.Ahmed is nothing short of miraculous here, for those moments by himself most of all where as Ruben he has to reckon with everything that's come his way (though I found the moment I got most emotional, not that there weren't a few scattered about, was when he has bonded most strongly with the kids and his innocence is laid bare). But what's most remarkable is you understand how his relatuonship with Lou is so intense and easy to break and has all of this history - and then when he is just itching to do what he does by the third act why he does it and yet wht it's such a tragedy, in particular with the veteran.And if the dramaturgy is outstanding, so is the technical realization: Sound of Music depicts in precise cinematic grammar, in specifically shifts in point of view, what it's like to be in this state of disability, is terrific, and so of course it's one of the great examples of sound design I've come across since WALL*E. If Ahmed doesn't get the Oscar, then the mixers and editors should. If it's shy of being #1 of this year (and it's so so so one of the films that I needed to see most after this year, for all the reasons above for how the film is about what it's about), it's that one can see where yhis story will go by the end, so there isn't the suspense about Ruben's situation. On the other hand, maybe it doesn't need it.",

            "content": "\"When this crappy, mundane world suddenly becomes radiant and magnificent...all the fear is gone.\"This film is an achievement on pretty much all levels. A simple yet complex story, Sound of Metal brings a lot to the table. Riz Ahmed plays Ruben, a drummer whose hearing is rapidly deteriorating. He does an amazing job. Similar to Sally Hawkins in The Shape of Water, some of the acting is silent and mainly in ASL. When not using ASL, he ranges from quiet moments to high, extreme levels of acting. Beforehand, I wasn't quiet sure how he would do. The buzz around his performance kept building, even though some hadn't even seen the film. I don't think they could've found a better actor in the scenario. This is a career defining performance and I can't wait to see what happens with it come awards season. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention Olivia Cooke and Paul Raci. Raci has the second most screentime-at least I think-and he has some really impactful scenes. Mainly, his dialogue is strong. Like Ahmed, he uses both English and ASL but primarily ASL. I wanted a little more with his character because he is there as guidance for Ruben. I could compare him to Sam Elliott in A Star is Born. Raci is the voice of judgment and has some meaty scenes. The difference is we don't delve quite as much into his character, at least as much as I wanted to. And Cooke is also a voice of judgement, but as the girlfriend. Not too much for character development or defining scenes, but the genuine performance makes up for it. I'm glad the film takes a different approach and not the typical girlfriend we might see in this type of film. She's there to help and not there to cause any drama. The casting from the lead to the small roles are all great.This is a screenplay heavy film. Not in the sense of dialogue, but rather the description and what is happening. I haven't seen the screenplay or anything like that, but you can just tell. Darius Marder directed this extremely well. He co-wrote with Abraham Marder and the story is by Derek Cianfrance, so he has a great sense of what he wants to convey. Through tone, sound, and what is shown on screen, he hit everything right. The only thing I would like to fix with the writing and directing is some of the pacing. As I mentioned before, the film is focused on the quiet, tender moments. Sometimes this means there's not much happening. It's clever to have this but the film can feel slow at times. The runtime is 130 minutes and about 10 could've been cut down. I don't know where it could have used the most cuts but a little bit could've been helpful.Besides the acting, writing, and directing, the sound design is one of the shining achievements. The whole film is beaded around sound. But the way they edited and mixed everything actually puts you in Ruben's headspace. You are becoming hearing with him. Then there's moments where we hear what is actually happening as a non deaf/hearing-impaired individual. Those moments of realization aid in the experience. Emotion is built with that choice. Now there's a decision made by Ruben and it's part of what we can hear with him. I'm so glad we could be part of that. The only time something like that has been done was in the TV series Undone. The sound design there is so spectacular that it could win a majority of the sound awards. If there's one thing that you can take from this film, it's that sound is a virtue.",

This makes the first half or so of the movie quite an ordeal, though in a positive way as it helps you empathise with people who suffer something like this.However, having set up the plot the movie does drift towards the end.

            "content": "The story here takes you into the world of the deaf and the hearing impaired and demonstrates what it's like to be without one's hearing. I have a bit of trouble in that department myself but nowhere as difficult; I'm forced to use captioning on the movies I watch because the dialog in most films sounds garbled to me. Still, I can't comprehend being totally deaf in the way it affected someone who relies on hearing for their occupation. I thought Riz Ahmed was very effective as drummer Ruben Stone, experiencing almost near total hearing loss while performing with his girlfriend while on tour with a band. Though I think anyone in the same circumstance would harbor anger and denial, it did seem that Ruben accepted his fate more quickly and agreeably than most once he came within Joe's (Paul Raci) orbit at the community for the deaf. It was heartwarming also to see how he ingratiated himself with the young school kids who helped him adjust with his signing. Where the picture skewed considerably from the story line was in the freedom Ruben had to check his emails and have access to his van after Joe set down rules for no contact with the outside world. That all seemed a bit too loose, for example, with Ruben having the keys for his vehicle after first surrendering them to Joe. The story also punted on how easily he was able to locate Lou (Olivia Cooke) in France, not to mention how he got there with no money after accounting for his surgery. Once there, I was also waiting for the shoe to drop on whether Lou found herself another boyfriend. It seemed that wasn't the case, although her reluctance with Ruben in an intimate moment suggested that may have been true. Full circle for Ruben occurs when he removes his hearing aids to contemplate the silence upon hearing the distorted pealing of the church tower bells. The look on his face suggested Joe's earlier comment about moments of stillness equating to the kingdom of God. I liked that analogy when Joe made the remark, though in that moment of silence, one is left to consider what Ruben's next move would be.",

One day Ruben wakes up to hearing loss. The rest is just a drudged out look at how he learns to cope. But he really doesn't learn. Because to be honest, the filmmakers wanted you to feel how real a person would react. Especially someone as self involved and empty as Ruben. He is recommended to a deaf camp where though he ends up having that rudimentary arc of learning to adapt to his deafness, he still insists that he can beat the odds. People like this are infuriating to medical professionals, because they can't absorb what they are recommended. Nor should he. But does he have to be a dead-eyed child about it? Probably, since on top of now being deaf, he's also a former addict.\nHis goal in this was never to get better or see how this type of living can benefit his chip-on-the-shoulder arrogance, but to get back to his former junkie girlfriend. Whom we discover later has come from very tragic circumstances. Yes, we've heard and seen these types before (at least I have). Wealthy people suffer as well.

It's not that he has freewill to decide to do the right thing, it's that he isn't given that choice but still pretends he has.\nFrustrating as it may be, there may have been a small injection of Hollywood they could've put in (I know, most of you people who complain about Hollywood-izing a story will complain the loudest). But a scrap of kindness and revelation, that which makes a working man viewer appreciate the world as a hopeful place.

            "content": "So why did Sound of Metal interest me so much? For those who know me, it really shouldn't be any surprise. I'm a musician myself, specialising in the heavier genres. I spent the best years of my life writing, practicing, rehearsing, recording, and performing my music across the country. I never reached the level of success I'd have liked, and before I could everything fell apart. It's an aspect of my life that I still struggle to come to terms with today. Those dreams of getting back on stage, the joy I find from writing and playing my own music, or becoming invested in the music of others never left. But for those years in my 20s, Sound of Metal was my absolute nightmare scenario. The worst thing that I felt could happen to me was turning deaf. Even today it's the disability I fear the most as music is still so hugely important to my life and my wellbeing.Ruben is the drummer of a metal duo with his girlfriend Lou. They play loud, they play aggressive, and they're living the dream of touring the country in a camper they've made their home. And then suddenly Ruben's hearing disappears. His ability to follow on with Lou on stage is taken from him and he finds himself lost and struggling to find a way back to how things were. Lou leaves him with a deaf group home who help those most in need, and Ruben finds himself even further lost in the community he now finds himself a part of. He has to learn a new way of life, and a new way of communicating. He can't let go of the idea of getting back to Lou and music and touring, and honestly I can't blame him. I couldn't either.But it's deeper than that. Lou's also an ex-addict, and so his focus on getting back to how things were holds a whole new depth of meaning. He's addicted to hearing. He can't sit still and be with his thoughts; he has to be constantly doing something. It all culminates in one of the most powerful moments after he gets the surgery for implants and confronts the head of the group home, Joe, who points out how Ruben's behaviour is like that of an addict; frenetic, obsessive, asking for money, fidgety. This movie is about a musician losing his hearing; one of the most catastrophic things that can happen to him, but it's also about addiction, grief, and acceptance of a sudden new life.And Sound of Metal never falls on clich\u00e9 to get this message across either. On a number of occasions I expected the plot to bend in certain ways, as I've grown to expect from fiction these days, but this film resists that and instead keeps the dramatic focus tightly focussed on Ruben and his hearing/addiction/grief. For instance, he never causes trouble at the group home that causes him to get kicked out, he never hooks up with the cute deaf teacher he's introduced to, he never gets caught using Joe's computer to message Lou, and when he goes back to Lou there's no drama there either. She's moved on without him, but still has room for him. There's no new boyfriend, she's there with open arms and a smile just happy to be back with him. I really appreciated this, because it just added so much more weight and realism to the story. It made it feel real and human, rather than like it manipulated its characters for dramatic effect.But what I appreciated most about this movie was how it put us in Ruben's shoes throughout. We're with him when his hearing first goes, like the volume gets turned down with a slight ringing. We hear the low booms of his own voice and the thud of him slapping his ears as that's all he's left to hear. We hear the quiet and somewhat tinny voice of the doctor reading random words out, and like him we can't quite make out what they are. When he goes to the group home, he has no idea what's being said around him, and we the audience, unless we know ASL, are similarly left confused and lost. But fantastically, once he starts learning ASL himself, we get subtitles, so like him we start to understand what the other deaf people around him are saying. And then he gets his implants and, like him, we hear the tinny static and beeps, the overwhelming, distorted, and unfocussed sounds of literally everything around him. And finally, when he takes the implant receivers off, we hear pure silence. The absolute quiet of absolute deafness. The sound design in this movie is nothing short of spectacular, with meticulous thought put into every audible detail, portraying what it would be like to lose your hearing and get it back through implants in a way that words simply couldn't describe. This film would've been nowhere near as powerful without Jaime Baksht's exquisite sound design.Another aspect responsible for how powerful the movie is lies on its acting cast as well. Riz Ahmed has proven time and time again how capable he is as an actor, and Sound of Metal is one of his finest performances yet. He goes through that first stage of grief so effortlessly, in complete denial of his condition. His anger bursts forth in violent waves, as he beats a doughnut to crumbs, carefully tries to assemble it back into the shape of a doughnut, only to continue smashing it out of frustration. The sad undercurrents of every moment he's on screen, and his difficulty in resisting the pull of a drug high to make the pain go away. Even at his happiest moments, helping with the kids at the deaf school, or finally making it back to Lou, are tinged with sadness at the life he's been forced to leave behind. Those final moments of peaceful acceptance are incredibly moving as he sits there, watches life silently carry on around him, finally accepting that he can never go back to that life, he can't drag Lou back to it. The fact he spent months learning both how to play drums and how to use ASL, to a point where he makes both look easy, just shows the sheer dedication he had to this role.But Ahmed isn't the only one deserving of praise in this movie. Paul Raci is also fantastic as Joe, able to bring his own real-life experiences into the character in order to add credence and authenticity. Raci was born of deaf parents and learned ASL before he learned to talk, and has been an active member of the deaf community for decades, teaching ASL and being in a deaf rock/metal band himself. And to top it off, he's an actual Vietnam veteran as well. But that's just dressing. His performance here is fantastic regardless of his real-life experience with aspects of this movie. The scene he shares with Ahmed after Ruben has had the surgery is one of the only moments a cast member out-acts Ahmed. The quiet, calm, and yet heartbreakingly disappointment he manages to convey is one of the most powerful moments in the whole film. Olivia Cooke likewise manages to keep up really well, with her standout scene being the moment she decides to leave in a cab, forcing Ruben to go back to the group home. You can tell she doesn't want to do it, but she does it because she knows it's what's best for him (a favour he returns later on).This movie was really something. I'll admit I didn't find myself particularly moved while watching it until its closing moments, but while researching and writing this review I've had to hold back tears. This movie hits closer to home than even I anticipated, and it doesn't make a single wrong step. It has Derek Cianfrance's fingerprints all over it, and while I couldn't review I Know This Much is True, Sound of Metal matches it in tone and power (seriously, if you don't mind watching depressively bleak stuff, go watch I Know This Much is True). The story itself is important to me, but it's elevated to even greater heights by the immersive attention to detail in the sound design and the heartbreaking performances across the board. I give Sound of Metal a 9/10. No doubt this is a movie that will stick with me for a long time to come.P. S. If you're a fellow musician, look after your ears. They're your most important tool.",

Phone and transport confiscated? Why? Why cut him off from his support community? Why imprison him, he's an ex addict, dealing with a life changing situation. Why punish him for for seeking the advantage of hearing in his life which requires it?Was it about the sorry sate of medical assistance in America? He had to sell off all his belongings to address his hearing loss.These questions are never answered and he moves on to the final stage of the movie, reuniting with his girlfriend who unsurprisingly has grown in a different direction during the imposed unreasonable and unexplained no contact rule. This leads to the final moment of silence and clarity, like it was some sort of revelation.The movie seems to think it's giving us some magic insight into something but it doesn't set up the fame work for it to land.Riz does a good job of creating his edgy alternative musician character, although he's essentially a narrow one note kind of person. Highly strung but dealing with it.Olivia's character is a rich girl with a broken family looking for direction through rock, but we don't really get to know her much to understand her motivations or feelings.The award winning sound design was good. They went for the muffled tone rather than the more common tinnitus constant ringing and that's probably a good thing as siting through 90 mins of ringing tone wouldn't have been much fun.It was a well made and acted movie that only half delivered for me.",

            "content": "Quietly building away on an increasingly impressive filmography that first gained traction with cult comedy classic Four Lions and has continued on with important supporting roles in the likes of Nightcrawler, Star Wars: Rouge One and The Sisters Brothers and a notable lead turn in hit HBO mini-series The Night Of, Sound of Metal is the culmination of years of hard work by British based actor Riz Ahmed who delivers one of 2020's most notable individual feats of acting in Darius Marder's hugely impressive feature debut.At one stage rumored to be a directional project for one of the films key drivers/story developer Derek Cianfrance, Metal has finally found its way into the public sphere after years of gestating and the wait is certainly worth it as Marder explores the life of Ahmed's heavy metal drummer Ruben Stone, who seemingly out of the blue finds himself dealing with deafness, shattering his plans in the musical business, driving a wedge between himself and his long-term partner Lou (another nice turn from rising star Olivia Cooke) and bringing up past issues his had with addiction.One of the most all-encompassing films I recall seeing in recent memory when it comes to examining a character dealing with a sudden handicap and an insightful and respectful delving into a world where sound can't be taken for granted, Marder and his on task crew, with special shout outs to all involved in the films sound design/editing and cinematographer Dani\u00ebl Bouquet, help create a stunningly realised world in which Ruben finds himself in that turns from nomadic gig-filled lifestyle to a life on a farm/rehab facility for those with deafness run by Paul Raci's kind-hearted Vietnam vet Joe.In some ways Metal follows a familiar narrative arc of ones journey of self-discovery and acceptance but nothing about Marder's film or Ruben's journey plays out in exactly the way in which you would expect and throughout it refrains from grandstanding moments as it instead focuses on quiet but powerful character interactions and movements that will have you enthralled throughout, culminating in a particularly moving final stretch that is all at once heart-breaking and uplifting.Front and centre throughout this journey is Ahmed and while Cooke and Raci are both on point here, Metal allows Ahmed's naturally charismatic and naturalistic acting style time to shine and its hard to think of a more fully realized performance this year when you sit back and witness and later on ponder the momentous work of Ahmed.Dedicating himself to the role and inhabiting Ruben with a care and grace, despite the troubled souls many failings and flaws, this is a career-defining turn from Ahmed and one that you would hope is a genuine chance at Oscar glory.Final Say -A heart-wrenching and heart-warming drama that is powerfully lead by a once in a lifetime performance from Riz Ahmed, Sound of Metal is a unique drama that overcomes any of its genre trappings to deliver one of the years most memorable and searing offerings.4 1/2 squished donuts out of 5",

While they allow him to hear, the sound is distorted and garbled. Ruben chases after Lou, but realizes that Lou has moved on from him. At the end of the movie, drowning in the distorted sound from the implants, Ruben turns off his implants to embrace the silence.Riz Ahmed's performance in Sound of Metal is empathetic and compelling, and the story grips you at the beginning. I felt that the second half of the movie dragged a bit. I don't really care about Lou. Ruben's learning to cope with deafness was much more interesting. I also feel like for a movie about deafness and sound, the sound design was sadly not very surprising. I think I wanted to see more experimental and creative use of sound design in the movie. I wish sound design could have taken the place of subtitles in the sign language scenes. Could the actors have been dubbed with sound, to allow the hearing audience to experience sign language?

I understand once he lost his hearing, he wouldn't be a particularly happy person, but I never got the sense of watching a musician or a guy with any interesting traits, thoughts or anything that amounts to a living/breathing human. He just became more dreadfully empty once the movie moves to the scenes of him and the main deaf guy. I didn't find their relationship nor any of the scenes compelling whatsoever. No better were the dragging moments between the protagonist and his girlfriend.Finally the movie \"ends\" - I just wanted my 90+ minutes of life back.

Having members of my family that tries to become deaf translator ive heard many stories about living in a deaf community. And the least you may expect is silence, but there youre sooo wrong.

Mine is deafness.\" Marlee MatlinFor those still dedicated to various fictional and documentary depictions of Helen Keller, thrillers like Audrey stalked in Wait Until Dark, families living quiet in The Quiet, and Beethoven, Sound of Metal is another brilliant primer on how being deaf is a curse and an opportunity. Riz Ahmed will be Oscar nominated for his role as heavy metal drummer, Ruben, who loses his hearing for obvious reasons.The world of the deaf comes careening to the audience's senses with the softening of hearing to deafness while Ruben runs the gamut of emotions and Ahmed portrays with uncanny verisimilitude the many forces deafness brings to bear (obviously superior sound design is also crucial to success). I defy anyone not to be moved with empathy for his plight and pleased at his artistry.In the initial stages of Ruben's loss, the drummer goes from concert dynamics to private acquiescence. With the help of singer girlfriend Lou (Olivia Cooke), he eventually seeks medical help. The apex of the drama arrives at a deaf addict camp, where he slowly uses his talent and charm to connect with seniors to children at the next-door deaf school.Ruben becomes a loving friend to many afflicted while at the same time showing his struggle to get out, get an operation, and get back to his music. Not a good idea that last one, for primary in all of his vacillations is to preserve whatever hearing he has left. As always, offering the struggle between forces within is a gift from a gifted actor.Sound of Metal has rich themes that transcend the narrow world of rock drummers: accepting fate, applying new circumstances to greater goals, and not endangering oneself for an elusive temporary boon. Writer and first-time director Marder and co-writer Abraham Marder make sure the hero ultimately must choose his own path, a theme boldly subsuming other patterns.To enhance understanding of the quiet world and Oscar-winning qualities, see and hear Sound of Metal.",

Olivia Cooke really sells her part - I've only seen her in one other movie: Thoroughbreds (which I was really stoked to see, but then didn't like at all. However, she was easily the best part). I didn't recognize her at first, but I was loving her presence from the start regardless. Riz fully wails on the drums, but that's just the beginning - more importantly, he takes you on a very human, relatable, and fully heartbreaking ride as he is resistantly forced to...let go of a lot of things. Paul Raci is also impressively convincing! You will not forget him!Not everyone is going to dig this movie because it is simply too painful. It is an often discomforting film to sit through but that's because it is performed so flawlessly and the content is so real and so heavy. Personally, I felt sad, scared, and nervous through almost the entire film, but I loved it. If you can appreciate a heavy one, this comes thoroughly recommended.

The next day the two drive to the next show, where in the middle of their set, Ruben seemingly loses much of his hearing, throwing him in a fot of panic and helplessness. Ruben visits an optomologist, who cinformes that he's only, got 24% of his hearing left... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell youmore of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll jst have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the feature length directing debut of wrriter Darius Marder (\"The Place Betond The Pines\"). Here he examineswhat happens to a professional musician who faces a career-threatening obstacle, namely a quasi-complete loss of hearing. If you expect a move about heavy metal music, you will be sorely disappointed (except for the initial 5-10 min.), The film focueses on Ruben's options, and how he can reach them. I am not spoiling anything that a good part of the film deals with Ruben \"learning how to be deaf\" (as listed on the daily allocation of tasks in the deaf community where Ruben ends up. We experience te movie's sound as times as Ruben is hearing it (much of it muzzled and incomprehensible), and at times as the regular workd experiences it. The movie is subtitled start to finish. Riz Ahmed delivers a pwerful lead performance as Ruben (he took extensive drumming lessons, and also learned sig language). Olivia Cooke plays Lou. Late in the film there is a small but notewrthy part for French actor Mathieu Amalric (as Lou's father). All in all, I found this fuilm to be a gripping character strudy from beginning to end, and surely one of the best films I have seen this year.\"Sound of Metal\" premiered at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival (yes, over a year ago) to immediate claim, and was supposed to roll out in US theaters earlier this year. Then a little thing called COVID-19 wrecked the movie industry. The movie finally was released in limited cities last weekend for a 2 week run, at which point it will start streaming. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw it turned out to be a proviate screening as I was the only person in the theater. The 12 screen theater looked pretty much like a ghost town, and I honestly don't see how these thaters can continue to opearate like this. Upon leaving the theater, the guy who sold me my ticket asked me how the movie was. Yea, that's how many tickets he had been selling selling that he still remembered me. Meanwhile, if you are in the mood for an exquisite character study of wht it is like to experience being deaf, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",

Splitting someone from his support network is the best plan (he'd been with her for 4 years and clean from heroin for 4 years, so yeah - that's the problem).3. When you don't take the support network along (yes, it's not as big a problem for them on many levels, but I'm sorry - it is a big life changing event for them as well - and you know, they may need support) the outcome is, well, what you get in this film.4. When you have a comedy health system, punish the person who tries to improve their situation. Tell them they are letting down the poor people, or those who don't believe the silence when they try to improve their situation and evict them from the group. Is this to make Americans feel better that they can't get what would be standard care in most countries unless they are rich?).5. Speaking of this, why was the whole community so isolated? Is there intent to live separate from the rest of society. Kinda make the \"it's not a disability\" thing... well, totally untrue.I wanted to like it, but it only made me glad I don't have to suffer the American \"health\" system.",

'Sound of Metal' is one of the best films I can ever remember at doing this (possibly only second to fellow Best Picture nominee in 2021 'The Father'). The sound mixing in this movie is close to perfect. It's nowhere near as simple as just turning the volume up and down in certain scenes. I was incredibly impressed by how it was all done and if the film does indeed take home an Oscar for Best Sound it will be well deserved.Riz Ahmed and Paul Raci have been nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively, at the Academy Awards. Both are indeed terrific. Ahmed is who we follow for the entirety of the film, so it was crucial that he was likeable and relatable, but also troubled and with clearly more going on than the surface would suggest. He finds a really good balance here. Raci is a standout in all the scenes he is in though. He seamlessly commands the room and has you hanging on his every word. His real life dealings with the deaf community clearly came in handy with playing this part. Left out of the nominations was Olivia Cooke. I couldn't go without mentioning her. She is terrific and her snub was very unfair.I liked this film, but I felt like the potential was there to really pull at the heart-strings at certain times in the movie and it never fully took them. I don't look at it as a missed opportunity though, I just think the film didn't want to emotionally devastate its audience as much as it wanted to enlighten and inspire them. I liked the up-lifting elements of the movie the most and if this encourages even one person to go out and learn sign language then everything after that is just icing on the cake.",

During the third act, where he goes to Belgium to reunite with Lou, it dawns on him that aurally the world will never be the same to him, the most painful loss for him is Lou's singing voice and their relationship, to which Marder manages to add a whiff of classism (Amalric has a peculiar cameo as Lou's wealthy father), though their breaking-up scenes overtly avoid stating the obvious. For what it is worth, SOUND OF METAL is so therapeutically conceived and conscientiously wrought that it is far too easier to overlook its foibles (like its commonplace, innocuous treatment of handicapped people, or on a lesser extent, its tedious application of emphasizing the environmental buzzing and humming). Finally, a big shout-out to Ahmed, the heart and soul of the film, fine-tunes Ruben's every predictable step and swerve in such facility and devotion, his first Oscar nomination might not be a pipe dream!\"read the full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",

I like it when movies have strong beginnings and calm endings. But, in this movie, nothing happens in between (Act 2). I did not also understand what it really tries to tell the audience. I now it shows us the deaf community and how Rubert's life changes. But it was just so long and slow that you can't really follow after a moment. I did not also understand Lou.

Among them are Olivia Cooke (Me and Earl and a Dying Girl), who appears to have successfully transitioned from teen indie darling to first-class talent, Mathieu Amalric and especially Paul Raci - whose performance was strong enough to literally create tonal shifts in the film.

Ruben is a former drug addict with a sucidal side who has found salvation in being the drummer of a metal band and being in a relationship with the only other member, guitarist and singer Lou. She has some problems of her own as she had to deal with her mother's suicide and mutilates herself. The couple is on a tour through the United States of America in a van when Ruben realizes that he is losing his hearing. After consulting a doctor, he is told that he has to stop being exposed to loud music and that potential surgery might cost several tens of thousands of dollars and isn't covered by any insurances. Ruben struggles to accept his fate but ultimately joins a rural shelter for deaf recovering addicts. His girlfriend isn't allowed to stay and ultimately returns living in France with her father. Ruben has come to a point in his life where he must ask himself several important questions. Should he accept becoming deaf or try the expensive surgery? Should he stay in the camp or return home? Should he continue his relationship with his girlfriend in France or start a new life in the United States of America?This movie convinces on several levels. The acting performances by Riz Ahmed and Olivia Cooke are excellent. The former portrays a desperate but resilient young man that is easy to empathize with. The latter incarnates a tough young woman with a soft core who is still trying to figure out her identity. The numerous side characters in this movie are also interesting, especially the war veteran in charge of the rural shelter played by Paul Raci who becomes a father figure for the film's protagonist. This film shows that there is always hope in desperate situations and that it's possible to have a decent life even after going through difficult medical issues.Sound of Metal however also has several flaws. The two lead characters face too many struggles at once. Combing borderline personality disorder, deafness, drug addiction, family issues and suicidal thoughts is a little bit overwhelming. The way the heavy metal scene is portrayed in this movie is filled with unnecessary stereotypes. I have been listening to this type of music for several decades and know many friends who have done so as well and nobody we know has any of the psychological troubles shown in the movie. Making loud music doesn't mean that you are trying to fight some inner demons. The message that the female protagonist returns to France and lives with her rich father and now performs boring French piano ballads in the key of Brassens, Brel and Dassin with him makes her happy is quite strange to say the least.In the end, Sound of Metal is a decent drama but portrays the metal scene quite negatively as the story is filled with closed-minded stereotypes. The concept and message behind the movie are very positive but the scripwriters overloaded the characters with personal and psychological issues. The bottom line is that this drama is emotional and engaging but the story could have been more balanced and simplified to make this movie even more efficient.",

None of the pictures I've seen that were nominated this year I liked and this one is no exception.To begin with, Sound of metal is not about metal music at all; I was hugely disappointed with that fact as I'm a big fan of rock music but all I've heard in the movie was some avantgarde screeching sounds made to look like metal but it's absolutely not the case.Second, I totally don't understand why it received an Academy award for Best Sound - the movie is mostly soundless anyway and all we do hear is silence and distant noises from a perspective of a deaf person. Call me crazy but isn't it necessary to have the best sounding picture to be even nominated for it? Because if it isn't then we should have had given Chaplin's City lights the statuette for Best Sound as well at the 4th Academy awards ceremony.But the third and the most important complaint goes to the script - it is featherlight and too simple and it gives you almost no reason to empathize with any of the main characters. The dialogues are pathetic and lifeless and they don't make you feel anything; sure the sounds do place you into the deaf person's shoes but it's the way he wears them that's supposed to stand out and I didn't see it here.Maybe my expectations got in the way of enjoying this movie from start to finish but it doesn't justify its shallow nature and one-dimensional characters and the main thought of being who you are and not trying to be someone you're not is just plain dull. I think 15 years ago a movie of such low calibre wouldn't even be recognized as good enough for any accolades but I guess this is the way the world is now.",

Did this achieve an understanding of deafness by the viewer the answer must be yes.The acting was pedestrian method style in a worthy issue, I remain unimpressed by its lack of emotional variety and there was just no chemistry between Ruben and his girlfriend.The preaching and evangelical approach declaring deafness is not a disability is sustainable in a deaf world, however surprise surprise in a hearing world it is a major handicap. Not to mention in the movie Ruben rejected this community as \"passing\" time and going nowhere. Also I am not sure it anyone spotted it but the leader of the deaf community who was so strident in his viewpoint had a \"hearing\" dog, a dog that covered for his own disability, if hearing was not a requirement in our hearing world he wouldn't have needed a dog. Of course the piano scene in the movie was a demonstration of sound in their hearing community.Overall this movie was much about practically nothing, I did enjoy understanding about cochlea implants.At best this tedious movie is a weak 6 out of 10.",

            "content": "For a long time now I have heard great things about Sound of Metal and with 6 Oscar nominations the hype intensified. But due to the Coronavirus it has only just come to Amazon and I watched it this morning and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a drummer's life changed when he starts to lose his hearing.Main Character\nRiz Ahmed has always been an actor I have liked but I never saw this performance coming as he is absolutely amazing in this role. This is easily the best performance of his career and he truly deserves all the praise that is coming his way. You really see the tragedy of his character as he starts to lose his hearing and you feel a connection with him here and the real life changing journey that he has to go through in the film.Supporting Characters\nOlivia Cooke plays his girlfriend in the film and she is also really good, there relationship is really well presented and you see how they care for each other and react to the situation that he has been put in. She isn't in the film a huge amount but she plays a very key role and she realises that very well indeed. Paul Raci plays a sort of mentor figure to Ahmed and he is also fantastic which is crazy because he hasn't really acted that much over the last 10 years. You can see this is a film and character that was important to him and he gives it his all having an interesting and great chemistry with Ahmed that carries a large chunk of the film. Lauren Ridloff and Mathieu Almaric have small roles and are both good, with Ridloff probably being the most high profile deaf actress that there is, her presence felt appropriate and added some real depth to the project here.Story\nThe story is really good, if you want to watch this film for loads of cool music scenes then you are going to be disappointed. This isn't a film about music, it is a story about one mans journey and how a life changing experience affects him and the others around him and it does an amazing job of that. Riz Ahmed sells it so well and you really see his journey play out and you care so much with an ending that is equally thought provoking and rewarding in its nature.Script\nThe script is really great, the drama is really well presented and handled differently to what you expect from movies with a serious subject matter in there. There are also some nice bits of humour that adds some levity to the whole film and what is going on. Also the film has plenty of sign language and I really like how it was handled and made it something that an audience member such as me would be interested in learning.Style\nThe style is good but mainly the sound design which is incredible. The film does an amazing job of making you feel like you are going through this crisis with Ruben our lead character. The lack of sound and ability to hear other characters is equally uncomfortable and tragic but adds so much depth to the characters and the film. But literally the only thing holding this film back from a perfect score is the pacing, it just drags its heels in at times and the subject is interesting enough but I think a slightly quicker pace at times would have really helped.Overall\nOverall, Sound of Metal is a fantastic film that everybody should see. It's also amazing that this is a directorial debut by Darius Marder so expect a big future from him. This film has to be in contention to win the Oscar categories its in and deserves the two hours it takes to watch.Rating - 9/10.",

            "content": "I'm very wary when it comes to screenplays, specifically when a first-time writer knocks it out of the park because I then find myself having a preconceived notion that they will always be that good. To me, one of the absolute best films of 2012 was The Place Beyond the Pines. Until now, writer/director Darius Marder hadn't really done anything of note since his contribution to the screenplay for that aforementioned film. Well, he has now made a film of his own, both writing and directing, and he's now two for two in my book because Sound of Metal is a fantastic piece of indie filmmaking. Now available on-demand, here's why Sound of Metal more than warrants your time.Beginning with a concert scene that expresses just how passionate Ruben (Riz Ahmed) is about drumming, it doesn't take long before the film sends his life into a downward spiral. Losing his love of music due to his now gradual and rapid hearing loss, Ruben must come to terms with the fact that he may never be able to hear again. Trying to find peace and solace after years of drug addictions, this is the final, and biggest test of his life yet. From the very first moments, I was sucked into this film, but Ahmed's performance also helped with that, because it's honestly one for the ages. I have seen him many times over at this point, but his commitment to this character floored me. There were multiple occurrences, even though I couldn't relate to the character, that I felt the pain he was going through. This also leads me to the use of sound design.From the overly loud opening to the near-silent portions of the film, the sound design was one of the biggest characters here. I have to give major props to the entire sound department. There are times where it seems natural that we would be hearing things the way Ruben is, but then the film shifts back and forth in order to show the difference. On top of that, there are moments where not a single noise or music queue is heard at all, which made for a much more engaging film in my opinion. His performance, along with how the sound design reflected it, was simply perfect.Films that revolve around a likeable character who has to overcome insane odds are very difficult for me to dislike unless it's just poorly made, so I'm slightly biased for stories like these. With that said, as much as a loved this film, I can't quite call it perfect because the portions of the film that were dead silent are both the best and worst parts of the movie in terms of pacing. Yes, I was engaged from start to finish, but the quiet elements sometimes brought the film to a halt. In retrospect, I still enjoyed all of those moments as well, but that, in particular, is what is keeping me from giving this one a perfect score.Overall, Sound of Metal was easily one of my most anticipated films of this year simply due to who was writing and directing. This is the type of film that has talent littered throughout. Whether you're talking about the wonderful central performance by Ahmed, Olivia Cooke's great supporting role, or even the calm and collected performance that Paul Raci gives as Joe, never once did I question the acting here. Although I haven't had the chance to see a lot of editor Mikkel E.G. Nielsen's work, I will absolutely be keeping an eye on him in the years to come, because his work here inspired me. I loved nearly everything about this film and it's easily one of my top recommendations for this year. Sound of Metal is a home run.",

            "review_title": "Sound of Metal (2020, Darius Marder) I sense the message, but I also see a flawed moral stance",
            "content": "'Sound of Metal' is one of the critical darlings of 2020. It has landed on over 50 critics' top ten lists and has been nominated for six Academy Awards. It is directed by Darius Marder who also co-wrote the screenplay with his brother. His most notable project outside of this was writing the Ryan Gosling film 'The Place Beyond the Pines'. 'Sound of Metal' features Riz Ahmed in an amazing performance as the drummer of metal band who loses his hearing and thereby has his entire world turned upside down. This film has some superb elements in direction for not being an extremely directed film if that makes sense. It isn't a story that demands flashy direction, but you still get some very excellent shot selections. The script is well written and wonderfully acted by all. Sound editing is also very apparent as we, as the audience, are privy much of the time to how Ahmed's character Ruben's hearing is functioning in a given scene. While I think this film is constructed well, and executes its intended plot with a great degree of acumen I had a much different experience watching this film than most of the critics who adored it. I struggled greatly with the moral stance the film took and ultimately it made me appreciate this film less.The plot here is fairly simple and straight forward without too much in the way of nuance. Ruben is a drummer in a metal band named Blackgammon along with his girlfriend Lou, played by Olivia Cooke, who fronts the band. Rather suddenly Ruben's world is thrown into chaos when he loses his hearing. Ruben struggles briefly trying to continue to perform but after a visit to a doctor realizes he requires a different path. Ruben is also a recovering addict so there is fear that he could revert to that although it is an avenue that is never really explored. Through his sponsor though Ruben is taken into a shelter for recovering addicts who are also deaf. Many have built a life their and Ruben finds a place of sorts, and learns to start adapting to his deafness rather than just cursing it. Ruben secretly still longs for life with hearing through cochlear implants. He decides to sell everything he owns and get the surgery. Upon discovering this he is turned out of the deaf community as if he is a leper because he is no longer one of them. Ruben's implants are activated and from the first moment his hearing is dissonant and discordant. He journeys to Paris where Lou has become comfortable with her new life as she has reconnected with her wealthy father. Ruben realizes their time has passed and he leaves and the final shot shows him on a park bench, and he takes off the hearing aids and the harsh noise vanishes and he smiles bathed in the now welcoming silence.Nominally I get it. It is trying to impart a message that nothing is inherently wrong with deafness and that only once Ruben embraced his new reality did it look like he was on the path to some kind of inner peace. The problem is that the film seems to take an extremely rigid moral stance against hearing, or more specifically deaf people who seek to hear. I understand that the general principle demonstrated at the shelter that deafness is not an illness or something to fixed is staunchly held by the deaf community and admirably so, but I believe in embracing deafness you don't have to denigrate anyone who feels like wanting to hear like it is a morally reprehensible or evil action. I believe this would be true for anybody, but it is especially true for Ruben who's passion and livelihood was directly connected to his ability to hear. He was ostracized from the deaf community when they learned he had gotten surgery to \"fix\" his hearing. The head of the facility even compares Ruben's behavior regarding wanting to hear again to his addiction. So wanting to regain his lost sense is somehow comparable to heroin use? It would be one thing if it was just that deaf community who treated Joe this way, but the movie also inherently takes that stance as they make it apparent his cochlear implants aren't functioning like he wants them too, and they never revisit the doctor to figure out anything. You are just led to make the decision that the surgery was clearly a poor decision which is rectified when, at the end, he removes the glorified hearing aid presumably accepting once and for all his new and all encompassing deafness. The more I think about about it the more it actually annoys me, and it wouldn't be bad if Ruben came to this decision via free will but instead the movie itself is plotted to make the decision for him. I actually have a friend who had degenerative hearing all his life and got cochlear implants, and never once have I heard him lament that decision. I am all for deaf people feeling included and empowered and concur that the ability not to hear is not the debilitating handicap that most hearing people would perceive it to be, however, this film rather than being a celebration of that life takes a moral stance that places it more in the realm of reverse discrimination as it points a judgmental finger of recrimination. Ultimately I would give this a slightly positive review for the things it does right, but also can only go so far for all the things I believe it fumbles.Eric's Grade: C+",

And there's great character development, and what I love so much is that there's character development up until the final scene. The story is simple enough, but it has a really calm pace to it, which gives it a melancholic vibe. The directing and cinematography also has this melancholic vibe; the whole film had that atmosphere, so if you don't like sad movies, then this probably isn't the movie for you. And the ending is great. I feel like a lot of movies struggle to have a meaningful, emotional ending, but here, the ending is simple and easy to understand. Sound of Metal is a great movie.

That being said, this movie isn't about being a musician, and that's probably why it didn't come off as cheesy or lame. I thought Ruben being four years sober to be a nice addition and almost a necessity to tell this other road to recovery story, that's pretty gut wrenching at times like all good recovery stories are. The acting is superb here, mainly by Riz Ahmed and Paul Raci. I loved Paul Raci in this film... his farewell to Ruben was very heavy and so well acted. It felt like I was watching a documentary. Ahmed was fantastic and really did his homework here. This movie was written for an actor to take home an Oscar, and if Riz Ahmed gets it, it would be very well deserved. Honestly, I think Paul Raci would be a great pick for best supporting actor as well. This is a heavy drama, but a beautiful movie. Some people have issues with the end... well, those people clearly missed the entire point of the movie and have probably never thought about anything in life with any sense of real depth. The ending is beautiful. And perfect. It's a great story with fine acting. Great movie. And I also wanna give a shout out to Surfbort's cameo at the merch table, nice little touch there...

Lou used to cut herself due to past trauma.This setback could push Ruben back to his addiction issues. Cochlear implants may be beneficial but it is not covered by his medical insurance.Possible help comes in the form of a rural retreat for deaf recovering addicts. It is run by Joe (Paul Raci) who lost his hearing in the Vietnam War and became an alcoholic.It means he has to leave Lou behind and lose touch with the outside world. Soon Ruben learns sign language but he wants his old life back.Director Darius Marder serves away from the easy options these kind of dramas take. The film is really a character study about Ruben. You expect that somehow either Ruben or Lou will have a serious relapse.Riz Ahmed gives a mesmerizing performance by utilising his skills of minimal acting. There is a lot of stillness and portraying mood with his eyes.The film does lose touch with Lou and that diminishes the movie when she is not around.The retreat was a strange place. There is a nearby school where Ruben goes to spend time with the children. He learns sign language and he teaches the kids how to drum. I just kept wondering whether all these recovering addicts have been vetted by the police?What was the deal about the people in the retreat not being able to contact loved ones? Ruben and Lou are interdependent on each other and as Ruben mentions, she would have nowhere to go. It turns out that Lou has somewhere to go, but it is thousands of miles away.I did have issues as to why Joe thought Ruben wanting implants was a bad thing. He is trying to mitigate his disability. It is like saying that a man who has lost a part of his arm should get used to the loss of his limb and not get a prosthetic.The film has a coda set in France. Ruben realises that his old life of touring with Lou has gone. Lou starts to become anxious and itch her old wounds when he mentions touring again.The film is left open ended.

The movie uses captions at the bottom of the screen-throughout the whole film-to show a representation of what Riz is experiencing. Riz plays a heavy metal drummer that begins loosing his hearing because of his profession and the gradual way his deafness gets worse and worse is very detailed. Riz actually learned to play the drums and how to use sign language for the role. Olivia plays his girlfriend and the lead singer of their band-which, as far as I could tell, consisted of just the 2 of them. After Riz tries to push through and continue playing with his handicap unsuccessfully, he seeks help from a group that teaches deaf people how to manage using ASL-American Sign Language. Paul is the leader of the group and Lauren is a teacher, and they both try to help Riz learn to deal with his anger. There is another option put to Riz, having ear implant surgery, but it can be expensive-anywhere from 40 to 80 Thousand dollars.It's rated \"R\" for language and nude images and has a running time of 2 hours.Although it is a great showcase for Riz-he is really good-it's not one that I would buy on DVD to watch over and over again.

Its not a perfect film, yet I'm still giving it 10/10 because i enjoyed it very much. Performance by Riz Ahmed was his best one so far. Its a terrific performance that glued this story. Also this film was a superb character study drama. And it also showed us a bit of what its like to loose hearing. Like in \"The Father\", another kinda similar movie in its theme and tone this movie puts you in a shoes of a person with disorder. But while \"Father\" had no light at the end of the tunnel so to speak, \"Sound of Metal\" does have one. When Ruben finally accepted his fate and found comfort in silence, then i knew that this movie has accomplished something great - it left me to believe that that there is hope when dealing with this kind of problem.Overall, \"Sound of Metal\" is a superb movie that works as a great character study movie, superb portrayal of a hearing disorder and even one that is a bit inspirational at the end. As one character putted in this movie - \"you have to learn to be deaf\".",

            "content": "Another film in competition for the Oscars 2021 with a great theme, but rather poorly realized, by an author completely unknown to me, Darius Marder.First of all, let's clear up a few untruths that are presented in the movie, namely, most medical insurances, even in the US, cover operations in cases of hearing loss. Then, the implant placement operation is always performed first on one side, never on both at the same time. And most importantly, couples in such situations are most often encouraged to go through together e.g. Learning sign language, and not being forbidden to do so for some mysterious reason.On the other hand, criticism of the plot, according to which it is illogical for the main actor Riz Ahmed to continue making noise immediately after receiving the diagnosis (a couple of months of rehearsal is not enough to call even the most talented actors drummers), really doesn't stand, because it is natural for each of us, and especially the character as presented in the film, to need time to accept and face the new facts in our lives. It is these moments that are, in my humble opinion, the greatest value of the story. Unfortunately, the film did not go any further than that, and that is also the biggest complaint, because it has obviously long ago become a trend to shoot stories without any messages and conclusions.The biggest praise goes for the supporting female role of Olivia Cooke, who, in addition to inspiring acting, allegedly performed all the music scenes live on her own.In any case, the film deserves a passing grade, unlike some other nominated works, which did not manage to come up with the topics they set out to do. Sometimes it is better no ending at all, than one indulging in the mere commercial taste of the audience, with an extremely illogical plot and maximally stereotypical male characters, using \"subverted expectations\", as in the so-called revenge-feminist \"Promising Young Woman\", which is also in competition. We will see who will do better at the awards ceremony in April.",

            "content": "It sounds strange to talk of the serenity deafness may hold for some, but Darius Marder's new project \"Sound of Metal\" is both a cathartic and stressful insight into the lives of those living without the gift of hearing.Brilliantly channeled by Riz Ahmed, Ruben's rapid decline into silence is a great watch, balancing the abject lows of a drummer losing his gift against someone finding his purpose.Ruben and his girlfriend Lou (Olivia Cooke) have no time to comprehend nor stem his hearing's demise; a brutal wake-up call for both members, throwing their business and relationship straight under the bus.This is not, however, where the story decides to meander: instead, an inspired move to take the characters out of their comfort zones and into a new community is where the plot grabbed me.Riz Ahmed has received serious award attention (and deservedly so), but Paul Raci dominates his scenes. His benevolent but principled mentor role curtails Ruben but still inspires him - not an easy thing to convey on screen in a limited timeframe. His chemistry with Riz is great, propelling the centre of the film and was my favourite element.Deafness is a tricky principle to translate meaningfully to the screen, but \"Sound of Metal\" takes great care with the audio. Silence, noise and music are all core concepts and treated respectfully, and this movie is all the better for it. Furthermore, sign language scenes are unusual but entirely warranted and fascinating to watch. Fortunately, the quality elsewhere is equally high, and the cinematography is itself compelling and uniquely shot.As this year's fairly limp offering of films goes, \"Sound of Metal\" comfortably rises above the white noise of Hollywood dramas we've been inundated with. Don't avoid this movie if you feel like heavy metal will alienate you: it is such a minor part of this film that you will be lost in the compelling characters faster than you can think.",

Maybe I'm just being nit picky and in the grand scheme of the movie none of that stuff really matters too much but it does leave a little to be desired.

It keenly conveys an experience that most members of its audience won't be familiar with, proving that cinema really does have the power to put you in someone else's shoes and promote a proper sense of empathy. It's brilliant to behold. The sound isn't the only good thing about the film, though. The isn't really about being deaf, although that does play a large part in it. Instead, it's about an addict who has to overcome yet another hurdle in his quest to stay sober. The character development at the core of the piece isn't about 'curing' deafness or even overcoming it and that's incredibly important. The piece is really good when it comes to representation, with actual deaf actors and proper use of ASL, which is really refreshing - even inspiring - to see. Ultimately, it's an uplifting affair. Its lead performance is absolutely phenomenal, too. It's a masterfully made character study that's compelling, energetic and, even, quietly affecting. 8/10.",

Riz Ahmed is excellent as he moves through denial and fury and the like with the help of a stern but nurturing father figure.The film has excellent sound design, letting you experience the quick hearing loss and the muted world it leaves behind.It apparently cheats for dramatic effect from time to time - for example, insurance *does* cover the surgery he's desperate for. It also makes it seem like no one is properly explaining anything to the guy, which, like the insurance thing, lets the movie go for big dramatic moments but doesn't ring true.This is a good movie, but outside of the sound design it's a very conventional one that follows a well-worn path with some slight variations.

            "review_title": "Silent Movie",
            "content": "Movies about losing one of the key senses related to the art form intrigue me. Most commonly, from \"City Lights\" (1931) to \"Bird Box\" (2018) or \"The Invisible Man\" (1933 and 2020, among other adaptations), it seems at least, that sense is sight, as motion pictures are primarily a visual medium, but they've hardly ever been entirely silent--not even silent films were silent, accompanied as they tended and tend to be by musical accompaniment and occasional sound effects or live narration. I've been tagging such use of \"sight-analogy\" on Letterboxd, it's such a frequent reflexive device. All the better, then, when art is featured in the picture. In the case of \"Sound of Metal,\" the art is heavy metal music (hence the title, which also takes on something of a double meaning when the protagonist later drums with his palms on a metal slide in a key scene that a deaf child feels, or listens, to). Similarly, this music is not entirely audial, as there is an unmistakable look to the rock scene. Shown stereotypical pictures of how one dresses--what sort of tattoos or blonde highlights, e.g.--one might do well at guessing what sort of music they prefer. Nevertheless, \"Sound of Metal\" is about a drummer who loses his hearing and at least partly because of playing music. The consequence of which is to focus one's senses on the distinctive qualities of the art, whether music or, by extension, cinema.It helps that it's well acted, led by a standout performance from Riz Ahmed and a good supporting cast headed by Olivia Cooke, and well dramatized--even the drug addiction and scratching works--which makes for a nice conflation that the movie isn't just about what's important to art but also what's important in life--there being considerable crossover of both. If this doesn't get an acting Oscar nomination, it better at least get something for the sound. Few films feature such an acoustic focal point. \"The Conversation\" (1974) is an obvious exception, but not to compare this to what's probably the greatest exploration of sound design in film history, it should be indication enough of how good \"Sound of Metal\" is that the comparison even comes to mind. Featuring deaf characters, including some real-life deaf actors, draws attention to the picture's sound design, as well as to the image when the picture becomes silent as well. In general, I especially appreciate the shifts here between subjective and objective camera positions and the accompanying varying degrees of silence and sound and of seeing. The last silent scene is perfect. I don't think a better ending could've been made.",

The movie shortens the way to a Cochlear implant to an online matter of a month or two - at the very least much shorter than the procedure would be in real life. After having used his resources and alienating the people from the church group by choosing to overcome his handicap, rather than accepting the common fate, it turns out to him, that the promise of the surgery is far from true and he can only find peace in silence, since the sound is so unnatural.Throughout the movie, the use of sound and especially muffled sound is very good. Other movies would have made him just act not understanding and hearing things but this way, people get a better idea how it is like. The only thing missing in my home cinema is some bass, so I don't know whether the movie tries to establish some bass sound that tickles the membrane and the belly, since that is something a deaf person should still feel.",

            "review_title": "Makes you appreciate how important our sense of hearing is when so many others don't have it so lucky",
            "content": "\"Sound of Metal\" is a drama film directed and co-written by Darius Marder. Starring Riz Ahmed, Olivia Cooke, and Paul Raci, it makes you appreciate how important our sense of hearing is when so many others don't have it so lucky.After remaining sober for four years, Ruben Stone (Riz Ahmed) travels across America in an RV with his girlfriend Lou (Olivia Cooke) playing the drums in their heavy metal band \"Blackgammon\". One day after performing at a gig, Ruben discovers he has permanent hearing damage from the frequent exposure to loud noises made from his band's music on stage. As it is too expensive for Ruben to undergo medical treatment to restore his hearing, Lou suggests he join a community for deaf people to help him deal with this new handicap. Despite some initial reluctance, Ruben eventually agrees and settles in with a small group of deaf people led by a former alcoholic Vietnam War veteran named Joe (Paul Raci).As we live our lives one day at a time, it is easy to take for granted each of the five senses we have at birth, with our sense of hearing being one of the most important of all. Without it, we wouldn't be able to properly converse with other people or experience some of the wonderful sounds of the world around us. \"Sound of Metal\" clearly aims to remind us of how we should be thankful to still have such a gift as there are many people out there like Ruben who would do anything just to get even a fragment of it back. From the moment his hearing is impaired, we can feel the frustration of what Ruben must be going through, especially considering that he is a musician whose livelihood is based entirely around audio-related matters. The perpetual ringing in his ears and faint vibrations echoing throughout his auditory nerves signify that his days of making music are numbered, and as a result, he is frightened of what lies ahead of him. As someone who has attended several concerts right up close to the front, I can say that the feeling of having your ears constantly ringing for days afterward is not a pleasant one, so it must be unbearable to someone who has to be around loud musical instruments all the time. This film does a solid job of placing its audience into the perspective of those individuals, and it does so in a respectable manner that never feels like it is mocking them or romanticising their plight for the sake of entertainment.Director Darius Marder gives us an authentic look into how deaf people cope with their affliction by not viewing what they have as a crippling disability but instead as a trait a select few are able to find common ground in. We watch as the members of this small community enjoy life through their four remaining senses, like the teaching sign language to hearing impaired children or demonstrating their artistic abilities through activities like drawing. It's nice to see someone like Ruben try to fit in with these people, as when he learns from them, we the audience learn something too. One scene in particular that I really liked was when Ruben showed his rhythmic drumming skills to one of the deaf kids by tapping his fingers on a playground slide they were sitting on. Although the two of them are unable to actually hear anything, the vibrating echoes are more than enough for the both of them to understand how impactful such an impromptu composition truly is. To further prove that the sound doesn't matter, the camera then zooms out to show that the real audio is simply light taps on metal that no one else would otherwise notice, emphasising that their sense of hearing isn't important for living in a moment like this.In a role that suits him well, Riz Ahmed demonstrates both his musical and acting abilities by playing the character of Ruben as an emotionally vulnerable yet strong-willed individual who is determined to not let his deafness define him as a person. Ahmed actually wore auditory blockers in his ears during most scenes of the film to give a sense of realism to Ruben's annoyance at his worsening hearing difficulties and it definitely shows at some points. At first, Ruben stubbornly refuses to take the doctor's advice of avoiding situations that place him near loud noises but as he comes to terms with his hearing loss, he becomes a more humble person over time. Even though this type of character arc is nothing new, it does help draw more attention to the very community it has our hero mingling with throughout the film. Paul Raci did a fine job as well playing Joe, the community's leader who also has his fair share of obstacles to overcome in addition to his deafness. Interestingly, Raci is actually an American Sign Language interpreter in real life so this is a good example of how the filmmakers have gone to a lot of trouble showing respect to the very group of people they made this film about in the first place.Overall, this film has successfully showcased the lives of those whose hearing difficulties are often overlooked by the general public. The very possibility that all of us could go deaf at some point in our lives, whether we're young or old, is certainly a cause for concern. However, what I like most about this film is that it shows we can still live happily in spite of these impairments and people like Ruben are there to remind us that we should always treasure moments like these because it's easy to forget how good things are until they're gone forever. In other words, you only get one pair of ears in life so use them wisely.I rate it 8/10.",

As their form of \"music\" (way to carry on the Hollywood tradition of misrepresenting Metal) and they don't really know how to communicate with one another, deaf or not. Shame, expected far better. Some nice scenes in rehab but that's about it.",

            "content": "The \"misfortune\" of \"Sound of Metal\" is to come so shortly after \"Whiplash\", the film that not only changed the general perception of drums as a background instrument but set the bar very high for music-themed films. I'm sure I'm in no minority if I say that I expected Darius Marder's film to be a companion piece to Damien Chazelle's debut as the story of a man who overcame the progressive loss of his hearing and learned to find his own tempo through the contact between the beater and the cymbals.Why else would you title the film \"Sound of Metal\" after all?I wouldn't go as far as saying there was a deliberate attempt to mislead viewers, I checked the trailer and the line between not saying much and false advertising is never crossed, but \"Whiplash\" left such a vivid mark and today's audiences are so demanding of movies about triumph over the handicap that I wish \"Sound of Metal\" could be a sort of \"Miracle Drummer\". In fact, it's just a straightforward and minimalist drama about a man named Ruben Stone (Riz Ahmed) learning to cope with deafness. That doesn't diminish the story at all but something with the main character being a musician kind of heightened my expectations. The film was good the narrative kind of let me down.Ruben was a heroin addict but lives in a RV with his girlfriend Lou, a singer played by Olivia Cooke. Ahmed is convincing as the street-smart underground itinerant artist, he's not exactly transcending but it's the kind of performances that get noticed when they come from new faces. His acting naturally blends with the intimate style of Marder's camera work that show the couple sharing a detoxicating smoothie, dancing together and discussing life, death and artist resemblances during a road trip across the Midwest. And then the 'everything's fine' chapter is interrupted by Ruben's sudden loss of hearing, that not only isolates him from the rest of the world -including his girlfriend- but forces him to isolate himself further more in order to fix it.I don't want to use the word 'handicap' out of respect for the film's message but I think it contradicts the very purpose of the first act. Marder shows deafness as anything but a handicap, if not medical, at least social in the way it sets obstacles that interfere with the steps of life we take for granted: communicating, working, shopping, hell, even telling someone you've got a problem. On that level, \"Sound of Metal\" is certainly among the best movies to deal with deafness and the sound department did a wonderful job as we could literally 'hear' the stressful silence at time and the more annoying stifled noises, not to mention the echoes and some \"drop the mic\"-like sounds occasionally bursting from the deadly silence. You could feel all the alienation and desperation in Ahmed's acting. And in that ordeal, you've got the sound of metal that resonates a little louder and allow Ruben to 'feel' the sounds and even communicate with one kid in the deaf people community.And yet the film insists that it's not a handicap and to be honest, I'm a little perplex about it.I understand that the film isn't there to make us feel sorry for deaf or hard-hearing people but by focussing on the 'emotional' journey, it kind of lessened Ruben's personal achievements. I guess it's all explained in a very insightful scene where the head of the community, Joe (Paul Raci), a former Vietnam vet who lost hearing during the war, tells Ruben that's it's all in the head, that he lost his family because of alcoholism not deafness. Probably meaning that most troubles we attribute to a handicap are due to our incapability to embrace it as a natural or normal thing that \"happens\" and that can bring new challenges or opportunities in life. I approve that idea, to a limit.It's one thing not to associate handicap with pathos but something that does prevent you from at least keeping on performing your job or having a normal life is handicapping. I don't think \"handicap\" is an offensive word. I have perfect hearing but my lousy vision forces me to wear glasses the size of goggles: when I drive, when I wake up in the dark or I keep my lenses for more than 12 hours, I can say it's a handicap. That I overcame it doesn't make me less envy people who have a good vision. Ruben kind of resigns himself and ends up teaching kids drums, which is a fine character arc closing. But maybe I expected more: Ruben learning to play by memory, be his own drummer, or being tempted to plunge back to drugs, there were many opportunities for the script to push the stakes a little higher but in the end, it's just about Ruben going through the various stages of acceptance and learning the language signs, befriending other kids and their teacher (Lauren Ridloff), collecting money for cochlear implants and meeting Lou again.While the film does make the learning of sign language captivating (it might be the one and only universal language, besides music), its conclusion is emblematic of a sad symptom of today's cinema where films choose the easy way. What lacked in the film was more bravura, the performance of Paul Raci is good but lacks some energy and never rises beyond the proverbial typical tough but lovable mentor-figure. He seems like he doesn't care and at the end we get to some scenes with Mathieu Almaric playing Lou's father as if we were supposed to care. I gather the point was to see her having changed too but I'm sure it could have been better than that depressing French upper class celebration... how about some drums anyway?\"Sound of Metal\" has a deep resonance of its own but as far as posterity goes, I'm not sure about the wavelength.",

Basically, Ruben Stone (Oscar, BAFTA, and Golden Globe nominated Riz Ahmed) is a professional drummer and one half of the metal duo Blackgammon, along with the singer and his girlfriend, Lou Berger (Olivia Cooke). They live in an RV while travelling across the United States to perform gigs. During a performance, Ruben suddenly starts to lose his hearing. He goes to a pharmacy seeking a diagnosis, and the pharmacist (Michael Tow) refers him to a doctor. An audiologist (Rena Maliszewski) performs a hearing test and finds that Ruben can only make out 20-30 percent of words he hears. His hearing will deteriorate rapidly, and although cochlear implants may benefit him, they are highly expensive and not covered by insurance. The doctor suggests that Ruben eliminate all exposure to loud noises and later undergo further testing, but Ruben continues to perform. Lou learns of Ruben's condition and wants to stop performing for his safety, but he wants to continue. Lou is also concerned about Ruben's sobriety, being a recovering heroin addict. With Ruben's hearing continuing to deteriorate, he is taken to and accepted into a rural shelter for deaf recovering addicts. The shelter is run by recovering alcoholic Joe (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Paul Raci) who lost his hearing in the Vietnam War and lipreads. They leave, as Lou is not allowed to live with him, and he only wants to get implants. Lou, anxious for his well-being, leaves and persuades Ruben to return to the shelter. Ruben attends meetings to learn sign language, bonds with the other members, and eventually settles into his new life at the shelter. He also spends time with teacher Diane (Lauren Ridloff) and her class of deaf children to participate in lessons and activities. Despite a shaky start, Ruben eventually finds peace, is comfortable to communicate in silence, and connects with the children and the rest of the community. He gives the children and Diane basic drumming lessons. Ruben's stay has been sponsored by a church, but Joe offers him a permanent residency, as an employee of the community, and tells him to think about it. Ruben periodically looks online to see what Lou is up to, discovering her to be experimenting with her own music in Paris. He gets his friend Jenn (Chelsea Lee) to sell his drums and other music equipment, and sells his RV. He uses the money to pay for the cochlear implant surgery. Ruben asks Joe to loan him money to buy back his RV while he waits for his implants to be activated. Joe refuses, commenting that Ruben looks and sounds like an addict. Joe is disheartened and asks Ruben to leave the community, as it is founded on the belief that deafness is not a handicap. Upon activation, the implants allow Ruben to hear, but the sound from them is heavily distorted and not what he was hoping for. His disappointment disrupts his attempts to regain his old way of life. Ruben flies to meet Lou at the house of her wealthy father Richard (Mathieu Amalric) in Paris where she has settled into a new lifestyle. Richard welcomes him and allows him to stay. Richard confides in Ruben that he did not used to like Ruben, but he recognises that Ruben has made Lou happy. At a gathering, Lou and her father perform a duet, and Ruben's finds that he cannot clearly hear the music with his implants. Ruben and Lou discuss the possibility of playing music and touring again. Lou anxious, but they both comfort each other. The next morning, Ruben decides to go for walk, leaving Lou sleeping. Bothered yet again by the distortion of sounds, he sits on a bench and removes the implant processors from his head, becoming comfortable with the silence. Ahmed gives a highly convincing performance as the former drug addict who finds his sense of sound disappearing and all the life-changing elements that follow, Cooke is good as his devoted girlfriend, and Raci (who learnt to sign because his parents were deaf) also stands out as the community shelter leader. Besides the great performances, and an emotional and authentic story of the devastating impact of someone becoming deaf, this film boasts a brilliant use of sound design, with moments of clever sound flickering and sometimes complete silence, assisted by good cinematography and the score by Nicolas Becker and Abraham Marder, a well-crafted and most watchable drama. It won the Oscars for Best Sound, and Best Film Editing, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, and Best Original Screenplay, and it won the BAFTA for Best Sound, and Best Editing.

Notching up the decibels on the radio and television or trying to understand simple conversations in these masked days of COVID are a few of the tell-tale signs for me and Mr. Marder brings his insightful observations to this dilemma. In his directorial debut, he creates a deaf world by using sign language captioning and modulating the sound from moments of silence to ear-piercing noise. His insightful approach allows moviegoers to become immersed in Ruben's physical crisis. (Kudos to the sound design by Nicolas Becker, a major player in the film's success. His skillful sound mixing takes us into the mind of a person going deaf and reimagines those sounds of silence.) The director also casts his film with mostly deaf actors, bringing an air of authenticity to this movie, even though his nebulous ending fails to complete his storytelling. The compelling screenplay by Derek Cianfrance and the director is filled with dialog that not only informs but draws one into its well-written characters and their relationships.Riz Ahmed plays Ruben. The actor creates a compassionate fully-dimensional character coming to grips with this new physical malady. He is simply terrific in this role. He conveys all the the rage, fear, and heartbreak that his character encounters. One hopes this intense performance is not overlooked by Academy voters. Providing strong support are Olivia Cooke as his loving girlfriend Lou and Paul Raci as Joe, his deaf mentor. (Mr. Raci is an accomplished actor/musician and a CODA, Child of Deaf Adults, and his background of this subject provides the counterpoint for those refusing to see deafness as a handicap.)The issue of hearing loss and its impact are never sentimentalized in Mr. Marder's movie. We watch Mr. Amhed's emotional performance as he travels to the beat of a different drum. And so does this riveting film. (GRADE: B+)",

Darius Marder and Abraham Marder's exquisite screenplay is the absolute standout, at the same insanely good level as Riz Ahmed's impressive performance. The former holds a meaningful, enlightening story about not only the deaf community but also about accepting our limitations as something that's a part of us instead of taking it as a handicap. Except for a couple of unnecessary scenes that could have made the movie a bit shorter, the two-hour duration is quite fair, boasting a very captivating narrative.Countless storytelling technical details elevate this film into one of the best of the year. From an apparently simple yet extremely clever use (or absence) of subtitles for sign language to emotionally compelling dialogues, an outstandingly realistic atmosphere surrounds the movie throughout the entire runtime. Never, not even for a second, the viewer needs to deal with an over-the-top reaction, cheesy conversation, or a typical Hollywood, overdramatized moment. Darius Marder has terrific control of the tone, keeping it exceptionally grounded.Riz Ahmed delivers what I believe is his career-best display, incorporating his character's hearing disability in a seamless fashion. His subtle facial expressions and body movements are essential for the performance that can easily guarantee him dozens of nominations. Olivia Cooke (Lou) is also excellent in her role. Technically, huge praise to Dani\u00ebl Bouquet's cinematography, which insists on an almost documentary-style composition by applying standard camera angles and shots often seen in this type of feature, helping to generate the before-mentioned authenticity.One of my absolute favorite films of 2020.Rating: A",

A life where you will find yourself, your true self, you will start to feel every little detail around you, you will start to be grateful, you will see things differently, you might start to like things that you always thought that you might not like. Being deaf or blind or whatever doesn't mean your life stops or ends there, it doesn't mean that something is wrong with you, it doesn't mean that you can't do anything. You don't have to fix it, you just have to fix your \"MIND\" if you think that way. THIS IS SOUND OF METAL and that's why I love this film. The film is about life, love, accepting & loving your life whether it was good or bad, being grateful, feel and absorb everything and every moment around you and never give up.Sound mixing & Sound editing were perfect. Alongside Ahmed's great performance, the sound mixing & sound editing were showing exactly how Ahmed's character Ruben Stone, hears every single thing around him. It is like we the audience, are Ruben Stone. We are feeling what he is feeling and hearing what he is hearing. Loved how sometimes everything goes completely silent where we don't hear any single noise, and sometimes we hear everything that's going around him. The film shifts back and forth through that to show the difference. Hats off to everyone in this department who worked on it and got us this beautiful result.In addition, The directing & cinematography were absolutely amazing, they were portraying the different aspects of Ruben Stone's life in a creative and unique way.The film has a very great screenplay that is very well written. Some scenes will really touch your heart and they have a really deep meaning behind them. The film is also filled with quotes about life that are really deep.Riz Ahmed's performance was amazing and he was able to play Ruben Stone very very well. Really can't imagine someone else other than him to play Ruben. I really don't know what to say much about his performance other than, IT IS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE YEAR. Although Olivia Cooke did not have much time on screen, she was able to give a great performance as well.In conclusion, Sound of Metal is one of the best movies I have ever seen, I \"HIGHLY RECOMMEND\" every to watch it as soon as possible. It is new, unique, creative, emotional, genuine. It is just everything.My rating is: 8.5/10.",

This story, however, revolves around the loss of hearing and the reason it works particularly well is because while it could have been any degree of loss, it was extremely foundational to the protagonist, as he is a musician, so the loss of hearing is one that particularly ruins him.While I won't go into any further detail, as to avoid spoilers, I will say that the resolution this film provides is particularly heartwarming and provides a particularly resonating ending to this story.

The bumps and knocks that his muffled ears hear add soo much to the design.I like the messaging of his desire not being what he actually needs. Meaning his job as a drummer, and Lou, his girlfriend, are the reasons he wants his hearing to come back. But along the way of trying to live without hearing. He finds peace and happiness. As a theme, i think it works very well and i think its a very good message for disability not being a curse for life. He is taught that being deaf isnt whats most important, being happy and happy with yourself is. No matter if you have a disability or not.The film also stresses at points the idea of you have to want to better yourself for yourself and not external factors. I think it got it point across well and gave Ruben a good arc, with him finally having a moment of peace with no hearing aid.I like this film alot and i'll probably watch it again soon. The acting was pretty good. No one felt fake. The cinematography isnt very interesting but the characters and focus on the sound kind of covered up for that.Good film. Watch it.",

            "content": "Movies have the power to give a perspective we might have no ability to understand. Much like the fantastic The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (2007) gave viewers a chance to experience life through the eye of a paralyzed man, Sound of Metal (2020) was a revelation into the life of a musician who suddenly goes deaf. There are so many aspects to sudden deafness that Sound of Metal provided insight to that opened my eyes to the struggles of this particular disability. Of course, while this is the obvious takeaway from this film, the meaning is much deeper than that.Ultimately, the twist Sound of Metal gives to the deafness narrative is the power of addiction. It's encouraging to see positive handling of previous addiction through accountability, but it's even more striking to see how addictions can take many different forms. Whatever gives us dopamine, we can become addicted to. While not as in-your-face as Requiem for a Dream (2000) is with the dangers of addiction, Sound of Metal is subtle with the lesser-known addictions. I never knew someone could become addicted to a person, let alone to the simple ability to hear.Of the Oscar nominees this year, Sound of Metal is certainly the most artistic. The cinematography was very deliberate to show the moments of quiet, but the sound design made all the difference in delivering the emotional impact of hearing loss. You don't realize how much hearing affects your life until you can watch a man struggle with not having that input while also \"hearing\" what he does (which isn't much). If Sound of Metal has one fault, it's that the focus on the art meant the story was a little simple. Sure, there are layers to its moral, but they all end up focusing on the same thing.A revelation into the life of someone who suddenly loses their hearing, I give Sound of Metal 4.5 stars out of 5.",

They have a tough but very happy life together, making music, touring, and loving. This all comes to a stop when Ruben, the drummer, loses his hearing. Their lives become completely unravelled. Ruben gets help but he must still figure out how he's going to cope with the change.The story was very compelling at first. I was totally hooked into what Ruben would do. How would he cope with this problem which would completely upend his life? It was a tough sad story. It took a while to realize that Ruben could not go back to the life he once had with his girlfriend Lou, no matter how badly he wanted. The school he went to built him up but they also were strict. It seemed very fundamentally Christian in a good way and in a negative way too. It built up a support network but it took away many basic choices from the individual. It was a very limiting experience and not for everyone.There was much of value in this movie. The use of sound especially was amazing. The visuals were quite solid and the acting was understated and quite lovely. The only problem was that about midway through the movie until near the end, at the school, the pacing just dragged. It was not an exciting way to tell it. There were too many dead moments - things that could have been either shortened up or made more interesting. It's a tough situation - to get an idea of Ruben's isolation and sparseness without making things boring.Riz Ahmed is absolutely stellar in this movie - he's so grounded and believable. Rather than get too emotional, he seems to struggle to contain his emotion and this makes his story even more heartbreaking and believable. Olivia Cooke is also brilliant and a good match to Ahmed. The movie was not nearly as interesting when she wasn't in it. The dynamics of Ruben and Lou were really the core of the movie. It was a beautiful life but it could no longer continue - how painful is that?",

Really a person should never take anything for granted. The movie is the story of Ruben(in a well done performance from Riz Ahmed) a hard living addled drug abusing heavy metal drummer who all of a sudden finds his life and world turned upside down once he starts to lose nearly all of his hearing. As the nightly grind of the loud beat and pounding of the drums in after dark clubs has finally caught up with him.This film is more than about loss, it then goes on a journey of dealing with one's new way of life and frame of mind. This really is a tribute to the deaf as Ruben finds out when he goes to a deaf and hearing loss camp that he now has to learn sign language to communicate. It really is a struggle and new go for him, the film is brash and to the point with this, yet at the same time it portrays the pain and grief that Ruben feels. Plus this film is a journey of love and feeling as Ruben still continues his love life joy with his gal pal Lou(Olivia Cooke).The way that sounds are showcased in this film is top notch from the hard and loud pounding of drum metal to the static and unclear new world of silence and hearing loss that Ruben deals with the way the scenes were crafted happens to be fine showcasing of polar opposite worlds. Really watching this film you will learn to love and respect what you have as you will not take anything for granted as it shows aspects of how life can change from the norm. Overall watch this film for it's harsh gripping look at loss and new acceptance.",

For a musician losing the most important tool is such a tragic event. Riz Ahmed who portrays Ruben, well represent the enormous torment that he needs to go through, and he is never able to accept his condition, even if for a moment seems to embrace his new reality. The main character will try to return to his previous life, but the price that will pay on a personal level, will be very high. Definitely not the average movie with an happy ending and a pretty realistic take on becoming deaf: an event that will change forever every single aspect of life, and how different people can cope with it.For almost the entire movie there is no music. This is a very nice choice by the director, as it will highlight even more the trauma felt by the protagonist. The audience will \"lose\" the hearing together with Ruben: for most of the time we will hear distorted and muffled noise, creating a sense of confusion. Most of the time things said by actors are pretty much incomprehensible, and I felt a sense of isolation and powerlessness. It is really easy to identify with Ruben and to really care about him. I felt really sorry and I root for him until the very end, hoping that he could find happiness with his new life.The acting is extremely good and I really enjoyed Paul Raci as Joe, the owner of a community of deaf people, trying to guide and make them find purpose in life, by teaching valuable lessons. Such an expressive and emotional performance, definitely a talented actor and a good discovery. Riz Ahmed completely nailed the part, absolutely an amazing performance, he was definitely able to show his skills. Really hope that in the future we can see him on more main roles, because he definitely deserve it.Amazon is releasing very good stuff in latest years, and I really hope to see more from them.

Definitely amongst the better films of the year, it is a riveting & reverberating story of passion, addiction, acceptance & rediscovery, and is rendered on screen with both compassion & consideration.Co-written & directed by Darius Marder, the plot concerns a drummer who begins to lose his hearing and keeps the audience in close proximity with the protagonist at all times so they can relate to his agony & frustration as he comes to grips with his inevitable fate while also offering a much welcome insight into the experience of the deaf community, all of which is portrayed with deft care & understanding.One of the technical highlights of the film is its sound design. At times an assault on the senses and deliberately so, it really familiarises us with the feeling of what it's like to lose one's hearing, the invaluable perks of silence, and the harsh reality of cochlear implants. As for the performances, Ahmed brings his character to life from inside out, steals the show with what's undeniably his career-best work, and is brilliantly supported by the rest.Overall, Sound of Metal is a consistently engaging & emotionally gripping drama that rides rather heavily on Riz Ahmed's outstanding acting & complete devotion to his role. The characters, including the protagonist, are far from fully fleshed in the script but the energy & commitment the actors bring to their respective roles nonetheless help steer the story past the finish line. An auditory revelation led by a star-making turn from its rising talent, Sound of Metal is a definite must-see.",

Ahmed delivers on all of this superbly and does a fantastic job of keeping attention glued to him the whole way through. The sound work is spectacular as well, really driving home the auditory issues at play here.Possibly my favorite thing though is Marder's willingness to linger and let the actors do the work rather than expositing all over us. The ending is a perfect example of the negative space in a conversation really informing everything. He achieves so much without saying anything which is so perfectly befitting a film of this nature. Going in and finding out they actually utilized people who are actually deaf makes me love it all the more and gives the film an even greater sense of agency.Strong recommend for everyone, especially those looking for a stunningly acted drama about redefining the sense of self.

Gig done, the drummer notices that something is wrong with his ears. No tinitus but his hearing was fading away. And after a terrible gig he hadto admit something is really going wrong with him. From there we are focused on the drummer and his way to start living with being deaf. Not easy for a musician but the manager sends him to a place for deaf people. From there he had to amke a decision. Living with it or getting medical help.What happens next is out there on prime video to see.

It would have been more interesting to hear something that sounded great combined with the dynamic of hearing loss and growing into that environment. However, i left wanting to be deaf at the beginning and the end of the film.As far as character development goes, in many instances, the dialog seemed random or confusing. I did find throwing the viewer into a deaf community daunting and impactful. But the filmography and script felt low budget and other than learning some new signs, I didn't feel attached to any of the characters.By the end of the film, it was interesting to hear a representation of what hearing aids can sound like in a noisy room and it clearly demonstrated a point made earlier about quiet moments...which is why the sudden ending was both artistic and as empty as the silence that preceeded it.I really thought the movie was going to be more about overcoming obstacles and making a difference in ones self and others. It's not. It's more like what happens if you're asked to make a movie about hearing loss and coming to terms with it and instead smoked pot through the whole filming of it.",

We hear the muffled treble of his surroundings as his hearing progressively disappears. We hear the warped, radio-like fizzle of his cochlear implant as he readjusts to a world with sound. It's a profound experience. The scenes at the deaf community home is also a masterclass in directing scenes without any dialogue.

Here he plays a drummer to his vocalist girlfriend, played by the equally talented Olivia Cooke, who after one show he discovers he has sustained permanent hearing loss. Panicking, he books an appointment at a doctor's office to give him his options (the one he responds to is a cochlear implant but the price for the operation runs anywhere from 20K to 80K & his insurance doesn't cover it, sound familiar America?). A recovering drug addict who is reaching the limits of his sobriety (he's been clean for 4 years), Cooke reaches out to his sponsor who diverts them to a secluded farm estate where a bunch of recovering addicts (who also are hearing impaired) reside led by a tough yet kindly caretaker, played by Paul Raci (in a marvelous turn). Ahmed now has to relearn things most of us take for granted since he can still speak but his command of sign language is non-existent prompting him to enroll in a class made up of young kids w/him (all tat'd up & sporting a bottle blonde top) being the obvious odd man out. Cooke leaves him behind fearing they'll both get into bad habits making Ahmed's progress slow but sure. Once reemerging as a functioning member of society he never quite embraces the 'stillness' which Raci implores him do & instead sells off all his worldly possessions (his RV & all of his sound equipment) in order to go ahead w/the surgery. When he reunites w/Cooke in Paris (she's spending time w/her estranged father, played by Mathieu Amalric, also a musician), Ahmed must come to grips w/where his life is now finally finding the peace he's hoping to get. Wonderfully nuanced (mimicking his hearing loss we get passages where nothing is heard on the soundtrack) w/Ahmed the eye of the hurricane as it were, the film lives or dies on his shoulders & he carries it like a champ w/vivid support from what I presume are a bunch of hearing impaired, non-actors (I did see Lauren Ridloff from the Walking Dead playing a teacher at Ahmed's school) giving the entire affair a degree of legitimacy.",

Overall, the movie is about how he has to relearn to navigate everything. The entire cast turns in some fine performances.This movie got nominated a year before \"CODA\", also focusing on deafness and music. Both are outstanding movies. A noticeable difference is that \"Sound of Metal\" has no soundtrack so as to keep the focus strictly on the characters. This made it one of the most effective movies that I've seen in focusing on disabilities. All in all, I hope that in the future, more movies focus on disabilities.",

Not many.My Story (Review Below)\nI lost my hearing in my right ear in my early 30's. Some weird thing they can't cure called Meniere's Disease. 20 years later and three months ago, my good ear started crapping out and I was told I have bi-lateral Meniere's. Not good.I wasn't a drummer (practiced to be one though). I went to metal/rock shows before COVID, and I wear ear plugs now when I go. I can't personally speak to what it's like to be in the music business, but I can speak to what it's like to go deaf all of a sudden.Just as in the movie, I wake up and hear a loud humming with everything else a dull murmur. Even my own voice.I was told hearing aids could help -- I was lucky that I had a family benefactor who offered to pay for the best of the best as they are not covered by insurance.And they helped -- a little, but for the price they barely did squat. Sounds were shrilly like you had an AM radio with a bad speaker in your ear. I need to put subtitles on all movies I watch these days.But having trauma in your life reminds you of the importance of connections. Friends and family that support you, or people you barely even know -- like my Letterboxd friends in the comments section. What a great community we have here.Sound of Metal Review\nI went in without reading the byline, expecting an expose on life in the hard rock music business. Instead it's a tragic situation of the young drummer of a metal band, played fantastically by Riz Ahmed, who goes deaf.The acting is fantastic. Riz Ahmed is great as usual but reaches a new level . His girlfriend Olivia Cooke is unrecognizable with the bleached eyebrows, moving refreshingly from trash horror movies to a fantastic dramatic effort.There's more to say but I need to digest this more and possibly do a rewatch.Amazing.",

He suddenly loses his hearing and has to deal with the profound consequences of that to himself and his life. There are few dramatic films dealing with deafness, let alone a sudden affliction, so on that point alone this is a refreshing change, and the film genuinely does try to immerse the audience into the disturbing soundless world he enters and his struggles to deal with it; here the film should be lauded for superb sound design and equally impressive editing. It's a vividly told story and an informative journey, especially if like me your knowledge of the deaf experience is limited. Although I couldn't in the end quite warm to the main character, perhaps that's a strength of the film - thus avoiding sentimentality. Highly recommended.",

It's a premise that in so many ways could have led to a film going the usual sorts of Hollywood routes, but the storytelling from director Darius Marder is nuanced, and the pace he sets is fantastic. We feel this character's emotions as he tries to process this dramatic change in his life, but we're never hit over the head with expository speeches or grand scenes that resolve things in black and white ways, which was something I really liked about the film.That subtlety is perfectly matched by the performance Riz Ahmed gives, which is one of the best I've seen in a long time. Some of his finest acting is in little moments, just as some of the best scenes are filled with silence. Olivia Cooke and Paul Raci are very strong as well, and the scenes they have with Ahmed in the second half of the film are quite powerful. There is so much genuine feeling being expressed, with love and empathy being counterbalanced by the realization that life changes, and that it's hard to recapture the past or to be truly content in the stillness of the present. Throughout it all, the superb sound design helps immerse us into the experience. Just a very well done film in every respect, including its ending, and one I might have given an even higher rating.",

The concept alone sounded intriguing and having two talented actors like Riz Ahmed and Olivia Cooke as part of the cast got me excited.Sound of Metal follows Ruben, a heavy metal drummer whose life changes forever after the loss of his hearing.I thought this film was absolutely fantastic. In his directorial debut, Darius Marder constructs such a beautiful yet harrowing drama. This is a film that really made me feel something. Seeing Ruben's battle and struggle towards his hear loss made me realise just how important our senses are to us and losing any one of them can impact our life to a great extent. The sound plays an integral part in the film and is easily one of the strongest factors. From the loud heavy metal music at the beginning to the muffled vibrations and speech, the sound design perfectly puts us into the shoes of Ruben and helps us get a full understanding of what it's like being deaf. If this film doesn't win Best Sound Editing and Mixing then I don't know what will. The pacing may be slow for some but I was consistently enthralled by what I was watching. It was interesting and even educational to see how the deaf community, which I believe were portrayed well, live their lives without being able to hear.This is the best I've seen Riz Ahmed act. I could feel his pain during his heated moments and even during the silent scenes, where the camera would just focus on his face, the expressions he would give communicated so much about the way his character was feeling. He carries the entire film as he's practically in every scene and I hope he wins some awards for his work here. In collaboration with the amazing sound design, this is the most empathetic I've felt towards a character in a long time. Darius and Abraham Marder leave small hints about Ruben's past which allowed me to align with him further. Olivia Cooke isn't in the film as much I thought but she did a great job playing Lou and there was enough context given for me to understand what her character was like. Paul Raci was remarkable as Joe. He's an actor that I would definitely like to see more often.I really loved Sound of Metal. It's a expertly crafted film with so much heart, care and emotion put into it that ends in a way that spoke levels to me. Riz Ahmed proves once again how talented of an actor he is and I'm looking forward to what Darius Marder makes next.",

Hearing is such a fragile thing, and once it's gone, it's gone forever, so seeing the character of Ruben come to terms with that was incredible.As for Riz Ahmed's performance, it was nothing short of extraordinary. You feel his initial anger and confusion, and as his character grows, you find comfort and peace in his silence. It's an emotional rollercoaster as his journey teaches us more about the deaf community and how to live without hearing.The supporting cast all do a great job, especially Paul Raci as Joe. But the subplot with Ruben's girlfriend, Lou, did nothing for me. Their relationship was touching, and they have their moments, but I just didn't care for their love story/the tour subplot. I just thought that Ruben's personal journey of learning to live without hearing was more interesting when he was figuring it out on his own.I was actually blown away by the sound design, which is not something you usually hear in movies. (Pun intended.) Since hearing is such an important part of the film, they use it in so many creative ways. There are even long sections without any words ever being spoken, which made for a more immersive viewing experience.On the other hand, the movie can run a little long at 2 hours. They could have probably shaved off like 20 minutes, mostly to do with the girlfriend/tour subplot. But with such an immersive sound design and an excellent performance from Riz Ahmed, this would have definitely made my Top 10 Movies of 2020 list.",

It is deeply gratifying to see a mainstream film that doesn't take it for granted that deafness is a disability and that cochlear implants are a \"cure.\" On every single aspect of production this film is committed to messy reality. Even Joe's harsh reaction to the implants-plausible but not common-is entirely within the realm of how people actually behave. With that said I think the movie is about addiction not deafness.Ruben's arch is learning how to sit still; that is learn to accept the hardships life throws at you without engaging in self-destructive behavior. It is a hugely important aspect of this script that the implants are not treated as a good-you can argue that Ruben harmed himself with them. I think eventually he learns this lesson but it is really touch and go there for awhile. The film has a great unresolved-that is not everything has a bow on it-quality that adds to the messy reality the film is going for. As such this is an emotive powerful work.This complexity is supported by all the formal elements of filmmaking. The script is efficient piece of storytelling. The direction is assured without being obtrusive. And above all the sound design of the film places the viewer in the headspace of person with hearing loss and cochlear implants. It is deeply effective and effecting.Much credit must be given to Ahmed. He turns in a performance that is completely real-he is electric and subtle. He carries the big moments and the quiet ones. He is completely vulnerable and open. The film is carried by Ahmed and sound; Ahmed does his job perfectly.But speaking of acting Raci is sneakily good. He has maybe 20 minutes of screen time but he is so real and strong that you totally get the where the character is coming from. Like much of the film he is just alive.This could have been a dull Important Subject Movie. Instead it is a living piece of cinema that allows everyone to step into Ruben's shoes.",

However, Darius Marder's script makes a simple case out of an extraordinary story, seemingly belittling the complex and unique vision it has the potential to be- with a simple, formulaic narrative that we have seen many times before. I enjoyed this film, it wasn't the most entertaining film i've seen, but it did have very interesting moments throughout. It's a dark, sometimes brutal feeling film, and its raw emotion is often encaptured and amplified by these performers on screen. Ahmed is obviously the standout, as well as Cooke, but Paul Raci and Lauren Ridloff also deserve some attention for their work as well. The film feels a bit bland to look at, an attempt at a grounded setting maybe, but it just feels to dull and gray, and therefore depressing to watch, when it could have simply been hard. I enjoy many things about the film, the way it focuses on sound to tell its story of our lead character is very unique, but the story it tells is unfortunately just average. Not bad, but average, and the pacing from Marder's script doesn't make it much better. In the end, Sound of Metal is far from a missed opportunity, and it has many excellent and unique qualities, as did Marder's other film The Place Beyond the Pines. However, it's just not daring enough to be something truly worthwhile, and although there are many strengths, that disappointment still leaves with you by its end.My Rating: 7/10.",

After a boisterous, mid-tour set, one half of a power duo starts to experience aural malfunction. Uh-oh.In typical human nature denial, Ruben carries on, but is soon forced to make tough decisions. Scrambling desperately to get back on course, and continue his career, Ruben is eager to gamble on an expensive operation, while his vocalist girlfriend steers him to a recovery community, focusing on adaptation over cure.Reuben's journey, careening between hope, desperation, struggle and revelation, is a fascinating one, amplified by the extraordinary presentation from director Darius Marder. Putting the audience in Reuben's ears, the loss experience through muffled passages, jarring distortions, and worst of all, total silence, is devastating. The eclectic sound design may be the star here. Closed captioned throughout so nothing is missed, the sub-titles, usually a distraction, become a fluid part of the viewing experience.As a simple, uncomplicated young man jolted by a life altering shock, Riz Ahmed is terrific in a subtle yet demanding role. He absolutely rocks as a kickass drummer, a reluctant deaf student, and an empathetic partner willing to go any distance to make things right. The buzz about this film is not just in Ruben's ears.hipCRANK",

            "content": "Let me just say this right off the bat, Riz Ahmed is a revelation here. For someone who isn't a deaf person in the real world, he accomplished an incredible feat, did an amazing job in the illustration of the same. So did Olivia Cooke; people might have not been much appreciative of her performance here, but one must agree that despite her lesser screentime, as compared to our main lead I.e. Ruben, she does make a solid impact.At the end of the day, it's all about Acceptance. The true realisation of the actuality, irrespective of the harshness and gravitas of the same. Now the people who have been rather harsh on the film, need to understand that this is not here to satisfy your needs for 'Entertainment', nor has it been made to give the audience the traditional vibes of a musical drama; it is rather structured like a lesson, sort of a compass to all those people who feel lost and going through comparable phases.If you speak strictly from a cinematic stance, several flaws can be brought up, not regarding any of the technicalities though, as those have been pretty impressive and probably the strongest suits apart from the enactments. Nevertheless, if you ask me, that's not how your approach should be this time. You shall go in with an open mind (and lots of patience) to truly comprehend the significance underneath.I'm no musician and I'm not somebody whose livelihood depends upon the ability to hear. Regardless, the lone thought of losing my hearing terrifies me to the core. Lately, I have experienced Mild Tinnitus (due to ETD). For those couple of days, I felt nothing but hopeless, the persistent buzzing inside my head, all the discomfort in my ears made me angry, I was worried sick. Through a handful of medications and some exercises (Yoga), I'm now in a much better shape, almost healed, but I'm still very much in fear of getting the ringing once again.I couldn't possibly imagine what goes through those people who underwent permanent hearing losses, or those who are currently on the way to losing theirs. It's awful, it's tragic, yet the harsh reality is we have to make peace with our condition and must move on. Cause, Life stops for nobody, it goes on and we have to make our adjustments accordingly, that's what this story aims to teach. At first, it would be tough to cope with your situation knowing that your life would never be the same, but you have to fight no matter what life throws at you. These are the lessons, this specific narrative cares to dissipate.",

            "content": "I can't believe I missed watching this gem of a film. Riz Ahmed's terrific performance as a drummer who suddenly goes deaf is uplifted by the screenplay (by Darius Marder andAbraham Marder) that immediately draws you in, and a fantastically immersive sound design which makes you experience what the protagonist is going through. The tender chemistry he shares with his girlfriend Lou (Olivia Cooke) is beautiful. The screenplay incorporates several scenes that leave a silent-yet-poignant mark on viewers, and director Darius Marder saves the best scene for the very end. It's so subtly impactful - and it doesn't need a single line of dialogue. We travel with Ruben on his journey from becoming deaf to trying to avert that with implants, learning to live with his disability, and the realizations that eventually follow. The edit work (Mikkel E. G. Nielsen), detailing the sounds that constantly take us in and out of Ruben's head, is tremendous.Perhaps, the struggle-filled journey (with occasional, momentary joys) lasts a lot longer than a few months, as is showcased in the film. But the entire crew treat the subject of disability with much-needed sensitivity, portraying the members of the shelter as never seeking an ounce of sympathy. Also, I wish music had a larger role to play role here, especially since the very thing that Ruben is good at, is taken away from him probably during the peak of his career. If you're looking for a single good takeaway from the film aside from its performances and technicalities, it's how there's inexplicable beauty in silence. Sound of Metal deserves all the praise (and the Academy Awards) it has gotten!",

My biggest complaint was the fact that his onset of symptoms was so sudden. This felt like something that would be more gradual in real life, but either they compressed time significantly or he just went deaf almost instantaneously. Despite that minor issue, I felt like I was in his shoes throughout the film, and understood exactly why he was getting so frustrated. The performances were all great, in particular Riz Ahmed did a marvelous job with all the emotional stuff he went through. I think what impressed me most was how this movie didn't go in certain obvious directions that I expected. There were some frustrating tropes that I anticipated, and the movie didn't fall into any of those cliches. I think the most interesting aspect of the film was the sound design, because the sound technicians did a great job of simulating the way the main character would hear things. It was so well done that it felt was jarring whenever they switched to normal audio. The conclusion itself was done perfectly, and I was overall satisfied with the film. I can't say that Sound of Metal was all that groundbreaking or legendary, but it was a solid movie that I'd gladly watch again.",

            "content": "When directors make movies about disabilities, they often tend to pull on the emotional strings of the audience by turning the film into a melodrama. Sound of Metal is different. It is not a sobby story about a deaf person but a character study which tackles the aspects of life that people don't often think about when it comes to deafness such as heartbreak, denial and the ultimate acceptance.While it is a challenge to make the audience truly resonate with an experience of being deaf, Darius Marder manages to masterfully accomplish just that. Through a skillful manipulation of sound, the viewer can slip in and out of the deaf state to experience the maddening sensation of losing the ability to hear and the emotions that come with it.In order be an impactful film, the technical aspect must be supplemented with poignantly realistic acting and Riz Ahmed aces his role. Being a young musician, the ability to hear is what defines his life and the devastation which he goes through can be felt in every scene. He is scared, angry and confused all the same time as he struggles to accept his new reality.The three arcs of the film are perfectly fleshed out as each one has a distinctive theme, message and atmosphere that stirs up different thoughts and feelings. While tragic in nature, the movie has it's share of sweet moments which show that deafness is not the end of life. Personally, I kept thinking whether I would have managed to accept losing my hearing and learn how to live in my new world. It's not often that a movie pushes me to think about such life-altering decisions and if that is not a sign of a great film, I don't know what is.movies.shmovies on Instagram",

            "content": "There are few things that are more debilitating for a musician than losing one's hearing. Here, a hard rock drummer, Ruben (Riz Ahmed) is a member of a two-piece band with his guitarist/singer girlfriend Lou (Olivia Cooke). He wakes up one morning practically deaf. Ruben reacts like most immature impulsive head-bangers would - he freaks out. Lou can barely contain her boyfriend's anger long enough to tell him she's found a facility that can help him cope. The community for the deaf is run by Joe (Paul Raci) who's plain-spoken, kind, but firm. When Ruben enters he's still a bucking bronco who just wants to \"fix\" his problem and get back to his music and Lou.Director Darius Marder and his brother Abraham's script essentially follows the pattern of an ailment/rehab film (shot on 35mm!), even with such an unusual character at it's front. It's to their credit - and the actors' - that it becomes so affecting. Ahmed's performance builds as the movie progresses -- just like his character. Cooke is solid and saves some of her best for later in the film, as well. But, it's veteran actor Raci who becomes the heart and soul of the piece. Raci's own parents were deaf and he brings a delicacy and intuition to the role that goes far beyond what was on the page. He exhibits tough love, but with genuine feeling. The always welcome Mathieu Amalric is a nice presence as Lou's Belgian father.The on celluloid lensing by Daniel Bouquet captures the Boston settings well and the music is appropriate even when it's abrasive. The sound work is technically adroit without calling too much attention to itself (which is pretty difficult under the circumstances). The design weaves the viewer in and out of Ruben's head and gives a sense of what the character is going through. Marder is also judicious in how he uses subtitles for the signing only once Ruben himself could understand them. Subtle, but spot on.SOUND OF METAL takes a bit of time to elevate itself from the standard structure it follows, and there are times where the story doesn't quite flow in quite the way the writers obviously intended, but these are fairly minor quibbles. Just the fact that the film doesn't treat deafness as a 'handicap' is worthy enough of attention, but the acting and technical skill on hand make it something much more. Like Ruben's character, the film grows.",

(I heard in an interview that Riz Ahmed had 7 months of drum lessons prior to filming. I've looked through Buddy Rich's 'Snare Drum Rudiments' and Ted Reed's 'Progressive Steps to Syncopation' but I must have missed the chapter on beating hell out of the cymbals for a whole gig.)Anyway, Rudy goes deaf for no apparent reason. He wears ear defenders and has no obvious signs of any illness, he doesn't go for tests and doesn't seek advice, though I'll suspend disbelief and give the writers some artistic licence.He books a test with an audiologist, who, rather than playing varying frequencies and amplitudes of sine waves at very precise levels, says a series of words and asks him to repeat them. From this he arrives at the conclusion that he's lost 72% of his hearing in one ear and 80% in the other. He tells the Rudy that the most important thing is to protect what's left of his hearing. Cut to the next gig where Rudy has taken his ear defenders out and is beating hell out of his kit again. He walks off stage in a huff, followed by his girlfriend guitarist who he lives with in an RV, but hasn't sussed that he's gone deaf.He books an appointment with another specialist who tells him about cochlear implants, which cost $40-80k, but it's ok, they'll just get it done and worry about the cost later.His girlfriend takes him to a hippy commune run by a deaf Vietnam veteran who will teach him how to be Deaf.There were lots of conversations using sign language, but not really ASL, more like sign supported English. (ASL has different syntax and word order.) Most of the conversations were head shots so the sign language largely became irrelevant anyway.He starts hanging out with the kids at the Deaf school, and this unknown, former heroin addict is entrusted with taking a young boy out of class when he becomes unruly. Soon he's rolling around on the floor with the entire class. I think I'd need to look at the school's safeguarding policy.He smokes a cigarette and his girlfriend leaves him because she's scared he'll go back to taking smack again.He sells all the band's equipment (without speaking to his partner) to get two cochlear implants. No pre-op counselling or advice. He's disappointed with the level and quality of hearing the CIs have given him.The Deaf commune kick him out after he asks for money to buy his RV back and they're offended that he wants to rejoin the hearing world.Somehow, after spending all his money he manages to get a flight to France where his GF has gone back to living with her millionaire socialite dad. He tries to convince her to go back to the USA and start the Yoko band again.She says no. He takes the implants off and is happy.The End.Woeful acting throughout and a script that feels as though they made it up as they went along.Nominated for six Academy Awards.",

We feel Rubin's torment, anguish, and anger as he gradually loses his ability to play the drums he loves and feels losing the girl he adores. We feel the uncertainty as he sees his world crumble. Rubin sells his prized Airstreamer RV and expensive music equipment to pay for the surgery that might save his world, but in this process feels the memories he had with Lou (Olivia Cooke) inside that RV slipping away from him. First his girl, then the memories he shared with her slip away for a risky surgery that may or may not return him back to his music and to Lou.The scene when Rubin shows up in Belgium where Lou's father lives. The dialog between Rubin and Lou's father. The sincerity of that scene about a father who loves his daughter and the man he once felt was taking her away from him as her mother once did. The dialog is minimalistic with few words, but yet so very powerful and tense. Two men speak and listen to each other frankly as they speak of the woman they both love. Lou's father expresses his appreciation to Rubin for all that he's done for her.But the real tear-jerker moment for me is when Rubin and Lou are both on the bed. Post-Surgery Rubin talks to Lou about his excitement to return with her on the album tour. The following conversation takes place. It shows how deeply Rubin loves Lou that he is willing to unselfishly let her go because he does not want to be the cause of further hurt in her life. That is true love. He loved her so that he was willing with great anguish to let her go and let her find her own happiness.Rubin: \"Yeah, the f_*kin' tour, everything.\"\nLou: \"Yeah.\"\nRubin: \"Like, we just gotta get back on it, you know, everything.\"\nLou: \"Mm-hmm.\"\nRubin: \"The album, the tour the, the You know?\"\nLou: \"Yeah.\"Rubin notices Lou's anxiety increasing and she begins to scratch the inside of her left arms where she had previous scars from scratching herself.Rubin: \"Hey. It's okay, Lou.\"\nLou: \"What?\"\nRubin: \"It's okay.\"\nLou: \"What's okay?\"\nRubin: \"You saved my life.\"\nRubin: \"You made it; you made it beautiful\"\nRubin: \"So it's okay.\"\nLou: \"What?\"\nLou: \"Why are you saying this?\"\nLou: \"You saved my life, too, Rubi\"The next morning Rubin carefully leaves so as not to wake up Lou. Rubin does not want Lou to hurt any longer because of him and the album tour. He releases her and wonders along the canal listening to the sounds of the street.

As a result it feels like a very personal and close film.Sound of Metal is at its best in its middle third. It is here that the films emotional core lies, as Ruben integrates with the deaf community and begins to adapt to his deafness. The film is at its most beautiful here, despite the struggles that Ruben continues to face and the pain he experiences. I think it also helps that the cast is at its fullest in this third, with great supporting performances from Paul Raci and Lauren Ridloff.Saying that, one of the things that I really liked about the Sound of Metal was how small the cast was. It was a very minimalist film that was never crowded. This allowed us to really connect to Ruben and feel what he was going through on a personal level. I loved this connection and it was carried through the entirety of the film. He was a complex character, with a past stricken by addiction that we are privy to but that is not fully explored. This required a highly accomplished performance from Riz Ahmed, which we got. He allowed us to instantly connect to him and feel the fear and uncertainty that he felt.Olivia Cooke as his on screen part was great too and the two of them had fantastic chemistry.My only real criticism of the film and the reason I'm not giving it a 9 is that I think it had a slightly weak end. It felt a little rushed and, despite the very end being a satisfying conclusion, the 20-30 minutes leading up to that felt a tad empty.Overall Sound of Metal boasts an impressive script and story, great style and direction and some fantastic performances.

He is a recovering heroin addict and the band lifestyle keeps him away from that.As the hearing loss advances Lou persuades Ruben to begin to accept his disability by joining a church funded hearing camp/facility ran by a Vietnam War veteran, Joe (Paul Raci).Ahmed actually learned American Sign Language for the role and Ruben becomes quite proficient in it as he begins to accept his disability amongst a fellow deaf community.Or does he accept it? Deep down he still has a yearning to return to his previous lifestyle and somehow raises the money for the cochlea implants.It is at this point I realised the impact of the sound design on the film as the viewer not only hears Ruben's hearing deteriorating in the first act but how some semblance of hearing is restored by the implants. The impact of crowds and singing on the sound Ruben now hears is also prominent.How would you cope in Ruben's situation? Would you learn to accept your disability and do something about it like Joe's deaf community or forever yearn for past and insurmountable feelings?A great film that perhaps is one of the best of the year.

I connected immediately with the film's lead, brilliantly portrayed by Riz Ahmed who should be nominated for a best actor in a leading role. Not to give to much away here, but the third act one that might go down as one of the best endings I've seen in a film period. What I enjoyed most about 'Sound of Metal' was it's unpredictability. I credit this to writer/director Darius Marder and co-writer Derek Cianfrance ('The Place Beyond the Pines', 'Blue Valentine', 'I Know This Much is True').",

            "content": "My Review - \"Sound of Metal \" streaming on Prime\nMy Rating 9/10Today it was announced today that this film \"Sound of Metal \" has been nominated for 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actor for Riz Ahmed , and Best Supporting Actor for Paul Raci and also Best Screenplay.\nThe film is also a BAFTA hopeful with 3 nominations including another Best Actor nomination for Riz Ahmed.\nWell after seeing Sound of Metal I have to say of all the Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor movie performances this year these two Actors stand out for me.\nI have a feeling though that it will be a sympathetic posthumous win for Chadwick Boseman . With the greatest respect for the departed and much loved Actor Chadwick Boseman's performance in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom doesn't even come near to the superb performance of Riz Ahmed cast. Riz is cast as Rubin a punk heavy-metal drummer's life that is thrown into freefall when he begins to lose his hearing due to excessive volumes in the music the band performs.\nRiz Ahmed a 39 year old Actor also known by his stage name Riz MC and birth name Rizwan Ahmed, is a British Pakistani actor, rapper, and activist.\nRiz is truly brilliant in the challenging role of Rubin a successful heavy metal drummer who is faced with the consequences of entirely losing his hearing due to the excessive loud volumes of sound that his eardrums have endured.\nDirector and writer Darius Marder shows how loud in the opening scene of \"The Sound of Metal \" where Rubin and Lou his girlfriend ( Olivia Cooke) perform \"Purify\" I had to turn the volume down but heavy metal music lovers might turn it up. Thankfully that's the only really loud song and it's so effective when we realise Rubin is going deaf .The Director cleverly fades out and cuts out chunks of sound as would occur with rapid deafness and we can imagine the panic and fear that this young man is experiencing.\nThe research that went into Riz Ahmed's role and this film are impressive an a large number if the cast were hired from the deaf community. For eight months, Riz Ahmed prepared for the film by spending two hours a day learning American Sign Language, two hours a day in drum lessons, two hours a day with a personal trainer and the remainder with his acting coach. Director Darius Marder wanted Ahmed to \"trust his instincts\" and did not allow him to review dailies of his performance or script analysis. The film was shot in four weeks\nSound of Metal is an educational, inspiring film on many counts as experiencing the trauma of deafness Rubin is also a recovering addict of 4 years and is convinced by his supportive girlfriend Lou played beautifully by Olivia Cooke to seek support in the fear he may pick up again.\nRubin reluctantly joins a recovery programme ,especially designed for the deaf run by Joe played by Paul Raci,who is also nominated for Best Supporting Actor.\nJoe try's to get Rubin to accept his deafness and with the help of sign language teaching and the connection with others Rubin has to decide whether to stay on as a valued member of the recovery community or move on.\nThis film is an amazing achievement and deserves all the accolades it's receiving and I hope Riz Ahmed and Paul Raci achieve great success at the upcoming Oscars and BAFTA Awards.\nDon't miss this one.",

            "review_title": "Rooted in Humanity",
            "content": "SOUND OF METAL has a pretty simple \"one-line summary\": Heavy Metal Drummer deals with going deaf. But is it the humanity at the center of this film that makes it worthwhile.Written and Directed by Darius Marder (THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES), SOUND OF METAL tells the tale of Ruben, the drummer of the Heavy Metal Band BLACK GAMMON, who must come to terms with suddenly losing most of his hearing.Starring Riz Ahmed - in an Oscar nominated turn - SOUND OF METAL follows Ruben's journey as he comes to terms with the wrinkle that his life has thrown at him and the silence makes him study the non-stillness inside of him.This all sounds like it could be corny, right? Well...under the guidance of Marder and with a central performance that is grounded and real by Ahmed, it is anything but. This film finds itself in it's humanity and the very real, personal interactions.Credit must start with the performance of Ahmed (heretofore known to me as Bodhi Rook in STAR WARS: ROGUE ONE), he is in almost every scene in the film and he must bring a vulnerability to the screen for the audience to care about him - and he accomplishes this in spades. Even when his character makes mistakes (and, trust me, he makes a TON of them), you end up rooting for him to succeed.Paul Raci was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Joe, the head of the Deaf Community for Addicts that Ruben eventually goes to. His turn is also grounded in the reality - the reality of addicts who have yet another twist in their life thrown at them. Raci has a road-weary look to him and gives off an aura of someone who has seen - and heard - it all, so must take a \"tough love\" approach. This performance works very well.Also strong in this film is Olivia Cooke (READY PLAYER ONE) as Lou, Ruben's girlfriend/lead singer of the Metal Band they are in. She must make some tough decisions in the course of this film - and you end up emotionally engaged in her story as well. Both Ruben and Lou are good people at heart that must make hard choices, you root for both of them to succeed even though, through these choices, pain and suffering and separation must occur.All of this sounds good, but there has been many a film that falters under the \"good intentions\" of it's Director/Screenwriter, but SOUND OF METAL avoids most of the pitfalls of these types of films by not dwelling too much on the pain and suffering of the leads - it's there, but (as Joe would say), deal with it. I'm a little surprised that Marder did not get a Best Director Oscar nod (the work is that good), but am glad that he did get an Original Screenplay nomination.And...as you can imagine...a film about Deafness is reliant on the Sound Design to help bring that aspect of Ruben's experience to the audience - and this film delivers the goods. The sound team was, rightfully, nominated for the Oscar for sound design - and they should easily win - for the sound is another character in this film and that is what, ultimately, makes this film works. The audience is put in Ruben's shoes and, at times, are unable to hear what others on the screen are saying.A very satisfying film experience - one that needs to be seen with no distractions (especially sound distractions), so find a quiet time, lower the shades and dive into the world of the SOUND OF METAL.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",

            "content": "Yes, winter movie season is in full swing. It seems like there are so many great offerings every weekend on multiple platforms. A plethora of opportunities for entertainment. Upon the suggestion from Prime Video, I watched Sound of Metal, which premiered on the platform on December 4, 2020. Here's why it was such a worthwhile experience.The plot of Sound of Metal is pretty simple - it's a drama starring Riz Amhed as a heavy metal drummer whose life takes an unexpected turn when he begins to lose his hearing. Ahmed plays the drummer, Ruben, who is part of the heavy mental duo with his girlfriend played by Olivia Cooke, and their music career seems to be going along smoothly. But, as a recovering addict, the hearing loss sends Ruben into a tailspin. As directed by Darius Marder, the crux of the film is how Ruben copes with the monumental change in his life and the emotions that he goes through, will he be able to hear again, will his relationship survive, will he survive and so many deep and devastating questions. It's not just a typical movie about an addict - though that is an important part. The film also dives into questions of identity and what makes us who we are - or who we think we are.All of these questions hinge on the strength of the performances of Ahmed, Cooke and Paul Raci. Raci plays a sponsor, or mentor of sorts, to Ruben as he deals with his addiction and his hearing loss. Ahmed plays Ruben so well. There's so much passion, and fear, felt throughout film. The success of the film really rests on Ahmed's shoulders and he carries it well. Cooke is very good as the girlfriend and bandmate. It's understandable why she may be a motivating factor for Ruben. Raci is very impactful in his part too. He's stern, thoughtful and makes a necessary contrast to Ruben. There's a lot of care in each of these performances and they grow as the movie goes along. These characters are really well-rounded and provide a strong foundation for this emotional story.If you are looking for a good, emotional movie to watch, Sound of Metal is a worthy contender. Riz Ahmed's performance is one people will be talking about for the rest of the year. Grab a big box of popcorn and don't miss this movie.",

Anyways, casting aside those details that are clearly important in real life, I still think this film stands strong.Many of us struggle to change our lives over time, but when someone has a significant change thrust upon them, in an accelerated fashion, to me that is fascinating. Never mind the striking contrast of drummer in a noise duo losing his hearing as the change covered. As for details, minor compared to the actual surgery and related aspects....the t-shirt work in this film certainly caught my eye.Anyways, more than a bit of a spoiler, but the \"break up\" between Ruben and Joe was more staggering to me than the break up between Ruben and Lu. A lot of the characters in this film come with back stories that are expressed in a couple of sentences, but pack the density of a black hole. Joe delivers his lines early on, but Paul Raci's portrayal fills in the spaces with a powerful soulful performance. Indeed spoken silence often when he's on screen, is as powerful as the message of silence he wishes to impart to Ruben. The old adage about the notes one does not play seems to apply.Reading up a little now on Raci, seems he was clearly the man for this role. As intense as Riz Ahmed was, Raci matched that fire with subtlety.The ability to adapt as human beings, and kids especially (those school scenes were the most precious of metals!), always impresses me.",

I remember she was travelling on a bus and the movie simulated the view through her eyes as her vision dimmed and then went black. (I've googled this without joy, so can't place the movie!) I found the concept of suddenly losing one of your key senses to be utterly terrifying. So, I was fully engaged with Ruben's issues in this movie.I thought the movie was going to be downbeat and depressing. But, both with it's positive portrayal of the deaf community and with the extraordinary ending, I found it to be a wonderfully heart-warming tale.Positives:\nThere is just SOOO much depth to this story: a character torn from his familiar world and struggling to adapt to the changes. It's fundamentally a movie about acceptance of self. The last two minutes of the screen time are momentous: one of the best endings of a movie I can remember in recent memory. A truly religious experience.\"Sound of Metal\" won the BAFTA at the weekend for Sound, and deservedly so. It's another leading character in the film, with the editing deftly weaving between the soundscape that most of us live in and Ruben's perception. Apparently, the sound team used a hyper-sensitive microphone in Ahmed's mouth to pick up the inner noises of his body.Both Riz Ahmed and Paul Raci are nominated for Oscars. Simply stunning performances from both of them.Although not nominated, I'd lob Olivia Cooke's name into that frame too. It's almost IMPOSSIBLE to see the same actress who played \"Pixie\" in the body of Lou. It's a transformation akin to Charlize Theron's in \"Monster\". (In fact, it took me until the Paris scenes to actually recognize her!)Director Darius Marder - IN HIS DIRECTORIAL FEATURE DEBUT! - delivers a fabulous example of \"show not tell\". All of the detail is present in the film to tell the story if you look for it. You don't need dialogue to give Lou's backstory: just a casual shot of her lower arm is enough.Negatives:\nIt's a VERY minor quibble but, with a 2 hour running length, the Paris scenes dragged just a little for me. I might have chosen to do a few nips and tucks there in the 'party' scenes. But I wouldn't have wanted to lose much.\"Sound of Metal\" has - I'm sure - a guaranteed slot in my Films of the Year list. Simply stunning and highly recommended, this is currently showing in the UK on Amazon Prime.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks\")",

Not to mention the factual errors about implantation surgery. Whole film feels like from someone just saw three pages of Wikipedia about deaf experiences and did a field trip to a deaf community. Audiences really can feel that the writers and director try very hard to twist the plot to fit the main message of this film, stillness.

Sound of Metal opens with him, playing Ruben, pounding the skins, bare-chested in a club whilst his girlfriend Lou (Olivia Cooke) screams into the mic. Music is clearly everything as they drive their world in an Airstream around the states. It's lofi DIY, music as a lifestyle, for love. Then Ruben's ears ring. You know the sound, even if hearing loss doesn't effect you. You know that high pitch warning sign that signals trouble. It's trouble for anyone of course, but for a musician, a young musician. Devastation is not too strong a word. We are put right in Ruben's head, all muffled and muted. It's pretty bloody terrifying. You have to strain as he does to make things out (although I cheated a little with subtitles). The world inside Ruben is markedly different from outside. When we hear the other perspective it's truly shocking and upsetting as to just how much he's missing. His loss is severe, possibly brought on by noise exposure, possibly something else. What's clear though is he's not much hearing left, has to protect what is left and has to make a choice. Choices are complicated things aren't they. We make our own, often don't understand others and this is often hard to comprehend. There's also denial, a strong complicated emotion and Ahmed pulls off Ruben's masterfully. Although it's Ruben's present that concerns us, he has a past too. One that could quickly come back to haunt him given his new bleak reality. Luckily for him, it seems he's some good people around him, one of whom introduces Joe (Paul Raci). Joe wants to help, can help, but it involves Ruben ditching that denial, before he implodes. Upsetting as the situation is. It is wonderfully uplifting to see people, a community, rally round and help, out of pure kindness, understanding. Ruben's isolation is palpable. Finding himself in a deaf community, learning to cope, there's little communicative sound and we're as isolated as Ruben. As he learns and his world opens up, as does ours and my god it is glorious! It's only one facet of his new life though. Sure he can communicate again, has even found meaning in the work he's doing within the deaf community. Music though. Performing. Living. That, well he still needs it and try as he might, can't let go. He's forced to make another choice and somehow this seems even harsher than anything he's faced before. It's a heartbreaking to witness Ruben's reality repeatedly smashed, but amazingly insightful and ultimately startling redemptive.",

And why no one tells him what to expect from surgery? Probably giving those details would have caused to lose focus on deaf people community yet I think character development needed more.One final complaint is that ending was too dark for my taste. Of course I wasn't expecting a happy ending but in final moments the only option left for Ruben was to commit suicide considering his personality. At least he had 20% hearing before the surgery and now what he has is absolute silence or low bitrate sadness. He lost Lou, the community and everything. Is the message \"don't go after your dreams!\" Or \"don't try to fix problems even if there is a chance to fix it\"?I'm not sure about the message.

I still felt and became fully engaged in this persons journey.

The movie is very powerful and the sonic POV is phenomenal. That was my first exposure to something to this level of creativity. I loved the casting and would even go out of my way to say how much I even enjoyed the music the band plays. (Not hard to impress me though because I'm a metal head-even the abstract, atmospheric kind)My biggest issue with the film, despite its impeccable approach to sound, is some of the filming. The cinematography is great but it comes across as a blatant rip off Aronofsky's films. It's being done into the ground these days-cough, cough, Nomadland, the unfortunate Oscar winner. \"Quick cuts\" isn't a new element to cinema but the way it is portrayed in the film has been done by Darren Aronofsky, to the \"T\". The Wrestler particularly comes to mind when comparing films side-by-side.Overall, this film is a solid one that will outlast the test of time. It's worth seeing and re-visiting.Ps: if you have the chance, watch this film with surround sound or with quality headphones. You won't regret it.",

            "content": "''Sound of Metal'' is, in the end, a movie about feelings and, most importantly, about acceptance. I have recently read ''Blindness'' by Jose Saramago and while I admit losing your sight and having almost no one to help you is indeed the worst nightmare one can live through, rapidly losing your hearing is still one of the most terrible processes one could go through, especially if you're a drummer and music is your dream and your future. One is full of anger in front of destiny; he has never been so far from the ''amor fati'' ideal enunciated by Friedrich Nietzsche. The truth is I don't know how losing something/someone very important to your life and mental sanity feels like (except my grandpa, but he died when I was 9 and my parents didn't let me go to the funeral so I only remember the happy times). Nevertheless, I can empathize with the main character and therefore comprehend the idea of having to accept a harsh reality and thus find the ''stillness'' one really needs. Oh, and great portrayal of the deaf community, I wish some characters could have had a more important role but it's O. K., they had their fair share. An 8,30 out of 10 from me.",

            "content": "While the craftsmanship of sound design is nothing short of excellent, it's nothing more than practical. It's by no means exceptional, but that doesn't take away anything from its value and efficiency that, in part, rendered this movie a truly immersive experience. It's Riz Ahmed's bravura performance, though, that gives Sound of Metal resonance that, in turn, made Ruben one of the most relatable movie characters I've witnessed in recent memory.His ability to reflect his fluctuating feelings throughout the movie and how he perceives every phase in his new life is simply astonishing. The aching experience Ruben goes through demands a real acting talent to make the audience emotionally connected to the protagonist, but Ahmed proved he's not just a talented actor but also one who's in a total command of his craft. For if it's hard to make the viewer feel what his character feels, it's even harder to transport its mental state to the audience. Here, we don't only get the sense of loss and being stripped of everything that forms every inch of Ruben in a flicker, nor only do we only understand his pressing need to regain what he lost-especially since the possibility hovering in the air-but we see him grappling with the dilemma of whether he should continue his journey of adapting to his new condition as if it was the norm or he should keep clutching onto the flicker of hope that definitely wouldn't help in case of it turned out to be a mere mirage.Furthermore, the movie also excels in aspects other than its nuanced portrait of its main character, namely is its exploration of deaf community that truly offers new insights. That's mostly because of the effort shown in the meticulous attention to its essential components, most notably the sign language. However, Paul Raci played a major part in that by portraying the leader of this community and a mentor for Ruben. Through his facial expressions during conversations with Ruben, he delineates the professional duties such an occupation demands. We see him monitoring Ruben's progress and interfering according to his understanding of Ruben's character in particular. As for Olivia Cooke, she further proves she's a remarkable young talent that yet to bloom. Playing Ruben's bandmate and girlfriend Lou, she managed to prove how important she's to Ruben as his most great and precious loss and equally as a great help for him to get a better sense of what he has lost and how to cope with that.The acting clinic these three immense talents put on here left an indelible impression on me, but disregarding the technical quality would make absolutely no sense. Besides the exquisite sound design, the highly-articulate cinematography truly adds up to the experience. If there's only one issue I have about this movie it would be its failure to maintain the same dramatic heft that was in its first half. As the focus on Ruben's progression through his medical recovery and its consequences slightly overpowered the emotional quality, and hence there was a bit of it lost that even the wrap-up failed to fully retrieve.(8.5/10)",

Great. Cinematography. Meh. Directing. Meh. Writing. Terrible. I don't know who wrote this, but whoever did must not understand the importance of pacing, because the next 5-10 minutes of the film (after the loud opening sequence) are just plain horrible.We get a couple additional scenes that could have easily been cut from the film, including an awkwardly extended dancing scene between the two main characters, in which they dance to some slow music (I don't know...R&B, whatever it is) and then that's when I checked out.

Could easily have been changed with no difference in the film.In reality the doctor he sees would have done tone tests (who hasn't run into those at some point?) but the film goes on and on with word recognition testing. The doctor does not describe what is going on physically with his hearing and immediately talks about implants. There are various reasons for hearing loss, but for a metal drummer one version is most likely. From other surgeries I've had I bet anything that there are brochures from the implant companies describing everything that the doctor would have handed him, or some kind of other information sheets.Even though he has been clean for four years he suddenly goes to a deaf addict live-in program for no reason. Then he is in a grade school classroom for no obvious reason. But all of these do seem like very possible realities, just not him being there. The head guy has him seclude himself in a room and write, not draw. Nothing comes of it.As others have written, the process of getting cochlear implants is nothing like what happened. A lot of education, doing one at a time, sessions to learn to hear with them, and just time etc. And insurance would pay for all the surgery and probably most or all of the implant itself. If he didn't have insurance already (insurance was mentioned like he had it, but it not paying was plain wrong) he would have been told to get on Medicaid, which he no doubt would have qualified for.A film can shorten and leave a lot out, but there is no reason to just get it all wrong.After his surgery the doctor writes a message about what is next. He would already have been told all that and more already. It would also be in that brochure.When he returns to the program the head guy explains why he can't stay. This would have been something he already knew. He wouldn't have come back.The sound design is excellent on portraying how he would hear before and after the implant. What is left out is the therapy and just time and experience that would teach his brain to correctly interpret the post-implant information. The acting and overall reality of the scenes is all on point, things a less indie Hollywood film might get wrong. How did the director not realize all the things very wrong with the script? Oh, he was one of the writers.So, maybe worth seeing for what it gets right, but you have to ignore a whole lot it gets wrong.",

The movie ends with the answer to the meaning that stands when we see the movie viewing experience. Riz Ahmed lived the role, I am sure he must have spent weeks both learning the drums and sign language. It's a good movie watching experience altogether.\nWhat did not work:\nAs a movie related to metal, I was expecting to see a bit more sequence on performances or drum solos. It's not that they did not make us believe it, I wanted more personally. Also, a bit more insight by the lead character leading to the finale would made it better. At times, the permeability of the sound of deaf and normal hearing can be a disturbing experience. I would have been delighted with a bit heartwarming ending rather than the harsh, real ending. Maybe because it answered pivotal questions but not all.\nFinal verdict: having said that, it's a very recommended movie",

The acting, writing and sound converge to make a beautiful symphony on the screen, which is ironic given the fact that a lack of sound is central to the story. Seeing Ahmed's Ruben struggle with his declining health is difficult, but it also opens up other aspects of his life. It's also worth noting the performance given by Olivia Cooke as Ruben's rocker girlfriend, Lou, as this is perhaps the most mature role Cooke has had to date.The most touching moment in 'Sound of Metal' is the final scene.

Sound of Metal is a simple story, but the technical elements are well done and you feel like you're going on this journey with Ruben. I loved the avoidance of tropes and not trying to tie up every plot point with a neat bow or have generic rises and falls, but instead to have things happen and people move on as happens in real life. Ruben's struggle to accept his hearing loss at the start is well done, and I thought it'd go down an Aronofsky-style route of Ruben refusing to give up and remaining obsessed with drumming because it's all he knows, and it eventually ruins his life. It's not that type of obsession-driven movie; instead, it's a much more intimate story of a man adjusting to life as a deaf person and transitioning from being a drummer to a member of a deaf community. Ahmed is really fantastic, one of my favorite performances of the year. His initial confidence that he can do it and reluctance to admit the problem is great, but what really sold me was his reaction to the surgery. Finally he can hear but it's not very clear, and you can tell he assumed it would be a silver bullet and that everything had to go back to normal and in that moment he is crushed realizing it wouldn't. It also may be the best sound design I've ever seen, doing a great job of showing his perspective and how daunting the loss of hearing is while not losing any exposition or meaning in the scenes. This is a very solid film that really thinks about the nuances of losing your hearing, but is also an excellent and authentic character study.",

There's an amazing sense of subtle anger and dread to both of them, and they're easily the best two things of this.Aside from the interesting aspects of the deaf community though, I couldn't help but feel like the story was slightly cliche \"tortured musician\" stuff, but he's a good tortured musician so why am I even complaining.",

And the deaf community he was at literally shunning him for wanting to regain his hearing seemed weird, too.

We can say that this film has a superb performance from this lesser known actor which should get him accolades. A difficult character to play and Riz has done well. Some films should be seen for the sterling performance of the lead actor. This is one such film. Go for it.Director Darius Marder has made a memorable movie on this subject and has extracted a superlative performance from Riz. After his hearing loss, Ruben's relationship with his steady girlfriend becomes turbulent and they separate temporarily. Ruben then joins an American sign language group run by a Vietnam War veteran (Paul Raci ) who attempts to rehabilitate him in the world of silence. Ruben however is keen to get his hearing back and sells his belongings including musical instruments and van to get money for a cochlear transplant.This interesting film has many scenes which will move you. There may be aberrations in the technicalities of audio tests or post surgery procedures or sign language classes but that does not take away the honest intent of the director in portraying the sadness associated with loss of hearing. We find that Ruben starts liking the peace which he gets from silence but is it temporary? He has the option now.",

The story then meanders along without focus. More \"flesh\" could have been added to the other characters there. Or more focus on RIz's character to do something positive. Or negative. DId he really achieve the entire amount in cash to perform the surgery? How did he go back and forth? Including scheduling appointments? After getting the diagnosis and being told about the surgery - they drove some distance to the camp...\nCurious about the ending , but don't wish to give it away in the every the director wanted that to be the \"big decision\"...

Then, we experience the journey of the main character's life altering misfortune through his, denial, decisions, regrets, self-hatred and acceptance with the help of some great acting by Riz Ahmed.It also has an exceptional cinematography that helps build that bleak, grey and depressing world that his world has become. But for me where the movie shines the most is the sound design (as the name suggests). The excellent use of dynamics turned this movie into a sonic roller-coaster ride. The amazingly loud and almost obnoxious opening scene which eventually makes way to their dead quiet rv is great introduction of what's to come. As we progress through the different stages of his deafness, the sound design is always is accompanying us with meticulously crafted silent moments as well as disgustingly distorted unpleasant ones.We follow Ruben, a heavy metal drummer who is slowly losing his hearing.",

            "content": "\"Sound of Metal\" (USA, 2019) is a drama, directed by Darius Marder (Place Beyond the Pines) and written with the also director Derek Cianfrance (Blue Valentine, Light Between Oceans) that is the author of the story.The story follows Ruben, the drummer of a Death Metal band, that plays and lives in a van with his girlfriend and vocal Lou on small gigs, and is starting a career.. Suddenly he starts to lose his auditions, and the movie shows the struggle in his life to adapt to the situation and search for help, with the possibility of recovery with a cochlear implant surgery, but not having the money to do the surgery. All the stressful situation leads to a separation of the couple, with Lou continuing the gig and Rubin reluctantly agreeing to seek help in a deaf community to better learn to deal with the handicap.The plot is intense on emotions, and shows in a realistic way the drama of losing the sense that was essential to Rubin - all the story revolves around this character, and especially from the middle to the end of the movie, the personal drama intensifies, even with the contemplative silence that occupies most of the film, or the sounds of the implant that he acquires later. The scenes that show the adaptation in the community(that uses deaf actors) is absolutely great.The movie has Riz Ahmed as Ruben Stone (Rogue One, Nightcrwaler, The OA,The Night Of), Olivia Cooke as Lou Berger and Paul Raci as Joe (interesting that he had a deaf father in real life). Riz is just awesome on the paper, that involves showing the emotions, despair and anger to the silent parts of the individual learning, dealing and acceptance of the situation. Indeed something that deserves the prizes and indications for best male performer. The def community used deaf actors and that elevated the veracity of the story.The cinematography by Dani\u00ebl Bouquet (Nothing persona, Kaubow) is pretty competente, taking a more realistic like approach, with a nervous camera, focusing very well on expressions and situations that are really important in the context. Another great detail is the sound department, with the sound of deafening sense and later with the implant sounds transmitting well the sense and situation of the protagonist that leads to such emotions that he feels.Overall a great drama, with an intriguing and engaging story, without the load of melodrama that depicts in a realistic way the situation and the study of the protagonist, with the help of an excellent performance and use of sound department on the production. A solid 7,5 out of 10.",

Even, when we thougth he accepted the situation, he was still looking for his way back which is understandable given the circumstances. First, the denial of the loss of his hearing. Then, the anger. Later on, trying to learn to be like a deaf person while still handling the depression of it all along. Which ends up with the acceptance one and for all. Plus, he is always in a struggle whether it is to learn the language, to collect money for operation or to put everything back on track.Everything about the film is great we both see what he is going through as an audience and Ruben himself at times. Especially, where he recklessly plays drums in his van, the one he listens to Ruby singing to honor her mother and lastly the ending are all powerful scenes. Yet, the most powerful is probably, when Paul Raci's character Joe asked him to leave after operation because of possible consequences and the responsibility of other people in here. It was a really emotional and a geniune scene. What a great feature-length debut for Darius Marder.",

I was very happy to find an incredibly detailed and true depiction of these realities (deaf people, hearing problems, cochlear implants, etc.). And particularly as a musician the story spoke to me in a really intimate way about a fear that I always had. The performances are fantastic and the film doesn't try to be more that it is (a development of a very particular and potentially real situation instead of a universal truth about life or some other cheesy thing), which I think was a vey good choice. It may not be a great film for everyone, some people may find it boring, too slow or not relatable, and I understand them if they have never been close to a similar situation, if they aren't musicians or if they don't have interest on the subject.

            "content": "The acting is amazing, Riz Ahmed simply destroys here, and Olivia Cooke is very very good too, in limited time she is on screen.But probably the main point I have to highlight about the movie is the sound mixing/design... like, this might be the first time I see a movie and go \"holy cow the sound design is amazing\". The way it helps the movie explore the struggle of hearing lost so well is unbelievable, you feel Ruben's pain, you understand what he's going through, and you want him to get better, but fist and foremost, you feel scare for him, thinking how hard that would be. Also, of course, you appreciate and respect the hell of the deaf community for fighting and prospering beautifully through all this difficulty.I love how the movie shows his evolution throughout, and also, the subtitles, where they only appear after Ruben learns sign language, so for half of the movie, those who don't understand sign language just have no idea what they are saying, like Ruben doesn't too. And the ending shows that evolution of the character perfectly, after trying to again, go back to something he already lost entirely, he just accepts life for what it is... and the result is a calm and beautiful world around him. So, the ending scene is greatAll that been said, I don't think the movie is perfect, I have a couple of problems with the story arc overall... like, the hearing implant, wouldn't anyone tell him beforehand the thing wasn't the same as the regular hearing? That's such a crucial point in the story, and the impact we as the audience feel, when we hear what he's hearing... but, in a real-life situation, how likely would it be, that the dude would spend 40k+ and... nobody would tell him that it wouldn't sound like his \"regular hearing\" sounded? I mean, c'mon.I also didn't understand what exactly did Lou's video made him think... cause it's once again, a big turning point in the story arc, he's fine, he's happy for the first time in a while, and then he sees the video... and wants to sell his stuff. At first, I thought Lou was like homeless or something, doing gigs in the street to pay the bills or something... but she's clearly not, and he knew that. So... what's the deal with the video? Did he just missed playing with her? Idk.Still, the movie is pretty, it's really immersive, and it gets you through this difficult and long journey alongside Ruben, which is amazing to see and experience.",

The rise of Riz Ahmed is amazing in this Amazon original.It's clear now how the streaming platforms are taking over with their quality content, it started a lot with series, but as more streaming services are coming to existence we are now seeing fantastic movies created on this streaming services. Nothing can take away from you the cinema experience and I believe that never should never happen, but I also believe that the movie industry needs to adapt since there's space for both.Sound of Metal tells the story of a metal drummer that slowly starts to lose his hearing capabilities until he goes completely deaf, sounds interesting enough just by the concept, but the movie strives on how it approached the topic. First of all Riz has a fantastic performance, his posture, behavior and overall personality is so distant from what we see on interviews, you can spot from a distance the acting quality of this guy, adding to that, he prepared months before the actual filming in order to learn sign language and to be exposed to an unknown world for a lot of us, and it shows, the credibility of his performance is really good.It's an issue we all heard about but the majority of us doesn't deal with it at all on our life's, but getting a grasp of how horrific can be for someone to slowly become deaf, it wakes you to appreciate more your everyday life and the fact that you can experience the sounds of the world. The movie captures this beautifully, while presenting moments of deep silence followed by sounds of nature that we tend to ignore.\nAdding to this, we also learn how someone with such an issue can accept the reality, not in all cases it can be reversed, and although I defend that if we can find a cure for it we should pursue it, the movie shows to us that it's about accepting and that actually you can even become empowered even if at first it seems that the world will crumble. Silence can be beautiful and in a chaotic world it can elevate us to a more peaceful state of mind.\nOverall it is a touching story, a theme that goes outside of your everyday movie, and a fantastic lead performance.",

This film is a portrayal of how his life changes thereafter. Performances are superior all around. Olivia Cooke is sympathetic and compelling as his love interest and fellow musician. Ahmed is riveting in a starring performance that shows his true depth as an actor. If he was not widely known before this film, he will be now.The film veers back and forth between the protagonist's point of the view and that of someone with normal hearing. This binary narrative is alternately effective but also occasionally jarring. Although there isn't the smoothest narrative at work here, it does have a strong sense of realism in how radical a change deafness is for anyone and those closest, let alone someone in the music profession. It also conveys the raw heartbreak that comes with losing one's hearing as an adult and coping with the extreme changes that follow.It's a fairly difficult film to watch if you've ever known someone dealing with hearing loss. In that regard, the early part might be especially tough to get through, which shows the devastation of deafness becoming a reality. But a film this amazingly acted on such a delicate subject does not come around very often and thus is highly recommended.",

            "content": "\"The Sound of Metal,\" (2019). Starring Riz Ahmed and Olivia Cooke, and Paul Raci. Directed by Darius Marder. This is a structure film. The structure is linear, a downward spiral from the main character's successful rock career as a drummer to the abbysmal loneliness of disability...hearing loss. Ruben's journey is ma8rked by denial, fear, anger, betrayal, isolation, conflict, and finality and everything inbetween. Through each phase, we see Ruben strive to do everything in his power to regain and hold onto a life he's devoted to and loves. He learns to shift dependence on sound to dependence on sight. Eye imagery becomes dominant, and Ruben's expressions and visual focus enable us to take each step with Ruben as he has to undergo his illfated journey. He loses everything. His career, his girl, his home, his friends, his hearing. At the end of the film, he is standing alone in a strange place with no prospects. No hope. What will become of him? Will he be relegated to sitting alone in an environment stripped of anything recognizable, writing on a new blank page every day? Like the guide who trained him to adjust to his new handicap? This movie teaches us to have charity for those with handicaps and to be thankful for our blessings. Because but for the Grace of God, there go we. This movie is depressing but well done. I give it 5 of 5 stars. It's on Netflix.",

And while the direction of the story hereon is somewhat predictable, this doesn't hinder its impact and originality nor its ability to communicate a universally humble story of acceptance.",

            "content": "\"It's not abnormal, living as deaf is normal\", this is the point deciphered from the haranguing of Joe while he is in confronting Ruben. Ruben becomes deaf all of a sudden and doesn't want to be in that stage because of the music that he carries and also for the enamored to his girlfriend. So he just toned deaf peoples are handicapped and it as an illness but Joe clears this point that we stated in the first sentence. Sound of Metal is not only just about the problem of losing hearing capability it is far beyond the concept of sound and silence. For a musician, sound is important. Ruben cannot accept his decreasing variation of hearing ability so he wants to get it back through cochlear implantation. His only motive is to get back his hearing ability. But for this recovery, he is supposed to spend some days in a Deaf Community and indulges there. He goes through various lives of mute and deaf, experienced, and probably gets the position to learn their sign language. He just builds up a good relationship with the people there but his thriving to get back his hearing ability compulsive him to sell his kit and van. After the implantation, he goes to her girlfriend but there he realizes this artificial ability doesn't work on his way. He just leaves and throws away that device. This is the fragment about Darius Marder's Sound of Metal. In a simple way, the subject is so small but in actuality, the director finds a way to put something fresh here. It travels through the inner struggle of Ruben (the protagonist), his thrive and dedication to get back his hearing ability. The film also provides new learning to the audience also, about sign language. The most important thing about the movie is its sound design, that is for the film got its Academy Award. Both the director's point of view and the character's point of view leads the designers to design the sound. When it shows the profile close-up of Ruben, we hear in the way like Ruben. This kind of making projects a new technical perception and a good experience for the audience. And at the end, before the end credits showing up there is a silence longing for about 2 or 3 minutes was an absolute strategy of making and I appreciate that. Special mention for, Riz Ahmed and Paul Raci.",

Usually i'll be checking how much time I have left by the hour / hour and a half mark but I didn't check it once. I was totally in for the ride that was Rubens coping / rehabilitation as he learns to deal with his deafness and everything that comes along with it.

You can hear the reactions by non-metal fans: \"Serves him right for making such noise!\" But this film is much more than that. More than any film, with the possible exception of Children of a Lesser God, this one creates an incredible about of empathy and understanding towards those with hearing impediments. Ruben (Riz Ahmed) and his lead singer/girlfriend (Olivia Cooke - a long way from \"Bates Motel\") live in an RV that serves not only as their home, but their studio. They travel and perform and sign records, and this is their life, until Ruben starts losing his hearing. That begins an odyssey for the initially unsympathetic Ruben, which begins when a home for recovering drug addicts with hearing loss welcomes him. The movie could have spent more time explaining his girlfriend's history (she was a recovering heroin addict when she met Ruben and after he leaves her, it is hinted that she returned to using). But then again, this is Ruben's story, and it is ultimately believable and very touching. Ahmed may score an Oscar nomination and deserves it - it is a juicy role and he dives head first into it, much as JK Simmons did for Whiplash.",

The acting is excellent and really elevates the characters development to the next level. I don't think that the whole metal genre or drumming has any real reason to be in the movie. I think this could have worked just as well with a different music genre and/or instrument. The middle section, while still good, is just really slow and can get a bit boring. It's very sad to watch how the character reacts to the situation and is probably the most real part of the movie, but it all happens too slow. The ending, I thought was going to be a let down just because of how the movie was going, but I was surprised... I really really loved the ending, it was perfect. Very satisfying although it still makes me think on all that has happened, is in reality the ending really isn't that good of a turn out. Anyway a very strong drama, 8/10.",

I went into this film expecting a musical drama in the vein of \"Whiplash\" but there is very little music. Rather, it is a psychological drama that follows Reuben, our protagonist, as he comes to terms with his terrifying new reality.Riz Ahmed has been hit and miss for me since \"Nightcrawler\" but his performance in \"Sound of Metal\" is the best I've seen all year. As a musician, I could feel the turmoil he was experiencing as he pounded his drums to nothing but muffled tones. Not only is this a musicians's worst nightmare but as an addict, he lacks the mental capacity to cope with the situation and Ahmed conveys this to perfection. Olivia Cooke and Paul Raci were also fantastic in their supporting roles.The sound design in \"Sound of Metal\" plays a crucial role putting you inside Reuben's perspective and the technical team knocked it out of the park. It is haunting listening to his hearing deteriorate throughout the film. Often, the sound switches between a clear audio perspective to Reuben's and the juxtaposition is quite shocking. Their work enhances the emotional attachment to the character and absolutely deservers Oscar recognition.The only issue I have with the film is some of the pacing drags and often there are jumps in time that are not clearly identifiable. A better balance in plotting the story elements could have led to a more cohesive viewing experience but this is still one of the best films of the year. \"Sound of Metal\" is available on demand and it is a cautionary tale that is worth seeing for all of my live performing friends.Grade: A",

            "review_title": "Want to love it but....",
            "content": "Acting is great, story is decent. A real life drama about a drummer, Ruben, suddenly losing his hearing (happens but it's super rare and usually this just happens gradually, but I give the movie the benefit of the doubt) and needing to get grip about life without hearing. It's all shot pretty well, video editing is excellent. Riz is THE best actor for this with his wide eyes.However, for the most part of the movie it wants to believe that you MUST then join a deaf community to come to terms with your new disability. And I use this term lightly because the deaf community likes to think they are not disabled and just a minority - which is where the movie goes entirely wrong. Should you really cut yourself off from your previous life just to adapt to your new issue? I don't believe that to be true. Why not just do some online research \"what to do when suddenly deaf\" to find that there are help sites. Learn to use sign on your own, get someone to help - but just ditching your life, your phone, your job (how does he make money if not touring anymore?) seems ridiculous. Especially as it's obvious Ruben doesn't want it and that ever wise owl Joe who took him in should have seen that, and then later he gets super upset about him not being one of those \"cult\" members he is looking for to keep around.So even if that IS how it has to be, how long, and forever? Why? No real reason is given that one must inclusively stay in the community and be totally shut off the world - like a Native American preservation that doesn't want the world around it to exist. Once you learn sign and have accepting your hearing is gone you would think you can join the \"evil\" rest of the society that he doesn't seem to be allowed to communicate with. The entire \"sit in a room and write\" part seems totally useful apart from some kind of rage inducer that he could have done in his RV as well. Why not just read a book or something... Also home videos have these great SDH subtitles these days.Second problem is the total dismissal of the implants. For one they ARE covered by medical insurance so that's already total BS the movie throws at you. That means no need to sell off your life's belongings to afford it, plus his girlfriend could have easily asked for the money from her dad which isn't really addresses - but I suppose he's not a fan of him and wouldn't just fork over that kind of money. Anyhow, seeing that it would be free this point is moot.Continuing from that, the implants are seen as totally horrible, distorting sound and not being able to have a proper conversation if there are too many sounds going around the room. That's not true. And think about this: you are blind and given an implant but the implant give you only grey-scale view of the world - are you going to complain and just prefer to be blind? The movie makes it think that silence is better than than hearing \"annoying noises\". With that they also claim that Nate is totally surprised by how the implants work out - as if NOBODY would have told him about this but in actually there are extensive tests before the operation, numerous consultations to explain what the result will be like - nobody goes into a clinic and says \"I'd like a metal arm because it won't break that quickly\" and the staff will be like \"sure thing\" without explaining the downsides of it.Lastly I find the girlfriend super irritating. If she didn't enjoy her previous life with Ruben she should just tell him rather than always following his lead. I know it's a theme of the movie but that goes against any kind of female empowerment - speaking your own mind and just scratching your arms instead. It makes her look weak and pathetic. Also those eyebrows at the start look fiendish.",

            "content": "In his directorial debut, Darius Marder addresses a subject to which Hollywood hardly pays any attention and which is also not given enough awareness in society. Sound of Metal tells the story of the young drummer Ruben, who is on tour with his girlfriend and pursuing his dream of becoming a musician. Of all things, this passion becomes Ruben's undoing when he suddenly loses most of his hearing. As a result, his life is no longer the same and he embarks on an adventure for which he is not really ready.Ruben is embodied by Riz Ahmed. He is the clear protagonist of the film and appears in every scene. His journey from a dreaming drummer who has the seemingly perfect life with his great love to a deaf depressive who wants to return to that life is fascinating to follow. Ahmed plays this complex character with great subtlety. But he can also boil up from 0 to 100 in some moments and give free rein to his feelings. His multi-faceted performance makes it easy to understand his situation and to sympathise with him. Ahmed totally captivates you and represents people who have suffered the same fate with a lot of dignity. Olivia Cooke, as Ruben's girlfriend Lou, only has a few scenes at the beginning and at the end. Still, it's enough time for Cooke to introduce us to her equally complicated character in a way that we can understand her as a relative. Another terrific performance is delivered by Paul Raci as Joe, Rubens' also deaf mentor. He runs an association for the deaf and acts as a sort of father to the members. He acts very calmly and emotionally, especially in the heart-warming dialogues with Ruben, though there is always a certain toughness and honesty in there. His chemistry with Ahmed is the highlight of the film. As a veteran who has long since come to terms with his situation, he sees himself in the newcomer and wants to show him that deafness is not a curse.Sound of Metal sends an enormously important message and is hopefully a wake-up call towards Hollywood. Over the 120-minute running time, it's clear that this film was a matter of heart for Marder and the ensemble. As a result, much of it lingers for days afterwards. This fact makes the film-experience all the more beautiful and real. Real is the word that best describes Sound of Metal. Every scene seems realistic and probably takes place in real life in exactly the same way. The slow, almost still pacing in the middle of the film can seem boring, but is very important for the film's authenticity. Sound of Metal is a film you have to see to get a slight insight into the life of this fundamental group of people.",

Ruben must struggle with his inner demons while trying to find meaning in his new inaudible world.Riz Ahmed, from Nightcrawler and Venom fame, is heart and soul of this film. He gives one of the best performances of the year as the toiling drummer. You can see the pain behind his eyes as he watches his dreams pass him by. The anger, the frustration, the hurt, never too far away as he deftly navigates emotionally complex scenes. Ahmed should be an instant lock for an academy award nomination for best actor.Director Darius Marder does a fantastic job keeping the film centered around Ruben's world. The camera never straying too far from him and keeping his face in focus even when he is not the fulcrum of the scene.Sound plays a huge part in fully understanding Ruben's journey and the sound mixing and design in this film is outstanding. Switching between muted audio and over exaggerated sounds, the mixing takes you in and out of what Ruben hears. Besides diegetic music at the beginning of the film, there is score and it helps immerse the audience even more in the deaf community.The third act struggles to be as important as the first two and film slows down a bit. It feels almost out of left field with a new location, new characters and new story direction. It is, however, just a minor blip on a fantastic film and one of the year's best.",

But then sometimes you see a couple that seems so happy and connected and right for each other that you're just happy for them and wouldn't dare try to come between them. Watching this film felt like seeing that couple. It reminds you of your own lonliness and past failures, but it also reminds you of how much beauty and love is in the world.I'm not an overly sentimental guy, but this movie just put me in that headspace. Cianfrance is one of my favorite working filmmakers, but the fact that this is a first feature for directer/co-writer Darius Marder is incredible- I'm so excited to see what he does in the future. And of course Riz Ahmed is astounding, he really just nails this one so hard it's incredible to watch. Olivia Cook was great as well, truly believable in her dual personalities. And it was a nice treat seeing Mathieu Amalric pop up unexpectedly.As a musician who spent a lot of time playing in bands, as well as a recovering addict/alcoholic, maybe this film was just tailored for me personally, but I haven't been hit this hard by a film in a long time.",

In fact, speaking of the protagonist, he is one of the best things in the film, without a doubt it is the best work of Riz Ahmed's career and can even earn him an Oscar nomination, all the characters are very well developed, with the character of Olivia Cooke , who plays the girlfriend of the main character, the actress is very well in the role, but she is not as well worked as the others, in the third act they even try to give her a greater depth, but nothing much. The film's photography is good, it has very beautiful plans and the director knows what he's doing. The feature also braces with some comic reliefs that work well, help to lighten the film a little. After all, it is very pleasant to follow the character's trajectory, you really care and support him a lot.I think the third act is a little less than the first two, it is good, of course, but not as good as the others, but the film gets it right at the perfect moment, the final message is very good.",

That being said, it wasn't enough for me to get past the 65 minute mark.I was gripped as soon as Ruben's hearing went out, and I was intrigued to see how his life would transform because of this. However, the movie just turns into a series of events in which Ruben is incredibly angry and frustrated with what's going on, and it becomes incredibly dull. No opponents, no desires being pursued (apart from him wanting to buy hearing aids, which is more of an abstract idea and something he didn't really have a plan for, from what I saw). Maybe I missed some stuff. I fell asleep three different times, then decided to turn it off with 40 minutes left to go.The cinematography is fine. The sound design is great. The acting is great. However, the movie really lacks an interesting story and interesting revelations. Maybe it picks up in the last 40 minutes, I don't know.

You will be devastated and embittered by how life has treated you unfairly. This is exactly how Ruben (Riz Ahmed) feels when he starts losing his ability to hear. Sound of Metal is a 2019 American drama directed and co-written by Darius Marder which tells us about a heavy-metal drummer named Ruben who is one half of the metal duo Blackgammon along with the singer, his girlfriend, Lou (Olivia Cooke). His life starts going into diasarray when he starts losing his hearing ability. To overcome his hearing problems, Riz seeks help from a place for deaf recovering addicts. This movie is thought provoking and displays a plethora of emotions. It gives us a sweet message of embracing our imperfections and living a lovely life along with them. Riz Ahmed delivers his career's best performance and should definitely get an oscar nomination for this spectacular performance. Paul Raci also deserves a great credit in supporting Riz Ahmed with his role as the person who runs the rural community from which Ruben seeks help from. Go watch this movie to see one of the best lead performances of last year along with a moving and heart aching story.",

It wasn't a mysterious ailment, but most likely years of daily heavy metal abuse, even if the doctor tactfully allows for a possibility of the former. And Ruben (Riz Ahmed) ain't no Beethoven by any stretch of imagination. The movie lets us hear what Ruben hears and it is most effective in those moments. There are rich elements added, such as the fact that the place Ruben finds himself at is a sort of halfway house for deaf addicts, which he also is. There's a big question about people choosing to live deaf. And at its core the movie is a sweet love story.I think it would have been better if the filmmakers allowed us to stay in Ruben's head and thus in silence instead of rather arbitrarily switching back to sound. The addiction part is glossed over. I would imagine a catastrophic, life altering event could spell double the catastrophe for an addict. The big question is never really addressed. And there was something about that love that just didn't feel strong enough. Both Ahmed and Olivia Cooke who plays his girlfriend are excellent actors, but something is missing. I don't usually judge chemistry or lack thereof, as it is such an hazy concept, but I can't think of any other explanation.In spite of shortcomings the movie ultimately works - on the strength of the story and Riz Ahmed's quietly anguished performance and magnetic screen presence.",

Olivia Cooke, so captivating on stage and in the RV, is reduced playing a plot device, as Lou's character development is not a priority. This is a missed opportunity, as Ahmed and Cooke are so good together in the early scenes.Recommended despite the limitations of plot and character development, Sound of Metal has so much going for it that it is a shame more care wasn't taken with Lou.

Ruben thinks his career and life are over when a doctor says his condition will worsen. To keep him off drugs and adapting to his new life, her boyfriend Lou contacts a former addict about deaf rehabilitation. After being accepted there, Ruben is forced to choose between two lives. The progression of the story is steady and feels profoundly sensible, which kept me completely secured on the characters and pondering where the plot was going straightaway. With Riz Ahmed's character at the focal point of the film, he flaunts some top-level acting while at the same time depicting the crude feelings that Ruben is going through, causing the crowd to feel all of outrage, dissatisfaction, and different feelings on this rough street on the way to endorsement of his hearing misfortune. The topic of acknowledgment is the place where the film truly dominated since it hammers home that being hard of hearing isn't an issue by any means, it is our musings about it, wherein lies the genuine issue. The main thrust of this incredible message surely must be Joe (played by Paul Raci), who is an instructor at the hard of hearing local area that Ruben joins. His quiet, gathered, and relieving persona furnishes the film with the ideal guide for both Ruben and anybody watching the film on the way to edification. Changing the way that Ruben considers his 'issue', was the lone answer for tracking down his inward tranquility, and relinquishing every one of the negative feelings he was managing. With these all inferences, My review is 9/10.",

Ruben, a young drummer (Riz Ahmed) plays heavy-metal in a band of two, with his girlfriend Lou. His life revolves around the love for music and the love for Lou. They have a somewhat peculiar, but genuine and sweet relationship, and even though their gypsy-like trailer life seems chaotic; he feels happy and at piece.\nThen something happens to Ruben. He doesn't just start to gradually lose his hearing; he goes almost completely deaf at a snap of a finger for an unclear reason. He bargains, he gets angry; but just like that his whole vision of life, the idea of where it's headed and how he manages it has to change radically. We focus on someone, whose entire existence revolves around a world of sound, lose that which defines his life; a change so sudden and radical, it seems impossible to adapt to. An entire Lost Generation in one man. Still hoping to immediately get himself an operation to put implants in, he goes to live with a \"deaf community\" for a while, trying to re-learn how to function in a society in these new circumstances. And this is where the magic begins.\nHe arrives at the house at around 20 min mark into the film, and for about 40 minutes there isn't a single word spoken. The film turns into a fully visual experience as we gradually get subtitles the more sign language Ruben begins to understand (don't forget to turn on the subtitles!). For the most of the time, we acoustically perceive the world as Ruben perceives it: distorted, muffled sounds; I've never heard it done like that in such detail in a movie before, hence the Oscar nom for Sound. With Ruben, we get to know a whole other universe that's always out there and that we are rarely ever aware of. It is incredibly interesting to see all the unusual ways humans can interact with each other. And I have to give credit to the incredible determinations of Riz Ahmed preparing for this role: he spent 6 months learning the drums and he learned American Sign Language specifically for this film. Initially, to immerse himself in the deaf culture, he wore auditory blockers deep inside his ear canal that emitted white noise so that he couldn't hear even the sound of his own voice; and after some time, he decided to forego the blockers and simply communicated with the director and deaf cast almost exclusively through sign language. All of that contributed to his spot-on, subtle performance, and he truly deserves an Oscar nomination as well. Already at that point of the film I was going to give it an 8/10; but it got even better.\nI would have to give up the ending to explain why, but I will say this: the movie turns into as close of a modern version of \"The Great Gatsby\" as it gets. It is a deeply, profoundly sad film that I keep thinking about more and more long after I finished it. It is much more than just \"a film about the deaf\".",

Also, the sounds of the film immerse ourselves into Ahmed's world, a unique touch that many films don't do. Films may portray sound to the audience so it is understandable, but films often don't portray sounds to the audience so that they can actually feel what it's like to be in a character's position.Also, a movie that you can watch with your family, however, if you are looking for something happy, wouldn't recommend this, because it is quite disheartening.

I really wish more people would watch this one because this film is deserved to be recognized. Riz has landed his best performance till date.",

The sound design is another major area in this film. It is done so wonderfully that it was well done in terms of depicting the situations of deafness.Well-worthy of your time... Recommending...",

            "review_title": "Riz is truly something special!",
            "content": "I've recently become familiar with the actor Riz from watching Encounters. He was so amazing that I decided to see what else he's done. So of course I had to check out the movie that landed him an Oscar nom.This movie didn't disappoint at all with regards to acting. Absolutely great performance by Riz and the entire case honestly. Riz so masterful in scenes where he doesn't even have lines. He emotes so well with his facial and eye movements. The actor who played Joe also deserves a mention. I thought he gave a lot in the little screen time he had, especially his last scene which had me on the verge of tears.I loved the plot of a person becoming hearing impaired and their journey with coping and life after. My mom is blind, but wasn't born that way. So I have some familiarity with living/loving someone with a disability.I thought the script was good even while minimal. And giving us just enough of a love story without being too soapy or cliche was sooo appreciated. It may have even elevated the movie leaving all that out.The sound engineering was spectacular because it gave the audience a glimpse into the distorted sounds and even complete silence that a deaf person would experience. Many times throughout the movie, this coupled with Riz's performance brought me into these moments of intense frustration and mental anguish that as Ruben battled while trying to communicate with people.My only critiques of the movie is regarding the character development, some plot holes and pacing.For a movie this long, there was a lot that felt rushed, especially in the second half of the movie. Perhaps too much time was spent on overused and mundane scenes in the beginning... the couple laying around or just eating. Conversely, the transition from acclimating with the deaf community to the ear surgery seemed so sudden and rushed. I had to rewind the movie because I felt like I had missed something.We also have no idea of timelines. So this too gives off a feeling of being rushed towards the second half of the movie. How long was he in the retreat? We have no idea how he amassed $80k for the surgery while at the retreat. Sure musical equipment is expensive, but he absolutely didn't have $80k worth in that RV. Additionally, he has the $80k for the surgery but not $3k to get his RV back? He can't afford to stay with Joe, but he has enough money to stay at a hotel for 3-4 weeks until his earring activated? Also, later in the movie we find out the girlfriend is basically a rich kid who intentionally likes living the poor struggle bus lifestyle. If she truly loved him, why didn't she ask her dad to help pay for his surgery until their career aspirations afford them enough to pay him back? There is just so much not tied up with this. And you can say that I'm nitpicking, but these issues for me hurt the cohesion and believability a the story.We are also robbed a little of Lou's transformation. Sure the movie isn't about her, but she's a critical person in Ruben's life. So maybe a scene or two to give us more on her journey. We see her as this high strung anxious disheveled person (who self harms) in the beginning, to this balanced well presented woman in the end. So was Ruben her issue, and getting away from him allowed her to heal? Was she on drugs and got clean? Her dad mentions that she's better, but never truly says how/why. I'm ok with leaving it up to the audience to figure out, but I would have liked this tied up a bit better.I also felt the movie rushed Ruben's realization that his past life with Lou and music was no more. Riz did amazing so it's not his fault. I'm thinking it's the writing and directing of those last several scenes that make it feel too sudden to be believable. This is a man who spent all that time (lol well it could have been a couple weeks or couple of years; we have no idea) at the retreat bonding with everyone, especially the children. He abruptly abandons them for the hope of regaining his hearing and reclaiming his previous career momentum with the love of his life. Then he suddenly abandons all of that after one night with Lou? Was it one night? We have no idea! I get the overall arc, but it could have been done so beautifully with the appropriate pacing.I did like that tender moment in the end where he removes his hearing device, but again it felt rushed. To give you an example of what I mean: At the end of Forest Gump after little Forest gets on the bus, we are left with this very sentimental, beautiful moment of clarity and peace with Forest just sitting there waiting for his son to return, as the feather from the opening scene floats away. The director allowed the scene to breath. The ending of Sound of Metal could've had this, and I think it tried to have something like it. Instead we got too much time of them laying around eating eggs and this critical scene was over so quickly.Overall it was a great movie in-spite of my issues with it. I will definitely watch it again.",

It was so perfunctory and I cant imagine a thoughtful guy like Ruben would not have been more aware of the pros and cons. (2) I also found it unrealistic that Lou was actually wealthy and she could have paid for the implants. (3) I was incredulous that the two of them did not communicate more during Ruben's stay at the house or that letters would not have been allowed.Enough of the negative though!I am glad this highlighted the deaf community and I thought the people who played the residents, teacher, student, and director there were great.In the end, this is relatable and moving on so many levels: the loss of identity and a way of life, the pain of feeling different, and the struggle to create a new life. Riz Ahmed's face conveys so much depth of emotion and vulnerability. These are universal themes told beautifully. One can also sense the thought and artistry that went into the sound/sight/story-line choices in the film.",

He gets rejected from his small support deaf community for pursuing surgery? Because he came up with the funds and it was a good option in his case? Stunned by all the accolades for this film - for one, it should have been a short film if they weren't going to bother to build nuance and complexity in the few main characters, and second, pursuing a medical treatment that may be right for you doesn't make someone 'ableist' which is what is implied.",

For example, it makes getting cochlear implants about on the same level as getting mini-dental implants. W/o real knowledge of this procedure, I'm guessing it is a lot more complicated and drawn out than this movie makes it seem. The cast is outstanding with just enough nuance without becoming maudlin. The sound editing verges on the spectacular. You may never again think of sound in the same way after seeing this movie.

The actors are superb - all of them award worthy. Riz Ahmed proves again what a beautiful actor he is - he becomes this character. The last few minutes of the film is a close up of his face. Wow!

            "content": "A worthy addition to the growing list of films about the deaf and deaf culture. Here, a heavy metal drummer named Ruben loses his hearing and embarks on what begins as a very sad and very lonely journey: to a deaf community out in the wilderness, to ear specialists...but mostly, to the innermost regions of his soul. Should he join the community (he's more than welcome), or (big leap of faith) try to resume his career and release that album he's been talking about? (He hopes to pick up his musical cues from the lead singer, who also happens to be his girlfriend; a tall order, to be sure.) Or should he agree to that cochlear implant he's been told to get? And if he does, how will he ever be able to afford it? (According to one doc, the surgery would cost $40,000-$80,000.) The film charts his successes (and failures) as he claws his way from one stage of his new reality to the next. As Ruben, Riz Ahmed is frustrated in some scenes, triumphant in others, often as raw as a freshly-opened wound, and always wholly present; his large, expressive eyes speak volumes. Olivia Cooke as his girlfriend Lou, and Paul Raci as Joe, his warm but no-nonsense mentor, are also terrific. Chalk this one up as yet another of the subtle, heartbreaking, and never-less-than-watchable dramas earning praise this year. It's well-deserved.",

I had initially thought it would be just another motivational story with a protagonist who beats all odds and makes it big in the industry and gets the girl in the end. I knew the loaded gun of the implant surgery would be fired eventually but it was a bit unexpected to see how that fit into the story.The plot was deceiving as it had me initially convinced that Ruben would get the surgery done and would get his life back together and meet Lou. When the surgery was unsuccessful I was still convinced that it would all get well and Ruben would get his hearing back, and maybe he would have some romantic problems with Lou in the end. It wasn't until the last few minutes of the movie that I realised it was never about Ruben getting his hearing back but it was about him, an agitated and disgruntled person finding peace in the cacophony of life.The movie sends a very powerful message and I loved the connotations and symbolisms. The plot developed so subtly that when the sound of silence engulfs Ruben's world and he looks up to the sun with the two lines of clouds making it seem like someone was watching him from above, it all came together so well. The ending was amazing as it showed nothing unrealistic. The story seemed believable and real and I love the way they tried to keep it that way consistently throughout the different phases of the movie with different sets of people.The acting was great, the portrayal of the lives of people in the movie was well executed. The way the realities of different people of different backgrounds was exposed makes one feel privileged about what they have, and respect toward the people that don't. The execution of showing that perspective was great if not flawless.",

Therefore, I understand some, but not all of Ruben's struggles. Most importantly, I understand the difference between hearing music with my ears and hearing music through hearing aids, and there is really no comparison. I always take my hearing aids out to enjoy music, and whenever I have no need to listen to people talk. They are necessary tools, but they are kind of awful.For a musician, or anyone for whom music is a central joy in life, hearing loss is an absolute tragedy. I have often thought how grateful I am that at least I can hear music, even if I miss some of the sounds involved, and the idea of never ever hearing music again is unthinkable. And this is what Sound of Metal explores - how hard it is to accept that loss and conceive of another way forward. I loved that in the beginning, it is made clear how much Ruben loves all music, dancing to delta blues and singing to classic soft rock in the space between his and Lou's passionate metal performances. Ruben and Lou's relationship was also quite beautiful to behold.The only drawback to the immersive experience of hearing loss is not acknowledging that he can still communicate through text messaging and chat. Also, Joe's reaction to Ruben's decision I thought required a bit more exploration of the reasons and consequences.The acting by all was superb, and the soundscape was excellent and effective.",

As time passes he decides to get the operation to get his hearing back, but the directing of Darius Marder is far greater than simple clich\u00e9 attributes of signing and communicating, it immerses you inside the mind and soul of Ruben, superbly played by Riz Ahmen. Similar to Being John Malevich, you really feel like you're inside Ruben's body as he evolves and experiences the reality of the hard of hearing community and way of life through his eyes but with beautifully shot cinematography as well as the audible experience of cutting in and out static and frequency adjustment of Ruben's hearing aide. The acting is sophisticated, complex, and superb in this extremely underrated story. A really great, beautiful movie.",

Ruben, a recovering addict, is 1/2 of a heavy metal band, along with his girlfriend Lou (Olivia Cooke), who suddenly loses his ability to hear. From an electrifying opening scene, the viewer is thrown into a world of deliberate silence, just as quickly as the protagonist Ruben is. The lack of sound brings the viewer into Ruben's head, and relays the isolation of his initial inability to communicate with anyone. As it seems Ruben's world is crumbling around him, his obvious reaction is to try and fix the problem so that he may continue his life as a \"gypsy\" rocker with the love of his life by his side. As it turns out, and how life has proven time and time again, there is no simple solution. There is no way to go back to how life once was and sometimes we find ourselves \"addicted\" to the idea it can. Ruben eventually comes to the understanding, that sometimes the moments of stillness, is what we need to carry on. Darius and Abraham Marder, and Riz Ahmed's performance (which I can't praise enough) combines for a true work of art with The Sound of Metal. 10/10. Must watch.",

            "content": "Ian and I are continuing our effort to watch every Best Picture nominee for the upcoming Academy Awards, and this week we watched Sound of Metal. This was a film that had been on my radar - albeit as a lower priority - for a couple of months now. Riz Ahmed first caught my attention back in my freshman year at Purdue, when I watched Four Lions (2010) - an incredibly underrated black comedy film about a group of amateur terrorists in England. He also had a notable role in the excellent film Nightcrawler (2014), for which he received well-deserved attention alongside co-star Jake Gyllenhaal. I was excited to see what he would do next, but was nervous after seeing him get rolled into minor, forgettable roles in the franchise-driven blockbuster films Rogue One (2016) and Venom (2018). So, I'm that much more thankful to see him absolutely crush his starring role in Sound of Metal, for which he rightly has received a Best Actor nomination for. It was a film that surprised me, and I hope this review can encourage more people to give the film a watch.Sound of Metal is a drama film about a heavy metal drummer, Ruben (Riz Ahmed), who loses his hearing presumably due to the environment of dangerously loud noise that he consistently subjects himself to. After realizing his life is likely to be permanently altered, he begins to search for ways to regain his hearing and eventually seeks solace in a secluded deaf community, where he learns sign language and gains an appreciation for his new life. Riz Ahmed drives the heavy-handed story with an emotional, gripping performance as the troubled drummer. He compellingly portrays someone struggling to cope with the loss of his most prized sense, showing how the incident impacts his psyche, his relationships, and his perspective of his own life. At its center, the film is a character study on how something so fundamentally life altering can change a person, for better and for worse. It allows Ahmed to really show what he's made of as an actor, and it makes me eager once again to see what else he can share with the film industry.One aspect of Sound of Metal that's been getting much attention is its innovative sound mixing, sound design, and sound editing. Since the film is about someone losing their hearing, you'd expect it to go to some lengths to illustrate what the experience is like for viewers unfamiliar with the feeling. The film executes this brilliantly. When Ruben first realizes what's happening to him, we are taken inside his head, and the sounds of the world around him are replaced with something similar to what you'd hear when you plug your ears. You hear the blood rushing through his brain, the faint muffles caused by people trying to talk to him, and the audible vibrations generated by loud noises and forceful movements. The decision to do this, and the flawless implementation of it, creates a uniquely immersive viewing experience. Adding to this immersion is the filmmaking and editing decisions made to demonstrate the steps in Ruben's journey. For instance, during his early days as part of the deaf community and initial visits to a school for deaf children, American Sign Language (ASL) is seen and used prominently among the supporting characters. While subtitles are eventually employed to help viewers follow conversations, they are initially neglected to help convey the confusion and unfamiliarity that Ruben is experiencing in his new life. Small decisions like these make the film that much more engaging, enhancing the story being put to screen.Finally, Sound of Metal succeeds in its ability to portray a realm of life that most viewers know little about. The stylistic and editing choices made to support viewer immersion helps greatly in this respect, but the remainder of it is accomplished through the writing. In this respect I found the film very similar to Nomadland, which explored the lives of van dwellers and offered a poignant exploration of their lifestyles. The difference here is the characters portrayed in Sound of Metal are thrust into their lifestyle more out of necessity and less out of choice. We see throughout the film though that, despite the differences in everyday actions like communication, these are people who live life with the same fervor and passion as everyone else. We're all human, after all. I love the way it shows Ruben overcome and adapt to his difficult situation; it's motivating to see how he comes to accept his deafness as an empowering quality that defines him rather than a disability that holds him back. It makes me happy to see a film that so notably depicts ASL and the deaf community receive so much attention, as it contributes to the increasing diversity and acceptance of the film industry. I suppose the film is in the same realm as A Quiet Place for that reason - perhaps we have that film's success to thank for the attention this film is receiving.Sound of Metal is a film I supremely enjoyed. Of the four Best Picture nominees I have watched so far in preparation for the upcoming Oscars ceremony, I'd say it ties with Nomadland for my favorite one. Among other things, the film features a phenomenal performance from Riz Ahmed, innovative and creative use of sound, and an inspiring story with an emotional core. I hope we keep seeing films like this in the coming years: films that enlighten general audiences to lifestyles they are unfamiliar with and films that promote increasing diversity and acceptance in Hollywood. I'm happy to have watched Sound of Metal, and I'm giving it 10 out of 10 stars. Definitely check this one out if you have an Amazon Prime subscription.",

It's all very skilfully crafted and constructed by the filmmakers and is dominated by a powerful and compelling performance from Riz Ahmed, who conveys the chaotic and disorienting inner turmoil of his character quite brilliantly. The ending wisely avoids presenting a neatly wrapped up, crowd pleasing transformational moment and opts for something much more ambiguous which only lends the preceding events even greater poignancy and leaves you pondering various aspects and events from the film for some time afterwards.

The director,Darius Marder,did a marvelous job. Him and the writers got the best performances out of Riz Ahmed,Olivia Cooke and Paul Raci. Watching this movie,one can clearly see that the characters were written a lot of mulling and consideration. The Movie overall accentuates the struggle of people losing their hearing ability(especially those whose life revolves around music) and the deaf community.Riz's expressions and communication through his eyes highlights his stupendous effort in executing his role. Olivia Cooke and Paul Raci too brought a powerful presence in the movie .The theme of the movie is beautiful and brings a tremendous energy. All the actors nailed their roles with finesse.A true masterpiece!",

Every scene is just a fine masterclass of his performance.The scene where there's dread in his mind when he realises he might be going deaf while in the shower. The fear in his eyes. The helplessness. The angst.The climax, the final 5minutes of the movie, the stillness is one of the better endings in a movie that I remember in recent past. The acceptance and peace with himself.

But if you get too caught up with what you had, and what you thought you would have, you will never find stillness in your own heart. The lesson is beautifully illustrated through this extreme event, but it is one every person watching can take away.

The sound was impressive as well, as is manages to convey the sort of muffled sound that a hearing impaired individual usually experiences: is not just volume down, it's blurred and indistinct.There were a couple things that disappointed me quite a lot, though:I totally disliked the portrayal of the Deaf community. It should all be about acceptance of a disability and trying to get the best out of life notwithstanding the hearing impairment. There should be neither glorification of deafness, nor hate towards who decides to live with it and communicate with sign language, nor hate towards who can and decides to get a hearing aid or a cochlear implant. Everyone should be accepted as it is and not rejected on the basis of a personal choice.I didn't like the movie ending conveying the message that no hearing could be better than bad hearing. Any level of hearing, even if muffled and distorted, is better than anything. You can still communicate with Deaf people, but you also open yourself the possibility of communicating with non sign language speakers, not to mention safety reasons. I myself like silence, and I understand that peaceful feeling of removing the hearing aids, which I often do while at home. But denying myself the possibilities that my hearing aids offer me, just to be accepted by the Deaf community, sounds insane.",

This movie makes me feel so much, mostly of: Heartache and Elation. I love Paul Ruci's character, and I sobbed when midway thru the movie, he was adamantly teaching Ruben on how to 'sit still'. Something that is not easy to master in real life these days, so I relate a lot to the main character's struggle on so many levels. I bet we all do. That need and urge to take control of everything in our lives. Not that there's anything wrong to that, rite? Who would, if it's not ourselves. At the end of the day, when all is said and done, the only thing we can do is to be ACCOUNTABLE for that decision. Whatever that is. So, whatever it is you choose to do in your life, be accountable for it... \"And I sincerely hope, that it brings you happiness\"",

            "content": "\"Sound of Metal\" is a profound musing on the effect of sound on the life of every individual, as well on the existentialism of hearing vs deafness in terms of the meaning of life. It does not take sides in the worlds of the deaf and the hearing, but when it comes to loss of hearing in the life of an adult, it may border on a trauma and require significant adjustments in how the affected person deals with life - whether it provides a debate on cochlear implants or not.On an artistic and technical level, the movie is almost faultless in terms of photography, direction and acting, the latter being sensitive to dealing with loss of hearing and how it affects one's relationships.Magical moments in the film is the depiction of sounds without hearing them but vibrations from the floor (this may explain a Oscar nomination for Best Sound).Which the overall message (didactic or not) in the film boils down to, is the moments of stillness (and with them, inner peace/contentment) which one should strive to achieve in one's world of either silence or of sounds.In short, 9/10 (maybe more subjective than objective) for the movie journey through deafness, and may this film garner at least one Oscar out of the 6 nominations.",

Kids should be taught about this in school. Before my hearing aids I would walk into a busy pub or restaurant and all sound would be obliterated. I couldn't make sense of any conversation unless the person in front of me was literally shouting into my ear. This movie delivers the message and addresses the disabling effect of hearing loss very well. I thought I knew all about it from my experience but how wrong was I.

Our health care might be top notch, but it comes with a top-notch price tag, paying sky-high premiums and co-pays, out of reach for many.And the person who said that the character is saddened that his girlfriend has lost her voice... Screaming in heavy metal is a way to RUIN your voice, I'm amazed anyone could talk at all who \"performs\" like that. I've been around actors my entire life and no one ever used this method of screaming as a technique to improve their vocal quality. Her singing was much better at the end of the film, albeit maybe not to his liking.I think he simply realized their worlds had changed. But he also didn't give it the opportunity to explore or give it a chance, and as a result, we didn't get to see him explore his OWN inner character which we never really got to see in the first place. The ending was his new beginning of who knows what it will be.I wish we had known more of his back story other than a few clues of being a former addict and divorced parents. I didn't sense any inner struggle from him as to his LIFE other than struggling to get back to his hearing as a vehicle back to his former music which as we could see was NOT any kind of life. I'm not sure if that's what he realized at the end, I hope so but I didn't have any hope for him adding life discovery onto his bucket list.He seemed like someone who never bothered to look much inside, as with many people, so he probably had no idea that's what he really needed. Wish the screen writer could have added that layer to give Ahmed someplace to explore that extra dimension. I'm sure he would have.But I'm very glad I saw this and am rooting for him and the others nominated on Oscar night.",

            "content": "To begin with, I see why this movie was highly awarded for sound and film editing. I really felt the quality throughout watching. AND the way the filmmakers decided to present the shock of losing your hearing to the audience was genius!But the moral for me was the main character running around after being diagnosed with severe hearing loss, not accepting his fate (which was bad but also good - he was a fighter), trying to keep living as if nothing had happened, instead of finding a new way to live, integrating his condition into his everyday. After he went to the deaf community, he received a task, which\nin my opinion, life is all about. How many people are able to just sit in an empty room doing nothing? Sit there with a clear head (not under the influence of substances), alone, with your thoughts only. Many people, even perfectly healthy, would get a breakdown. They would be terrified because they have to deal with thoughts that they have been busy escaping from their whole life. This would be a perfect practice for every person, to wake up early and sit alone with your thoughts, only with an option to write them down. It is like looking in a mirror. And after a while people maybe have nothing to write anymore and they just embrace the moment, be in the moment.Ruben experienced full living while being in the community. In my opinion he experienced the most meaningful moments of his life there without even realizing it. And then he told the community leader that he will leave because life is running by... and he needs to \"go out there\" and start living again. But his previous life was a farce, revolving around a co-dependent relationship and ideals that he believed would mean living. Why was that self-destructing life better? In the community he discovered the beauty of giving. He discovered the beauty of listening to other people. He discovered the beauty of listening to HIMself.The actor who played him said after the movie that learning ASL made him communicate deeper than ever before. Deeper than he ever could using words. I think his character, Ruben must have discovered that too during his community life. And in the end of the movie he finally acknowledged it. It was the most beautiful scene in my eyes.The part of the movie was when the leader of the community told Ruben that in the community they won't cure his loss of hearing but they will teach him how to live with it was also important in my eyes. People tend to search for a quick fix, not only when something bad happens to them, but generally too. If a relationship does not work, I will break it up, this is a quick fix. The problem has to be the other person, not me and my own patterns. So it is very easy to find a new person as a quick fix, who at first, might bring out the best of us , but in the end we make the same mistakes as before. So instead of quick fixes we should look inside, work with ourselves from day to day...relationships are all about work.Addictions need work, not quick fixes; losing your hearing, sight, being diagnosed with something, it all needs dealing with it daily, not quick fixes. BUT people love quick fixes. That is the reason why health promotion is not popular... it is not a quick fix, it is a change of patterns, change of lifestyle, change of thinking. People do not like that, that rips them out of their comfort zones. So they turn to medicine, which offers you quick fixes. Take this pill and it will numb your pain as if nothing was ever wrong.So this movie actually is more about that pattern that runs in our society, not simply about hearing loss.",

There were a lot of feel-good moments in the first half of the film. The thought of not using any background score in most parts of the film but instead having natural sounds play out like the breathing of the actors and chirruping of birds was mind-blowing.

Normally, I don't write reviews for films, but this one had a glaring hole that caused a donut sized hole in my heart that might never be filled with the sweet relief of a fried pastry. About halfway through this film, a donut was introduced. It would have been but a prop until Ruben decided smush it and then reconstruct it into a bread pudding. Any viewer versed in the ways of film or recognizes a thimble would have realized that the donut is somewhat of a Chekovian device. Reuvein expresses that he would like to eat a gun, then he doesn't eat a donut. Coincidence? I. Think. YES! It is. I demand a 8 part spin off on HBO that focuses on the donut! The movie is literally titled \"Sound of Metal\", so why does it not focus on the donuts??? Reuvein is not the kind of bloke to ignore a donut (who is????? The Queen????

An initial sense of overwhelming suffering that was transmuted into moments of true connection, play, joy and stillness. Paul Raci was phenomenal in his role as Joe - as the viewer I could sense the journey the character had undergone before becoming a leader amongst the deaf community. During the scenes filmed at the deaf community, we were given an insight into life without sound purely by virtue of these scenes unfolding - it is not often we are deprived of this constant sensory stimulation in our daily lives and I found it moving to navigate this change at the same time as Reuben. The 'kingdom of heaven' that Joe describes when Reuben is alone in the morning, left with only the glistening blue sky and the peace that passes all understanding. The deeper sense of connection Reuben forges with the community of deaf children, finding himself lost in periods of playfulness and joy beyond the image he has of himself.This unfolding allowed me to experience Reuben's journey of transformation also, which is why the movie connected with me spiritually in so many different ways. For those undergoing similar parallel journeys, I am sure we can all relate to that familiar false sense of self, constantly attempting to sabotage and pull us out of that place of deeper understanding. Through this, understanding that ultimately Reuben had to regress back to his former life to realise this deeper truth himself, beyond anything Joe could have ever told him. This was beautifully depicted in the final scene as Reuben consciously choose to return to that place - that place that will never abandon us.Beautiful and touching film.",

            "content": "Another film in competition for the Oscars 2021 with a great theme, but rather poorly realized, by an author completely unknown to me, Darius Marder.\n\nFirst of all, let's clear up a few untruths that are presented in the movie, namely, most medical insurances, even in the US, cover operations in cases of hearing loss. Then, the implant placement operation is always performed first on one side, never on both at the same time. And most importantly, couples in such situations are most often encouraged to go through together e.g. learning sign language, and not being forbidden to do so for some mysterious reason.\n\nOn the other hand, criticism of the plot, according to which it is illogical for the main actor Riz Ahmed to continue making noise immediately after receiving the diagnosis (a couple of months of rehearsal is not enough to call even the most talented actors drummers), really doesn't stand, because it is natural for each of us, and especially the character as presented in the film, to need time to accept and face the new facts in our lives. It is these moments that are, in my humble opinion, the greatest value of the story. Unfortunately, the film did not go any further than that, and that is also the biggest complaint, because it has obviously long ago become a trend to shoot stories without any messages and conclusions.\n\nThe biggest praise goes for the supporting female role of Olivia Cooke, who, in addition to inspiring acting, allegedly performed all the music scenes live on her own.\n\nIn any case, the film deserves a passing grade, unlike some other nominated works, which did not manage to come up with the topics they set out to do. Sometimes it is better no ending at all, than one indulging in the mere commercial taste of the audience, with an extremely illogical plot and maximally stereotypical male characters, using \"subverted expectations\", as in the so-called revenge-feminist \"Promising Young Woman\", which is also in competition. We will see who will do better at the awards ceremony in April.",

Most commonly, from \"City Lights\" (1931) to \"Bird Box\" (2018) or \"The Invisible Man\" (1933 and 2020, among other adaptations), it seems at least, that sense is sight, as motion pictures are primarily a visual medium, but they've hardly ever been entirely silent--not even silent films were silent, accompanied as they tended and tend to be by musical accompaniment and occasional sound effects or live narration. I've been tagging such use of \"sight-analogy\" on Letterboxd, it's such a frequent reflexive device. All the better, then, when art is featured in the picture. In the case of \"Sound of Metal,\" the art is heavy metal music (hence the title, which also takes on something of a double meaning when the protagonist later drums with his palms on a metal slide in a key scene that a deaf child feels, or listens, to). Similarly, this music is not entirely audial, as there is an unmistakable look to the rock scene. Shown stereotypical pictures of how one dresses--what sort of tattoos or blonde highlights, e.g.--one might do well at guessing what sort of music they prefer. Nevertheless, \"Sound of Metal\" is about a drummer who loses his hearing and at least partly because of playing music. The consequence of which is to focus one's senses on the distinctive qualities of the art, whether music or, by extension, cinema.\n\nIt helps that it's well acted, led by a standout performance from Riz Ahmed and a good supporting cast headed by Olivia Cooke, and well dramatized--even the drug addiction and scratching works--which makes for a nice conflation that the movie isn't just about what's important to art but also what's important in life--there being considerable crossover of both. If this doesn't get an acting Oscar nomination, it better at least get something for the sound. Few films feature such an acoustic focal point. \"The Conversation\" (1974) is an obvious exception, but not to compare this to what's probably the greatest exploration of sound design in film history, it should be indication enough of how good \"Sound of Metal\" is that the comparison even comes to mind. Featuring deaf characters, including some real-life deaf actors, draws attention to the picture's sound design, as well as to the image when the picture becomes silent as well. In general, I especially appreciate the shifts here between subjective and objective camera positions and the accompanying varying degrees of silence and sound and of seeing. The last silent scene is perfect. I don't think a better ending could've been made.",

Unsurprisingly, Riz Ahmed as our protag, Ruben Stone, is incredible and, again, #2 performance of the year only behind Delroy Lindo in Da 5 Bloods \u2014 Elisabeth Moss is also up there for her performance in The Invisible Man. What is surprising is that Darius Marder made his directorial debut with this thought-provoking, touching, and entertaining film. Stone is \u00bd of the punk-rock duo, Blackgammon, the other half being his girlfriend, Lou (Olivia Cooke). Ruben \u2014 with the punk adage \"Please Kill Me\" tattooed across his chest \u2014 is a drummer who suddenly loses 90\u201399% of his hearing. If this wasn't enough, Ruben is a recovering addict, 4 years without using, and therefore needs \u2014 to his chagrin \u2014 not only a deaf-living house but sober-living, too. Marder uses sound in a way I've never experienced before \u2014 maybe because it's never been done(?) \u2014 to portray Ruben's disability. There was a moment when I thought the entire movie might've been conducted in this manner, which would've made a powerful point, but definitely would've been difficult to complete, but instead switches between regular hearing and the hearing-impaired. The direction and acting also beautifully showcases the frustrations of not being able to communicate. If there's one shot to stick with you, it's when all of the deaf school-children are resting on the grand-piano, Ruben right there with them. This movie is still new, so I'll spare more details, but the last three scenes, upon reflection, is one of the best sequences I've had the pleasure of viewing for a long time. There weren't many must-watches from 2020, but this is absolutely one of them.",

It sure has that look at times, but it's a bit deeper and has a few tailor made touches I guess. Ruben is a drummer in a metal band. He is an ex heroinist and lives with his girl and band member in his RV. They do gigs, but are never a big band. When he suddenly loses his hearing things naturally change. His career is no longer something to chase and he does not have much else. He gets into some sort of home. Kids and grown ups. Some earlier addicts, all of them are hearing impaired. He hats it at first, but likes it after a while. He still want's his surgery to make him hear again, but that's very expensive. His girl is someplace else and for some reason cell phones are prohibited from the home he stays as so there is not much contact between the two. \n\nThings are constantly happening here, mostly into something better. It has great sound, it looks good and it has a very great pace. It's never flat - but rarely big or really hitting you hard. A good film that could have been even better, but again, it could easily have been way worse too.\n\n8 out of 10 drumkits.",

Sure, I would not begrudge Chadwick Boseman for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, but Riz Ahmed I think will be the underdog, and this deserves the plaudits. Riz Ahmed has been a wonderful presence in the filmic world for a while now, the first time I saw him he was terrific in Chris Morris' sobering Four Lions (2010) but this is him at the peak of his powers. Playing a drummer in a thrash metal sludge band, he begins to lose his hearing, in scenes that are truly terrifying, and brilliantly capture the initially horrifying prospect of losing ones hearing. Sublimely supported by small cast, most notably an excellent Olivia Cooke and Paul Raci, Ahmed's Ruben must overcome his inceptive doubts about joining a small deaf community (led by Raci's Joe) to come to terms with his hearing loss. Ahmed is sensational, making you feel every emotion using every bone in his body. This is not a performance that steals the film, or indeed makes the film. The Sound Of Metal is absolutely brilliant on its own terms as well, and the final scene, without giving anything away, is utterly perfect.",

It had a great cast, Ahmed shines in his role as Ruben Stone, and Raci as well in his role of Joe. Ahmed in particular, was what made this movie what it is. While I don't think that the film itself necessarily deserves a 98%, I'd give Ahmed 5 stars on his performance as a recovering deaf heroin addict. He is so utterly convincing; he seems so desperately obsessed with not only the drug, but with the things that helped him off the drug, such as his girlfriend and their band. His utter commitment to finding a way to get the life he once had back illustrates an issue many recovering addicts deal with. It shows how he has only switched from one pill to another, and I thought that the scene where Ruben turns off the hearing aid and embraces the silence was riveting. I thought the screenplay, cinematography, and sound were all very good. I was blown away by what they did with the sound, actually. They really deserved the Oscar for that. The only thing that sort of bugged me about the film was the pace. It was really slow and that didn't really bug me as much as it has in other films but sometimes it just gets really annoying. Some parts confused me a bit, but ultimately I thought that it was very good. I was really unsure about how to score this film, but I went with the 4 because I think the max would probably be 4.5 and the minimum would be 3.5. On a side note, I'd also commend the film for not allowing the Amazon/Netflix signature cringe to dig into it.",

The film's innovative sound design further lights Ruben's experience, corrupting, completely fading out, or immediately reappearing with a chilling wide shot cut at Marders' cue. It's a keenly crafted character piece with jaw-dropping moments from minute one, and while the second act pulls into a slower, calmer burn that may drag in retrospect, the film's gut punch ending shines with a bittersweet empathy ranking among the best of the year.",

The best part of this movie was the sound design; similar to how The Father uses recasting and non-chronological editing to put you in the shoes of the main character, this film's sound design attempts to mimic the experience of losing your hearing.

With incredible performances, scripting grounded in realism, sensitive direction, and gripping sound design, 'Sound of Metal' tells a story that as many as 400,000 Americans each year may experience - the process of sudden hearing loss. Riz Ahmed's central performance as Ruben, a drummer who in an instant loses his hearing, is imbued with a deep emotional complexity that is complemented by innovative sound design - Ruben's panic, rage, despair, fear, and isolation are palpable as you watch him negotiate, and and eventually begin to grow in, his new reality of muffled silence. There are some scenes that make you want to reach through the TV and hug and comfort this man as his world falls apart around him, and again as he puts it back together. Olivia Cooke and Paul Raci are well matched with Ahmed in their supporting roles, the former as Ruben's deeply committed yet troubled love interest, and the later as a leader of an organization that supports the deaf. This film gives voice to a community rarely seen in film, and gifts awareness and empathy to it's viewers. It is certainly one of the most affecting, intimate films of the year.",

It also seems rather silly that nobody explained the serious limitations of the implants before he had the surgery. I thought the ending was a bit bland as well since the film seemed to be setting things up for him to jump off a bridge or something.

            "content": "While hanging out with musician friends at shows I noticed that before playing, they all put in earplugs. I wondered why since I thought this would make it difficult for them to hear each other. This was very much not the case. If you've ever been to a loud concert, it is way, way louder on stage. So, the premise of Sound of Metal, about a working-class heavy metal drummer whose world is turned upside down by sudden and profound hearing loss, is frighteningly believable. Thankfully, my friends still have their hearing. \n\nThe path that Ruben, played by Riz Ahmed with one of the best performances of the year, finds himself on is abrupt and unexpected to put it mildly. Likewise, the film never quite goes where you expect, but you believe every moment and every emotion. I wasn't expecting Sound of Metal to receive 6 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, but I am very happy that it did because I cannot think of many movies from 2020 that I enjoyed more. \n\nFaced with the loss of his hearing, his livelihood, and potentially his relationship, Ruben also fears losing his four years of sobriety from heroin. In need of immediate and special help, his girlfriend and bandmate, Lou (Olivia Cooke), takes him to a sobriety house especially for the deaf. The house is run by Joe (Paul Raci), a deaf Vietnam veteran and recovering alcoholic who gives off the impression that his inner peace only came after a hard struggle. He takes Ruben under his wing but tells him that his program is about finding a solution to the problem in his mind, not his deafness. The scenes of Ruben at the deaf sober house and learning how to live without hearing are interesting and very engaging. Director Darius Marder's gentle approach to the characters and Ruben's journey gives us the feeling that we are getting a window into a real community with real people, not participating in a kind of cultural tourism.\n\nAs much as I admire the approach taken by Marder's direction and the screenplay he co-wrote with his brother Abraham, Sound of Metal works so well because of Riz Ahmed's performance. This is not a case of an actor showing off their talents by playing a character with a disability. Ahmed plays a full range of emotions but the real pathos comes from his facial expressions, especially his expressive eyes. Most important of all to the movie's success, he is not afraid to show big vulnerability on screen or show just how afraid and anxious someone in this situation would feel, especially if they were a musician.\n\nThough we see Ruben getting on well at the sober house and with the larger deaf community, he still wants to have cochlear implant surgery which he believes will allow him to return to his old life. This is at odds with Joe's belief that being deaf is not a handicap or something to be fixed and leads to one of the most compelling and affecting scenes of the movie; one that likely earned Ahmed and Raci their Oscar nominations. It is easily one of the best moments in any movie I saw over the last year. \n\nI will admit that I was hesitant to watch Sound of Metal at first, despite its positive reviews, because a movie about a young musician going deaf seems like a heavy or even depressing movie. However, Sound of Metal ends up being an uplifting film without delving into melodrama or smarmy sentiment. Every aspect of this movie is low-key, allowing every moment to feel genuine. This is not the kind of movie with twists but it does have unexpected narrative turns which are best left to be discovered along with Ruben. All of the unexpected places, both physical and emotional, the story takes us are what make it memorable. The empathy in the performances from Paul Raci, Olivia Cooke, Mathieu Amalric, and, most of all, Riz Ahmed are what make it so moving. Sound of Metal is something special: a film so seemingly simple but deeply affecting. It is a character study so well executed that it transcends its premise and puts us so in tune with the main character that its final moments become spiritual, or philosophical, depending on your inclination.",

His performance in this movie is so pure, and he is more than deserving of the Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Of the big four acting awards, I felt strongest about Daniel Kaluuya winning for Judas and The Black Messiah, but this movie changed my mind.\n\nWhile it's not technically a character, the sound editing and mixing feels like one. It adds depth and perception to the deaf/hearing-impaired experience. Every sound is so thoughtfully added as well as the inclusion and omission of subtitles. As a byproduct of focusing on the deaf/hearing-impaired experience, Sound of Metal must rely on visual and sonic cues over exposition. This \"show, don't tell\" approach helps make this movie as good as it is. \n\nCurrently, this ranks as one of the five best movies I've seen for 2020. My only gripe is that the pacing is a touch uneven, especially in the third act. Still, the final scene provides a poignant bow to the story.",

            "content": "This was my review in my ASL class.  First of all, this film as AMAZING!!  I absolutely LOVED it!  I had been planning to watch it but just hadn't gotten around to it.  I've been taking ASL through a local college, and this was on our list for extra credit.  I was on Prime back in February and decided to watch it.  I've been recommending it to everyone ever since!  I felt the film was very respectful of the deaf community, and it seems like everyone involved made a big effort to really work together to portray what it would be like to suddenly go deaf and how that and subsequent actions taken would affect not only your own beliefs in what your identity is but also how it would affect other people's lives and perception of you.  The film of course reinforced the fact that people in the Deaf community can do anything they decide to do.  One aspect I hadn't really given much thought to was treatment and halfway housing for deaf addicts.  We've talked about deaf people having access to skilled interpreters during things like doctor appointments in my classes, but addiction recovery wasn't something I had specifically thought about.  That creates another set of challenges, as addressing addictions usually involve a lot of anger, doubt and fear.  If you don't have someone you can easily talk to with sign language to help you through that, it would really create a barrier to recovery and moving forward in life as a recovering addict.  I've had family members and friends who have been addicts, primarily alcoholics, and trying to overcome it was hard enough without an additional barrier of not having a common language to express yourself and get the help you need.  \n\nI loved seeing the progression of Ruben's perception of himself and acceptance of being deaf changing.  I thought he portrayed the denial, fear and anger associated with the loss of hearing quite well.  I thought that was probably how I would react in many ways.  I was surprised he didn't seem to make any effort to discuss getting the cochlear implants with anyone at the halfway house...it was heartbreaking to watch him learn he couldn't stay there anymore and to see Joe's face after he got up to leave.  I was sad he and Lou had grown apart, but in a way I think it helped him finally and fully accept he is now a deaf person.   That last scene was pretty profound.  I think Ruben will perhaps find a way to help deaf children experience music and maybe form a deaf drumming group, perhaps one that incorporates addicts...giving back and helping others find a new creative outlet for themselves.  I hope he remains friends with Joe, Jenn and Shaheem.\n\nI read the interview with Riz, and I watched the panel discussion as well as another video related to The Sound of Metal.  It had Riz doing an actor on actor interview with Steven Yeun where they discuss the roles they played in this movie for Riz and in Minari for Steven (another excellent movie!)...discussing perceptions, roles, and stereotyping in society and in movies...the freedom/exhilaration of using a language besides English as a primary language for their respective movies...the labels that are put on us by society...code switching to fit in with the society around you but to be you at home/with friends & family.  It was illuminating and powerful...I have a lot of respect for both actors. \n\nI found the panel discussion to be very uplifting.  I loved hearing from everyone on the purpose behind the movie, how CJ and others reacted to the movie, how the actors felt about their roles, the preparation Riz and Olivia put into learning the instruments and for Riz learning ASL by immersion and wearing suppression devices to mimic losing his hearing.  Paul Raci was particularly impressive in his efforts to call out Hollywood for not casting more deaf actors and actresses in roles.  I also was happy to see different interpreters working with the panel.  I really hope this film is a stepping point for Chelsea & Shaheem to find more roles.  \n\nThe film was fantastic in and of itself, but then watching the additional videos and reading the interview just took everything to a whole new level and really elevated this movie even more.  I've shared the link to the movie, the videos and the interview on my FB page and by email/text with a lot of close friends.",

            "content": "The sharp, precise and smartly constructed manner in which Darius Marder's debut feature begins is rather remarkable. Not only does it tell us everything we need to know about Riz Ahmed's recovering addict/drummer Ruben and his girlfriend/vocalist, Olivia Cooke's Lou, but it plugs us right into Ruben's nightmarish experience as he becomes aware that his hearing has been reduced to a disorientating static buzz. Much has been talked about the film's inventive designs in sound mixing which manage the rare feat of actually propelling the narrative forward, and every word, and every award it's getting for them, is true and well-deserved. In an equally awards-worthy performance, Ahmed is expressive, vulnerable and raw, and you just can't help but fall hard for Ruben as he struggles to learn how to be deaf at a deaf community run by (now Oscar-nominated) Paul Raci's Joe. It's to the writers' credit that, despite the presence of addiction in the storyline, that it never goes for easy shots or the usual melodramatic tropes that you half expect to see along with a special appearance by Marlee Matlin (who's of course wonderful in her own right). In fact, the film's slow and singular drive towards an inner reconciliation for Ruben is both unexpected and so nicely orchestrated, I find myself emotionally drawn and drained watching this insightful and authentic drama tackling not just a rare subject-matter, but do so in this particular way; and it's 2hrs long but hardly feels it. The last shot may look like your run-of-the-mill elliptically abrupt indie-drama ending, but it's less about what happens next and more about how he finds peace within himself; and as far as the film's emotional arc is concerned, it finishes with Ruben arriving at exactly the right place he needs to be in his head.",

            "content": "\"Sound of Metal\" captures the essence of many forms of loss, and on so many levels that the end result is far more rich and complex than one might expect, even by the film's mid-point. Ruben (Riz Ahmed, Best Actor nominee, whom you might know from HBO's great limited series \"The Night Of . . . \"), a heavy metal drummer, discovers he's losing his hearing within the first minutes of the film during a concert performance with his girlfriend and fellow band member of their duo \"Blackgammon.\" And with that loss, sound itself becomes another character in the film as Ruben fights to save what he can of his rapidly crumbling life. With music suddenly no longer a viable career path, one would expect melodramatic, over the top wallowing in pathos, especially given that Ruben is also a recovering addict. And while there are the expected and understandable outbursts of angry frustation and agony, they are few and far between as Ruben tries to piece together who he is now, and who he can become without lapsing back into addiction. Throughout his journey, the film's sound track mirrors the type and level of Ruben's hearing loss, placing us IN his experience. Muted, muffled, empty, painful, and many points inbetween, \"Sound of Metal\" takes the use of sound in cinema further than we have previously known. Sure, we have had the soundtrack reflect the muffled ringing in a character's ears following an explosion before, but no one that I'm aware of has tried to replicate the experience of going deaf like this, making it a probable shoe-in for the Achievement in Sound Academy Award. This is NOT a film designed to elicit sympathy for the deaf through cheap tear-jerker shots, but uses the deafness to explore loss, as Ruben's life and world crumble around him leaving him empty and desperate to find a future for himself. The majority of the film takes place in a retreat for the deaf led by the wonderfully calm and wise performance by Paul Raci (Supporting Actor nominee) whose uncompromising approach to teaching how to live as a deaf person offers Ruben his best hope for a meaningful future. I can't really say much else without spoiling the film's final act, but the inclusion of the divisive issue of cochlear implants within the deaf community provides the lynchpin that yields the amazing conclusion to this film. Watch this film in a quiet place.",

I also feel like for a movie about deafness and sound, the sound design was sadly not very surprising. I think I wanted to see more experimental and creative use of sound design in the movie.

Unlike movies of its kind, Metal does not hold you in a state of panic for the full length of the film but instead weaves you in and out following the ups and downs of Ruben (played by Riz Ahmed), the recovering addict who loses everything when he becomes deaf due to prolonged sound exposure as a heavy metal drummer.\n\nSomehow, as a woman who has never suffered from addiction or played an instrument in her life or who even enjoys loud music in the car, I was able to strongly identify with Ruben and feel  deep empathy for him even in his fictional existence. \n\nSound of Metal is a must watch.\n\nMore at: https://www.freepressfail.com/category/the-conservative-critic/",

It's by no means exceptional, but that doesn't take away anything from its value and efficiency that, in part, rendered this movie a truly immersive experience. It's Riz Ahmed's bravura performance, though, that gives Sound of Metal resonance that, in turn, made Ruben one of the most relatable movie characters I've witnessed in recent memory. \n\nHis ability to reflect his fluctuating feelings throughout the movie and how he perceives every phase in his new life is simply astonishing. The aching experience Ruben goes through demands a real acting talent to make the audience emotionally connected to the protagonist, but Ahmed proved he's not just a talented actor but also one who's in a total command of his craft. For if it's hard to make the viewer feel what his character feels, it's even harder to transport its mental state to the audience. Here, we don't only get the sense of loss and being stripped of everything that forms every inch of Ruben in a flicker, nor only do we only understand his pressing need to regain what he lost\u2014especially since the possibility hovering in the air\u2014but we see him grappling with the dilemma of whether he should continue his journey of adapting to his new condition as if it was the norm or he should keep clutching onto the flicker of hope that definitely wouldn't help in case of it turned out to be a mere mirage.\n\nFurthermore, the movie also excels in aspects other than its nuanced portrait of its main character, namely is its exploration of deaf community that truly offers new insights. That's mostly because of the effort shown in the meticulous attention to its essential components, most notably the sign language. However, Paul Raci played a major part in that by portraying the leader of this community and a mentor for Ruben. Through his facial expressions during conversations with Ruben, he delineates the professional duties such an occupation demands. We see him monitoring Ruben's progress and interfering according to his understanding of Ruben's character in particular. As for Olivia Cooke, she further proves she's a remarkable young talent that yet to bloom. Playing Ruben's bandmate and girlfriend Lou, she managed to prove how important she's to Ruben as his most great and precious loss and equally as a great help for him to get a better sense of what he has lost and how to cope with that.\n\nThe acting clinic these three immense talents put on here left an indelible impression on me, but disregarding the technical quality would make absolutely no sense. Besides the exquisite sound design, the highly-articulate cinematography truly adds up to the experience. If there's only one issue I have about this movie it would be its failure to maintain the same dramatic heft that was in its first half. As the focus on Ruben's progression through his medical recovery and its consequences slightly overpowered the emotional quality, and hence there was a bit of it lost that even the wrap-up failed to fully retrieve. \n\n(8.5/10)",

Hearing is such a fragile thing, and once it's gone, it's gone forever, so seeing the character of Ruben come to terms with that was incredible.\n\nAs for Riz Ahmed's performance, it was nothing short of extraordinary. You feel his initial anger and confusion, and as his character grows, you find comfort and peace in his silence. It's an emotional rollercoaster as his journey teaches us more about the deaf community and how to live without hearing.\n\nThe supporting cast all do a great job, especially Paul Raci as Joe. But the subplot with Ruben's girlfriend, Lou, did nothing for me. Their relationship was touching, and they have their moments, but I just didn't care for their love story/the tour subplot. I just thought that Ruben's personal journey of learning to live without hearing was more interesting when he was figuring it out on his own.\n\nI was actually blown away by the sound design, which is not something you usually hear in movies. (Pun intended.) Since hearing is such an important part of the film, they use it in so many creative ways. There are even long sections without any words ever being spoken, which made for a more immersive viewing experience.\n\nOn the other hand, the movie can run a little long at 2 hours. They could have probably shaved off like 20 minutes, mostly to do with the girlfriend/tour subplot. But with such an immersive sound design and an excellent performance from Riz Ahmed, this would have definitely made my Top 10 Movies of 2020 list.",

            "content": "As a drummer/percussionist with hearing loss of my own, this film hit me hard.  SOUND OF METAL, directed and co-written by Darius Marder, tells the story about heavy metal drummer Ruben (Riz Ahmed from ROGUE ONE, VENOM and the HBO miniseries \"The Night Of\"), touring in an RV with his girlfriend & singer/guitarist Lou (READY PLAYER ONE's Olivia Cooke).  One night he notices an abrupt hearing loss, and after a few days of devolving hearing Ruben goes to a doctor who tells him he's lost about 80% of his hearing in both ears.  Like nearly all hearing loss, the doctor tells Ruben his hearing can never be restored, and his best bet is to have an operation and get cochlear implants: devices surgically implanted that bypass the damaged ear canal(s) to deliver an electric/mechanized sensation that resembles what humans perceive as sound.  The doc tells Ruben this procedure is expensive ($40-80 thousand), and if you know ANYTHING about working drummers you know Ruben doesn't have that kind of money.\n\nAdding to his troubles, we learn that Ruben is a recovering drug addict: four years sober.  Lou becomes increasingly worried that Ruben will be unable to cope with this devastating news and will relapse.  She contacts his sobriety coach who is able to hook him up with half-way type situation for deaf recovering addicts.\n\nThe bulk of this film is Ruben both learning how to live with deafness (Joe, who runs the rural deaf recovery house, stresses that deafness is NOT a handicap, and instead is something that Rueben needs to learn to adjust to), while also learning how to adjust to a new \"him.\"  The direction is really well done: the situation isn't meant to feel like a super downer for Ruben (obviously the situation is, but the film doesn't dwell on it like some grand tragedy), and all of the performances are on point.  Ahmed's  drumming is done in a way to seem believable and to mask the fact that Ahmed is, well, an actor and not a drummer.  This is a minor point, of course, but if the movie is about a drummer the actor needs to be believable as a working drummer, and Ahmed, as well as the director and editor, accomplish that task.  Too often I get annoyed when movies about drummers feature actors who _barely_ look like they can convince non-drummers they're competent, let alone excelling (I'm looking at you THAT THING YOU DO, WHIPLASH, ROCKSTAR, and many others).  This is obviously my own (any likely other drummers) problem, but it should be commended that SOUND OF METAL does a good job of portraying Ruben as a good drummer through solid 'acting' by Ahbed and subtle (maybe not obvious to the laymen, but obvious to this dummer) editing and film shooting techniques.\n\nI've lost about 25-30% of my hearing in each ear myself; while I'm fortunate currently to be able to adjust with hearing aids, I have some sort of degenerative affliction that is getting worse, regardless of what I've done/will do to maintain 'safe' listening environments.  I don't gig anymore like I did as a teenager/young-20 something adult but I am music teacher constantly around bands and percussion ensembles.  I'd noticed my hearing devolving for probably at least 15 years before I _FINALLY_ did something about it: I waited until I had turned 40, thinking \"well - I guess 40 is kind of old so it's time to get a hearing aid like grandpa\" or something.  This adjustment has been difficult at times, but easily one of the best decisions of my life.\n\nI say this only to underscore the difficulties Ruben has, going from a nightly-drumming professional musician to suddenly unable to hear a conversation from his girlfriend, let alone continue pursuing his passionate work.  Riz Ahmed does an INCREDIBLE job portraying this character & his hearing loss.  You can feel the confusion, pain, and frustration every step of the way.  Ahmed is a music performer in his own right, releasing several wrap albums over the last decade or so.  I'm sure he was able to draw on his own passions as a performer in order to portray the pains and frustrations of Rueben being unable to drum.\n\nBut, really, the sadness and frustration is mostly the first Act of SOUND OF METAL.  At the recovery house Joe hooks Ruben up with a class of children, where Ruben interacts with kids, becomes comfortable learning American Sign Language (ASL), and starts teaching the kids basic drumming.  Seeing Ruben start to come alive in his current situation is a legit joy!  When Ruben catches up with Lou, and sees she's pursing her own music passions elsewhere, Ruben decides to sell off his drums and recording equipment to have the cochlear implant surgery.\n\nThe film centers around Ruben trying to find himself instead of chasing what is in the past.  SOUND OF METAL has (inadvertently) become an incredible metaphor for living in the COVID/post-pandemic world.  Those who are still trying to live with the habits of January 2020 in January 2021 are going to be miserable: lamenting what we used to have and what we used to be able to do.  Myself, I've gone from producing award-winning percussion ensembles, and co-producing various types of HS bands (marching, concert, jazz) to moving to a mostly virtual world.  My family used to go to Disneyland regularly, and we haven't seen any family members in person since Christmas 2019.  Like Ruben, it's normal, understandable even, to want to be down that we're in month 10 of a nearly nationwide lock-down from our norms with no end in immediate sight.\n\nRueben gets the implant surgery, but he essentially has to leave the deaf addict recovery house.  Joe stated Ruben shouldn't try to reduce his deafness as a disability that needs to be overcome: he should instead embrace it and learn to adjust.  Ruben defies this ideology, gets the surgery, and then flies out to Europe to see Lou, now living with her wealthy father in Belgium.  But of course Ruben learns quickly that the cochlear implants do not supply \"sound\" the way his brain naturally interprets sound: they \"mimic\" human voice in a metallic, almost robotic voice and there is much distortion for moderate volume sound.  He listens to Lou perform a song, hearing massive distortion throughout, and Ahmed brilliantly captures the moment Ruben realizes \"he could never go back,\" so to speak.\n\nAnother technical aspect I have to give a shout-out to is the sound design.  Through merely sound the filmmakers do an incredible job of conveying the struggles Ruben is going through.  Portraying deafness can be difficult, as most of us are not stone-cold deaf, sitting in stark silence.  There is often some degree of distortion or white-noise (or tinnitus) when the film is portraying Ruben's point of listening, and later in the film after Ruben gets his implants activated, we get a sense for the 'metallic' and distorted (and still quite faint) sound Ruben is experiencing.  Often loud explosions and shootouts garner \"sound effects\" or \"sound effects editing\" Awards, but I think SOUND OF METAL (a clever pseudo-pun of a title, being both the style of music Ruben & Lou play as well as the types of sound Ruben hears with the implants) is deserving of recognition for its brilliant sound design and execution prorating hearing loss + life with cochlear implants.\n\nThe films ends just as the 'new' Ruben begins: when he realizes to let go of trying to hear the way he used to.  He unplugs his implants after hearing the distorted sound of church bells.  This is a great metaphor for what he ALL must do in a post-pandemic landscape.  We have to let go of how things used to be, and how we used to behave (for ex: I doubt I'll shake very many hands ever again) and embrace our \"new normal.\"  As an educator, I've had to learn all sorts of new technology and teaching tools that I plan on implementing into my curriculum for the foreseeable future: regardless of when I'll be able to teach in person to all my students at the same time.  Ruben looks to be on the path to happiness again when he embraces his \"new me,\" and only when we're ready to do the same can be begin our journey to contentment and real joy.",

Everything is written beat for beat, with classic themes, such as acceptance and... oh that's it.  It's very much Oscar material, but mainly because it's simple and doesn't discover anything new.  At 2 hours long, the film doesn't use its scenes efficiently, and chooses to focus on the intricacies of being deaf, rather then the prominent theme of being good enough on your own. Because of this I can really only commend this film for being a great education on what being deaf is like. Overall, I would recommend watching. 7/10",

Director Darius Marder does a wonderful job putting the audience in Ruben's shoes while at the community. Immersing the audience into how it feels to not only be deaf, but being the newcomer in a foreign environment. Naturally, Ruben runs the gamut of emotions from frustration of not knowing sign language and being excluded from every activity upon his arrival, to isolation, anger, loneliness, and heartbreak. A gutting movie about self-reliance and self-sufficiency with strong performances all around.

This is not just about heavy metal drummer Ruben (Riz) or deafness or addiction or his girlfriend -- his duo's singer, Lou, who more screams than sings. I almost quit the movie early on, as it was just loud noise. But it was just brilliant scene setting, suggesting there is too much noise for all of us and not just  aural noise. The noise did harm Ruben and made him deaf. And not just the heavy metal noise, but all the noise in his life, the heroin he kicked four years ago, the constant on-the-road in a big RV. He went from hearing to deaf in an instant. And a doc told him the hearing wasn't coming back, though a cochlear implant could bring back some hearing but was expensive. He opted to try a group home run by a deaf Vietnam vet, as Lou had to leave to let the program work. We find she grew up here after originating in Paris, as her parents split up not long after, and Mom took her to the states and Mom finally killed herself,  which apparently pissed Lou off enough to spend her nights in the tiny band, screaming at the top of her lungs, playing metal guitar loud as Ruben  played the drums loud, he also  pissed off, having been raised by a single mom and at some point gotten hooked on heroin. The vet who tries to get him to a quiet place, no noise, where he can be at peace with himself and therefore his god, cuts him loose from the program, where no one is seen as handicapped even though deaf, as Ruben opts to try to fix it with the implant, after selling all he has for the operation. He gets some hearing back, heads for Lou, now in Paris, and they agonizingly and in not so many words decide their relationship and indeed their lifestyle is over. At the end Riz decides to take off the implant, to remove the sound he gets from the metal appliance, and just sit in silence maybe for a long time. We all adapt as we age to literal hearing loss or hip malfunction or fighting heart or cancer ailments, some of which we contribute to  ourselves with our own noise. This asks the musical question: Can we adapt and live in peace with the way we are now? Maybe the best thing that happened to Riz, who should win awards for this, is going deaf. It made him take stock of his  angry, noisy life going nowhere, and find a more quiet, peaceful place to reside, in both his decision-making and behavior. The noisy lashing out in anger is no way to live. The deaf's saving grace may well be that they don't have to listen to all the literal and figurative noise out there.",

Its representation of the deaf community is both empathetic and enlightening, and proves that there should be more high-profile films that focus on its members. Riz Ahmed absolutely owns this role in what is possibly 2020's best performance, and is perfectly supported by Olivia Cooke (who is one of my favorite up-and-coming stars) and a phenomenal Paul Raci, who absolutely deserves every trophy he wins this year. The sound design is also some of the most innovative I've ever seen (or I guess heard) in a film, skillfully and authentically recreating the devastating experiences of hearing loss. The direction and screenplay are also spectacular, as both are very minimalist and low-key but ultimately impactful and universally relatable.

The movie's about a drummer that loses his hearing after forcing himself to perform too much, and gets to know the world differently as a deaf person as a result. Let's get the first things out of the way, the movie is really well made. I really enjoyed Marder's direction here, providing us with some really good visuals. The cinematography is good, and the tone of the movie is direct and straight to its point. The acting is indeed really great, Ahmed showing his range in here, as well as his sign language, drumming and american accent. What this movie really nails is the mixing and overall sound. Since they worked with actual deaf people on set, they knew how important it was to get this aspect right, and so they did. The moments of silence and the muffled sound when the camera closes on the protagonist feel so real and it really puts you in the position he's in, which is great in this type of film, and hands down my favorite aspect here. The plot though, is a little bit messy to begin with. We get little background on our characters here, apart from a brief backstory for some of them. Our main character's past is an enigma, hell, we don't even know how old he is. That's not a big issue here, since the point of the film is the matter at hand and that is losing his hearing. Towards the middle of the movie there's a time jump, suggested by a few shots of landscapes and skies. With that time jump we lose a pretty big chunk of character development for our protagonist, seeing him go from being rejective to Joe to being in complete harmony with everyone. I wish we could've seen how he got to the point where he started to fit in, it would have given some nice depth to Ruben. One of my favorite characters in this movie is Paul Raci's Joe. We get some background on him, and he is established as Ruben's guide to understandng his situation. Again, the fact that this film used real deaf people made this all the more believeable and enjoyable to watch. I did enjoy this movie, despite the slow pacing and some things that went unasnwered and unmentioned. I would say this is one of the better movies of 2020, with a really good message especially with the ending, which I really liked. Sound of Metal is a good watch, one I'd recommend to anyone who likes a good drama. But I doubt the rewatchability of this, and for more critical people, the aspects I've mentioned might take from the overall enjoyment of this movie.",

            "content": "\"Sound of Metal\" (USA, 2019) is a drama, directed by Darius Marder (Place Beyond the Pines) and written with the also director Derek Cianfrance (Blue Valentine, Light Between Oceans) that is the author of the story.\n\nThe story follows Ruben, the drummer of a Death Metal band, that plays and lives in a van with his girlfriend and vocal Lou on small gigs, and is starting a career.. Suddenly he starts to lose his auditions, and the movie shows the struggle in his life to adapt to the situation and search for help, with the possibility of recovery with a cochlear implant surgery, but not having the money to do the surgery. All the stressful situation leads to a separation of the couple, with Lou continuing the gig and Rubin reluctantly agreeing to seek help in a deaf community to better learn to deal with the handicap.\n\nThe plot is intense on emotions, and shows in a realistic way the drama of losing the sense that was essential to Rubin - all the story revolves around this character, and especially from the middle to the end of the movie, the personal drama intensifies, even with the contemplative silence that occupies most of the film, or the sounds of the implant that he acquires later. The scenes that show the adaptation in the community(that uses deaf actors) is absolutely great.\n\nThe movie has Riz Ahmed as Ruben Stone (Rogue One, Nightcrwaler, The OA,The Night Of), Olivia Cooke as Lou Berger and Paul Raci as Joe (interesting that he had a deaf father in real life). Riz is just awesome on the paper, that involves showing the emotions, despair and anger to the silent parts of the individual learning, dealing and acceptance of the situation. Indeed something that deserves the prizes and indications for best male performer. The def community used deaf actors and that elevated the veracity of the story.\n\nThe cinematography by Dani\u00ebl Bouquet (Nothing persona, Kaubow) is pretty competente, taking a more realistic like approach, with a nervous camera, focusing very well on expressions and situations that are really important in the context. Another great detail is the sound department, with the sound of deafening sense and later with the implant sounds transmitting well the sense and situation of the protagonist that leads to such emotions that he feels. \n\nOverall a great drama, with an intriguing and engaging story, without the load of melodrama that depicts in a realistic way the situation and the study of the protagonist, with the help of an excellent performance and use of sound department on the production. A solid 7,5 out of 10.",

She's definitely got problems and then all the screaming during their live show. I'm sorry, but Lou looks so ridiculous with her bleached eyebrows lol. \n\nGod damn, it must feel terrifying to start losing your hearing all of a sudden. Especially if what you love doing in life and your career require it. Fucking brilliant how they used different effects and sounds to show what it would feel like to suddenly start losing your hearing. The frustration and anxiety one must feel, I can't imagine. \n\nWow, it's almost as if he's living in a completely different world now where the language everyone speaks is foreign to him. Real sweet seeing him adapt and accept his new life of being deaf and building a relationship with the kids. Kids can bring out the best in you. Holy shit, that was crazy how they just cut to him getting the implant surgery. Kind of sad to see how Lou moved on with her life and Ruben is still trying to hold on to what they had when they were touring and living in the RV. The deaf community place was his new home, that was his new world where he eventually learned to adapt and be happy. \n\nJeez, what a depressing song to sing for one's birthday. It's almost like she doesn't like singing the song but is forced to sing it. So sad when he tells Lou that it's ok. That was the official moment when they disbanded the band and went on with their lives. I'm glad he was able to find peace at the end. Now he can movie on with his life. Who knows what he'll do next. Will he go back to the deaf community or move on to unknown territory. My guess is he'll go back since what he was seeking the whole time was the familiar, what he already knew. He came to terms with his new life and accepted it for what it is. \n\nI already knew going in that this was going to be one of those hard-hitting dramas, and boy did it hit hard. This movie gave me anxiety. Smartly written and powerfully acted. All the nuances and subtleties definitely didn't go unnoticed. Beautiful character development. Very impressive how Riz actually learned not only the drums, but also sign language. Watching this movie, I couldn't help but feel thankful that I have my hearing and my sight and all other senses intact. We kind of take for granted these things and it's always nice to be reminded of how fortunate and lucky we are. Extremely sobering and definitely impactful movie. This movie's a bit too real for my taste though, so I don't think I'm watching it again.",

His use of sound brought to life the reality of someone like Ruben losing not only his sense of hearing, but the stability of the life that he had put together with Lou. It also shows how much can be expressed without sound, without actual speech.  \nWe see a segment of our population I very rarely see now, which I find odd. Lead character Ruben is told by Joe at the support group that for himself and the other deaf members, their condition is one to accept and  learn to live with rather than something that defines and controls them, and certainly not something one must fix. But Ruben doesn't want to hear this; or at least he doesn't really listen to what it means. \nJoe is played by Paul Raci, who is great, even though he spends much of the movie looking like Michigan J. Frog in front of strangers. Olivia Cooke as Lou is always so good. This last year or so has been heard reward for all the hard work and skill she has shown in other works, from Bates Motel to Thoroughbreds and Little Fish. \nBut this is Riz Ahmed's movie. Since seeing him in The Night Of, it was clear how good he was already. I've known some guys like Ruben- headstrong punk guys, hot-headed, struggling with accepting change.  Ahmed  shows us all of that in a brilliant performance. His final scene with Cooke, as they both are admitting the reality of what has changed with them without having to say it is an excellent showcase of acting but also a prime example of 'show, don't tell'. \nIt's so good to see Ruben get that moment of stillness finally. 4 stars",

The two of them are played by Riz Ahmed and Olivia Cooke. She is fantastic in one of the film's several remarkable supporting parts, but the true star of the film is Ahmed in a career highlight, effortlessly creating a compelling, relatable protagonist and  driving the story forward with his enormous emotional range.\n\nIn what is essentially a tale of transition, Marder delves into the actual truths of the deaf community with disarming realism, while the film's scope feels personal, yet universal. So unflinchingly honest with its real world subject, no one should miss this gem of a film, which I suspect will age like a fine wine.",

            "content": "In his directorial debut, Darius Marder addresses a subject to which Hollywood hardly pays any attention and which is also not given enough awareness in society. Sound of Metal tells the story of the young drummer Ruben, who is on tour with his girlfriend and pursuing his dream of becoming a musician. Of all things, this passion becomes Ruben's undoing when he suddenly loses most of his hearing. As a result, his life is no longer the same and he embarks on an adventure for which he is not really ready.\n\nRuben is embodied by Riz Ahmed. He is the clear protagonist of the film and appears in every scene. His journey from a dreaming drummer who has the seemingly perfect life with his great love to a deaf depressive who wants to return to that life is fascinating to follow. Ahmed plays this complex character with great subtlety. But he can also boil up from 0 to 100 in some moments and give free rein to his feelings. His multi-faceted performance makes it easy to understand his situation and to sympathise with him. Ahmed totally captivates you and represents people who have suffered the same fate with a lot of dignity. Olivia Cooke, as Ruben's girlfriend Lou, only has a few scenes at the beginning and at the end. Still, it's enough time for Cooke to introduce us to her equally complicated character in a way that we can understand her as a relative. Another terrific performance is delivered by Paul Raci as Joe, Rubens' also deaf mentor. He runs an association for the deaf and acts as a sort of father to the members. He acts very calmly and emotionally, especially in the heart-warming dialogues with Ruben, though there is always a certain toughness and honesty in there. His chemistry with Ahmed is the highlight of the film. As a veteran who has long since come to terms with his situation, he sees himself in the newcomer and wants to show him that deafness is not a curse.\n\nSound of Metal sends an enormously important message and is hopefully a wake-up call towards Hollywood. Over the 120-minute running time, it's clear that this film was a matter of heart for Marder and the ensemble. As a result, much of it lingers for days afterwards. This fact makes the film-experience all the more beautiful and real. Real is the word that best describes Sound of Metal. Every scene seems realistic and probably takes place in real life in exactly the same way. The slow, almost still pacing in the middle of the film can seem boring, but is very important for the film's authenticity. Sound of Metal is a film you have to see to get a slight insight into the life of this fundamental group of people.",

Soothing everyday sounds, like the rustling of the leaves and grass, the drops in the coffee pot in the morning, and the voices of your loved ones, become that more powerful and precious when we switch to a third person's perspective as Riz loses his hearing. They managed to make even the sound of silence have a shape and form so we could experience it as well.\nRiz Ahmed's acting was the highlight of this film and, in my opinion, makes him a strong contender for this year's Oscars nominations. Every single step of his journey through the stages of grief for his loss, we were there with him, feeling every moment, from shock and pain, to anger and acceptance. Olivia Cooke was also amazing, showcasing wonderfully how our pain affects our loved ones who try their hardest to help us. Both managed to make me invested in their story in just a few minutes.\nEven though this was not a true story, it felt like one. It felt like it could be anyone's story about the loss of something, or someone, precious and an exploration of their grieving process. That's an amazing feat for Darius Marder's directorial debut. The Oscars buzz around this movie is well deserved.",

Ahmed gives a wonderfully active, frustrated performance, giving off very human reactions to his character's plight (an understandably imperfect, often pained individual), though the supporting cast is nothing to brush off.

Playing a heavy metal drummer who experiences rapid hearing loss, his initial reaction of furious denial slowly gives way to acceptance of the fact that his life will never be the same way it was before. The film is unique in its portrayal of a person on the outside working his way in. Many scenes have little or no sound in them, and none of the ASL used in the film is captioned, putting us firmly in our hero's shoes and highlighting what a struggle it is adapting to a different world of communication The film is done in such a way that the sound is virtually its own character. Sometimes its loud, other times its quiet Sometimes its slightly muted or slightly exaggerated, and on occasions it simply comes and goes. It flags somewhat in its 3rd act, which suggests to me that the filmmakers had a solid idea for a film, but weren't exactly sure how to bring it to a close. It's still ends on a satisfying note, but its overshadowed by what came before it. It has a strong supporting cast, most of whom are actual members of the deaf community, a decision that's a credit to the movie itself and its intentions, and while its artistic choices might alienate some, I was very happy to see a sensitive portrayal of deafness, done in a manner that makes it very relatable.

He goes into a deaf community to learn and coop without the use of sound. Strong plot. Ruben (Riz Ahmed) is a drum player. And a former drug addict. Stubborn once he discovered he lost his hearing. Desperate to get the hearing implant device but at an expensive cost. He joined a community where he meets a group that teaches him the other way of living around it. Great performances by Riz Ahmed. Olivia Cooke. And Lauren Ridloff who plays a teacher for a class of deaf children. One thing i did not like was the movie was a bit slow moving in the third act. Dragging out the exposition.

            "content": "I don't think I've better empathized with hearing loss and deafness than with Sound of Metal, a moving and observant drama about a heavy metal drummer quickly losing his sense of hearing. Riz Ahmed (Nightcrawler) plays Ruben, a former junkie who is four years sober and worried about losing his girlfriend/band mate (Olivia Cooke) with his recent diagnosis. He's attending a treatment center meant to cater to a deaf community and transition others into this community. Ruben is defiant, depressed, angry, all the stages you can imagine with grief. The movie is at its best during its quiet and contemplative moments where we empathize with the terror and alienation of Ruben. When he first joins the center, we don't get subtitles for the many signed conversations between members. It's only after Ruben learns ASL, integrates into the community, and opens himself up to the program that we too get to be knowledgeable. The sound design is exceptionally utilized to illustrate Ruben's changing perspective, and some later choices with it might make you long for the peacefulness of silence. The movie is exquisitely thoughtful and considerate while maintaining a subtle, character-driven approach that keeps things grounded from wallowing in self-pity. For many of the deaf, hearing loss isn't seen as a disability but a community with its own culture and quality of life. It's understandable that Ruben is focused on loss but the movie doesn't dwell in loss, more so transformation and acceptance. Ahmed is fabulous in the lead role which requires him to rely primarily upon non-verbal expression for extended periods. His eyes are his best vessel for communicating Ruben's emotional state, and Ahmed is sensational. Paul Raci is also great as the leader of the treatment center and the responsibility and generosity he feels to those in his care. Sound of Metal is an immersive, sensitive, authentic and poignant drama with an Oscar-caliber lead performance and a depth of compassion for the many people of the deaf community.\n\nNate's Grade: B+",

The creative choice to have the audience experience silence along with the main character on many occasions was very impactful. I will also say that the lead actor did a wonderful job and his performance shined through even with what I would say was a lackluster script. First of all, this movie was supposed to be about metal music, but there was no metal music to be found which is not surprising because Hollywood wouldn't know metal/rock music if it was in front of their faces. Secondly, when Ruben goes to the doctor for the first time and finds out he is going deaf he never truly gets an answer for why. He gets multiple reasons for why he MIGHT be, but no definitive answers as to why he so suddenly lost his hearing. All he wanted and was fixated on was surgery to get his hearing back which he knew was very expensive and didn't even ask more questions about how things might sound after the surgery. He assumed he would go back to hearing the same way he did before. This is where I think the depiction of the deaf experience faltered. There would be more conversations between the doctor and patient. I also have a problem with the lack of dialogue about Rubens passion for music. The movie was supposed to be about a passionate musician losing his hearing. How come he never got a monologue where he spoke about wanting to hear again because of his love for music? All he kept saying was, I want to get the surgery. But why? Almost everything in this movie was left for the audience to infer. They barely let the girlfriend speak as well. In the end, I thought it was VERY predictable. I knew after he got the surgery it was either not going to work or he would taking the hearing aids off and that's exactly what he did and the movie just abruptly ends. What will he do next? More for the audience to infer. The critics love movies like this, but for me it was two hours worth of mediocre.",

            "content": "Rating: A\n\n\"With moderately high expectations, Sound of Metal genuinely surprised me. Darius Marder and Abraham Marder's exquisite screenplay is the absolute standout, at the same insanely good level as Riz Ahmed's impressive performance. The former holds a meaningful, enlightening story about not only the deaf community but also about accepting our limitations as something that's a part of us instead of taking it as a handicap. Except for a couple of unnecessary scenes that could have made the movie a bit shorter, the two-hour duration is quite fair, boasting a very captivating narrative.\n\nCountless storytelling technical details elevate this film into one of the best of the year. From an apparently simple yet extremely clever use (or absence) of subtitles for sign language to emotionally compelling dialogues, an outstandingly realistic atmosphere surrounds the movie throughout the entire runtime. Never, not even for a second, the viewer needs to deal with an over-the-top reaction, cheesy conversation, or a typical Hollywood, overdramatized moment. Darius Marder has terrific control of the tone, keeping it exceptionally grounded.\n\nRiz Ahmed delivers what I believe is his career-best display, incorporating his character's hearing disability in a seamless fashion. His subtle facial expressions and body movements are essential for the performance that can easily guarantee him dozens of nominations. Olivia Cooke (Lou) is also excellent in her role. Technically, huge praise to Dani\u00ebl Bouquet's cinematography, which insists on an almost documentary-style composition by applying standard camera angles and shots often seen in this type of feature, helping to generate the before-mentioned authenticity.\n\nOne of my absolute favorite films of 2020.\"",

A heavy-metal drummer's life is thrown into freefall when he begins to lose his hearing. \n\nThis is one of the mundane drama, like Manchester by the Sea, where we follow the main character dealing with his/her life like a real person. There's very little background music. Also, there's no big movie twist that would wow the audience. It's simply just a man trying to deal with situations in his life. \n\nRiz Ahmed's performance as a drummer was real and made me care about the character. Since the story followed the drummer, often the sound in the movie reflected how the drummer heard, and this gave perspective on how a deaf person hears. There were little conversations, and many of them were sign languages, which didn't have translations, which confused me a bit in some scenes. \n\nOverall, a mundane and somewhat educational movie about dealing with being deaf. 8/10",

The female lead was very underwhelming though - her part consisted of her looking worried and confused and sleeping.  Moving onto Act 2, this is where the movie slowed way down, and meandered through many scenes that I think were meant to show the main character's growth (I'm not sure exactly), and then we barely got to the beginning of Act 3, where the crisis happens to threaten the main character's progress.  The only character that was provided any depth was Ruben (and perhaps the manager of the rehab facility, but just barely).  There could have been so many chances to show relationships that Ruben had there, but the people living there were just treated as bystanders to Ruben's story, which wasn't all that interesting.

            "content": "Evocative as hell, \u2018Sound of Metal' gets high marks for using the medium to maximum effect in illustrating metal drummer Ruben's grapple with imminent deafness. The sound design is astounding; it captures the alienation, the disorientation, and the discovery of his circumstances in ways I couldnt've imagined and the effect is exciting, terrifying, and heartbreaking all at once.\n\nRiz Ahmed nails the behavioral sand traps that keeps someone clinging and clawing at the bubble they're fixated on preserving. The tumultuous lengths to which he will go to combat his deafness echo his heroin addict past; I tragically saw much of Ruben in someone I used to know. We can all be soul-deep addicts in our own way to something or another in our lives and the pain and confusion when you feel like you are being ripped from your identity can be all-consuming. How do you battle for air when you're violently drowning?\n\nThis profound journey says a lot all at once and Darius Marder (alongside his brother and Derek Cianfrance) brilliantly scripts an arc that works on multiple levels - allegorically, spiritually, technically, humanely, all the ways. What often moved me throughout this was not necessarily what I was seeing directly on screen, but the implications of it all.\n\nIt's invigorating to see the thriving lives and relationships of a deaf community credibly explored and Paul Raci is memorably tender as Joe, the recovery leader and beating heart of the tight-knit society. His performance, alongside Ahmed and Olivia Cooke - who's coping with her own aching past - screams awards consideration.\n\n'Metal' captures well that for Ruben, like so many of us, you can't be pushed to someone else's vision of acceptance; the truest form is a result of your unique, albeit stumbling journey, when you evolve organically from the steps (and missteps) you take. It's a long, difficult road, but Ruben shifts the narrative of his life from bemoaning what he's losing to embracing what he's gaining. Moving, eternal stuff. And the closing shot encapsulates a catharsis well-earned.",

            "content": "Change can be difficult.  So this is about a heavy metal drummer named Ruben (Riz Ahmed).  His life is about to be thrown through a loop when he starts to lose his sense of hearing.  He has no choice but to figure something out posthaste.  Now I went into this movie fully expecting it to deliver.  It's a morose premise for sure, but I had already heard rumblings about how great this was.  It has been a weak year due to COVID, so I was hopeful that this could be one of the best movies of the year.  Unlike a whole laundry list of films before it, Sound of Metal did not disappoint.  Now right away, I was vibing with this movie, and it is because it reminded me of one of my favorite movies of all time: The Wrestler.  They share several similarities: you have this skill set that gets shunned by the people who consider themselves refined, a protagonist who shouldn't be pursuing this career any longer for health concerns, and a desire to do whatever it takes to recapture the glory days.  There are also powerhouse leading performances in both films, and I will be shocked if I see acting that impresses me more than Riz Ahmed when I'm putting together my year-end wrap-up.  Even though the story doesn't spend a ton of time on it, you get a real sense of what kind of people he and his partner are right out of the gates, his partner played expertly by Olivia Cooke.  Not only is she his bandmate, but they are in a romantic relationship as well, so there are stakes presented very early on.  This problem is one that you can't ignore and hope that it goes away; you must take action, and you, of course, sympathize with his plight.  In true underdog fashion, you want to see him rise and overcome, but there are only so many options that you would have in this scenario.  You still want to watch how this will play out, and whenever I felt any lulls here, the story came back with an even harder emotional beat.  Sound of Metal is one of the very few must-see movies released this year.  You have to prepare to have your heart ripped out, and it is all too easy to put yourself into Ruben's shoes in this scary situation.  You will find energy and intensity in just about every scene, but even when it slows down for a quieter moment, the emotional charge is still palpable.  I thought the sound design to this was incredible, and you have to give kudos to how this movie handled deaf representation.  It only took twelve months into 2020, but I can finally recommend to you my first five-star movie of the year.",

            "content": "Darius Marder's \"Sound of Metal\" is an intimate, gripping and heartbreaking disability drama that sheds light on the experiences of marginalized deaf communities. With his directorial debut, writer/director Darius Marder has crafted an authentic account of a heavy-metal drummer that rapidly loses his hearing. It's the filmmaker's first attempt to humanize the lives of deaf musicians, but he pulls it off seamlessly. Using captivating cinematography, Marder draws viewers into the world of a musician that struggles to cope with hearing loss. From intimate close-ups to stunning establishing shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's setting. Marder uses impeccable sound design to recreate the experience of hearing loss, effectively shifting between deaf and normal audio. It is hard to not praise the powerful performances from the cast. Riz Ahmed delivers his finest performance to date as Ruben Stone. With mesmerizing expressions, he conveys the frustrations, disillusionment and self-denial of a heavy-metal drummer that struggles to come to terms with his loss of senses. The supporting cast, which includes the heartfelt Paul Raci, is also excellent and worthy of awards-recognition. Although \"Sound of Metal\" is undeniably an immense technical achievement, ultimately it is not a flawless film. If there's a minor drawback to the movie, it suffers from a slow pace that tests the viewer's patience. Moreover, its sensitive themes may not appeal towards everyone. Nevertheless, fans of disability dramas will definitely enjoy \"Sound of Metal\" and so will movie-goers seeking heartfelt entertainment. At a time when deaf communities are rarely represented in films, it's a stirring reminder of the power of Cinema as an auditory art-form for telling disability stories.",

With incredible performances, scripting grounded in realism, sensitive direction, and gripping sound design, 'Sound of Metal' tells a story that as many as 400,000 Americans each year may experience - the process of sudden hearing loss. Riz Ahmed's central performance as Ruben, a drummer who in an instant loses his hearing, is imbued with a deep emotional complexity that is complemented by innovative sound design - Ruben's panic, rage, despair, fear, and isolation are palpable as you watch him negotiate, and and eventually begin to grow in, his new reality of muffled silence. There are some scenes that make you want to reach through the TV and hug and comfort this man as his world falls apart around him, and again as he puts it back together. Olivia Cooke and Paul Raci are well matched with Ahmed in their supporting roles, the former as Ruben's deeply committed yet troubled love interest, and the later as a leader of an organization that supports the deaf. This film gives voice to a community rarely seen in film, and gifts awareness and empathy to it's viewers. It is certainly one of the most affecting, intimate films of the year.",

            "content": "Riz Ahmen is Ruben, a drummer in a hard rock \"band\" (which is just him and his girlfriend, Oliva Cooke).  They share a strangely quiet, gentle existence living out of an old Air Stream and travelling the country.  Their music is loud and angry; their lives are restrained.  We learn that Ruben is a recovering addict and we soon learn that he is suddenly and quickly losing his hearing.  It's a devastating diagnosis.  To lose his hearing is to make who he thinks he is (a drummer & overall musician) nearly impossible.  He is encouraged to go to a home for newly deaf adults who are also addicts.  (One of the faults of the movie is that we aren't told exactly why or how this decision is reached.  One day, he's just going there.)  Ruben works to fit in and gradually finds a place for himself.  But in the back of his mind, all this is a \"holding pattern\" while he tries to come up with the funds to get a cochlear implant to regain his hearing.\n\nAhmed is never less than amazing.  The awards season recognition he's getting is well-deserved.  He is pretty quiet through most of the movie, yet never totally peaceful.  He is a deeply decent person, even gentle...yet he has demons he must wrestle with.  Ahmed can convey these battles and contradictions just by sitting there and letting us see his face and eyes.  You can feel how cheated he reckons himself to be.  You can see when he's drawn to simple things like teaching a deaf child how to drum his hands rhythmically.  You can see his battle to contain his anger and confusion.  His first \"AA\" meeting at the center, where everyone speaks in a sign language he hasn't begun to learn yet, is quite arresting because you can see how overwhelming it all it, yet he barely moves.  His performance is worth seeing, 100%.  (I would also point out that the sound design is EXCELLENT and so critical.\n\nBut the events of the movie are shown so frustratingly.  We have no real idea of how much time is passing?  When he learns sign language, has it been a week or a year?  Olivia Cooke's character (and performance?) give us almost nothing to go by.  We initially like her because Ruben does, but we really don't know her at all, and the script and actor give us little to go by.  And strangely, as arresting as Ahmed's performance is, I found myself not actually caring all that much about how everything turned out.  Key events in the character's journey seem to be skipped.  Major plot points (and there aren't many) are presented in a sketchy manner.  It all led to a movie that feels like less than the sum of its parts.\n\nBy all means, see if just for Ahmed's performance.  But I think the film itself is SO specific (a rock drummer addict who is suddenly deaf and must adjust but also wants surgery because he thinks it will be a cure-all to return him to his old life) that it forgets to clarify things that those of us who haven't had this specific experience are sometimes left in the dark.  It's an overall miss for me.",

The film is anchored in Riz Ahmed, from beginning to end. Not since There Will Be Blood, have I felt so bound to a lead's performance. This is largely due to the technical aspect, the presence of Day Lewis' face in nearly every frame of Anderson's Blood, and in Metal, the hand held camera and careful sound design drawing us continuously between Ruben's hearing experience and hearing all levels of sound available to a fully functioning ear and it's inner parts. If the duty of art is to make us see beauty, to make us hear beauty, to make us aware of the beauty all around us, then Sound of Metal succeeds. One circumstance in which cinema shines is when and where a condition of synesthesia is created; the sort of complete experience that is simultaneously disorienting and illuminating for a viewer. Sound of Metal, in moments, brings us there to the cusp. It's a simple movie, there aren't big set pieces or shocking narrative turns, but within each moment, there's a certain high level of authenticity which makes the film feel like a Dardenne Brothers experience, and this sort of docu-approach feels right for the subject matter. With a cameo from The Diving Bell and The Butterfly's Mathieu Amalric and strong work from Olivia Cooke and Paul Raci, this little film packs some strong punches. Where it fails to outwardly wow and entertain, it will at least inwardly illuminate, warming your heart even as it breaks.",

Not many.\n\nMy Story (Review Below)\nI lost my hearing in my right ear in my early 30's. Some weird thing they can't cure called Meniere's Disease. 20 years later and three months ago, my good ear started crapping out and I was told I have bi-lateral Meniere's. Not good. \n\nI wasn't a drummer (practiced to be one though). I went to metal/rock shows before COVID, and I wear ear plugs now when I go. I can't personally speak to what it's like to be in the music business, but I can speak to what it's like to go deaf all of a sudden. \n\nJust as in the movie, I wake up and hear a loud humming with everything else a dull murmur. Even my own voice. \n\nI was told hearing aids could help -- I was lucky that I had a family benefactor who offered to pay for the best of the best as they are not covered by insurance. \n\nAnd they helped -- a little, but for the price they barely did squat. Sounds were shrilly like you had an AM radio with a bad speaker in your ear. I need to put subtitles on all movies I watch these days. \n\nBut having trauma in your life reminds you of the importance of connections. Friends and family that support you, or people you barely even know -- like my Letterboxd friends in the comments section. What a great community we have here. \n\nSound of Metal Review\nI went in without reading the byline, expecting an expose on life in the hard rock music business. Instead it's a tragic situation of the young drummer of a metal band, played fantastically by Riz Ahmed, who goes deaf. \n\nThe acting is fantastic. Riz Ahmed is great as usual but reaches a new level . His girlfriend Olivia Cooke is unrecognizable with the bleached eyebrows, moving refreshingly from trash horror movies to a fantastic dramatic effort. \n\nThere's more to say but I need to digest this more and possibly do a rewatch. \n\nAmazing.",

Darius Marder has directed one film and co-written another, but this is HIS film.  There are some elements that didn't quite work, but it all pales in comparison to how spot on Marder gets what it's like to feel deaf.  I kept reading from deaf people how this movie gets it.  It certainly got me.  I felt like i was the one who had lost my hearing and that is a credit to the brains behind the film.  This film has the PERFECT ending. Final Score: 8.6/10",

This film has everything. It has drama, romance, music and more. \n\nWhen something gets taken away from someone's life or when something gets to an end in someone's life, it could mean the beginning of a new thing, a better thing, a better life. A life where you will find yourself, your true self, you will start to feel every little detail around you, you will start to be grateful, you will see things differently, you might start to like things that you always thought that you might not like. Being deaf or blind or whatever doesn't mean your life stops or ends there, it doesn't mean that something is wrong with you, it doesn't mean that you can't do anything. You don't have to fix it, you just have to fix your \"MIND\" if you think that way. THIS IS SOUND OF METAL and that's why I love this film. The film is about life, love, accepting & loving your life whether it was good or bad, being grateful, feel and absorb everything and every moment around you and never give up. \n\nSound mixing & Sound editing were perfect. Alongside Ahmed's great performance, the sound mixing & sound editing were showing exactly how Ahmed's character Ruben Stone, hears every single thing around him. It is like we the audience, are Ruben Stone. We are feeling what he is feeling and hearing what he is hearing. Loved how sometimes everything goes completely silent where we don't hear any single noise, and sometimes we hear everything that's going around him. The film shifts back and forth through that to show the difference. hats off to everyone in this department who worked on it and got us this beautiful result.\n\nIn addition, The directing & cinematography were absolutely amazing, they were portraying the different aspects of Ruben Stone's life in a creative and unique way. \n\nThe film has a very great screenplay that is very well written. Some scenes will really touch your heart and they have a really deep meaning behind them. The film is also filled with quotes about life that are really deep. \n\nRiz Ahmed's performance was amazing and he was able to play Ruben Stone very very well. Really can't imagine someone else other than him to play Ruben. I really don't know what to say much about his performance other than, IT IS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE YEAR. Although Olivia Cooke did not have much time on screen, she was able to give a great performance as well.\n\nIn conclusion, Sound of Metal is one of the best movies I have ever seen, I \"HIGHLY RECOMMEND\" every to watch it as soon as possible. It is new, unique, creative, emotional, genuine. It is just everything. \n\nMy rating is: 9/10",

This movie is powered by a great lead performance from Riz Ahmed who is becoming more and more of a talent to keep an eye out for with every project he does.

I also really liked how the movie used the sound design to allow the viewer to get inside the character's head and ultimately understand his frustration. The movie feels very realistic, so a lot of the tone is pretty low-key, but I think it mostly works for the story it is trying to tell. Overall, this is a good movie that is boosted by a fantastic lead performance from Riz Ahmed.",

            "content": "I'm very wary when it comes to screenplays, specifically when a first-time writer knocks it out of the park because I then find myself having a preconceived notion that they will always be that good. To me, one of the absolute best films of 2012 was The Place Beyond the Pines. Until now, writer/director Darius Marder hadn't really done anything of note since his contribution to the screenplay for that aforementioned film. Well, he has now made a film of his own, both writing and directing, and he's now two for two in my book because Sound of Metal is a fantastic piece of indie filmmaking. Now available on-demand, here's why Sound of Metal more than warrants your time.\n\nBeginning with a concert scene that expresses just how passionate Ruben (Riz Ahmed) is about drumming, it doesn't take long before the film sends his life into a downward spiral. Losing his love of music due to his now gradual and rapid hearing loss, Ruben must come to terms with the fact that he may never be able to hear again. Trying to find peace and solace after years of drug addictions, this is the final, and biggest test of his life yet. From the very first moments, I was sucked into this film, but Ahmed's performance also helped with that, because it's honestly one for the ages. I have seen him many times over at this point, but his commitment to this character floored me. There were multiple occurrences, even though I couldn't relate to the character, that I felt the pain he was going through. This also leads me to the use of sound design.\n\nFrom the overly loud opening to the near-silent portions of the film, the sound design was one of the biggest characters here. I have to give major props to the entire sound department. There are times where it seems natural that we would be hearing things the way Ruben is, but then the film shifts back and forth in order to show the difference. On top of that, there are moments where not a single noise or music queue is heard at all, which made for a much more engaging film in my opinion. His performance, along with how the sound design reflected it, was simply perfect.\n\nFilms that revolve around a likeable character who has to overcome insane odds are very difficult for me to dislike unless it's just poorly made, so I'm slightly biased for stories like these. With that said, as much as a loved this film, I can't quite call it perfect because the portions of the film that were dead silent are both the best and worst parts of the movie in terms of pacing. Yes, I was engaged from start to finish, but the quiet elements sometimes brought the film to a halt. In retrospect, I still enjoyed all of those moments as well, but that, in particular, is what is keeping me from giving this one a perfect score.\u00a0\n\nOverall, Sound of Metal was easily one of my most anticipated films of this year simply due to who was writing and directing. This is the type of film that has talent littered throughout. Whether you're talking about the wonderful central performance by Ahmed, Olivia Cooke's great supporting role, or even the calm and collected performance that Paul Raci gives as Joe, never once did I question the acting here. Although I haven't had the chance to see a lot of editor Mikkel E.G. Nielsen's work, I will absolutely be keeping an eye on him in the years to come, because his work here inspired me. I loved nearly everything about this film and it's easily one of my top recommendations for this year. Sound of Metal is a home run.",

This is one of the most touching and well-crafted films I've seen this year, bound to land on many Top 10 lists this year. The sound design of this film is some of the most near-perfect I've ever heard in one of these, from the concert scenes, to the moments we are inside Riz Ahmed's head and experience the loss of hearing alongside the character.\n\nRiz Ahmed gives one of the most powerful, moving performances of the year in this role! The anguish and confusion, anger, just a full range of emotions he displays here and it is a true treat to see. Ahmed has consistently been one of the greatest young actors working today, and in this role, things are no different. Before filming, Ahmed took 6 months of drum lessons, and for the film, he also learned American Sign Language. This film was also shot over just one month \u2013 so to see this as the finished product is incredible. Just as with the film \"Run\" and the casting of its lead paraplegic actor, here, Darius Marder casted numerous people from within the deaf community, adding a very respectful atmosphere, as well as a vital piece of authenticity to this story. Sound of Metal is streaming on Amazon Prime Video right now and I highly recommend checking it out ASAP! All the thumbs up from me.",

At this point you are solidly rooting for him to find peace while witnessing the inevitable last cling to who he was before. \n\nThe last 10 minutes are absolutely beautiful and filled with emotion.

I admired how the movie portrays the deaf community in a more positive light, because in the media it's usually misrepresented, as it often reeks of denial and self-loathing. I can tell a lot of care and effort went into this.\n\nIt's very thought-provoking as well. The main character Ruben (Riz Ahmed) who is a heavy-metal drummer, where his entire life revolves around the world of sound and music, which sadly gets snatched away from him. This devastating part of his life also becomes the thing that would later define him. The silence makes him pause and consider what life can be like when we learn to accept and let things go. Not only accepting the lost of your hearing, but overcoming a nasty drug addiction. By losing apart of yourself isn't always doom and gloom after you let it sit for a while, because it can give you a brand-new perspective on things. You start to conclude that silence is heaven to the ears.\n\nRiz Ahmed delivers a terrific and heart-breaking performance as Ruben. He's the type of actor that does such a great job of making you care for his characters and here is no different. Riz has such intense, and yet expressive eyes that convey so much on what the character is feeling or thinking. Every worry, frustration, sadness, joy, and fear were all felt through his performance.\n\nOlivia Cooke, who I didn't recognize at first, also delivers a great performance as Lou, Ruben's girlfriend. There is nothing more soul crushing than watching someone you love at their lowest point both emotionally and mentally. It makes me wonder why she isn't a bigger star already, because I think she's fantastic.\n\nI like how the movie barely has a score, as the background is often incredibly quiet. The movie opens with a loud heavy metal concert blasting away it's music, but from Ruben's point of view it slowly becomes more muffled and clogged up. It just shows that a great deal of thought went into the audio and that alone made the whole thing effective. The same thing applies to Darius Marder's directing and Dani\u00ebl Bouquet cinematography; fantastic and impactful.\n\nOverall rating: Highly recommend.",

After consulting a doctor he learns the damage is beyond repair. A cochlear implant could help but it's expensive. Lou convinces him to go to a rural deaf community where he learns the life of being deaf. This is where the the bulk of the story takes place as we follow Ruben learning sign language but more importantly learning about himself as he navigates his new world. These scenes are a complete wonder, overflowing with stoic humanity and human empathy. Riz Ahmed is simply sublime as Ruben. His performance is one of such subtle beauty and power it left me floored. Amhed also spent months learning how to drum and also how to sign language, adding an extra layer of authenticity. The film is also a sonic masterpiece, from the opening scene of a ferocious gig to the many scenes where we 'hear' the world through Ruben's ears. We hear the muffled noises, the near silence. It truly envelops us in the film, making for an extra special experience. And the ending is one of the best you will see, a moment of pure harmony. This film I believe is a must see.

Not only is Ahmed's performance in the film a stunning and painful work, but his co-stars, particularly Paul Raci as Joe who invites Ahmed's Ruben to seek help in living with deafness, is genuine, stirring, and uplifting. There is something simply stylish about Sound of Metal that director Darius Marder manages to capture, be it the horrors of hearing loss, the heartache and the climb, or the beauty that we can feel about something that is so truly raw and human. Sound of Metal is a masterpiece of modern cinema, and one of the best films I have ever seen.",

            "content": "CRUNCH TIME - My Review of SOUND OF METAL \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nA good friend of mine, who has a disability, often shares with me his opinions of how cinema has looked at the various challenges as something to fix. He speaks about how through ableism, people get categorized as suffering from a disability rather than living with one. Some in the deaf community, for example, consider those who wish to hear again to be traitors. It's with this in mind that I came to watch Sound Of Metal, the narrative feature debut of Darius Marder (The Place Beyond The Pines), who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Abraham, based on a story by Derek Cianfrance (Blue Valentine). The story concerns a hard rock drummer and addict who experiences hearing loss and enters a rehab center to reconcile with his new state of being. \n\nRiz Ahmed (Nightcrawler) stars as Ruben, the aforementioned drummer who, when the story begins, thrashes out a set with his lead singer/girlfriend Lou (Olivia Cooke) as part of their popular but decidedly small RV tour. Almost immediately, Ruben senses an issue with his hearing, and the fantastic sound design by Nicholas Becker immerses us in Ruben's plight, with high pitches, underwater-style rumblings, and more. We as an audience feel just as disoriented as Ruben, and it's a conceit explored throughout. Without health insurance, Ruben has few choices and cannot afford the cochlear implants a doctor discusses with him. Ignoring the physician's advice, Ruben performs at another show and further damages his sense of hearing. \n\nWhen Lou cancels the tour and leaves Ruben at the door of a rehab facility, you can feel his heartbreak. Ruben clearly lives for music and feels trapped in a hopeless situation. The facility manager, Joe (beautifully played by Paul Raci), takes away Ruben's comforts, including access to his phone, a computer, or anything from the outside world. Slowly, oh so slowly, Ruben learns ASL and finds a place within the deaf community. He befriends people like Jenn (Chelsea Lee), a genderqueer deaf person who oozes confidence, teaching Ruben there is life after a hearing loss. Ruben also has a nice chemistry with one of the teachers, Diane (The Walking Dead's Lauren Ridloff), and what could easily have served as a tired romance trope remains a gentle, platonic relationship. \n\nWe watch Ruben go through the many ups and downs of his hearing loss, from anger to denial to perhaps some unexpected places. Ahmed gives a gentle, soulful performance with flickers of rage when he feels especially unmoored. That the film works at all remains largely due to his commitment to the role. Unfortunately, as soon as the story leaves the rock world, it descends into a sluggish, PSA-quality tale. At the risk of sounding tacky, I think I expected Whiplash and got a concussion instead. The issues of the deaf community no doubt get handled with the utmost of sensitivity, but things sometimes feel a little too nicey-nice to work as drama. Don't get me wrong, some of this has an intensity and really makes you feel Ruben's loneliness. \n\nAdditionally, certain plot strands never pan out, such as the several scenes of Ruben sneaking onto Joe's computer, risking getting caught and expelled from the facility. Same goes for Ruben breaking the rules by entering his RV and selling it. I'm guessing the filmmakers didn't want to goose up the drama, but it results in a certain flatness at times. Olivia Cooke's performance rings true, never seeming like an actor playing a singer, but her character takes a backseat for most of the film. \n\nAfter quite a long slog, the film recovers in its third act with a fascinating plot development and an ending of quiet beauty. Thanks to Riz Ahmed's gorgeous performance, to his journey to accept stillness and peace, and the sensitivity to the deaf community, the final moment honors those living with hearing loss in a simple yet profound way.",

After a boisterous, mid-tour set, one half of a power duo starts to experience aural malfunction. Uh-oh.\n\nIn typical human nature denial, Ruben carries on, but is soon forced to make tough decisions. Scrambling desperately to get back on course, and continue his career, Ruben is eager to gamble on an expensive operation, while his vocalist girlfriend steers him to a recovery community, focusing on adaptation over cure.\n\nReuben's journey, careening between hope, desperation, struggle and revelation, is a fascinating one, amplified by the extraordinary presentation from director Darius Marder. Putting the audience in Reuben's ears the loss experience, through muffled passages, jarring distortions, and worst of all, total silence, is devastating. The eclectic sound design may be the star here. Closed captioned throughout so nothing is missed, the sub-titles, usually a distraction, become a fluid part of the viewing experience.\n\nAs a simple, uncomplicated young man jolted by a life altering shock, Riz Ahmed is terrific in a subtle yet demanding role. He absolutely rocks as a kickass drummer, a reluctant deaf student, and an empathetic partner willing to go any distance to make things right. The buzz about this film is not just in Ruben's ears.\n\n- hipCRANK",

Although most all scenes focus on him; you still feel that you cannot get enough of him because of that range and depth of feeling (& general good looks...love his profile with big eyelashes!).

All of this is brought to life through the fine performances of Riz Ahmed, Olivia Cooke and Paul Raci, as well as an inventive sound design that truly makes an impact on viewers. One of the year's best.",

I admired how the movie portrays theWhoa, where did this movie come from?As soon as the film started, I knew instantly I was in for an emotional ride, and I was right.'Sound of Metal' is a great movie that felt so encouraging and honest. I admired how the movie portrays the deaf community in a more positive light, because in the media it's usually misrepresented, as it often reeks of denial and self-loathing. I can tell a lot of care and effort went into this.It's very thought-provoking as well. The main character Ruben (Riz Ahmed) who is a heavy-metal drummer, where his entire life revolves around the world of sound and music, which sadly gets snatched away from him. This devastating part of his life also becomes the thing that would later define him. The silence makes him pause and consider what life can be like when we learn to accept and let things go. Not only accepting the lost of your hearing, but overcoming a nasty drug addiction. By losing apart of yourself isn't always doom and gloom after you let it sit for a while, because it can give you a brand-new perspective on things. You start to conclude that silence is heaven to the ears.Riz Ahmed delivers a terrific and heart-breaking performance as Ruben. He's the type of actor that does such a great job of making you care for his characters and here is no different. Riz has such intense, and yet expressive eyes that convey so much on what the character is feeling or thinking. Every worry, frustration, sadness, joy, and fear were all felt through his performance.Olivia Cooke, who I didn't recognize at first, also delivers a great performance as Lou, Ruben's girlfriend. There is nothing more soul crushing than watching someone you love at their lowest point both emotionally and mentally. It makes me wonder why she isn't a bigger star already, because I think she's fantastic.I like how the movie barely has a score, as the background is often incredibly quiet. The movie opens with a loud heavy metal concert blasting away it's music, but from Ruben's point of view it slowly becomes more muffled and clogged up. It just shows that a great deal of thought went into the audio and that alone made the whole thing effective. The same thing applies to Darius Marder\u2019s directing and Dani\u00ebl Bouquet cinematography; fantastic and impactful.Overall rating: Highly recommend.",

He's the drummer of a rock duo with his girlfriend who sings and plays the guitar.The problem is that Ruben is beginning to lose his hearing, so he has to accept the situation or to see if there's some way to repair the damage and return to life as he had known it until then.At that point the film becomes a sensory journey for the viewer, because accompanied by its excellent sound design, the film makes us clearly experience the situation that Ruben is facing, because like the character we hear voices and noises as if they were heard underwater.This is essential to the functioning of the film, because it makes you experience even briefly how incredibly difficult their situation is.Ruben is a recovering addict and therefore fearing a relapse he joins a group of deaf people so that Ruben can deal with both issues.Perhaps the script doesn't operate with sufficient force at that point because it doesn't explore in more depth what the experience means for the deaf community. After what I read, about how some in this community consider those who seek surgical remedies as traitors, is when I understood the message of the film better.Because Ruben wants an implant to regain his hearing, but also the film causes you to understand that there is also the possibility of facing this inevitable change and therefore reach acceptance of it.It's not that the movie is trying to romanticize deafness, but rather that even we, who will never understand it 100%, can at least be much more empathetic.Riz Ahmed is great here. This is his best performance since HBO's The Night Of.It's a pity that he didn't receive the necessary credit and that the film went unnoticed, but if you have the chance to watch it, do yourself a favor and do it.",

It's by no means exceptional, but that doesn't take away anything from its value and efficiency that, in part, rendered this movie a truly immersive experience. It's Riz Ahmed's bravura performance, though, that gives Sound of Metal resonance that, in turn, made Ruben one of the most relatable movie characters I've witnessed in recent memory. His ability to reflect his fluctuating feelings throughout the movie and how he perceives every phase in his new life is simply astonishing. The aching experience Ruben goes through demands a real acting talent to make the audience emotionally connected to the protagonist, but Ahmed proved he's not just a talented actor but also one who's in a total command of his craft. For if it's hard to make the viewer feel what his character feels, it's even harder to transport its mental state to the audience. Here, we don't only get the sense of loss and being stripped of everything that forms every inch of Ruben in a flicker, nor only do we only understand his pressing need to regain what he lost\u2014especially since the possibility hovering in the air\u2014but we see him grappling with the dilemma of whether he should continue his journey of adapting to his new condition as if it was the norm or he should keep clutching onto the flicker of hope that definitely wouldn't help in case of it turned out to be a mere mirage.Furthermore, the movie also excels in aspects other than its nuanced portrait of its main character, namely is its exploration of deaf community that truly offers new insights. That's mostly because of the effort shown in the meticulous attention to its essential components, most notably the sign language. However, Paul Raci played a major part in that by portraying the leader of this community and a mentor for Ruben. Through his facial expressions during conversations with Ruben, he delineates the professional duties such an occupation demands. We see him monitoring Ruben's progress and interfering according to his understanding of Ruben's character in particular. As for Olivia Cooke, she further proves she's a remarkable young talent that yet to bloom. Playing Ruben's bandmate and girlfriend Lou, she managed to prove how important she's to Ruben as his most great and precious loss and equally as a great help for him to get a better sense of what he has lost and how to cope with that.The acting clinic these three immense talents put on here left an indelible impression on me, but disregarding the technical quality would make absolutely no sense. Besides the exquisite sound design, the highly-articulate cinematography truly adds up to the experience. If there's only one issue I have about this movie it would be its failure to maintain the same dramatic heft that was in its first half. As the focus on Ruben's progression through his medical recovery and its consequences slightly overpowered the emotional quality, and hence there was a bit of it lost that even the wrap-up failed to fully retrieve.

If you\u2019ve everWhile hanging out with musician friends at shows I noticed that before playing, they all put in earplugs. I wondered why since I thought this would make it difficult for them to hear each other. This was very much not the case. If you\u2019ve ever been to a loud concert, it is way, way louder on stage. So, the premise of Sound of Metal, about a working-class heavy metal drummer whose world is turned upside down by sudden and profound hearing loss, is frighteningly believable. Thankfully, my friends still have their hearing. The path that Ruben, played by Riz Ahmed with one of the best performances of the year, finds himself on is abrupt and unexpected to put it mildly. Likewise, the film never quite goes where you expect, but you believe every moment and every emotion. I wasn\u2019t expecting Sound of Metal to receive 6 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, but I am very happy that it did because I cannot think of many movies from 2020 that I enjoyed more. Faced with the loss of his hearing, his livelihood, and potentially his relationship, Ruben also fears losing his four years of sobriety from heroin. In need of immediate and special help, his girlfriend and bandmate, Lou (Olivia Cooke), takes him to a sobriety house especially for the deaf. The house is run by Joe (Paul Raci), a deaf Vietnam veteran and recovering alcoholic who gives off the impression that his inner peace only came after a hard struggle. He takes Ruben under his wing but tells him that his program is about finding a solution to the problem in his mind, not his deafness. The scenes of Ruben at the deaf sober house and learning how to live without hearing are interesting and very engaging. Director Darius Marder\u2019s gentle approach to the characters and Ruben\u2019s journey gives us the feeling that we are getting a window into a real community with real people, not participating in a kind of cultural tourism.As much as I admire the approach taken by Marder\u2019s direction and the screenplay he co-wrote with his brother Abraham, Sound of Metal works so well because of Riz Ahmed\u2019s performance. This is not a case of an actor showing off their talents by playing a character with a disability. Ahmed plays a full range of emotions but the real pathos comes from his facial expressions, especially his expressive eyes. Most important of all to the movie\u2019s success, he is not afraid to show big vulnerability on screen or show just how afraid and anxious someone in this situation would feel, especially if they were a musician.Though we see Ruben getting on well at the sober house and with the larger deaf community, he still wants to have cochlear implant surgery which he believes will allow him to return to his old life. This is at odds with Joe\u2019s belief that being deaf is not a handicap or something to be fixed and leads to one of the most compelling and affecting scenes of the movie; one that likely earned Ahmed and Raci their Oscar nominations. It is easily one of the best moments in any movie I saw over the last year. I will admit that I was hesitant to watch Sound of Metal at first, despite its positive reviews, because a movie about a young musician going deaf seems like a heavy or even depressing movie. However, Sound of Metal ends up being an uplifting film without delving into melodrama or smarmy sentiment. Every aspect of this movie is low-key, allowing every moment to feel genuine. This is not the kind of movie with twists but it does have unexpected narrative turns which are best left to be discovered along with Ruben. All of the unexpected places, both physical and emotional, the story takes us are what make it memorable. The empathy in the performances from Paul Raci, Olivia Cooke, Mathieu Amalric, and, most of all, Riz Ahmed are what make it so moving. Sound of Metal is something special: a film so seemingly simple but deeply affecting. It is a character study so well executed that it transcends its premise and puts us so in tune with the main character that its final moments become spiritual, or philosophical, depending on your inclination.",

This drama is thoroughly engaging as it features a great story, top-tier acting performances, an intriguing theme, as well as probably the best sound design of the year. (Warning: Spoilers Ahead)The flow of the story is constant and feels highly realistic, which kept me thoroughly locked in on the characters and wondering where the plot was headed next. With Riz Ahmed's character at the center of the film, he shows off some top-tier acting while portraying the raw emotions that Ruben is going through, making the audience feel every bit of anger, frustration, and other emotions on this rocky road on the path to acceptance of his hearing loss. The theme of acceptance is where the movie genuinely excelled since it hammers home that being deaf is not a problem at all, it is our thoughts about it, wherein lies the real problem. The driving force of this great message certainly has to be Joe (played by Paul Raci), who is a teacher at the deaf community that Ruben joins. His calm, collected, and soothing persona provides the film with the perfect guide for both Ruben and anyone watching the film on the path to enlightenment. Changing the way that Ruben thinks about his 'problem', was the only solution to finding his inner stillness, and letting go of all the negative emotions he was dealing with.Now, even though there's more than enough reason to watch this movie from the details provided above, what takes the cake as the element which weaves the entire film together, is the exceptional sound design. The sound throughout the film is fused seamlessly with the story elements and emotional landscape of every scene.

Upon the suggestion from Prime Video, I watched Sound of Metal,Yes, winter movie season is in full swing. It seems like there are so many great offerings every weekend on multiple platforms. A plethora of opportunities for entertainment. Upon the suggestion from Prime Video, I watched Sound of Metal, which premiered on the platform on December 4, 2020. Here's why it was such a worthwhile experience.The plot of Sound of Metal is pretty simple - it's a drama starring Riz Amhed as a heavy metal drummer whose life takes an unexpected turn when he begins to lose his hearing. Ahmed plays the drummer, Ruben, who is part of the heavy mental duo with his girlfriend played by Olivia Cooke, and their music career seems to be going along smoothly. But, as a recovering addict, the hearing loss sends Ruben into a tailspin. As directed by Darius Marder, the crux of the film is how Ruben copes with the monumental change in his life and the emotions that he goes through, will he be able to hear again, will his relationship survive, will he survive and so many deep and devastating questions. It's not just a typical movie about an addict - though that is an important part. The film also dives into questions of identity and what makes us who we are - or who we think we are.All of these questions hinge on the strength of the performances of Ahmed, Cooke and Paul Raci. Raci plays a sponsor, or mentor of sorts, to Ruben as he deals with his addiction and his hearing loss. Ahmed plays Ruben so well. There's so much passion, and fear, felt throughout film. The success of the film really rests on Ahmed's shoulders and he carries it well. Cooke is very good as the girlfriend and bandmate. It's understandable why she may be a motivating factor for Ruben. Raci is very impactful in his part too. He's stern, thoughtful and makes a necessary contrast to Ruben. There's a lot of care in each of these performances and they grow as the movie goes along. These characters are really well-rounded and provide a strong foundation for this emotional story.If you are looking for a good, emotional movie to watch, Sound of Metal is a worthy contender. Riz Ahmed's performance is one people will be talking about for the rest of the year. Grab a big box of popcorn and don't miss this movie.",

Riz Ahmed is great, subtle performance which still see his emotion changes through the journey. Paul Paci, who is fantastic in this role, his character is so emotionally connect to Ruben, he wants the best for him but also he has to protect the community.

I'd never thought that I'd say this, but this pretty much remembers me of Memento, since its best point is the achievement of making you empathize with the character, by enabling you to feel what he is feeling (through really different techniques though).
