            "content": "Extraction stars Chris Hemsworth and was produced by the Russo brothers. It was directed by Sam Hargrave in his directorial debut. He has previously made a career as a stuntman, most notably as a stunt coordinator in several Marvel movies. And that definitely shows in the film. This film contains some of the nicest action set pieces seen in years.Unfortunately, this comes at a price. Namely that of an interesting story. While the story of Extraction - a gun for hire (Hemsworth) shooting his way through Bangladesh in order to rescue the kidnapped son of a drug lord - is perfectly serviceable, it's also nothing to write home about. The characters are shallowly written and while they're acted well enough, the main attraction of the film are those action scenes.That being said, those are definitely good enough on their own to justify the price of admission. Hemsworth gives an electrifying performance as a man spread too thin by all the violence he has caused, while Randeep Hooda gives an equally memorable performance as his foil and counterpart.And it's just plain fun to watch. If you have a soft spot for those 80s action films such as Commando or Rambo, then this is definitely worth checking out.",

Battling hostiles and a troubled past along the way.Thank you Jon Wick for upping the game for action films! Extraction excels in its action set pieces. Long, gorgeous takes with brutally grounded fight scenes, showcase the vicious nature of warfare. Hemsworth carries this entire film on his shoulders and has the daunting task of elevating the paper thin narrative to an acceptable level. Thankfully, he succeeds. Thor can act darn it, and in this film he proves it yet again.Like Jon Wick before him, seeing Hemsworth kicking ass in amazingly choreographed fight scenes, is exhilarating. The film is unapologetically honest in its depiction of violence and its consequences. Riding on fantastic sound design, every impact, bullet wound and car crash pulls you in deeper and deeper in the film.",

Let's break away from the monotony of New York, L.A., and Chicago and go international: Mumbai, Tokyo, Lagos.The premise of the movie is simple and it's all in the title. A skilled mercenary named Tyler (Chris Hemsworth) has been contracted to extract a drug dealer's kidnapped son. It's pretty much a suicide mission, but Tyler didn't need even the slightest coaxing to take the job. He didn't even ask the price. Some odd hours later he's in Bangladesh, kid in tow, shooting his way out of a sticky situation.This ballsy grimy film took you through the muck in style. The camera angles and continuous action shots were fresh as it followed Tyler from one point to the next while he shot and fought John Wick style to his extraction point. \"Extraction\" was raw at times, shocking at other times, and even moving at times. It's a no frills visceral form of action that keeps you at the edge of your seat and constantly engaged. Ooooh! give me more.",

It's not a real life documentary, not an ensemble boring drama piece. When it comes to wham-bang entertainment, this movie delivers on all cylinders. The movie is probably more analogous to a version of masterful The Raid than an Oscar drama piece. Live with it. Watch it. Enjoy. It is a movie. It will keep you glued.

            "content": "In a world that is currently minus new films, to get a fresh one delivered to us via Netflix was a much needed treat. And I'm glad to report that 'Extraction' was worth the wait. It isn't a flawless movie, but it certainly has some good things going for it. The action sequences were probably the highlight of the film for me. I'm not usually someone who appreciates or even notices good action sequences, but I did with this film which says something. There is one sequence that really blew me away. It is a one-shot sequence that goes on for quite some time and has some amazing ingenuity behind it. Definitely the highlight of the film.Chris Hemsworth was right at home in this role. He doesn't have to do a lot of speaking, and can just let his actions speak for themselves. Some of the stunt work in this film would not have been easy. When he is required to slow things down and have some dialogue in the odd scene he does so adequately.The film surprised me with just how violent it was willing to be at times, especially in scenes involving children. There were a couple of time where I thought - they're not going to do that are they? - and then sure enough they did. This is a very serious film as well. Very little (if any that I can think of) humour whatsoever makes an appearance.The film does get a little tedious towards the end. You can only watch so many people getting shot without becoming numb and a little bored by it. Also the film opens with a shot from near the end of the film. It doesn't work though because there is no intrigue behind it. This was one of the few poor choices an otherwise very good film made however. I would recommend giving this one a watch.",

Other than that, all the story is already in the title, which is fine for this type of movie. The actor, who played the boy was a wonderful casting choice. He was carrying the whole emotion of story. We'll be seeing more of him. Other characters were not drawn out. This movie is not for everyone, it is not well rounded, it's all action and no story. I personally enjoyed it though. I recommend this for viewers that like close combat action and martial arts movies.",

I'm reading the reviews about no plot... seriously? Just because there's no surprising unpredictable plot twist doesn't mean there's no plot. It was a simple story, adapted into a screenplay from the graphic novel by Ande Parks, and presented on a bullet ridden testosterone plate.

Hemsworth proves his acting chops more so in this, in my opinion, than in Rush (2013), and his ability to carry such a heavy and strenuous role especially in means of training. The fight choreography is stellar, and the long shots during the extensive chase scene were particularly impressive, further immersing the viewer in the tension. Other characters such as the boy were all depicted so realistically and humanly, even the \"bad guy.\" There was really nobody that didn't deliver and that's what made the movie even more engaging. How it was ended, like the last thirty seconds, I also have to applaud.",

For one, Hemsworth's character is named Tyler Rake, and he kills two people with a rake. It's a nice wink by the filmmakers. Another highlight is the extended tracking shot during the movie's strongest and most violent sequence. I'm not sure if it's the best tracking shot ever in an action movie, but it very well may be the longest.If you enjoy action movies, you'll probably enjoy this one. It's perfectly adequate.",

            "content": "The latest Netflix original film to arrive on the streaming service. Extraction sees Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), a black market mercenary, embark on the most deadly extraction of his career when he's enlisted to rescue the kidnapped son (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) of an imprisoned international crime lord.As much as their originals are hit and miss and the sheer amount of content they release being ridiculous, there is no question that Netflix allow pure filmmaker freedom without the restrictions and interference of Hollywood influence as here the film is allowed to make full use of its 18 rating and not have the burden of setting up or continuing a franchise. Though generic and cliche in its story telling, the action and stunt work are an absolute blast to witness and make this a step up from what I was expecting.The film's 2 hour runtime may have some filler sequences around the middle section, but the 1st and 3rd acts are fast paced and frantic, throwing you right into the situation, the film knows exactly what it wants and sets out to deliver it. The race against time and constant improvisation of the extraction itself makes for a consistently engaging watch, though the film does brush over motivations (the villain here is especially lacklustre) and character back story, with Tyler solely relying on a few flashbacks and essentially an exposition interview with the kid he is protecting, so that we get more of his story.However what this basic premise does allow for is to be filled with brutal, well choreographed and creative action. This film delivers one of the best set pieces of this year, with a phenomenal one-take style 15 minute sequence, which goes from a car chase, to a building assault to a lorry chase, it's absolute controlled chaos. As a fan of John Wick, The Raid etc. it was excellent to see their influence on the choreography, the camerawork never is too shaky or quick cutting meaning it is easy to follow and witness every stab, punch, kick in their bone crunching and visceral glory. The shootouts sound great and are intense, always ending in bloody results, especially the finale sequence.It's good seeing Hemsworth in a grittier, darker non-Thor/MIB role and he delivers here in a more somber and focused role, though also channels some of the action hero vibe of the 80/90's that this film is going for. Jaiswal is also good here as the kid thrown into this life or death situation, he is never irritating or acts unrealistically at all (which is the case with kids in these types of films at times). Randeep Hooda has an intimidating screen presence as someone working for the kid's father and David Harbour gives an enthusiastic performance, though his character's section does stall the plot pacing.Extraction is a fun watch to turn your brain off for 2 hours and was actually better than I expected. The action is bloody, visceral and frantic with some brilliant practical effects and choreography and the cast give good performances. The film does suffer from several cliches and genre traits and lack of character depth, but honestly from a purely entertainment perspective this does the job.",

I'm pleased to say that EXTRACTION is their biggest and best one yet, a large budget slice of action spectacle with an excellent setting in Dhaka. The Bangladeshi city is brought to life the same way that Morocco was in the third BOURNE film, with all the bustle and sights and sounds.Chris Hemsworth, always the most charismatic of the AVENGERS, is a great choice for the taciturn lead and he really throws himself into the brawling, bruising action scenes. The story is nothing special, we've seen it done a million times before, but the direction is fresh and vibrant and the action choreography is excellent. The two highlights are the lengthy chase sequence at the mid point, which utilises all kinds of heavy camera work, camera tricks, and stunt doubles to truly convince, and of course the immersive bridge spectacle at the climax. What a delight to see America finally catching up with the likes of China's WOLF WARRIOR 2 in terms of films featuring lavish, wide-scale thrills and spills.",

Unfortunately, they completely missed mark making the set in Dhaka.To start with, the accent of the locals are wrong, they are speaking in an accent that's commonly used in West Bengal, India. Dhaka and People in Bangladesh, in General, have a completely different accent. Throughout the movie, Hindi songs are heard in the background, where everyone is watching tv during midday. People go to work here, Dhaka is the capital, nobody sits on their asses watching TV midday. Bangladesh has its own music industry, although the movie had some issues acquiring copyright for some of the songs to play in the background.The environment is wrong. Sure Dhaka has slums and dirty places, but most of the city is developed enough with an actual nice road system. If they set the scene somewhere else in Bangladesh, it would've been more convincing. The roads are basically dirt roads in this movie where Dhaka has one of the best road systems in the Country. Dhaka doesn't have that kinda dense jungle anywhere near the city, certainly not near the Buriganga river.The criminal class in Bangladesh is completely different. This isn't Africa, people don't employ child soldiers here. And certainly carry Ak-47 in hand and in the open.The Police uniform and looks are completely misjudged. They are trying to portray the elite force of Bangladesh, Known as Rapid Action Battalion. They are not regular police. The deal with counter-terrorism and similar stuff. It should've been the police that deals with criminal or action in the street. Police vehicles are wrong.Don't get me wrong, the entire movie is brilliantly shot and exceptionally action-packed. But this provides a complete misrepresentation of Bangladesh, as well as the city of Dhaka. People who don't have an idea about Bangladesh will get a false sense for a beautiful country by the misrepresented set of this movie.",

My Facebook account is inundated with unwanted advertisements, and I've yet to see one for any mercenary, much less one that lacks courage. Now you likely find this to be worthless meanderings, but that's where the first feature length film from director Sam Hargrave took me. Mr. Hargrave is a veteran stunt coordinator and stunt performer (he's been the stunt double for Chris Evans' Captain America), and he's working from a script by Joe Russo (director and producer of the last two Avengers movies and the last two Captain America movies).Chris Hemsworth (THOR) stars as the aforementioned Tyler Rake. It's a role that would have just as easily worked for Jason Statham or, in past years, Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone, or Arnold Schwarzenegger. Rake is a live action hero, haunted by visions and dreams of better times. His fighting prowess, shooting skills, and willingness to play roulette with his own life, make him the perfect hire for imprisoned drug lords when their son is kidnapped by a rival drug lord. And that's exactly what happens.The film opens with Tyler in a bad spot. He's injured and trying to shoot his way out of a mess where he's badly outnumbered. The film then flashes back a couple of days where we witness the kidnapping of Ovi Jr (Rudrhaksh Jaiswal) by Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli), the drug lord rival to Ovi Jr's imprisoned father. We also see Tyler, after a few too many drinks, take a running leap off a 30 meter cliff into an Australian lake. Soon he's visited by Nik (Golshifteh Farahani, Adam Driver's wife in PATERSON). She acts as his handler for the dangerous jobs, and few are more risky than extracting Ovi Jr.What follows are fast-paced car chases through the dusty streets of Dhaka, bone-crunching hand-to-hand combats, and more shootouts than we've seen in a while. Tyler's job is to extract Ovi Jr and deliver him safely home. When things go sideways, the two end up on the run from an entire army, and take cover in a local sewer ... with all the sights and smells you might imagine. Supporting roles are covered by David Harbour as Tyler's old friend, and Randeep Hooda as Ovi Sr's right-hand man.As you might expect, there are double-crosses and plenty of opportunities for Tyler to show off his 'fearless' mercenary skills. Ovi Jr is a bit of a nerd, but does offer up some life philosophy for his troubled protector: \"You drown not by falling in the water, but by staying submerged in it.\" The kill count here is extraordinarily high and literally thousands of rounds get fired. What's most surprising, however, is that Tyler's cell phone somehow survives his many falls, gunshots, sewage, and car collisions. It's much more impressive than the old Timex commercials. Gifted cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel (X-MEN movies, DRIVE, THREE KINGS, THE USUAL SUSPECTS) does an admirable job capturing the action sequences; it's just that this is too similar to many movies we've seen before, though it serves as a chance for Hemsworth to be something other than Thor. For those in need of an action flick fix after all this social distancing, EXTRACTION should scratch the itch.",

            "review_title": "Extraction is Netflix's best action original of its history!",
            "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)A lot of times, people can't figure out who was really in control of a particular movie. Was the director truly the person in charge of every creative and technical choice? Were the producers the ones responsible for most of the film? Or was the cast that carried the whole thing? Extraction might be Sam Hargrave's directorial debut, but he's been a stunt coordinator in Marvel films, working with the Russo brothers in Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Endgame. The complexity of each choreography screams their names all the way through.Now, I don't want to take any credit from Hargrave! He has a clear vision of how the film should be like, and he delivers the best Netflix original action movie ever. While it's true that this last sentence doesn't really mean that much, it's genuinely great and far better than every other original action flick distributed by the streaming network. Two key components make Extraction a success: its unbelievable, jaw-dropping action, and Chris Hemsworth's extraordinary physical (and emotional) performance.I'll start with the actor. Chris Hemsworth is one of the most underrated actors working today. Everyone looks at his portrayal of Thor in the MCU, and think that he can't do anything else. First of all, Thor is one of the characters that changed the most within that universe. Chris has demonstrated both his dramatic and comedic range interpreting this superhero. However, in Extraction, not only his physical display and stunts are out of this world (he actually does quite a lot of them), but he's able to slow down and really delve into an emotionally compelling state. Brilliant performance!Nevertheless, the action steals the show. Joe and Anthony Russo help Sam Hargrave in bringing their Marvel's experience of having to balance dozens of characters at the same time, and the impressive choreography elevates the film so damn much. During the promotion campaign, people kept talking about a stunning oner (one-take sequence), which Chris Hemsworth himself described as \"the most complicated action sequence\" he's ever done... They were not joking nor overselling their movie. It's genuinely a work of art.I was so surprised by those (approximately) twelve minutes that I stopped the film, went back, and watched them again. I believe it's one of the pros that home viewing has against theaters. Just to be clear, it's not actually just one take. It's a collection of long takes \"stitched\" together to make it seem (and feel) like a oner. However, it doesn't diminish this incredibly technical achievement in any way, much on the contrary! The long takes are packed with all kinds of action: car chases, shootouts, knife fighting, hand combat, running, jumping, crawling, you name it.I'm going to put myself at risk and state that it's one of the best oners of an action flick in the last few years, especially if we don't count the two best action sagas of today (Mission: Impossible, John Wick). Throughout the whole runtime, the action is exceptionally filmed. The editing is impeccable, the excitement is always there, and the sense of urgency is never lost. It rarely gets over-the-top, every time our protagonist gets hit, cut, or even shot, it never feels like he should be down and dead. It's that base of realism inside an action movie that can make it become an outstanding success or a massive fail, and Extraction built a very solid one.This film has all the ingredients of popcorn-entertainment, and I'm confident it will get huge praise from, at least, the general public. However, it's evident that the Russo brothers and Hargrave didn't offer the screenplay the same care that they had with the action. Even though it's a pretty simple premise, the attempts at making secondary characters important or emotionally resonant fail its target completely. Even Tyler Rake gets a pretty cliche backstory that everyone has seen hundreds of times. I struggled to care for a single person or a relationship.The reason behind the whole extraction procedure being due to some drug warlords is so formulaic that it's honestly becoming annoyingly unimaginative. There isn't even a logical reason for them to be fighting each other over one's son. The movie also wraps up by leaving tons of questions unanswered regarding its plot, and with a ridiculous try at either being philosophical or actually ruining the entire thing. Finally, I was never a fan of films starting with a flashforward of the protagonist, especially in this genre. It takes away tension and suspense during the actual movie since the viewer knows the flashforward scene hasn't happened yet.In the end, Extraction is going to be remembered by its insane action and a fantastic lead performance by Chris Hemsworth. The latter is one of the most underrated actors working today, and he delivers not only a phenomenal physical performance but also an emotionally powerful display. The action is jaw-dropping at every level. The outstanding choreography plus the seamless editing are able to elevate the action into some of the best I've seen in the last few years, including a technically mind-blowing oner. The excitement levels are super high throughout the entire runtime, credit not only to the Russo brothers but also to the debutant director Sam Hargrave (who definitely leaves his mark action-wise), who all make a great film. However, the focus went all to the action, making the actual story and characters suffer from formulaic storytelling, cliche backstories, and an overall lack of emotional attachment. Still, Extraction is the best Netflix original action movie of its history, so don't miss it!Rating: B+",

Tyler is former Australian SAS but is haunted by the loss of his own son. Once in Dhaka he manages to retrieve the boy from his captors but getting him safely out of the city won't be easy. His erstwhile kidnapper is determined to get him back and he controls a corrupt police colonel who shuts down the city to hunt for them... if that weren't enough Saju, a former member of Indian special forces working for the boy's father, is determined to take to boy to avoid paying for the rescue.It must be stated the plot is both unlikely and rather simple... that doesn't matter though; it is there to provide a reason for the action and that action is great. From start to finish the action barely lets up... much of what happens from the moment of Rake rescues Ovi feels as if it is set in real time with camera work that puts the viewer right in the middle. Instead of the frequent cuts favoured by some directors we gets scenes that look like a single take. The action includes numerous shootings, chases on foot and in vehicles and a near-obligatory exploding helicopter. Chris Hemsworth really impresses as Tyler Rake as does Randeep Hooda as Saju; the rest of the cast are solid enough too. With its near non-stop violence this certainly won't be for everybody but if you want an action movie and enjoyed films like 'John Wick' and 'The Raid' this is sure to appeal to you.",

If you can manage those kind of scenes you're in for some well shot action scenes. It's mostly about Chris Hemsworth that fits perfectly as the untouchable hero macho warrior. Extraction is just easy popcorn entertainment with a cast that did a pretty good job, with some great action scenes that are well choreographed, and some quality cinematography. They didn't spare any expenses shooting those action scenes, it's all quality. That said don't expect a deep story, it's not there, so if it's that you're looking then for just skip this one.

            "content": "\"Extraction\" is probably one of the best action movies that I've watched until now. There is a huge ammount of realism added in the fight scenes, in the special effects and in the movie atmosphere as well. A special element which makes me think of this movie as a good one is the fact that when the people have been firing on each other, the bullets were almost to hit the target. There are no blind shooters in this movie, who are shooting 100 bullets at around 50 yards of the target. Even if the bullets don't hit the protagonists, they are very close to do so and this creates a very specific realism. What has impressed me so much is the scene when Tyler is fighting with Sajur in the street, who are being watched by the frightened citizens and locals around them. This demonstrates to me that I didn't waste my time with this movie.",

            "content": "\"Extraction\", in terms of writing, is as uninspiring and typical as its name, but that's not the sell here, is it... Directed by the experienced stunt coordinator and fight choreographer Sam Hargrave, \"Extraction\" is an action-packed and eye-pleasing romp of violent action, anchored by excellent stunt work and often impressive camera trickery.\"Extraction\" is yet another addition to the Netflix blockbuster collection, perhaps a notch better than most before, but flawed in all the same ways. The story is based on the graphic novel \"Ciudad\" co-written by Russo brothers, who adapted it into this film script as well. It's a highly derivative plot, mirrors tens if not hundreds of other thrillers, possesses a high predictability factor, and, as a sum, is just narrow and shallow. It tends to be unrealistic, which is no biggie for a blockbuster like this one, but in the second half, specifically the finale sequence on the bridge, it got a little too far fetched. The character of Tyler Rake (cheesy, isn't it) is your usual cardboard American hero in his usual swipe-and-pick-your-action-man story arch. Where \"Extraction\" truly shines is in the action department, which, obviously, takes up most of the screen time. The first half offers many amazing and satisfyingly violent action scenes showcasing impressive choreography and a little insane camera/editing work. Around the middle of the movie we have the talky-talky interlude, after which we get back to action, this time a little weary, as it gets a tad repetitive, and the climax is plagued by some perhaps small unrealistic touches, but a little frustrating nevertheless. The performances are fine and dandy, but almost the entirety of the roles weren't much broader than one dimension. Naturally, such an action-heavy an expensive movie is coated up in good overall aesthetical design, great cinematography and an okay if a little too contemporary original score.\"Extraction\" offers no revolution, not even any tweaks, but it will entertain You with great action sequences, and if You come expecting it to be for what it is, You should not be met with disappointment. My rating: 6/10.",

Extraction is just an average one because three main reasons.First, acting is pretty poor. I do not expect an Oscar winner as a lead actor, but Keanu, Benicio and even Sly, are more credible than Chris. I like Chris but not here. I didn't feel any empathy for him.Second, the script is pretty weak and the ending a joke. Again, I do not expect too much, but there are a bunch of extremely unbelievable situations and decisions by the characters that makes this movie sometimes awkward.Last, the use of CGI here is not bad but some explosions looked cheap and the scene jumping from the waterfall and then doing underwater meditation was embarrasing.\nThere are many examples of good action movies with a low budget but pretty real, raw and brutal. Check action scenes on Rambo 4 to see what I am talking about.\nSo, overall an average action film to watch during the lockdown. Forgettable after it.",

As they get shot at by goons with terrible aim, C.H. has to face the ethical consideration that, while he's extracting the kid from a bunch of criminals, the guy who he's bringing it back to is *also* a criminal.

The acting, dialogue, and action were all impressive. Focusing on the action scenes in particular, they included exciting hand-to-hand combat and firearm sequences. Hemsworth pulled it off well.

NOPE! That's because they are hypocrites! They call this movie a 'white savior' movie, simply because they want you to click on their website, that's all it is!Anyway, this movie has lots of plot holes: There were 2 opportunities where the main character could have killed his pursuer yet he didn't... this is sloppy writing and adds 2 plot holes. Considering how much trouble this pursuer gives the main character later on in the story, this writing choice was a conscious choice by the writers and they simply chose to ignore the massive plot hole that they created (twice).Also, the main character on more than one occasion chooses to not pick up a superior gun, and instead just runs around with his standard handgun... this is another plot hole and sloppy writing. I also counted at least 4 scenes where combatants engaged each other in hand-to-hand combat, despite there being a large abundance of weapons in the immediate vicinity... this is obviously done to create a false sense of drama and suspenseAnother plot hole is that in one scene the main character gets hit by a car that's going about 40kph... this is impossible seeing as the entire street was full of cars and people at that time... and then not even 1minute later, the main character hits another guy with a truck, yet as I stated previously, THE ENTIRE STREET was blocked with cars and people... so it's literally impossible for the truck to have been driven down the street, as it was blocked. That's another 2 plot holes right there.Overall, if you look past the glaring plot holes and sloppy writing, then the movie is watchable... I'd give it a 6/10... it's not NEARLY as good as Equalizer or John Wick or Taken, but if you've already watched all those movies, then I guess this movie would be OK to watch... I don't think the director (Sam Hargrave) did a particularly amazing job or a particularly poor job in his directorial debut either... we will just have to see if his next film will be any better",

What caught my attention was the trailer of Extraction, that finally gave me hope to wait for a big action blockbuster. And having watched it on Netflix just minutes ago, I can assure you that it's the best action movie of the year till now. The film lived up to the hype and left me satisfied as the credits rolled.Extraction's USP is the action it offers: beautifully shot, neatly choreographed and well-edited too. Those fed up of quick cuts in recent action movies would be pleasantly surprised to find long takes in this film (in this case, a prolonged single-shot action sequence!) instead of fast cutting. The color tone is rich and suits the film's own tone. There are a couple of dramatic breaks between the action that make the viewers root for the characters.Chris Hemsworth delivers an impressive performance that gels with his character, while Rudraksh Jaiswal also presents us with a neat act. It's finally very satisfying to see Randeep Hooda doing a character like this. Make no mistake, he's done a couple of action films before but never did he play a tough character like this: one that allows him to both throw a punch and emote whenever needed.Extraction is also surprisingly realistic in terms of how it doesn't want to turn heroes into indestructible characters. When they get hit, they bleed. When they are injured, they feel pain. And given how all of this is done masterfully during its video-game style action, Extraction fulfills the action genre to its fullest. Again, since there's no way one's gonna step out and pay to buy tickets and popcorn to a movie at this moment, it's better to stay home, grab some snacks and prepare yourself for a thrill-a-minute, no-nonsense action ride called Extraction. Action aficionados are definitely in for a massive treat.",

I think if the director would have approached an actor from Bangla Film Industry like Jishu Sengupta it would have been a splendid thing to watch.

It's during this sequence that the sheer impressiveness of the filmmaking - the complex camerawork, the tight choreography, the painful stunts - begins to outweigh the piece's narrative shortcomings. Unfortunately, those shortcomings really are quite significant and they start to seep back into the fray once the film inevitably cuts away from its magnum opus. Really, the story is about as bare-bones as you can get, with its generic characters and often-seen situations serving only to get it from set-piece to set-piece. To start with, the flick is actually rather dull. Even the first action sequence doesn't feel impactful because you don't care about anyone involved with it. After a certain point, though, the thing becomes a lot more engaging. It starts to seep some actual character from the gaps in its violence and, even if this is still basic stuff, it helps carry you through to the end of the slightly-too-long plot. The movie takes itself pretty seriously but it's still firmly in the realm of 'turn your brain off' fun. It's rather exciting when it gets going and, ultimately, it is enjoyable. It's lucky that the action is as genuinely good as it is, because it's the only thing that will keep you watching. 6/10",

He uses guns, objects, or knives in any fight he can get into. Chris Hemsworth plays a mercenary, who is assigned to rescue a drug lords son in Dhaka. While the kidnappers who puts a huge bounty on the sons life which has the corrupt police, military, and other henchmen all after the son and Chris Hemsworth. The film is action packed. The director can manage the action sequences. It is brutal. And there is one long take with the action scene that was impressive. The character Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) who is the drug lord son. I will say the weakest thing about the movie is Rudhraksh Jaiswal performance. It was hard to understand his dialogue with all the mumbling every time he spoke.Otherwise, Extraction is a good action film. Chris Hemsworth is great.

Sometimes people just need a release and watch some simple good action and this is it.Linking to what I just said, the plot. So, it doesn't go into any kind of depth into the villain whatsoever, it was just this is who he is, deal with it. Why did he have all this power? He just needed depth. He was also barely in it. Like I said before it didn't bother me at all, but I can see why that would fuss a lot of others.

The high point in the film for me was when Hemsworth speaks in Bangla asking for evidence, \"Promaan Dao\" (show me the evidence, for those who didn't know), not once but thrice stunning the original captors and the dumb struck audience - I am almost certain that the looks on our faces would have mirrored those he was addressing on screen. Well, after a couple of hours of mayhem Ovi is indeed rescued but not before almost everyone dies. The film gets full marks for the fight fest and zero for anyone's acting - actually no one needed to act. Shataf Figar makes his presence felt inadequate small role of a sniper in Dhaka.",

The plot looked to me as though it was 1960 or something like that. They couldn't have made Dhaka look dirtier. Needless to mention how ridiculous Bangla accent was. I couldn't even differentiate whether the actors were speaking Bangla or Hindi because their accent was pretty much same.",

At this time, the only saviour is digital platforms like Netflix which aired its one\nof the most anticipated film, Extraction, at least during this lock down period. I just completed watching Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Hooda\nstarrer and felt a real action flick has arrived that will pump up your adrenaline especially on Friday evening.Extraction tells the story of Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) who is a dreaded mercenary and supposed to rescue the son of warlord in Mumbai\nfrom clutches of his competitor in Bangladesh. The rescue operation goes haywire when he is interrupted by unknown intruders.From the Avengers directors Russo brothers - Anthony and Joe Russo (who also wrote the Graphic novel \"Ciudad\", on which film is based),\nExtraction is directed by Sam Hargrave who has done the stunts in some 80 films, including the Marvel super heroes flicks like Avengers : Endgame\nand Avengers : Infinity WarThe movie starts with a bang as Tyler Rake goes all the possible way the moment rescue operations initiates. Tyler he faces the goons where he fights with knives and guns which is brilliantly choreographed followed by an eye-popping car chase scene as Tyler drives through the busy streets of Dhaka.\nI would like to highlight that this probably one of the best car chase scenes which an outstanding camera work. The street-fight between Randeep Hooda is another spectacular treat to watch out as both actors does well in the hand combat.If you think this is enough, hold on as there is a high-octane climax scene with jaw-dropping stunts. The movie traverses through a wafer-thin plot and yet\nmanages to keep you on the edge of seat with some of best stunts. Screenplay does falter in few places but I will not complain as Extraction kept me glued to the screen for 1 hour 56 mins.This is a movie for those people who love action films and should be respected as each and every choreography is worth clapping. The movie goes very\nwell with electrifying background score. Art direction is superb while Cinematography is wonderful, especially during the action scenes.\nWriting by Joe Russo is engaging and does not let blink your eye for a minute.Tyler Rake could only be played by one and the only Chris Hemsworth. The actor not only emotes well with his expression but is\nfantabulous with his hand combat and action stunts. I loved Randeep Hooda as he brings in spark once he enters the scenes. Rudhraksh Jaiswal\nand Golshifteh Farahani were good in their part while Pankaj Tripathi has one just scene in the film.Overall, if you are in need for some kick-ass action film, Extraction is the right dose for you.

Extraction is another example of this as the Russo Brothers hired their Avengers stunt coordinator for this project. It's lacking the sleekness of John Wick, but goes in a different direction with a raw, gritty approach to action and a real Call of Duty vibe. Chris Hemsworth is great and this is easily one of his best performances outside of Thor. The story is pretty by-the-numbers, but Extraction's incredible action makes this a worthwhile watch.",

            "content": "Extraction\n18\n2020\nDirector: Sam Hargrave\nStarring: Chris Hemsworth, David Harbour, Rudhraksh Jaiswal, Randeep Hooda, Pankaj Tripathi etc\nOverall rating 92/100Extraction is based on a black-market Mercenary called Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) who must go on his riskiest extraction yet where he has to save a young boy from two feuding gangs. I thought Extraction was excellent and there is so many good things to talk about so let's get started.First of all, the cinematography/visual creativity and set pieces were fantastic. Having the film set in India was a really interesting choice for an action movie and for me it really worked. The cramped streets were perfect for action sequences and the temples being beautiful to look at which is something that directors of action don't usually do. The film's cinematography and visual creativity was fantastic as well, the rich colours of yellow and orange were fantastic and the camera work was also excellent with the camera following the characters through some of the scenes and in the car chase scenes which created a great effect making you feel like you are in the movie with them.My next positives would be the film's tense tone, gore, and incredible action. The film managed to execute an excellent tense tone throughout, with the film managing to even make you jump on multiple occasions due to it's deliberate lack of sound making you on the edge of your seat for a large portion of the movie. The film's gore and action for me was some of the best parts of the movie. Due to the film's constant nonstop action you were consistently entertained throughout and never bored, the variety of different action scenes and the creativity within them were as good as John Wick without a doubt. And the excessive use of gore was fantastic as well and added to the impact of the action scenes with even me having to look away on a couple of occasions.My Only two nit-picks with the movie for me would be the lack of character background and the slight lack of depth to the plot. The film just went straight into the action in the beginning without any background information on the main character which I always find slightly annoying, we learned more as the movie went on, but it's always nice if you feel partly connected to the character before the action kicks in. And the movie did suffer from a slight lack of depth to it's plot, this is largely because the movie largely went for style over substance which fortunately for the movie is fine and perfectly acceptable, but it was very much one objective throughout leading to an end you were largely expecting so it would have been nice if they added a few more layers to the movie.My next two positives would be the character depth and the director not being afraid to cross near the line with child gang members. The movie went into a surprising amount of character depth with Chris Hemsworth's character that I wasn't expecting. His whole background of losing his son at a young age was truly heart-breaking, but it also made you understand his character more by how much he was willing to sacrifice in order to save the child that he became connected to, so this was well done. The director also was not afraid to cross near the line with use of kids in gangs. It was shocking to me how many of the kids were in the street gangs, but it also portrayed a more realistic portrayal of what gang culture looks like which I found interesting. The fact that the film was so willing to kill off the children was also shocking but made you dislike the antagonists more therefore doing a successful job.My final two positives would be the film's excellent performances and emotional weight. Chris Hemsworth was excellent in Extraction. He pulled of all the action sequences excellently which as an audience was well aware due to the marvel cinematic universe. But he really got his moment to shine here, but he also showed versatility with his acting as well with his characters more sensitive side. The debut performance (at least for me) of Rudhraksh Jaiswal was exceptionally good as well considering he is a much younger actor. The movie also had a surprising amount of emotional weight which I was not expecting as well, When Tyler opened up about losing his son it got to me emotionally which was a welcome surprise, and the fact that he saw his son in the kid really showed after he sacrificed himself to save him which I thought was powerfully executed, also with a clever link back to the beginning with the underwater scene with the kid at the end becoming like Tyler.Overall despite perhaps not having as deep of a plot as it could have had. Extraction is an excellent movie, with excellent creativity with its action and visuals, excellent performances and the blending of action and large amounts of emotion which is rarely used and was executed excellently proving that Chris Hemsworth definitely has an acting life outside marvel.",

            "content": "Extraction is an action thriller film based on the graphic novel \"Ciudad\" by Ande Parks. Starring Chris Hemsworth in the lead role and directed by stunt coordinator Sam Hargrave, it is a generic kidnap and rescue story kept involving by its well shot action scenes and consistent performance by its main star.In Mumbai, India, Ovi Mahajan Jr (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the son of a notorious Indian drug lord, is kidnapped and held to ransom by a group of gangsters working for Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli), Bangladesh's most ruthless drug kingpin, and brought to the capital city of Dhaka. As Ovi's father is currently in prison, he is unable to properly pay the ransom and time is running out over whether or not Ovi will be brought home in one piece. To ensure Ovi's safe return, former soldier and black market mercenary Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) is recruited to travel to Dhaka to extract Ovi from his kidnappers and navigate through the dangerous city with Amir's gang and corrupt police officers hot on their tails.While this genre isn't anything new, Extraction still proves that with the right amount of creative action and star power, there is still some entertainment value to be had. The story follows the typical plot line of an important individual being kidnapped and a tough macho protagonist attempting to rescue said individual. Cliched and silly? Yes, but if that's what you enjoy, then this is for you. The strong violence and gore will certainly be off-putting to casual audiences, but for the most part I think it looked stylised in the vein of the graphic novel from which it was based. With that said, some of it did feel excessive at times and served little purpose other than for sensationalistic action scenes involving the two main characters. In terms of the screenplay, some it felt confusing near the beginning as it didn't do that good of a job establishing the differences between the Indian and Bangladeshi characters to the viewer. We are shown that there is something of a rivalry amidst the two countries involving their drug empires but it isn't really communicated that clearly how severe it is over the course of the film. Also, we see how some of the police forces in each country are in cahoots with the drug lords as they have been bribed to work in their favour but they only really show up in one or two scenes and aren't ever mentioned again. This felt like a missed opportunity to offer a commentary on police corruption but instead it was brushed aside for some more action.Stunt coordinator Sam Hargrave, making his directorial debut, showcases his talents for cleverly choreographed fight scenes and single take shots that keep the viewer on edge. There were parts where I was reminded of some the action-packed moments depicted in the John Wick films, in that the lead character made good use of the surrounding environment to take out his adversaries, even using simple everyday objects as weapons. He also shows how claustrophobic the densely populated cities of India and Bangladesh can be when trying to maneuver through the large number of people to get to where one is going, especially if you're being pursued by dangerous gang members. I still think he has a long way to go before he can be taken seriously as a storyteller, but he has certainly nailed the action and cinematography side of things.Chris Hemsworth plays his usual badass action hero self, shooting, stabbing and punching his way through a seemingly endless number of foes. At this point, it's pretty much confirmed that this is the only type of role he is capable of playing but still, if it ain't broke. I particularly liked his scenes with the young Ovi Jr and how he becomes something of a father figure to him throughout the course of film. There is a nice back and forth dynamic between the two, clearly reflecting on Hemsworth's personal love of India and its people. Unfortunately his interactions with the rest of the cast felt lacking, save for a scene or two with David Harbour, who plays an old army acquaintance of his. These were the only parts of the film that offer some kind of emotional connection with the audience, as the rest is merely bullets flying and things being blown up.As I mentioned earlier, this film offers nothing new from the kidnap and rescue genre but a great deal of its appeal comes from the action rather than the story. Reportedly, there is a sequel in development and although I don't really see this whole thing becoming a franchise, I think it does provide an opportunity for further world building and the ironing out of some this film's issues. If you have nothing better to watch on Netflix, then there's not much else to say but sit back and enjoy this for what it is.I rate it 6.5/10",

            "content": "With new movies few and far between at the moment we have to take them when we get them and there is a new film from Netflix starring Chris Hemsworth called Extraction and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees a special agent sent into Bangledesh to rescue a gangsters son from his rival.Main Character\nAs mentioned above Chris Hemsworth is the main character in this film and he does a really good job. He is great in the action scenes, he is believable and is probably only second to John Wick in terms of his action skills, it is just really entertaining to see him go through multiple enemies and kill them in pretty gruesome ways. His character takes some time to be developed but he has enough depth to him to make you care and you do understand his motivations towards the end of the film.Supporting Characters\nDavid Harbour is probably the most recognisable supporting actor and he does a good job with the limited screen time he has, I bought into his character and Hemsworth's having a relationship and it worked. There is also a character called Saju who is hunting Hemsworth and he is like a Terminator in the action scenes taking down everybody in his path and he has a bit of character depth aswell. Unfortunatley though I didn't care about the boy as much as you are clearly meant to and I thought the villain of the film was incredibly basic and really had nothing interesting about him.Story\nThe best parts of the story are some of the arcs that the characters have, they develop nicely and you understand their motivations, I also thought the ending of the film was well done and left you guessing as to what could come next. Though as you can probably tell from the premise this film has a very basic plot and one that you have seen plenty of times and it does very little to make you think you have seen anything new.Script\nThe script has some heartful moments to it and some well done dramatic moments but it doesn't have anything that reall stands out to it. Plus a film like this doesn't really have any humour which may have been better at times to help humanise Hemsworth and other characters.Style\nThe style of the film is awesome, the action scenes are pretty incredible. They are really well filmed and well choreographed, every hit feels brutal and seeing the inventive ways that people are killed is a joy to see. As mentioned it can be a bit gruesome but I thought it worked for the film an allowed them to be more creative, also it was nice to see Bangledesh used as the backdrop as it provided some unique action sequences.Overall\nOverall, this is a good action film, if you want to see Hemsworth take out tonnes of guys then this is a film for you, it doesn't do anything to stand out too much but is an enjoyable film for sure.Rating - 7/10.",

            "content": "\"Extraction\" is a well made movie and a perfect one to watch at summer. Another great action movie produced by Netflix that people should watch this summer and have fun. This movie draws a lot of inspiration from other movies like: The Bodyguard, Mile 22, 3:10 to yuma and etc. All these movies have the same features: the relationship between two very different characters and delivering a \"package\". Extraction has the same features as well, only it is done in a perfect way and without flaws. The relationship between Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) and the target Ovi is intense and draws the attention, most of their scenes together are good and create the sort of drama this film has. One of the most memorable sequences of the film is the 11 minute action sequence throughout the movie that looks like it's a one - shot. No cuts but just a full one shot sequence that is perfection with a lot of camera movements and scenery. I think I might watch the movie again just for that sequence. Chris Hemsworth is good as always, not only as a professional assassin but also in giving a real acting performance. I highly recommend for those who love action and there is plenty so enjoy.",

It's an engaging action movie with some fine long shots and enjoyable action sequences\nWhat did not work:\nEven if the movie ended with showing the lead actor( not wanting to spoil the movie) visually, it would have worked as well. One thing that is not bad for the eyes but less convincing is the idea of one man army destroying the army effortlessly. It's one of those movies\nFinal verdict: recommended",

Chris Hemsworth has acted well, the stunts are realistic and Randeep Hooda deserves a mention too.\nWatch the movie if you are a sucker for action movies, this one is one of the best action movies with latest techniques lately.

There is one in particular, a 10 minute long, one - shot sequence that should make watching this worth your while.The story is as long as it's IMDb summary. There is nothing more to it. It is meant to appeal to the lowest common denominator and that it does in almost every frame.Hemsworth doesn't have much to do, in the acting department. He has to sling a machine gun or draw a knife and kill/maim every living being, be it a boy or a man, that he comes across.\nRandeep Hooda gets a surprisingly long bit and does as good as he can.There would be detractors who would cry about the lack of aesthetics and a deep storyline, about big wasteful budget.

The film does deliver some pretty good action sequences. They are filmed really well without the over use of shaky can and quick cuts. The choreography is very good. There is a really great 11 minute sequence which is done in \"one take\" and it works marvelously well.I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's around 102 minutes long (excluding the credits) and there is very little downtime. That's because of great actors and a decent script. Chris Hemsworth is great here.

Extraction is everything you've been looking for in terms of action. It may be predictable but it seriously delivers.",

I love Chris Hemsworth as Thor in the MCU is I was interested in seeing how he could do outside of the MCU.Now this movie is actually pretty good I didn't have high expectations as Netflix doesn't have the best track record for their original movies but this one actually surprised me and I really enjoyed it. The best part of this movie is the acting and I thought Chris Hemsworth gave a great performance and really goes deep in the role he is playing. Chris Hemsworth and the kid in the film have some good chemistry in this film. Now the action was mostly good it wasn't perfect that being said. The one thing I didn't like was the villain as he didn't have great motivations.Overall I'm going to give Extraction a 8/10.",

The kidnapped boy acts as a surrogate son whom he creates bonds. The plot seems to be a bit lame because one of the protagonists wants to stiff the bill by killing the people he hired in the first place. The movie is quite realistic in the fighting scenes and the abject poverty of the two countries. Of course what made this movie laughable was the impossible death count that seemed like something out of a computer game. Also the movie relies too much on the star power of Chris Hemsworth. The movie is only watchable because of a few good actors and the action scenes.",

The producer of the movie has done really great job in the way of how its filmed, especially in the car chasing scene. The actor, especially criss, and randeep have been actualized their characters in a very best way.

There is a backstory to Chris' character so that he isn't just \"generic action man\", and it's OK, although it did feel to me like they just put that in for the sake of him having a backstory.The first act is the strongest in my opinion, we get to know some of the characters and we see a good amount of action while the plot progresses. It's simple and to the point: Chris Hemsworth and his team have to extract this kid from the hands of kidnappers that work for a drug lord. I think the movie does get weaker towards the second act though, as it slows down a bit too much for my taste, and the third act is also a bit too long because a) people are getting shot all over the place and there doesn't seem to be much plot development and b) the movie opens with what happens here on the bridge, so there's no intrigue behind what's going to happen.Anyway, Extraction is a good action movie and although I will probably never feel the urge to ever watch it again, I enjoyed it for the most part.",

The movie was not overly complicated like a Bourne film nor was it nearly as good but some of the chemistry between characters and the cat and mouse aspects and a couple of twists really engage the audience.

Honestly, this is what it means to make a truly International Film.The things that work for the film -1) The diverse cast and crew - only a dull person would not appreciate such diversity!2) The Action - The fact that Sam Hargrave was on the Director's Chair I expected nothing short of brilliant action sequences. After all he is the Brain behind the action stunts Of many Action/ Superhero Films.3) The background score - It's edgy, it keeps you active and engrossed in the film.4) The story - it's engaging, I like the character development. Of course there are things that could be improved on but I'm in no mood to complain today. So I'm just going to appreciate.I really enjoyed the chemistry of Chris Hemsworth and the young Rudraksh Jaiswal. A job well done there!5) Location - This film proves that you don't need the Swiss Alps and Dubai skyscrapers to make a good film. The premise is focused and it's good to see that the makers didn't compromise on it by trying to make things look pretty.Also, I am so happy for Randeep Hooda, I read in an old interview of his (think it was in 2013) that he went to university in Australia to pursue a career in Acting in Hollywood but things fell apart. And here comes Extraction - with an Actor from Australia and a Hollywood based project! How perfect to see someone being able to accomplish their dreams. ( I hope his mentor Naseeruddin Shah is really proud of him too).I'd give this film a 9/10 because well there is room for improvement and I'm also feeling really good about seeing a thoroughly engaging action film, that isn't a super hero movie.",

This movie wasn't a documentary, its fiction.

That accent they used, as a Bangladeshi even I can't recognize where they came from. in every house, some Hindi song is playing.\nit's ok if someone wants to make an international movie but I think they could just cut out Bangladesh from this because there is nothing \"Bangladeshi thing\" in it. its all about India and India pretending to be Bangladeshi. its a shame for an independent nation.",

            "content": "Chris Hemsworth has proved he's now one of the best leads in Hollywood, we know he's fantastic as Thor from the Marvel universe but here he's taken on the type of brutal, gritty fast paced action hero lead role that Jason Statham or Liam Neeson might've done!!!\nHemsworth is excellent here & gives a fantastic tough as hell performance as troubled mercenary Tyler Rake & he's one extremely deadly & well trained Black market mercenary with a nothing to lose attitude & a fearless warrior instinct, a great character. Tyler has been hired to find & rescued a kidnapped boy who is held for ransom but the kid is the son of a crime lord. This is set in the dangerous & violent underworld city of Bangladesh & the action is bone crunching, frantic, gritty & full of realism. The town is locked down & full of gangs out hunting for Tyler & the boy (a good performance by Rudhrakish Jaiswal) & these two are ferociously hunted by not just the criminals of the ghettos but also by a deadly Assassin played by Randeep Hooda, a fantastic performance & one hell of a great character who is just as good as Chris Hemsworth here!!!I loved the scary & dangerous atmosphere & the frantic explosive action that bursts out of nowhere & makes everything feel on edge & intense. An exciting survival Thriller that feels real & intense as hell. A wild thrilling ride with great performances & gory blood soaked action.",

So imagine if they knew thor was here back in 2018 they'd be crazy.Love the action scenes also the talented cast like randeep hooda and pankaj tripathi. Amazing performance from others as well except the villain was too lazy and young to portray a powerful drug lord of this country. Plot wasn't much but awesome action sequence.",

Because obviously it was shown to let us wonder his situation. In the end it was all for nothing. (After killing dozens of people why would I care about this one)Honestly it was really difficult to finish watching. Only upside was the filming / cgi technique at car chasing scene but it doesn't save the rest.",

I liked it because of its plot which was very interesting, it had plenty of action and much of suspense. The interpretation of Chris Hemsworth who played as Tyler Rake was very good and he showed us why it was the right choice for this movie. Some other good interpretations that have to be mentioned were Rudhraksh Jaiswal's who played as Ovi Mahajan and Golshifteh Farahani's who played as Nik Khan.

Some the camera work is unique and better than I have ever seen in a realistic fight sequence. You will feel like you a right there in the action. Some of the shots are one take, and clearly took incredible coordination to pull off.. Hemsworth has shown himself be a superb, top tier action star, and I foresee him in many more to come. He has the emotional and physical acting chops to make every scene believable, and his character is both complex and relatable.This film is also much more realistic in its gun use, characters actually reload repeatedly, check weapons for bullets, and constantly use cover accurately. Enemies actually take multiple hits and shots to go down, they don't just take one kick to the chest and die like in the majority of other action films.The plot overall could have some improvements, but it does not take away much from the film. The primary villain needed some more motivating factors, but the film will make you hate him enough to root for anyone who stands against him.I've seen the vast majority of negative reviews are solely based on the fact that the negative aspects of life in Dhaka might be slightly over emphasized, but doing research on my own, it is not significantly different than reality. So I would recommend disregarding the majority of negative reviews and give this film a watch if you enjoy action films. I guarantee you will be amazed by the action sequences and come away impressed with the film.",

Hahaha, this may be a common problem for actors to fix their roles. It's like I'm used to watching wolf uncle's singing and dancing plays. I think wolf uncle's paw can't be drawn to an actress. Mr. tonestak is even more deeply rooted. Apart from Sherlock Holmes, any movie he sees is full of the feeling that he is pretending that he will come back with a click of his watch. In fact, this feeling has a great impact on the experience of watching movies. What do you think about Harry Potter when you watch the escape from Billy toria the other day? Where's the magic wand? Say the mantra. It's too far away from the topic. Continue to talk about this amazing rescue. First of all, the actors are very good. Other actors don't pay much attention to it, because brother hammer is enough. He is handsome enough. The action scene is also very exciting. The same halo of the protagonist is also very obvious. Although he died in the end, in fact, several rockets sealed the bridge and finished. Why bother? But since it's the fans who are basically fluent in the plot, it's fair to say that they can justify themselves. The editing is reasonable and not controversial. The only problem is the setting of the young man. It's a bit like Taiwan's master of success, the chicken soup is too full to swallow.",

            "content": "There are some amazing action scenes in this film - to a certain extent it feels like one long fight scene. There were some continuous shots that were mind blowing - no cutaways or edits, just one long action scene! One of them is 11 minutes long! Unlike lots of action films I found myself literally sitting on the edge of the couch. The acting of the main character - the boy (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) who played Ovi- so impressive! It was completely believable that he was experiencing every emotion from the very beginning of the film to the end. As for the complaints by some reviewers about the locale, music, etc. I am not going to base my impression of a country on what I see in an action movie! Besides - all you have to do is look up the filming locations to see where it was filmed which - by the way - DOES include Dhaka! It is like any other film - locations are selected in order to suit the narrative and the ambience of the story. Would it have played as well in a more up-scale neighborhood? Doubtful - they needed to have the mobility in and out of apartments to move the action forward which would not have worked in another neighborhood. And again - FILM. NOT REAL LIFE.Last thoughts before spoilers - This is not for someone who has a problem with violence in film. But if you are a fan of action films with lots of fighting, you should enjoy it!*****SPOILERS*****\nMy one complaint - the very last scene when Ovi is coming up from the bottom of the pool and you see someone standing there. They are blurry, there is no hint of who it is. Is it the kid who cut off one of his fingers there to get him? Is it one of extraction team? It just leaves you hanging which I find annoying. Actually, that whole scene at the pool seemed out of step - after everything that happened Ovi is just wandering alone at what appears to be a public pool? It almost feels like they couldn't decide how to wrap up the film. That said, these are fairly petty complaints and they do not take away from the film.",

In addition to the fight choreography and action sequences being riveting and gripping, the stunt-work and physical performance by Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Hooda is the highlight of this film - who manage to convince the audiences of them being skilled and trained military men.The films opens on its strength of great action and close combat sequence, hooking me within the first act itself without spending too much time in the exposition. However, the midpoint slows down in pace, in an attempt to build on the relationship between Tyler Rake and the kid he has rescued. The relationship doesn't come across as genuine - but rather a sentimentality that seems falsified, contrived for narrative purpose, which makes this portion all the more boring.The weakest aspect of this film are its subplots. Particularly, the plot-line with David Harbor's character ends up being inconsequential, without revealing anything important about the character or his past with Tyler. Another plot-line - about the kid's father being a drug lord - establishes an arc of their relationship that ends up abandoned and unresolved. Overall, the story of Extraction feels incomplete, with its resolution rushed for the sake of finishing the plot - which makes the screenplay of this film weak and forgettable.\"Extraction\" makes for a good casual watch, with exciting action but an unremarkable story that you probably won't remember in the coming weeks.",

            "content": "First, you have to talk about the action. It's just fantastic. I've seen comparisons to John Wick because both movies were directed by former stunt coordinators and have a distinct style. John Wick is a little bit smoother, polished and stylized. This one is more brutal and visceral. Both are shot excellently and choreographed wonderfully. This one has more brutal intensity with the way it plays out. There's also a lot of variety in the action. There are close corridor shootouts, big open city setting shootouts, car chases, hand-to-hand fights, knife fights, sniping type action, RPG's, one take shot action... Because of the way that it's filmed with the long takes, there's an about 30 minutes long section that basiclly plays in real time. You just feel you are right there in the movie.The other thing the movie does really well is handeling it's story.The basic plot is very straight-forward. A mercenary is trying to get a boy out of the town alive. His objective is very clear from beginning to end. However, it adds complexity, nuance and intrigue with the different characters involved and their relationships with each other.The movie does have sraight-forward and uninteresting villians that are just evil, but it also has characters that are allies to the main the mercenary, but antagonistic to the boy and allies to the boy, but antagonistic to the mercenary. There are a lot of interesting character dynamics that add tension to the action sequences. The plot is straight-forward, but it's executed with intrigue because of the characters and their dynamics.The movie has more emotion than you would expect from a fim like this. There are not any big character arcs, but you learn enough about each of the characters to care about them and their relationships. We also dive a little bit more into the side characters than you'd expect. Even some of the henchmen and assassins are given more depht. There are scenarios of why they are doing what they are doing so you care when you see them in action. Some of them you don't want to die and some of them you do.Chris Hemsworth was great in this movie. We know that he can handle action and be a leading man. This movie ups the stakes of being the here because he's doing real stuntwork. There's no green screen. You see him actually doing fight coreography. When it pauses for the character moments, he gets to really act as this broken man on a mission that's starting to see the humanity in the events. He doesn't rely on his humour or his bag of tricks to make him likeabe. It's al just about the performance and I really think he was the right man for this film.This is not a movie for everyone. This is a hard R action movie. There is violence against children that can be pretty gut-wrenching if that's not your thing. If you're looking for a deep character study or a plot driven movie this isn't that. It's an action movie for people that love that visceral expirience of watching an R-rated action movie. I love that this film got brutal and heart-wrenching. It feels like a gut-punch. Some people won't like it.The thing that holds the movie back the most is the bond that forms between Chris Hemsworth and the boy. It feels sudden. It feels ike from one converstaion to the next there's a big gap that isn't fully earned to hep us understand that transition. It needed a bit more dialogue to build that bridge from one place to the next.This is exactly the kind of movie I want Netflix to make more of. There is talent in front of and behind the camera and they took a risk on a new first time featured director. Since we're in lockdown, I think people a re going to very much enjoy this movie.9/10",

And was glad to see him in Extraction.\nNow First about the cons of this movie, it defies logic and not sure about the body count though. The major negative is wafer thin story and script. The lead antagonist is completely miscast.\nThe major USP of this movie is the '11 Minute' fight sequence. It's one of the best action choreography I've seen in recent past. It was wild, raw, realistic and quite intense. Thanks to Netflix release, the censor less leverage is rightfully used. Not to mention about the cinematography especially in the stunt sequence, kudos to the legend Newton Thomas for his live cinematography.\nFinally our very own Thor, we see him here as Tyler Rake. Chris's portrayal of Tyler rake was great. And it was indeed fresh to see him as such.\nThis movie would sure cater for adrenaline pumping movie lovers!! Grab a bucket of popcorn for a Saturday night movie!!!",

In the end, this movie is as realistic as any superhero movie (and less than many of them, even).Having said that, the action is superb. While the characters aren't more than avatars and the story as thin as possible (rescuing X, in the hands of X in the City X), the chase sequences and shootouts are insane. Some are \"one take\" long shots. Not in the ridiculously boring 1917 way, with minutes and minutes of nothing BUT IN ONE SHOT.

Don't forget the fight during the extraction! Especially the scenes in the apartment block where the camera follows a cop entering the compound during the pursuit. At one point it's too much! Agreed. But it's too much finely executed. It could've been better storywise. Yes of course, especially the ending. All that being said I can't wait for his next film. With all the bad movies shot these days I just hope Hollywood realizes this guy is a gem. Get him a great script and let him roll. He'll be fine.

The first 50 minutes is a rollercoaster ride. A few emotional scenes in between and picks up pace again and ends on a intriguing note. The woman playing the mercenary looks so rugged. The boy who plays the role of gangster's son seriously needs some acting classes, needs to hone some acting skills.\nThe movie is definitely worth a watch.",

The way Chirs Hemsworth portrayed his emotions, and a huge round of applause to Rudhraksh Jaiswal and Randeep Hooda the way they blended so naturally into every scene just made it a great masterpiece. This movie set a new benchmark of you can captivate the audience completely, congratulations Sam Hargrave, instead of naming a school after you in the movie, you should actually open one to teach the upcoming generation about this master class direction. Also Chirs is gonna collect a huge pay check as a producer this one's gonna be huge success.",

Unlike most Netflix movies, this one tops on Production, Casting, Direction and even the story (though many would disagree).THE ACTION:\nThe action scenes are to look for. Nicely directed. The chase scene is the best,as it immerses the audience as a 3rd person in the event. Real action sequences between characters give it an authentic and grounded feel. Chris Hemsworth has done a great job. So does Randeep Hooda ( soo rooting for this guy! After the great hit he took for his previous release being shelved, this a great comeback! Underrated actor in bollywood). You get the works from choppers, to grenades- top quality action quite forget it was suppose to be an extraction not a warzone in middle of the city. Kudos to Hargrave who can bag this one to his high-profile stunt portfolio (with the likes of avengers etc)THE STORY:\nJoe Russo (found out after then movie) does his best in delivering a new edge to an action movie. With audience saturated by so many movies and not to forget now are self proclaimed critics hard to please it's really hard to make a movie with a good story. But I think Joe Russo delivers. People will compare and be like \"oh this part this part that\". I'll just take your phone and shoot a scene at the most. Then let's talk.SIDE NOTE:\nYou got to give it these Directors, Writers, Production, Make artists a standing ovation as high stakes and efforts are put in. It's easy to sit back relax, watch and comment on a movie takes 3 mins at the max. But takes months of hard work, effort and times accidents just to make a movie.DRAWBACK:\nIt's sad but realistic avengers ending. \ud83d\ude2dCHERRY ON THE TOP:\nThis is movie is available to you for just 10 USD/M (among a large library of entertainment). So stop complaining (lol). Also where would you get to see Hell boy and Thor battling it out.And no I don't work for Netflix or the Movie people. Haha.",

It was so well written and shot that even a few lines gave insight to the mind of the characters.

Great shootouts, lovely locations, average script, but it's hardcore action near on par with great international movies like the Raid.\nI congratulate the director and scriptwriters for leaving the politics out.

The alleged kidnapping had no relation with what happens next; Chris Hemsworth's character could have been a deranged psychopath who kills law-enforcement officers for fun, and the movie would have remained the same. An apparently righteous hero cannot justify killing law enforcement officers who were probably just following orders. And those orders were justified too - especially after Chris Hemsworth's character killed dozens of uniforms.The trailer said it was a fight between two drug lords. We never see any of the alleged drug lords to be involved in any drug business. None of the drug lords command a big army of their own.The drug lord of Bangladesh was not believable in his role, not sure if he was a bad actor, or he simply could not pull off a foreign language.Next, there is the issue of the Dhaka city. Except for some aerial footage, none of the scenes were from Dhaka. They portrayed a city in some dirt poor country, war-ridden African country - and Dhaka did not fit the bill.Also, the movie does not show anything quintessential Dhaka - if they claimed to be taking place in Colombo, Kathmandu, or any other city - they would have to change only a few props. Moreover, no actors spoke in any Bangladeshi accent. In fact, it was obvious they were all from the Indian state of Bengal. This is why directors should not use a cultural reference without understanding it. The saddest part was, they could have hired one or two actors and screenwriters from Bangladesh, and do this better.However, no amount of cultural course correction could have made the movie better. This was the very definition of a cliche movie - which was probably fine as long as the movie did not claim to be something bigger than that. In the end, I did not even remember the name of Chris Hemsworth's character, nor the name of David Harbour's character, and I never cared for any of them.Netflix should make better investments in the future!PS: if finding Bangladeshi actors were that difficult, then they should have flipped the story. The Indian drug lord could have kidnapped Bangladeshi drug lord's son.",

U-hu. Who cares?The father of the boy is imprisoned and tells his right hand guy to get the boy back at all cost. All right. He just has forgotten that all his assets have been frozen. (Except for his villa, his luxary cars, his huge staff, the means to send the boy to a private school etc.) Anyway, they got the boy not for money but to humiliate him.His adjutant hires a mercenary troop from the USA (?!) to do the job. A dozen professionals with high tech equipment and a private satellite. Taylor, our hero, gets into the den of gangsters to \"negotiate\". The kidnappers want the money. Huh? I thought it was about humiliation? Anyway, he grabs the boy and shoots his way out. By the way, the gang members seem not to know how to load or use guns.Taylor sends proof to his contractor that he has the boy. But, alas, he gets no money! They were played! And they were obviously that stupid not to demand half of it up front, as any good contract killer would do. Instead the father's adjutant, a former special forces guy himself, kills all mercenaries on the field and tries to snatch the boy from Taylor to present him to his boss and save his ass (which was threatened by him, although he has no more men out there nor money to hire any).The other drug boss controls all of Indian's army and police forces who hunt now both of them. Much shooting and killing. Taylor refuses to give up the boy, although he won't get paid. He wants to bring him back. To whom? On the way to a bridge they must cross to get to safety (what exactly makes it safe, except for the \"game rules\"?), he gets attacked by teenage gangsters which he spares, again. Why? Because he has such a good heart as a contract killer? Unprofessional.Then the big final at the bridge! Taylor gets shot several times, among others by the corrupt general. He has the ability to sharp-shoot from all sides at once! He even gets Taylor's friends on the other side of the bridge! Amazing!The boy gets over the bridge and is save (game's mission accomplished). Taylor gets shot by one of the teens he had spared before and drops into the water.Epilogue: The other drug boss gets shot by one of Taylor's buddies and the once timid boy jumps from a dive board into a pool. Maybe Taylor is watching from afar?Woah, what a bunch of crap! It's a first person shooter turned into a movie with the usual psycho killer who has actually a soft heart. Only teenage boys who get a hard-on when they play Call of Duty can praise this junk.Sad times.",

            "content": "Currently one of the most savvy and successful businesses in the world, with a model that knows exactly what its audience wants and delivers entirely too that, Netflix have been churning out sleek and fast-paced action films ad nauseam over the last few years, with their new adrenaline fueled tentpole Extraction fitting the modus operandi perfectly.Backed by Marvel hero's the Russo brothers, with Joe penning the script and directed by long-time Marvel stunt coordinator and performer Sam Hargrave, Extraction is an instantly familiar action experience that sees Chris Hemsworth's downtrodden but Thor-like Australian mercenary Tyler Rake end up in Bangladesh trying to rescue the son of an Indian crime lord who has been kidnapped by a rival operator.Anyone that has ever seen an action thriller with a seemingly cold-hearted and depressive central figure, whose also a one man killing machine, will know exactly where Extraction is taking us, as the mission Rake is on goes sour and he is forced to take down what feels like a city worth of bad guys to protect his new mate Ovi.Similar at times to Man on Fire, Mile 22 and filmed in a way that feels like a direct rip-off of The Raid franchise (in what is becoming the normal now for Hollywood films trying to replicate the energy and frenetic nature of those action classics), Extraction fails to bring anything new to the table as Hargrave ticks off a serious of boxes on his way to an all too familiar conclusion.It's not to say there aren't little action delights along the journey Rake takes, with a clearly CGI'd but none the less impressive unbroken action set piece around the 30 minute mark of the film one of the candidates for the best action showcases of the year but there's far too much of Extraction that is forgettable, unbelievable and tiresome to bring it home with a bang.This forgettable film nature is a trend that Extraction lead and beloved Aussie icon Chris Hemsworth needs to pay close attention to, with his work outside of the Marvel universe and the well-liked but financial failure Rush is cause for concern.Films like Blackhat, In the Heart of the Sea, 12 Strong and Bad Times at the El Royale might not be the worst films going around but their far from the type of products you'd want littering your career for too many more years to come.Final Say -Some nice action moments are to be found in Extraction but outside of that this charmless and unimaginative action thriller is the exact type of Netflix outing that is still too prevalent for a company looking to reach for the low hanging fruit too often.2 garden rakes out of 5",

            "content": "Extraction offers the familiar action-movie combination of breakneck pacing, a paper-thin storyline, and dazzling set-pieces. As the title suggests, it's about a mercenary by the name of Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) carrying out the extraction of a little boy (apparently, the son of a drug lord in India) from the clutches of a Bangladeshi drug lord. Aiding him covertly in his mission is a team led by Nik (Golshifteh Farahani, who's best known for About Elly). A subplot brings Saju (Randeep Hooda), the Indian drug lord's enforcer, into the scenario. What ensues is a series of ultra-violent, well-crafted (and tastefully shot by Newton Thomas Sigel) action-movie clich\u00e9s.Hargrave chooses to cover up the fallacies in the script, some inane casting choices (Priyanshu Painyuli, for example, is a particularly bad one), the lack of locational authenticity (most of the film is shot in India, not Bangladesh except for plateshots), and disjointed Bengali lines mouthed by the gangsters, with neatly choreographed action. One such set-piece (shot like it's a single take) that gets going shortly into the 35-minute mark, is probably the best I've seen in recent memory (which is why it gets a 3 and not a 2.5). The action is punctuated by bullets whizzing past narrow alleyways, hand-to-hand combat that we've seen done better in Asian films, and a sufficient amount of blood-spilling.Heck, in what seemed like a minor nod to The Raid films, Tyler uses a rake (which is also his surname, mentioned later in a scene) to dispose of a thug. The single-shot-set-piece is straight out of the books of \"Call of Duty\", with the camera splendidly juggling between first-person and third-person action. Even for a hardcore action flick, Joe Russo writes in a few scenes that attempt to humanize the characters of Tyler and Saju. They aren't exactly acting showcases, but they get the job done. Plus, the presence of Randeep Hooda subverts the 'white savior' clich\u00e9 to a certain extent.While the scenes involving the Bangladeshi drug lord (dressed in awkward costumes) were the weakest (in terms of writing and performances), I did like how Hargrave portrayed the plight of underprivileged kids in the Indian subcontinent and how they were being used as gun-wielding henchmen. It's a template action movie alright, but there's enough machismo, explosions, and gore to please fans of the genre. It, however, needed better writing, a (much better) baddie, and more heart, to rise above its surface-level coolth.",

First off, Hemsworth is finding his niche and excelling in it. He has his body and his acting lined up and the audience likes both. The director took that and his skills and gave us a adrenaline rush of a movie so action-packed that not only makes the point of not giving up but things aren't over until they are. Good story, twists, special forces, weapons galore and the scenery or locations are impressive for their realism. Might I also point out that we get some good closure at the end which viewers must have if movies like this will thrive. Highly recommend a tasty snack or two (to ward off biting nails) and a tasty drink",

Not for lack of trying on the writers' part, the bulk of quality in this is movie is Hemsworth shooting his way through India. The reasoning of which really isn't all that important, in fact, it is a designed adversity that he is trying to save a kid's life. Without even watching the movie, I could have told you it wasn't worth killing so many people to rescue one kid.The action is excellent and worth watching the rest of the movie: hell, you could even fast forward through the parts where they're not fighting. It reminded me a lot of Daredevil series, but focused on guns.If you want to see some good action, give this a go, but I can't guarantee the actual story is anything you'll really get into.",

The camera work is a little disorienting at times, it does make you feel very close to the action but the constant tilting and movement gets annoying quickly. Also the story is sort of OK, the motivations of the bengali drug dealer aren't very fleshed out, and Chris Hemsmworths characters follows played out tropes of a soldier thats lost it all and finds his salvation in rescuing the kid. Despite all that this is a fun movie, even if some of the action is a bit intense. Definitely a good distraction during the quarantine.",

The problem with making a film like this one so gritty and realistic and violent and dark, is that the plot and script must also represent this. This script and story dont even try.The entire premise makes no sense...they insist on saving one kid for an evil drug lord...but dont mind killing 100 or 200 other people with children of their own who are just following orders and are probably just decent policemen who have no idea what's going on.And they wont even get paid for it.And theyll all probably die.And, somehow, in the opener, one guy double crossed them and knew exactly where all his team was, even the guy in the woods. Such a bad lazy script all around meant only, one mist assume, to practice new stunts and choreography.Beyond that, it is obvious that you will know all the cliches and tropes. But. You wont see some of the car hits coming because they are well shot, but also completely nonsensical since they come one after another, yet no one sees are hears them coming...again and again. Are the streets in india or Bangladesh covered in silent and cloaked electric vehicles? How about a gun and knife battle with cars and people that see it and completely ignore it and just try to get in the way of it. I mean, it is action and looks cool, if not real all the time, but it makes you groan often.The acting is actually good all around, even the kid.Oh, and of course, a beautiful woman gets the last kill without warning or explaining any of it, including what exactly physically makes her equipped to be such a character or how she possibly gets near the villain.Frustrating.

Those who are saying gangsters don't behave in that manner in Bangladesh, well that's pure BS, homeless kids throughout the sub continent are taken advantage of by evil people, and we all know how the authorities can be bought, don't duck the truth face it.Finally, two negatives, I guess the movie could have been 15 mins shorter, the actor who play the kidnapped kid could have been replaced with someone better.Watch this movie, and ignore the scores given by the pro Bangladesh activists,",

Since it's directed by stunt coordinator Sam Hargrave, I had a feeling the action would be impressive and indeed it was but everything else was lacking in comparison.Extraction follows Tyler Rake, a mercenary who goes on a deadly extraction mission where he has to rescue a huge crime lord's kidnapped son.The biggest enjoyment you can get from Extraction is the action sequences. I have to give a huge amount of credit to everyone who worked on the choreography of the action. All the action scenes are brutal and look very realistic. There is this incredible 10 minute sequence that looks like it's done in one take which is any action lover's dream. The camerawork and stunts during that scene are really well done. I can't imagine the amount of time that would've been invested just on that one scene. I wish I could say the same for the script.If you're going to watch this film for the plot and characters, then you will be disappointed. The Russo Brothers, who made films like Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, wrote the screenplay and it's pretty bad. Apart from the action, there is nothing else to it. We barely learn about Hemsworth's character and the relationship between him and Jaiswal was extremely underdeveloped. This made it so difficult for me to care about them especially the end where it mattered. David Harbour is in the film but he didn't get to do much. He was completely wasted. There wasn't much to the villain either. A movie like John Wick has great action scenes as well but at the same time there is a good amount of character development within it.Extraction is very forgettable. The action is commendable but I've seen better in films like John Wick and The Raid. Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Hooda were good but the material they had to work with had a lot left to be desired.",

            "content": "To all the numbskulls whingeing, get a life you girlyboy trolls, this is an action movie, no one gives a flying fig about what country its in, its not a flippin documentary chronicling an actual event such as \"lone survivor\" or \"13 hours\", its a high quality ultra realistic ultra violent fictional action movie in the same vein as \"Bourne\" & \"Taken\" & its a refreshing change from the usual Eastern European location.The story/plot isn't weak its mearly simple & that's all it needs to be, it doesn't need to be complex because its all about the action.This is simply a 1st class adrenaline pumping roller-coaster ride.Cinematography is excellent.Camerawork is excellent.Stunt work is excellent.Locations are excellent.Acting is excellent, not just Hemsworth but everyone involved.Now back to the whingeing girlyboys, absolutely no one watching this movie is going to make a judgement about the country or its people that are depicted in this movie, just like no one made a judgement about the countries or people shown in Taken or Bourne or Rambo or any other fictional action thriller, its over the top, over dramatised made up for maximum entertainment.Now its a good thing to be proud of where you're from but it is utter lunacy to protest that crime & corruption doesn't exist in the country you live, it exists & prospers in every village, town & city on this planet.Have some common sense & review this movie for what it is, it isn't a documentary, it isn't a biography & it sure as hell isn't a tourism video depicting all the pretty sites with all its pretty people, it's an action thriller & a damed good one at that.",

There is an entire action scene where it's basically one take with hidden cuts and it is incredible. More stuntmen need to direct movies because lots of movies fail at interesting action. However, the sacrifice really takes this movie down. The story and characters are so generic that any scene that isn't action is downright annoying. For some reason they spoil part of the end of the movie in the beginning even though it didn't add anything to show it in the beginning. And speaking of the end, the action started to become stale by the 3rd act and it felt a lot more like just walk shoot, walk shoot, walk shoot, and it was hard to fear for any of the characters because they are so basic. Overall, there is probably a solid 30-40 minutes of excellent action, a mediocre 30 minute finale, and 40 minutes of a generic story and characters. I feel this theme is very common in the Netflix original action movies such as Den of Thieves and I hope the sequel to Extraction is better.",

            "content": "Extraction is a brainless action film, which not only understands its identity, but under the competent helm of Sam Hargrave, is executed beautifully. Many action films feel the need to insert shaky hand-held camera (I'm looking at you Michael Mann), or worse still, frenetic cuts that are challenging to follow, but it's the use of steady-cam, and the smooth pacing, that really makes the film easy to watch.With plenty of shoot-outs, some fine looking explosions (though one is a little hit and miss), plenty of guys being thrown left and right by the protagonist, and the inclusion of the best knife fight I have seen since Jeong-Beom Lee's The Man From Nowhere, this film has virtually everything 'cept the kitchen sink. I had heard the film's violence was viscerally exaggerated, though I would disagree. It's no Freddy Vs. Jason, but it's no Jason Bourne either, so expect to see your fair share, but you won't ever need a towel to wipe it from your screen.A good action film needs an equally great villain accompanying it. Extraction, in this department, is rather lacking. Priyanshu Painfulli portrays drug-lord Amir, whose innumerable henchmen and child soldiers are enforced by Shataf Figar as the Colonel, who can authoritatively shut down the city of Bangladesh in a heartbeat when crap hits the fan. These characters are similar to The Voice in Man on Fire; rarely ever seen, yet their influence is around every corner. To exacerbate their ruthlessness, more screen-time was needed.The use of metaphor is well inserted on occasion, through dialogue and accompanying visuals, and it is this that perhaps gives the most depth to Chris Hemsworth's Tyler, other than the moments when he simply tells us his backstory to strangers, akin to Cruise and Foxx in Collateral (without the antagonism). He portrays a larrikin mercenary, his genuine Australian accent accentuating his tough guy image (because who doesn't like a good occa?), his boyish charms and poignant backstory making him incredibly likable. Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the teenager he is assigned to 'extract' from Amir, who has had him kidnapped for not only a large sum, but to show his imprisoned father who's boss, is also equally enjoyable to watch, and though he receives the same lacking amount of characterization, his humanity is an engraved part of the film.Randeep Hooda joins the cast as Saju, a bodyguard whose intentions are initially difficult to fathom, though his limited characterization reveals a family-man buried beneath his grizzled exterior. David Harbour's Gaspar, who is in the film for probably all of eight minutes, portrays a character who believes the end justifies the means, while Golshifteh Farahani as Nik, is easily the only character capable of stealing the light from Hemsworth. A brilliant tactician, who can control any situation, and can wield all manner of conventional firearms - she is the ultimate waifu.At the end of the day, the story is pretty bare-bones; boy gets kidnapped and must be rescued, with predictable double-crosses abound, though that doesn't make it any less entertaining, or recommendable - at the same time though, it is forgettable, requiring little in the way of brain power. For a film that occasionally breaks the 'show don't tell' rule of cinema, the end is very much multi-interpretative, adding depth to an otherwise two-dimensional feature. I personally think Hemsworth should be in more movies like this; gritty fun action films that remind us of decades earlier, when movies were more concerned with entertainment, instead of politics, whilst Hargrave has equally shown us that stuntmen, much like Chad Stahelski and David Lietch, make for some of the best action directors in the business today.",

The technical application is 10/10. The director of this is a stunt co coordinator for many famous films and he shows his skill here. Every shot, punch, death is immersive and feels powerful and real. They have long scenes that are blended and cut so insanely well.

I promise you many, many many stunt men were hurt in the making of this.Story: 6.5/10\nAs everyone states yes it doesnt have the best of story. Is it bad? Hell no. It's just typical.

            "content": "In Extraction, Chris Hemsworth does not have Mjolnir by his side. He still manages to ratchet up a triple digit bodycount to save a drug lord's son. How ungodly of him.The plot is as simple as it gets- India's biggest drug lord's son gets kidnapped for ransom by Bangladesh's biggest drug lord, and the former enlists Hemsworth's group of mercenaries for the rescue. Of course, the obstacles start piling up, and Thor summons up all the thunder he can to save the innocent.Neflix may have thought a movie set in Bangladesh offers novelty, but their treatment is so formulaic, that you replace Bangladesh with any other 3rd world country setting, the movie would virtually remain the same. The 10 year old child soldiers, machete waving teenagers, corrupt police forces and simply high gangsters could fit in anything set in Mexico, Africa or Burma. There is absolutely no attempt to develop the precious few characters in the movie, including the leads.Seems Chris Hemsworth is saving his laughs for Marvel only. Here he plays Tyler Rake- a mercenary with a heart of gold and lot of bullets- you know the kind of characters Arnold used to play back in the 80s. Regular Netflix stalwarts Pankaj Tripathi, Neha Mahajan and David Harbour play side characters, but the one man that really makes every scene count is a buffed up Randeep Hooda. He stands toe to toe against Hemsworth in the action sequences, and gets a poignant send-off too. Rest of the cast are caricatures of the highest order.Irrespective of the genericity of the plot, Extraction is probably one of Netflix's most well-choreographed action movie. and why not- given that director Sam Hargreaves has been the stunts director in a host of Marvel movies. Mind you, this is no Chad Stahelski, or Gareth Edwards stuff. Hargreaves trades off Chad's style, and Gareth's art for effective brute. It is a cocktail of everything you see in action movies- manic car chases, exploding helicopters, sniper fire, close quarter gunfights, and car crashes, and from a first time film-maker, really impressive at that.Am sure he will only get better- and learn to nuance his characters a bit more, and make his movies a bit less predictable.But the two things that make up my price of my time cost of viewing are the epic Thor vs Hellboy fight (can you do that, Marvel?) and making Hemsworth speak Bengali \ud83d\ude0aIndian don vs Bangladeshi don really? Whom did you think will win?\nExtraction- playing on your phone.",

However, the plot is weak. They do not explain why the 2 drug lords have tension and also why is the colonel listening to the drug lord of Bangladesh. The colonel literally has an army of solders he could that out the drug lord if he wanted. One more detail is unclear, after 8 months when Ovi returned to his normal life at the last there is a scene where he hold his breath underwater in the swimming pool just like Tyler when they introduce him at the beginning and a mysterious man in the background was watching Ovi. Is that Tyler if it is him the writers would'nt have just given it up if they were planning for a sequel. I really hope it is Tyler though.Overall a very good movie must watch, It is time well spent.",

Furthermore, Chris Hemsworth may be a no-brainer choice to play an action hero, but in here we can see he is a human who gets busted and injured. There is not much of a plot: hero extracts boy but things get messed up so he has to do the utmost to achieve his mission. That is the premise. But this mission also provides a character arc for Hemsworth's character, and in the middle of the story, he makes a choice. The real highlight of the movie is the action, of course. This movie pulls no punches with the action, there is a slight humor to it involving child soldiers too. I am surprised with the acting from the supporting cast. Randeep Hooda plays one of Hemsworths' nemesis in the beginning, and he is totally badass. I also rooted for his character. The style of shooting involves long shots, and immerses you in the story. The choreography is almost like John Wick, but in a more gritty setting. Thus, there are a lot of good things to enjoy from the movie. The weak point is the drama, and sometimes even the action drags down. The first part was great, but the action in the end was less exciting. But keep watching till the end anyway and you won't regret it.",

Randeep Hooda was surprisingly brilliant in his first full fledged Hollywood outing. Rudhraksh Jaiwal was also good in touch. Golshifteh Farahani was looking stunting. Good supporting role played by Priyanshu Painyuli.Script and Screenplay: This is the weakest point of this major project. There was nothing new offered by Russo brothers who directed magnum opus Avengers: End Game. They have placed one suspense which was quite obvious and it exposed quite early. When movie based on Indian backdrop, naming convention of father- son should not be western e.g. Ovi Mahajan.Action Sequences: Definitely this department will gave you some goose bumps.

Actually I hadn't even heard about \"Extraction\" before my friend spoke to me about it. But then again, I am not an avid fan of Chris Hemsworth, so I suppose that is why.But as my friend praised the movie highly, I must admit that I was having a certain amount of expectations for this movie from director Sam Hargrave. And I will say that writer Joe Russo actually managed to churn out a rather entertaining action plot.Sure, the storyline was rather simplistic actually, bordering on being near non-existing. But the sheer amount of action sequences and the dynamic way that the movie was shot more than made up for the lack of a deeper and profound storyline. I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the way the movie was shot, making it feel like I was right there in the action. Some accomplishment from the cinematography people here.\"Extraction\" is not a movie that relies heavily on a sound storyline, as it is all the action that does the talking. So having an excessive character gallery and good dialogue wasn't in the drivers seat here. But again, the action made up for those shortcomings.If you enjoy action movies, then you should definitely sit down to watch \"Extraction\", as it was an adrenaline-filled movie from start to end. However, this is hardly a movie that warrants more than just a single viewing, as the contents of the story just doesn't have the contents for that.I am rating \"Extraction\" a solid six out of ten stars.",

His job is rescuing the son of a drug lord who has been kidnapped by a rival drug lord.Along the way Hemsworth's character starts to see the boy Ovi as more than just a job. Everything that could possibly go wrong, does. Tyler (Hemsworth) decides that his mission isn't about the money any more and risks it all to save the boy. I really enjoyed Hemsworth and the actor who played Ovi. They had good chemistry together. The only gripe I had was the ridiculous part where the same thug kid who wanted to kill Tyler to impress his drug lord boss, is the one who actually is responsible for shooting Tyler at the very end. It was beyond preposterous.The soundtrack was very good and kept the pace up with all the action going on and with the more emotional scenes. The end it seems was left a bit ambiguous by the director. There are rumors of a series of films featuring the same character Hemsworth played and I would be pleased if this happens.",

This uncut scene also takes the action scenes of extraction to a new height, and you want to see it again and again.The story goes like this that Mahajan's son Ovi, the mafia leader of India, takes his rival Ovi to Bangladesh.Tyler Rake reaches Dhaka to remove this child from the clutches of criminals and lays a pile of corpses.This is what starts with guns, helicopters, trains, and human explosions that last.The film lacks emotion. The film could have been even better if the emotional track had been better in the movie, but those who could not evoke emotions while writing the Russo script. However, there is a lot of action.The story of the film is not that fun, but its action makes it worth watching.In terms of acting, the film is a film by Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Hooda. Both of them have given each other a competition; they have also done a collision.But both the characters are weak, just because of the script of the film. Rudraksha's acting is excellent.Priyanshu Painyuli has become the mafia leader of Bangladesh. His acting is the best, but his character is written so poorly that he does not do anything.Pankaj Tripathi's screen space is also limited to just one scene in jail. Golshifat Farhani, David Harbor, and Chris Jai Alex come for a little bit of fear.From this film, you have high hopes for action, as it is directed by Sam Hargrave, who has been the stunt director of films like 'Captain America: Civil War,' 'Avengers: Endgame.'Hargrave's direction style favors close-range clash and bust-up. He weaves in and around the action with Wild Fluid hand-held cameras, increasing speed and creating a feeling of being caught amid hyper-violent going-on to the viewer.If you leave the story and if you focus only on the action, then this film should not be missed because such action films will not come again and again.",

The technical wizardry aside, most of the intent seemed to be showcasing stunts instead of telling a convincing story. Much of this story has been seen before in other films, and there wasn't much humour in the script. Its actually a bit on the dark side as it ups the violence to unecessary levels - think The Raid Redemption.\nUses the 'white saviour' trope, and other cliches, as the battle-hardened, hard-drinking ex-marine-now-merc has vague flashbacks of a lost child or wife that sustains him and gives him his sense of aimlessness in the world, allowing him to mow down hundreds of cops in India, whether they're on the take or not. That's about all the character development we get - so overall, they could have injected a bit more life into the script.\nNot a bad effort overall",

Chris Hemsworth proves that he has acting skills and delivers a range of emotions even though the flashback about his lost child is brief and a little cliche. The action sequences are phenomenal and the long takes reinforce the tension and the adrenaline. The camera movements in the car chase scene are incredible and the shootout segments are well choreographed. Randeep Hooda is a revelation and the fighting sequences between him and Hemsworth are stunning, especially their hand-to-hand combat. Sam Hargrave manages to include in one single take a shootout inside a building, a car crash and a fighting with knives and hands. There is even a scene where the protagonist beats the hell out of some kids!!! Rudhraksh Jaiswal is an amazing talent and he is involved in the more emotional scenes of the film. Golshifteh Farahani plays a badass character as the friend of the protagonist and the scene where she fires an RPG is fantastic. However, there is no much to be said about the plot. The villain is way over the top for this specific movie and David Harbour's character exists only to add some minutes to the runtime. The subplot with the teen who wants to prove himself to the druglord is unnecessary and out of place. The ending scene is kind of unrealistic and the motives behind the abduction are never really explained.",

            "content": "Even before the world, cinemas included, closed for business during the current pandemic, the economics of going to theatres to see movies had become increasingly limited--mostly relying on tent-pole franchise installments. Disney owns a huge chunk of this business with childhood fare: remakes of their cartoons, MCU superheroes, etc. Not only have these new dynamics largely squeezed out the mid-budget drama from multiplexes, but also the traditional, usually stand-alone, macho action flicks such as \"Extraction,\" and \"Bright\" (2017), and \"Triple Frontier,\" and \"Red Sea Diving Resort,\" and \"6 Underground\" (all 2019). Now, if it's not already part of a series, chances are you'll only get this lack-of-a-brand type of adrenaline injection from streaming services and at home. Unfortunately, \"Extraction\" is a mostly generic burger of a movie from MCU veterans taking a break before making \"Avengers 83,\" or whatever.Stunt choreographer Sam Hargrave gets a chance to direct, and his background in filming fighting moves, along with the similar skills of the Russo brothers and Thor himself, Chris Hemsworth, shows. The next movie I saw after this one was \"Angel Has Fallen\" (2019), and it's painfully clear that the makers here put care into their craft, whereas the hacks behind the other one, despite it getting a wide theatrical release before making its way to Netflix, were merely there to cash checks. So, I do appreciate the action scenes here--especially the virtuoso, lengthy one-shot car chase.Otherwise, though, \"Extraction\" is a lousy entry in the trope of the White Savior. Others have commented how poorly the picture represents Dhaka, which just demonstrates how little filmmakers of white-savoir rubbish care about depicting the racial other. Narratively, only the white male hero's journey is made to matter--how sympathetic he is to the supposed plight of the Oriental, as opposed to their actual state of affairs or characterizations. Blah, I prefer my white-savior myths to have some knowing humor and time-traveling, purple Malthusian giants. If for little else, \"Extraction\" is helpful for realizing how much I miss fat Thor.",

            "content": "Avengers' director duo Anthony and Joe Russo, who co-produce this film with Hemsworth and action choreographer-turned-filmmaker Sam Hargrave, have gone for more than just locations while delivering an Indian whiff. If \"Extraction\" is billed as a high-octane actioner, a lot of the stunts would remind you of old-school Bollywood. For a change, this is not so much about contemporary Hollywood CGI razzle as it is about vintage Mumbai action masala, you realise as Hemsworth bashes up packs of armed goons or engages apna Randeep Hooda in some good old knife-and-bare hands sparring.Perhaps Hemsworth, Russo and Hargrave visualised it that way. An action film that will primarily play out on mobile phones cannot hope to impress with intricate SFX wizardry. Rather loud-impact stunts, kept flowing non-stop, are good enough for what actually is -- an OTT film.\"Extraction\" won't disappoint action buffs, in that sense. The film is unabashedly uni-dimensional in situations, plot and characters despite a backdrop that could have been tapped to create a smart socio-political thriller. Instead, the effort never deviates from its intention of being a loud stunt fest and little else.Joe Russo's screenplay draws from a graphic novel that he once co-authored, titled \"Ciudad\". While the drama in the book is based in the Paraguayan city of Ciudad del Este, the film transfers the story to the Bangladesh Capital city of Dhaka (incidentally, the film was originally titled \"Dhaka\", too).Driven by the clear intention of cashing in on violence, Russo hasn't bothered to check much on the subcontinent's socio-cultural nuances (so typically Hollywood, isn't it). The thing is Ahmedabad simply does not look like Dhaka, never mind the deliberately done Bengali hoardings and occasional Bengali lines - in Bangaal dialect -- thrown in.Clearly, stunt director-turned-film director Hargrave gave more attention to a highlight 12-minute action sequence filmed on Hemsworth than storytelling details. The irony is the particular sequence brings back instant recall of Daniel Craig's by-now classic parkour chase in \"Casino Royale\". Even though that one came 14 years ago, it would still seem the hands-down winner in this stream of action sequences even today.\nThe plot is basic. Ovi (Rudraksh Jaiswal), the teenage son of a jailed drug lord (Pankaj Tripathi in a blink-and-miss role) is kidnapped by the gangster Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli). Hemsworth as the mercenary Tyler Rake is hired for a whopping sum to bring the boy back.\"Extraction\" is sketchy in its intent and execution. The drama operates on a nebulous kidnapping that is never explained. It's almost as if Joe Russo, before writing this screenplay, saw too many of those old Hindi action dramas of the eighties and nineties where you normally threw logic behind while setting up the hero as a portrait of machismo.Indeed, Tyler the hero goes to places where even Thor the superhero wouldn't imagine -- in the domain of the hardcore commercial Bollywood. He acquires infallible swag as he bashes up a dozen baddies singlehandedly, and spectacularly goes about with his mission. Oh, and he is lonely, too -- as brooding men of action normally are. Just for the heck of it, they might have given Hemsworth a love story too, and some naach-gaana!Pankaj Tripathi is wasted, Randeep Hooda gets a few scenes of note as an action star, and those who dig world cinema will be disappointed with the raw deal Golshifteh Farahani gets. Hemsworth fans won't be disappointed, though. It is a package tailormade for the hunky superstar -- it is his co-production, after all.Since it is time of lockdown viewers gonna enjoy this cause it contains action and a bit of drama.",

'Extraction' and 'John Wick' are quite different kinds of movies, but they are both upper echelon action. Hemsworth is an absolute beast and electric throughout.As stated with other reviews the plot is simple, which I have absolutely no issue with. Too often nowadays films are muddled with confusing or unrealistic plot twists. Something like this it's best to keep it to the point with the focus on fantastic action sequences.Speaking of action sequences, how about that continuous scene of 11 minutes and change? This is of course accomplished with several takes and gives the illusion of an uninterrupted thrill ride, but impressive nonetheless. That long of an exciting scene reminded me of the one at the beginning of 'The Revenant'It was nice to see Hollywood and Bollywood come to together and make this. It's not often we see movies like this take place in this part of the world.With the limited amount of movies we got in 2020, 'Extraction' is likely my favourite action movie of the year. A non stop adrenaline rush that delivers high quality fight choreography, stunts, and competent gun fighting. This is no doubt due to director, Sam Hargrave's extensive knowledge and experience in those areas. Well worth the watch.",

No one does, even my Indian friends and colleagues laugh about that. So please take it easy.This is an action movie. Sam Hargrave did a wonderful job. When I first heard about it I felt offensive and then I watched it. Then I realize I should be more liberal because it's just a movie. At least Thor is talking bengali here, \"Proman dao\".

            "content": "There's sure to be an outcry over the violence or the flimsy narrative that Extraction possesses however, the film is rated 18 for a reason and some of the best action movies ever made don't exactly have the deepest narratives either so neither of those are going to bother me when settling down for an action movie.Chris Hemsworth plays black market mercenary Tyler Rake, who accepts the deadliest mission of his career when tasked with an extraction of the kidnapped son of an imprisoned international crime lord. There's your narrative, it's a basic set up and it knows it, and they sure as hell waste no time in getting down to the nitty gritty stuff.Sam Hargrave comes from a background of working on stunts for some pretty high profile films and he certainly utilises that here in his directorial debut. Hargrave goes for the serious approach to his film so there isn't much time to stop for any comedy, which suits the film's fast-paced and brutal action sequences down to a tee. One in particular, a long take action sequence that moves from vehicles to an apartment block before falling down to the streets, is up there as one of the most impressive action sequences I've seen in a film, the swift camera movements and stunt choreography really something to behold.Hemsworth leads the film well with a dominating screen presence, whether it be scoring headshot after headshot on an armed unit or slapping a bunch of adolescent soldiers about. The physicality of the performance is demanding and it's impressively handled by everyone involved.The film does drag a little in places and it feels as if 15-20 minutes could be shaved off but I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't engrossed by what was happening throughout. Extraction has the added bonus of the lead character with the surname Rake actually killing someone with a rake. Bravo.",

            "review_title": "Chris Hemsworth kicks add in a really dumb,forgettable action movie",
            "content": "What interested me in watching this film was seeing Chris Hemsworth in a movie outside of Marvel and the fact that this film was produced by the Russo brothers who did amazing Marvel movies. However, this movie was a Netflix exclusive movie which is rarely a hit. The basic premise of the movie is Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) has got to extract the child of a drug lord in India who was kidnapped by the drug lord of Bangladesh for money. Simple.Starting with the positive and probably the biggest reason why anyone wants to watch this movie, the action. This movie goes for a John Wick style of action with its incredible choreography and fast pace action. The action scenes are extremely violent and brutal which is borderline gratuitous but so entertaining. There is one particular action scene which is filmed to make it seem like an 11 minute one camera shot scene and it is really good even if the cuts are obvious. Praise should also be given to Chris Hemsworth's performance who gives a lot of likability and charisma for his character. Additionally, it is clear that Chris did a lot of the stunt for this movie and the director utilized this properly and effectively. The soundtrack and cinematography are also pretty good especially considering the scenery and high octane action.This is where the praise ends. How was this a screenplay/story from the Russo brothers? It's very barebone and has a lot of forgettable dialogue. There is a plan from one of the drug lord that just feels really dumb and done so we can have a cool fight. Additionally, there are non-action moments in the movie where it just feels like time panning and slowing down the momentum. These moments would be fine if it felt like it was adding something but these moments are a bore with mediocre dialogue and boring characters that it is uninteresting. The movie is also very predictable and this is due to the fact that this movie adopts way too many cliches from older action movies but just giving a fresh coat of paint. These moments made me just wish they would just get to the next action set piece already. On that note of characters, they give some backstory for Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) and the ex-military man who was hunting him to make him sympathetic but that's it. It would be nice to have been shown and not just told stuff about him because it just feels like a throwable line just to quickly give Tyler some characterization. What about his relationship with the mercenary girl or even David Harbour. Speaking of David Harbour even though he is a great actor, his character is incredibly forgettable. Every supporting character is forgettable to the point that I don't really know anything about them. The kid that Tyler saves likes playing the piano and is a son of a drug lord but apart from that, we know nothing about him. I would love to know more about his character by exploring his relationship a bit more with his father and ex-military dude or even how life is like as a son of a murderous drug lord. Furthermore, the relationship between Tyler and the kid just feels incredibly rushed and unearned. They just suddenly have huge trust in each other without any conflict which just feels unnatural. A lot of critics have bashed its aimless violence but it doesn't really bother me but I do feel that it doesn't feel necessary a lot of the times. However, the last act of this movie gets really tedious by giving hoards of mindless goons for Tyler to kill that just kind of makes you feel numb and bored of it.If all you want from a movie is Chris Hemsworth kicking ass then this movie is really good. The director was definitely a stunt man as this movie has great stunts which shows the experience of a veteran stunts person. However, these action scenes don't really do something drastically new so don't expect anything revolutionary either. The action is all this movie got going for it. If you expect a good story or good characters similar to John Wick then this movie does not have that going for it sadly.",

New actors not typically seen on US screens also adds originality for the American viewers. And Chris Hemsworth has strong performance during the action scenes and while taking a pause now and then. Do miss his comic side, though.I think if you expect seeing an action flick, you will not be disappointed.

Children don't carry rifles on the streets of Dhaka in broad daylight. It's a horrible misrepresentation shown in the movie. If I didn't live in Dhaka myself, I would be mistaken into thinking child terrorism is normal in Dhaka.2. Law enforcers in Dhaka - whether it be DMP, RAB or any of the defense organizations - are NOT incompetent and incapable of stopping two random guys flying in from outside the country. They do their job well, which is why we can go out, visit places, hang out with friends and more without worrying about random shootings (like they show in the movie).3. Dhaka's streets are NOT violent and it's NOT normal for people to fight in public with guns and swords. The movie made it seem like the people are used to things like these happening and somehow it's the norm here.4. An entire movie set to be in Dhaka and not a SINGLE major Bangladeshi character played by someone who SPEAKS the language and dialect that we do in Bangladesh? Are you for real, Netflix? All the major characters spoke Bengali like they do in West Bengal / Kolkata - NOT how we speak in Bangladesh - although they were representing characters in Bangladesh. Why? My mother was an actress, a lot of my friends are too. I'm sure many Bangladeshi actors could do those roles better than any of the ones who did, WHILE speaking our language/dialect.Overall, it's a horrible misrepresentation of the country in front of the world by a cast which isn't even 1% Bangladeshi. People abroad don't know a whole lot about Dhaka, but after they watch this movie, they might get the wrong impression that Dhaka lacks law enforcement and is filled with violence.This is not my Dhaka, this is not any Dhaka.PS: This is my opinion on the movie, as someone who was actually born and brought up in Dhaka. I was offended by how they represented my city, and I want an apology from Netflix.",

That Sultana Kamal Bridge is more beautiful than what you showed in the movie.2. There are some slums in Dhaka but that will not be more than 7 or 8 small slums right now. But you have shown that all city is a slum.3. Dhaka's road is more cleaner and buildings are more beautiful than what you have shown in this movie.4. Police dress, Army dresses are not accurate at all. You have shown a police man wearing both Police badge and Army Force named badges.5. Huge spelling mistakes in Bengali police man's name plates, banners.6. That kind of dirty shops and houses don't belong to Bangladesh.7. There are so much traffic jam in Bangladesh which is true but you will see all famous car brands in the road. But you have shown some junk cars everywhere.8. There is no jungle exist near Buriganga river.9. All Bengali pronunciations are so bad and inaccurate.10. There is not teenager goons available in Bangladesh with arms.11. Bangladesh Police uses better APC like Kobra Otokar12. You can't enter into Bangladesh swerage line in that way and height is far little than that you have shown in the movie.13. In near Buriganga river there so much beautiful historical places available. Dhaka is a continuous city for more than 400 years.14. Bangladesh people don't wear that kind of Panjabi and costumes. Most of the people here wear western dresses, and different Panjabis.15. Police, and obviously no army person will take order from a drug dealer in Bangladesh.16. No drug dealer can live in that way in bangladesh. Either he will be jailed for sure or will be died from gun fight with the police.17. Bengali speaking actors should be more professional with Bengali pronunciations and acting as well.18. Bengladeshi very low class hotel has better architectural units than what garbage you have shown in the movie.If you make something please do better study and research on that. Before making such thing on Bangladesh name first visit Bangladesh. In case you need free air ticket you can knock me. At least I can clear your wrong perceptions. Not every country look like africa or mexico what you should remember always.",

I didn't rate this one too low, because there's potential at certain moments of the film. For example, there is a very cool continuous shot sequence near the beginning of the film when Tyler is in the process of extracting Ovi. The driving was a little distracting since you could get clearly tell he wasn't driving (I know that's obvious, but it shouldn't look obvious). A couple issues I had with the film is the sporadic writing and with the end of this film. There's also a female character, Nik, (Golshifteh Farahani) who seems to be close with Tyler, but there's no explanation of their past. They did announce working on a sequel, so maybe they'll explain there, but I digress. Wasn't my biggest qualm with the film. For me, that came with the end of the film. I understand dragging emotional sequences out, but when someone should be dead, they should die. Not everyone is Superman out here. There's only one to my knowledge. Maybe there are more supermen. Maybe this was a Superman prequel idk. Either way, the film wasn't horrible, but I'm not itching for that sequel. 5.9/10.",

But the director or the writer does not aware of this fact I guess. In the movie, tons of life has been blown like crackers. They must have been dreaming while making this movie cause who kills a couple of thousands of people to just save the life of a kid. You can think that I kinda rude but think about it properly. if the kid is captured by a terrorist group and there is no state's authority to do anything then somehow it is understandable. But no what we see the movie that a bunch of druglords pets capture that kid. ok so extract him from there. But no our mighty hero has gone too far. He just started a war with the state. Like he kills police and RAB and army personals just like a piece of cake.\nI have never seen this kind of stuff before like a war against the state by a hitman who works by a darknet hitman agency.And this is not Bangladesh. There is no such drug lord in Bangladesh at all. And Yes many of our policemen are corrupted, sometimes they don't do their duty properly and sometimes they exercise the power beyond their jurisdiction. But when it comes to the safety of the people of Bangladesh, they act solid. They don't have all the types of equipment that they need. but when a situation arises, they are the most efficient force in this world.

Those fed up of quick cuts in recent action movies would be pleasantly surprised to find long takes in this film (in this case, a prolonged single-shot action sequence!) instead of fast cutting. The color tone is rich and suits the film's own tone. There are a couple of dramatic breaks between the action that make the viewers root for the characters.Chris Hemsworth delivers an impressive performance that gels with his character, while Rudraksh Jaiswal also presents us with a neat act. It's finally very satisfying to see Randeep Hooda doing a character like this. Make no mistake, he's done a couple of action films before but never did he play a tough character like this: one that allows him to both throw a punch and emote whenever needed.Extraction is also surprisingly realistic in terms of how it doesn't want to turn heroes into indestructible characters. When they get hit, they bleed. When they are injured, they feel pain. And given how all of this is done masterfully during its video-game style action, Extraction fulfills the action genre to its fullest. Again, since there's no way one's gonna step out and pay to buy tickets and popcorn to a movie at this moment, it's better to stay home, grab some snacks and prepare yourself for a thrill-a-minute, no-nonsense action ride called Extraction. Action aficionados are definitely in for a massive treat.",

They let it breath, literally, making it feels real and very much like you're in it with them. As a result there is not much suspension of disbelief needed. The fight scenes, close quarters fighting chases and gun battle have a danger feel to them and a high cost throughout the film. I have a favorite fight scene though, all I'll say is kids.The directing is very smart with the tracking, using the idea of camera posing to hide the stuntman but using it in tracking shots, making us watch one way at some interesting thing while you know what's happening off camera, then picking back up to where we were it's amazing. Sam Hargrave delivers big time, he's one to watch.The acting is amazing, top notch, it pluses the story and help carry the emotional weight. The cast is region accurate and the actors are great. Hemsworth did not hog the screen time - take note Robbie - and was surrounded by talented actors.By the way I totally spotted a Thor reference, did you ?Extraction, sponsored by Tupperware - don't think I missed the Tupperware bottle Hemsworth gave the kid - is a really good movie.

Lots of mindless action, and strong performances by Hemsworth and the Indian dude who's name I won't pretend to know by Googling it just for this review. Nothing to complain about too much. Not a masterpiece, but vastly better than the majority of Netflix Originals I've seen so far (6 Underground, Spenser Confidential and Red Notice come to mind as sub-mediocre). Some of the Netflix Original Series are pretty strong, like Stranger Things, Daredevil and Punisher, but their films just seem to fall short more often than not, so this was a welcome change. Extraction 2 supposedly on the way, I wouldn't expect it to be much different. A film like this is absolutely nothing compared to films like First Blood or Sicario. I would really like to see Netflix finally rise above routine mediocrity with their original big-name films.",

            "review_title": "A tribute to the genre",
            "content": "Whoever was born in the 80s grew up with a very strong incentive for action films, due to the influence of parents, the trend in the industry, the television network, investment in rental companies, everything conspired in favor of the still inexistent term \"shot, punch and bomb \", It was undeniable the happiness to see the films with stars of the genre. Currently, productions are very restricted when looking for some quality or some component that attracts all the attention and transforms the film, in fact, good; there are examples, of course, but with the number produced, the result should be better. This conspired for a feeling of emptiness in the hearts of fans of this iconic genre and when we come across a good production, the heart beats with happiness, that's the truth! Who hasn't been thrilled with John Wick? Action films can be very chic, just that the cinema made use all the good in your favor.The Rescue is an adaptation of HQ Ciudad, written by Ande Parks and the Russo brothers and is a project with long dates. Before it was released, the intention to take it to the cinema already existed, but many things have changed since then. The story narrates a mission by a black market mercenary whose objective is to rescue the daughter of a South American drug dealer, this in HQ; when starting the project, in 2012, the protagonist would be the star The Rock and the direction and cast was completely different, but everything changed, who took the lead was Chris Hemsworth, another thing was also the setting, exchanging south america for india and Thailand. The new chairman was Sam Hargrave, who has a long career as a stuntman in Hollywood and has acted as a stuntman and stunt coordinator in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, these names generated great expectations and the result could not have been anything else, one great action movie.When cinema is made with passion and by those who understand it, it is another level, not that others do not know, but being specific here, I refer to what the film proposes, action. the script is simple and common, the protagonist who is almost an army, traumatized and usually drinking, leaving for a mission that may be the last; there are many films with this premise and it is normal to some extent, what will differentiate is how it will be presented and developed, how the aspects will be addressed, the relationship between the rescuer and the rescued is an example of this, and how the setting will be built. I can say that the choice of a director (even if he is new to the chair) experienced in what is really action in the lens, was the biggest hit of this film, without a doubt. The realism presented is impressive from the first minutes, it does not take long for the director to put the camera in his hand and go out with everything, his experience helps to put himself in the right point of the take, in the exact rotation. By opting for less stuntmen on the scene, the audience's approach was also greater, the protagonist is present in many scenes that usually the face would be hidden, the style of filming also deserves to be highlighted. Hargrave uses several techniques to embody his film, the camera in hand already mentioned is used at various times to bring this realism, for sure the director lay down, knelt down and got up running to follow everything he wanted to capture, the dense scenery of an Indian city with those tight streets, full of people, cars, boxes, animals and everything that can be placed there, contributed a lot to the frantic and agonizing rhythm. There is an excellent sequence plan, another sequence that looks like a video game cutscene; the camera takes the action from the front, turns to the side, climbs, turns, swings, a door opens, shows the action of the character (engaging a gear), turns the look again, turns forward and continues, it is sensational.The action scenes with hand-to-hand combat are of a high level too, everything is organic and no matter how much you look for a defect it is difficult to find, again, the camera works well in the movements and everything happens, fight with a knife, shots with different weapons , neutralization sequences that make everything more plastic, shot in the foot, in the body, in the head, rotate the gun for better positioning of the body, change the type of weapon, return to the knife, go to the hand ... phew !!! It's really frantic. I couldn't imagine this film in America, the locations contribute a lot to the geography and the profile, the feeling of crowding at all times causes a claustrophobic effect and the yellowish filter causes a mixture that warms everything, that place looks like a hell of hot. At various times I found myself making comparisons with John Wick, for the plasticity, ignorance and at the same time, the subtlety in worrying about the details to make everything perfect in the eyes of the viewer.\nThe cast is very lean and obviously pulled by its biggest star, Hemsworth is an actor who has shown himself to be quite versatile, including in comedies. Here he is very well and has his role outside the MCU, I am not surprised if he stops being Thor, for some, and becoming the \"rescue guy\", the commitment to production brought an excellent result. David Harbor is another name known to the general public, but his character is very shy in production and has no prominence. On the other hand, Randeep Hooda, who plays the kidnapper's coast guard, deserves more attention. Hooda is very well known in the Hindu scene and brought a commitment equal to that of the protagonist, most of the best scenes involve his character and, as I said, the result is very good. The rest of the cast follows a well-defined acting pattern that does not compromise on anything, there is no one to say \"this actor is too bad\", despite having a very caricature tone in some. I understand that it was due to the Indian style, many actors work in Hindu cinema and have their own characteristics, the lack of custom in watching Bollywood films creates a certain visual barrier, I recommend even paying attention to this industry, which like any other, it has its mistakes and successes.The Rescue is a film that arrives to fill a gap and finally marks a hit by Netflix in blockbuster-like productions, pushing the mind, for example, Squadron 6. It is a great choice for today and is very worthwhile increase, especially if you are part of the generation that had a lot of fun with the eighteenth-century troglodytes. It draws attention for the already praised work of the director who, like Chad Stahelski, goes on the radar. At the end of the film, I only had a smile because the air was gone.",

It has excellent grounded action scenes, great set pieces, fantastic cinematography (I'm a sucker for those epic long takes) and a surprising amount of emotion in large part thanks to amazing performances by Chris Hemsworth and the kid who plays Ovi.True, the story isn't too much to write home about, but it gets the job done setting up the action that is the bulk of the movie. And of course it's an action movie in which one guy manages to take out entire armies so be prepared to suspend your disbelief a bit, but thanks to the excellent execution it never took me out of It. The movie catches its breath a few times and doesn't feel dull in those moments, thanks to the interactions between Hemsworth and the kid. Didn't know this movie was partially produced by the Russo brothers, but it made total sense after seeing it.If you like well executed action movies that don't just rely on CGI explosions and fast editing, give this a watch. You probably won't regret it. At least I didn't.",

After successfully completing this mission, he finds the kidnappers aren't as willing to relinquish their hostage as he'd hoped, plunging him into a deadly battle through the streets of Dhaka, where everything is not as it seems, and he can trust no one.As cinemas around the country (and the world, of course) are closed in the lockdown, streaming services like Netflix are going to be more popular than ever, as people, and certainly film lovers, will crave the sense of escapism that the filmic experience provides even more than they usually do. And, indeed, the main function of a film like Extraction will be to escape to another world, because there will never be any sense of realism in some action film where one man takes on a whole bunch of villains and defeats them without getting a scratch, the ones popularised so greatly throughout the 80s and 90s. Which the feature length directorial debut of Sam Hargrave ultimately emerges as one, big generic regurgitation of.Hargrave saturates everything with the standard present day dark, moody style, with a gloomy, blurred shooting style, setting the overall tone for the film itself. If it hadn't been so heavy and humourless, and a little shorter and less self indulgent, it could have passed as a harmless, run of the mill actioner, something to nod off to late at night, but instead it's one big, overblown event that seems to be stabbing at something deeper. Hemsworth is effective and convincing as an action hero, there's a depressingly authentic recreation of the Indian slums and it livens up at the end, with some pretty decent action, but it all amounts to the same thing.There's an Aladdin's cave of these type of movies in the back catalogue of films from the 80s and 90s, and there's plenty you can seek out, which will be over and done with much quicker and give you much the same experience.

Fun didn't stops from beginning to the end.\nThe action legend John Wick combat style clearly influences the context of the movie, but with a special touch.The combat scenes are breathtaking and eye-catching, as they are very elaborate and in an unprecedented new way that makes the viewers as if they're in the middle of the battle, so the director intended to create some of the realistic mistakes that happens with the hero during the problem in order to give more realism to the scene in addition to the way camera were operated, which was the main element in controlling the combat scene.\nColors, light effects, the sound editing, and visual effects of the shooting environment, all of these elements made the film and the combat scenes in particular a piece of dazzling art.It is not surprising to see this mastery in action scenes when we learn that director Sam Hargrave was the combat coordinator in the Avengers trilogy and the director of the Avengers End Game.The plot and script could have been better, One of the bad parts in the movie is the scene of killing Tyler Rake but he differently back from dead as the Teaser shot at the end of the film showed, it seems that even with the remarkable development that we noticed in Netflix's cinematic production, it still needs some directing.Last time i watched a hero dies and returns in the Slow Motion shot was in cheap Stallone commercial films. The supernatural power of the hero in pure action movies (except for fantasy and science fiction films) is no longer desirable.",

There are some cool scenes, a couple of big names, an \"escape the city\" type plot and some adequate acting.The ending is definitely where it flops (spoilers ahead.)Early on it's established that the hostage's father has no money to pay his ransom or for the mercenary rescue team- this is what the whole film is built on.The guy who is looking after the hostage at home dies after attempting to sabotage the rescue and save him himself to avoid paying the fee.Chris Hemsworth's character also dies, meaning that he can't then look after the hostage he's built a connection with.Therefore, we're somehow meant to believe that the crew of cold blooded mercenaries all decided to skip on their fee for rescuing the boy and are now supposedly paying for his school fees?He ends up back at his fancy private school, despite having no money and it also being established that if he remained in the city he would be killed. Yet somehow, 8 months go by with no retribution from the gang who kidnapped him and the leader then being murdered by a mercenary who, for some reason, was still in India.Oh yeah, and then it hints that Chris Hemsworth isn't dead, despite being shot in the throat and falling off a bridge.It's an entertaining enough watch on a weekday evening, but don't expect it to win any awards.",

I think the Russo brothers are trading on their work for Marvel and have probably let the success of Endgame go to their heads in making them believe that they can only pick 'winners' from here on out.Overall, the film has some good action but I was disappointed with it and it does feel like children running around a playground shouting 'you're dead' and 'you didn't take your shots'.",

It's criminally underrated for one being a female action drama/thriller which people will always be nitpicking about opposite movies like this one starting out at a solid 7.4. What? That's higher rating than Die Hard 2 and almost the same as Skyfall. Not to get started on \"6 Underground\" coming in with 6.1 solid stars with its big names not even making up for the lack of so many quality-based things, putting an emphasis on \"empty action and looks\".

I still don't get why action movies are always meant to have weak script despite of audience appealing genre. And also logic defying moments make it even worse like one or two mercenaries fighting against entire Bangladeshi police and Army to protect a child of an Indian Drug Lord. Also wasting talented actors for just one or two scenes or making them act like dumb makes it even cringe worthy show.Plot: Tyler Rake's team were hired to rescue son of an Indian Drug Lord from the clutches of Bangladeshi Pablo Escobar(That's how they mentioned him) who have hired some random local goons and kids to operate over the country(as absurd it sounds, it is a fact). While the action scenes and camera work is quite commendable, this wasn't expected to be that bad on paper. The Russo bros are regarded as Visionary directors after their stint in MCU but they're not visionary writers it seems(Joe Russo the writer has failed this time).Sam Hargrave is the captain of this ship and with a thin paper plot provided tried to make it at least worth a watch especially with cinematography of Newton Thomas Sigel especially the single shot scene of 10 minutes length(Though it wasn't exactly single shot but the team deserves applause).Performances wise Chris Hemsworth was leading from the front with one of his career best performance. The God of Thunder has proven himself to be a great actor as well besides being Thor. Rudraskh Jaiswal provided able support to Chris and he was worth mentioning. But the one who surprised me was Randeep Hooda! I've been a fan of his acting but never expected that he'll be such good in action sequences as well. The scenes between Hooda and Hemsworth were sparkling and wished more of them together. David Harbour had only two scenes and that too badly wasted it looked like he was there just as a distraction and unneeded speed breaker. Priyanshu Painyuli was also wasted in a rather unintentional comic role trying to make him look dreaded but ended up being a rather spoof of 'Bangladeshi Pablo Escobar' which didn't make him even remotely menacing especially if he uses local goons or kids to operate(besides the Bangladeshi army of course) the country and end up getting killed plainly. Pankaj Tripathi was there only in one scene that too for only 60 seconds and he exploded with his menacing look but that was sadly forgotten and avoided for no reason, those who know about Pankaj Tripathi and Priyanshu Painyuli(Bhavesh Joshi and Upstarts) would know how great actors they are. Amongst this all male led cast there was Golshifteh Farahani whom the makers tried to make it look important but sadly seemed disinterested.While the movie had its own moments but the overstretched climax and bizarre treatment to one note characters(except Hemsworth, Hooda and Jaiswal) ruined entire plot along with illogical over exaggerated moments. Watch it only for the Hemsworth-Hooda show besides the plot was disastrous.",

This is a live-action video game, based on a graphic novel, brilliantly photographed by Newton Thomas Sigel in and around Dhaka and with enough good guys and bad guys killing each other relentlessly to keep it on the boil for two hours. Brains may be largely in short supply but there's certainly no shortage of brawn.",

I did find plenty to enjoy, despite the average rating, but I can't score it higher because of the obvious flaws. Also, lengthy review and spoilers ahead...First scene, and we get the now overused flash-forward scene, showing Chris Hemsworth's character all bloodied and getting shot. This can be an effective way of starting a movie, developing a sense of intrigue or suspense. But it doesn't add anything here, and comes off a little cliche.The two lead actors, Chris Hemsworth (Tyler) and Rudhraksh Jaiswal (Ovi) do a great job, but there's not much of a script to work with. There's only one scene of any significant character development, where Tyler is the focus, talking about his past and his son. And there's not enough to make me personally root for him as a protagonist. It doesn't help that he's a mercenary who takes any job (\"sometimes I rescue people, sometimes I do other things...\"). He's just not a likeable protagonist.So... the final act, lots of confusing moments here. How was Amir's general watching the action on the bridge from miles away, and then a few moments later close enough to take shots at people with a sniper rifle? Why did Ovi nearly make it all the way across the bridge, only to run all the way back to Tyler when he got shot? Why were the team of mercenaries (who had already lost money after not being paid for rescuing Ovi) willing to stage an expensive rescue with several troops and a helicopter? Why did that kid from earlier show up to shoot Tyler? We know the kid was working for Amir, but everyone else involved in the shootout was either army or police, except this one kid. A lot of elements didn't really make sense and seemed quite contrived.Overall, like I said there are some positives. The action sequences are done very well, but if you like a decent plot and good dialogue along with your action, I'd look elsewhere.",

The lead actor, unfortunately, has less range than John Wayne, and I think we all know what that means. The direction and production values make up for this deficiency, and the Indian character actors actually steal the film quite easily.\nThink of the action sequences as eye candy and the main course of steak and potatoes is being done by the Indian actors. The street urchins of this Indian city were quite reminiscent of City of God, where orphans run rampant in Rio, Brail.\nThis aint your flying down to Rio film of the 30s.

The one-man rescue operation is Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth).Ovi was kidnapped by Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli), Bangladesh's biggest drug lord, who also controls the country's police and military,in Dhaka. Ovi, who lives in Mumbai with his father's underling, Saju (Randeep Hooda) who was in Indian Special Forces before,who knows a team that can bring the boy back to India.Tyler reaches the kidnapper's den: we get a longish violent showdown. Ovi and Tyler manage to escape: we get an even longer action set piece. The climax is expectedly more violent, where all the characters converge with an assortment of weapons.In the worst sceniario when things get complicated,all the world want Tyler to leave Ovi in Dhaka to save himself,he ensures Ovi that he will leave Dhaka only with Ovi though he will not get the money as he does not want to loss another child's life after losing his own child who was died by cancer.From then it was purely action sequence like car chasing in congested areas of Dhaka,fighting with cops,escaping from the guards etc with very limited story line.Based upon rural areas of Dhaka,it shows the effective power of Drug lord on the country's Security forces,Child labour including training them with varieties of heavy weapons from very young age to be extremist.From here on,someone attacks, someone counterattacks, someone monitors and plans.Screenplay by Joe Russo was good though the shots were too yellowish to show the impact of the rurality of Dhaka.When it comes to individual performances,Chris Hemsworth was outstanding at action sequences,dialogue delivering(specially those Bengali word \"Proman Dao\").The boy(Rudhrash) was equally good in screen but Randep Hooda as Saju was exceptional,his dedication towards the whole screenplay was fabulous,he hardly has left any fault to criticize.However for a pure entertainment and Action sequence adventure,You can surely give it a watch.",

It isn't. Unfortunately it's largely run of the mill, but it does have a few great action sequences that elevate it above similar straight-to-video nonsense.Ovi Mahajan (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), son of an imprisoned Indian drug lord, is kidnapped by Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli) his father's Bangladeshi rival. Knowing that he'll be held to account for this, Saju (Randeep Hooda) a lieutenant in the Indian family and Ovi's guardian engages a crack mercenary team to extract the boy. The team, with Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) on point, successfully rescue Ovi, but soon discover that Asif's massive influence of the Police, Army and his own street gangs make getting out almost impossible.As I said in the opening paragraph, there are a few action scenes in this film that are much better than the overall film deserves. The rescue scene is visceral exciting close combat stuff, but it was the later driving scene where I really started to take notice - particularly of the excellent camera work. The camera tracks the vehicle, circulates to the front when the car needs to reverse and then, in a bravura move, enters the car and sits on the back seat. There are a number of \"John Wick\" type gun fights for the remainder of the film which, whilst never quite hitting the heights of that franchise, are OK.That said, the rest of the film is a pretty predictable and generic thriller and you'll see the twists and plot points coming a mile off. I can understand why it had Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis attached at various points. Chris Hemsworth is OK, better than either of those would have been, even if it does feel like him playing \"sad action man\" is a bit of a waste, given his comedic talent. Randeep Hooda is given more of an arc, and provides a better performance because of it.Perfectly acceptable way to spend a couple of hours, but I'll never watch it again.",

So, what we have are these films that are appearing on Netflix, such as this one, not that I am stretched for anything to watch.This film confused me a bit because in part I thought that it was some Bollywood production, but it turns out that it is definitely an American film, though since Chris Hemsworth takes the leading role, I probably shouldn't have been too surprised. Yet, pretty much all of the other characters, with the exception of a couple of the protagonist's team, were Indian.The story is pretty straight forward, namely that the son of a drug dealer is kidnapped and taken to Bangladesh, and Hemsworth is hired to bring him back. As such, we pretty much end up having this huge action movie which is little more than Hemsworth verse the entire Dhaka police force. Yeah, it is a bit like though, though there are a couple of other antagonists thrown in, and a couple of twists as well.In a way it pretty much reminded me a lot of Blackhawk Down, namely that Hemsworth is attempting to get out of Dhaka the quickest way possible, and cities like Dhaka aren't the easiest to get around, especially when you have the entire police force after you, and being American (or in the case here, Australian), you do stand out quite a lot.Look, it isn't one of the best films out there, but it certainly does work well to keep you up with your weekly dose of action, especially since it is one of those films that is somewhat new. Look, the plot isn't that great, but the production certainly does work quite well, and it certainly does look a lot better than a number of other productions that have landed up here.

With people trying to kill them lefty and right, we wonder will they get out alive?\nChris Hemsworth gives a tough but vulnerable performance, shows his character not one way type of character. The India setting is also great, and action scenes are very intense, feels very real not just movie action. There are some surprises on who is on there side and who is not. So if you are in the mood for a good action flick, give this movie a look.",

Chris Hemsworth is obviously the standout, though Randeep Hooda and Priyanshu Painyuli are also noteworthy here. Those three, and a few others, give more than solid performances but I don't feel like they are anything extraordinary - mainly due to other factors.That also matches how I feel about the action. I enjoyed a lot of it in truth, a number of the deaths are pretty nicely done, though the editing/cinematography comes out odd in parts... yet it does still weirdly work.The set designs are something I, flat out, don't rate in 'Extraction'. All of the major scenes in that regard feel fake, like they've been created from scratch to look like a war zone... \u00e0 la what you get in video games, comes across too rigged.This film's premise isn't the most original, you've seen it all before and it can feel dragged out, though this still makes for a mostly enjoyable experience.",

            "content": "A Netflix original from 2020 starring Thor, Chris Hemsworth, as a mercenary tasked to rescue a kidnapped son of a jailed drug lord. The boy lives his life simply; going to school, dreaming of girls & getting back to an empty home run by his father's partner who tries to keep a tight leash on him. One night however, after leaving a club & smoking dope outside, some cops pull up & the boys try to play the offense away but when guns are drawn & the boy's friends are gunned down, he's taken hostage but no immediate demands are given. It turns out a rival drug lord has taken the kid to a neighboring country so Hemsworth, an Aussie military man, all biceps & emotional chips on his shoulders, & his team, including his liaison played by Golshifteh Farahani, warns him about the tenuous nature of the job but Hemsworth pushes forward regardless & although the initial snatching up of the boy goes easily (for a seasoned professional!), backstabs & betrayals occur when Hemsworth's team start getting knocked off by the boy's father's handler (he's been warned by the father to get the son back or forfeit his own family) while the kidnapper sends crooked cops en masse in hot pursuit to stop Hemsworth & the boy from crossing a particular bridge to freedom (& where the same guy who betrayed them suddenly joins the cause) w/every shot bullet felt & every blinding explosion forcing one to turn away, this is a thrill a minute actioner w/some inventive camerawork (an extended knife fight between Hemsworth & the nominal baddie is a treat for action hounds). David Harbour shows up as an old friend of Hemsworth's to lend a hand when things get particularly tough.",

Still as I've said this doesn't really matter in the moment as there is always something happening in this film (shoot outs and fisticuffs come thick and fast in this picture) which, in fairness, is what you'd come to expect with films of this nature.Hemsworth does a solid job (he's a good physical presence, but unlike some of his counterparts that we see in action films he also does well from an 'acting' perspective as well). The villains are a little clich\u00e9d, but nobody disgraces themselves here.Although it feels a little generic and underwritten the fast pace and neat actions sequences make it worthwhile.",

And some of us will absolutely loathe it because it has zero plot importance and weak characterizations!To be honest I find myself in the middle. Frankly saying; Most of us already knew what's going to happen with the movie. You can't really expect much in terms of depth from an out to out action piece! And it surely stands out on what it promised.This has some scintillating action set pieces, with breathtaking adrenaline rush. Although the same scenes could look familiar for Regular Action fans but they look pretty good on screen nonetheless. The camera work here is phenomenal in those particular moments. The screenplay might not be that great but certainly it shines the most whenever any action starts. The technical efficiency can be easily noticed. I truly admire the efforts that have been put in by the Debutant Director here. As far the production value goes this ought to be on the top tier as Russo brothers are behind it. Hence the Execution looks matured in thrilling moments. I must mention that 11 Minute long one take scene; that looks magnificent. The Hand to Hand Combats, the Gun Fights all looked great as well. It's apparent that The technicalities are the major highlights over here.The performances are decent enough. Considering it's the Action Genre. But character build ups failed to impress. The writing falls short on many aspects. The Kid Character, he acted pretty well but I wanted to see more from him and his past or daily struggles. Being a Kid of a Druglord must be a Burdening thing on a day to day basis. Pankaj Tripathi as Indian Druglord; Well he was literally in one scene. It's Unfortunate to see such a talented individual getting such a low recognition here. Randeep Hooda as Saju was brilliant. Chris Hemsworth as Tyler performed great. His dedication and hardwork pays off.\nThe Bangladeshi druglord, well I see him as more of a Cliched overpowered villain like we used to get in 80's rather than a more structured modern day one.In the end It's a fast paced entertainer that hasn't got much depth in it. But it's full of Gruesome, Violent stuffs that Action Junkies might prefer a lot. For an ordinary group of audience this would be a Fun, Popcorn flick. Nothing more.",

The action sequences are simply breathtaking; each and every action sequence is wonderfully crafted and some camera angles during the fights are surprisingly awesome. There are incredible hand-to-hand combats, exciting chases and other fantasically choreographed stunts that makes this film the most exciting, and joyously violent, film of 2020. There's even some good dark humour in there too. Chris Hemsworth gives one of the best performance of his career. Not only is he incredibly physical in the role, but I actually believed the emotional side of his character; which with Hemsworth isn't usually the case.

Basically, a forgettable film. I should mention David Harbour turned a corner several years ago (which is not atypical). Now, he is aalmost always cast as an antagonist. Take \"The Equalizer\" (2014). I think he weakens an already thin plot. It would be mire interesting if someone actually betrayed him. Audiences are smart. Still, I gave it a 7/10 for the excellent stunt fighting choreography, squib work, special effects, etc. Although there are are outrageously unbelievable sniper shots made (several appear over 1 mile away) and hit dead on. I bet you $1000 the Kid who shoots Tyler at the end will have a prominent role as a \"bad guy\" in the sequel, which is already \"in the works\".",

I am slightly disappointed as I'd heard great things about an action sequence oner and it was Netflix's number one film at time of watching. It didn't really live up to this hype, but was still an enjoyable action film nonetheless.The action was fun although a tad repetitive by the end. I did feel like we were getting the same sequences just in different locations for some parts of the film. Saying that though there was some great camera work during the close quarters combat, particularly a scene in an apartment building following a car chase. The choreography was always tight, maintaining a gritty and dangerous feel. Pretty unforgiving at times in its violence and pace, Extraction does provide solid entertainment.With regards to the plot... it was so so. Nothing stand out, nothing bad. There are some action films driven by plot, far more driven by action, and this was definitely one of the latter. In this sense then the plot was good as it facilitated the action sequences and they all made sense and flowed within the world that was created. Nothing felt too out of place or fantastical, with the action remaining (for the most part) in the realms of plausibility.Overall Extraction is a fun watch but nothing more. Its not revolutionary or ground breaking in the genre, but is a good two hours of entertainment and well worth watching if action films are your thing.",

            "content": "My Review- ExtractionAccording to Netflix we joined the over 99 million viewers to watch Extraction since its release in April 2020 which means it holds the record of the most watched Netflix feature movie so far . It's difficult to tell who watched the entire movie as Netflix registers anyone who watched two minutes or more of a movie as a viewer. Unsurprisingly, Netflix is working on follow-ups to both \"Extraction\" and \"Birdbox.\"a dystopian thriller starring Sandra Bullock which rated 89 million viewers .\nI watched it because I was interested to see Chris Hemsworth in a role other than Thor and I was impressed by his performance as Tyler Rake, a fearless black market mercenary, who embarks on the most deadly extraction of his career when he's enlisted to rescue the of kidnapped son in Dhaka, Bangladesh.\nChris Hemsworth obviously believed in this film as he's one of the Producers along with Joe Russo. Extraction cost $65 million to make, and producer/screenwriter Joe Russo argues that's around double the budget they'd have landed if it had released in theaters, and been funded elsewhere.\nThe entire ensemble cast are all very convincing in their respective roles but standout performance for me was 15 year old (at time of filming)\nRudhraksh Jaiswal as Ovi Mahajan, the son of Indian crime lord Ovi Mahajan Sr. who is the kidnap victim. He is excellent in his role and the quality of his performance reminded me of Dev Pate's debut movie appearance in Slumdog millionaire.\nReviews have been mixed Rohan Naahar of the Hindustan Times praised the performances of Hemsworth and Hooda, and wrote: \"Featuring one of the most stunning action scenes in recent memory...\nViolent thriller action films are not my favourite movie genre and believe me there is a lot of violence and blood shed in Extraction but I found it entertaining and the Action and stunt work is certainly well done and would have been even more spectacular on a proper Cinema Screen.\nNo wonder the film looks good it's Director Sam Hargrave an American stuntman, actor and director who is best known for his collaborations with the Russo brothers, including being the stunt coordinator for several films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe including all the Avengers films .\nScript writers include Joe Russo and Anthony Russo and they keep the action moving along at a frenetic pace.\nI can't say much more except after seeing Extraction I'm sure Chris Hemsworth will succeed in branching out for roles to replace Thor when he decides to put his hammer away. I've mentioned the violence ,is it excessive ? probably yes ,so if that bothers you Extraction may not be for you but perhaps like many I've become desensitised to it and I just look at it like a video game or 21st Century Cowboy film.",

Yes we South Asian understands how Dhaka/ Bangladesh or India looks but we need to grow up. The movies are an art of fiction. We dont judge other hollywood movies misrepresenting countries we don't live, so why this. Let us see beyond that and enjoy this action sequence. No need to spread hate and force bad ratings.",

            "content": "I'm pretty sure that no matter what, I was going to enjoy the Chris Hemsworth action flick EXTRACTION whether it was good or not. It is, after all, a NEW movie, albeit one that was made \"Direct to Netflix\", so those can be of lesser quality.I'm happy to report that in the case of EXTRACTION, that is not the case. This is a good (if by the books) popcorn action flick with a charismatic lead keeping you company throughout.In EXTRACTION, Chris Hemsworth stars as an Australian Mercenary (who knew there was such a thing), hired to extract the kidnapped son of a drug lord from the hands of his fiercest rival.This is a pretty \"by-the-numbers\" action film:1). The mercenary has \"baggage\" - will the events (and the subject he is to extract) help him come to terms with his pent-up emotions in order to move past his traumatic \"baggage\"?2). Will there be some sort of \"double-cross\" that screws up the extraction causing our hero to go \"on the run\" with his \"Extraction\"?3). Will there be a buddy that our hero trusts who will, ultimately, double-cross him?What do you think?The fun of this film was not the plot machinations (they are pretty basic), but the execution of these machinations - and this execution is pretty fun/enjoyable.Start with Chris Hemsworth as our mercenary - with the great action flick name of Tyler Rake. Hemsworth knows exactly what kind of film he is in - and he brings the goods. If he chose to, I think Hemsworth could be an action hero staple like Jason Statham or Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson - but I think Hemsworth is not really interested in that. But here, he is steely eyed and calm taking hits and doling out punishment to hoards of \"red shirt\" bad guys in his way. He has the action hero chops. He also has the acting chops to make the overwrought \"emotional\" scenes palatable. He makes weak writing enjoyable.Joining him is Rudhraksh Jaiswal as \"the extraction\" - and his interactions with Hemsworth are fun. Randeep Hodha and Golshifteh Farahani do a nice job in the roles that they play in the action and the always watchable David Harbour eats a ton of scenery in his limited time on the screen. All are fun to watch.But it is the telling of the story by first time Director Sam Hargrave that was a (pleasant) surprise for me. After doubling Chris Evans in the first CAPTAIN AMERICA film, Hargrave became the \"go to\" guy for Marvel action choreography, so (I'm sure) he got to know Hemsworth there. He brings a fast-paced style to this film that works. He doesn't stop to examine much at all (which helps the plot holes in the script) and his action work with his stunt actors is top-notch. If you watch nothing else in this film, check out the chase scene at about the 1/3 mark of the film. Hemsworth and \"the extraction\" are being chased - and it is filmed in the \"shaky cam/cinema veritae/ make it look like one long tracking shot\" style that I often criticize in my reviews - but here it worked and worked well. I'll be keeping my eye on what Hargrave does next (word is it that there will be an Extraction 2).All of this is brought together by Producers Joe and Anthony Russo - the Directors of many Marvel films (including INFINITY WAR and ENDGAME). Not only did they Produce this film, but they wrote the story from where this film came from. It's obvious that they turned the majority of the screenplay writing to others (most notably Ande Parks) and this film is based on a graphic novel...so it plays like an over-the-top comic book action flick (think John Wick-lite) where the dialogue is sparse and cliche-ridden. This part of the film was far less interesting than the action parts.But, the action is fast, fun and furious and Hemsworth is worth watching for the 1 hour 56 minute running time.All-in-all, a good time was had while watching the first \"new\" film in over 6 weeks.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

When one stands out among the rest though, I feel that a huge round of applause is in order. Extraction is one of Netflix's latest feature films to hit their service and it's probably my favourite film that they've released since last year's Oscar contenders. No, I'm not saying Extraction is award-worthy, but it's quite a ride. If you're looking for something new to watch, I think you'll be pleased with this one, even though some may find it too violent.This film follows a badass mercenary who's looking for his next big job in order to keep his mind off a troubled past. Being recruited to track down and extract a kidnapped teenager, who's father is in prison, this mission becomes his most difficult one yet. Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) is the brain and the brawn of this story and if he doesn't work as a character, the entire film would fall apart. Now, even though there is some care put into the emotional moments, Extraction is all about the action. If you're not a fan of too much violence or too much action, then I suggest looking elsewhere.Directed by stuntman Sam Hargrave, who has done many of the stunts for the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, pulls no punches in dropping you right into the action. From long single takes with fantastic fight choreography to the brutal amount of deaths throughout the movie, Hargrave, even though this was his first major outing as a director, was clearly the man for the job. Written by Joe Russo, I felt even more enticed to watch it, and while there's nothing all that groundbreaking about the script itself, it has enough character development to serve the action overall. I feel that Joe Russo could write a few more films that are heavy on the action because it seemed to work here.If I were to explain everything that happens throughout this movie, you'd think I'm describing something else you've already seen, but I really appreciated the fact that the incredible action scenes made this movie stand out. On top of that, Chris Hemsworth and Rudhraksh Jaiswal, who plays the kidnapped Ovi Mahajan, have some nice moments together. There are a few humorous lines to break the tension and a couple heartfelt interactions that gave the film time to breathe. I personally really enjoyed watching this one.In the end, as I said, Extraction won't be winning any awards and it definitely doesn't hold back in the body count area, so if that's not your thing, it may not be for you. For myself, I like a good action movie with likeable characters and this movie delivered on that for me. Sure, things feel underdeveloped and the film unfolds as you would expect it to, but it's all about the action and it absolutely delivers. Purely on an entertainment scale, I didn't have a lot of issues with Extraction, because I truly don't believe it was trying to be anything new in terms of storytelling. As long as you're okay with violence, I recommend checking this one out on Netflix.",

            "content": "Extraction is a lot to talk about.One should watch this film with an understanding that this is yet another film directed by a stunt coordinator, much like John Wick. So, there is not much to be expected in terms of story or characters.With this in mind, we encounter our first problem - Chris Hemsworth is very much miscast for the role. He looks ripped and all cool, he can do stunts, but he is too typecast as a good guy superhero to represent a generic washed up mercenary with no will to live. Also, and this is my personal humble opinion, he is not a good dramatic actor.This is where we find our third problem - the story is incredibly generic and unimaginative. You can easily spell out the dialogue before the characters do, just because you've heard it a million times.The film is a remarkably interesting combination of stunt ideas and cool scenes, mixed with inspirations and copypastas from other films, even the ones the director and the writer worked on together.What sucks is that all of these feel watered down, not even one of these borrows really works out in the end. The emotional connection base of a hired assassin and a kid who has no real family (for the assassin to become one for him) could not be done better than in Leon (1994) (or the Professional). The crime mogul intent on training a heir to replace him in time was also done before (but I can't recall now when and where), but in this film this plot goes absolutely nowhere, it just stops (while it could've been something interesting). The ending was also very reminiscent of the ending of Leon btw. The old friend subplot was super obvious, but it still felt like it was borrowed from 16 Blocks (2006). Some of the visuals of the film were inspired by John Wick (2014), Children of Men (2006) (the car chase), the shooting style of the action was reminiscent of 1917 (2019), the \"drowning in the water\" scenes were ripped straight out of Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) (interestingly enough, the director of Extraction was a stunt double for Chris Evans, even the music from these scenes was very similar because it was composed by the same composer.I can go on and on, but I think by now you get the point.Anyway, even well shot action scenes still need a script. They don't work without a good story, they just get tiresome and kinda boring, this was very well demonstrated by Michael Bay's 6 Underground (2019).There are lots of reviews of Bangladesh nationals who were offended by the portrayal of the country and the capital, but I'm not one of them (this is why filmmakers tend to use fictional locations).Besides the action scenes, I also loved that this film had that amateur quality to it, like lots of slow scenes that don't really go anywhere, but they just look smart.You also don't see Hellboy brawl with Thor very often, not even talking about Thor kicking and punching kids around.Interesting film in terms of how much they've put into it, still feels like a third person shooter video game with bosses and enemy respawns. Clearly not the worst of the stunt-directed kind.Easy watch if you're bored, but don't forget to disable your brain first.",

There were funny moments in Thor Ragnarock and it seems that this opened and hopefully closed the door on comedy.Now Extraction is for me Chris at his best.In summary a 14 year old boy is kidnapped by one drug barron who is son of another, his son lives with an employee his fathers (I'll come back to this later).Eventually we find out that no one wants Obi not even his own father so why did his father employ Chris Hemsworth to Extract him?The fathers friend who Obi lived with was then sent to kill Obi and Chris Hemseorth, why? Surely if he didn't want his son just simply don't pay the ransome, problem solved.So as you can see the story is silly especially as half way through the guy Obi was living with and who was out to kill them both suddenly decides to help, cone on!BUT.........As I've said above Chris Hemsworth has finally returned to what he does best, ACTION all the way!The 11 minute continuous scene starting with the car chase and escaping the corrupt police is absolutely amazing! How the camera transitions from inside to outside the car and following the action, one word WOW!Atomic Blonde did this but this film blew Atomic Blonde out of the water in my personal opinion and the action continue throughout the film.So forget the story and simply enjoy this film for what it is, an action packed movie with simply amazing camera work which has to be seen to believed.Rating 9 out of 10",

There are a lot of moments packed of tension and this is exactly how this kind of films should be made. The one take like scene at the beginning, required a lot of planning and care, but the result definitely pays off. Stunts artists made a wonderful job and VFX department realized amazing and very realistic effects.The story is basically non-existent, and the plot is extremely predictable. So, if you are looking for a profound screenplay, search elsewhere. I really wish that this production was a little bit more balanced. Characters are mono dimensional, not deepen at all. They are basically tropes, that I have watched many times. It is possible to create interesting and capturing narratives, while having great action. \"Atomic Blonde\" and \"John Wick 2 and 3\" are just a couple of examples. When I \"review\" a movie, I need to consider all the elements and having just technically solid and impressive scenes, does not suffice to create a captivating production. Beyond this, there is nothing more that I can really say. I gave six stars out of ten for the effort and I can understand what it took, in order to pull out certain things, but this honestly wouldn't be more than five stars.",

The action scenes are the highlight. The storyline was really just a backdrop to what were some of the best action cinematography and fight scenes I've seen in a while. There was a grittiness and realism which perhaps set it apart from the likes of John Wick - which it will no doubt be compared to.The setting of the film itself was a somewhat refreshing change from the usual.

            "content": "First off, I wasn't expecting anything going into this film. It came to my mind, so I watched it. And it was pretty entertaining. I was surprised by how quickly things went into gear in this film; it went straight into it.This film had notable aspects, and they also helped the film, as a whole, stand on its feet. But there were also other things; they weren't \"bad,\" but I can see why other people would look at them negatively. And while I say \"things,\" that's me being thorough, accounting for \"everything\" because there probably are other things that some people didn't like about this film. I only noticed one.There wasn't much of a plot. Plain and simple. It's pretty straightforward, easy to follow, and that, something with barely any substance, was turned into an entire film. Of course, most people probably expected that, and others weren't surprised. This film: action film, through and through. I didn't care, but I can understand why that would be a \"bad thing\" to some people.The biggest highlight of this film was by far the action sequences. They were well done: and if they weren't, this film would've flopped. It had nothing else going for it, although who knows how different it would've been if it wasn't an action film. But, as what it was, an action film, the action, being well done, saved it. They made up for any lackluster areas throughout the film. Those involved in the creation of this film understood the assignment. And they delivered. The core of this film was the action: nothing more, nothing less.Its second-biggest highlight, I'd say, was the camera work. It was creative. Usually, something like that never sticks out to me. There were instances where you'd realize it even if you couldn't care less about something like that, aka me. But it was well done and added a lot to the experience. Now, combine that with the choreography and direction of the action sequences: you're in the film.The score was also good. I'm pretty sure I read someone bringing up Inception. I was thinking of scores you'd hear in the Modern Warfare video games, and I suppose that kind of sound is pretty similar to scores by Hans Zimmer. So, that tracks. Yet it wasn't that identical-sounding, just reminiscent. Henry Jackman and Alex Belcher give it a distinctive twist.The acting was decent on all fronts. The actors who had elevated moments regarding that were Chris Hemsworth, Rudhraksh Jaiswal, and Randeep Hooda. The latter of which was the highlight for me. Not only that, his character was on par with Chris's character and brought most of the excitement to the film alongside each other.The cinematography was good in some areas with good shots. At the same time, I feel like it was lacking. More specifically, lacking \"something.\" I feel like it looked too bleak and grainy sometimes, and it's 100% not because of India being the primary filming location. With good cinematography comes making something somewhat subpar looking into something good looking; making something already good looking into something even better looking. It seems like Newton Thomas Sigel had his work cut out for him. But he also came up short.Regarding positives and negatives, I guess this film is half-and-half. But the most important thing to note is that the positives are radiant. So having said that, I don't think the negatives were that impactful on the film and certainly not on its enjoyment. At least for me.This film is by no means one of the best films ever. But it gets the job done/it got the job done. It was thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable to watch, and I look forward to the second film. I hope it's even better, especially the action sequences.Here are my other thoughts:I thought the title card looked cool and slick. Green was an interesting choice of color to use. I haven't seen that before. But it made it look even better.Golshifteh Farahani has quite good-looking eyebrows. A slightly odd thing to say, I know. But it had to be said. Oh, and she is quite good-looking, too. I hope her character is more prominent in the second film since she wasn't that prominent in this one.I was surprised to see Adam Bessa. I'm sure most people have no idea who he is. I saw him in Season 3/the final season of Prime Video's Hanna. I'm guessing his role in this film had to do with being cast in the show.I've read that loads of people thought Tyler beating up the kids was hilarious, and I don't get it. I guess I can understand why, but I was indifferent towards that scene. Maybe knowing about it before watching the film made me expect it was more violent.Talk about being expressionless. Amir Asif pretty much was poker-faced throughout the whole film. I guess you could attribute that to his cold-hearted nature. At the same time, it was a bit comical. All hell is breaking loose, and everything is going wrong for him, and he's still poker-faced.Geez. Talk about lengthy end credits. Once the film was over, I saw that there was still a chunk of space left to watch, so I watched it, assuming there was maybe a post-credits scene. Nope. Well, I wasted time doing that.",

The much-hyped scene that lasts over 10 minutes, goes from car chase to close combat and gunfights that wind in and out of flats, to people jumping from roof to roof, falling off a building, getting hit by a car, and ending in a big explosion. The entire scene was all-around crazy. The next-most-satisfying thing is seeing Rake slapping the hell out of a young, obnoxious gang of boys sent after him. Then, there's also the gorgeous Golshifteh Farahani, who blasts a helicopter down. Can we have a spin-off that focuses on her character? The Iranian actress plays Nik, who's Rake's controller, and also the only woman with a substantial role in the film. Extraction is very close to an all-male movie. With Farahani in it, it's like someone eventually realised that the film could use a badass female character, too.In the best moments, you can see Hemsworth and the stunt performers do their brutal hand-to-hand choreography in close quarters, but the camera is often so close to them that it's hard to get a clean look at the action. Impressive only on a technical level, the sequence drifts towards the uncanny valley of video game-dom, particularly in a lengthy car chase section involving a squad of police cars, aiming for gripping immediacy and missing the mark.The acting was good. Hemsworth was solid, Randeep Hooda was magnificently convincing, and the kid was good too. But, I was barely entertained by this film. Less would have been better, and more comprehensible.",

            "content": "ACTIONThe basic set up has young East Indian teenager, Ovi Mahajan (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) abducted in an exchanged for money. It happens that the teenager that was abducted happens to be the only son of a known drug cartel in India, his name also happens to be Ovi Mahajan except that he is a\"senior\" while his son is a \"junior\" in which the father is serving time in prison. And that when the son was kidnapped, that he was kidnapped by a rival gangster who lives in Dhaka, Bangladesh by the name of Amir Astif (Priyanshu Painyuli). Because Saju Rav (Randeep Hooda), Ovi's right hand man has a limited time limit into bringing him safely back as he has insufficient funds, that he needed to resort to him employing mercs, head by Nik Khan (Golshifteh Farahani) to do the job. And that is when Chris Hemsworth comes in, he plays Tyler Rake relaxing in Australia as he is informed by Nik Kahn that 14 year old Ovi Mahagan JR is the \"extraction\"- hence the title. And of course, not everything is going accordingly, as it was soon revealed that the guy who employed them Saju Rav also happens to be ex-special forces himself, as Amir of Dhaka has a stranglehold over the entire city including the police force and much of the army with odds totally stacked against the star Tyler, making the saving situation much more difficult which is nothing more but to serve as a backdrop to the many staged action sequences shown throughout.As I had said above, although \"Extraction\" would have been much enjoyed in the big screen it's still owned by Netflix. I mean, there's still a fair amount of people who do not have a Netflix account, like the homeless and the middle class who prefer to save a buck, some do not even have internet service. Therefore, Netflix will never know how much more money they would have made had \"Extraction\" gotten a proper theatrical screening, as opposed to Netflix using wasted time cracking down users who share their Netflix accounts. That the reason was so that they are able to finance more series and more movies, than I just have to say that their is another route, and that is to give them a proper theatrical release since they're other ways to see Netflix produced movies or TV shows than to have an account.",

            "content": "I didn't expect much from this movie. The Netflix tag still doesn't quite instill confidence despite their recent successful hits, and the action genre is one rife with hit and miss entries. I've already read quite a bit of feedback on this movie, and I feel like there's one key point they're all missing; this is a mindless action movie. Judging it on the merits of being a deep, thought-provoking character study is unfair. However judging it on the merits of being a balls-to-the-wall action flick, there's actually a lot here to redeem itself and set it apart from other attempts.Okay, there isn't much plot to Extraction. The entire story is summarised in the movie's title. Hemsworth plays a mercenary; Tyler, who's sent to Bangladesh in order to extract a drug-lord's son from the possession of a rival drug-lord. The entire city goes on lockdown and Tyler has to fight his way through henchmen and a corrupt police force in order to get out. There's some nice twists here and there from changing allegiances, and a few points of foreshadowing and plot payoffs, but there's nothing that requires you to really wrap your brain around it, and honestly that's okay. This isn't Inception. Truth be told Extraction has a lot more plot (from the aforementioned allegiance switches and payoffs) than I expected, so I feel like calling it mindless is a little baseless.Another thing about Extraction that plays against the dull and plot-less complaints is the character work. Again this isn't a full-on character study, and the background development we do get is a little clich\u00e9, but it's way more than your average run-of-the-mill action flick usually gets to enjoy. Tyler is a broken man after the death of his son and the breakdown of his marriage. He spends his days getting drunk and doing death-defying feats for fun. He has no more love of life. He doesn't get into the job because he cares about the kid or anyone involved. He just wants his money. But being haunted by the death of his son ends up making him more sympathetic to the fate of this kid, and as the movie goes on, the money means less to him. He just wants to get this kid out safe and alive.But Tyler isn't the only one that enjoys a hefty amount of personality. The movie also makes a bit to explore other more fringe characters, the most notable of which is Saju, the kids keeper after his father was incarcerated. With assets frozen, he can't afford to pay the mercenaries what he owes, so he tries to finish the job himself, against them. We get a look into his family life and his motivations behind his actions, and sit with him in the downtimes between action sequences. He becomes as much the lead character as Tyler does, earning respect and sympathy from the audience. You end up really rooting for this guy even as him and Tyler sparr off. We also get a small glimpse into the world of the antagonist drug-lord, showing us how despicable he really is by casually killing kids without a care, and brainwashing those left over to work for him. Extraction is brutal to its kids, but it plays to Tyler's predisposition and creates a much tighter and meaningful narrative than many give it credit for.But Extraction isn't about its plot or its characters, even though I feel those aspects are being unfairly criticised. Extraction is an action movie, directed by an ex-stuntman, starring muscled action stars from across the globe. In fact on that last point I particularly liked the movie's dedication to casting people roughly from the same area their character is meant to be from (or I guess vice versa; rewriting characters to fit the actor's background). Tyler is Australian, David Harbour plays a grizzled American on foreign soil, Nik is played by Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani, and while most the Bangladeshi characters are actually played by Indian actors, it's at least closer than most Hollywood casting. I particularly hope this opens up more Western opportunities for Randeep Hooda who played Saju, oozing charisma and cool without speaking a word, and effortlessly earning audience sympathies.But anyway, horrific tangent aside, Extraction is about its action sequences, and on that it certainly doesn't fail. This is another movie in the likes of John Wick and Atomic Blonde that prefers its action gritty and efficient. There's style here for sure, but it rarely breaks suspension of disbelief, and we see real consequences for all the hits these characters take. Tyler takes time bandaging his arm and putting it in a sling, Saju has to put his broken nose back into place, and David Harbour offers probably the most realistic reaction to being shot in the chest I've seen in a long time. There's no flying acrobatics, and no artistic flailing of limbs to make the choreography look pretty. It's brutal and efficient fighting, showing how exhausting it can all be. Ammo counts and reloading matters, getting punched in the face is different to being kicked in the gut, being run-over by a car hurts. And this is before mentioning the soon to be most-talked-about 12-minute long shot action scene that spans car chases, knife fights, gun fights, and apartment brawls, following multiple characters and different perspectives with seamless match-cuts to give the illusion of a neverending single shot.But the action isn't a complete winner, and there are reasons I'm apprehensive to label it as 'realistic'. Certain objects come out of nowhere for no reason just for excitement purposes, like high-speed cars heading down a dead-end. While there's no flying around, there are some cable stunts that are a little hard to swallow, like Tyler grabbing a kid by the leg and effortlessly throwing him into a car door. There's also a number of sniper moments that feel like they take too many liberties with how sniping works. Normally this would be pernickety even for me, but for a movie that wallows in it's accurate portrayal of gun fights, from injuries to the differentiation of sounds (pistols make more of a 'pah' sound, for instance), giving sniper superhuman abilities like seeing round corners and 100% accuracy just felt little lazy. In any other action movie I probably wouldn't have minded these slip-ups so much, but when the rest of it is all so tightly choreographed and mapped out, slipping up and breaking believability becomes so much more noticeable.In some regards, Extraction is just an average, run-of-the-mill action flick, and in others it's up there with some of the genre's modern greats. There are stakes, characters have emotional backbones even if they are a little clich\u00e9, there aren't any deeper themes, but the narrative is still tight and focussed, the action is more phenomenal than it is irksome, the cinematography is a little bland, the soundtrack can feel like a rip-off of better scores, but these kinds of motifs are iconic because they work so well. I find Extraction a hard one to judge because it feels greater than it has any right to be, while also hitting just shy of the mark. But generally I fall positive, so I give Extraction a respectable 7/10, and honestly I could see myself bumping it up with subsequent rewatches. There's a lot in this movie to like.",

One that's been reincarnated many times before but rarely as entertaining as this.\nThe Russo brothers of 'Avengers' fame produce with first time director Sam Hargrave at the helm.\nI say first time. Hargrave has directed several short films but this is his first feature film.\nA renowned stuntman and stunt coordinator. Hargraves has crafted a fine action movie with 'Extraction'. His expertise shine through with some of the best hand to hand combat scenes this side of 'John Wick'.\nThere's a beautifully shot car chase in which the camera stays in the car so we the audience feel like a passenger. There really is some marvellous direction of action here.\nThe film maybe basic but the fascinating camera work is certainly a cut above.\nAfter this I can see Hargrave's being in big demand.\nHe knows how to get the best out of his actors too.\nHemsworth is in full badass mode and sells every single punch.\nApart from his excellent performances as Thor, he's never been better.\nHemsworth has the talent, charisma and physic to follow in the footsteps of Sly and Arnie.\nThere's not too many genuine action stars anymore. Chris Hemsworth is totally believable onscreen and it's clear like Keanu Reeves he's doing most of the arse kicking himself and not relying on a trained martial artist or stuntman.Presented in Dolby Vision on Netflix, 'Extraction' is a visual treat.\nIt boasts a 4K crisp image.\nThere's absolutely no film grain which allows for a digitally crisp picture.\nDetail is very strong with sweat and grime visible in every pore. Close ups reveal every hair strand and blood soaked clothing as fine texture.\nThe movie has a amber coloured filter making the whole look of the movie feel hot, sweaty and gritty.If the visuals are good then we should have a great sound mix to accompany it right?\nWell rest assured that the Dolby Atmos mix that is available for those rocking a dedicated home theatre system is one of the best Netflix has to offer.\nThere's plenty going on up top with helicopters and bullets wizzing overhead.\nIn ceiling or height speakers will have to work hard.\nSurround sound effects are constant. Ambience or action, there's always something finding its way around the soundstage.\nLFE is rich and punchy.\nGunshots have a realistic thud whilst mid range sound is crisp as depleted shells bounce off the floor.\nMy only gripe with the sound mix is that the centre channel, particularly dialogue could become muddled from time to time causing me to raise my centre speaker by a few dB.\nAll in all this movie offers a fine surround sound experience.\nThe action scenes are demo worthy.\nThe film itself was a joyous surprise and one that those with a Netflix subscription should definitely check out.",

Most action films are based on the extraction of kidnapped family member or a precious item or heists of different types. Lovers of action films are going to love this film. The 10 year old son of an Indian drug lord ( Pankaj Tripathi) is kidnapped by a drug lord of Bangladesh, and taken there. Pankaj tells the boy's caretaker Randeep Huda to get the boy back or else.... On the other hand, a mercenary Chris Hemsworth is launched for a rescue mission keeping in mind the ransom money. The mission is launched and like all projects things don't go as per plan.\nThe film is full of car chases, car crashes, shootings, explosions, fistfights, sniping with dozens of policemen/ goons getting injured or falling dead. Our heroes/ villains have barely the time to reload. All credit to the director and his cinematographer for creating continuous, pulsating, edge of the seat action majorly with a hand held contantly fluid camera. The viewer has no option, and he/she is sucked into the action through the vibrant cinematography supplemented with rocking music. A word for the crisp editing which makes the film racy.There are some splendid aerial shots to heighten the impact. Never a dull moment.\nChris is at home doing all the action. He gets a chance to emote too as his character has a soft side. Randeep Huda does well. The actor playing the boy's role impresses.",

Except perhaps with slightly less 'badass empowered female' action, which was refreshing. There is a lot of violence, but it still felt watered down. It could have been way darker and edgier, which would have been more realistic too, but the main character was held back by the script.

Extraction does exactly what's it's supposed to do, and it does it perfectly. The action is so good that it actually holds the movie up when everything else holds it down. If the plot and characters where more compelling, then Extraction could've been one of the best action movies since John Wick.The plot follows a mentally scarred ex soldier merc who rescues the protagonist. Since this plot has been done too many times to count, it becomes nearly impossible to be just slightly unique. Extraction does one thing different, and that's the setting. It's unheard of that an action movie takes place in Bangladesh or anywhere near Bangladesh, but Extraction took the opportunity. Bangladesh is a hidden gem for settings because the possibilities are endless, and you can have some beautiful cinematography.When it comes to the action it's great until the last act for me because of how repetitive it becomes. By the time you reach the last act, you pretty much become desensitised to the action. If they slowed it down and had more dialogue, it would have been a breath of fresh air, and possibly be more emotional. Other than the repetitiveness, the action was really good. The character development and execution was good, although the cliche was to the max.This was Sam Hargrave's first big time directional debut, and it's a promising outing. Everything was shot well and the choreography was super impressive, and those few fight scenes where the most entertaining scenes in the movie. The editing was done masterfully too, as many action movies do a terrible job with showing all the action, but in Extraction, you witness everything.Overall, Extraction is a movie that is a definite watch if you're bored. Although Extraction does have issues, it doesn't really matter because this movie has one goal and that's to entertain you.",

I will say that the fight scene that I paused to type my thoughts so far is probably the best knife fight I can remember ever seeing in a movie so kudos for that. To bad they ended the way they did totally ruined that fight scene. Next oddity, why does this kid keep trusting Hemsworth? So we have in this story a typical troubled hero with something in his past that haunts him and drives him to make the choice that ultimately kills him but also makes him a hero. We have the innocent caught in a world he does not belong in and completely out of his element. We have the woman who loves the hero from afar and has never had the courage to act on her love. We have the trusted henchman that double crosses his boss only to be destroyed in the end. Finally we have the evil tyrants on both sides spreading hate and death for selfish reasons and greed in this case as often is the case two warring drug lords. 60 minutes, I am getting a bit bored of the same old same old. Oh my, the old friend, I just paused again, I am gonna guess that the old friend betrays him and tries to make an excuse about how he has to survive or they came to him and threatened his family or something like that. Watch it to see if I am right. 1:21 unforeseen twist, not completely unpredictable but I did not see it. Final thoughts; Randeep Hooda aka Saju is a fantastic action actor and I really enjoyed watching him in this movie and hope to find some others he is in that I can watch. Hemsworth does an admirable job of playing an operator or special forces or whatever you choose to call his past roll. We knew how the movie would end, however, that does not mean I or we should be happy about this, it was a bullstuff ending and frankly lost a star from me over the ending itself. (Yes I know this was based on someone else's work, a graphic novel, so what it is still bullstuff.)",

Also English is not my first language so I'd like to apologize about any of the possible mistakez, whoops, there's one! Joking.The fast-paced action scenes, the trembling camera work, alongside the exciting score, all excelled by giving me anxiety, extreme sensations and a huge portion of adrenalin.\nHence bravo to the director by delivering us maybe the best Action performance I've seen in a while! But the other problems just drag the movie down, unfortunately, and here they are:1. The story is just so poorly and full of clich\u00e9 that since the beggining I had this sensation of deja-vu. An ex-soldier, Tyler, who is now a mercenary, full of psychological burden, accepts any mission he receives, even though his life might be in danger. This one is an extraction of a Bengali kidnapped boy, Ovi, whose father is an imprisoned drug lord. Think you've seen this one already, don't you? And not to forget Tyler Rake, who literally kills a bad guy with a rake(and who in the name of God keeps a rake in his 7th floor apartment, oh, oh, I think I know this one!). Not to mention the other 150 bad guys he just smashes, and not one of them is smart enough to think of a smart plan to take him down. Nooo, sir! They were like: \"I think I really wanna get shot today, yeah.. Maybe even die, we'll see\".2. I'm pretty sure that there are also beautiful parts in the capital of Bangladesh, Dhaka, except from the penurious, miserable areas we are constantly shown. Where are my Bengali people, we stand by you guys!\nBut of course, we already got used to this poorly vision American producers have about Asian/African/ or even some European states. See also the bright side of life, dear Americans, as the Pythons would say!3. The Poor Character Development, a MAJOR PROBLEM FOR ME.\nWas I supposed to care about Saju(the South-Asian-Pablo-Escobar's right hand), who died to protect Ovi, and in the same time his family? Because I didnt't. At all! I simply didn't care when he died.\nThat Indian girl whose ancestors I'm 100% sure are the Amazons from mythological Greece. Also, didn't see her use in the story, just because she's so badass that she blows up a helicopter with an RPG, or because she is such an effective sniper, but not before Saju and our hero, Tyler, gets shot, I'm supposed to give her a big round of applause? Nope, I don't buy it, sorry!\nAnd our dear boy, Tyler. Gosh I love Chris Hemsworth. I keep waiting for the movie in which he will be able to show the world his acting skills. Surely this is not the one, but actually he did pretty well. But I didn't care about his missing wife, didn't care about his dead child, and obviously didn't care about the moment - which is supposed to give us some acknowledge about who they are as persons, it fails - he and Ovi have in Tyler's friend's house, Gaspar(i guess??), who, as a matter of fact, is ready to betray his dear friend(who saved his life in the past) for a bunch of dollars. And, you guessed, our professional mercenary, who not long ago in the movie, said that he only want his money, now is ready to save Ovi for nothing!(seen this one already, stop the cliches!!!!) they fight and at the last Ovi shoots him. Later on, that little boy has no remorse for shoting and killing a man.\nFor me, the death of Tyler only made me sigh by the love I care for Chris, and the melodramatic score(personal sensibility), but that's it. Not even the little kind of totem of underwater meditation Joe Russo gave us, that our hero is doing when we first met him, and wants to do it before he dies. Not only the last scene where Ovi is doing the same thing in a pool, and after he returns to the surface, we see in the backround a foggy appearence of Tyler, which gives us a little hope. Rub your eyes kid, you're deluding yourself.To finish this, overall this is a good action piece, really, even though it is sometimes a little improbable, but what isn't in this World. Sam Hargrave handled the alert rythm very healthy. Joe Russo, though, maybe it is better for him, and especially for us, to keep directing superheroes and leave the writing behind, for now.",

Hollywood needs to do some homework on that and not be eternally stuck in the Slumdog Millionaire time warp which in any case was lopsided and a big flop in INDIA.

The Russo brothers have written the story, and Joe Russo has lived screenplay. The film is based on the cartoon \"Ciudad\", written by Andy Parks.The film is known for its 11 minute long one-take, witch is made up of 36 different stitched sequences. Some of those sequences took 25 takes in order to line up correctly.It's an action-packed movie, but it's a bit of a shame that the first action scene is almost the best. This action scene is made with rubber weapons, as it was illegal to transport weapons that could shoot with light gunpowder into the country where the film was filmed. You can't see that in the finished film, so cardou for that.There is not much character development in the film. It's 100% show, with no significant history.The ending sequence on the bridge also causes the film problems, in terms of the sniper's ability to shoot and lack of the same.Chris Hemsworth is no doubt cut for action movies, but he is also good at comedy.

            "content": "This is a tightly run, minimally scripted action film, with a core plot point of a mercenary who develops an attachment to the principal target. Sure, we have seen this before.The amount of violence is very high, and the kill ratios are reminiscent more of a first person shooter than a real combat situation (the opponents always wait to fire, and patiently take head shots), but that is not in itself different from any other Western action flick. Those who remember Arnie mow down dozens in Commando without changing his clip will hardly find cause to complain.Bangladeshi viewers who find this movie's depiction of Bangla armed forces as corruptible have a cause to feel aggrieved. But seriously, after decades of Western cops shown as bent in cinema, it is fine if the reality of other countries makes its way into fiction? And principal photography was done in Western India, a vastly different visual space. It is not meant to be a realistic depiction of Dhaka. The traffic snarls and nearly impossible road situations are spot-on for Dhaka, as well as the people who stand and gawp at the action (speaking as a South Asian)..Chris Hemsworth keeps the emoting light and is effective in the role he essays here. Not much more was asked of him. He is believable as a man with a deathwish who wants to go out doing one last right thing. Strong international debut for Indian action star Randeep Hooda. I think he can expect more in the future. Not sure what the people asking for a plot really think they deserve, but the amount that there was - was sufficient for me.",

If its about Indian Drug Mafia's Lord you'll see an actual India with an Indian guy as Drug Lord communicating in Hindi, similarly when film goes to Bangladesh, you'll see real Bangladesh with Bangladeshi guy being Drug Lord there talking In Bengali. The film is the directorial debut of Sam Hargrave a Stuntman and Stunt coordinator known for choregraphing stunts in several Marvel Movies including Captain America: Civil War, Endgame, Thor: Ragnarok etc. which explains the fact that film is very mediocre in its storytelling and plot unfolding. In addition to that the film also never connects you emotionally during its emotional parts. Despite of that the film is a visual gem and gives you some visual experience as cinematography and Long action sequences are the strongest part of the movie which somehow despite of the flaws pulls this movie off to engage its audience. Talking about performances, Chris shines in all the action scenes as he should've and his presence is delightful to watch especially in cat and mouse sequences.However on the other hand Randeep Hooda looked little off colored may be due to the longer tiring action scenes for which he is not use to of, despite of the fact that he has fair amount of screen presence and is one of the leads which I definitely not expected. Tripathi as an Indian Drug Lord having just cameo appearance but he nailed it as he always does.\nSo if you're looking for some action then this movie is for you as you cannot skip this visual gem when it comes to action",

Nor is Extraction a spin-off from the highly-successful John Wick franchise, although if it is was, you wouldn't have thought twice. If anything, thinking twice is not why one would watch the Netflix original movie.Resplendent with turn-yer-brain-off action and in-yer-face fisticuffs, Extraction is the perfect prescription for fun escapism this quarantined world needs.Based on the graphic novel Ciudad by comicbook veteran Ande Parks (Capote in Kansas, Green Arrow) and Joe Russo (a screenwriter/director... somewhat of a newcomer in the field. Has a few little-seen, indie flicks on his resume...), Extraction is the straight-forward tale of a hardened-yet-weary merc hired to rescue a kidnapped boy. That boy, refreshingly played by Rudhraksh Jaiswal, whose wide, innocent eyes are more-than-reminiscent of Finn Wolfhard's Stranger Things teen exuberance, is the son of a ruthless Mumbai mobster. An equally-ruthless mobster, this one from Dhaka, Bangladesh, has the son kidnapped in order to finalize their gang war. Enter Chris Hemsworth and team whose muscles, grunts, and squinting eyes would make any paramilitary army quake in fear from their oncoming storm. In a fun little twist, once Hemsworth's team gains the child, they are brutally betrayed by the son's guardian, Saju, a former black ops solider, portrayed by action-star-in-the-making Randeep Hooda.Directed by Sam Hargrave, who worked as a stunt coordinator and second unit director on a number of Marvel movies, he follows in the footsteps of Chad Stahelski (John Wick) and David Leitch (Atomic Blonde). Showing more than hyper-stylized fight scenes, of which there are plenty, Hargrave beautifully choreographs an 11-minute, single-shot scene that even Sam Mendes (1917, Spectre) would find impressive.Hemsworth brings brunt physicality to the role as well as the requisite levels conflict. The twinkling Thunder God's eye has been replaced with a study of seriousness, which was a welcome turn following the depressing aloofness shown in his Endgame character. Most of all, Hemsworth is convincingly believable in a rather unbelievable role in a most ridiculous movie.Extraction has all the tropes of an 80s action movie. Of course, if Ovi was a blond woman there would have been the obligatory romance scene. Instead, there is the all-too short bromance between Hemsworth and David Harbour, whose affable charisma deserved longer screen time. Extraction is R-rated theater in single-minded pursuit of a single-minded goal: thoughtless entertainment. With that, Netflix has extracted a win.",

Also the action looks realistic enough and it feels like there is mostly no pause for some dramatic movements. But I must say the main characters are punshing bags who can also take bullets.I feel no connection with the main character, on the bridge I was thinking: and now they will shoot him... And yes there he goes! I did not care at all. The only thing we know is that he had a wife and his child died. And he drinks a lot of course. But I must say the acting is good, also from the other actors, but the main villain looks like a joke. Also the things he does is getting boring. Ok so he kills children, has weird demands and he is ordering around people. Why he wants to have the kid... Only humiliation right?And the action is getting boring quickly. It looks fantastic but after a while you are getting used to the falling of the bodies, the explosions, the 'they block everything but still we get out'.So it feels like a hommage of the 80/90s action movies. The kid at the end will get his revenge like he wanted... So I must give it a 5. I have seen way better, but also worse.

If you like action movies - this is a MUST see, if you like hemsworth he makes a solid but not aced performance when it comes to emotional depth but nails many of the actionsequences. Those where he misses and the martial arts koordination doesn't end up working are not in focus as the camerawork is good and the stuntmen are also mostly good which means it never really comes into focus either but lands in the periphery.The end become a little anticlimactic as it's more towards the clich\u00e9 direction (one being tying up loose ends).Regarding any other notes the cinematography that has been mentioned stands out for another reason, several notes has been lent from the Bourne series, at one point you're just waiting for the theme track to roll. Which detracts a little but also possibly open for a sequel (?). Which it should get, but I wouldn't put that one in connection with this movie but rather as a fully new plotline for the same characters.",

            "content": "First off, this is a good movie to kill two hours. Who doesn't love Chris Hemsworth? He's one of those guys men want to be and women want to be with. He has great screen presence and he just seems like a likeable guy,The movie has a ton of action and the fight scenes are at a John Wick-ish level for production, choreography and execution. The opening sequence where Hemsworth's character rescues the young boy and kills like a dozen men is filmed at close quarters, is very fast paced and is hilariously violent. The camera jumps around the scene so you get different angles.Hemsworth plays Tyler Rake, a depressed, burnt out former special forces soldier turned mercenary. He is hired to \"extract\" the 14-year old son (a very good Rudhraksh Jaiswal) of a imprisoned drug dealer from a rival drug dealer's clutches. The movie is set in India and the scenery is bleak, dirty and does not do India's reputation any favors. Once he rescues the boy, his team is ambushed and Tyler is left alone with the boy trying to navigate his way through the city to an extraction point. The father's right hand man, Saju, (an also very good Randeep Hooda) is likewise a former special forces soldier and he is tracking Tyler and the boy as well, holding his own personal motivations.David Harbor as an old friend with a safe house and Golshifteh Farahani as Tyler's handler Nik Khan are good in small roles. And that is the problem. The movie had some real potential to develop characters we care about, but it sacrifices 3D characters for action and violence. Tyler and Saju are two sides of the same coin, but that isn't explored very well other than a few quick scenes of their families. Nik is a bad ass supporting character, but her role is just yelling Tyler's name into a radio most of the time, until the end climax and epilogue. There is no sense of history between them...or between any of the characters. This movie had some pretty decent talent involved and it just felt wasted to make room for more action. When characters died, I didn't care because I had no emotional investment in these people.As I said the action scenes are superb. The scene of Tyler and Ovi racing through a rundown apartment complex chased by a slew of soldiers, police and gangsters is filmed in several very long takes and the camera is so close to the action you almost feel the punches. The fight that culminates this scene between Tyler and Saju is as good as anything in John Wick. Its a highlight of the film.A good movie that could have been great had it spent some more time on its characters. Still, I enjoyed it and look forward to Hemsworth's next project.",

The action is believable compared to some over the top Hollywood movies, probably has a lot to do with the overall budget.I'd say my biggest gripe is that the scenes that were finally calm, you could barely hear the conversation between Hemsworth and the kid.

You feel every gun shot has an impact and every knife wound actually does something to the person.The plot is simple. Get the kid extract him to safety from the bad guys nothing else to fluff the scenario with useless stuff.Really good old school action movie really. Straight to the point action flick.Usually these kind of movies are made cheap straight to DVD with bad actors and low budget and they hire a too old Bruce Willis to sell tickets and just end up bad but not this one they really wanted to do something good.

Add to the mix the rival crime lord in Dhaka, whose people originally kidnapped the boy but have lost him to Hemsworth and now will use all of their resources, including most of the bought and paid for police and military personnel on the payroll, to recover or kill the boy.This movie has great action sequences and cinematography going for it, but it needed a better sound editor, as many of the regional Indian dialects sound like mumbling to the western ear.

The.... let's called it a \"plot\"... is more of a mechanic to get Hemsworth to cross a large chunk of an Indian city on foot while straight killing any cops that might get in his way, but being nice enough to give any young kids a pass. So in this film the bad guys are people that kill one kid on screen, while the good guys are people that slaughter around 30-50 (could be higher) cops who may or may not have been \"dirty\". Take that, and the fact that the film could have been over in 30 minutes had Hemsworth's character not decided that growing a conscience involved taking the kid away from the person who was previously his handler. It kind of made the whole film feel like \"we could have used a native military character as the hero, but instead we wanted Thor to come in and save the day.\"If you're looking for nothing more than a film full of action, with very little down-time and even less plot, then this film is great.

Instead it focuses on what it also does best: The juicy action! Hemsworth is hands-on, he sure took quite some beating while making. His character is written well enough to feel believeable and his acting is on par. Same goes for Randeep Hooda, who is quite explosive as the antagonist.Most of the creativity and talent by the crew was spent in the first half and it shows. The camera work and the direction is simply amazing, the car chase scene left me puzzeling what was going on (in a good way). Sadly the creativity drops off quite going towards the ending, which is a little disappointing.

Don't get me wrong i grew up with action movie, my father is a hardcore action movie, Stallone, Van damme, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Jackie chan is my childhood memories, because of that i put my standard to watch Extraction very low. The only reason i watch this movie just because Chris Hemsworth is my favourite Avenger.Suprisingly this movie have a good cinematography, the director of photography have a good job shoot the scene for hollywood quality thumbs up. The second good things in this film is the choreography of hand to hand combat, it's very good they do it perfectly, i love every hand to hand combat in this movie.Yup that's the good thingThe very first thing i catch bad in this movie is the CGI, okay it's not so bad but it's caught the attention of me, maybe because this movie have a very good cinematography that makes the little bad CGI caught the eye. Second bad thing is the plot is too simple, so many forgotten character and so many oversimplifying story plot. I won't SPOIL the story, i just make a simple note of example like:1.Why the kid care so much to the main character? (it's like just a one day movie set and why he trust the main character more than his father right hand?)2.What's the important subplot of gangster kid Dhaka?3.David Harbour character background is contradicting with his act motives4.The ending is just duh5.Is this father and son movie? (you'll see many father and son scene in many character plot)Yeah i would say they have a lazy writing here, but in the end credit i see that this movie is based on Graphic Novel called Ciudad. so i dont know if this movie stay loyal to the Graphic Novel source or not, if it's not then probably it's lazy writing.The conclusion is Extraction it's a movie that have a good cinematography and one of a kind hand to hand fight scene, but this movie is not a martial art movie like The Raid so probably you'll find more shooting than fist, you'll also find noticeable CGI, cheesy ending, unanswered background story, and many why plot.What concern my mind is why the choose grown up actor for Ovi The Extraction kid character? They have a gangster kid group in the Dhaka who is more younger than Ovi the Extraction Kid !maybe if they change the kid character to more younger actor maybe it'll make me more sympathy to the film, yes like Logan movie.",

I loved the way the rescue portrayed Taylor, letting the audience see that beneath his tough exterior there was a fragile, sinful soul. For years has been to mentality to perform the task to death, until meet with the rescue of the hostage action, urgent rescue process and have dialogue with each other and their depth of moment, neither team attack and not received the payment and cancel the task, inner doubt leave Mr D leave, or face years of friend's betrayal, again in the middle of dilemma of whether to continue to protect the d struggle, not only let the audience deeply like Taylor on the role, also make the impressive rescue the whole movie, more opportunities can cause us to think.",

We already know that Hargrave is very competent when it comes to action, escpecially close combat and hand-to-hand fights, and it shows. Chris Hemsworth is physically brilliant, thanks to his director, and gives us a glimpse at how John Wick might have moved 15 years ago. The camerawork is quite impressive, the look of the film is a bit generic, but still beautiful to behold.Unfortunately, that's where it ends. The characters are shallow, the story almost non-existant and the acting... well, how good can it be? Hemsworth and his fellow co-actors actually try to make the most of the weak material given to them, but that material is very low-mileage indeed. Astonishingly generic backstory for a potentially great protagonist, no background for the antagonist, no interesting side characters. Given that, any emotional impact is sorely missed, even if the film repeatedly tries to make you feel something with cheesy flashbacks, meaningless sad music and other cheap tricks.This is a film with a starved skeleton of a plot, uninteresting characters and no reveals or plot twists at all. No surprises, no emotions, no impact. And even with the action being absolutely top-notch, it doesn't spark any real interest, at least not from my side. I even found myself a bit bored after the umpteenth time of Hemsworth doing cool moves, which leads to the inevitable conclusion that even the action falls short of fulfilling its objective: to thrill and make you root for the hero. Still, my verdict would have been a 3/10 if it wasn't for the excellent action.And so a question pops up: should every stunt coordinator and second unit director get to become a director? If he can also tell a story and has a vision, sure! Unfortunately, Sam Hargrave doesn't seem to fit that description and might be better off sticking to his guns.",

Overall it was predictable and used a bit too much \"plot-armor\" for my liking. BUT... I didn't go into this film expecting an amazing plot so I wasn't disappointed or felt like it took away from the overall experience. A solid 9 for its genre. Badass. Exciting. Violent.",

Story wise, I wouldn't say exactly original but it's not your Hollywood clich\u00e9 either. It's not a happy movie, you might want something more upbeat after it. I found a a little disappointing but still glad I watched, especially since it stars Chris Hemsworth, he's not even fat anymore :) one thing it seriously lacks is more women, but it's understandable why.",

First he goes in Rambo style, which is cool but if you're planning a mission up against 20 hostile, you need a squad. There is an ambiguous support character who seems battle hardened but his methods don't really add up. When you are senior military, you make sure you can win and you have the upper hand. But we see a lot of panic and escape here, not a cool controlled authority. It's a good movie but I think they should have ran it by a military consultant to make it more authentic.",

What caught my attention was the trailer of Extraction, that finally gave me hope to wait for a big action blockbuster. And having watched it on Netflix just minutes ago, I can assure you that it's the best action movie of the year till now. The film lived up to the hype and left me satisfied as the credits rolled.Extraction's USP is the action it offers: beautifully shot, neatly choreographed and well-edited too. Those fed up of quick cuts in recent action movies would be pleasantly surprised to find long takes in this film (in this case, a prolonged single-shot action sequence!) instead of fast cutting. The color tone is rich and suits the film's own tone. There are a couple of dramatic breaks between the action that make the viewers root for the characters.Chris Hemsworth delivers an impressive performance that gels with his character, while Rudraksh Jaiswal also presents us with a neat act. It's finally very satisfying to see Randeep Hooda doing a character like this. Make no mistake, he's done a couple of action films before but never did he play a tough character like this: one that allows him to both throw a punch and emote whenever needed.Extraction is also surprisingly realistic in terms of how it doesn't want to turn heroes into indestructible characters. When they get hit, they bleed. When they are injured, they feel pain. And given how all of this is done masterfully during its video-game style action, Extraction fulfills the action genre to its fullest. Again, since there's no way one's gonna step out and pay to buy tickets and popcorn to a movie at this moment, it's better to stay home, grab some snacks and prepare yourself for a thrill-a-minute, no-nonsense action ride called Extraction. Action aficionados are definitely in for a massive treat",

The action sequences are up there with the very best, the plot based on Ciudad has some palpable tense moments and Chris Hemsworth has done justice to the mercenary with a baggage role.Don't get influenced by the Bangladeshi people who have a problem with the accents or the shabby state shown of Dhaka. Trust me, I've been there, it's much worse. Also the accent is definitely not West Bengal, it's Bangladeshi for sure. It's just easy to raise questions on authenticity when you feel disappointed about the portrayal of your country, but kindly do not let it come in the way while enjoying a movie.The film juggles with the concept of internal conflicts, mercy killing, guilt nd walking the right path even if the odds are stacked against you, and does a good job of it. A great action flick, do give it a watch !",

            "content": "Being the directorial debut of stuntman/choreographer Sam Hargrave, 'Extraction' delivers on all its premises. For a film I was in moderate anticipation of, I must admit, I was heavily entertained.1. Written by Joe Russo, the plot involves mercenary Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) who is tasked with recusing Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the teenage son of an imprisoned Indian drug lord from a rival kingpin in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Whenever I watch action/thriller genres of film, I prefer simple plots and this does just that. The story never feels heavy-handed nor do the minor subplots ever disrupt the flow of the film itself. Each of the lead characters are given just enough backstory to where you feel for them by the time the suspenseful climax comes around.2. The film is ultimately Chris Hemworth's to carry and he doesn't disappoint. You completely buy him as an action star and this film is undoubtedly the most physically intense and realistic action I have seen him do. Unlike Sylvester Stallone or Dwayne Johnson who are rather generic action stars, Hemsworth proves himself as also being a very formidable dramatic actor as well just by the sheer emotion he puts into his deeper characters including this one. All credit to Sam Hargrave as I was completely floored by his direction of each fight scene and the manner in which they were staged.3. Unfortunately, as much as I want to praise this film, there are problems that need to be addressed. For some reason, the krytoninte of many action films are the generic villains and this one is no different. Priyanshu Painyuli plays the rival kingpin Amir who is responsible for the kidnapping, but he never has a formidable presence or seems like a legit threat in the overall story to where the film feels like there is no real antagonist. The same goes for Golshifteh Farahani (Nik) as her character is never fully developed either. The real dynamic is ultimately between Hemsworth and Jaiswal.4. Unlike the 'Fast & Furious' franchise, the action never becomes unbelievably unrealistic or buffoonish to where it lost me. In fact, despite there not being anything new action-wise, the realism and the way the cinematographer captures it all is what has you most compelled. Its been a long time since I've felt such intensity and fear for certain characters during a climax especially within an action film. I should warn that there is a certain level of gore that may make some viewers squeamish as this type of action doesn't shy away from the graphic nature in which people are killed.Had this film been released in theaters, I would have gladly paid to seen it on the big screen. I understand these types of releases are usually decisive among critics, but if you love R-Rated action, this is by far one of the more better ones in recent years. Much congratulations to Sam Hargrave because I honestly can't wait for his next directorial feature.",

Powerful performances and tight scripting take tired clich\u00e9s and make them feel like tried-and-true storytelling techniques. (Most of the time.) This could have been just a fun, disposable genre pasttime, but it's significantly better than that.Chris Hemsworth reveals himself to be a gifted craftsman through an understated, gripping performance. It's refreshingly un-self-conscious, and delivered humbly, without flash or fanfare. It's the mark of a smart director that he was given the space to do that. In those quiet moments, with his fierce, but anguished, weary eyes, he really made me believe his spiritual desolation. On reflection, it reminds me of Denzel Washington, who also elevates more than one action movie with hard-wrung pathos. I hope Hemsworth is allowed to continue on this track and do meatier work than he's been saddled with up to now.His isn't the only impressive performance. David Harbour is delightful in a thankless, but crucial bit part. What a presence that guy has. Rudhraksh Jaiswal shows up big time in that last act. Most kid actors aren't nearly that good. If there's any justice, he has a good career ahead of him, as does the startlingly adept first-time feature director Sam Hargrave. He doesn't quite sidestep all of the pitfalls of a movie like this (lots of side characters we don't have time to care about, some on-the-nose flashback material, etc.), but the way he choreographs motion, viscera, and heart is impressive.",

Yet it marks the beginning of an era where the stories of the capital of this small nation are being told by the Hollywood infrastructure to the whole world for the very first time on this scale. Events like these are important for Bangladesh and its filmmakers to create the urge in them to craft such stories on a massive scale for the global audience; stories which will be the accurate representations of the rich history, heritage and diversity of Dhaka.Except for the smartly handled production design choices, action packed fight sequences, and Hemsworth's Asgardian god like charms nothing else really works in the movie. The screenplay is poorly written and lacks emotion. Though this is a spoiler free review yet there is really nothing more to the story line. The film feels like a two hour long fight sequence with some bandage breaks like a PUBG match on your phone.We see a Bangladeshi drug lord kidnap an Indian crime lord's son and Tyler is unleashed to extract him from Dhaka. But why the big names of the subcontinental criminal underworld came to this rivalry, why these desperate measures are unclear.Another problematic thing is the portrayal of Bangladesh's law enforcement agencies. Every agency including the police, a fictional force named \"Elite\" which looked like Bangladesh's Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), and even the Bangladeshi military were portrayed to the worldwide audience that they were controlled and bribed by Dhaka based international drug cartels which is fictional but still problematic.It paints a picture to the world that Dhaka is like Medellin in Colombia during the Pablo Escobar era which is far from true.The screenplay could have supported some residents or law enforcement officers who were not criminals or involved in drug rings to balance this but every scene of Dhaka felt very wrongly portrayed.Then comes the main issue of the whole film, the Indian actors who played Bangladeshi roles. Not a single one of them was talking Bangla in a \"Dhakaite\" accent or even a Bangladeshi one. Some Indian actors were completely butchering the language and most Dhaka based characters in the film sounded like they had a West Bengal based accent and pronunciation. Bangladeshi netizens were quick to respond to this error and complained that the producers of the film did not give attention to the language at all and how no one in Dhaka speaks like the way these characters in this film do.The creators of the project should have kept in mind that Bangla language is the quintessential element of Bengali identity and they are the only nation who had given their lives for their mother tongue. So a faulty dialect of this language will become a sensitive issue for the Netflix users of this country.Another huge issue was the acting of the kidnapped kid Ovi, played by Indian actor Rudraksh Jaiswal. As one of the lead characters of the film and having a huge screen time his acting weakness bores the viewers. Most of his dialogue deliveries are typical Bollywood melodrama and in some scenes beside Hemsworth he seems redundant and ridiculous.",

Atleast they showed cop cars and strong police defence which doesn't exist in Dhaka haha.Coming down to the sepia (yellow) effect, try going out to USA or NZ and then back to Dhaka and the yellow effect will make some sense to you. Dhaka is covered in haze throughout summer where the sun rays get blended to haze. We don't notice it as we live in Dhaka. The movie has exaggerated it, I agree. But that's what Hollywood does with Kenya, South Africa and any warm country.Coming to the movie, y'all mad as it was not loaded with multiple complex segments to drive your head crazy. It was simply, and much straight to the point like a Bollywood movie. I liked this little movie. The action was amazing, visuals were realistic and it was way emotional near the end.All up, a nice movie. Lets not ask them to portray our city as something it isn't lmao.

They have mission they have to complete it we have to see whether they did or not if they then how so people who wants major plot twists and great story in action thriller movies then go and read story books or watch shawshank redemption type movies dont watch action thrillers. Mainly bangladeshi would have given low ratings because they feel offended about the plot as bangladesh is shown as a poor country with its full police and elite forece working under drug lord and in background there was bollywood songs . In that case you cant enjoy movies if you feel offending in such small things chill guys its movie and it always have antagonist part so welcome it with open heart not with hatred .Moreover good action movie for lockdown watch it",

            "content": "A mercenary, Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), with a troubled past accepts a contract to extract a mob bosses' son from the clutches of a rival mobster. With the odds stacked against him, Tyler finds his physical and mental resolve put to the test as the stakes become increasingly personal.A throwback to 80's style one-man-killing-machine action flicks that gave Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger their respective careers, Extraction's title also doubles as a pretty accurate synopsis of the film.Fronted by Hemsworth in another solid action leading man role, Extraction is a straight-shooting, no-nonsense ride that goes for the jugular when it comes to action. As Tyler travels through Dhaka, Bangladesh with the kidnapped kid in tow, he finds himself chased by crime lords, corrupt police officers and even child soldiers. The action is relentless and the film transitions from car chases to rooftop scuffles and street standoffs all within minutes of each other, making Extraction feel like it could have worked well as a single-take film had the filmmakers decided to take it up a notch.Naturally, comparisons to John Wick are inevitable, not least for being another feature debut for a stunt coordinator turned director. However, Extraction's endless onslaught of bloodshed ends up having the opposite effect of John Wick. Long before the film's protracted finale, the relentless shooting and killing becomes numbing rather than exhilarating, largely due to the exploitative nature of the story.Unlike the hyper-realism of John Wick, Extraction grounds itself in the gritty geo-political climate of a third world country (Thailand doubling for Bangladesh) and the grimy subtext of police corruption and organised crime is exploited for mind-numbing action carnage. It works on a basic thrill-level but leaves the film mired in questionable politics and a general air of callousness.That's why the Michael Bay school of switch off your brain to enjoy applies whole heartedly here. Extraction does not short-change viewers looking for a solid action flick to sink their teeth into, just don't expect to find much meat on its bones.",

            "content": "When John Wick snuck under the radar before blowing up on streaming services, it changed cinema in the way that Hardcore Harry showed the possibilities of POV. Keanu Reeves' character bobbed and wove through seamless action scenes littered with bodies and close quarter pistol techniques that were both brutal and poetic. Extraction brings the efficiency and intensity of battling for survival to the underworld of India in the hands of Chris Hemsworth's haunted mercenary- Tyler Rake.The character introductions are well handled, with Tyler's depression clearly signalling a painful past. Flashbacks are used to hint at the nature of this past, without fully becoming clear until the final act. Tyler is recruited to a mission that he says no other mercenary would touch, and this again signifies Tyler's broken state accepting a mission that is bound to go wrong. There is more characterization done on Tyler's counterpart, the man hired to protect the victim from the start, with a clearly defined motivation and predicament around the boy - Ovi, who is excellently played by Rudhraksh Jaiswal.\nWhat follows is an intense series of action scenes with few breaks for exposition before wrapping up in the final act.Where the story succeeds most is in the dynamic visuals and the scant dialogue is effective in furthering the plot while racking up a massive body count. Scenes move smoothly from running through the jungle, to a furious car chase, before the camera travels out a window into a building chase sprawling multiple rooms and floors before crashing from a balcony into the streets again. This gives little time for characters to emote beyond grunts of exertion and desperation. This leads to some of the films shortfalls, moral ambiguity and lack of vested interest.\nFar too little time is spent getting to know characters that their loss is hardly felt, while others undergo significant screen time that ends in tragic survival. This undermines the primary antagonist when subordinates demonstrate agency over their actions without consequences and often in ways that don't affect the narrative arc. A show down takes place, for example, between a background character that has had only a few short lines, while significant time is spent flushing out the unexplained thirst for violence in a young person who ultimately fails to contribute much to the plot at all. This leads to a moral ambiguity that is emphasized by a conversation between Tyler and an old friend - There are no good guys.Tyler demonstrates many admirable traits in the film, willing to stick with things to the bitter end, driven by something deep within him. He fights for what he thinks is right and does it well. He is however working for a drug lord to rescue his son from another drug lord. No matter where you point, there is no moral high ground, and there is legitimate concerns raised over the permanence of their actions, causing many questions to be left with simplistic or incomplete answers.The end result is a genuinely impressive action film, which benefits from a simple viewing. There are some deeper themes hinted at, not very well flushed out, but for sheer adrenaline and stylistic violence, it is a well done film. Chris Hemsworth and the other leads deliver on pretty well all fronts, and the production is very well done.",

It felt like Dhaka is a dark city where killing people is a normal thing on the street during daylight. Just like Mexico.2. In the movie, the director used kids to shoot gun fires. Using kids and representing them as the source of crime demeaned our reputation. I never expected that Dhaka will be presented so badly in our first collaboration with a Hollywood movie using kids. Are we so down to earth that we have to use kids for that? Okay, the director wanted to make it more realistic but I felt that he wanted to bring the ISIS vibe where we saw pictures of kids with guns.3. Why the Hell the Drug Lord of Dhaka cannot speak proper Bangla? They could have used our artists for that. I guess The Drug Lord of Dhaka was from India. It was depressing.",

I am a friend to movies. I'm rooting for them.\nOptimism aside, this Netflix original is one of the poorest written stories offered by the streaming site to-date. It's endlessly loaded firearms, and the hero's penchant for the double-tap coup de gr\u00e2ce fighting style becomes lazy after a while. I have heard review that liken it to a John Wick-style, ultra-violent, revenge fantasy. The difference between the movies' approach to killing, however, could not be more different. John Wick lives in a dream-like word of paid assassins, where Extraction exists in a gritty, morally bankrupt reality. The story has very little, humor or heart. At last count, Chris Hemsworth's character kills 183 people. John Wick's body count is notoriously high as well, however, Wick's killing has context. He is getting his revenge. Extraction holds no such justification. In order to save one boy, there are hundreds of deaths. Where John Wick kills bad guys. Extraction, in stark contrast, kills police officers and military troops. Almost 200 kills for the life of one drug trafficker's son. I just don't buy it!",

The (by the way stunning) female lead looked far too glamourous in combat and Chris was too superhuman at times when you consider the (relatively) realistic setting. So maybe the sequel needs to be more realistic or more over the top. But overall I found it very entertaining, especially for a Netflix-original.",

You don't learn much about them and when they're being sad or determined, the viewer hasn't been put in a position to empathize with them.\nChris Hemsworth was a decent enough actor for a 'merc' but the part needed a lot more fleshing out in the script to make his character have more prestige. In other words, he needed a (better) backstory, a clearer motive and a personality!The narrative felt like it was pasting tropes from other movies it had copied from.

The violence was senseless. all act of violence are senseless of course but in this case much more so. I can't say much without spoilers but the story had zero depth.

Rake is able to do so, with a lot of bloodshed but then he is double-crossed by Saju Rav (Randeep Hooda), an operative working for Mahajan. There's no money to pay Rake and his team, so the idea was to take Ovi Jr. Away from Rake and take him home. But, then, the gangster that kidnapped Ovi, Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli) sends his army of soldiers and criminals, including some youths, to recover the boy. Saju and Rake have to work together to save Ovi.The action in this movie is non-stop and well orchestrated. There's lots of gun play, hand to hand combat, armed and unarmed, and vehicular destruction. It's all very well done. But, there maybe too much of it. Because of that, it starts to become less interesting. Although I loved the intense adrenaline of it at first, it lost credibility for me when Sanjay survived being hit hard by a big bus. It just wasn't believable after that.Hemsworth does a solid job of leading the movie. He is impressive in his stunts and his acting. There was largely some pretty good acting all around.

There are so many things wrong with this movie, I understand there is a need for suspension of belief. 1st the father who fails to protect his son. 2nd the boat crew that is so poorly trained they get killed, 3rd the sniper gets killed, then the lead character goes to someone who OF COURSE betrays him, I was a little surprised that the kid killed him so 1 star for that, the amount of police and soldiers that are killed and no one in the local government could be bothered to ask what is going on. The people just lining up with no protests, Then the lead getting killed by the other kid on the bridge, because his team lead decides to break training? But wait he might not have died but his team leaves him behind, So many holes, The good thing is this was not released to the theaters, So I didn't waste any money on it.",

But the fact is that, the army is indeed incompetent and highly corrupt. The plot doesn't take place within the city but on the outskirts, this literally proves the fact that they haven't watched the movie. The people putting in bad reviews should be ashamed of themselves, it's so easy to put in bad reviews. If you'll go through the reviews you'll easily know that most of them are just hate reviews without any legit reason. I made an account just to come in support for the people who have made this project a reality.The movie is a Gem, one of the best action films of the decade. I cannot believe this was out for Netflix, it truly deserves a big if not a huge screen. The first half of the movie is non-stop, literally breathless action. The hand to hand combat scenes were on par with the RAID films! I never thought I'd say this, atleast not so soon. They've pushed the limits as much as they could. The car chases in the outskirts of the city were shot extremely seamlessly and choreographed with unbelievable precision. The vfx and sound design is astoundingly neat and crisp, again wasn't really expecting it to be so damn good. The muzzle flares and gun shot effects were on point and as realistic as they could get. The editing is so clean you'll never know the transitions between the takes.\nSam Hargrave, the director, is truly a master of his craft. He knew exactly what he was doing. There's a long extended action scene or a (Oner) which I don't want to spoil for anyone, it's probably the best one-take action sequences I've witnessed in a long time. You think John Wick and Atomic Blonde had cool slick action, wait till you watch this movie. There's some meaty stuff in here for Action nerds and the kind of gun-fu I haven't seen before. You will never be able to anticipate the moves. The stunt choreography was so meticulously and precisely designed, I cannot fathom the level of expertise it would have taken for them to have practised the whole sequence, to remember every move and have executed them in such a precise manner, is so f**king impressive. This is some premium stuff right here. Chris has done all the stunts and combat scenes by himself which is highly commendable. There's a lot of hard work that's gone behind this project and it is clearly visible. Indian actor Randeep Hooda has also done a commendable job especially during the action sequences and that one ridiculously stunning knife fight.\nLoved Hemsworth's emotional performance as well, he's a big mean beast with a soft heart and it shows. With this movie Chris Hemsworth can well and truly join the big leagues of pure action movie stars. Not that he wasn't one before, but the stuff he's done in this film is particularly spectacular. I cannot wait for a sequel or even another project from Hargrave. He had my curiosity, but now he's definitely got my attention. There should be more support in favour of projects such as these. I think this is by far the best Action original from Netflix. Do yourself a favour by not missing it. What else are you doing in the lockdown anyway? Totally worth a re-watch.",

            "content": "With the exception of the insightfully taken care of creation plan decisions, activity stuffed battle successions, and Hemsworth's Asgardian god like charms nothing else truly works in the film. The screenplay is inadequately composed and needs feeling. In spite of the fact that this is a spoiler free audit yet there is actually nothing more to the story line. The film feels like a two hour long battle grouping with some gauze breaks like a PUBG coordinate on your telephone.We see a Bangladeshi medication master grab an Indian wrongdoing ruler's child and Tyler is released to extricate him from Dhaka. Yet, why the enormous names of the subcontinental criminal black market resulted in these present circumstances competition, why these edgy measures are indistinct.Another tricky thing is the depiction of Bangladesh's law authorization organizations. Each office including the police, an anecdotal power named \"Tip top\" which resembled Bangladesh's Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), and even the Bangladeshi military were depicted to the overall crowd that they were controlled and paid off by Dhaka based universal medication cartels which is anecdotal yet at the same time dangerous.It paints an image to the world that Dhaka resembles Medellin in Colombia during the Pablo Escobar period which is a long way from valid.The screenplay could have upheld a few occupants or law requirement officials who were not hoodlums or associated with medicate rings to adjust this yet every scene of Dhaka felt wrongly depicted.At that point comes the primary issue of the entire film, the Indian entertainers who assumed Bangladeshi jobs. Not a solitary one of them was talking Bangla in a \"Dhakaite\" highlight or even a Bangladeshi one. Some Indian on-screen characters were totally butchering the language and most Dhaka based characters in the film seemed like they had a West Bengal based complement and articulation. Bangladeshi netizens rushed to react to this blunder and grumbled that the makers of the film didn't focus on the language at all and how nobody in Dhaka talks like the manner in which these characters in this film do.The makers of the task ought to have remembered that Bangla language is the quintessential component of Bengali character and they are the main country who had given their lives for their native language. So a broken tongue of this language will turn into a delicate issue for the Netflix clients of this nation.Another colossal issue was the acting of the abducted kid Ovi, played by Indian on-screen character Rudraksh Jaiswal. As one of the lead characters of the film and having a gigantic screen time his acting shortcoming exhausts the watchers. A large portion of his exchange conveyances are common Bollywood acting and in certain scenes close to Hemsworth he appears to be repetitive and crazy.",

In retrospect, and seeing Hemsworth had produced it, to me he is obviously a product of having grown up playing very violent video games. The graphic violence in this movie may be shocking to older viewers, but I can't help but think, considering what kids play online or on those at home game contraptions today, the movie won't register as horrifyingly violent for them as it did me.

Used everything at his disposal and its shot in a similar 1917 style one shot during certain action scenes which really set the bar and the gore left me watching the screen cringing as made me feel there pain.This film would of been a 10 if the story was better but for an easy Friday night action film it's a treat.

            "content": "So the movie starts and we see Tyler Rake (played by Chris Hemsworth) decked out in tactical vest, looking very badly injured, on a bridge. As he slumps behind a vehicle with shots being fired around him, his mind goes back, we see a blurred vision, of what looks like a little child on a beach. The story then cuts from that scene and goes back to explain, how and why Tyler is in this condition.\nWe see a teenage Indian boy, Ovi Mahajan (played by Rudhraksh Jaiswal) with his friends. He looks like your average teenager, hanging out with his friends. You can see that he is of a wealthy family. He sneaks out of his home to meet his friends at a club,While out one boy he is with gets shot and a hood is placed over Ovi's head.\nWe then find out that this is a kidnapping. Ovi's father a Mumbai crime lord, serving time in prison, but he main rival Amir Asif (played by Priyanshu Painyuli) has orchestrated it all and will use Ovi as a pawn to get what he wants. Amir runs the underworld of weapons, drugs and trafficking in Bangladesh. So where does Tyler Rake feature? The next scenes show Tyler being commandeered and offered the mission of the \"extraction\" of Ovi. You see Tyler is a black market mercenary. The mission is offered to him by Nik Khan (played by Golshifteh Farahani), who is also a mercenary. She describes the mission to Tyler as, the most deadly \"extraction\" of his career. Does he get to Ovi?\nThis movie was OK, to be honest i expected a little more. Its A Chris Hemsworth Action Thriller! Don't get me wrong, the movie is full of action and is a thriller, but seemed to be missing something. Car chases, gun fights, knife fights, you got it, the story-line was feasible too. I don't know? Do i now expect amazing films from Chris Hemsworth? Am i expecting too much? I don't think i am! He has come to be known as a very good actor and in Netflix high budget movie, i wasn't as blown away as i think I should have been, especially as its screen-writer was veteran Marvel Comic guru, Joe Russo.\nStill worth a watch for you car chasing, gun wielding action fans.",

Rake and Khan's team prepare to extract Ovi, with his father's men set to pay them once Ovi is recovered. Is Tyler successful? What all enemies he has to fight to bring back Ovi and do both make it back successfully is what the story covers.\nThere are some impressive stunt work and fantastically steroidal action sequences by both Chris Hemsworth ,Randeep Hooda(Saju) and even Golshifteh Farahani towards the end. Golshifteh as Nik looks beautiful. Randeep and Chris have some great moments of guns blazing and combat knives stabbing.with each other and against Asif's man. As action takes the centrestage the story goes for a toss as case is with most of the action series. Many would call is mindless. The movie does get tedious after an hour but quickly finds its feet once Ovi(14 yr old) kills the Gasper(David Harbour ). Yes, 14 yr old has moments as well. And, bond between the Ovi and his saviour Tyler do carry emotion so Tyler going all out for Ovi does make sense.\nThough I would have loved to see backstory of Ovi Mahajan Sr(Pankaj Tripathi) and Amir Asif(Priyanshu Painyuli) for me to be fully invested into the series. Such detailing was absent and many a times you could wonder if all the bloodbath is all worth it.\nAll in all, for action movie fans, it is a must watch.",

            "content": "Russo Brothers in this day and age can't seem to do no wrong with their style of action that comes off the heels of several blockbuster Marvel franchises in the likes of Captain America, and Avengers. And what a way to woo one of the biggest names of those franchises to a project that pits a covert mercenary against a kingpin in a battle for the life a child in the dirty filthy streets of India. What else can you expect? Well... A lot, and I say it does that for most of the film.Chris Hemsworth plays Tyler Rake, a mercenary hired to extract a kid named \"Ovi\", played by Rudhraksh Jaiswal, to the border before his father sends trained killers to hunt him down and anyone who helps him. The twist of one of these hunters sent after him, Saju, played by Randeep Hooda is a sympathetic father forced into action for the sake of his family's safety, creating tension between Hemsworth and Hooda's characters that leads to one of the greatest action scenes I've ever seen filmed on camera. In a one take 15+ minute scene where Rake and the kid go through car chase, foot chase, gun fight, and ends with hand-to-hand fighting is jaw dropping and very fitting of the Russo's style. The grit and grind are deep in this one, and it never leaves from the start to the end. Nik Khan played by Golshifteh Farahani is introduced as the director of the operation and she plays the bad ass chick that you don't normally see from these kinds of women in those regions. Golshifteh was also very genuine in her performance that was very similar to her role in Body of Lies with co-star Leo Dicaprio, and she commands her presence in a way that was never forced or overbearing but stern and caring for both Hemsworth and Rudhraksh's characters. Chris plays his part to the \"T\" and when he gets prepared for the role, he puts effort where it matters that could possibly range in weapons, physique, and martial arts training and I appreciate it more than anything when an actor takes a role like this seriously especially one that requires physical action to point of believability and he delivers with passing colors. But that's not all of his performance that can be said he delivered. His performance as Tyler Rake, a man living on the edge and almost suicidal can go really wrong if Hemsworth doesn't buy the vulnerability of his character, and putting aside the hero of Thor, and replacing it with a darker more greyish hero could of went completely wrong for him, but he plays it well from his opening scene to his end. And I grew a deeper appreciation for Hemsworth as a solid actor because of it. The surprise of the film for me was Randeep Hooda. His character along with performance was interesting to watch, and I'm curious now to see if he was or will be in any more action style films of this genre. Only time will tell I suppose.I enjoyed the film. It had Russo style action, interesting themes and archetypes. And mostly it had some solid performances from its cast that got me excited for the sequel. It's worth checking out, even if you don't like violence.8/10.",

Hemsworth and Hooda mow their way through literally scores of regular police officers. Sure, the Dhaka police is shown as corrupt, taking orders from a mafiosi, but they are not *all* corrupt, right? At least some of them are just there to do their job, protecting the civil order of Dhaka, trying to take down two psychopathic killers and their paramilitary friends. Even in a not-so-black-and-white world, they are clearly not the bad guys. And yet, the movie expects me to feel pity for those two psychopaths instead? That bugged the hell out of me and really took me out of the movie. Especially towards the end. Tyler Rake is *no* hero.Seriously. Next time, if you're going for a mindless, bloody action flic with a body count in the hundreds, you got to make a better choice of who is gunned down by your heroes. Make them criminals, aliens, orcs, nazis, or some other comically evil army of soldiers who attack sovereign neighboring countries and murder innocent civilians.

The 11+ minute tracking scene is exciting, even for those who aren't film nerds. Hargrave clearly had a vision for how he wanted this film to look and handled some huge action set pieces with extreme precision. This film definitely borrowed heavily from the John Wick series, and to a lesser extent The Raid. It wasn't quite as good as either, but with the right expectations this is a highly enjoyable, fast paced film. Sure, the plot is fairly thin with a handful of thinly developed side characters, but that's ok since everything else was done pretty dang well. Could this be a franchise for Chris Hemsworth?

Certainly not the best in the genre but then it sure is one time watch.In these elongated single shot sequence movies or in action movies in general, the story always goes for toss, I still don't understand the point of fast and furious but they are enjoyable. Exceptions would be Bourne series which has a lot more gripping tale to tell although action is the main focus. This movie story assessment falls in between. The plot is not the high point.The high point are the action sequences. There is a floating sense of bourne series, a touch of 'the raid' specially the fights within buildings. some of the gun shooting are slick.Chris Hemsworth in my opinion overshadows others mostly by his strong physical appearance, Other mention would be Randeep Hooda, he had his presence marked, all others did what they are supposed to do, no stellar performances.Now few words about misrepresentation of Dhaka, I feel movie as a form in itself is a misrepresentation, If you want a true representation look for a Documentary. Slumdog millionaire won Oscar though people were pissed off because it misrepresented Mumbai (Bombay). Here is the thing, When you are making a commercial movie, You look for bare minimum and you stroke the preconceived notions of people. They highlight the things which fascinates people, I personally didn't like the overuse of chromatic lighting to make street looks dirtier. But then I feel you are not doing yourself a favor by being offended.All in all it's a one time watch with good action sequences and it's always pleasing to watch Chris Hemsworth who also produced the movie.",

Dhaka is a megacity, its not a beautiful city but It's not a slum at all. They didn't shoot the movie in Dhaka so nothing match its actual environment. Their accents didn't match and Indian music in every home and child with shotguns also very unfamiliar in Dhaka.

Thats was the entire plot though. The story becomes secondary while making the action primary and,they did achieve what they intended. For starters, Chris Hemsworth was good in this, he did have a really good charisma in this and he was the only one to get a bit of additional character detailing. Ovi Mahajan(Jaiswal), the plot device, had less characterisation but, was likable and had more emotional attachment towards the end. Nik Khan(Farahani) and Saju(Hooda) were also good although they were one dimensional. David Harbour had a small cameo which was actually good. The villain was bland.\nSpeaking about the other aspects,the movie did have pretty good action sequences. The long fight sequence in the first half of the movie is my favorite. They utilized the 'R' rating properly. The violence was extreme at certain times, unlike in Deadpool which seemed comical,this was more realistic and brutal. The movie was made by a stuntman and he did ensure really good action sequences. There were really good camera movements in this and choreography was good. The music was apt for this. The biggest con of this movie which I felt was that this whole movie felt like a video game. First we had a bit of character interactions,then fights, slowing down to interactions and continuing. This was still a watchable movie, guilty pleasure to be precise.\nI recommend this movie to every action lovers, Hemsworth fans and to everyone who needs some adrenaline during quarantine.Rating: 7/10",

This is not to say action is the only thing it provides, the story isn't non existent, it's just hidden. They don't go off on dialoge giving backstory, they convey it through the actions of characters and emotion. The context of the storyline is admittedly abit lacking but i think and hope they will cover this in a later release. A second movie is already in production. The story is a tool to create a satisfactory experience paired with the action. With this insight i believe the existing story is more than sufficient while also makeing one long for more.This movie is not ment to be a representation of the modern world, it's a fictional world that exists to convey the film. So judging the quality of the movie upon what music they listen to in one building in Bangladesh is irrelevant. Misrepresenting details about Bangladesh is not important when you have the entire Bengali police force helping the biggest druglord in their country kill an Australian man trying to save a teenager. Talk about realistic. Just beacuse a movie isn't classed as sci-fi dosn't mean you should expect a documentary. The \"based on real life\" trope is played out, we need more creative film expression like this.90% of the people condemning this movie are either Bengali who were expecting seeing their uncle herding animals or people who didn't follow the story. If i wanted entertaining drama I'd have read a book instead or watched reality TV. Personally there's enough drama in my real life already, so much so that i might want to watch a satisfying action movie as an outlet and distraction from todays world events. Oh wait i already did that when i watched this movie.If the sequal gives that contextual sadisfaction this would be a strong 10, For now it's a great set up for that, sitting at a 9.5.",

Unfortunately, the film's flaws drag it down, resulting in its forgetfulness and averageness.\nNow, the film nails the emotional bits. These characters are likable just from the start of the film, thanks to the writers establishing our connection with them using a few effective scenes, and doubled with great performances from the actors, an array of great protagonists are created.\nUnfortunately, the script fails in terms of originality, as the story follows familiar beats as other films, therefore diminishing the element of surprise. The film's side characters are often underdeveloped and underused, for example, Jake Tyler's boss. She gets more crucial to the story as it goes on, but it feels like the writers aren't interested in fleshing her out, as we get glimpses of her past, her relationship with the main protagonist, and more so, but these traits are ignored, leaving a caricature of a character.\nAlso, the action gets stale quite soon as it doesn't change throughout the whole film.\nFinally, this film could be so much better, if it could focus more on either the characters or the action, instead of attempting to do both.",

I always thought John wick is the most polished action cinema Hollywood ever created but the russos took the challenge and with stunt coordinator turned director Sam hargrave delivered another flawless action film where every broken bones can be heard and feel, the unbroken 12 minute tracking is the highlight of the film reminded me of raid 2 but this scene has its own ruggedness and grit. So coming to the story it is nothing new there is zero sense of character development In this film, the character dynamics between the two main leads are undercooked and the misunderstanding of both the hero and the anti hero Randeep Hooda fantastic performance, are somewhat litle half backed. The predictable plot beats will remind you of Leon the professional and many other films but the dissaopointing script makes up for the terrific acting the cast offers. Randeep Hooda nails his ability to create a believable mercenary from India his acting style is no doubt extraordinary but the way he performed the action scenes feels like he is the action movie star of the world extremely authentic and his character beat is very emotional proud that an Indian actor deserved his talent in the wider Hollywood spectrum. And the lead character Chrish Hemsworth is again brilliant this guy with a hulking physique can emote so brilliantly is a testament to his talents he really is mastering his emotionally charged scenes right from the Endgame. The supporting cast ably did justice to the film and one more thing the wild card of the movie golshifteh farahani stole the show at the climax and the third act she really saved the guys bravo subtle performance from her very intense her role was small but she really made an impression in this film.

It was all about developing a profitable product for a broader consumer market. Casting two established Bollywood actors (at lower wage), paying for hindi music bits, faking Kolkata locations and ambience as Dhaka and casting Thor himself was to bag in the greater usual netflix crowd from India. Putting the name Dhaka and just showing freelance drone-shots of the city and shamelessly fooling around with inappropriate accent, language, culture and ambience along with lack of any Bangladeshi actor still brings in Bangladeshi viewers. Engaging a reputed line producer from Bangladesh and well portraying the country was not a big deal but I guess Netflix cautiously ignored it.Hence, Netflix will certainly recover the investment with full profit.

            "content": "Back to the 90's we go in this highly forgettable action flick that obeys every cliche and adds exactly nothing to the genre. Brooding tough guy? Check. With a layer of scars and calluses from countless unnamed wars? Check. That are hiding a the soft centre of a genuinely good man? Also check. Right, let's have a quick flashback to hint at his tragic backstory and explain why he's so broken and self destructive. Done. And give him one last mission - a rescue, someone vulnerable that reminds him of his tragic loss. The list of action tropes goes on and on - right down to the pretty lady, the hint of new beginnings, of a relationship that can happen once the hero's dealt with his demons. *slaps forehead and sighs* There's just no reason for this thing to exist - other than to prove Hemsworth can do more than Thor. Which he probably can, but this does little for his case. The plot is purille; Rescue drug dealer's kid, oh no, we've been double-crossed (imagine that) but we'll carry on despite the fact he's nothing to us because it's the right thing to do. Even if that means killing hundreds of police with families who are just doing their jobs, a whole lot of innocent bystanders, truck loads of bad guys and a few highly trained professional mercenaries. This makes not a lick of sense considering at one point the mercenaries actually say they couldn't keep the kid safe even if they could pull off the rescue. This is glossed over at the end. The characters are flat and predictable. We know the bad guys are bad because, like Bond villains, they just stand around throwing kids off buildings and doing evil stuff. A lot has been said about the action but really, it's just OK. It's mostly down to shaky camera work making everything seem faster and more frenetic. The location is the film's one interesting point. And also the source of some of the problems with the action. There's a few chase scenes that anyone who's tried to drive in India would know are impossible. Pedestrians etc jump out of the way like in a bad computer game. And in one scene a speeding vehicle comes out of absolutely nowhere to hit poor Chris. Despite the fact we've just see that all the narrow streets are blocked. Inconvenient. But don't worry, we'll just take this truck that's conveniently appeared - from the same narrow alleyways that we've just seen to be jam-packed with people and overturned stalls and carts and whatnot. And drive off at speed. The simplistic plot goes from dumb to dumber as we head towards the inevitable showdown on the bridge we caught a glimpse of at the beginning. It's the typical 'we have to get from A to B' scenario via the hardest way possible ignoring any possible alternatives. \"The police have all the bridges blocked? And for some obscure reason you can't get a chopper to us until we get to the other side?! Umm, what about a boat?\" \"Shhhh. You're spoiling it.\" This is anachronistic, dated, dumb action that simply shouldn't be. After watching 6 Underground which felt fresh and interesting (for a popcorn action movie), you have to wonder why Netflix greenlit such a backward leap for the genre.",

The movie feels like a video game where the viewer is taken through one action-packed scene to the next all while the human element of the characters is left woefully unexplored.The art of action movie making seems to have shifted more to elaborate stunt and special effect extravaganza, while ignoring the more intimate and quite moments needed for the characters to become likeable enough for you to care for them. Comparing modern action movies to the offerings from the 70-90's era, it becomes all too evident to me that this genre has seen a noticeable decline in quality over the years and extraction is a painful reminder of this.",

The movie receives a 0 from me in other areas. If you watch enough movies the plot becomes so obvious within 15 minutes into the movie. There's nothing new to the storyline, the same 'military man- haunted past-lost family' stuff recycled in Hollywood over and over again. It'll certainly be entertaining for casual audience especially the younger generation. But there's nothing in the movie apart from the visuals. I'd even say the plot is worse than expected. Motivation for the kidnapping doesn't make any kind of sense at all. Money? Come on, seriously?\nAnd then there's the plot armor, main character vs main character drama etc",

            "content": "The plot is quit familiar: Mr. Special-skills-ex-military-tragic-backstory is hired to save powerful person's loved one from rival powerful person who has kidnapped said loved one. Connection to powerful person's loved one becomes personal as both parties survive together. Also, important person's loved one comes to somehow remind Mr. Special-skills of the loved ones he's lost and he decides this mission is worth risking his life.I wasn't bored by any means and there are a few twists thrown in here and there that will probably keep you watching till the end.The ending was perfectly satisfactory in my opinion until the directors/writers or whoever is in charge of such decisions just couldn't bare to have Mr. Special-skills be actually, truly, unambiguously dead. He gets shot and falls in the river so you really do feel the weight of his sacrifice but of course there's no body and we see a familiar silhouette in the background of the final scene so the 'sacrifice' turns out to be no sacrifice at all. Can't traumatize the audience with the death of a Hemsworth and kill off any possibility of a sequel, can we?The assassination of the rival drug lord is both satisfying and frustrating. Satisfying in that we finally see this cruel man get what he deserves and frustrating in that it might, in my opinion, have been more interesting to have him survive and get away with it, making it so the conversations about how Ovi will never truly know peace actually mean something since his father's rival is still alive somewhere waiting in the shadows.It's fine. It's an ok movie. It has enough action to be enjoyable and the characters are somewhat interesting. Bonus points for not shoving fifteen minute flashbacks of Tyler's past in our faces.",

In one-liner \"it's good for action lover and worth watching but can be spared\". It remains a one-man show from beginning to end. What I noticed a tactical plan of rescue is missed, insignificant sequences which are not must.Plot Overview:The movie revolves around the kidnapping of boy(Ovi), an Indian drug lord's son and how he is extracted from Bangladesh by Tyler (Chris Hemsworth). Most of the scenes are filmed into crowded streets of Dhaka and comes out natural throughout the movie.Action:The action sequence is good and shot beautifully, don't know the technology but it feels you are in a game. Chase scenes are eye-catching, especially the tussle between Chris and Randip Hooda is a treat to watch. Both Chris and Randip did justice to their roles and executed actions perfectly and it seems real. However, some scenes from the army look incompetent, how come a country which is kept under complete lockdown not able to hunt a single person. Personally, I can't believe.Performance:Main screen time is taken by Chris and Randip, both did justice and acted in the character. Rudraksh portrayed the son's role elegantly. The Indian drug lord played by Pankaj Tripati but he hardly got 2 minutes on screen and Priyanshu Painyuli, Bangladesh's drug lord make a significant impact but he also doesn't have anything to do.",

Character development is poor as I didn't feel too attached to any of them but that's fine, the film knows it's a gritty action packed film and keeps to that, the character development as I said is poor but is there to help you try and rout for them to survive. Most Netflix films are trash and I turn them off after the first 20 minutes but I really didn't want to turn this one off. You can easily tell that the director was a former stuntman as the action sequences are so good, for me, they are up there with some of the John Wick fights, Chris Hemsworth does well with the role and it's good to see him play a role with a lot more grit and an almost darker side than I've seen in a while especially compared to the MCU.If the action sequences weren't as good then this would get a 5, they make that much of a difference!",

Chris Hemsworth was very brutal on this movie wherein he doesn't waste time on killing so many Police officers(under druglord's payroll). It is a step forward on the right direction for him. He should do more action movies!!The boy's acting was pretty good to. He gives an emotional tone for the whole movie.There is some plot holes in the movie but the action overcomes it. I suggest you watch this movie and I promise that you will be entertained.A special thank to Netflix, I hope there are still more Netflix action movies like this in the future.",

The setting is not your usual location either being in Asia (India) for this type of film either, which is usually South America. Chris Hemsworth proves he can be more than just Thor (who he plays brilliantly I add). The ending was unconventional too, it's happy but not the predictable type of ending you see in most action films, it has heart and makes you feel a connection to the characters and why they are doing some of the things they are.

Heads of the mafia don't let wasted kids in their dining rooms.Most importantly, a big foreign guy like Hemmy doesn't just go around talking suspiciously on the phone in broad daylight in the middle of a busy street in Dhaka without attracting huge crowd. Maybe possible in India, but not in Bangladesh.And then 60-something year old leader of a law & enforcement starts sniping and accurately killing people by headshots from quite a distance?

Randeep Hooda was particularly memorable as his character wasn't the cookie-cutter character as his motivations are revealed.In short, if you have a couple hours to spare and need a bit of high-octane escapism that doesn't require you to turn your brain off, you may enjoy this.

Same notion is valid even in the field of entertainment. If a movie is released by a well-known studio or an actor, there is a standard that it is expected to meet. Thus, when Chris Hemsworth partnered with Netflix to release Extraction on April 24th, there was a certain expectation from this film & I think it's fair to say that it fell short.Extraction is an action-drama set in Bangladesh in which Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), who plays the role of a courageous mercenary, is hired for a perilous extraction in which he has to rescue the kidnapped son of Ovi Mahajan Sr (Pankaj Tripathi), an international criminal. Things start to take a wrong turn for Rake when there is a glitch in the plan and he is left stranded with Ovi Mahajan (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) after rescuing him from the kidnappers. What follows is a 60-minute non-stop action drama following Rake's journey to rescue Mahajan with the help of Saju (Randeep Hooda).Be it Billy Lee in 'Bad Times at the El Royale' or Captain Mitch Nelson in '12 Strong', Chris Hemsworth is one of the few actors who has been able to continuously deliver notable performances outside of Marvel Studios. His performance in Extraction is one of such notable instances. Hemsworth is also supported well by Jaiswal who, despite being only 3 films old, looks completely in his element while sharing the screen with the mighty Thor. Hooda also delivers a convincing performance as an alibi of Tripathi and risks his life for the safety of Mahajan. For all Stranger Things fans, you also see a nice little cameo by David Harbour as Gaspar.Extraction is the testimony of Hemsworth's effort to keep growing as a filmmaker as this feature marks his debut as a producer in films. Speaking of debut, Extraction is also the directorial debut of Sam Hargrave, who is known for his stunts in Avengers: Endgame, Avengers: Infinity War, Deadpool 2, and many other action movies. One could see Hargave's signature all over this movie with dangerously yet immaculately performed stunts - especially in one action sequence that goes on for 11 minutes in which Rake is trying to save Mahajan from the cops and Saju. Hargrave mentioned in his interview that it took him 5 months to create that scene and 10 days to shoot it. Hargrave also clarified that although it looks like a one-long scene from a naked eye, it is actually a compilation of many scenes digitally plastered together.Although the acting, cinematography, production design and stunts are good in this movie, the script doesn't do justice. There are several sub-plots in the movie that are left undiscovered and even the ending demands a little more clarification. Because of its starcast and the current 'stay-at-home' order, this movie will garner more eyeballs than it would have otherwise. But if you are busy pursuing a hobby or have limited disposable time for watching content, you can give this movie a pass.",

But since Chris Hemsworth is in the movie, it's a win-win. the film has a cliched plot that we've seen a ton of times. Interestingly, it takes it and does something different with it. The cinematography is average and the hand to hand combat is absolutely the best I've seen. One really outstanding scene from this film is the long 11-minute long take in one of the action sequences. Of course, it's actually simulated but they probably put it there for a reason. Another worthy aspect of Extraction is the acting performance by Chris Hemsworth. He is really great in the film and works. The complaints I have are the plot and feel of the film. It has that filter of a Mexican movie. Now there are some complaints about the violence being over the top. I didn't mind it since I have seen films that are more violent than this one. Overall, Extraction is an enjoyable action film that you can watch during the quarantine. It will just be another of those films that we forget throughout the week.",

I didn't feel invested in the characters even Chris H, who normally makes everyone he plays likeable, looks like he's finding it hard to project what this guy is about.I haven't finished the film yet as 2 hours of this is way too indulgent and I there are a lot of needless scenes with everyone looking a little bored.It's nice to see a 6 foot white guy save brown people though. He's so pretty and good at his job and the browns are so goddam ugly and corrupt ;-)They should have employed some big name Bollywood stars to make this a proper international production and got someone better to write snappy fun dialogue and who knows it might not have gone straight to Netflix.7 stars for that car chase alone though.",

I was very bias for what seemed to be another modern day action feature; however director Sam Hargrave provided an Australian John Wick instead! The action was incredible, choreography was jaw droppingly flawless. The connections after being shot, punched and thrown against a hard object felt authentic and added to the somewhat realistic fighting style; camera movements were gorgeous, not too shaky to bring disorientation yet not too smooth to take you out of the extremity. The cinematography was adequate, and at times would tell a story in itself which was surprising. The one shot takes were perfect for the moments presented and although cuts weren't well hidden to an experienced viewer, could easily fool a naked eye. Hemsworth's character, although a stereotypical Australian cliche, was enjoyable to watch. In all, the Australian stereotype was smart as it contributed a mateship sentiment to the story. Hemsworth brought an absorbing performance, being unpretentious yet grandiose in action sequences yet considerate and gentle in tender moments. And I appreciated the inner turmoil his character carried, making this more than a shoot, kill, shoot movie. The dialogue was stale but got it's point across. However, the sporadicity in language variations was questionable as to why characters would switch between two languages. The story was as long as it needed to be, little to nothing felt overstayed or unwelcomed other than the subplot of the Bangladesh boy. The ending is touching yet extremely lazy in terms of tying loose ends. And the 'resurrection' of Hemsworth's character was not needed as it destroyed the meaning of his sacrifice. Overall, an exceptional action picture that I'd suggest watching if you're in need of one.",

            "content": "Extraction hardly survived only because of stunning action-packed scenes and Chris Hemsworth. My Rating 2.5/5.Extraction is an action, thriller movie made for tv, By Netflix. Extraction is a story of a fearless assassin who is on a mission to rescue the kidnapped son of an imprisoned international crime lord.Sam Hargrave First-time directed, known for Stunt coordinator films like avengers endgame, Thor Ragnarok, The winter soldier, and many. Cast- Chris Hemsworth in this instead of his hammer he holds firearms. Randeep Hooda and Rudrakash Jaiswal.Pros - Director Sam Hargrave knows what he whats when coming to action scenes, For a car chase scene he chose to tie himself to the hood of the car to record the scene, all his hard work paid off, All stunts, close combat, shooting, all the action scenes are incredible, well-choreographed. With this film, Chris Hemsworth proved, not only hammer he is also good with guns did a great job.Cons - First if I want to spoil the movie for you I can't because there is nothing to say. For most people, Even though it has a great action sequence with a week plot movie seemed aimless didn't grasp the interest.Poor characterization we don't know the motive of the kidnapper, what's the deal of kid ya there are scenes with a kid but that doesn't add up anything to the story.\nAnd what's with red-yellowish filter, although it spends 65 million dollars the production doesn't look like that.-In Dhaka, Bangladesh every one listens to Bollywood songs? Do cars look like that? the accent is like that? NoooooVerdict - Despite the negative, the good thing that is Extraction doesn't drag at all its only 100 min, if it's for theater it's hard to recommend gladly it's not. if you only want to see Chris Hemsworth in action flying bullets Extraction doesn't disappoint you, if not better to watch John wick, The raid, again.Thanks for Reading",

However, if you want a classic action packed movie, this is the one. The action is top notch, and i really enjoyed it. Don't watch this movie if you are looking for something very new and surprising.

It game me the vibe of a JCVD Saturday afternoon movie from the 90's, in HD.I have to give it up to some of the great camera work, but that's mostly due to state-of-the-art stabilizers, so ... well done technology.The whole plot seems like it was written on toilet paper during bathroom breaks from the action scene filming. Even the ending seems to have no point, leaving the watcher to figure out what happens next, but the movie does little to set that up.I would give this movie 3/10, bur some great action scenes and quite decent acting saved it.",

            "content": "Thanks to the developer for making the Extraction movie in the South Asia Region. The movie is based on saving a hostage from Bangladesh. A boy called Ove, who was kidnaped by the most significant drug Diller Amir Asif in Bangladesh and India. The main character was Chris Harmsworth. The base of operation was held in Australia. The movie has extreme violence and lots of action which I liked most. The sound and combat seem realistic. I notice that the filer looks like gloomy according to Bangladeshi culture. They should have added a better filter for a better look; in the movie mercenary Tyler Rake (Chris Harmsworth) as known as an Agent who visits Puran-Dhaka, Bangladesh. The Landmarks, Environment, culture, people everything was realistic. A stranger came with a van and they said to him, 'welcome to Dhaka'. Those people kidnap him and he knew that he has lots of money. But they didn't know that he was a secret agent. He got an escape from the mafia. That action of the agent was so aggressive and enjoyable. But I that time I saw that children with Asselt Rifle and they acting like a terrorist. That was so annoying to see this too me. In the middle of escape with Ove, that was massive action. From the operation base, they were asking Tyler Rake for the drive location. The Police were chasing their car and keep shooting their vehicle. The car crashes were fantastic. Then he entire a building elite team was searching that place. The stealth kill was so perfect in that place. The 12 minutes of this action was so interested in me. The entire sequence consists of a car chase, then a pursuit up some stairs, a fight in a building, a jump from one rooftop to another rooftop, a tumble off an awning, a flight in the street, a fight in the road, and one final of car chase which amounts to about 36 different segments attached together, creating an I, pressure 12 minutes seemingly continuously scene. One thing I notice that Police with badge written Army soldiers again wearing RAB's dress. This is really weird to me. The forces showed that they were bots (Unskilled). But the developer should have research more before making this movie.\nThe accent was not a regional language. Those accents seem like from the west bangle. As a Bangladeshi fan, the Bengali wasn't mush infested. Children speak about toxic behavior. A maximum vehicle like trucks, old model cars are from India. The lighting was low than editing. But overall, the movie has massive actions and also like the camera angle. Hope, If Netflix announces Extraction 2 in Bangladesh, then again welcome to our country. Overall, Impressive action scenes, a talented cast, fabulous direction from Sam Hargrave, and a brilliant screenplay from Joe Russo all these add up to the awesomeness of Extraction. Even though the plot was a bit confusing and the ending was predictable, Extraction is indeed good enough to put a smile on your face.",

The two were the same country before this and were divided only on the basis of religion. That's okay, its a different country with a wonderful PM and they are marching ahead. Good for them. But that doesn't mean they should give bad reviews for this movie.\nThis is a movie that deals with gangsters and mobsters. Those criminals are the same whether they are in India or America or Bangladesh or anywhere else. They do crime, they pull in children in the early age and make them experienced criminals. It happens everywhere in the world, including India. Actually that's the point of the whole movie : I wasn't pissed because Bangladesh was shown like that, but that's reality everywhere.\nI simply don't care how it represents Dhaka because I have never been to Dhaka and simply don't care if it is true or not. Regarding Bengali, it doesn't really matter to a person who doesn't speak Bengali, or for that matter any Indian language (especially with those hindi songs in background - it was weird for me too because I wanted to hear bangladeshi songs too, would've been much more realistic), but who watches action movies for realism.\nAction movies with realism looks like boxing movies without the SFX to back them up.\nThe One BIG plot hole of the movie, how come a crime lord gets access to a militiary commander and a whole bunch of army platoons. Its ridiculous. If we keep that aside, rest of the movie is really good. It makes us think how hard it for children, either mob bosses or not to get into it - like how the Urv gets into making his first kill and similar with the other guy who kills Chris.",

However, as an action movie, it is far better than average. In terms of intensity, originality, and production value, this is often on par with John Wick. True the plot is not particularly intricate and the character development is minimal, but much is done with little. There is no sense that any of the actors are phoning in the performance because on paper they aren't given much of an opportunity to show other dimensions. The movie covers events over a short period of time and the characters are focused on the issues at hand. There are a few breathers but we aren't sidetracked into forced \"lets talk about us\" scenes in the middle of life or death struggle. With the superhero genre beaten to death, a straight-forward fast-paced entertaining film is an increasingly rare gem and well worth the watch.",

Like seriously locking down an entire city to extract a kid! Sepia/Yellow Color Grade on the movie may seem intense and engaging at first suiting the mood but slowly feels redundant and overdone.

I am an Indian and seriously feel that in the name of 'action' thriller most of our film makers just fool us with monotonous action scenes which repeatedly involves humans and cars flying unprecedentedly high in the sky after an explosion or a punch of the actor who isn't even playing the role of any superhero. This movie had a top hollywood and bollywood celebrity (Helmsworth and Randeep Hooda) and both did their jobs perfectly well, this just proves that Indian actors aren't anyway less than the best of the world when given a good director.There were some shortcomings too, it had too much of violence and it didn't have a strong story and a plot to compliment such well shot action sequences and amazing cinematography, the story telling wasn't at it's best yet this movie seems to be the best action movie shot in South Asia.",

But I must repeat that the combat scenes and the pacing was excellent. I've read some critiques that were critical of the portrayal of the India and Bangladesh locales, that the depictions of the scenery and the people were not accurate. Be that as it may, I was more enamored by the highly skilled heroes (anyone who has fired a weapon on the move will appreciate) then the scenery.

I simply don't understand why they had to use a name of a city which has no relevance with what was shown.

I wouldn't mind if the plot wasn't revolved around Dhaka. The whole story was about rescuing a boy from a gangster based in Dhaka. So the movie should've felt like it's happening in Dhaka. The Bengali accent was inaccurate, the accent used in this movie is from West Bengal, India not from Bangladesh. Child terrorism was never a thing in Bangladesh but the movie clearly emphasized on it. The roads, police, vehicles, locations, buildings, and even the commonly used Bengali fonts on banners and posters are from West Bengal. So this is not nearly an accurate depiction of Dhaka. A slight mismatch would be considerable but this is completely messed up!However, only the people from Bangladesh will feel this way. Everyone else will love this movie.

Now they could have changed the plot in another manner to not let this happen, but it is something to be pointed out as a negative factor..\n2. Lack of Character depth...\nThis movie primarily focuses on Tyler, the 14 year old Ovi and Saju of course, but there were so many more characters who could have got a better role, and they lacked character depth, even Chris Hemsworth's past wasn't that satisfactory... If the characters had bit more of a content, it would have helped the plot to be better as well...\nNow what I LIKED about the film\n1. The Hand to hand combat, chase sequences and Gunfights\nI am not gonna type much about this cuz you got to watch the movie for that\n2. The performances (The Cast)\nEvery character in this movie was excellent with great acting. Chris Hemsworth's character is well written and his emotional moments are also good... Randeep Hooda was awesome and finally got recognition for his talent through this film... all other characters were good too...\n3. The emotional moments\nThis film is also gonna surprise you wth some emotional moments as well like between the child and Tyler, and even the emotional bonding between them...\nIt would be impactful for even those who do not like action films\nAs a whole I would just say that though the movie is not that good in terms of its storyline, it would not fail to impress in the action... Watch it if you r a die hard action film fan\nSkip it if you r looking for an engaging plot with twists and turns and less violence",

It's about the minimum authenticity of cultural elements that a film must follow. And who are ignoring this fact I believe they also praise movies where their countries are portrayed in a wrong way. Also, so many elements and details regarding Dhaka was this much incorrect that psychologically people who know Dhaka couldn't like it. But see the irony, whole the film was about a city in the background!!!! And that background is incorrect. So, if the target was just to promote good action and make profits then yah, you have done it. Otherwise as a movie, thumbs down! Anyway, if the shoot was taken place in Wakanda, still not worth of higher rates because the plot is about nothing. Just action.Vandalism!",

The action sequences were incredible, for lack of a better word and the story line is quite believable considering the real world.For me, watching a great movie means that I have to be drawn to it from beginning to end. I went into the film with a lot of expectation considering the likes of 13 Hours and Lone Survivor.

Even the setting which was supposed to be Dhaka was not at all in Dhaka. There is no forest around Buriganga river that runs through Dhaka. The mistake was sticking like a sore thumb. The women, the people, the sign boards, the accents of Bangla slang were all wrong. It could have been an excellent work if they could do it properly. They were using Calcutta tongue not Dhakaia language.This is was so disappointing.All the 7 star is for my favorite actor Chris Hemsworth. I could have been proud for this movie as it was staged in Bangladesh. Only if it were a reality - they could have done it Gazipur district with lots of forest to play firepower.

However, it is different, but only in the most miserable sense...Sure it's gun play is video game sharp (that's where my points for the film score), but it's soul is entirely borrowed, and never quite felt. So, hundreds of faceless, in this case Bangladeshi, people wiped out by a dubiously motivated white super soldier mercenary is always a horribly regrettable clich\u00e9 of modern cinema. Bears absolutely no comparison to any historic reality. Unlike the gun violence in the USA, Bangladesh is simply not a gun toting country of child gangs and lawless gunplay. Famously, a warm and welcoming country, and rightly or wrongly, a pretty sedate, and ordered society. Not without it's problems, but nothing like this portrayal.So, regrettably, without local precedent, it becomes a relentless slog of just killing. Human destruction, nihilism of the worst kind. I actually hoped Hemsworth would stop early on, and the film would make more intelligent choices not his choice of course. He was funny in the Thors, but Brad Pitt he ain't.... Wink wink... Of course it didn't change, more faceless bodies piled up, urgh.Its essentially a complete video game fantasy for middle Americans, translated to film. Murdering the foreigners, just an impotent bedroom fantasy about death and murder, and not much else. Morbid fantasy for gamers, nothing for mankind.

Especially, if that country is the main setting of major Hollywood production for the first time ever.The production team might have taken some 'plateshots' of some filthy, dingy, overcrowded outskirts of the capital city of the story, which is fine, but that seemed to be the only thing to say about the city. The real nicer locations (not some artificial set) and millions of well educated middle class residents of the same city are totally missing. This is wrong, in my opinion.The law enforcement agencies as a whole have been portrayed as utterly corrupt and incompetent. Almost every single members of the force seemed to be chasing Chris Hemsworth and his band of hired guns like spellbound insects heading to light traps to meet their brutal ends. Explosions, gun fires, car crashes all happening nonstop in overcrowded and narrow suburban streets with complete disregard to many many innocent lives to save only the life of a kidnapped son of a drug lord.

Direction in respect to story telling is not up to the mark as it lacks the layers of a cinema that would unfold as it progresses.Coming to the point of characters, casting is very good, Indian actors like Randeep Hooda, Manoj Bajpai are really good actors, but they are being completely wasted as there's no space of character development or character progression. The whole film surrounds around Hemsworth, and I'll not say his performance is bad, but also not great.Action films of 90s have a similar pace and style.The only thing good about this movie is its execution of action sequences and its cinematography. The scenes are shot from great angle, and it's no surprise as the Ruso brothers are very fond of them. The movie has used a rusty color grading to portray Dhaka similiar to that used in breaking bad to portray Mexico.\nFor a industry like Hollywood it's very easy to decorate a movie with all this ornaments to make it look professional and eye catching, but at the end of the day it doesn't increases it's cinematic values.In summarisation I'll say this is not a good movie, the outcome of it is disappointing im respect for expectations. But one can watch it for entertainment or momentary thrill.",

            "content": "Bangladesh has been one of the most obscure countries in the world. Other than it's obvious poverty, not much is known about this country. Extraction has been one of the first appearances of Bangladesh in Hollywood. And it is a complete insult to Bangladeshi people. Bangladesh is not a great country. There is rampant poverty, large economic disparity, the issue of terrorism, and rise in illegal drugs and gambling. But in this movie, Bangladesh is portrayed as if it is Yemen or a generic African country. Dhaka city is shown as yellow, as if it has jaundice. Also the city is shown to be near a jungle. There are no jungles in near Dhaka or in the Dhaka district.The nearest jungles would be around Sylhet or Khulna. Land around Dhaka is mostly farmland. Also Dhaka is portrayed as lawless with the police and \"Elite\"units under one drug lord. There is no such unit called an \"Elite\". The closest would be the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB). Portraying them as under the payroll of drug lords is insulting as they were the ones who have been carrying out a controversial crackdown against them and illegal gamblers recently. The movie also features children walking around with AK-47 SMGs in public, like as if Bangladesh is a war-torn African country. Bangladesh is one of those emerging economies, on par with Vietnam. Dhaka city may contain slums, but they do not make up the entire city. The movie also shows Hindi songs playing in every house. Bangladesh also has a music industry. Also, the local Bangla spoken is nothing like the one spoken in Bangladesh. It sounds more like a West Bengali accent like those spoken in Kolkata. They not only did not shoot the movie in Bangladesh, filming mostly in Ahmedabad in India with some scenes filmed in Thailand. There were also no Bangladeshi actors used with most of the locals being played by Indians such as Rudraksh Jaiswal. Also one the cast members is an Iranian named Golshifteh Farahani. Iranians are not the same as Bangladeshis. Also Iranians should stop playing Indians, Bangladeshis, and Arabs as a lot of them are willing to play negative stereotypes of Muslims and Arabs. Navid Negahan being one. The inaccuracies are as bad as those of Dan Brown novels such as Digital Fortress, which got Seville wrong, and Homeland, which gets things wrong about Beirut, Islamabad, and Islam. People try to justify these by using the \"it's fiction\"excuse. Other than those inaccuracies, the movie also follows a white savior narrative. Our hero Tyler Rake is a typical white action hero. Although not an American, as Rake is made Australian to match his actor Chris Hemsworth, he has traits of a typical white American action hero. Just to save one child, he massacres many Bangladeshis. The movies plot is partly borrowed from the far superior Man on Fire, starring the Denzel Washington. The former atleast wasn't a modern \"Might Whitey\" story and had actual Mexican actors for a movie set in Mexico. People seem to really think this is best movie since John Wick. This movie has nothing in common with John Wick other than the brilliant fight scenes. It is more of a spiritual successor to Beirut (2018), due to its white savior narrative and inaccurate portrayal of a certain city in a developing country.",

            "content": "I didn't have high expectations for this movie, but I figured a Chris Hemsworth action pic would provide a couple hours of diverting of pulp entertainment.\nWhere did it go wrong for me?\nThe action scenes were well choreographed with lots of fiery explosions, chases & hand to hand combat etc, but about half way through the film it got to the point where it became cartoonish & mechanical. The swarms of bad guys were inept & couldn't shoot straight to the point where it was hard to believe our hero was in any real danger, whatever the odds. It all became very predicable & mind numbing.\nThe plot is weak, even for pulp. The story revolves around a kidnapping, the reason for which is never really established. Hemsworths character is a walking \"mercenary with a painful past\" clich\u00e9. The quiet, intimate scenes meant to show his humanity are painfully, awkwardly done, as unbelievable as the overdone action sequences and feel like pro forma filler. Too many unbelievable coincidences. Very senseless & disjointed.\nHaving said all that, I might have given this film a \"5\" as an action pic if it wasn't for its arbitrary and misleading setting in Bangladesh. As I watched the film I kept thinking that the portrayal of the of city Dhaka is very harsh. Criminals controlling the army & police, a dirty, filthy city, gangs roaming the streets, including kids with AKs - basically Somalia at its worst. And wondered why would Bangladesh allow a film to be shot in Dhaka when it portrays it in such a negative light?\nWell, the answer I soon learned is that this film was written, produced and shot in India by Indians and there are no Bengalis at all in the cast. Now there's no reason the plot couldn't have been set in a city in India, other than of course the Indian producers didn't want one of their own cities to be shown as dirty, dangerous, violent, lawless and corrupt. So they moved the whole thing next door to Bangladesh. Never mind that there's no objective evidence that Dhaka is anything like it's portrayed in the film, or for that matter, any worse than cities in India. Just dump the whole dirty, lawless mess on the people across the border.\nI have to wonder if the fact that India now has a Hindu nationalist led government and Bangladesh is 90% Muslim played a factor in all this too.\nThumbs down on Netflix and Chris Hemsworth for their association with this tainted picture.\n(BTW, I have no personal connection to either country.)",

Be it any Latin American country, a country in the African continent and especially Middle Eastern countries.\nIt seems like they are finally starting to get India right, though Hollywood must think that all other countries around it must be the same. If Netflix went through such lengths to acknowledge a small country like Bangladesh and base the entire movie on it (which is a huge deal for countries which are not always known to the world), then why not get it right? The movie must have spent millions of dollars to produce such a massive action movie only to show a very expensive knock-off version of India. Chris Hemsworth has done an amazing job with his acting, and his action sequences were outstanding. But he could only cover so much of the incompetence of both the story and the setting.\nBelieve me, the natives who are complaining here are not because we feel that our country does not have any problems. It is because we do have a whole list of them, but none that were shown in this movie. For imagination I give this movie a higher score than I intended to.",

Voice over explains the warring drug/organized crime cartels. Kidnapping served two purposes... revenge(one can assume) and embarrassment to the father in prison.\nPlot... Tyler Rake and his partners are hired to get the boy back, man in charge of boy's protection fails and is tasked in returning boy or losing his own family, man decides to double cross Team Chris and everything goes crazy.\nThere are touching moments scattered throughout the movie. We see flashbacks that Chris has, Chris and the kidnapped boy make a connection, Chris sacrifices himself to save the boy and the ending is uplifting if you believe that blurry figure that the boy sees is Chris.\nNothing that new or groundbreaking but very enjoyable!",

It is a well-hyped and much awaited movie and in the current scenario, when hardly any new movie is being released, this will surely draw a great number of views for sure.When you start watching this movie, do not expect a masterpiece and it will become easier for you to enjoy the journey. Not a very complicated story, good performances and some amazing action sequences will ensure that you are thoroughly engaged.A lot of Hindi and Bengali have been used in the movie. As I am familiar with both the languages, it turned out alright for me but I am not sure about the experiences of those who don't understand either of the languages. But hearing Thor: The god of thunder, saying 'Promaan deyo' is surely going to be a treat for all the Bengalis out there.Extraction - Netflix\nChris Hemsworth carried the entire movie on his shoulders and being the executive producer of the movie he had very little scope to go wrong and to that point, he hardly disappoints you throughout the movie. Between both his falls (his first scene and the last scene), he has given a power packed performance.\nThe kidnapped kid (Rudraksh Jaiswal) shared many scenes with Chris and he successfully managed to stand tall throughout the movie. But the movie does leave you wishing Randeep Huda's character was a bit better defined. Half of the time you will not be able to decide whether to root for him or not. Moreover, it was a sheer waste to give Pankaj Tripathi such less screen time. It would have been much better to cast him as the Bangladeshi drug lord. He would have made the extraction far more difficult than it seemed at the end.The kidnapped kid (Rudraksh Jaiswal) shared many scenes with Chris and he successfully managed to stand tall throughout the movie.

And these are the few thing they revealed in the movie.\nTop of that movie lacks originality, I do not consider a \"Gun Battle\" movie as an Action movie, people are hiding and taking cover shooting some random guys, people falling from buildings and just acting like they got shot is really not an action movie. I say almost 80% of the action scene in this movie are related to gun battle, remaining 20% action scenes are heavily inspired from the Indonesian movie called \"The Raid\", same kind of action within building and people being killed on stairs.

If you like John Wick or have played Doom before and really like the game, you will love this movie.If you are that kinda person who likes non stop executions, gore, violence and do not really care about the logic and practical scenarios... oh boy you are in for another treat. It's just like any other fast and furious movie out there, does not make sense but does a really great job in giving you the non stop crisp untouchable hero action. Just as I said, if you love Doom, you'll love this.\nBecause Chris Hemsworth has done it again ladies and gentleman. A banger yet again. I wouldn't say a masterclass, but good.2. If you're that kinda guy who doesn't like being left hanging for dead in the end, JUST WALK AWAYNow, if you're that kinda person who wants to understand the complete plot, who doesn't really like thinking about the movie for weeks, analyzing every aspect of the movie to understand the ending? Like I said. JUST WALK AWAY.But hey, every movie is unique in it's own perspective. You gotta appreciate the efforts put in.3. If you're that person who likes to appreciate the bonding between the people, like to just flow through emotions, viewing the scenario through one's shoes, THIS IS JUST WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.If you're the person who really binds with the characters on the screen, really like empathizing, go ahead. Extraction does a good job in portraying the different walks of life.Now coming to my review:Why 7/10? Here it goes ..1. As you guessed it, Chris carried the whole movie. The others characters were really bland. It felt artificial and I felt the scripted dialogues even before my brain could decipher it.2. Most of the plot is predictable. And again, it's the same amateur mistakes again.The trailer revealed the entire movie's plot. Very poor decisions made by the team. There is nothing special to the plot, it's just raw. And RAW as in Gordon Ramsey's verses.3. The sound effects was very average. The sounds of the guns firing, the police sirens, the nades, the smokes, the frags, everything seemed out of place. Visuals were fine, the soundtracks were fine, yeah, Just about does it guess.So all in all, it's just a one timer, nothing too special to watch it over and over again unless you're a die hard fan. I would say this movie is alright.",

There are some good stuff in between. The exterior locations are exotic. There are some good Indian actors in the villain roles. The roof top scene with the kids is fun.

This isn't Africa, people don't employ child soldiers here. And certainly carry Ak-47 in hand and in the open.The Police uniform and looks are completely misjudged. They are trying to portray the elite force of Bangladesh, Known as Rapid Action Battalion. They are not regular police. They deal with counter-terrorism and similar stuff. It should've been the police that deals with criminal or action in the street. Police vehicles are wrong. Don't get me wrong, the entire movie is brilliantly shot and exceptionally action-packed. But this provides a complete misrepresentation of Bangladesh, as well as the city of Dhaka. People who don't have an idea about Bangladesh will get a false sense for a beautiful country by the misrepresented set of this movie.And finally the accents. the accent of the locals are wrong, they are speaking in an accent that's commonly used in West Bengal, India.

Story 6/10 - it needed more character development, some more details, some more writing\n6. Soundtrack 10/10\n7. Culture wise 8/10For me, personally, it was a nice movie revelation for 2020. Took me back to Black Hawk Down, Man On Fire, Slum dog Millionaire, Sicario and you know what, it's all about how It made me feel watching the movie and it felt great!As far as \"this is not Dhaka, this is not Bangladesh\" comments, let me tell you something about geo-political accuracy, from my perspective, the guy who grew up watching movies about my country simplified to Dracula, Transilvania, poverty and native language portrayed as Russian: GET OVER IT!Thanks.",

They do their job well, which is why we can go out, visit places, hang out with friends and more without worrying about random shootings (like they show in the movie).3. Dhaka's streets are NOT violent and it's NOT normal for people to fight in public with guns and swords. The movie made it seem like the people are used to things like these happening and somehow it's the norm here.4. An entire movie set to be in Dhaka and not a SINGLE major Bangladeshi character played by someone who SPEAKS the language and dialect that we do in Bangladesh? Are you for real, Netflix?

It stars Chris Hemsworth as ''Tyler Rake'', Rudhraksh Jaiswal as ''Ovi Mahajan Jr'', Golshifteh Farahani as ''Nik Khan'' and Randeep Hooda as ''Saju Rav''. Extraction takes place in Bangladesh, India in present period, over a couple of days. This is an action-thriller movie.\nOvi is the son of Ovi Mahajan Sr. the biggest drug lord in India and for that reason he lives a very sheltered life, has to come home right after school, gets driven around everywhere by people who work for his father and doesn't have a lot of contact with people. He sneaks out to meet his friends in the beginning of the movie and gets kidnapped by men working for Amir Asif, biggest drug lord in Bangladesh. We then meet Tyler Rake, a black-market mercenary and former Australian Special Air Service Regiment soldier, who has a traumatic past and obviously does these jobs hoping to catch a bullet one day. He gets recruited by a fellow mercenary Nik Khan to rescue and extract Ovi Mahajan. Tyler gets briefed on the plan and gets kidnapped by Amir's men. When they take of his mask, he sees many guys with guns pointing at him and he also sees Ovi there. As they escort Tyler away to get the money a sniper kills one of the men and Tyler takes the other one down. After that we get an amazing and brutal fighting scene which ends with Tyler getting Ovi back. They don't get to the extraction point because an assassin took all the people down. We then get an amazing 11-minute one shot looking chase/fight scene. He is told that he must leave the kid because there isn't going to be any payment from Ovi Sr., but he isn't going to do that. Now this is pretty much all I can say before I enter spoiler territory.\nExtraction is an awesome movie that has amazing stunts, chases, fights and cinematography. Now the story may not be that amazing, but the other stuff makes the movie so much better. The CGI in the movie could be a lot better but I let it slide because it is a feature debut film from Sam Hargrave. If you like the John Wick franchise, this movie is right up your ally. This movie gets an 8/10 from me.",

Both the character of Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Hooda were great in their fights.The accuracy is what is I believe at 60%. The location is picked as Dhaka, especially around the Buriganga river. We have the involvement of Dhaka Police, the military, and another government force known as \"Elite\", which closely resembles the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) of Bangladeshi Armed Forces. Most of their clothes were accurate to a good degree, but when I look at the faces of the actors, including the Commander of the \"Elite\" force, they feel alien to me. Their faces did not feel familiar with the minute characteristics of Bangladeshi people, including facial structure, body structure among others, which made it feel unnatural. I'd say if possible, they should've taken some Bangladeshi actors or background crew to make it look more realistic.The way the characters were talking was also borderline grey as some dialogues felt natural to the way some of the goons speak, especially the kids. But at the same time, the style of talking of the older characters felt more close to something from West Bengal Bengali rather than the Bengali from Dhaka, which we colloquially call, \"Dhakaiya Bangla\".In conclusion, movie felt good with the action, but there were so many plot holes, as to how Ovi was kidnapped and transported, how Tyler's crew entered the country with such weapons and the logistics. All it felt was something out of a script about getting a \"package\" out, without any character development.They have done a great job setting up the environment to be as real as possible.\nAfter all being a bengali you will love the Bangali accents in a Hollywood flim.",

            "content": "The movie started really well, and I like Chris as an actor. I thought it was an interesting setting with a decent plot (for this kind of movies).However, the movie fell apart when Chris' actions started to make no sense at all. His moral compass is so out of whack that the whole movie becomes unbelievable, like he acts only to justify action scenes.I don't think I'm nitpicking: to enjoy a movie I need believable characters that act rationally, or at least according to their own logic. So let's see:1) Chris \"takes pity\" of a kid with an AK that is trying to kill him. He doesn't see him as a threat at all, as the kid is fumbling with the weapon pointed at him. I guess he didn't watch Lord of War and he doesn't know that a bullet from a 14 years old is as effective as the bullet from a 40 years old.2) Then, he's attacked by a gang of drug dealers/criminals, which are teenagers. Because they are teenagers (I assume) again Chris refuses to hurt them even after they are repeatedly trying to kill him. Well Chris, if these criminals that you spared then kill some innocent person as part of their criminal activities, that's on you.3) You might be thinking that Chris is a peaceful mercenary that has a code against killing, like Batman. However, there's a long scene in which he massacres scores of...cops. That's right. Cops. Not corrupted cops, I mean regular cops part of a SWAT team that are trying to apprehend what they know is a dangerous armed criminal. Don't these cops have families? Don't their lives matter? Why is Chris sparing criminals but killing cops just trying to do their job? Oh, to try to hide this double standard the director thought of covering the cops' faces. Cheap.4) Then, he decides to become best buddies with another character, for the sole reason that this other character was trying to rescue the same kid. The problem? This character is a mercenary who just killed Chris's team. So apparently Chris doesn't mind that this guy has just murdered his companions. They don't have any character development (probably on purpose) but still, you'd expect Chris to want revenge for his companions, not to start working together with this guy.5) And the biggest of all: Chris decides to throw his life away for this kid, whom he just met. That's ridiculous. Because Chris has lost a child (because, of course he has), then he becomes so emotionally attached to a random kid (who doesn't look like him) after speaking with him for a few hours? That is absurd. Are children interchangeable now?Wow, Chris, do you know that adoption is a thing?In summary, it ruins the movie when the protagonist does irrational things only to do what the plot needs to make action scenes.",

The plausibility of such a scenario is dependent on the level of corruption in that part of the world: it seems the entire military arm of the country was under the control of Asif (drug dealer no. 2), and the free movement of the mercenaries, through the air and on the ground, may be a little far fetched. But I digress.The main scene that hit home for me was when Rake was critically wounded on the bridge and was thinking about his son. Throughout the whole film Rake is portrayed as someone who has seriously lost his way; alcoholism and drug use, no real direction, and essentially riddled with the guilt of losing his son. Moreover, when he tries to think of his son early on in the film, he is consistently blurred out. The image of his son is only clear when he finally saves Ovi. The theme is mysteriously Christian and redemptive in nature: Rake's soul was undoubtedly in jeopardy before his fateful mission, and perhaps he would have lost his son for all eternity - hence the blurred, lack of clarity. However, as the saying goes, laying down our lives for our brothers and sisters covers a multitude of sins, and when Ovi is finally safe and the mission completed, the blurriness seizes - his actions justified him before God, he received forgiveness, and was finally given the gift of eternal life with his son.",

Chris Hemsworth plays a likable character, a tough ex-army and a mercenary on the outside and a depressive, suicidal alcoholic waiting to get off of his misery. The kid on the other hand is decent and sympathetic, they gelled together. Another interesting character to look out for is Saju played by Randeep, he is calm and poise in the beginning and would go to extremes to save his family. You feel for him and at times it's difficult to take sides between charactersThe impressive part of the movie is the location and imagery with dusty brown pallet backed with intense action sequences and the cultural diversity. Beautiful colors, ruthless drug mafia, Hindi rap songs and Dhaka families watching Bollywood movies amidst chaos.I think people shouldn't get so bent out of shape regarding the portrayal of the country and people in it. It's just a movie the same negativity arose when Slumdog Millionaire released, people were so upset regarding the portrayal of country and slums but it's just a movie and there's a lot to take from it to enjoy and get entertained.It's fun to watch and relax on a Friday evening, nothing much.",

It also doesn't help that his stunt coordinator for his Marvel films directed this movie. Extraction yells mediocrity from beginning to end.Chris Hemsworth is called to rescue the son of a Hindu drug lord in Dhaka. The plot is simple enough, but OOPS, it lacks foresight, character development, and anything resembling logic. It's obvious Russo wrote this script while his mind was on Avengers, because the story is so surface level and dull that nothing feels salvageable. This is because the film moves so quickly to get to Dhaka and the action scenes that there's no time to develop character.Chris Hemsworth plays a mercenary who's ONLY character trait is that he misses his dead son. THAT'S IT! Beyond that, he's just a soulless automaton. The man who kidnaps the boy has no character outside of \"I'm the villain, therefore I kidnap kids and kill them\" and THAT'S IT. The boy, named Ovi, has no trait other than \"My father treats me like a thing\" and THAT'S IT. All the main characters have little to no character so I couldn't care about them. The secondary characters have more going for them!The filmmaking and editing are by-the-books bland. Other than the typical shaky cam and odd angled action shots, there's a random LONG take shot that comes outta nowhere and just took me out of the movie. It's so out of place from the rest of the movie-plus it totally doesn't help the action scenes one bit-that I felt the director ONLY did it because he wanted to show off and be like \"HEY, I CAN SHOOT A LONG SHOT ACTION TAKE TOO!\" I hate using this word-because it's often overused and misused-but it came off as utterly pretentious and unnecessary.Extraction is ONLY getting praise for the action scenes, which I find to be very disconcerting. Like I said, the action scenes aren't anything special. I've heard some people call it the John Wick of mercenary films?? ehhhhh, no. John Wick at least has character and is campy enough to have fun watching. This film is just a mediocre, poorly thought out, sad waste of time and Chris Hemsworth. If you want to watch a really good mercenary type film on Netflix-in the same vein of Extraction-watch Triple Frontier.",

To get money from the poor bad guy who's in prison? How did they expect that to work?The poor bad guy threatens his associate (from prison, while being broke) who's not in prison to save his son. Who's still working for the poor bad guy? Why are they working for the poor bad guy? It's not like he can pay anyone.So the associate decides to call in an extraction team to save the son but stiffs them on their payment, taking half the extraction team out instead.Then he comes after the protagonist (Hemsworth) to take the son from him. It's never really clear if the associate is trying to save or kill the kid since he keeps shooting at the car where both Hemsworth and the kid is in. But then all of the sudden, he agrees to help Hemsworth to get the kid out of the city? A very inconsistent flip there.But the thing that really annoys me with movies like this is that they basically kill 200+ service men/women (military and law enforcement) to save ONE kid. Yes, the police chief was in the second bad guys pocket, but that doesn't mean that all his service personnel (the 200+ people that actually died) was. They were probably just following orders, trying to catch an American mad man who's running around killing people all over for no apparent reason.The story deserves a minus score. I gave it 3 because the production value was high and the acting (it wasn't that much acting though) was fair and fine. The story was simply too dumb for me to give it higher than a 3.I'm just so tired of movies where the protagonist runs around and kills innocent people while they expect you to root for them. It's like the old cop movies where they run around in crowded cities, shooting their guns around or having car chases in 200mph through busy business streets, risking hundreds of innocent peoples lives.",

I didn't have much hope for the rest of the film. However, it surprised me. The film had jaw dropping action scenes, heartwarming moments, some funny scenes and when the films climax came about you were really in the moment with the main characters.The action scenes are masterfully done with some jaw dropping stunts and great fight scenes. The chase scenes are likewise amazingly done with the camera flitting from the main characters to the chasers, passersby, and others driving the chase forward in a unique way which was amazing to watch.Would have marked it a full 10/10 were it not for a few predictable moments which you saw coming a mile off and saddened me for the fact they'd still use movie plot devices like that knowing that we, the audience, have seen it time and time again and spoils the movie when you predict it yourself. Saying that, it balanced well with other scenes where it totally surprised you and left your mouth hanging open with awe.Overall, an amazing film which doesn't fail to keep you rooted to the edge of your seat. Chris Helmsworth, as usual is at his best. What a rush! Loved it from start to finish. Would definitely recommend",

If they set the scene somewhere else in Bangladesh, it would've been more convincing. The roads are basically dirt roads in this movie where Dhaka has one of the best road systems in the Country. Dhaka doesn't have that kinda dense jungle anywhere near the city, certainly not near the Buriganga river.The criminal class in Bangladesh is completely different. This isn't Africa, people don't employ child soldiers here. And certainly carry guns in hand and in the open.The Police uniform and looks are completely misjudged. They are trying to portray the elite force of Bangladesh, Known as Rapid Action Battalion. They are not regular police. They deal with counter-terrorism and similar stuff. It should've been the police that deals with criminal or action in the street. Police vehicles are wrong. Don't get me wrong, the entire movie is brilliantly shot and exceptionally action-packed. But this provides a complete misrepresentation of Bangladesh, as well as the city of Dhaka. People who don't have an idea about Bangladesh will get a false sense for a beautiful country by the misrepresented set of this movie.And finally the accents. the accent of the locals are wrong, they are speaking in an accent that's commonly used in West Bengal, India. Dhaka and People in Bangladesh, in General, have a completely different accent.In one word production team fu*ked a good story.",

I've been counting on it as the most dramatic action film.I've watched the movie with hell lot of expectations but after watching, I felt that there are multiple grey areas in the story, many of which are incomprehensible.Dialogs are in 3 different languages, English, Hindi & Bangla, hard to watch without subtitles for global audience. What happened to English and dubbed versions? Audience could have lived with these options very well.The cast list is good enough to make it an excellent block buster but seems the story failed to bind the cast with it.The film story seems much baseless and created by some novice writer.The kid of an Indian drug dealer is kidnapped by another drug dealer from Bangladesh but the Indian drug dealer couldn't pay the ransom because his assets are frozen.\nReally? That's how drug dealers work? Using legitimate assets and banks? What about the warehouse full of cash lying around as always shown in the movies?\nAnd why would a drug dealer kidnap the BROKEN opponent's kid? Where is the ground for the kidnapping? Or just for fun? How the kid is transported from Mumbai to Dhaka? Using a chartered plane or ship or by road or how?Pankaj Tripathi played an Indian Drug Dealer. Using him for less than 5 mins seems an insult for the actor's caliber as he's an astonishing actor and known for playing a cool headed bad guy in Indian film & television industry. He could have been of much use as either opponent or a strong character in the movie.Which role did Randeep Hooda play? Is he a partner with the kid's father or security or something else. In case he played a security officer's character then the writer must have been drunk while writing his character. The only introduction to the character's abilities are from a photograph dressed as army personnel, no other description.But, Randeep gets full attention in his weak role also, even if he attacks Rake after rescuing the kid from goons.\nIf his character \"Saju\" is so brave, intelligent, can travel to Dhaka and fight a bunch of mercenaries then why didn't he thought of rescuing the kid instead of hiring Rake as mercenary when he knew there is no money to pay him. His involvement with the rescue would have been known to the opponent anyway.What about the opponent Bangladeshi drug dealer? What's his contribution to the film other than wearing nice suits, sitting around, speaking nonsense and sipping drinks? And he illegally ties up with a Colonel from Bangladesh Army? Man, it gets worst and worst towards the end.Golshifteh Farahani's character, Nik Khan, handles the team but no tactical experience or decision making in critical situations. The only memorable is her expressionless face.Chris Hemsworth justified his character elegantly and played it very well but details about the character are so vague that I failed to grasp character's motives till the end. The stunts are nicely coordinated and stimulates goosebumps while watching. But, his friend who owes Rake his life, betrays and tries to kill him. Pity on the character for having such a friend.I've seen many Hollywood movies but the lowest grade director from Hollywood may have a better shot of getting nice reviews than Extraction's director.Seems, the film is a waste of talented actors like Chris Hemsworth, Pankaj Tripathi, Randeep Hooda and many others.It could have been a great movie by Chris Hemsworth as a producer.\nBut, the screenplay writers and the director killed the film with lack of knowledge about South Asian cultures, Geography and people's behaviour.",

And how kids get pulled into a life of violence like berhad and that little kid, who keeps coming back after you spare him. That kid was funny. And that sewer scene, OMG, I hope that was a fake sewer made just for that scene.Also some things that I think were confusing:\nIn the beginning on the boat, Saji didn't have to kill the entire team and G. They were both on the same side. Lack of communication right there lol.\nAnd portrayal of Dhaka maybe a bit exaggerated. Never been there but I don't think it's like that, it is the capital city of Bangladesh.P.S: Why you gotta do saju like that in the end xDTLDR:\n80% Action\n10% Emotion\n10% Plot\nGo for it",

            "content": "Just watched the Netflix special \"Extraction\" starring Chris Hemsworth. I am extremely disappointed with the HORRIBLE misrepresentation of Dhaka. Dhaka AND its law enforcers deserve a MUCH better portrayal in front of the world. Reasons below (no spoilers on the storyline). #ExtractionIsNotDhaka1. Children don't carry rifles on the streets of Dhaka in broad daylight. It's a horrible misrepresentation shown in the movie. If I didn't live in Dhaka myself, I would be mistaken into thinking child terrorism is normal in Dhaka.2. Law enforcers in Dhaka - whether it be DMP, RAB or any of the defense organizations - are NOT incompetent and incapable of stopping two random guys flying in from outside the country. They do their job well, which is why we can go out, visit places, hang out with friends and more without worrying about random shootings (like they show in the movie).3. Dhaka's streets are NOT violent and it's NOT normal for people to fight in public with guns and swords. The movie made it seem like the people are used to things like these happening and somehow it's the norm here.4. An entire movie set to be in Dhaka and not a SINGLE major Bangladeshi character played by someone who SPEAKS the language and dialect that we do in Bangladesh? Are you for real, Netflix? All the major characters spoke Bengali like they do in West Bengal / Kolkata - NOT how we speak in Bangladesh - although they were representing characters in Bangladesh. Why? My mother was an actress, a lot of my friends are too. I'm sure many Bangladeshi actors could do those roles better than any of the ones who did, WHILE speaking our language/dialect.Overall, it's a horrible misrepresentation of the country in front of the world by a cast which isn't even 1% Bangladeshi. People abroad don't know a whole lot about Dhaka, but after they watch this movie, they might get the wrong impression that Dhaka lacks law enforcement and is filled with violence.This is not my Dhaka, this is not any Dhaka.PS: This is my opinion on the movie, as someone who was actually born and brought up in Dhaka.",

I am extremely disappointed with the HORRIBLE misrepresentation of Dhaka. Dhaka AND its law enforcers deserve a MUCH better portrayal in front of the world. Reasons below (no spoilers on the storyline). #ExtractionIsNotDhaka1. Children don't carry rifles on the streets of Dhaka in broad daylight. It's a horrible misrepresentation shown in the movie. If I didn't live in Dhaka myself, I would be mistaken into thinking child terrorism is normal in Dhaka.2. Law enforcers in Dhaka - whether it be DMP, RAB or any of the defense organizations - are NOT incompetent and incapable of stopping two random guys flying in from outside the country. They do their job well, which is why we can go out, visit places, hang out with friends and more without worrying about random shootings (like they show in the movie).3. Dhaka's streets are NOT violent and it's NOT normal for people to fight in public with guns and swords. The movie made it seem like the people are used to things like these happening and somehow it's the norm here.4. An entire movie set to be in Dhaka and not a SINGLE major Bangladeshi character played by someone who SPEAKS the language and dialect that we do in Bangladesh? Are you for real, Netflix? All the major characters spoke Bengali like they do in West Bengal / Kolkata - NOT how we speak in Bangladesh - although they were representing characters in Bangladesh. Why? My mother was an actress, a lot of my friends are too. I'm sure many Bangladeshi actors could do those roles better than any of the ones who did, WHILE speaking our language/dialect.Overall, it's a horrible misrepresentation of the country in front of the world by a cast which isn't even 1% Bangladeshi. People abroad don't know a whole lot about Dhaka, but after they watch this movie, they might get the wrong impression that Dhaka lacks law enforcement and is filled with violence.This is not my Dhaka, this is not any Dhaka.PS: This is my opinion on the movie, as someone who was actually born and brought up in Dhaka. I was offended by how they represented my city, and I want an apology from Netflix.",

A black-market mercenary (who has nothing to lose) is hired to rescue the kidnapped son of an imprisoned international crime lord. But in the murky underworld of weapons, dealers and drug traffickers, an already deadly mission approaches the impossible.This movie was very enjoyable to watch although personally, I think that at some points, the silence lasted for too long.

Reason Bangladeshi drug lord can't say Bengali accent properly (mainly Bangladeshi accent). Isn't that funny? And other Bangladeshi characters saying Kolkata accent. I mean why? No problem with any characters face they all look like Bangladeshi the problem is accent. Before release i was very happy because watching Bangladesh in a Hollywood film was a proud moment but after watching the film i was very disappointed and as a Bangladeshi i couldn't connect myself with this film and for me its a very average movie. 3 out of 10. Lets see what happened in the sequel. Hope it will be better than this one.",

Though I think they could've avoided playing Bollywood songs in every other corner of the apartment building action sequence, that too in Bangladesh. It felt like a bad attempt to attract Indian audiences.The movie seemed to lack character development and plot development. It just focused on the action sequences which were brilliant and made you feel like you're watching a good shooting game. The film gets somewhat repetitive towards the end. You can only watch so many people getting shot without turning out to be numb and somewhat exhausted by it. Also, the film opens with a shot from close to the end of the film and It doesn't work however because there is no intrigue behind it. This was one of the few poor choices for an otherwise good action film. I would recommend giving this one a watch especially if you like action movies and games.",

            "content": "Mild SPOILER ALERT!This is your average hollywood action movie. A guy is hired to rescue a hostage and deliver him to safety but faces hardels after hardels which leads to a big blow off and explosions in the end. So, if you have watched action movies before then this ticks all the boxes. The \"hero\" is a mean killing machine, good in fist fights and knife fights, has the ass kicking persona built in. But unlike your typical movie he doesn't have a cool one line that you can quote, never comes face to face with his antagonist and doesn't rides on into the sunset with a harley davidson.As i said if ticks all the action movie signature moves. It has good action sequences, good cinematography and a simple plot. The focal point of the story is set to be in Dhaka, Bangladesh but due to filming restriction shooting was done Ahmedabad, India. But even with that restriction the locations resembles Keraniganj, Kaliganj, Basila which are three towns across the Dhaka City across the Buriganga River. I think the direction deliberately meant this as in the big blow off scene in the end is set on a bridge on top of a river (hint at Buriganga and Babubazar Bridge). So A for effort. The acting was good too.What is a disappointment (if you are a Bangladeshi) in the movie is the portrayal of the local armed forces. Yes, there are plenty of corrupt Police, RAB (branded Elite in the movie/the guys in black) who work under several political leaders and but involving the Army in the end (i think the direction meant to show the paramilitary force Anser who are always under the Police but got the color schemes wrong and turned them into the Army) is too ridiculous. Two men shooting their way past all of these forces is a bit too much even for action movies as we are not in the 80s anymore.Another down downfall on the movie is the Bangla accent. The language of Bangladesh is correct but the accent is far off. In the beginning it seems everybody speaks Bangla like All British Born Bangladeshis but in the end the accent takes a sharp turn and turns into West Bengal accent. If you are someone from any other country you wouldn't mind, but to us it's a bit cringe.So, taking everything into consideration\na) was this movie enjoyable? - YES\nb) would you recommend this? - Probably YES\nc) could it have been better? - YesOverall grade: B",

But let's just assume that it is a fictional Dhaka. Let's talk about the actual film.\nThe script is so poor, the movie was going to no where. Character development is so bad. We don't see anything that would help us to connect to the main character throughout the movie. The direction is soo bad (Except for the action scenes)\nDirector used the camera as mere capturing device. Even in an emotional scene, there was no camera work that would be visual storytelling.\nChris Hemsworth acting was so bad in this movie. He just had one or two expressions, and he carried them all along. No effort.\nBut kudos for the character played by Randeep Hooda. His character was better written than others and he acted so well. Way better than Chris.\nThere are people who are saying atleast the action is good. Yes, I agree. But movies are not only about action scenes. There's a reason why the universe of Cinema is so gigantic. You have no right to ridicule that grandness just by saying \"Atleast the action scenes are good\"",

There are two major accents of Bangla/Bengali, Bangladeshi accents and Indian accent. Clearly Bangladeshis dont speak in Indian accents but all these character who have spoken the language, used indian accent. Bollywood songs were playing in the households which is not a thing in Bangladesh.\nThey said Dhaka is surrounded by rivers, which is not totally true. Also there are jungle in the outskirts of the city they said, in reality there are none. Also a kind reminder that this movie highlights the control of a drug lord over the country as he can even manage the armed forces which is a joke. Because drug dealing and drug business is a lot less in bangladesh even less than usa, or other developed countries. Drug is not an issue here. An all powerful drug lord is far from reality. Nearly impossible stunts are at its best which makes me laugh while watching. Also the yellow filter seemed disturbing.",

I know a lot of people is saying, it's just a movie. But still, you should at least do some research before making a damn movie. Why on earth the military of Bangladesh would work for a drug dealer.

            "review_title": "Another action movie lost its plot..!!",
            "content": "Sometimes the smallest detail can trip up your experience of a movie. Forty minutes into Extraction, Tyler (Chris Hemsworth) and Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) are dodging gunmen in a Dhaka building. They break into an apartment, and the famous intro to Didi Tera Dewar Deewana plays. They alight a floor, 10 seconds pass. Then, from another apartment, we hear snatches of Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna. What are the chances that two instantly recognisable songs from two of the most famous Hindi films of the '90s are playing at the same time in present-day Dhaka? If this were set in the US, an equivalent scene would be Tyler rushing past one apartment as Rick says \"Here's looking at you, kid\" and another as Kane says \"Rosebud\". Not impossible, but unlikely.\nTyler does get Ovi out, but his escape from Dhaka is ruined by Saju's double-cross and the local police closing all exits at the behest of Amir. The film's big setpiece is a very long one-take sequence in which Tyler kills his way from the streets into a building and out again, a terrified Ovi boy tagging behind. Zero-cut extended action is no longer a novelty for moviegoers, but it's still an impressive trick if handled with some wit and variation. Tyler's bloody progress, though impressively choreographed, becomes somewhat monotonous - he moves and executes his kills like a soldier, all precision and no personality.\nIts action may not spark much joy but when Extraction settles down for a quiet moment, that's when you're in real trouble. Not content with giving Tyler a formulaic tough guy backstory - his life falls apart after his six-year-old dies of cancer - the film also makes rich, unhappy Ovi, unloved by his own dad, the perfect candidate for a father figure. \"He thinks of me...more like a thing than a person,\" he says, unburdening to a complete stranger who just killed several dozen people and hit the one person he knows with a truck. Later, Ovi tells Tyler, \"You drown not by falling into the river but by staying submerged in it\", because that's how Hollywood thinks 14-year-olds in India talk.\nExtraction is written by Joe Russo, and is produced and based on a story by him and his brother, Anthony, co-directors of four Marvel films. The source material, a graphic novel, is set in Ciudad del Este, Paraguay - the film simply swaps one third world country for another, as American movies tend to do. It's disappointing that the Russos, coming off the success of the last two Avengers films, would choose to put their weight behind yet another attempt to turn white protagonists going on a killing spree in foreign lands into some form of soul-searching. Tyler is treated like a gentle soul in torment, despite his frequent reminders that he is a killer for hire.\nThe film doesn't have any interest in Dhaka - it could be any dirty, corrupt city where Bangla (and some Hindi) is spoken. The one local character of note - Amir - is translated for Western audiences as the Pablo Escobar of his city. Extraction is by no means a realistic film, but it is set in the real world, which means the Russos can't fall back on comic mythos or easy utopias like Wakanda to explain its blinkered politics. Its white characters, also gathered in a poor country with the express purpose of killing its citizens, probably think of themselves as heroes too.",

Bangladesh film industry has much better actors for the villain's role, at least 1000 times better than the chick shown in the film who could've easily easily helped the director to portray a 'Dhakaiya drug king'Roads, Dusts, Slums are from Kolkata and Kolkata suits best for all those, directors could have easily used Kolkata as it naturally goes with the movie.Most importantly, Dhaka's elite forces (Police, RAB, Army follows the command of a Drug king \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02)\nWhat a Joke...!! Could've easily used thousand random gang members of the drug dealer in place of those uniformed clowns who actually resembles national defence of a country.What was the point of highlighting and developing plot surrounding Dhaka and Bangladesh where almost nothing matched exactly.Tyler and co. went all in for just money, rescued, came to know that they were played & won't get paid, his dead son comes in mind and rescues for the humanity \ud83d\udc4f\nWhen his own son died, his humanity didn't rise, he escaped so that he doesn't need to watch his son dying in-front of him. So, getting the air of Dhaka he became a good 'mercenary'? This part even destroyed the overall weights of the Tyler's character.Successfully wasted my times watching this and now reviewing this as well.My rating is 4/10 only for Chris Helmsworth & Randip Hooda's inhuman efforts. Rest all are 'rotten tomatoes'",

            "content": "Just watched the Netflix special \"Extraction\" starring Chris Hemsworth. I am extremely disappointed with the HORRIBLE misrepresentation of Dhaka. Dhaka AND its law enforcers deserve a MUCH better portrayal in front of the world. Reasons below (no spoilers on the storyline). #ExtractionIsNotDhaka1. Children don't carry rifles on the streets of Dhaka in broad daylight. It's a horrible misrepresentation shown in the movie. If I didn't live in Dhaka myself, I would be mistaken into thinking child terrorism is normal in Dhaka.2. Law enforcers in Dhaka - whether it be DMP, RAB or any of the defense organizations - are NOT incompetent and incapable of stopping two random guys flying in from outside the country. They do their job well, which is why we can go out, visit places, hang out with friends and more without worrying about random shootings (like they show in the movie).3. Dhaka's streets are NOT violent and it's NOT normal for people to fight in public with guns and swords. The movie made it seem like the people are used to things like these happening and somehow it's the norm here.4. An entire movie set to be in Dhaka and not a SINGLE major Bangladeshi character played by someone who SPEAKS the language and dialect that we do in Bangladesh? Are you for real, Netflix? All the major characters spoke Bengali like they do in West Bengal / Kolkata - NOT how we speak in Bangladesh - although they were representing characters in Bangladesh. Why? My mother was an actress, a lot of my friends are too. I'm sure many Bangladeshi actors could do those roles better than any of the ones who did, WHILE speaking our language/dialect.Overall, it's a horrible misrepresentation of the country in front of the world by a cast which isn't even 1% Bangladeshi. People abroad don't know a whole lot about Dhaka, but after they watch this movie, they might get the wrong impression that Dhaka lacks law enforcement and is filled with violence.This is not my Dhaka, this is not any Dhaka",

That's how drug dealers work? Using legitimate assets and banks? What about the warehouse full of cash lying around as always shown in the movies?\nAnd why would a drug dealer kidnap the BROKEN opponent's kid? Where is the ground for the kidnapping? Or just for fun? How the kid is transported from Mumbai to Dhaka? Using a chartered plane or ship or by road or how?Pankaj Tripathi played an Indian Drug Dealer. Using him for less than 5 mins seems an insult for the actor's caliber as he's an astonishing actor and known for playing a cool headed bad guy in Indian film & television industry. He could have been of much use as either opponent or a strong character in the movie.\n(the_rajasthani_Wanderer)\nWhich role did Randeep Hooda play? Is he a partner with the kid's father or security or something else. In case he played a security officer's character then the writer must have been drunk while writing his character. The only introduction to the character's abilities are from a photograph dressed as army personnel, no other description.But, Randeep gets full attention in his weak role also, even if he attacks Rake after rescuing the kid from goons.\nIf his character \"Saju\" is so brave, intelligent, can travel to Dhaka and fight a bunch of mercenaries then why didn't he thought of rescuing the kid instead of hiring Rake as mercenary when he knew there is no money to pay him. His involvement with the rescue would have been known to the opponent anyway.What about the opponent Bangladeshi drug dealer? What's his contribution to the film other than wearing nice suits, sitting around, speaking nonsense and sipping drinks? And he illegally ties up with a Colonel from Bangladesh Army? Man, it gets worst and worst towards the end.Golshifteh Farahani's character, Nik Khan, handles the team but no tactical experience or decision making in critical situations. The only memorable is her expressionless face.Chris Hemsworth justified his character elegantly and played it very well but details about the character are so vague that I failed to grasp character's motives till the end. The stunts are nicely coordinated and stimulates goosebumps while watching. But, his friend who owes Rake his life, betrays and tries to kill him. Pity on the character for having such a friend.I've seen many Hollywood movies but the lowest grade director from Hollywood may have a better shot of getting nice reviews than Extraction's director.Seems, the film is a waste of talented actors like Chris Hemsworth, Pankaj Tripathi, Randeep Hooda and many others.It could have been a great movie by Chris Hemsworth as a producer.\nBut, the screenplay writers and the director killed the film with lack of knowledge about South Asian cultures, Geography and people's behaviour.\n.\nby ---The Rajasthani wanderer",

            "content": "The premise of the movie was supposed to set in Dhaka, a city of 10+ million people in Bangladesh. Unfortunately, they completely missed mark making the set in Dhaka.To start with, the accent of the locals are wrong, they are speaking in an accent that's commonly used in West Bengal, India. Dhaka and People in Bangladesh, in General, have a completely different accent. Throughout the movie, Hindi songs are heard in the background, where everyone is watching tv during midday. People go to work here, Dhaka is the capital, nobody sits on their asses watching TV midday. Bangladesh has its own music industry, although the movie had some issues acquiring copyright for some of the songs to play in the background.The environment is wrong. Sure Dhaka has slums and dirty places, but most of the city is developed enough with an actual nice road system. If they set the scene somewhere else in Bangladesh, it would've been more convincing. The roads are basically dirt roads in this movie where Dhaka has one of the best road systems in the Country. Dhaka doesn't have that kinda dense jungle anywhere near the city, certainly not near the Buriganga river.The criminal class in Bangladesh is completely different. This isn't Africa, people don't employ child soldiers here. And certainly carry AK-47 in hand and in the open.The Police uniform and looks are completely misjudged. They are trying to portray the elite force of Bangladesh, Known as Rapid Action Battalion. They are not regular police. The deal with counter-terrorism and similar stuff. It should've been the police that deals with criminal or action in the street. Police vehicles are wrong.Don't get me wrong, the entire movie is brilliantly shot and exceptionally action-packed. But this provides a complete misrepresentation of Bangladesh, as well as the city of Dhaka. People who don't have an idea about Bangladesh will get a false sense for a beautiful country by the misrepresented set of this movie.Reviewed by oritroahmed",

This movie tries different things, in terms of the suicidal element of our protagonist, and the streamlined plot which contains an interesting half way point with David Harbours character.\nI would say this movie suffers from undeveloped characters, including Harbours, Farahinis and the boy with the scar. I didn't understand if Farahini was a love interest or just a close relationship, either way it wasn't expanded upon. The boy with the scar isn't interesting enough to be the person who kills Tyler, and as a viewer it did nothing for me, as Tyler seemed very content with dying, he had accomplished the mission and I'm assuming he comes back to life in the final shot.\nWe all have hours to kill so you may as well spend 2 of them watching this.",

Main Strength in this movie is its action, the performance of lead actor Chris Hemsworth and supporting actor Randeep Hooda in action department were very good, specially a hand to hand combat scene between Chris and Randeep was worth watching. But the main drawback in this film is its average storyline and weak screenplay it fails to engage the audience for the whole two hours. Technical aspects like VFX is also good but I feel adequate reasearch was not done on Dhaka city because at some scenes of the film we hear old hindi songs in background but Dhaka is a bengali speaking city. Acting performance of Chris Hemsworth, Randeep Hooda and Rudraksh Jaiswal were very good but the performance of Priyanshu Puniyali who plays the main antagonist in this film was not upto the mark.

Tyler easily accepts this task and sets out to accomplish this mission backed by his team member, Niz.\nThe film starts with the climax scene where Tyler is shot, making us wonder whether the movie would live up to the hype and expectation.\nThe moment Tyler reaches Dhaka, Bang Bang, the action starts, the hand to hand combats, Knife fights, guns, bazookas, bombs, helicopters, sniper. Tyler has all the firepower one man would ever need to fight a country.\nThere are some emotional moments in the movie. amid Ovi's rescue mission when he tries to look back at his life, he realizes his father treated him like a possession more than his son and in this process ends up knowing Tyler's story where he learns about his 6yr old son who is no more. There is a certain bond that develops between Ovi and Tyler.\nThe USP of this film is action, action and nothing but action and is so well directed that it is difficult to comprehend this is Sam Hargrave's directorial debut. Sam Hargrave is a stunt coordinator at Marvel Universe and it comes as no surprise that he strapped himself around the car with a camera and said action. The scenes between Tyler and Saju are a treat to watch. A scene where Tyler and Saju fall from the balcony straight on to the road and the way the camera follows them will keep the audience gasping for breath.All in all, this movie is a treat for action junkies, it will surprise you with stunts u would have never seen before, the fights look very real and is very fast paced.\nExtraction is based on a book called Cuidad.\nThe film's working title was initially Dhaka but was changed to Out of the Fire and finally, the makers settled for Extraction.\nThe shooting took place in Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Thailand.",

It calls for a question on authenticity, right?? I myself, an Indian, don't think that Bangladeshis listen to Hindi Music that much..!Nevertheless, it doesn't take away the fact that the Indian Angry man Randeep Hooda fought exceptionally well to take his role at per with Hemsworth..\nIn parts, it felt like this film is targeted to the Indian audiences, it's like the producers knew what could trigger us to like and watch this film..hat's off Russo Bros and debutant director Sam Hargreaves for this fantantic marketing strategy..\nNothing more to say but I guess this film with it's 'ifs' and 'buts' delivers a popcorn and relaxing treat in these tough times and Kudos to the creators for that..And Special mention must be the precious Bengali spoken by Chris Hemsworth i.e. ''Proman Dao'' ( Show me the proof)..That was shockingly hilarious..!!",

            "content": "We see a Bangladeshi drug lord kidnap an Indian crime lord's son and Tyler is unleashed to extract him from Dhaka. But why the big names of the subcontinental criminal underworld came to this rivalry, why these desperate measures are unclear.\nAnother problematic thing is the portrayal of Bangladesh's law enforcement agencies. Every agency including the police, a fictional force named \"Elite\" which looked like Bangladesh's Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), and even the Bangladeshi military were portrayed to the worldwide audience that they were controlled and bribed by Dhaka based international drug cartels which is fictional but still problematic.\nIt paints a picture to the world that Dhaka is like Medellin in Colombia during the Pablo Escobar era which is far from true.\nThe screenplay could have supported some residents or law enforcement officers who were not criminals or involved in drug rings to balance this but every scene of Dhaka felt very wrongly portrayed.\nThen comes the main issue of the whole film, the Indian actors who played Bangladeshi roles. Not a single one of them was talking Bangla in a \"Dhakaite\" accent or even a Bangladeshi one. Some Indian actors were completely butchering the language and most Dhaka based characters in the film sounded like they had a West Bengal based accent and pronunciation. Bangladeshi netizens were quick to respond to this error and complained that the producers of the film did not give attention to the language at all and how no one in Dhaka speaks like the way these characters in this film do.\nThe creators of the project should have kept in mind that Bangla language is the quintessential element of Bengali identity and they are the only nation who had given their lives for their mother tongue. So a faulty dialect of this language will become a sensitive issue for the Netflix users of this country.\nAnother huge issue was the acting of the kidnapped kid Ovi, played by Indian actor Rudraksh Jaiswal. As one of the lead characters of the film and having a huge screen time his acting weakness bores the viewers. Most of his dialogue deliveries are typical Bollywood melodrama and in some scenes beside Hemsworth he seems redundant and ridiculous.\nThe Bangla language and Bangladeshi people, more accurately Dhaka's residents, were not accurately portrayed in Extraction. Yet it marks the beginning of an era where the stories of the capital of this small nation are being told by the Hollywood infrastructure to the whole world for the very first time on this scale. Events like these are important for Bangladesh and its filmmakers to create the urge in them to craft such stories on a massive scale for the global audience; stories which will be the accurate representations of the rich history, heritage and diversity of our beloved Dhaka.",

People are complaining about lack of story, lack of character development etc etc. But that's the risk the creators take on purpose.\nDo you really think the people wouldn't have thought of these things, I think we should judge the movies based on what they want us to see not based on what we actually want from them.This movie keeps you on toe for more than 50% of the time. The fight sequence choregraphy lies in on level of some of hollywood Blockbusters. People rating this movie 1 - 2 are really nuts. As a movie lover i feel bad when people do this to some movies, because it has impact on larger audience reading those reviews.A lot of hardwork has been put into the movies and we should atleast give the credit for what the creater and the team behind these project deserve rather than follishly nitpicking.What i absolutely love about the movie.\nCameraworkFight SequencesDirectors dedication to stick to the Raid style action flick.What could have been improved.\nFew less fillers and more depth should have been given to the sequences about past of characters of Chris and Randeep Hudda.I am not conflicting about what i have said above about asking for other take on the movie. But the time which was already allocated for sequences where Randeep Hooda calls his family and the interaction between Chris and Kid at night.\nI think those scenes could have been more better with better writing.Bur overall, this is a great movie. I loved it from Beginning to End.",

            "content": "Extraction.Some Indian actors completely butchered the language and most Dhaka based characters in the film sounded like they are from West Bengal\nAs Covid-19 lockdown continues in Bangladesh, every film lovers' eyes were on Netflix this Friday as they dropped their latest original film Extraction starring Hollywood superstar Chris Hemsworth. The whole country was eagerly waiting for the action-packed film since the Thor famed actor shared images from the shoot on the set of the film on his official Facebook page in November, 2018.The backdropAmerican action thriller Extraction, previously titled Dhaka, was greenlit back in 2017 by Netflix and is the directorial debut of famous Hollywood stunt coordinator Sam Hargrave. His titles include Hunger Games and several action films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The screenplay was written by Joe Russo, based on the comic book Cuidad by Ande Parks, Joe Russo, Anthony Russo, Fernando Leon Gonzalez, and Eric Skillman.The film is a co-production between Avengers: Infinity War (2018) directors Joe Russo and Anthony Russo's (commonly known as Russo brothers) independent production company AGBO and Netflix. The lead cast Hemsworth is also one of the producers in the project.The film was mainly shot in India's Ahmedabad and Mumbai in November 2018 and some shots were taken in Thailand and Dhaka, Bangladesh.The film's production began in Ahmedabad and Mumbai in November 2018.The plotTyler Rake, played by Chris Hemsworth, is a fearless black-market mercenary who is hired to rescue Ovi, played by Rudraksh Jaiswal, the kidnapped son of an imprisoned Indian crime lord. The kidnapping was done by a Dhaka based international drug lord which pushes Tyler into a deadly and almost impossible mission to Dhaka to save Ovi from the drug lord and his massive force of goons and bribed law enforcement members.The rightsExtraction takes its audience from Dhaka to Mumbai to Australia and back, giving us a picture of the interconnected drug traffic ring in South Asia. The two-hour-long film is dark and raw from start to end and every action film lover's dream.Not even a single action sequence of the film was ever exactly shot in Bangladesh except some plate shots for establishment, including the iconic action sequence at Sultana Kamal bridge near Demra.Chris Hemsworth never set foot in Dhaka yet the audience felt he was blazing his guns around Old Dhaka. All of the shots were taken in Ahmedabad and Mumbai.Hats off to the production design team behind the project who had done an excellent job of recreating Old Dhaka in Ahmedabad with such attention to details from the vehicles, to posters in streets, to every single sign board of each shop in each sequence.Russo brothers and Hargrave visited Dhaka couple of times but as Dhaka is not a very production friendly city, they just shot some establishment shots.As the director and producers of the project are the masterminds behind the Avengers franchise, not a single action sequence will let the audience down.\nThe long yet fast paced follow shots during the action sequences are a treat to experience.Hemsworth gave his absolute best playing the role of a hired black-market mercenary.The wrongsExcept for the smartly handled production design choices, action packed fight sequences, and Hemsworth's Asgardian god like charms nothing else really works in the movie. The screenplay is poorly written and lacks emotion. Though this is a spoiler free review yet there is really nothing more to the story line. The film feels like a two hour long fight sequence with some bandage breaks like a PUBG match on your phone.We see a Bangladeshi drug lord kidnap an Indian crime lord's son and Tyler is unleashed to extract him from Dhaka. But why the big names of the subcontinental criminal underworld came to this rivalry, why these desperate measures are unclear.Another problematic thing is the portrayal of Bangladesh's law enforcement agencies. Every agency including the police, a fictional force named \"Elite\" which looked like Bangladesh's Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), and even the Bangladeshi military were portrayed to the worldwide audience that they were controlled and bribed by Dhaka based international drug cartels which is fictional but still problematic.It paints a picture to the world that Dhaka is like Medellin in Colombia during the Pablo Escobar era which is far from true.The screenplay could have supported some residents or law enforcement officers who were not criminals or involved in drug rings to balance this but every scene of Dhaka felt very wrongly portrayed.Then comes the main issue of the whole film, the Indian actors who played Bangladeshi roles. Not a single one of them was talking Bangla in a \"Dhakaite\" accent or even a Bangladeshi one. Some Indian actors were completely butchering the language and most Dhaka based characters in the film sounded like they had a West Bengal based accent and pronunciation. Bangladeshi netizens were quick to respond to this error and complained that the producers of the film did not give attention to the language at all and how no one in Dhaka speaks like the way these characters in this film do.The creators of the project should have kept in mind that Bangla language is the quintessential element of Bengali identity and they are the only nation who had given their lives for their mother tongue. So a faulty dialect of this language will become a sensitive issue for the Netflix users of this country.Another huge issue was the acting of the kidnapped kid Ovi, played by Indian actor Rudraksh Jaiswal. As one of the lead characters of the film and having a huge screen time his acting weakness bores the viewers. Most of his dialogue deliveries are typical Bollywood melodrama and in some scenes beside Hemsworth he seems redundant and ridiculous.ConclusionThe Bangla language and Bangladeshi people, more accurately Dhaka's residents, were not accurately portrayed in Extraction. Yet it marks the beginning of an era where the stories of the capital of this small nation are being told by the Hollywood infrastructure to the whole world for the very first time on this scale. Events like these are important for Bangladesh and its filmmakers to create the urge in them to craft such stories on a massive scale for the global audience; stories which will be the accurate representations of the rich history, heritage and diversity of our beloved Dhaka.\nCourtesy:\nSiam Raihan,\nDhaka Tribune.",

The maker literally didn't do any homework about the locations, as a result, Poor and fake locations.3rd: The actors who played the characters of Bangladeshi people, they can't speak Bangla at all; their accents are like a joke for more than 210 million Bangla speaking people around the world.4th: The movie yellow color makes it worst to watch peacefully, it seems like we are watching Mexico with the name Dhaka.5th: The funniest part of the movie and most appreciated part of the movie is its actions.

I would accept this kind of action if Thor did it instead of Tyler Rake.Overall Extraction is another poorly made Netflix exclusive, which will nobody remember.",

Not that I had high expectations from this movie but I wanted to see how the city I grew up in is portrayed in a commercial Hollywood movie.Honestly, the movie got multiple things wrong. Here are some of the few things I found annoying and at times, offensive.Horrible Casting: The supposedly Bangladeshi characters of the movie suspiciously talk in a Kolkata accent, 2-3 other characters including the guy that plays the mafia boss speaks with a north Indian accent. Not only the accent was annoying to listen to, the words and phrases they used are never used by real Bangladeshis in such contexts. This makes me wonder; why Netflix with it's multi-million dollar budget could not afford 5-6 actual Bangladeshi actors to play those Bangladeshi characters.Unrealistic paramilitary force: They showed a group of paramilitary force in black uniforms as Bangladesh's main law enforcement agency in this movie. This agency I guess is meant to be a fictionalized version of RAB( a local paramilitary force). The unlimited arsenal and firepower they are showed to have, it would make even the US military envious. This included police chase cars, helicopter, bazookas and other sophisticated military weapons, which I, living in all those years in Bangladesh have never seen.Mafia controls everything: The antagonist in the in the movie, Asif Amir, who is a mafia boss/Narcos style drug kingpin seem to control everything in Dhaka. The army, police, and 'Elite' - everything seems to be in his pockets. While Bangladesh is a highly corrupted country, it is factually incorrect to show that a druglord runs the city.The filmmakers used the Mexico style Druglord-kidnap-Corrupt cop formula on this movie. They totally missed the point that the politics in Latin America and the Indian Subcontinent are very different. Using the same formula would only make for a horrible movie such as this. Very disappointing job from Netflix. Hope next time they do better research before making a based on a culture they don't know much about.",

The lighting is amazing,it was cinematic and soft,my favorite scene was the scene where Tyler rake and Ovi mahajan were having the conversation In the room,that lighting is the best in have seen in recent times,I just want to kiss the lighting team.4. The sound,so sweet,I mean,the scene where Tyler,ovi and the police men where moving from room to room,the music choices and the feel was so nice,I loved the sound experience.5. The editing and color grading was so nice,I felt the emotion in every frame.6. I loved the boundary reach,the audiences they would get will be great,because they told their story and made a great film,I loved the fact that the camera stayed on some shots and enhanced on the use of children in crime in some societies,I really felt that.7. Now the casting And acting,how do you manage to get it all right,I am so thrilled,well you did your home work. Every character worked,the stunt was great,I loved the use of pain,I mean the mirror shot where Saju fixed his nose \ud83d\udc43 ...aaarrrrgh\n8. The art department,I mean set,costume and makeup department,the special effects,thank you,you did a great job.9. I noticed they had 23 producers,23 Assitant directors just to mention but a few,all I saw was collaboration team work and shared profit.I am excited,super excited,if you have made a feature length film or let's say,a short film,then you will appreciate every frame that you watch\ud83d\udc4f",

However Netflix always seems to fall short on the most important part of any film, the plot. Not that the concept isn't interesting but on execution, as with all Netflix films, there is more that could've been done.The films main failure for me was the CGI, it really took me out of the film at points, the main example when the truck flips and is engulfed in flame. The phyiscs simulation is off and the fire effects are lacking quality, also at other points in the film with smoke being used to signal where things are taking place, there is a blatant lack of blending with environment so it just sticks out against a very yellow colour palette.Not to say this film isn't enjoyable, there are some amusing moments where the film takes a step back from the seriousness it tries to convey and allows a chuckle here and there.I will conclude by saying there were also some cool camera transitions but something more couldve been done in the edit trying to hide some cuts as they were fairly blatant even on a first watch.",

They just tried to make the scenes epic by moving their cameras like crazy instead of letting the actors actually act.\nOverall, if you are looking for a good or maybe OK movies, it's not a movie you want to watch.",

However, the plot of the film is very basic and remains one - dimentional throughout its duration but the film still manages to hold your attention quite well.\nThe story of the film revolves around the son of India's biggest drug dealer who has been abducted by the gang of the drug lord of Bangladesh as they are not on good terms. A mercenary named Tyler(@Chris Hemsworth) has been hired to safely bring him back home. Beside the basic plot, there is hardly anything which gives the depth or twist to the story. Also @JoeRusso's writing has some flaws as the film gives less space for character development. Film has some loose ends and a very outdated portrayal of Bangladesh by showing weak Military, inexpert Special Forces and child terrorism to justify action sequences.\nThe screenplay is full of hardcore & mindblowing action sequences and you can see lots of violence happening throughout the movie. The combat scenes are brilliantly choreographed and the climax sequence is a major takeaway.\n@ChrisHemsworth is in his top form and delivers with such an ease. @RandeepHooda as Saju is equally good and it's a delight to watch him in a never seen before avatar performing such high octane action sequences and all other starcasts have also delivered decent performances.\nBackground music works well. The cinematography is amazing. The camera work, one-take-shots are seriously fantastic.\nYou can definitely give it a watch. Thankyou",

And the Bengali accent used in the movie was West Bengal's one, would have been much more better if they replicated Old Dhaka or atleast Bangladesh's Bangla accent properly. The Indian cast was a bit weak in the acting part, but they tried. The story lacked details of the timeline and many other things too. Loved the action scenes.

Though it was all filmed in Kolkata but the every it represented Dirty Kolkata, Traffics are mainly indian car/cng covered with Dhaka painting. Dhaka is far clean & modern than Kolkata. In an action scene, every household showed listening Hindi Songs which is not even real in Kolkata.

Apart from something which makes a movie a complete entertaining package, My heading says many issues which are as follows:\n1. Bangladesh (BD) is country of 16 crore +...So, you understand how much it will be in terms of movie viewers number. The movie portrayed BD like Syria, Afghanistan or a war wrecked State which is disgrace for us. Because BD is not such.The stuntman (Director) should have some background studies which hadn't. Because he is a stuntman!\n2. He couldn't portrayed our law agencies properly and made whatever just he liked.\n3. He could not portrayed Dhaka. Because he tried to do it from Ahmedabad, India.\n4. There is distinct difference between the Bengali language of BD & India as it's between US & UK English language in terms of pronunciation. Someone apart from Bengalis may not understand it. The stuntman tried to establish Indian Bengali language as BD Bengali language with lot of spelling mistakes of Bengali language which made the background as unrealistic one.\n5. It's obvious that the Stuntman took idea from Someothers not from BD to portray BD as he didn't come here. This made the blunder and has defamed my country.\n6. You will need a microscope to find out a man having 4 wives in BD. It may be possible in Middle East. But it's reflected in the movies.This is how he tried to defame BD muslim culture.Thereby I am grading this movie 1/10.",

Movie casting was very good. Chris Hemsworth, Randeep Hooda , the kid everyone showed their skills while the director completely lacks his. It is not DHAKA AT ALL. I really doubt if they have seen the city even by google.\n2. \" Sultana Kamal Bridge\" is way ahead from Dhaka city.\n3.The accent heard in background seems absolutely wrong- I have never ever heard of this accent enywhere in Bangladesh for the last 36 years - I am also wondering how it occured.\n4. Bollywood songs in background (which is also pretty old, like 90's) might confuse the viewer as well. We have our own music.\n5. Children were shown in the street carrying guns and using foul languages- really? Which Dhaka is it?\n6. Finer detail- the city environment, bakcground activity, vehicle models used for the movie- nothing matches Bangladesh even- let alone \" Dhaka City\".Bottom liine-\nThe movie lacks its context completely. Dhaka is a peaceful city.\nOvercrowded ? - yes.\nHeavy Traffic ?- yes\nAir Pollution ? - yes\nNoisey? - yes\nBut it is vibrant in its own way- much safer than many cities of the world. We can find child begger in the street - but definitely not terrorist.I suggest anyone related to this movie should type \" Dhaka\" in Google or Wikipedia. They have more information - especially authentic one.I sincerely apologise for my comments above if it hurts anyone. Any city shown in any movie should reflect its own character - imagination shall be there for sure- but definitely not out of context .",

The violence is quite excessive though.I understand people feel offended how Dhaka is portrayed and that it isn't realistic. But honestly, it's a movie. It's almost never accurate. How many times don't you see Hawaii, while the movie is supposedly set in South America for example. Or you're supposedly watching a scene in Amsterdam, while it's a square in a different country.

            "content": "Good Things About the film:1. Direction is just flawless. The American Stuntman turned Director Sam Hargrave just nailed it. He knows how to do action scenes without disrespecting Newton. He made the Pace fast where needed and slowed up where it called for one simple conversation between characters. Just incredible.\n2. Performances of most of the characters. Chris Hemsworth AKA Thor didn't let us down and delivered An impeccable performance. His sense of every emotion is just amazing. He makes you feel every time he goes through some emotion. And when he pronounces \"Proman dao\" so flawless you'll just feel that One is dubbed but no. He Said it. But he said \"teka\" instead of \"taka\" but it seemed that he learned bengali from a Bangladeshi instead. Overall a \"Worth it\" performance.\n3. Shataf Figar as Bangladeshi Army Colonel was just on point. He didn't mispronounced a single bangla word wrong. And his presence and personality was just extraordinary. He did look like a real colonel.\n4. An extraordinary performance came from Suraj Rikame as Farhad. Though his role was very short but very very important. He was the finding of this film. His \"on point\" expressions and greatly pronounced bangla makes his performance a great one. He has a Bright future.Bad things about the film:1. I didn't like particularly just disliked the performance of One character is of Rudraksh Jaiswal as Ovi Mahajan in this film. His expressions were Same at every scene. He just disgraced Chris's performance. May be he was baffled a little bit in front of \"Thor\". But in comparison Suraj Rikame just stole the show as an teenage antagonist. Only one dialogue that strikes was \"You drown not by falling into the river, but staying submerged in it.\" but it was only the dialogue, Not the way he delivered it.\n2. Particularly didn't like the pronunciation of bangla words by Priyanshu Painyuli as Amir Asif. He was just a typical north Indian speaking bengali after few classes. I mean seriously? In that level you can't do that he should have been replaced by an bengali actor from Bengal or Bangladesh either. Very disappointed with that as a bengali.\n3. Story line was predictable after the first half.\n4. Pankaj Tripathi was used only in one scene. They couldn't capitalize on his master class.\n5. The Director seriously needed More homework about the music taste of Bangladeshi people obviously. Because, you can hear only Bollywood songs (Most of them are SRK songs from 90's and 2000's and From Gully Boy too) playing in households while a chasing scene. I mean seriously? You could have added a \"Khairon lo tor lomba mathar kesh, Chirol daanter hasi diya pagol korli desh\" instead. They did add a bangla rap in a car scene though (Not \"Ripon Miyar Bangladesh\" though).(Quick facts: All the Dhaka scenes were shoot in India only. Australia scenes were shoot in Thailand. AND THERE IS NO MANOJ TIWARY IN THE CAST. GOOGLE SHOWS IT WRONG WHEN YOU SEARCH FOR \"EXTRACTION CAST\".)Should You Watch It Or Not?\nAbsolutely. You should watch it. It is a great portrayal of South Asian Under world and also a Gunman's emotion weaknesses about his Son and the consequences of that you would Not expect. Oops! Spoiler. So, if you have enough money in this lock down period and going to subscribe to Netflix for this film, then go ahead. I mean, Umm.... I prefer Torrent. though.",

            "content": "The premise of the movie was supposed to set in Dhaka, a city of 10+ million people in Bangladesh. Unfortunately, they completely missed mark making the set in Dhaka.To start with, the accent of the locals are wrong, they are speaking in an accent that's commonly used in West Bengal, India. Dhaka and People in Bangladesh, in General, have a completely different accent. Throughout the movie, Hindi songs are heard in the background, where everyone is watching tv during midday. People go to work here, Dhaka is the capital, nobody sits on their asses watching TV midday. Bangladesh has its own music industry, although the movie had some issues acquiring copyright for some of the songs to play in the background.The environment is wrong. Sure Dhaka has slums and dirty places, but most of the city is developed enough with an actual nice road system. If they set the scene somewhere else in Bangladesh, it would've been more convincing. The roads are basically dirt roads in this movie where Dhaka has one of the best road systems in the Country. Dhaka doesn't have that kinda dense jungle anywhere near the city, certainly not near the Buriganga river.The criminal class in Bangladesh is completely different. This isn't Africa, people don't employ child soldiers here. And certainly carry Ak-47 in hand and in the open.The Police uniform and looks are completely misjudged. They are trying to portray the elite force of Bangladesh, Known as Rapid Action Battalion. They are not regular police. The deal with counter-terrorism and similar stuff. It should've been the police that deals with criminal or action in the street. Police vehicles are wrong.Don't get me wrong, the entire movie is brilliantly shot and exceptionally action-packed. But this provides a complete misrepresentation of Bangladesh, as well as the city of Dhaka. People who don't have an idea about Bangladesh will get a false sense for a beautiful country by the misrepresented set of this movie.\n579 out of 948 found this helpful",

There comes the whole disappointment. Not as a Bangladeshi but as movie freak I am saying this. If you are showing a part of city it is okay to portray as however one wants but if the whole city is portrayed it should be taken into consideration how it should be portrayed. In this movie whole Dhaka is shown as slam/dirty area with narrow lanes which is definitely funny and ridiculous. Yes it is over populated but the whole city is not based on old buildings and narrow lanes or smelly sewer. Only the part of old town has old buildings with narrow lanes.* Dhaka is not a post war country and children do not run with guns in open streets, they dont even carry guns in a hidden manner and they are not part of gangs for sure.* Even if it is considered the whole armed forces are corrupt in a country but what about the background story for that one? I don't know, they might have plan to produce another movie for the past story.\nIn movie there is no local showed to help the character Tyler or Saju which is actually a serious negative side according to me. For Saju how he entered inside Dhaka without help form someone how he crossed border with arms and without security people knowing that is a mystery.* We all know the difference of English accent between UK and USA, what if a movie story is based on USA and the actors portraying USA locals are using UK accent, how horrible does that sound?\nSame has happened in this movie (Except these two character: Dhaka Elite force Commander and Farhad), even the character portraying Dhaka Drag Lord, Amir Asif cannot speak proper Bangla, how funny is that?) The other actors portraying Dhaka goons are using West Bengal accent (Part of india, Bangla is their mother tongue too) which is too much different than the actual accent of Bangladeshi one.*Then comes background songs used in the scene.\nAll the songs played on background are Hindi (Might have been copyright issues but there are too many West Bengal produced Bangla Music?)\nSeriously? this is the research of a movie team!!!!",

Raw, visceral, brutal and realistically shot with real world stakes. The centrepiece action sequence, a one-take shot that moves from a car chase to a building shootout to a knife fight to finally a truck chase, is a marvel! Chris Hemsworth excels and so does Randeep Hooda and Rudraksh Jaiswal.\nBOTTOMLINE : If you're a fan of action movies in the same vein as of John Wick, Raid or Atomic Blonde, do give this movie a chance.

Dhaka AND its law enforcers deserve a MUCH better portrayal in front of the world. Reasons below1. Children don't carry rifles on the streets of Dhaka in broad daylight. It's a horrible misrepresentation shown in the movie. If I didn't live in Dhaka myself, I would be mistaken into thinking child terrorism is normal in Dhaka.2. Law enforcers in Dhaka - whether it be DMP, RAB or any of the defense organizations - are NOT incompetent and incapable of stopping two random guys flying in from outside the country. They do their job well, which is why we can go out, visit places, hang out with friends and more without worrying about random shootings (like they show in the movie).3. Dhaka's streets are NOT violent and it's NOT normal for people to fight in public with guns and swords. The movie made it seem like the people are used to things like these happening and somehow it's the norm here.4. An entire movie set to be in Dhaka and not a SINGLE major Bangladeshi character played by someone who SPEAKS the language and dialect that we do in Bangladesh? Are you for real, Netflix? All the major characters spoke Bengali like they do in West Bengal / Kolkata - NOT how we speak in Bangladesh - although they were representing characters in Bangladesh. Why?Overall, it's a horrible misrepresentation of the country in front of the world by a cast which isn't even 1% Bangladeshi. People abroad don't know a whole lot about Dhaka, but after they watch this movie, they might get the wrong impression that Dhaka lacks law enforcement and is filled with violence.This is not my Dhaka, this is not any Dhaka.PS: This is my opinion on the movie, as someone who was actually born and brought up in Dhaka. I was offended by how they represented my city, and I want an apology from Netflix.",

Chris Hemsworth does a wonderful job of portraying a battle-hardened mercenary who has hit rock bottom due to a personal tragedy.\nThe plot is set up well and gets you emotionally invested in the characters. The indian actors are great in their roles, especially Rudhraksh Jaiswal who plays the abducted child and after the first action sequence I thought \"Wow, this is gonna be fun\".\nHowever what ensues is an ongoing shootout in which our main protagonist mows down countless members of the local police. The justification of that being that their commander is corrupt and in the pockets of a drug lord.\nAnd that just throws me completely out of this story. Since when has it become a heroic act to slaughter public servants? I just can't get behind that and it makes the redemption story of Tyler Rake pointless in my opinion.",

(from story by)\nFernando Le\u00f3n Gonz\u00e1lez ... (with illustrations by) (as Fernando Leon Gonzalez)Stars: Chris Hemsworth, Bryon Lerum, Ryder Lerum and etc...StoryLine:-In an underworld of weapons dealers and traffickers, a young boy becomes the pawn in a war between notorious drug lords. Trapped by kidnappers inside one of the world's most impenetrable cities, his rescue beckons the unparalleled skill of a mercenary named Tyler Rake, but a Rake is a broken man with nothing to lose, harboring a death wish that makes an already deadly mission near impossible.Chris Hemsworth was perfect for this role. this movie is full of action sequences that's why He doesn't have to do a lot of speaking. The stunts were awesome and not very easy.The acting of every starcast was perfect which makes me feel good. As this was an action thriller movie you see guns, bombs, shots every time so keep away children from this film. Otherwise, I enjoy a lot to watch this film. I rate this 8 out of 10.I remove one point for its location and another one as the film does get a little tedious towards the end. I recommend you giving this one a watch.",

So I was excitedly waiting for this movie just like everyone else here.All the forces of the entire country working for a drug lord and getting beaten by two guys is fine. Kinda incorrect picturization of Dhaka is acceptable too. But children carrying AK-47s in daylight is way too much. Everyone knows aliens don't really invade NY once every year. But not a lot of people from outside know Dhaka or Bangladesh. This misrepresentation is disappointing. And not a single character speaks good enough Bengali with a Bangladeshi accent. There is no Bangladeshi character you feel a human connection to. The whole nation is like a kidnapper in this movie.Good actions and acting though. Might have liked the movie if I was not Bangladeshi and didn't speak Bengali.",

Do you think that would play well with American audiences? Seeing New York's finest, their wive's and kid's world about to implode with grief, mowed down by some African foreigner rescuing a Mexican druglord's kid?

It's just lazy, it's an easy way to throw cannon-fodder for more explosions and bursts of gunfire. Maybe some people can see past that and just enjoy the spectacle, but frankly it left me cold.

            "content": "During self-quarantine I'm sure many of you like myself have been abusing the time watching content on the many streaming services available to us. I've been lucky enough to dedicate this time to catching up on some of the latest releases on Netflix.If you're looking for a good action film to enjoy on late night then you'll be satisfied with Chris Hemsworth's latest project - Extraction. The film is based around the character Tyler Rake, an ex pay for hire mercenary, who takes up one last job; to rescue an Indian mob leader's kidnapped son from a rival mobster and the largest drug dealer in Bangladesh. Expect spectacular fighting sequences, explosions and exhilarating car chases as director Sam Hargrave takes us on the whirlwind mission in his debut film.Given Hargrave's stunt background (famously known as Captain America's stunt double), there was a lot of potential for the action sequences to bring this film to life. We see glimpses of Hargraves talents shine, in particular, during a fight scene that takes place once Rake attempts to recover mob leader's son Ovi. The close combat flights are captured well, we feel the intensity of the fight through the shoes of Rake. The director wants us to feel every punch and kick which engages us as the audience. Hargraves stunt background definitely adds an edge to this film, he is able to satisfy us the audience through the intense fighting and excessive violence, similar to that used in the Asian action films such as the Raid.With the majority of the film being shot in Dhaka Bangladesh, one of the most densely populated cities in the world; Rakes task seems even more unrealistic as he is one man in foreign country against an entire mob. Hargraves does well at using this location to create chaos. In particular, during the car chase we feel overwhelmed and on the edge of our seats as there's people everywhere and often a lot of near misses. However, what stood out to me during this scene and the fight scene was the camera. Hargraves repeatedly uses a one shot, similar to that used in 1917. This shot is effective as Hargraves is able to make us feel like we're following Rake through the chaos.Although, this film doesn't stand out from its competition in the action genre. It feels like Hemsworth is attempting to solidify himself as a solo lead by creating a lane for himself. perhaps for when he decides to hang his boots as the role of Thor within the marvel cinematic.",

First is the language, if you want to make a film a a countries background you can't show all the native people talking in some other accent. Here in this film all the supposed Dhaka residents always talking in an accent that is of West Bengal, India, not anywhere near Dhaka. Then the roads, houses and songs! yes you heard right, songs. Roads are dhaka are not like shown in the film, dart roads, so when you watch the film you will feel this is not dhaka at all. The houses are not like dhaka. In the film you can hear hindi film songs from 90's in almost every house. Sadly the film is not set in 90's background but today. And in Dhaka you will not hear 90's hindi song in souses or cafes. So altogether this film does not give a single bit of felling that it's in Dhaka, then why using the name anyway? I understand that being a fantasy film this does not require to be accurate but you can't get all wrong. I feel like the director never did much study on Dhaka before making this movie, otherwise why a Director debut with a film which can be called, \"The Action of Errors\"But having said that, If you love solid breathtaking nonstop action and Chris Hemsworth then this movie is enjoyable none the less. After all, how many of us remember a city from a movie after several months?",

The least you could do is pick actors from Kolkata (they have a great film industry and many great Bengali actors).

It's just an action movie with a context of being shot in Bangladesh. Obviously they had to bring in fake police, combat squads etc guessing the Real Police of Dhaka won't have given directors the chance of bringing in that much action\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06.

Unfortunately, they completely missed mark making the set in Dhaka.To start with, the accent of the locals are wrong, they are speaking in an accent that's commonly used in West Bengal, India. Dhaka and People in Bangladesh, in General, have a completely different accent. Throughout the movie, Hindi songs are heard in the background, where everyone is watching tv during midday. People go to work here, Dhaka is the capital, nobody sits on their asses watching TV midday. Bangladesh has its own music industry, although the movie had some issues acquiring copyright for some of the songs to play in the background.The environment is wrong. Sure Dhaka has slums and dirty places, but most of the city is developed enough with an actual nice road system. If they set the scene somewhere else in Bangladesh, it would've been more convincing. The roads are basically dirt roads in this movie where Dhaka has one of the best road systems in the Country. Dhaka doesn't have that kinda dense jungle anywhere near the city, certainly not near the Buriganga river.The criminal class in Bangladesh is completely different.This isn't Africa, people don't employ child soldiers here.And certainly carry Ak-47 in hand and in the open.The Police uniform and looks are completely misjudged.They are trying to portray the elite force of Bangladesh, Known as Rapid Action Battalion. They are not regular police. The deal with counter-terrorism and similar stuff.It should've been the police that deals with criminal or action in the street. Police vehicles are wrong.Don't get me wrong, the entire movie is brilliantly shot and exceptionally action-packed.

Worst representation of Dhaka, Army, police, vehicles, environment & official bangla fonts on vehicles & arms forces are missing, people's clothing, houses, wrong bangla accent not even close but why? Everyone is listening Bollywood song for no reason where tons of popular bangla songs can be played instead. The movie completely missed the environment of Dhaka city. Maker tried to portray a more African-looking city with dirt roads and barely developed neighborhoods, while Dhaka city is a Metropolitan and quite well developed, they should have chosen some India's other continents or African countries would have been apt..... where you will have a drug hub, police underworld, children with gun.

So it really matters for Bangladeshis.2.There is no such drug lord. Movie shows that the drug lord has huge power to order POLICE and ARMY. But here is the fault. No where we have seen a small cadre, soldier for drug lord himself. Drug lord should have a trained staff to fight with Chris.3. Under aged people have been used by Drug Lords. Oh! The story had a chance to utilize those under aged in beautiful way.4. Such Drug Lord does not exist. It should be well known to the educated people in the world that South-East Asian (Bangladesh, India and Pakistan) cannot be drug lord because of their environment, history. This sub-continent had been dominated by Afghan, Iranian, Tatar, European.5. The dress is not appropriate. Police, Army, Background color, Transport.6. Words are written incorrectly. 'Army/Police Force' was spelled/written in the arm badge as 'Army/Police Fose'.7. One Indian songs was used well. But others are not appropriate. Because it is drug/action/thriller movie, it does not mean that only hip-hop songs will be used. Sometimes, a slow music creates a rhythm. It is just like the scene where Chris jump from the hill/mountain after relaxation. It was beautiful and enjoyable.8. Where is Bangladeshi Actor? Come On! You have no idea how good they are. Because you do not know any actors does not mean there are no actors. You are going to make a movie in Bangladesh, find the right person.9. Netflix!!!!! Poor choice. If I had to spend such amount, I would have used properly. You have released this movie by doing same manner the Bangladeshi producer does. The producers spend 10% time before making movie, 10% after making movie, 50% in making movie, and remaining time they enjoy their movie-making news in media.All the best.",

As a Bangladeshi, I beg to differ. As a action story mostly set in Dhaka, the movie accurately portrayed the setting in Dhaka. There's a few minor mistakes however. For example, the Bengali spoken is most that from West Bengal. Bangladeshi spoken Bengali is quite different. There's also a sequence in a jungle near the outskirts of Dhaka, but Dhaka is an urban area and is surrounded by other urban areas.As for the story, there are some plot holes. There's no clear motive that establishes why the kid was kidnapped. It's also ambiguous as to why the kid decided to start Chris Helmsworth's character blindly. There's also some awkward camera angles, but that could be forgiven as a directorial debut. The production design, stunt coordiation and visual effects were superb.

The Film is based on a Graphic Novel 'Cuidad' by Andre Parks which is originally set in Paraguay. Wondering who thought it was a good idea to send a literal 6\"3' inches Avenger in the streets of Bangladesh where his only job is to blend in to survive. Like the film falls apart at how shallow the writing is. It goes all over the place. New characters pop up for as long as a minute and then they vanish. I think Extraction is blindly trying a 'Bad Man turned Good Man but with a kid to save' troupe Terminator 2(1991) and Logan(2017) and failing at it.

We play indian song its true but not all time. You guys should have studied about Bangladesh and should have made a Bengali team before filming the movie to make more real. This movie is looking like that the hollywood representing only Indian lifestyle where a major part based on this movie in Bangladesh. I know there were most scenes filmed in Ahmedabd, India but it would not be problem to us if you manage the Bengali environment same exactly Bangladesh exists.\nYou guys absolutely ruined Bangladesh in this movie, it's hurt everyone in Bangladesh.\nHowever, we Bangladeshi's wish to be careful these logical issues next time when you shoot in Bangladesh in other movies.",

            "content": "A PURE ACTION SEQUENCE\nExtraction has a very short story which can be expressed in a line: a young boy is kidnapped; a mercenary is sent out to rescue him.\nThat boy is Ovi Mahajan (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the son of a jailed Indian drug lord (Pankaj Tripathi). The one-man rescue operation is Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth).Ovi was kidnapped by Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli), Bangladesh's biggest drug lord, who also controls the country's police and military,in Dhaka. Ovi, who lives in Mumbai with his father's underling, Saju (Randeep Hooda) who was in Indian Special Forces before,who knows a team that can bring the boy back to India.Tyler reaches the kidnapper's den: we get a longish violent showdown. Ovi and Tyler manage to escape: we get an even longer action set piece. The climax is expectedly more violent, where all the characters converge with an assortment of weapons.In the worst sceniario when things get complicated,all the world want Tyler to leave Ovi in Dhaka to save himself,he ensures Ovi that he will leave Dhaka only with Ovi though he will not get the money as he does not want to loss another child's life after losing his own child who was died by cancer.From then it was purely action sequence like car chasing in congested areas of Dhaka,fighting with cops,escaping from the guards etc with very limited story line.Based upon rural areas of Dhaka,it shows the effective power of Drug lord on the country's Security forces,Child labour including training them with varieties of heavy weapons from very young age to be extremist.From here on,someone attacks, someone counterattacks, someone monitors and plans.Screenplay by Joe Russo was good though the shots were too yellowish to show the impact of the rurality of Dhaka.When it comes to individual performances,Chris Hemsworth was outstanding at action sequences,dialogue delivering(specially those Bengali word \"Proman Dao\").The boy(Rudhrash) was equally good in screen but Randep Hooda as Saju was exceptional,his dedication towards the whole screenplay was fabulous,he hardly has left any fault to criticize.However for a pure entertainment and Action sequence adventure,You can surely give it a watch.",

First of all, the movie was not shot in Dhaka, Bangladesh. And then, a Bangladeshi army general obeying the command of a drug lord is something that never happened and will never happen. It's alright to show Chris killing a bunch of soldiers in the movie, but an army general in Bangladesh never obeys a drug lord since the army and the government is stable (not like what is portrayed in some Hollywood movies with plots in African countries). It was funny listening to the Indian actors talking in Bangla with Indian/Kolkatan accent. And old hindi songs playing in the alleys is what you'll see in India, not in Bangladesh. Dhaka is the center of the country with a large military base and the prime minister and all government officials residing there. So, Chris carrying out his mission in the center and the heart of the country is unimaginable. Also, crossing the bridge to hand over the kidnapped child seemed to be the main task at the end. It's hilarious that the army could only attack from one end of the bridge, and the other end is open in the center of the city. Stupid plot, but great action.",

So when there is a fight in the road in Dhaka city, there should be a big gathering. And Bengali's don't listen to hindi songs in the day, they have works to do. And finally children aren't given Rifles, Shotguns or Pistols in Bangladesh. They mostly got knives with them. In this case you guys should have the casting to some adults who is 17-18+. After all directing and story was good.. I am really disappointed in the Dhaka, Bangladesh fact",
