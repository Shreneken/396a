            "content": "Has there ever been a bad performance in a Guy Ritchie movie? If there has I haven't noticed it. He has an ornate ability to take average actors and make them great, and to take already great actors and get even more out of them. There are a few directors around who specialise in this but Ritchie is right near the top. The cast in 'The Gentlemen' is admittedly fantastic, but it doesn't change the fact that they are an absolute treat to watch. Matthew McConaughey is in his element in a role that he was born to play, Charlie Hunnam plays one of the coolest characters I've seen perfectly, Colin Farrell is hilarious and ridiculously cool as well and then Hugh Grant gives one of the best performances I've ever seen from him. In fact Grant was so good I didn't even recognise his voice and had to wonder if they'd dubbed it. They hadn't, he'd just nailed it.The style this movie possesses is just so much fun to watch. If you've seen any of Ritchie's previous similar films ('Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', 'Snatch', 'RocknRolla') then you know what I'm talking about. The pacing moves at lightning speed, the dialogue is quick, clever and deeper than you first realise and the conflict is always multi-layered. This one is actually told in quite a unique way with a couple of characters going over events that have already happened and it works masterfully. It breaks the story up and gives room for creativity in the story-telling process and also humour.Every time I see that Ritchie has made a movie that isn't a crime-thriller I get a little disappointed. It's not that the other stuff he's doing is bad ('Swept Away' being an obvious exception), it's just that he is so damn good as this style of movie. He's the best in the business and if he only did these for the rest of his career I'd be a very happy man. This is an excellent movie well worth your time and money.",

            "content": "Aside from a few very marketable films like \"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows\" and \"Aladdin\", Guy Ritchie is a writer/director who makes incredibly violent films. That is, incredibly violent films which are also brilliantly constructed and near perfect. While I rarely ever watch violent films, I eagerly look for his next dark British crime film, after seeing his \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" and \"Snatch\"....and so it's not surprising I'd see \"The Gentlemen\". And, like these other films, it's near perfect...and a film you ought to see if you have the stomach for this sort of story.So this leads me to a huge warning. This is NOT a family-friendly film nor one you want to show your mother or Father Jenkins if he stops by for a visit. There's ample cursing, loads of violence, vomit galore, and the story is about bad people...very bad people.The story is complicated...and goes together like a finely crafted puzzle. It concerns a marijuana czar in Britain, Michael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) and his desire to sell out and retire to a life of ease and sophistication. However, after making an offer to a rival drug kingpin, suddenly everything goes haywire....folks start dying, farms growing the stuff are hit and an all-out war seems inevitable. There's WAY more to the story than this...but since it's so complex, it's best you just see it to appreciate it.The bottom line is that Guy Ritchie can write and direct amazing films...and this one is truly amazing and entertaining. Apart from his misguided vanity project, \"Swept Away\", his output has been impressive and I cannot stress enough what a quality product this film is. My only MINOR quibble is what about the Russian mobster.....what happens with him? This isn't really dealt with in the film and seems a bit like a dangling plot point.",

I haven't seen Aladdin, but it was succesful sort of. But this is right up his alley! This is pure and enjoyable Guy Ritchie, with timeline cuts and jumps and characters that one may think only he can write.It's so great to see Matthew McConaughey joining the ranks, being a substitue for Jason Statham I reckon. But also having Hugh Grant in this ... role/character. Genius! Who'd have thunk it, and he kills it (no pun intended). At least a few twists will be easy to spot, but I don't think one can guess everything. Even so, the movie is so well made, it won't really matter. If you like the genre, this is the one to watch. Fun and thrilling to the end ...",

He offers to sell his business to a fellow entrepreneur for \u00a3400,000,000, but other people in the illegal fun trade have their own agendas.Guy Ritchie has returned to his early themes of violence, chaos, and rock&roll from his early career, and has scored a definite hit, with some fine performances, including a blank-faced one by Charlie Hunnam and an outsized comedy turn by Colin Farrell. Hugh Grant does well as the unwanted on-screen narrator of events, putting them into some order; I am impressed by his lack of a posh accent, event as I wished Ritchie had been able to think of a better way of telling the audience the story.Even with that cavil, the unceasing action and insanity kept me more than interested throughout.",

            "review_title": "A ruthless first-class kick in the teeth!",
            "content": "The rather unconventional visionary Guy Ritchie has been stuck in a Hollywood rut for the last ten years, ever since he committed to big budget, visual effects heavy films, such as Sherlock Holmes, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword and this year's underwhelming live action version of the classic Disney, 'Aladdin'. The British director goes back to his roots with the highly entertaining gangster film 'The Gentlemen' and surprisingly nails every bold punch he makes.Although his 'Aladdin' made a ton of money, critically the film was a disaster. His return to the underground world of bribery, drugs, money-laundering and blood-covered-class, is as refreshing as it is entertaining. The film's script deals with two storylines at the same time, almost breaking the fourth wall with a tongue-in-cheek commentary on today's Hollywood and how big movie studios are hungry for some original yet overly mainstream basic content, to lure people into cinemas to go watch their films.Beginning with a quick flash forward that ends with a bang and a pair of brains splattered all over a pint and a pickled egg at a typical British pub, we dial it back to a quiet evening at Raymond's (Charlie Hunnam) cosy house. When private investigator and intrusive sly fox, Fletcher (Hugh Grant), turns up at his house, he explains he has been keeping an eye on the different gangs around town for quite a while. Narrating most of the film and making some stuff up to make things more spectacular for himself, he reads his mostly finished movie script to Raymond, bribing him into funding his little project, or else he'll leak all the information he has on Raymond's boss Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a white trash American expat who has build himself a marijuana empire.Mickey is tired of the business and is trying to sell his highly profitable company to a dynasty of Oklahoma billionaires. But when one of the underground weed-plantations gets raided by a group of British lads, filming the entire thing and posting it on YouTube as some sort of fight--music-video, it quickly becomes clear some mobster bosses haven't been exactly honest about their meetings and loyalty towards each other. This is when the real war begins - while keeping it classy.Ritchie co-wrote the story with Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies, who haven't written anything before. The idea of the entire film is prodigious, but the screenplay and dialogue is simply unprecedented by Ritchie himself, bringing joke after joke, while taking you on a thrilling ride full of genius twists and new ways to incorporate classic gangster cinema - Ritchie-style. Composer Christopher Benstead is debuting his very first score for a feature film with The Gentlemen, and knows exactly how to set the tone and drive it up to an eleven. A promising talent that won't go unnoticed.Ritchie introduces new characters throughout the film, keeping the audience on the edge of their seat, surprising them with actual cinema, getting the best angles and money shots, thanks to his cinematographer Alan Stewart (Aladdin). When adding layer after layer to the story, going deeper into the underground scene, adding a new protagonist who's into human trafficking and Mickey's queen and wife, the cockney Cleopatra, Rosalind (Michelle Dockery), who owns a sanctuary for the ladies as some sort of business coverup to her husband's weed-empire, it becomes clear every role has a purpose and there are no extras involved in this story. One of the best acting ensembles in recent cinema history, and a welcome reminder from McConnaughey as to why he won an Oscar in the first place. But it's Colin Farrell (as the highly entertaining 'Coach') and Hugh Grant who steal every scene they're in with their remarkable wit that'll for sure land them some BAFTA-nominations.'The Gentlemen' is a ruthless first-class kick in the teeth. Do not let the failures of Ritchie's recent career choices scare you, as this is actually one of the best films he's ever made. Who knew Guy Ritchie could raise the bar not just for himself, but for everyone out there trying to brush him off as a has been. 2020 is off to a great start!",

All the performances are excellent. I can't fault this movie in any way. Maybe it isn't the bestest movie evar, but I can safely say it will be one of the best of 2020.Charlie Hunnam is legitimately scary. McConaughey nails his role.

            "content": "This is a typical Guy Ritchie movie, there is a story, it isn't always easy to follow, but style is even more important. Matthew McConaughey is American Mickey Pearson who went to England as a young man on a Rhodes Scholarship. He soon learned that he had a knack for selling drugs to fellow students and that eventually blossomed into his vocation on a very broad scale. Now in middle age has decided to sell his marijuana empire, which included a dozen well-hidden farms, and retire to a leisurely life and maybe have a few rug rats with his beautiful and devoted wife. The price? Just 400 million British Pounds.As the news of that gets around a number of shady operators want to get their cuts from a number of devious means. So the movie is mainly about that and how Mickey and those loyal to him devise methods to protect him and his investments. The cast includes a number of well-known actors and the roles are uniformly interesting.This is a good movie for those who appreciate and enjoy this type of British underworld movie, there aren't really any characters who are good people, there are just different degrees of badness.I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped, not her kind of movie.",

            "content": "Any Guy Ritchie film I've seen, he always delivers, especially when he's writer and director. This one follows in the tradition of \"Rocknrolla\", \"Snatch\", and \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\", the story layered with multiple sets of gangsters trying to outdo each other for the grand prize at the end of the flick. I got a kick out of the opening scene in which the bartender pouring Michael Pearson's (Matthew McConaughey) pint pulls down on the bar tap handle reading 'Ritchie Sewing Company', a self promoting piece of business I found pretty clever.This one doesn't seem to be as hard to follow as the earlier mentioned films. All of them prompted a second viewing to catch all the nuance of the characters, but this one, even with the chronology going back and forth, was pretty straightforward. That's probably due to the format, essentially a narration of events by journalist Fletcher (Hugh Grant) relating his investigative work to Pearson's right hand man, bodyguard and driver Raymond (Charlie Hunnam). Colin Farrell's character is simply known as 'Coach', and he's drawn into the story by virtue of his gangsta underlings botching a take down of one of Pearson's weed farms. What could have been an ancillary character winds up being central to the outcome of the story.And just about when you think it's over, another twist occurs with the introduction of a Russian oligarch and his mission of revenge for the death of his son. All the while you have to wonder how the picture's principal character, that would be Pearson, manages to come out of the story intact, considering all the bad guys who want to do him in. It's a fun watch if you go for this kind of stuff, made all the merrier by the script's creative use of the English language. You know, maybe I will watch this all over again.",

            "content": "In Love Actually, Hugh Grant, who coincidentally also lends his acting talents to The Gentlemen, tells a group of reporters: \"We may be a small country, but we're a great one too. (The) Country of Shakespeare, Churchill, The Beatles, Sean Connery, Harry Potter, David Beckham's right foot ... David Beckham's left foot come to think of it.\"Well, in my opinion, he forgot to mention Guy Ritchie, who is known for his gangster films Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000) among others, as well as the Sherlock Holmes' films of 2009 and 2011. With The Gentlemen, Guy Ritchie goes one step further in proving himself a national treasure of our friends the Brits.With the help of a cast comprised of big names and lovable favorites such as Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant and the inimitable Colin Farrell, as well as an intelligent, engaging and entertaining script, Guy Ritchie once again comes through in delivering sumptuous fare for the eyes and ears and heart. Here, Mickey Pearson (McConaughey), is a powerful American marijuana dealer based in England whose plan it is to retire and sell off his marijuana empire for a cool \u00a3400 Million to spend more time with his wife. As can be expected, more than a wrench is thrown into his plan. What ensues, is giddy entertainment a'la Chef Ritchie's Specialty of witty, super-fast, intelligent, humorous exchanges and more than a few sleights-of-hand by a gallery of engaging and colorful characters who are thrown into numerous subplots, countless twists and turns, betrayals, confrontations and several inevitable revelations.Sounds confusing 'duneh it'? It isn't.Sit back and enjoy the rich mischievousness with which this is all served and rest assured that Ritchie is a master. With a deft and artful hand and sure command of his narrative threads, he has fun rearranging the linearity of the story (which if attempted by anyone else might be confusing), and delivers something close to a masterpiece.8.7/10",

Some might see this as a backwards step, but in my opinion, it's what he does best.This time around, the ace in Ritchie's hand is Hugh Grant, who brilliantly plays pivotal character Fletcher, a tabloid reporter who tries to blackmail powerful drug lord Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), threatening to publish an extremely damaging story if he doesn't receive a payment of \u00a320m within 72 hours. The film unfolds as Fletcher tells Pearson's right hand man Ray (Charlie Hunnam) the story of how he gathered the dirt on his boss. Grant's performance is pure genius: playing against type he is seriously sleazy and frequently hilarious.Not that the rest of the cast are any slouches: Hunnam is cool and badass, Colin Farrell displays a keen comedic touch as tough gym owner Coach, McConaughey is his usual affable self (but with a seriously dangerous edge), Michelle Dockery impresses as Pearson's spunky wife Rosalind, and Jeremy Strong holds his own as the criminal who wants to buy Pearson's marijuana operation. Even the minor characters are great as well, from the Coach's grime-loving lads 'TheToddlers' to the obnoxious housing estate yoofs who give Ray's 'muscle' the runaround.Ritchie's writing and direction is possibly his best yet, the script sparkling with wit and the visuals both stylish and confident. The dialogue is extremely funny (and loaded with expletives), the violence gloriously OTT, and the characters memorable. It might be a case of Ritchie 'playing it safe' by revisiting familiar territory, but when the result is as entertaining as this, why the hell not?",

            "content": "The Gentlemen is a return to the London gangster milieu where writer/director Guy Ritchie first made his name with films such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000). His first foray into this territory since the disappointing RocknRolla (2008), The Gentlemen comes at the end of over a decade making big-budget studio-backed crimes against cinema. Granted, the film seems stuck in the last decade in more ways than one, it's highly questionable that the only gay character is a slimy S&M proponent who'll sleep with pretty much anyone, its token female character barely even manages to rise to the level of tokenism, and Ritchie does absolutely nothing new here - if you've seen Lock, Stock or snatch., you'll know pretty much exactly what to expect - but The Gentlemen is still hugely entertaining. Most of the jokes land, the dialogue is as sharp and expletive-laden as ever, the cast are having a ball, and the self-reflexivity, although a little forced in places, works well for the most part. And yes, the plot is as derivative as it gets, but there's no denying Ritchie has injected real verve into what looks on paper like an inconsequential C-movie. The Gentlemen definitely won't change your life, but it will make you laugh.The film begins as sleazy private eye Fletcher (Hugh Grant) arrives unannounced at the home of Ray (Charlie Hunnam), right-hand man to Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a suave Oxford-educated American ex-pat who controls a huge marijuana empire in London, valued at around \u00a3400 million. Several months prior, Fletcher was hired by tabloid editor Big Dave (the great Eddie Marsan) to dig up dirt on Pearson with the aim to ruin him - Dave's revenge for Pearson blanking him at a gala. Fletcher has written a screenplay based on his investigation (titled Bush) and tells Ray that unless Pearson pays him \u00a320 million, he will hand over everything he has to Dave. Meanwhile, Pearson has decided to sell his whole operation, but when word gets out, all hell breaks loose, as the various interested parties vie for advantage. Most of the subsequent film takes the form of Fletcher narrating his exploits to Ray, explaining how he learned so much about Pearson and what he does. Along the way, we meet characters such as Rosalind (Michelle Dockery), Pearson's ruthless and unflappable \"cockney Cleopatra\" wife, who runs a garage with an all-female staff; Berger (Jeremy Strong), Pearson's preferred buyer; Dry Eye (Henry Golding), the ambitious but brutal scion of a Chinese syndicate, who hopes to undermine Berger; Coach (a scene-stealing Colin Farrell), who runs a boxing gym for troubled youths and who inadvertently finds himself in the middle of everything; a plethora of property-rich-but-cash-poor landed gentry who are essential to Pearson's empire; a Russian oligarch; and a street gang called The Toddlers.Aesthetically, The Gentlemen is very much in the mould of Ritchie's previous gangster movies. Because Fletcher frames his narration as a screenplay, it allows Ritchie to employ a multitude of self-reflexive devices - a smash cut coinciding with Fletcher asking Ray to visualise a smash cut; voiceover transitioning into spoken dialogue; on-screen captions telling us who's who; animated maps; YouTube fight porn (don't ask); freeze-frames; rewinds; a shot of film running through a projector etc. At one point, Fletcher is discussing the merits of anamorphic (2.39:1) over 1.78:1, and the film's aspect ratio changes accordingly. At another, he's arguing for the merits of 35mm celluloid over digital, saying he likes the grain of celluloid photography, and the film duly switches formats. Such playfulness means that it never for a second takes itself too seriously, with probably the most self-reflexive moment coming towards the end, when we visit Miramax's offices in London (Miramax produced the movie), and we see a poster for Ritchie's The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015). All of this is immensely fun, with the more you know about the mechanics of assembling a film, the more humorously self-reflexive the film becomes - Fletcher even acknowledges his own role as an unreliable narrator.In terms of themes, the most obvious is something Ritchie has examined before - the idea that the economic divide between gangsters and aristocrats masks their practical similarities. Pearson straddles this divide; he's a gangster, but so too is he an aristocrat (in all but name), and the smooth running of his business depends on both classes - the aristocrats who he needs to grow his product (for reasons that constitute a bit of a spoiler, so I'm not going to get into it) and the gangsters who distribute that product. The clash between the pompous insularity of the English upper class and the perceived uncouthness of the lower class has been done to death in both literature (Wuthering Heights (1847) springs to mind) and film (Performance (1970), for example), and although Ritchie doesn't say anything even remotely new about it, it still forms an interesting textural background - gentrification is ever-present; there are ironic references to the posh areas of Croydon; Ray, a working-class Newcastle native, is a cleanliness freak who eats wagyu steak and lives in a mansion, and when he's dispatched on a mission to an uncivilised working-class area, he explains he \"just hates them junkies,\" seeing them as very much his social inferiors.One of the most central scenes sees a group of obnoxious privileged teens holed up in a council flat, whilst on the street below, a gang of machete-wielding delinquents terrorise the neighbourhood. As Ray and his men clash with the gang, there's a real sense of old vs. new - traditional gangsters fighting it out with internet-savvy hoodlums who don't give a damn about tradition or respect. There are a lot of laughs to be had with these issues, such as Ray and Coach having problems pronouncing the name Phuc. And again, none of this is presented as even remotely serious.The biggest problems with the film are probably its lack of depth, and the familiarity of the presentation, characters, and milieu - there's nothing here you haven't seen in previous Ritchie films. And as you would expect, there isn't much in the way of emotional maturity or narrative complexity. It's all very surface-level, and it makes no apologies for such.Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed The Gentlemen. It's a funny as hell caper and the actors are clearly having terrific fun. It might be formulaic and overly familiar, but it's also immensely enjoyable.",

Written and directed by Guy Ritchie this has all his trademarks: gangsters as the good guys (and bad guys), clever, gritty plot with some great twists, great tongue-in cheek humour. It is a tour de force by Ritchie and, as much as I love Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch and RocknRolla, is his best work.Not only does the film play to Ritchie's strengths it also feels less formulaic than his usual gangster-crime offerings. While he is good at what he does, his plots do feel a bit repetitive at times. This, while still falling in his usual arc, has an originality about it which is quite refreshing.All this is helped by a star-studded cast - Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant, Colin Farrell, Eddie Marsan - none of whom put a foot wrong. Hugh Grant is almost unrecognisable as the slimy journalist: a great departure from the shy, nerdy roles he is known for.Highly recommended.",

            "content": "I wanted to like this film. But I just couldn't. It wasn't comedic to me. And it didn't strike a cord of being a real-life engaging thriller to me either. It's very stylized. And although style can work in certain circumstances when the viewer is appropriately brought on-board. I felt like the plane left without me. A style really doesn't work if the characters become too artificial while trying to play-off an essence of reality at the same time.Much of the story about the main character (McConaughey's) is delivered as investigative conjecture from another character(Grant's). So as the narrator character reveals the main character's story, the narrator can later change the result of events we perceive by just revealing that the conjecture he presented before was inaccurate. This gets old really fast.Maybe this can work if the conjecture is absurd and funny or if the conjecture rings very true most of the time. That way it surprises the viewer when it's revealed to be wrong. But as I explained before, I didn't overall get a sense of either quality within the story-telling.Overall the film seemed very ambitious. But all of the pieces didn't seem to quite make sense to me together. And they might have been better off removing a few elements for this particular script.I wasn't too sympathetic for the characters I was supposed to be sympathetic for. I didn't understand the logic to some of the character decisions. Some of the moments of \"big reveals\" didn't seem too surprising to me. And a lot of the narration got annoying to me. More often than not it's better to show than tell the viewer what they need to know. I didn't think the voiceover was helpful in showing but telling. To put it simply, I felt it was more style than more substance. And the music didn't seem to help the storytelling to me either.I hope you like it if you see. But I also hope that if you have similar concerns and inclinations as me, that my review might spare you some time and/or money. I know I wish I had stayed away from this one.",

            "content": "I've enjoyed a good portion of Guy Ritchie's filmmaking. While many of his more recent movies rely on franchise appeal (Sherlock Holmes (2009), The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015) and Aladdin (2019) are of note), I usually associate his style of filmmaking with the British heist film (like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000)). Consequently, I was looking forward to seeing his recent film, The Gentlemen (2020), as it seemed to be a return to the kind of filmmaking that attracted me to Guy Ritchie films in the first place.Unfortunately, it seems Ritchie has been away from his core movies for so long that he's almost forgotten how to make them. The meta framing with Hugh Grant and Charlie Hunnam was clunky enough that even Hunnam's character was getting bored with the \"telling\" in the exposition provided by Grant's character. Sure, there were a few neat twists here and there, but it was trying so hard to be a meta-movie like Seven Psychopaths (2012) or The Player (1992) that it lost its focus. In the end, it spent too much time trying to interweave the narrator's narrative and the story narrative, and all it ended up with was a jumbled mess of a movie.I didn't feel like the action or cinematography (two elements that defined Ritchie films in the past) was lacking. This was mostly because so much of this movie is told to us via Hugh Grant. Perhaps this was also because the meaningful action didn't even end up being real, but rather the imagined \"movie version\" of events that played so counter to the characters and how they would act as to break the suspension of disbelief. I'd forgive doing this once, but it seemed to happen on more than one occasion, resulting in an annoying \"just kidding\" wink from the narrator far too often. At the very least, The Gentlemen does show the difference between boys trying to be tough and men who are actually tough.A Guy Ritchie film that tries, and fails, to reignite the magic from his first movies, I give The Gentlemen 2.5 stars out of 5.",

While no 'Snatch' or 'Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels', it's a mostly fun British gangster romp, with a token American, this time Mickey (McConaughey) as the pot-dealing kingpin. It's ironic in that they are mostly gentlemen in how they dress and how they speak, except or the number of c-bombs dropped! Great cast, but lots of players, so no one gets much of a chance to shine.Mickey's tale of selling his drug empire to Mathew (Strong) is told via a long discussion between Fletcher (Grant), a journalist, and Raymond (Hunnam), Mickey's right-hand-man. Grant is pretty funny trying to do a possibly Welsh accent. The device of using the discussion to show the narrative, means the film can go back and correct the story when it needs to. There's a few twists and turns and while it's fun watching Grant and Hunnam, the film really picks up in the final act when we're in \"real time\". Good to see Farrell have fun, as well as Golding and Dockery.The main problem with the narrative device is that Mickey doesn't seem real and McConaughey's character isn't really fleshed out.

It didn't have that funny and clever wit, that we have all grown to love from Guy Ritchie's earlier films, and the swearing seemed inappropriate and over the top in places. The back and forth of the storyline spoilt the flow of the film, and it felt messy in places. Although people were praising the cast's performances, I thought that all of them was a weird choice for there roles, and I must admit, I fell asleep halfway through the film. There were a couple of strokes of genius, like the freezer scene towards the end, and when McConaughey saved his wife, but most of it wasn't that memorable. Personally, I would have used Colin Farell's character much more throughout the film, and there should have been more character building because I couldn't care less who lived or died. It really reminded me of Get Shorty, in terms of McConaughey trying to correct his mistakes in life, but the fact that comedy element was missing, really let the movie down. In all, it's another one watch in my eyes, and I personally think that Guy Ritchie has lost his touch. Average!Round-Up:\nThis movie was directed by Guy Ritchie, who also brought you Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Swept Away, Revolver, RocknRolla, Sherlock Holmes, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, the Man from U.N.C.L.E., King Arthur and Aladdin. Like Quentin Tarantino, he seems to have lost his passion for movie making of late, after a boost to the big time with his earlier movies, and I personally can't see him making another film that will touch them. As for this movie, he did try his utmost to bring back the golden years, with the cockney gangsters and heavy soundtrack, but it was a right mess. With another Aladdin movie in the pipeline, along with 2 other films called Empire Rising and Cash Truck, I personally can't see them pushing him back into the big leagues, which is a shame because I can still watch his earlier movies, over and over again.Budget: $22million\nWorldwide Gross: $115.2millionGenre: Action, Comedy, Crime\nCast: Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Michelle Dockery, Colin Farrell, Hugh Grant, Jeremy Strong, Lynne Renee, Henry Golding, Tom Wu, Eddie Marsan, John Dagleish and Jordan Long. 5/10",

            "content": "'The Gentlemen (2020)' is fine, consistently engaging and occasionally quite fun. It does have a plethora of problems, though. First of all, it's never quite clear just who we're supposed to be rooting for. This doesn't feel intentional and seems to be the result of its odd, flashback-based structure. There isn't a great sense of escalation and the pace remains mostly consistent. The narrative doesn't catch up with itself until far too late and, even then, it's annoying how most of the story is told via narrated exposition to someone apparently directly involved with most of its events. Secondly, the flick is simply an amalgamation of genre tropes and stock characters, almost exactly what you expect from a Guy Ritchie movie that isn't 'Aladdin (2019)'. The characters aren't really given the time necessary to develop properly; they're always walking stereotypes. Some of them even seem like stand-ins for the director himself, with talk of \"proper cinema\" and references to films like 'The Conversation (1973)' being \"a bit boring\". Finally, the flick is kind of racist. Almost every character makes some kind of racist remark, mainly against members of Asian and Black communities, and it's often used for supposed 'humour'. The worst offence is probably when a major character says another has a 'black heart' while specifically referencing race. The flick's treatment of women isn't much better, with the only female character coming under the threat of rape just so she can be violently saved by a white man. It all feels outdated, like someone scrambling against apparent 'PC gone mad'. Plus, a lot of time is strangely spent trying to justify its problematic elements; characters have discussions about whether or not certain racist remarks are actually racist. All of this results in an affair that only sours with time, staying in your mind just long enough for you to consider its faults and then slipping away into complete obscurity. It's really forgettable, probably because it's so generic. It's not terrible, though. As I mentioned, it's often quite enjoyable and it's always engaging. Hugh Grant's scene-stealing performance is a real highlight, too. It's messy and misjudged but it's entertaining enough to keep you in your seat. 5/10",

But only once, in the morally bankrupt RocknRolla, did this ruin the film and have me booing, metaphorically, at the end; his undoubted talent as a filmmaker has glossed over these shortcomings on all other occasions.The Gentlemen is the latest in the series, written and directed by Mr Ritchie. Matthew McConaughey plays drug lord Mickey Pearson who is looking to sell his British interests, attracting the attention of other underworld figures keen to inherit his thriving empire.Guy Ritchie's sharp direction and non-lateral storytelling are on top form. The script is crisp and witty, the continual plot twists keep you on your toes. If you feel some of the Mockney dialogue is a little bombastic, well, it'd be like going to watch a Carry On film and then complaining about double entendres - over the top dialogue is what he does; it's his trademark. And his homage to The Long Good Friday is a nice touch and contains a further surprise.Most of the cast are also on top form, clearly enjoying themselves. Special mention to Hugh Grant playing a seedily odious private investigator-cum-blackmailer. His portrayal is something of a meta joke, channelling his hatred of the British tabloid hacks who have famously pursued the illegal tactics which his character practices. Perhaps the only failure is Henry Golding, in his first role outside rom-com, not quite convincing as a would-be Pablo Escobar. And it's a shame the excellent Colin Farrell's role isn't beefed up more. But these are mere quibbles.The Gentlemen is a fast paced and laugh out loud action movie, an enjoyable holiday treat for adults.",

            "content": "Our 2nd new Movie of the year was so opposite to Little Women in character but turned out just as enjoyable in a very different way.My Review - The Gentleman. My Rating 8.5 /10The trailers for The Gentlemen doesn't give a lot away and either will my Review except to say if you enjoyed the classic black comedy In Bruges (2008) with Colin Farrell,who is one of \"The Gentlemen \" or Guy Ritchie's \"The Snatch \"2000 you should really enjoy this film.If really full on swearing especially the 'C\" word offends you ( it doesn't bother me at all if it fits the characters but it may not be your cup of tea.\nThere is violence more implied and not graphic and the plots fast paced and convoluted but it's so clever and original and very very funny in parts .I'm really looking forward to seeing it again to catch up on a few plot lines that passed me by.\nThe performances are all top class especially Hugh Grant who I've never considered a really great actor but I've change my mind after today.\nIn fact his performances in the last few films he's been in like A Very English Scandal and Paddington 2 up until The Gentlemen I would say have been his best acting roles.\nHe is cast in The Gentlemen as Fletcher a Private Investigator trying to fleece $20 million from a British gangster hit man cartel . Hugh Grant's performance in my opinion is the funniest detective role to come along since Peter Sellers Chief Inspector Clouseau . He's brilliant as the very camp cunningly conniving Fletcher and his East end drawl is incredibly clever acting .Often fine performances are due to a good director and Guy Ritchie who directed and wrote the screenplay for The Gentlemen has excelled in this film .\nI enjoyed this more than the recent \"Knives Out \" film which was very good but The Gentlemen I think is in a Class similar to the late Blake Edwards at his best.The other stand out performances are from Academy Award winner Matthew McConaughey as Mickey Pearson an American expat who became rich by building a marijuana empire in London .\nA Simplified version of the plot is that when word gets out that Mickey is looking to cash out his business,it soon triggers an array of plots and schemes from those who want his fortune.Michelle Dockery completely buries any vision of herself as Lady Mary from Downton Abbey in the Gentlemen in her role as Mickey's wife and business partner with a hot gangster moll outfit and figure to match and some red hot lines to match,she's sensational in this role .In fact all the performances are good we see Henry Golding step out of his nice Asian dude character from Crazy Rich Asians and an angel in Last Christmas to play Dry Eye a young gangster protege trying to take over the territory from his Uncle Wang Young. Harlie Hunam as Raymond and Colin Farrell as Coach also give stand out performances\nI was really surprised and delighted by how much I enjoyed The Gentlemen and look forward to seeing it again.",

Was it an enjoyable couple of hours, on the whole yes. Was it as good as Lock Stock or Snatch, never came close. It had it's funny moments but far to much felt a bit forced, the script was no where near as sharp as either of the afore mentioned films and really it wasn't even good or original as Rock'n' Rolla.Now to my main problem with this film and the massive question of originality or the distinct lack of, in Hollywood these days. The Gentleman was basically a tired attempt to redo The Long Good Friday, yes the premise was slightly different but aspects like the gun \"hands across the sea\" engraving on the derringer but what is unforgivable and so,nothing Ritchie should be ashamed of, is where he ripped off the iconic final Bob Hoskins scene when he is taken by the IRA in his own car, everything down to the expressions McConaughey and the gunman pointing his gun between the seats was just copied from LGF, lazy, lazy writing.As I said, it is worth a watch but prepare to be left a little dissatisfied.",

Spin that idea over two hours of action in the Ritchie style and the story explodes like a July 4th evening of color and noise. The language is typically raw and predominantly profanity - and that fits the style of the story.The cast is a collection of some excellent actors: Hugh Grant 'narrates' much of the story to Ray (Charlie Hunnam), Mickey's consiglieri, and intertwines the myriad groups of eager procurers of McConaughey's marijuana estate - Jeremy Strong, Colin Farrell, Henry Golding, Tom Wu, Eddie Marsan, Jason Wong et al. Michelle Dockery is Mickey's hardnosed wife, the reason Mickey performs so well.At times the strained Cockney accents and other permutations of the English language seem forced (or simply undecipherable), but the action never stops, and the script contains some pungent ideas.

To me Guy Ritchie just needs a break from these types of films, to be honest at times it felt like someone was making a \"Guy Ritchie\" rip off. I am shocked, to say the least, at the positive response to this film............its was so poor, and I had no expectations going in at all!!!!!The only ok part of the film for me is, that its mildly entertaining, it wasn't dull. Even though I really really didn't like the film, I will definitely disagree with anyone who tries to say they were bored watching it. There are some occasional laughs to have along the way, however for me its just not enough to cover up from the mind-numbingly bad decisions that were made.The dialogue ! Its laughably bad, I know there is meant to be a certain cockney sort of stereotype in Guy Ritchie's films but this was just so far over the mark. Everyone was just playing a caricature of that type of stereotype and it was straight from the beginning. It stuck out to me and just couldn't escape my mind how silly it looked. The opening scene look how McConaughey dials the number in his phone.............face palm..... I suppose you buy into this stupid reality that is created and go along for the ride but to me no, I just couldn't take any of them seriously...........it was ludicrous!!The acting isn't at its best there are a lot of people coasting, McConaughey looks completely bored thinking what happened to the McCnaissance apart from when he gets angry now and then. I don't really like Charlie Hunman I think he is always trying to hard, but thats me?!?! He accent is always all over the place in pretty much every film he is in, this one is no different. Colin Farrell is taking a pay check and just looks like he learned his lines about a min before shooting. The only person I would say that was doing anything different or at least trying was Hugh Grant who was different to say the least. Had some good laughs but was also probably the worse culprit of the stereotypical accent or just weird persona created.Overall I am really shocked and stunned by the positivity surrounding this film, it came out in January for a reason..........its the garbage month of the year!?!? For me its 30% out of 100 its pretty bad if you ask me for the reasons I've given, I'd high recommend it to people to avoid, don't waste your time watch one of Guy Ritchie's films from early in his career, not this wannabe!",

The Gentleman is fun, it's flashy, it's amusing - it's Guy Richie. But it also feels like a rehashed pastiche of a bygone era. An era when he made crime movies that were genuinely funny and gripping.

He played his role far too straight. He was completely deadpan. Not at any point was there a twinkle in his eye. His wife, Rosalind Pearson, wouldn't look out of place on the set of EastEnders, what, with her obnoxious attitude and aggression. So, as a duo, I was completely detached from them. I certainly wasn't hoping they'd survive being eliminated by their foes. In fact, I was hoping they would come a cropper.I felt the boxing club lads - who recorded their exploits - deserved some punishment for pinching McConaughey's plants and equipment. Yet it was their coach, Farrell, who had to face the consequences of the boys' actions. Yes, he put himself forward, but the lads got off far too easy. I'm guessing the boxing lads were not challenged due to them being (majority) black. Because if you have McConaughey's (majority) white henchmen pasting them AND the Chinese outfit, well, it might appear a little racist. I wouldn't have thought that as a viewer. I also recall reading a review which stated if you take your eyes off the screen for one moment you will lose track of the script. I have to say, I didn't find the picture complicated at all. Not at any point did I feel I wasn't aware of the motivations. I even b\u00fcgg\u00e9red off around the 70 minute mark to change my bedding without pausing the film and returned to it without any problems.It is unlikely I will watch this again.

It plays well on his outfit because it contrasts with his suit and tie preppy look. Also when you are a mobster that need to chase parkour enthusiasts, make sure to get that genuine leaher strap for you automatic silenced rifle that you are jogging with.\nIt will help you carry that 6.8lbs gun while you are running in a three-piece suit, but more importantly it will also match your oxfords.If you are looking for some fine scotch to enjoy while Hugh Grant sabotages his career, try out Glenfarclas , its smooth and it looks good.There are not a lot of opportunities to BBQ outside in England so you will absolutely want to check out this lovely barbercue table with built-in fire. It can really give your garden some cachet, especially when you have people over.The movie also portrays characters? I am not sure, things happen on screen, they kill a russian teenager I think, the Lion is selling weed technology. If you can sort these words in order good for you, it doesn't really matter\nColin Farell is dressed in a track suit and is the mentor of a Youtube channel, where I can only imagine we can find his merch in the bio, otherwise I don't see how he can monetize his content. It really makes you think how technology has changed the way we buy and percieve brands hasn't it ?\nI like some of the tracksuits. But I don't think I am confident I can rock that look.\nThere is a third choice though between the three-piece suit to go to the pub(or the chase in the bad parts of town, really its that versatile) and the Chanel tracksuit when you go to the gym, after the kebab place. It is : the Chinese-Bond? I forgot the characters name but it was equally racially-sensitive and appropriate. Asian-007 ? Oriental-Brosnan ? Something like that. Anyway he opts for soft looking jackets with a simply a cashmere jumper or turtleneck underneath. It gives him a more agile look and younger apperance.On the culture side of things, it is 2020, so eveyrobdy is gay, wants to be gay, appears to be gay, hates to be gay and hates the gays. All at the same time.\nRace relations? Yeah same thing. It is cool and bad to be black/chinese.\nWhatever your position on these issues is, it will be in the movie. It will have no impact, because this is not trash re-heated 20 year garbage of a director who has become a parody of himself. No this is Art!\nOh and by the way Matthew McConaughey is Amercian, how quirky is that?P.S. : While writing about this I remembered the Hugh Grant dancing scene in Love Actually. I can only respect Hugh Grant in this movie to no play on his strenghs, and give us something absolutely no-one asked for, wanted, or even knew was possible. Bravo Sir! Bravo!",

The group of druggies , well known for DIY, miraculously have a hammer on the coffee table in order to give the guy a weapon with which to attack the heavy. The upmarket daughter druggie who just like that gives up her friends and the life in the squat, just like that. The fact that the Hugh Grant character is there, with a camera, at exactly the right second to snap the fallen youth. The Hannam character runs through the street coat tails flapping chasing the guy with the phone, but amazingly a few seconds later , withdraws a big f off assault rifle just when he needs it from beneath the said coat. Lets not go into the ludicrous scene where the trainee boxers do cart wheels etc in the theft of the grass.\nI know it's only a movie but unless you are appealing to the slapstick market, you must do better than this, much, much better Ritchie. Likewise Hugh Grant, his pivotal role was played like someone from a rep company at times, it wasn't funny, it wasn't vaguely threatening as he was hinting at, it was just well blah, pretty much like the whole offering..

Okay, end of movie. Let's find another. But wait, did we really see Michael killed? It did look like we would go back in time to the point of that killing, but we don't do that either. Read on.Instead we have a Private eye Fletcher (Hugh Grant) who gives a movie-long narrative for a movie he wants to produce, and that is basically this story titled Bush (Marijuana). The Story he says is in his imagination, but in reality, it is the story that we will see unfold. The truth is he wants money to not produce his movie or he will be forced to produce and let the world know all about Michael Pearson. Listening to him talking with Ray (Charlie Hunnam), who is Michael's right hand man and the bottom line is that Fletcher is blackmailing Ray to give him $20Million to keep his secrets. We don't know all the players and listening to him doesn't make much sense, but as he narrates, we see the story unfold. I do believe the story could have unfolded more easily without this narration. But that's just me.To make things easier here are the players who are out to get Michael's marijuana business: Chinaman Dry Eye (Henry Golding); and Oklahoma billionaire Big Dave (Eddie Marsan). That is basically all you need to know.\nNotables: Michelle Dockery as Rosalind, Michael's wife; Colin Farrell as Coach, who runs a boxing training facility, and whose boys were the ones without his knowing who violated one of Michael's Marijuana farms. And this caused a big drop in price according to Matthew later on.Not sure why the Title of this movie is what it is. I didn't see any Gentlemen in here. There are twists in here, but keep in mind Michael is on top of everything as you will come to understand at the end.McConaughey is always good and is always on top of his game. Acting by all was very good.Not sure why this story was even told and put on film. A lot of what you will see in here is confusing and there is some unnecessary violence. The story itself did not impact me in any way as it was in my opinion a very simple story. That is to say forgettable.

            "content": "Manner maketh man, as a certain character once said. And Guy Ritchie has turned The Gentlemen into a showcase for that undisputed truth. However, the same character also said that a villain's quality is crucial for the whole film's well-being, and that is where this movie falls flat on its bum.The best Ritchie's films can be described in one sentence: a little triumph for a little guy. Lock & Stock, Snatch and even Rocknrolla are built about the fate of small-time people with quite limited prospects in life. Yes, they are clever, funny and often very lucky, but it's never a \"rags to riches forever\" story, more like a \"rags to riches to probably lots of irrational spending and rags again\" one. And that's what makes those films fun and protagonists relatable for the masses: we all enjoy seeing little men screw over big men once in a while, without becoming the evil they were destined to fight.Here, however, we are supposed to sympathize with a big, very big man and his top minion. I agree that Matthew McConaughey is extremely charismatic and his vocal manner makes my ears melt in ecstasy, and that Charlie Hunnam looks quite the man with a full beard. But Ritchie invests so much into the \"protagonist\" side, yet leaves so little for the \"antagonist\" one. The \"bad guys\" are nether imposing nor cunning nor even well presented enough. You are inclined to root for the good guys because they are usually outnumbered and maybe even outgunned, but here there's no true sense of worthy confrontation, which makes you wish the \"bush brothers\" to break a leg in a literal, not a theatrical sense.All this leaves us with one sad conclusion, that Guy Ritchie still knows how to do things in style but totally forgot how to bring in the substance (except the controlled ones of course, they are still aplenty). All this street gang stuff, fight porn and rap clips, and even the selfie time homage might be fun for those born on this side of the century, but for us old-timers the creative decline is quite obvious.But even today's Ritchie could not have come without a single ace up his sleeve. Hugh Grant as a well-mannered, slightly over the hedge and a tad too clearly mancraving fox of a gentleman, is a true soul of this feature, a real reason to watch this film through. And at the end, he's the only one you truly wanna root for. Which is quite symbolic, because that's the very character who's practically begging for a sequel through what used to be the fourth wall. Don't know about y'all, but I'm interested only if they film what he's writing, kinky parts included.",

            "content": "All the films directed by Guy Ritchie over the last decade that I have seen have been disappointments to me, so I was very close to skip seeing 'The Gentlemen' in theaters, leaving it, maybe, for a later viewing. What convinced me in the end was the impressive note on IMDB (8.1). Over 40,000 film fan mates can't go wrong, I told myself, and I'm not sorry. 'The Gentlemen' is Ritchie's best film I remember ever seeing (but I should mention that I did not see 'Snatch' made at the beginning of his career, which I read a lot of good things about). 'The Gentlemen' is a violent action movie, stylish, funny, original, with a select cast. Those who don't like gangster movies would probably do well to avoid it, but all the other movie lovers have a lot of reasons to go and see it.Guy Ritchie is not a director who walks the beaten track. Even when he has an interesting and an already complicated story in his hand like 'The Gentlemen', he chooses to tell it in an unconventional way. In other films I had the impression that preoccupation with his own directorial vision spoils the effect, but here the convention created by him works very well. What we have in the film is a story about gangsters fighting for control over the narcotics manufacturing and distribution industry in today's England. An upper-class Mafia-style boss (Matthew McConaughey) plans to sell his business, and two rival gangs fight to get their hands on it. In addition to the fact that the story is quite complicated already, it is narrated in cinematic style by a blackmail journalist / detective (Hugh Grant), who beautifies it by presenting it in the form of ... a movie script. The pretext is created not only for a 'movie-in-movie' narrative, but also to permanently question what we see on the screen. Do we see what actually happened? Do we see a version invented or modified to serve the purposes of the blackmailer? Or maybe what we see is fiction, the fruit of a script writer's imagination?It will take the average viewer (the category I like to fall in) about 10-15 minutes to understand the unconventional way the story is told and get used to it. If he manages to cross this threshold, I think, there are enough moments of cinematic satisfaction and good quality entertainment in this film. The distribution is excellent. Matthew McConaughey transitions professionally from his roles as a good and handsome guy to the role here of a (very) bad and handsome guy. Hugh Grant already has 35 (!) years of career behind him, but it seems that he is only now maturing and moving from the beau roles to senior acting, and what an actor he is! I think part two of his career will be even better than the first. Nearly unrecognizable and just as good is Colin Farrell. The fourth ace in Ritchie's hand is Charlie Hunnam , an actor whom I know less, but who acts at parity with his famous partners. I was told that I should be familiar with Michelle Dockery , but I am not as I didn't see 'Downton Abbey', and I confess that she didn't impress me here. Certainly, in 'The Gentlemen', the male side rules. There are many memorable scenes in the film, especially those that rely on class differences, as they are expressed in language, behavior, and tools of violence. The scenario is very talkative, which may seem a little inappropriate because gangsters generally talk less and shoot more, but that's part of the convention. Finally, I can say that I liked 'The Gentlemen' and that the film has restored the stature of Guy Ritchie in my eyes.",

I don't wanna watch a film and be thinking of the \"Direction\" of the film. I only want to watch the film and think about the story, characters, relationships etc. There is such thing as over directing, which means your focus is on camera work, staging actors etc, rather than having an organic composition of the scene, i.e. letting the actors play out the scene in a natural way or at least it should feel that way.The whole idea of movies is to suspend your disbelief, not to make us aware it is a movie by constantly doing things that takes us out of the experience.On top of that the actors (likely from being directed this way) were so over the top i.e. trying too hard to create memorable characters. The dialogue didn't help. No one speaks like this. They just don't. The clever monologues and tired Hollywood repartee.I am just so tired of seeing these phony overly staged and directed movies.Of course as I saw the credits, all my intuitive feelings were validated because of course it was a Guy Richie film, the king of style over substance director.So cringeworthy.",

McConaughey mistakenly brings his usual earnest acting style to a world that's as real a depiction of the Brit underworld as The Magic Roundabout is of a midsummer's fete in The Wicker Man.As usual, Guy has bought in top artistes such as Hugh Grant, Michelle Dockery, Colin Farrell, Jeremy Strong and similar to convey the deeply wrought characters in his latest Carry-On-Gangsta fairy tale.Thing is, there's no such thing as a good or bad Ritchieflick - you can't really compare him to other filmmakers because, as previously noted, he's all his own thing. You can tell he wants to be a Tarantino or Scorsese, but unlike those auteurs, he swims in a rather more shallow pool of human behaviour, that inhabited by a kind of watery species of cliche. There are so, so many, but here's an example: Ritchie graciously takes the time to have Farrell's character mansplain certain racist terms for the viewer, so if you happen to be black and someone calls you a black c***, there's no need to feel offended. Glad that's sorted then. Has anyone told the rest of the world?Honestly? It's a fun hatewatch, silly without ever being wretched or (god forbid) too serious, but there are so many other filmmakers out there who really do deserve your attention and hard-earned. Taken on its own terms, it's the usual hilariously puerile piece of dog s#!*% - well put together and turned out, like a spotty teen wearing his dad's expensive suit and attempting to fill it out by puffing up his chest. Except this teen will likely never grow up - he'll just carry on making this kind of stunted fare. He thinks it's stylish, and maybe it is, if someone else is doing it.

The Chinese are an organization of four or five; the Russians are three, four as well. It's like a movie written by a 17yo fan-fiction wannabe.if someone else would have come with such a script, wouldn't have ever seen the lights of cinema, right? People are complaining it's 'too wordy', that's not a problem; if you like Tarkovsky, or Bergman, or so many other cinema giants, you know there's no such thing as 'too wordy'; but when the script is this poor that would not make it to straight2dvd - that's another issue entirely.Mr. Ritchie has some great stuff in the past; who knows, maybe his next project will be a bit closer to his own potential.Looks like this generation loves to live stuff just for the sake of loving them; nothing wrong with that.Anyway.Written by Mickey Mouse; for the Mickey Mouse generation.",

He's not in touch with the east end or has any insight to offer us about criminals he's just a luvvie behind a camera who tapped a rich vein but that vein has gone. This rag bag of all the Ritchie tropes; jump cut, montage framing, story within a story, quirky characters and an end which isn't an end have all been done before and better.\nMost of the story is told via a two hander narrator and audience device comprising Grant (who has great fun with the role of slimy journalist) and Hunnam makes the audience role work. The narration revolves around McConaughey as the ex pat yank running a large scale marijuana business in the UK which he wants to sell up and retire from, shades of Layer Cake which tells the story a whole lot better, and this is the first problem. Now McConaughey is fine actor who was obviously hired with an eye to the US market and his ability to display a lethal charm but the conceit to make this work; failed Rhodes Scholar who finds he has a talent for dealing weed to the toffs, is just too much of a stretch, not helped by McConaughey basically sleep walking through the film.\nIn the course of the film we meet his Jewish, fey, buyer, played so badly by Jeremy Strong, who naturally tries to put one over on McConaughey, with the assistance of an up coming Hong Kong gangster and comic boxing gym assortment gang of east end stereotypes. Cue overt and covert racist and anti semitic 'jokes' which are pretty tasteless and don't advance the plot.\nIncluded in the mix are a stereotype wannabe uncultured newspaper proprietor, played terribly by Eddie Marsan - why do film makers still hire this bloke? Who wants to bring down McConaughey for the flimsyest of reasons and is the notional employer of Grant. Also McConaughey's wife running a posh car business, an utter waste of Dockery's talents, a missing heiress and of course a Russian ogligarch and his ex KGB henchmen (30 years ago Guy).\nSuffice to say there are mix ups, we are miss directed, there are bodies, there is dark humour but it never really adds up to much, mainly because the idea of a charming yank convincing his posh uni customers who now own stately homes on acres of ground they can't afford to turn a blind eye to his underground cannabis farms on his land is utterly ludicrous.\nThe one bright spot is Colin Farrell as the gym owner with a past who is excellent in every scene he steals.\nCan some enjoyment be had? Well obviously yes but in no way is this a 10 or 9 rating and those who would put such a rating up need to take a look at themselves. This is a bang average piece of work which is 30 minutes too long.has",

Snatch was the better follow up. Now finally we get the good new version of the same genre packed with movie stars, and chemistry that actually works. McConaughey delivered an outstanding performance, as it one of the characters he was born to play. He does not succeed in every role, but some of them are a perfect fit. Hugh Grant did an excellent job,as this role was different than his usual movies. For the first time in many years, I loved Colin Farrel as a cool coach, as his chemistry with Hunnam and charismatic presence filled every scene he was at.\nNow for some of the weaker points of the movie.\nI loved Charlie Hunnam ever since Green street hooligans, yet I didn't feel that was the perfect role for him. His character is cool, resourceful and smart. Yet it felt that for some scenes, he was a bit out of pace. Fir example the scenes with the junkies, some deeper disgust form his part was missing from the formula. He still delivered, but for this movie to be a masterpiece, it should have been some one else.\nThe story could have been a bit deeper. It was missing some edge, especially towards the end. That's where the whole idea of Lock Stock and Snatch shined the most, Gentlemen dropped a ball a bit. It needs a different ending.\nThe eccentric antagonist of the movie is not a good counterpart to McConaughey. That casting was off entirely. It felt like Jesse Aisenberg iin the role of Lex Luthor.Other than that, this movie is great and I hope Guy Ritchie will consider to do a follow up.",

The cast was very impressive with big names perfect for each of their roles. And most of the characters were incredibly liekable. As none of them gave a damn about anyone else which just made them instantly charecters you could get behind. And there was so many campy over the top performances that just worked well for the film.What i also liked was that all the characters got equal screen time. They managed to find a way where each of the characters got equal time for development and to show of there personalities. So you could form some form of connection to there characters which was fun to watch.However my first negative would be that the films plot wasn't original enough. This sort of thing has been done before, with the whole drug dealer wanting to sell his business and people wanting to stop them is something we have seen before. I couldn't help but feel they could of been more creative and had more of a plot that separates itself from previous films like this but unfortunately it didn't.Next i thought that the films script was very clever and its visuals were great. The film's script was excellent at making you play along with the plot of the movie. As the dynamic of splitting the screen time between past and present with Hugh Grant and Charlie Hunman worked well. But also they did some interesting things with the visuals. Including making the frame look like an old camera from the early 20th century, and the cinematography and set pieces were colourful, interesting and led to some great action sequences and uses of props.Next the film was very funny. All the characters said some hilarious things that you weren't expecting to come out of there mouths. The film definitely went for shock factor with the humour which largely worked as something different. But i do have to say the film overstepped the line with some of its humour. I just thought that they overstepped the line with the constant use of the c word especially involving a scene with black actor Bugzy Malone. The humour involving a pig was just slightly to controversial as well, it all just depends on how much of the crudeness and shock factor you can take.Now my final positive would be the excellent stand out performance from Hugh Grant. Wow what a different role for him, but he made it work and i was left pleasantly surprised. His very campy and humorous performance was a breath of fresh air and fantastic to watch every time he was on screen. And his character was delightfully sneaky making you have a good blend of liking and disliking his character.Now my final two negatives that for me held back the movie from being great and made it more disappointing for me. It had a very over complicated plot and the ending was sadly poorly executed. The film was just narratively weak sadly, they had way to many subplots and randomly thrown in moments that it just didn't work and it becomes to difficult to keep up with even for the most clever of audience members. So despite it being less then 2 hours it felt longer and the narrative lacked a clear focus. And the ending was sadly very bad. It kept on stopping and starting, what i mean by that is it felt like the film had about 4 different endings. Also it felt like they couldn't decide how to end it so they just stuffed all 4 in to lazily set up a sequel so this was a shame.Overall despite good performances, visuals creativity and great humour the film falls flat with its lack of creative plot and its narrative weaknesses that makes the film overall disappointing.",

            "review_title": "back to the Ritchie roots",
            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Let's get this out of the way upfront. Filmmaker Guy Ritchie's return to London crime-comedy is most assuredly a bit too far removed from today's acceptable Politically Correct line. It features mostly male characters and far too many stereotypes to count. It's also ridiculously funny. Mr. Ritchie doesn't take his story or characters too seriously, but he proves yet again that he's serious about entertainment.The film begins with Matthew McConaughey ordering \"a pint and a pickled egg\", a jolt to the senses, and a very cool opening credits sequence (think James Bond). We then find Fletcher, a sleazy private detective, making a surprise appearance at Ray's (Charlie Hunnam) house. Fletcher is played by a deliciously smarmy Hugh Grant. He is trying to extort 20 million from Ray by offering up the details he has uncovered about Ray and his boss, marijuana kingpin Mickey Pearson (McConaughey). Conveniently, Fletcher has turned the story into a screenplay, which he has generously agreed to include for the 20 million.It's tricky business trying to make drug dealers likable, and Ritchie steers clear of this despite the presence of a few. In addition to Mickey, we have Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong) who is trying to buy Mickey's business; Lord George (Tom Wu), who controls the Chinese syndicate; and Dry Eye (Henry Goulding), an ambitious underling of Lord George who is anxious to make his own way, by any means necessary. Other players here include Mickey's wife Rosalind (Michele Dockery, \"Downton Abbey\", \"Godless\") who runs a \"safe space\" garage for exotic cars owned by women; Coach (Colin Farrell) who runs a boxing gym for troubled young adults; and Big Dave (Eddie Marsan), a tabloid editor seeking revenge for a dinner party where he felt Mickey disrespected him.As if all of those characters don't provide enough humorous crime fodder, we also have a Russian Oligarch, street gangs, heritage estate owners in need of cash, YouTube fight porn, and the plight of Laura Pressfield (Eliot Sumner, Sting's daughter) in a heroin haven. Fletcher's ongoing narrative for Ray provides the framework for the film, and each scene is filled to the rim with clever and wise-cracking dialogue - often delivered with flair by one of our colorful characters. Mr. Grant and Mr. Farrell are exceptionally fun to watch, and Ms. Dockery leaves us wishing her Rosalind was more prominently featured.For some reason he's never been a critical favorite, though Guy Ritchie garnered a cult following with his early frenetic crime flicks LOCK, STOCK and TWO SMOKING BARRELS (1998) and SNATCH (2000). Lately he's been focusing on big budget films like SHERLOCK HOLMES (2009), SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS (2011), THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. (2015) and ALADDIN (2019). He's back to his roots here, and is joined by many actors and crew members he's worked with before. Ritchie co-wrote the screenplay with Ivan Atkinson and Marne Davies. His cinematographer is Alan Stewart (ALADDIN) and his film editor in charge of those signature smash-cuts is frequent collaborator James Herbert.Quick listening pays off in some deadpan one-liners that might otherwise sneak by, although most of them can't be repeated here. The \"c-word\" most frequently used in the film is not 'cash', and is rarely a term of affection. There is even a Miramax gag. Too soon? Only you can decide. It's rare for McConaughey to play the heavy, and he seems to relish the opportunity. But then most of the actors seem to really enjoy delivering these lines and wearing these clothes ... well except for Colin Farrell's track suits and spectacles! Certainly this one isn't for the masses, and undoubtedly people will be offended. This is what happens when you make Guy Ritchie play nicely for a decade.",

The movie is surprisingly good with a witty script that is filled with humor; a story that is filled with twists and turns, and a huge cast ensemble which everyone does a great job in their characters. I did think the movie was kind of boring in the first half hour until it picks up. The movie is not in a chronological order.The plot follows Reporter Fletcher (Hugh Grant) breaks into Raymond's (Charlie Hunnam) home. Requesting a lot of money in exchange for a return that Raymond's boss Mickey (Matthew McConaughey) and his organization of pot dealing story does not get sold to a movie studio. Fletcher and Raymond go over the story on what happened in the past. With Mickey wanting to retire from his organization. Which Dry Eye (Henry Golding) is trying to buy his organization but Mickey refuses. Creating a conflict with Dry Eye. Meanwhile, Coach (Colin Farrell) and his group of young adults accidently breaks into Mickey's plant farm. While Raymond is trying to get everything settled with dealing any conflict that Mickey has.It was a good story. It was all over the place. From the perspectives as Fletcher was talking to Raymond about in the beginning of the movie. There is a scene that Fletcher wrote a screen play from when he was spying on Matthew (Jeremy Strong) and Dry eye. Which he has himself and Raymond acting it out. It was funny and stupid. The film does have some fun humor. Then, there are some dark and serious moments which can be tough to watch.The cast ensemble is great with the movie. Matthew McConaughey takes the lead playing Mickey. There are some powerful moments when a dramatic tension leads him to fighting back. Charlie Hunnam was great. Henry Golding was good playing Dry Eye. Rosalind who is Mickey's wife played by Michelle Dockery is also good as well. Jeremy Strong and Eddie Marsan are good. Colin Farrell was good and funny with his character. Hugh Grant almost unrecognizable playing Fletcher was funny and good.Guy Ritchie direction and script delivered a gangster drama movie with witty dialogue, narrative, and humor. It is what you can expect in a Guy Ritchie's movie. There are some over dramatic moments with a powerful music score by Christopher Benstead.Overall, The Gentlemen is a good action crime film. It does have a slow and confusing narrative beginning. The film kicks off with a humorous and witty direction and a good cast to hold the movie together with a story that has plenty of twists and turns to make it worth watching.",

            "review_title": "Guy Ritchie's The Player",
            "content": "Spoilers Warning Elaborated: Review also contains spoilers for \"The Mystery of the Leaping Fish\" (1916) and \"The Player\" (1992).A stylish, vernacular dialect-heavy gangster flick, \"The Gentlemen\" is very much in the tradition of Guy Ritchie's earliest acclaimed films, \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" (1998) and \"Snatch\" (2000). But, the storytelling devices here are more intricately reflexive, although his prior efforts are also known for their non-linear composition. As referenced above, it does what \"The Player\" (1992) did, with the script for the very movie we're watching being pitched within that movie, \"Bush,\" which was actually a working title, as written by Hugh Grant's character. Indeed, in the end, the script is pitched to Miramax and Ritchie himself, the actual producer and author of the movie. The entire picture is a deconstruction of itself, as well as this type of Ritchie production--revealing and reveling in the filmmaking processes and the convoluted criminal operations.\"The Player\" and \"The Gentlemen\" are only two examples of this device. The earliest such instance in a film that I recall is interesting and, perhaps, telling. \"The Mystery of the Leaping Fish\" (1916) ended in similar fashion, with its star Douglas Fairbanks pitching the scenario to the studio. Both pictures involve that vice of drugs, as one particular conversation in \"The Gentlemen\" elaborates upon, in their plotting. Here, it's a marijuana kingpin and a struggle over his empire; in the Fairbanks vehicle, it's a cocaine-fueled, among other narcotics, detective. The silent film, of course, was a Sherlock Holmes parody. Given that Ritchie has made two Sherlock Holmes movies, perhaps it's not inconceivable that he's seen \"The Mystery of the Leaping Fish,\" despite its relative obscurity due to being a silent film from 1916.There's more to the reflexivity, though. Hugh Grant also stands in as the in-film surrogate camera(man), spying for a tabloid owner, taking photographs and recording video. He runs lines with Charlie Hunnam in one scene. They compete over narrator (un)reliability, for control of the movie. Heck, even those glasses they wear tend to reflect the equipment employed to make the movie. There are also the \"fight porn\" videos as films-within-the-film. That's in addition to the aspect ratio fluctuations and showing the celluloid (I seem to recall there's a German word for that, but I forget it) in fourth-wall-breaking fashion as Grant discusses filmmaking craft, albeit his celebration of celluloid seems odd in a movie that I believe--correct me if I'm wrong (as it's sometimes hard to tell when every film ends up digital anyways)--was shot digitally. I get that it's an homage to a vintage style, as this entire movie is vintage Guy Ritchie, but still, I miss celluloid. It's not unlike, say, \"The Conversation\" (1973), the \"it's a bit boring\" film referenced at one point, showing its soundtrack--indeed, making the film about it--in the film itself. \"The Gentlemen\" is more \"The Conversation\" than \"The Godfather\" films in that way.In the sidelong glance (Grant) at a sidelong glance (Hunnam) in the picture's schema of its central character played by Matthew McConaughey, it's the periphery characters played by Grant and, in an especially superfluous role, Colin Farrell who steal the show. Too bad neither received any awards attention. I think Grant really has the most interesting role here, being charged with the construction of the meta narrative and afforded to be sleazy without the macho facade of the rest, and Farrell's line readings are the best. Of the main characters, his is the least inherently intriguing or necessary, so it was all on him to make the part fascinating, and, come to think of it, he affects less machismo than others, too, despite playing another tough-guy type role--instead employing the brutality in a caretaker capacity for the youths in his charge. When his Coach fights off a bunch of knife-wielding kids, he simultaneously and humorously exploits it as a teachable moment for them. Hunnam, meanwhile, seems to have merely changed outfits to play the same basic role he did over seven seasons of \"Sons of Anarchy,\" and now that we're accustomed to McConaughey not being a mere rom-com personality, this role doesn't appear challenging. He delivers monologues about being the king or whatever with the same gusto, or lack thereof, as those pretentious Lincoln car commercials.One more self-referential aspect here of Ritchie's oeuvre that's worth reflecting upon are the jokes here involving race and sexuality. I didn't think much of it watching the movie--just that they were comical asides. That Grant's character seems to be a bit of a predatory gay trope, but even that didn't cause much more than a raised eyebrow from me in a picture full of reprobates, including a heterosexual rape attempt, as well as the implication of what was done to a pig. As for race, there's a brief gag of a crime-movie Asian stereotype, for instance, there's Hunnam's character musing about \"white guilt\" at one point, and Farrell's Coach arguing at another to a young black boxer that a remark of him being \"black\" isn't racist. Again, nothing much there within the context of the picture itself except as perhaps a commentary on varying racial attitudes among such a cast of characters. But, then, I read some reviews for \"The Gentlemen,\" and, wow, what a self-righteous lot entertainment critics can be--and dull. I mean, obviously, Ritchie like every other filmmaker has his perspective and his films may appeal to one demographic over another, as with all films, so it seems rather witless to focus reviews on that when there's much more aesthetically and cinematically interesting going on. For one, in this light, those scenes are but another reflexive device, of a defense against or rebuttal to criticism of Richie's oeuvre, from Brad Pitt as a gypsy to \"The Gentlemen.\"",

The dialog was completely loaded with metaphors and zingers, the editing (and random use of b roll) was jarring and over-stylized, there was no character growth, the meta screenplay insert didn't add to the story at all, to name a few. The tone was intended to be fun, but there was hardly any room for that (aside from the on-foot chase scene, the gym guys' battle video, and Hugh Grant's quirkiness). The dramatic moments could of been a little more tense, but not a single one of the villains posed any sort of threat to the protagonists. The good guys kind of steam rolled through the turncoats and rival dealers. Everything worked out and it was super easy for them, which might be a first for a crime movie.The casting in the movie was excellent, but the character's motivations were so clean cut and obvious that the sense of mystery was essentially absent. The directing and acting shined. Yet, there was no momentum or character moments to really speak of; which, as a viewer, made the whole endeavor seem one-note.Other noteworthy aspects were the cinematography and soundtrack.

Oozing with style, populated with colourful characters & led by a star-studded ensemble, it doesn't score as high as his best-known works but it's still a fun ride.Written & directed by Guy Ritchie (Sherlock Holmes & The Man from U.N.C.L.E.), the introductions are swift, the premise set-up is quick & Ritchie's own brand of quirky wit is on display from the get-go. Although the story is promising at first, its self-indulgent quality & forced twists diminish the interest as plot progresses. There are some positives, however.The sophisticated set pieces, kinetic camerawork, consistent pace & lighthearted vibe, all work out in its favour. And then, there are good performances that lift it above a notch. Matthew McConaughey & Hugh Grant impress the most, with the former brandishing his natural charisma with flair. And they are finely supported by Charlie Hunnam & Collin Farrell who chip in with fab inputs of their own.Overall, The Gentlemen might please some & infuriate others with its unabashed treatment but considering Guy Ritchie's past couple outings, it's an improvement for sure.

Its funny (in a dark way), very involving and keeps you guessing while at the same time glued to the screen. This Guy Ritchie's movie in every way. The only downside of this movie was probably the ending with a bit to much revelations and double cons and triple cons. But even that left me at the end with a big smile on my face. What a superbly entertaining movie. And to ad at the end - Colin Farrell's Coach should have a spin off movie one day - it is that good.",

They look like they have zero idea how to survive in the world without servants & money...

            "content": "The Gentlemen is a new crime film action directed, partly written and produced by Guy Ritchie, the director of Aladdin, Sherlock Holmes, and Snatch.In the film, the American expat Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) wants to stop his profitable drug empire and there are rumors that he wants to sell this. However, if one of his drug plantations is sabotaged and robbed, his entire empire loses its value. Private detective Fletcher (Hugh Grant) tells Pearson his security man Ray (Charlie Hunnam) that he has information about who might be responsible for sabotage and theft. He asks a lot of money for this information and Ray is not even sure if the information is reliable. Fletcher keeps visiting Ray again and again to gain his confidence and to show that he has the correct information. In the meantime, Ray tries to do his own research to find out who is responsible for the actions to please his boss and so not to have to buy Fletcher information unnecessarily for a ridiculously high amount.\nWith this film, Guy Ritchie managed to direct his own film again, as he did at the start of his director's career with the films Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. After these films, he directed more films where he had to follow a certain direction for the films and elements of the stories. This was the case with the Sherlock Holmes, the King Arthur: Legend of the Sword and the live-action Aladdin films. With these films his freedom and creativity were somewhat limited, but with the Gentlemen he has regained this freedom and creativity. That he did not get this freedom and creativity for some years can unfortunately be seen in this new film from him. He has made a somewhat chaotic story of it. In this film, many different story lines play together. The film is also filled with characters who all try to sabotage each other or scam each other in the hope of being able to get hold of the profitable drug empire itself. As a viewer, you have to pay attention and keep your attention to the film to be able to keep following the story, because the different story lines are mixed at a rapid pace. At the end of the film, some of these storylines have not really had any meaning for the film either, and so ultimately come across as time-wasting storylines that have only made the film unnecessarily lengthy.The cast does a good job in the film, but due to the size of the cast they are not all equally important. The film focuses primarily on the characters of Charlie Hunnam and Hugh Grant who tell each other the same events from the film and see whose story is most logical and credible. Other actors such as Matthew McConaughey, Colin Farrell and Mitchelle Dockery also play more smaller roles, some of which actually didn't matter at the end of the film.",

I couldn't disagree more. Lock Stock and Snatch are two of my favourite movies of all time and when i heard Ritchie was going back to his British gangster roots i couldn't have been more happier .This is the story of Mickey Pearson is an American who became rich by building a marijuana empire in London. When word gets out that he's looking to cash out of the business, it soon triggers an array of plots and schemes from those who want his fortune.Firstly i'll say that The Gentlemen isn't quite up to the standard of Snatch or Lockstock but it does have a better story line than both of those films.\nSome of the characters are superb and the stand out performers are Hugh Grant as Fletcher , who ironically plays a sleazy journalist and Colin Farrell who plays coach who runs a boxing club . I found the first hour lacking a little in humour but as the story unfolds , so do the laughs and the action.If i had be critical i would say that Mathew McConaughey probably looks a little bit out of place in the film. It feels like he was cast to put a big American name on the poster . Another problem i have is Charlie Hunnam . The man cannot do accents ( Just watch Green Street!) . I have no idea what accent he was attempting here but it sounded like a mixture of Liverpudlian , Cockney , Yorkshire and American .I really enjoyed The Gentlemen and i hope Guy Ritchie sticks to what he does best in the future and takes no notice of the sniffy critics . I have the feeling this is one of those movies that i'll enjoy watching multiple times over the years as i tend to do with Guy Ritchie's work.",

I'm just happy Guy Ritchie has returned to his original form, the genre of crime comedy - which is also why the aforementioned critics seem to dislike it... Yes, \"The Gentleman\" is not breaking any new grounds, but oh man it is fun to watch.Ritchie puts on the table a new spiritual relative to his movies \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\", \"Snatch\", \"Rocknrolla\" & \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\", a crime comedy so slick and lively that it's impossible not to like it. At least let the audience's rating show that. \"The Gentleman\" is a story about Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), an american who built a marijuana empire in the Britain and is now tired of it, he tries to sell it to another american billionaire Matthew (Jeremy Strong), and guess what - all hell breaks loose in the criminal world around them. A whole bunch of awesome characters, crackling dialogue, amusing scenes, a few cool action sequences, the whole runtime tags along nice and smooth. The beginning or the first half is a tad bit slower than the rest of it & for some time I had fears of accurately predicting the end result, but, of course, the second half includes a whole lotta Ritchie shenanigans. Performances are a treat to watch, McConaughey delivers the goods as usual, but highlights also include Charlie Hunnam (whose character and performance might just be my favorite here, it came more as a surprise) and Hugh Grant, whom I could hardly compare to the other roles I've seen him do. Goes without saying that the rest of the cast is on the same level, never an average performance in a Guy Ritchie crime flick. \"The Gentleman\" is also tastefully filmed, no complaints about the aesthetical decisions, and props for the low-key awesome intro sequence. Also, I can always expect to steal a few songs from Guy's crime movies, \"The Gentleman\" did the exact opposite of a disappointment in that matter.Whereas enough people see \"The Gentleman\" as an old-shtick in new clothes, I see the type of stuff I've always expected from Ritchie since my 9th birthday when I saw \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrells\" for the first time. \"The Gentleman\" is fun, playful, contains top tier performances, and is undeniably entertaining. Let the next from Ritchie be just as fun! My rating: 9/10.",

Perhaps one has been spoiled by Tarantino movies ? What must be said however, is that it is still a fun film.Matthew McConaughey is good as always. Charlie Hunnam and Colin Farrel brings out quite fine performances as well. Hugh Grant is however the star of The Gentlemen, and he's just so damn slimy and spitting out so many comedically absurd statements that you just can't help but smile when he is let loose.The choice of music is perfect. A little favorite of mine; David Rawlings - \"Cumberland Gap\".At times, I think there is simply too much dialouge, which led to some confusion in following the plot. \"Who's side is he on, wait what why did he do that?\" my thoughts could be summarized as during those moments. Still, the movie does not lack funny moments, and I think they serve as \"redeemers\".To conclude; The Gentlemen is a fun movie with fine acting, but unfortunately it is for me lacking in some departments. If you like crime comedies however, this film is definitely for you.70/100",

            "content": "I've always been a defender of Guy Ritchie. He's made a couple of sub-par films (I think we should all just erase King Arthur out of our collective memory) but when he's on his game, very few can touch him. He might not have been the pioneer of British gangster films but he's the notable name for it. The Gentlemen is him flexing his creative muscles, instead of just carbon copying Snatch or Lock & Stock, he made some interesting creative choices in this. The Gentlemen had his style but it was updated and modern, and it had the same flair yet brought something fresh to the table. Does it get a little pretentious and precious? Yes, it absolutely does. The dialogue and the style is largely gold but I think Guy could have used someone looking over his shoulder and telling him to tighten it up a little. Some of the 5 minute speeches may have been more effective at 3:30 instead but in a movie so filled with memorable one-liners or fun scenes, this is a minor point of contention. I was genuinely impressed that he went the extra mile to present us with something unique.While McConaughey is the first featured in the credits, the ensemble here is surprisingly big and full of famous players. It took me a little while to get used to McConaughey in this role, with The Gentlemen being so overtly British, he's just doing McConaughey in the middle of it. But as the movie went on, you realize how fantastic of an actor he is and his casting seems more natural. Hugh Grant probably has the next most screen time, he's playing against type and while he's hamming it up a little, it was fun watching him do something so different. Charlie Hunnam is surprisingly effective, I've always liked him, he just hasn't had much luck picking movie projects. He's got a lot of screen presence though and this was a reminder that when he's well cast, he's a capable leading actor. My favourite performance was Colin Farrell as Coach, Farrell is a lot of fun and has good comedic chops when he's not being pretty boy Colin Farrell (he's also fantastic in the underrated Horrible Bosses). He had me cracking up whenever he was on screen. Henry Golding continues to rise as Dry Eye, this was a new direction for him and he has more range than just being a romantic comedy lead. I would also note Michelle Dockery as Mickey's beautiful wife Rosalind. She's a well written and fairly realistic character and Michelle does a great job portraying her.While I talked about the updated style, I also want to credit writer/director Guy Ritchie for turning out the great dialogue he usually does. The script here could have just been recycled but the plot has a couple of twists you don't expect (within reason, its tough with this kind of film, you are only introduced to so many characters) and the dialogue is chock full of interesting one-liners and memorable exchanges. There were several points where I was cackling, a lot of them came from Coach. Its very non PC but it fits the culture of the people in the movie.I didn't love The Gentlemen right of the bat but by the time I hit the halfway point, I was absolutely in. It also helped that the ending was handled well. There were a few surprises, some tense moments and some chuckles to be had. I'm glad I got to see it in theatres and I absolutely recommend you do the same. My rating is actually between an 8-9 but I must round down in this case. I hope more people end up going to see it and I applaud Ritchie and his team for returning to form in this release",

Basically, American businessman Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) has formed a highly profitable marijuana empire in London and across England. The drugs kingpin is looking to cash out his business, and when the words gets out, several schemes, bribes and blackmails are triggered in an attempt to steal his domain. It is reported that Pearson has been shot dead, and private eye and aspiring screenwriter Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is employed by a newspaper to investigate. He visits Pearson's right-hand man Ray (Nicholas Nickleby's Charlie Hunnam) and threatens to expose the empire, he tells a full-length detailed backstory of the origins of the business, up until the present. This includes the many hidden marijuana plantations across the countryside, and Pearson's wife Rosalind (Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery) being part of key decisions. Fletcher also details the many characters behind the scenes, including Coach (Colin Farrell), or trying to take it away, including Dry Eye (Henry Golding). The British crime underworld is close to exposure, but all is not as it seems, and Pearson may not actually be dead. Also starring Jeremy Strong as Cannabis King Matthew, Eddie Marsan as Mike, Jason Wong and Phuc and Jordan Long as Barman. McConaughey gives a good performance as the yank head honcho, there is good support from Hunnam, Dockery and Golding, but this film is pretty much taken by Grant, who with his cockney accent, goatee beard and sunglasses outshines all. It is nice of Ritchie to return his geezers gangsters and guns origins, but let's be honest, it is a bit of a rehash of what we've seen before, the dialogue is witty, there are amusing moments, and the editing is clever, but overall it just feels meh, an average action crime drama.

Matthew McConaughey may be the glamour boy, but Hugh Grant steals the show as a mercenary journalist trying to hawk secrets to both sides. Grant's career is on an upswing since he impersonated Jeremy Thorpe (also playing for two teams!). His posh accent totally disappears into 'Estuary English', as does Michelle Dockery's as Mickey's tough-cookie wife: I nearly fainted when Downton's Lady Mary used the C-word.Everyone uses the C-word. THE GENTLEMEN is lewd, crude, and viciously violent. But mercilessly gripping. This may be Ritchie's best movie.",

I felt the trailer was awful, and having lived through the boom of awful British Gangster movies that followed \"Lock Stocks\" success and wasn't particularly interested in more Mockney accented violence. So, it's remarkable then that \"The Gentlemen\" won me over.Investigative journalist Fletcher (Hugh Grant) lays out his upcoming expose' about Marijuana baron Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) to Pearson's consiglieri Ray (Charlie Hunnam) in an attempt to secure a bribe to kill the story. Pearson is looking to retire and sell his production and distribution networks to Matthew (Jeremy Strong) but his decision has encouraged other players in the market to step up.The humour was eventually the Trojan horse that won me over. It took a while to warm to Hugh Grant's Fletcher, so camp and letchy it's somehow so far beyond the realms of offensive and back out the other side, that you can't help but laugh at some of the things he says - and that's true of a lot of the film, plenty of moments in isolation would be appalling, but somehow the sheer volume of swearwords, stereotypes and violence overwhelms those feelings to the point you can't begin to take it seriously and start to laugh. And crucially, it's 'with' the film, rather than 'at' it. All this feels like a deliberate choice, rather than an accident - which I think stems from the fact that Ritchie was doing this two decades ago.It doesn't all work though. Charlie Hunnam is as terrible here as he is in everything but this time is saddled by an accent that could be . . .well, anything really . . . Welsh? The twists towards the end are a little more predictable than I would have liked and I'm not sure my justifications from the previous paragraph works for the potential rape scene.That said, I enjoyed the film, as did the majority of the screening that I was in, based on the laughs - and Colin Farrell earns a whole star here just on his own.",

Lots of funny lines and exchanges, which get only better when you think about how the actors felt on set trying to deliver those, Farrell is amazing in this, he looks so adorable in his 40ties dressed as a 20 y.o.I'm 100% sure that no one could've made this script work but Ritchie. He does this good balance of childish nonsense and engaging story (with predictable twists, but still). All the main characters were likable enough to care for them, and even though they were not deep enough they still feel like they have some personality to them and that's great.Some of the stuff in the film was weird, like the message that heroin is bad and it kills people but weed is fine or something and some gay undertones, but most of the time it's just pure brainless entertainment.Never change, Guy Ritchie, never change.",

It's another kinda dark, gritty, bloody, messy but quite enjoyable piece by Guy.Set in UK, it follows different narrative than usual for storytelling sake and it can be quite fun, somewhat predictable but fun. It gives you feeling like you are in the third person there and watching show that just keeps giving something to hold onto and keep you interested. There is also plenty of humor that sometimes is childish but mostly is pretty good and fits the scenes.The moment when you see tracksuit guys you in for the ride, there is no doubt that they will fail as they are absolutely wacky characters and perform things that you would expect from them. Colin Farrell being one of them is mesmerising, you can watch him speak with his accent and it's great. His character (Coach) will leave you laughing to your bones cause it's bloody dark and beautiful comedy if you have that kind of wiring for humor.Now the rest of guys are also pretty good, starting with McCounaghey playing our lead (Mickey Pearson). He is great you can't hold anything against him because he's a go guy for these kind of things also Hunnam playing Ray is tough, scary, funny and just a gold to watch. Hugh Grant is also pretty good at what he does sometimes you would wish his character (Fletcher) was a bit smarter but he fits at his place.Writing and telling this story is just classical Guy Ritchie style that even if you didn't know it was him that did this you would probably guess him if you saw any of his movies. His directing skills and writing are pretty much all the same but in this movie he has a bit different approach to certain things and there are instances where he magnifies humor with them which is greatly appreciated.It's funny, back to his roots movie with bloody and confrontational scenes that yell its crime comedy even though it's not what you might expect but it is very enjoyable. 3.5/4",

            "review_title": "An entertaining return to that classic Guy Ritchie style of British gangster eccentricism",
            "content": "The Gentlemen is a crime comedy film written and directed by Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Aladdin). Starring Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Colin Farrell, and Hugh Grant, it is an entertaining return to that classic Guy Ritchie style of British gangster eccentricism that has been missing for quite some time.In London, Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a charismatic American drug kingpin who specialises in cannabis, attempts to sell off his business for $400,000,000 so he can retire in peace. After first offering the position to billionaire Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong), Mickey attracts the attention of Chinese gangster Dry Eye (Henry Golding), who tries to buy out the business for a considerably lower asking price, much to Mickey's displeasure. As a result of this, word gets out among the world's crime syndicates as various other high ranking racketeers pursue ways to steal Mickey's empire out from under him.Much like \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" and \"Snatch\" before it, \"The Gentlemen\" wears its distinct British flavour on its sleeve as we are treated to an erratic and sometimes darkly funny look into the London criminal underworld. The unapologetic approach it takes to depicting violence, drug use, and political incorrectness will prove highly off-putting to any newcomers to the director's work but anyone longing for a return to the style of the aforementioned films will be greatly satisfied. It certainly feels refreshing to watch a movie that isn't afraid to push the boundaries of what would be considered appropriate for a modern gangster film, especially without seeming like it is trying too hard.After experiencing something of a creativity drought in recent years, Guy Ritchie comes back with a vengeance, bringing his trademark fast paced editing and unmistakable British charm to a film much more suited to his personal preferences. Anyone who has seen his early work will remember that he will often punctuate a violent scene with tongue-in-cheek comic relief to help ease the audience through the severity of what they have just witnessed. There were a number of times where I laughed out loud at some of these moments, sometimes out of shock and sometimes out of the genuine comedic value on display. In addition, Ritchie's storytelling technique also remains the same, in that you really need to pay attention to every intricate detail of a character's actions to fully understand the entire plot. There are the odd blink-and-you-miss-it moments where I failed to understand something and needed to look it up later on but they didn't feel as punishing to the viewer as in some of the director's previous films. Once you get used to this style, Ritchie's films take on a unique life of their own and begin to feel as though they exist within their own custom-made universe.Being an ensemble cast, each of the main actors shine in their own unique ways. Matthew McConaughey of course stands out as the main American in a predominantly British gangster world, exuding an unflappable confidence as he does business in a foreign land. Charlie Hunnam brings an intimidating stance to his role as McConaughey's right-hand man, often striking fear in other characters merely due to his presence in the room. Colin Farrell, while not receiving as much screen time as the rest of his co-stars, is his usual Irishman self with a penchant for saying the odd witty quip at the end of a scene. However, the role that surprised me the most was an almost unrecognisable Hugh Grant as a heavily-accented private detective. It actually took me a moment to realise it was even him near the beginning of the film but once I did I was treated to one of his best performances to date. I only wish he'd played roles like this much earlier in his career, as opposed to being typecast as the mild mannered Englishmen in romantic comedies but I suppose it's better late than never I guess.As it stands, \"The Gentlemen\" may not leave as much of an impression on audiences as Guy Ritchie's earlier films but it still makes for a worthy addition to his filmography. There is definitely much to enjoy in seeing a filmmaker creating something for audiences who appreciate the craft of his work in spite of the failures and near-misses throughout his career. If anything, it proves that even after more than twenty years in the film business, he still has plenty more surprises for us to look forward to.I rate it 8/10",

            "content": "Well, it certainly seems as if Guy Ritchie has got his groove back, but then again I am one of those people that feel that he never quite lost it, namely because I did quite like King Arthur. Anyway, with this film he is back in familiar territory, namely the English Criminal underworld with a cast of anti-heroes. Yeah, that is the type of film that I loved, and this one, well, this one certainly doesn't disappoint.So, we have this American, Mickey Pearson, that won a Rhodes Scholarship and moved over to England. However, while at university he got into the drug dealing scene, namely marijuana, and he basically never looked back (oh, did I mention that he was also studying botany - why not?). However, the movie shifts to a time where he has decided that he will retire and wants to off load his business.That is basically all I am going to tell you about the plot, though I have to admit the his syndicate is really craftily constructed because, well, being a former Oxbridge student means that he made some pretty good connections, and he also learnt how to move in their world, which basically sets himself up among the upper classes of England.One of the great things I love about Ritchie's films is that he doesn't shy away from the use of accents. Yeah, we hear the English, Cockney, and American accents quite well - I suspect that he does this on purpose. Yet, in another way it not only adds a lot of shine to the film, but it also gives the characters greater depth than those films were the actors do away with them.Oh, and I should mention that true to Ritchie's style, there are lots of twists and turns in the film, and of course a lot of black comedy. Sure, it ain't no Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but if you loved that film then you are probably going to really enjoy this one as well. Honestly, expect the unexpected.",

All the rest he has done since varied from ok to mediocre to poor to ok again but this entry in his filmography has unexpectedly taken a crown as being the best in it so far. The Gentlemen is a perfect blend of everything Mr Ritchie is known for - non-linear plot, twists and turns here and there, rich narrative and outstanding dialogues with tons of jokes, great performances from top notch actors - shout out to Colin Farrell and Charlie Hunnam for stealing most of the spotlight in this near perfect spectacle of a movie; I have to admit the first 10-15 minutes is a slowburner but after that there are balls of fire all the way. Although The Gentlemen offers almost nothing new or something we havent't seen before it brings Ritchie's formula of a great movie to a sheer perfection and makes you enjoy every single second, catch every single line and hit the replay button once the movie's over.",

Mickey runs a hugely successful marijuana empire in England and looks to sell it to the highest bidder. All the while, various outside influencers attempt to steal it from under his nose. That's the plot in a nutshell although there's many more strands that are great to discover on your first watch. I loved particular sequences in this one and really liked it overall! The plot is presented to us initially through Fletcher, a slimy private detective with plenty of dirt on the other characters in the story, with Hugh Grant on incredible form in a role we haven't really seen him do before. His frequent cinematic musings on the story that he has been following for some time is told beautifully through Ritchie's trademark dialogue which is the key highlight here combined with the performances. Mcconaughey provides an unorthodox 'good guy' and has a lot of fun in the role portraying someone genuinely menacing but also with clear morals in his business and a man who deeply loves his wife Rosalind (Michelle Dockery) who is also fantastic here. Colin Farrell is fantastically funny and badass in his role as Coach which also can be said for everyone in this movie; they take on the roles and effortlessly convey coolness! I was most impressed however with Charlie Hunham as Ray, a man with obsessive compulsive disorder yet when he's placed into a difficult situation to retrieve a clients daughter in a place he would prefer to avoid, he completely commands the situation and it makes for compelling viewing. The plot is very hard to follow in the first act and almost feels like you're having to catch up with what's going on straight away, but once you get into the flow with the characters, it's consistently entertaining, deliciously dark and absolutely hilarious, beautifully edited by James Herbert and a must see return to the British crime genre from one of the masters",

He hasn't been able to capture the magic of Snatch ever since that film but thankfully, Ritchie went back to the drawing board and gave us The Gentlemen.The Gentlemen centers around Mickey Pearson, an American born marijuana kingpin, who's trying to sell off his business in London leading to a chain of events involving blackmail and schemes.Guy Ritchie's recent films like Aladdin have been disappointing me so it was very satisfying to see him back in his element with The Gentlemen. It felt really to see him go back to doing what he does best and I had a lot of fun with this film. This is Guy Ritchie at his most Guy Ritchie. The script is as snappy as you would expect from him with dialogues that flow very beautifully. They come at you fast and include some great moments that are hilarious. One of the things I enjoyed was the meta aspect to the film. There's a whole element where Hugh Grant is writing a script on the events that take place and the references to the filmmaking was fun to watch. Like Snatch, this film paces at breakneck speed. The film moves so quick that I feel like it needed to slow down at times to give some breathing space for the audience. The story has many twists and turns and the fast pacing can make it difficult to keep up with everything.The cast that Ritchie assembled for this film is amazing. Matthew McConaughey is excellent here as Mickey Pearson. Jeremy Strong, Eddie Marsan and Henry Golding all do a great job as well. Michelle Dockery is great but I wish more was done with her character. The standouts in my opinion were Hugh Grant, Charlie Hunnam and Colin Farrell. Hugh Grant was very entertaining to watch and the witty dialogue he was given added so much to the fun of his character. This is the best I've seen Charlie Hunnam in a film. I loved his calm demeanour but he was also someone you wouldn't want to mess with. Colin Farrell was absolutely hilarious and gave another strong performance. I was also surprised to see Bugzy Malone here but I thought he did well. There's one amazing sequence with him and Farrell that had me laughing out loud.Whilst The Gentlemen doesn't reach the levels of Snatch, it's still an entertaining watch and a return to form for Guy Ritchie. I hope Ritchie continues making flicks like this as this is where he plays to his strengths.",

            "content": "Just came back from the theater and I have to say it was a fun ride with some solid acting and cinematography.So personally I'm not all to familiar with Guy Ritchie's films, but if anything I feel like I know his style from seeing this movie, and it's really enjoyable for the most part. This movie really likes to play with modern toys of editing and some cool visuals, like when Fletcher and Ray are talking about movie formats. It's fun and different from the traditional stuff and I like that.Now, first off the Directing, really solid with some really pretty shots in the film. Most of the movie is very static, camera on a tripod kinda style, but once there's action it goes loose, really making stuff chaotic and pulling you out from the serenity. It doesn't go overboard with cuts and crazy camera shake though, that's a good thing, its very well balanced and the violence is visceral and engaging. I already addressed it a bit but this movie can be really pretty at times, great color grading and set design.Acting was fantastic in this, my only issues were with Hugh Grant and Hunnam, the latter being a bit wooden/flat at times, but with does have some highs. Grant was the comedic relief and he did okay, sometimes it just felt a bit out there. Standouts where Colin Farrell and McConaughey, great stuff. Dialog was good too, definitely has some funny moments written in that worked well, and the harsher lines worked great too.Music, don't always address this but what there was was good and effective, and some really interesting choices, loved it.Now story, this is where most of my negatives come from. The movie starts with a cold open where Michael gets shot (you assume). It's fun and gets you into the movie nice and fast, then it's slowly burns up till about the last 20 or so minutes. During that slow burn there was some fun but a lot of it was setting storylines up, backgrounds and characters. The point of the movie where it got to slow for me was the scene before they threw that russian kid out the window (we'll get to that later). There was just so much buildup to a really short scene without a strong payoff in the scene itself, they decided to cut the plummeting of the russian kid which took me out of it for a bit. The movie does this a lot by the way, it likes to have ''cliffhangers'' which the way it tells the story, sometimes this works great, other times, not so much. Then we get to the finale, first off Matthew doesn't get a full ending and resolve, so we have to assume he transferred the money and did the deed, which is a bit lacking.Then comes the russian out of nowhere, so far we had some great backstory to most of our characters, but Atlas(?) the russian kid thrown out the roof, apparently had a rich dad which ended up putting a hit on Pearson. This came way too fast and outta nowhere, felt like it needed a small scene or 2 to establish this russian guy was actually mad/seeking revenge.Third, the ''you didn't play me, I played you! trope'' got used which is okay if there are clues sprinkled in the movie, but there weren't, not once did we know Ray was outsmarting Fletcher besides the one on one dialog maybe where we can sense some confidence but that's reaching. It was actually shown that Ray WASN'T that smart with his encounter with the kid who's phone he needed. And after that you're telling me he's in a ghillie suit spying on the professional detective spying on them? The whole movie is about tying up loose ends and connecting the dots, and it missed a few dots so to say, not dramatically though, the story is still strong, just felt a tiny bit rushed.At the end of the day I still really enjoyed the movie, fun fact with all the killing and crime, not a single cop in this movie, just a casual mention or two.For me 7.5/10 , would recommend.",

            "review_title": "\"The American Lion in the English Jungle\"",
            "content": "\"The American Lion in the English Jungle\"Guy Ritchie returns to both the writing and directing chair to craft an exciting action-filled comedy that only he and he alone could create. \"The Gentlemen\" stars a wide array of talent that perfectly bring Ritchie's patented expressive dialogue to life with every word they utter. The excitement in this film is not solely found in the action and gunshots that were heavily marketed but is instead felt within the elaborate narrative that keeps at a steady pace, along with the eccentric characters that help shepherd it along. Ritchie's style bleeds throughout this film's core from the very opening title credits, to the final cut to black; all of his standard trademarks are here which some may find tiresome, while others will find great enjoyment out of. Nevertheless, it should go without saying that with Ritchie in the driver's seat \"The Gentlemen\" is an immensely entertaining film that will keep audiences engaged in its wonderful world of formalized chaos.\n\"The Gentlemen\" centers around the suave Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a kingpin that reigns over his established marijuana empire as he navigates throughout London attempting to remain on top, despite the many adversarial forces he faces along the way (But it is far more complex than that). A private investigator known only as Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is hired by Big Dave (Eddie Marsan), an editor for the Daily Print tabloid with the strict assignment of investigating Pearson's personal ties to a royal named Lord Pressfield (Samuel West). During the course of his investigation, Fletcher uncovers several secrets shrouded in mystery and deception. It is realized, that Pearson is fully intent on selling his business to the American billionaire, Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong) for a grand sum of $400 million. However, at the exact same time, a young Chinese crime boss named, Dry Eye (Henry Golding) is looking to relieve Pearson of the stress by outright buying the entire establishment. When Pearson refuses, he and his wife Rosalind Pearson (Michelle Dockery) along with his right-hand man Raymond (Charlie Hunnam) are thrust into a world of chaos where they are the primary targets everyone is aimed at. Having said that, it should be noted that the first two-thirds of the film are framed within a late-night conversation Fletcher invites Raymond to, with regards to his findings. Fletcher fully intends on selling his discoveries to Raymond in exchange for \u00c2\u00a320 million or he will go to print, a simple blackmail technique.\nRitchie provides an exhilarating screenplay that keeps audiences glued to their seats guessing where it will go next and just when you think you've figured it out, the film takes a complete detour of absurdity that most would fail in their attempts The film rarely stops to take a break which on paper may seem like a real flaw; but for \"The Gentlemen\" it is not. The narrative is told by the character of Fletcher and it feels extremely meta, so much so that a poster of one of Ritchie's previous projects can be spotted for keen eyes. This type of narrative structure is a technique that some may find distracting and unfocused, but I personally find it to be brilliant. After the beautiful opening credits, we are instantly thrown into a shocking moment that immediately grabs your attention like a salacious headline; it is hard to forget. With this inciting moment now lodged in our brains, the audience becomes hyper-focused as they watch in awe eagerly waiting for that fatal moment to come back; and when it finally does, it is just as shocking as it was when we first witnessed it. Although this is a method used by many writers and directors, Ritchie pulls it off in a way that does not entirely spoil the film from the offset. With the film's events unfolding through Fletcher's recounting of the situations, as an actual written screenplay titled, \"Bush\" you cannot help but be fully captivated. The constant callbacks to past incidents and shifts of perspective all add to create a story that is one of the most entertaining ones of the year.\"The Gentlemen\" as I expressed earlier, is a film constructed by an auteur that relishes in a flashy, yet extravagant style that only he could design. From a very entry-level observation, the first thing that will catch anyone's attention are the elaborate and debonair outfits everyone on the cast, dons. Regardless of whether it is a fresh tapered suit, a loose-fitting jacket, or a bold tracksuit, every character showcased on-screen displays a level of sophistication only Guy Ritchie could pull off. Every shoe, every top, every pair of glasses; every single article of clothing appears to have been hand-picked as a means of painting each individual cast member as a figure you will not soon forget. Surprisingly, this quality is not exclusive to only the main cast as many of the extras also have a unique visual flavor that brings more life into every moment. When the film travels from scene to scene, the characters look fantastic, but so is the dialogue they are speaking. Ritchie's use of language is rather impressive as none of his characters are presented as shallow one-trick ponies. Every line of dialogue is pointed with a purpose that perfectly sets the stakes for every scene as all of the actors and actresses are constantly vying to dominate the verbal battles they find themselves in. With metaphors and jokes littered all throughout, it is hard to not find all of the English accents just a bit endearing. Unfortunately, on the flip side, because of how animated the characters and their words can be at times, they will occasionally slip into the territory of a cartoonish caricature of themselves. It is not distinctively a fault of the film that ruins it by any means, but it can be a bit overwhelming from time to time (A sentiment that is true for the entirety of the film).\n\"The Gentlemen\" is a blast of a film that explodes with character and features a fabulous cast that all bring their best. From the costumes and sets to the characters and their dialogue, Ritchie's fingerprints are all over this film and it appears as though he is playing in a wheelhouse where he feels the most comfortable. Now of course, if you are not a fan of Guy Ritchie's films or his overabundant style, then \"The Gentlemen\" may not be your cup of tea. However, the story and visual flair used to present it, flows throughout every frame and is certainly something that will entertain from beginning to end. Truly the first must-watch of 2020.Final Verdict - B-",

His English crime thrillers are so spectacularly entertaining that you are always having a good time watching them and time just flies by. I think the secret lies in the writing, with the creation of unforgettable side characters to his very elaborate stories. I mean who can forget Vinnie Jones in both Lock Stock and Snatch, or Brad Pitt in Snatch? Here it's Hugh Grant and Collin Farrell that steal the show, so much so that McConaughey's protagonist is a bit one dimensional and forgettable. But almost every other character is really good and has a moment to shine. One almost forgets that it's been twelve years since his last foray into the genre with RocknRolla, and more than twenty since Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels exploded to the screen. He has been a bit lost trying to build a successful franchise in Hollywood, and after some not so well received movies he came back to familiar ground and knocked it out of the park.

            "content": "For a guy that loves movies, I do have my favorite and least favorite genres. One of those least favorite genres are mob movies. It has nothing to do with the explicit content or their morals. I just don't find them as engaging as a shoot-em-up western, hilarious comedy, or a fantastical science fiction. A lot of it has to do with the overall dialogue and plot structure. They play out like soap operas where family members and friends will get on board, but then betray those around them, usually whenever it's very convenient for the story to progress forward.That's not to say I dislike mafia stories in general. I'll even admit that The Godfather, Scarface, The Departed, Casino, Goodfellas, and the recent The Irishman are all incredible works of art. I think it has to do with how people try to imitate mobs, only to come off boring. The key to making them work, especially for me, is the really make the characters engaging and worth caring for. In something like The Godfather, you consistently feel sorry for Al Pacino who got dragged into the family business. So let's see what The Gentlemen has to offer.In England, an American crime boss Mickey Pearson (played by Matthew McConaughey) runs a successful drug business that he's in the process of trying to sell for $400 million dollars. All he wants is to retire with his wife Rosalind (played by Michelle Dockery). But along with overall process of hiding it, an underboss for the Chinese mafia, Dry Eye (played by Henry Golding) offers to purchase the drug business, but is rejected. At the same time, one of the hidden drug labs is vandalized and raided by amateur boxers who film their encounter and post it on social media as a part of a rap video.This angers the boxer's coach...named Coach (played by Colin Farrell) who offers his services to Mickey's underboss Raymond. This leads Coach into capturing members of the Chinese mafia to try and intimidate them into leaving them alone. Of course, this only entices them to get more violent with their methods. On top of all this, Big Dave (played by Eddie Marsan), who's the editor of the Daily Print tabloid, hires a private investigator Fletcher (played by Hugh Grant) to dig into this criminal underworld. It just so happens that Fletcher also wants to try and make some blackmail money.The Gentlemen certainly has a lot of characters and plots to get through. I didn't even list smaller parts. That's why I'm glad to say that I was very entertained by The Gentlemen. Director Guy Richie (Sherlock Holmes, Aladdin) tends to use a lot of plot within his stories and can be hit or miss. He seems to love making these mob movies as they can take advantage of that. Where The Gentlemen succeeds is it's characters as I found them to be interesting and balances things by showing off lower and higher class gangsters. It may not be the first, but something about it here feels distinct.This is another movie where the casting is perfect. I can't call them deep characters, but each actor, whether it's Matthew McConaughey, Hugh Grant, or Henry Golding, they all do a good job bringing a balance of intimidating and funny. I would count the film as a comedy (I'm not even going to spoil what happens to Hugh Grant's character), as a lot of the humor relies on whose trying to rip off who or who their trying to impress.Having said that, the movie can get a little too caught up in it's plots. While most I could follow, there were a lot that were either formulaic or just didn't go anywhere. An editing process probably would have helped make it tighter and focused. Plus you should know the movie does not follow a straightforward story. Because of this, you really need to pay attention to what's going on. This may turn off some people who just want to sit back and have fun. There's a lot of fun here too, though it'll help to keep tabs on whose who and what their doing.I'll give this eight tweed blazers out of ten. I'd say it'll have a good life on video and on the streaming platforms. If this sounds good, then I expect you'll enjoy this. It's teatime and The Gentlemen brings the mafia with it.",

Either way, that was the title of the screenplay of which this meta movie is based upon. This is Guy Richie's return to form in the genre of British gangster movies. This time, however, he places himself and the genre he mastered under a parody. This is a self-aware comedy about British gangster movie cliches. A deconstructed version of Snatch, if you will. I thought I'd grow very tired of the constant winking to the audience. Yet, this film doesn't just derive its humor through self-deprecation. It's one of the few comedies out there that feels truly free and alive. The dialogue flows so quick and gracefully, in that classic English way. It's just really funny throughout. I can also give the movie major props for doing three minor, but critical things that just pull everything together. One, this film might just have the only Hugh Grant performance that I didn't hate. Out with the bashful, handsome dope, in with a foul-mouthed, pitch perfect impersonation of Michael Caine. Two, this film might hold the record for the most times the C-Word was used in dialogue, and yet, so classily that you could barely notice it. Three, this film rehabilitates the Miramax brand. Miramax was founded, and permanently tainted by Harvey Weinstein. To see it return here, under new management, is a fascinating conversation all it's own.",

            "content": "Guy Ritchie started his career with a bang: \"Lock, stock & Two Smoking Barrels\" (1998) and \"Snatch\" (2000) defined a genre and solidified a very unique style of doing British gangster films. They were messier, faster and bolder than their American counterparts but still powered with great scripts and powerful performances.\nIt also created a faithful legion of fans who loved Richie's first two features enough to disregard a streak of subpar films after that and still keep looking forward to any new film he put out.Being one of those fans, my expectations to \"The Gentlemen\" were still high and I sat down expecting to watch a true Guy Ritchie film, if not as good as the first two hits, at least something that could make them justice. After all, he was finally returning to the gangster genre and that was enough of a promise.I wasn't left disappointed. The film brought back many of his traits he had seemed to forgot how to use, presenting at the same time a more mature and cleaner style.\nI didn't have as much fun as with Snatch, but I felt entertained and at times drawn to that magic and filthy universe filled with violence, quirky characters, and politically incorrect racial and homophobic slurs - it's clear these are not ill intended, it's simply the world where this characters live in.Grant, McConaughey and Hunnam convincingly exchange jabs at each other, making the most of a very tongue in cheek script with some well directed moments of drama and a few well timed twists. There are also some minor but interesting perfomances by Collin Farrell and Michelle Dockery who seem to be well positioned to have a lot more screening time in any eventual sequel this might have.It's very satisfying to see Guy Ritchie closer to his prime! May he not lose the balance again.",

            "content": "Like Wes Anderson, Tim Burton and Michael Bay, you can tell when a film is made by Guy Ritchie just by watching a few minutes of it. The British director has carried a sense of hyper stylization through each of his films, most notably in crime comedies that began with the one-two punch of \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" and \"Snatch.\" Now, after a few big studio duds (\"King Arthur,\" \"Aladdin\"), Ritchie has come home to his roots with \"The Gentlemen.\"Growing tired of the marijuana business and fearing for the security of his future, Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) decides he wants to sell his lucrative empire. Luckily for him, a rich American buyer is willing to fork over a pretty penny. Unluckily for Mickey though, his life of crime has made him a few enemies that would like nothing more than to see him ruined. With his enemies fast approaching on all sides, Mickey will now have to get his hands dirtier than ever if he ever wants to have a chance to clean them off.\"The Gentlemen\" is business as usual for Ritchie as he dives right back into the street crime genre he made his name in.What may seem overindulgent to others is only conventional to Ritchie as he uses all the flashy tactics in the book. Even the opening credits - which contain numerous minor spoilers for some odd reason - remind one of a Bond film. After that, we are led on an endless parade of rapid editing, exaggerated characters and many other stylish facets. It's a bombardment of the senses, but one that never becomes overbearing.However, like all Ritchie films, \"The Gentlemen\" ends up leaning too hard on style over substance, which is saying a lot because there is a lot of substance here. Some directorial choices seem to be made only for vanity, such as one bit where a character drones on about the magic of classic cinema. I was reminded of the great \"Jurassic Park\" quote which I am paraphrasing: \"Ritchie was so preoccupied with whether or not he could; he didn't stop to think if he should.\"Such is the case in Ritchie's previous crime films: there are plots within plots, and those plots have plots on top of them. In this film, the narrative revolves around a discussion between two characters as one tells the other about the events that have unfolded. These events are new to us but have already happened within the timeframe of the film. What we get is a sort of comedic murder mystery where each event is changed and then rechanged again based upon a certain character's perspective on what happened.This framing device makes the movie an interesting puzzle, albeit a needlessly convoluted one. Specific details sometimes get lost in the shuffle, only to come back again to confuse us more. Just like the directing, this problem seems to stem from Ritchie's insistence on overdoing things. It's quantity over quality as too many things are thrown into the script without much regard for clarity or purpose.Since his Oscar win in 2014, Matthew McConaughey has had a hard time picking projects that use his acting strengths and that also turns out to be good. Thankfully, Mr. \"Alright, Alright, Alright\" chose wisely here as Ritchie uses his captivating screen presence in some impressive monologues.Charlie Hunnam and Hugh Grant play the two characters having a banterous discussion around the film's events. Grant easily takes the top spot between the two as he seems to thoroughly enjoy his character's eccentric quirks.Rounding out the cast is Jeremy Strong, Henry Golding and, most notably, Colin Farrell as a boxing coach simply named \"Coach.\" Even though Mickey is the main character, Coach is the one you'll remember the most after.It can be easy to forget sometimes that movies are allowed to solely be entertaining popcorn flicks. This rings truer during awards season when every film is trying to take a stand on something and fighting to make a mark on our culture.Of course, you still would like that popcorn flick to be well-made. Being as how January is usually a dumping ground for maligned films, you could do a lot worse than this enjoyable romp.",

You have to carefully manage your exit so you get out alive, cos it's much cheaper to take it over if the boss is dead.With Matthew David McConaughey wearing his r\u00c3\u00b4le like an well tailored suit, Hugh Grant as a sleazy blackmailing cockney ( leaving his plummy accent behind) and the rest of the cast fitting together like a jigsaw puzzle, you have some great working materialThe London crime scene is so much more intelligent than the North American shootfests we are used to, sort of like Downton Abbey against Dallas, and this movie cashes in on the intellectual nature of the criminals. They're all so smart!It's Guy Ritchie at his best, he explains things as the plot unfolds without breaking the storyline.He injects humour into nasty situations, pulls off plot twists that are perfectly believable and, something which is Ritchie's true talent, he makes the villains likeable.No woke undercurrents in this project, that I can tell you.... and I'm still trying to get over hearing Michelle Dockery using the \"f\" word.. something Lady Mary Crawley would faint over if she heard it.A few weak moments in the plot ( which is why I only rated it an 8 ) but you can expect that with the tangled stories that are the hallmarks of his films.Sit back and enjoy this one",

More recently, Ritchie's big-screen productions have been underwhelming - those who've seen Aladdin and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword will no doubt agree. However, The Gentlemen is more his style of flick, and does a good job getting back to his best (namely, plots he understands).I am not a massive gangster fan, I must admit; Peaky Blinders doesn't do it for me, nor did any of the Godfathers (they are slow and boring - come get me). Quirky gangster films, however, have enough comedy and lightheartedness in them that I don't feel myself drowning in overacting, so I went into this with an open mind. My reward was a colourful world, more colourful characters, and a half-decent plot that wasn't content to meander, but kept you guessing. Loosely, the story follows Matthew McConaughey's Ricky, a drugs lord wanting out the game by selling his empire to the highest bidder. There are several interested parties with offers on the table, but nothing in the criminal underworld is as straightforward as that.The star of the film isn't the big-billed actors: it's not McConaughey (who, by the way, needs to be taught how to pronounce \"pint\" - I don't know why, but he actually butchered this one word ordering a drink at the start of the film), nor is it Charlie Hunnam as Ray, the right-hand man of the kingpin. No, the real gem in this film is none other than HUGH GRANT. I don't really watch romcoms, so I haven't seen him act before (to be fair, nobody who's seen him in a romcom has seen him act properly either), but Grant is exceptional as a sleazy reporter doing his best to earn a bit before everything goes mad. He is equal parts funny and sordid, and is the ideal foil to a plot that is guilty of occasionally taking itself too seriously.One casting issue I did have was, to be fair to Ritchie, always going to be a gamble: Bugzy Malone. Now it's not because he's a bad actor (to be honest, I didn't realise who it was until halfway through), but because Ritchie tried really, really hard to make grime music a part of the film. This isn't a vendetta against grime - it just didn't make a lot of sense when a music video was suddenly cut into the middle of a film, and made even less sense when the plot tried to justify why these street thugs started rapping on camera. It's only a minor plot point, but was jarring enough to take me out of the reality for a second, which really does nobody any favours.The Gentlemen delivers on what it promises. Guns, drugs, thugs, plenty of swearing and a touch of deceit to keep the more observant viewers guessing. Ritchie should stick to what he's good at - this is proof enough that he has a popular niche, and there's still something left in the tank.",

It starts with the structure which is unreliable narrator Fletcher telling the story to Raymond (who should already know most of it anyways). Hunnam is playing an unemotional henchman. Otherwise, he should be the perfect rooting interest. There is no reason for Fletcher to recount the whole story other than a movie reason. Raymond already knows most of the story making the film a waiting game for his character. It saps the tension out of the twists and turns.

            "content": "Michael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), an American expatriate, tries to sell off his highly profitable marijuana empire in London to American billionaire Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong). Things are complicated by Dry Eye (Henry Golding), a Chinese underboss who wants to take the weed business for himself and Fletcher (Hugh Grant), a private investigator who claims to have dirt on Pearson. The rivalry triggers plots, schemes, bribery, and blackmail from all sides in an attempt to steal Pearson's domain out from under him.After the release of Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction in the mid-nineties spawned a wave of crime comedies featuring an ensemble cast, snappy dialogue, and non-linear plot structure, such as Two Days In The Valley, The Boondock Saints, and Killing Zoe. Guy Ritchie was the most successful filmmaker to rise out of that wave with his first film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and quickly followed by its higher budgeted counterpart Snatch.In film school, Lock Stock was on everybody's top ten list and it was hip. The non-linear storytelling broke the mold and the witty dialogue (although realistically no gangster would ever speak in such a manner) felt fresh and entertaining onscreen. The comedy of errors between the bumbling gangsters and how they inadvertently ruin each other's plans was laugh-out-loud funny.Trying to engage with Guy Ritchie's The Gentlemen was a flitting experience. The story keeps moving sideways instead of forward; it zigzags between its numerous gangsters who will spiel and pontificate about the gangster life and explaining the philosophy behind what they're doing as they're about to do it. One can't help to imagine whether if these gangsters would get more things done if they'd just pull the trigger instead of monologuing.Matthew McConaughey, Hugh Grant, Collin Farrell, and Henry Golding all deliver fine performances, trying very hard to add dimension their thin characters and make the stylized dialogue feel believable. The endless switching between characters undermines all the performances. It's hard to tell who you should be rooting for and at times, as if I was going crosseyed, all the characters blend into being the same Guy Ritchie gangster.The unreliable narration device, in the form of a conversation between Hugh Grant and Charlie Hunnam, is meant to add humor and suspense but ends up completely sucking the life out of the entire story because the story is completely told to the audience by two people in a living room. There's no narrative purpose to the unreliable narration because it is not developing the character or presenting their mindset like for Harley Quinn in Birds of Prey or Edward Norton in Fight Club. It just presents an event on what the two narrators are speculating happened and then the film reveals what really happened in a \"just kidding\" type way. A fan edit would drastically improve the narrative just by removing all the unnecessary elements to its portentous structure.Guy Ritchie even goes to add an unnecessary meta-layer to the story. Hugh Grant's private investigator presents the dirt on Matthew McConaughey's gangster as a written screenplay, which allows for his blackmail to sound like a film pitch. This opens up conversations about film stock and editing, which makes the film even more pompous. There's also a The Man From U.N.C.L.E poster hanging in one of the gangster's offices.In the end, The Gentlemen ends up coming off as smug and obnoxious like it knows it is genius and ahead of its audience. The thing is, I have seen this movie before (4 times in fact) so it didn't outsmart me nor was it particularly funny. I sat through it wondering when things will finally take off but the plot never goes anywhere. The story played like Guy Ritchie was playing mad-libs with his usual crime comedy template.Contrary to most of the writers-directors' careers, Guy Ritchie is one of the rare examples of a director who fares better doing higher-budget franchise properties. His reinterpretation of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson as a bickering couple in steampunk London was fresh. Little stylistic touches like his use of slow-motion to show Sherlock Holmes's thinking up a plan right before doing it in real-time were creative. His penchant for high-energy frenetic cinematography enlivened the dance sequences in Aladdin.Possibly with the box office disappointment with King Arthur, perhaps Guy Ritchie felt like he needed to revisit his grassroots by making The Gentlemen.All in all, the Guy Ritchie crime comedy is finished. The well has been dry a decade ago with Rocknrolla. Ritchie should have stopped at its peak as he has said everything he had to say with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. I'd recommend people rewatch them instead.Facebook.com/OCinemaD/",

The worst accent goes to Matthew McConaughey who I assume was going for Little Lord Fauntleroy or Oliver Twist in a grade school drama production. His wife, the cockney mob moll, was way too much of a clich\u00e9. I blame the director for all of these annoyances because it's his film.He was going for stylish and campy, but it was cartoonish and unconvincing. His use of timeline irregularities was also annoying; the whole unreliable narration thing has been over-done to death.I was never convinced of the protagonist was capable of ruling over a pot empire, and how he built it wasn't realistic in the least. If you think about his grand plan for even a second, it makes zero sense.There sure was a lot of blood, blood everywhere. He must have bought fake blood in fifty gallon drums.Not the director's best.",

He has to overcome many obstacles and difficulties in order to retire and relax.I liked this movie very much because it had an amazingly interesting plot combined with some great interpretations made by its cast. The direction which was made by Guy Ritchie was for one more time magnificent and remind me the movie \"Snitch\" and \"RocknRolla\". The interpretations of both Charlie Hunnam who played as Ray and Hugh Grant who played as Fletcher were simply outstanding. Some other interpretations which have to be mentioned were Matthew McConaughey's who played as Michael Pearson, Colin Farrell who played as Coach and Jeremy Strong's who played as Matthew, and they all did a great job. I highly recommedn everyone to watch this movie because even if you are not a fan of Guy Ritchie's movies I am sure that you will enjoy it due to the fact that it has a very interesting plot consisted of some plot twists that you won't and some very good interpretations. Finally, if you are a fan of Guy Ritchie's movies then I don't have anything more to say except to watch it and afterwards I am sure that you will consider it as one more of his masterpieces.",

            "review_title": "The usual Ritchie in terms of both strong and weak aspects",
            "content": "\"The Gentlemen\" is the newest movie by director Guy Ritchie, who is also one of the three writers here and is nowadays still not only known for his movies, but also for the fact that he was once married to Madonna. This film runs for approximately 110 minutes and looking at it in detail, I would say that his approach and the outcome in terms of style and pretty much everything else is the same like it was 20 years ago for him. It's very frequently style over substance. The fact how over the top the story may be is not too important if there are constantly cool quotes, spectacular characters and outrageous events happening. The best example is the kid falling out of the window. Or that there are rails where the Asian guy falls down and that this very second also a train arrives. Or his name of course and the many jokes about this are also a prime example. But it also results in a lot of fun. I just mentioned Aslan falling out of the window already. Now that entire scene was hilarious with Hunnam's character and the kids there and the two strong folks too of course. And also after he falls out of the window when we see Hunnam run after the boys (or one of them), then have a conflict with them, then pull his gun. And so on. Also how one of the two brutes deals with the situation and we see it just like Hunnam's character does. All accompanied by some of the smartest and most hilarious dialogues out there.I think Hunnam was my favorite from the cast here. And that means something because it is a really good cast. He is growing more and more on me. I still wonder if his character is actually a cannibal, if he is eating what he seems to be eating near the end? And if yes, then if he knew what he was eating? Namely a juicy piece of prey meat handed to him from the boss lion to his most precious aide? Anyway, my praise for Hunnam means even more because folks like Grant, Marsan and McConaughey are actors I also like a lot. Not to mention that Farrell, Dockery and a few other experienced and highly successful actors are on board here. I somehow feel that with this cast at his disposal, Ritchie could have come up with something better. But it is really all almost pointless fun from beginning to end. Of course there are also sexual references, but the most \"worrying\" is the great deal of violence here. Also not just that it happens, but how it happens. It is sometimes pretty extreme. Take the meat references towards the end. Or how it starts right away as we see McConaughey's character at a restaurant just having a tea or coffee or so and then somebody comes and shoots him in the head. Well, at least it seemed that way. Reality is different as we find out later on. But it could have happened like this because all we see afterwards for over 60 minutes after this little opening takes place before said opening. Other than that, it's a fairly chronological movie.McConaughey seems like the protagonist early on, the lion as he calls himself, but the longer the film goes, the more it turns into an ensemble performance really and there are long sequences that do not feature him at all, even if at the very end, he is back again as strong as possible and he almost looks like a lion there, too strong maybe even because at some point, it just felt like a film that tried his best to show us the most hopeless situations for McConaughey's character and how he always manages to get out of them. Often through mere luck. It is just really absurd. Hunnam's character arriving on time at the restaurant was still alright, but how the boxer kids open fire and kill the two Russian gangsters in the front seats was just too ridiculous honestly. Or also how Farrell's character kills those at Hunnam's character's house. I must say I struggled a bit with Farrell's role in general, already his very first scene when he shows these boys how he is physically and intellectually superior there. Prime example of the aforementioned style over substance. Oh well. Then again I am not a big fan anymore as I was years ago when it comes to Farrell.The one actor I like more is Hugh Grant (he has steadily risen in my perception and was Oscar-worthy in \"Florence Foster Jenkins\" not too long ago), so I was a bit disappointed that he is basically only used for the framework here and a bit of a blackmail story because honestly I could have done without this part completely. He is not needed to tell the story, even if he has his fun moments too like how he comes from the bathroom when the two gangsters arrive with Aslan's corpse. But as a whole, he could have added a lot more if his character had been written more convincingly. At the end, how he ends up in that box and still has this revelation to share about Aslan's dad and the consequences coming with it and how it all happens at the same time is also really exaggerared. I did not like it too much. At the end, he seems free, but nope not yet, he is again in Hunnam's character' car. When Grant's character gives the script to Miramax (also the actual producer here of course), he implies there could be a sequel to his ideas, which certainly can be understood in a way that this film here could also get a sequel. Also fairly fun how people in his story at the end end up in cars under dangerous circumstances while also he ends up in a car in a situation he desperately wants to get out of. Will he live or die? We also will see in a sequel perhaps. I think this one here was good enough for me to check out a sequel if they ever make one. I hope they use another awesome song for the opening credits there just like they did here (\"Cumberland Gap\"). Had to download immediately when I was home. I hope such a sequel features Hunnam's character prominently then, maybe even more at the center of the story than he was here.Okay, what else can I say about this film. I was really tired at the beginning, so maybe this is why I felt that it needed a while to become a good film. Or I don't know, maybe it never turned into a good film, but just a funny, fairly creative one. The core story is really easy to criticize with how absurd it turns out at times (also the complete absence of police) and I am not one bit surprised that critics apparently did not like the film too much from what I have read. I probably could write another two paragraphs, most likely more, only filled with cool quotes here, but I won't. Instead I say: Go watch the film yourself and I am positive you will smile or even laugh a lot. Also about the absurd comedy. Even when there is talk about a guy being locked in a gigantic freezer, it is somewhat funny. Enough said. Tarantino will perhaps like it too. Let's just hope the guy in the freezer will not have a similar fate like Aslan('s corpse). Oh well, then again I did not like him too much either, the guy in the freezer I mean, the Jew with his crabs that is, perhaps also because of his introduction early on. Later on, he was slightly more interesting, but there it was also basically McConaughey just doing all the work in the scene with him. Oh and Eddie Marsan yes, I have to mention him because I really adore the actor. Now his scene with the pigs and the implications what happened (luckily they spare us the visual side) were just so wrong and yet hilarious. Nice to see Marsan getting to work with some really big stars here. In that scene, or the aftermath, even Farrell's comments were truly hilarious about how they could never unsee what happened there. They should have named the pig Napol\u00e9on though, no idea how they forgot about this reference.Okay, this is all then I suppose. I give the movie a thumbs-up for sure and recommend checking it out. Could have been 10-15 minutes shorter though if they had left out some of the weaker parts or the entire frame story (and given Grant a better role). Even there, when they try to be smart, like with the wire in the shoes, it is never \"Knives Out\" level. Still, it's worth 110 minutes of your time, especially if you like most of the actors as much as I do. What I do have to say though is that in terms of character writing, Ritchie still has to win me over that he can also come up with high-quality female characters. Sure, it is difficult in a world of organized crime, but Dockery definitely is not it here. The young girl at the apartment that they are supposed to bring home is even more interesting although she has like 10% of Dockery's screen time. At least in terms of items Dockery delivers. That tiny golden gun is really cool and also the references to it being just a paperweight. Okay, now that is really all. I think you could say that \"cool\" is the perfect word to describe the movie, even if it certainly is also a bit on the shallow side.",

The characters have no other personality other than the one-dimensional characteristic of \"I'm better than you.\" They are the typical cigar-and-gun-lovers trope. They swear without purpose; they just want to be seen as intimidating without proving much of any point. Don't get me wrong, I love a good classy/gentleman character if done well, just like in the Bond movies for example, but this is NOT it. The characters walk and act like cheap imitations of so-called classy gentlemen but without any complex emotions or truly deep backstories.And because these characters were so cliche and one-dimensional, the story was ruined. Usually, a good story line is propelled due to some intense moral dilemma or some higher purpose, but no. There was none of that, the plot was secondary; the whole purpose of the film was just to show how \"cool\" the characters are.I watched this movie in theatres and it was literally the first film I had to walk out of. I made it maybe 3/4 through the movie and it felt like there was no cathartic reveal or fight or anything, just pure power play. I doubt that the end of the movie would've made me feel any better. I love good movies and usually I go through a whole range of emotions throughout the movie, but I got no emotions during this one. It's a no from me.",

It starts with a killing...or does it and if so, who's been killed, before leaping forward to what's basically a pitch for the film we're watching being made by a very dodgy private investigator, (a never better Hugh Grant), to a well-heeled gangster, (Charlie Hunnam).Part of the fun is the way Ritchie subverts our expectations, not just in the torturous way he tells his tale, but in the casting. I mean, who would have imagined 'Downton Abbey's' Lady Mary, (a superb Michelle Dockery), playing a foul-mouthed Cockney moll or indeed Grant's terrific turn as a blackmailing scumbag. The rest of the cast can be taken as read; for the Ameriican market, Matthew McConaughey as Mr Big, Colin Farrell, (brilliant as 'The Coach'). Eddie Marsan as a sleazy newspaper magnate, 'Succession's Jeremy Strong as one of McConaughey's rivals and Henry Golding, getting better with every picture, as a small-time Asian gangster with big ideas.They are all wonderful, spouting some of the best dialogue of any Guy Ritchie film but then perhaps they had to be since the plot isn't that easy to follow, (everybody seems to be double-crossing everyone else), making this the only Guy Ritchie movie you will almost certainly need to see twice.

The movie is funny, clever, violent and terribly entertaining.Still, it's not without imperfections. There'sa few instances where we could have really benefited from subtitles. It also has a few cheats and conveniences in the plot. Oh, and it's pretty darn racist at times too. There's also a moment that's so meta it popped me out of the movie pretty heavily.Negatives aside, this was still a fun experience. It was a fun ride from start to finish and absolutely worth giving a shot. Can't wait to watch this one again and see if there was anything I missed.",

The film features the typical gangster elements seen in other films of its type, mixed in with some humourous & dark moments too. The dialogue & witty banter heard in the film was good. The story telling kept you locked in from start to finish.While the film is solid, there is a lot of details & plots points going on so prepare yourself when watching as it has many layers to the overall synopsis.Overall a solid crime thriller. 8/10",

Yeah me neither, but it is the thought that came to mind when I was watching this film today. A trailer that was sort of lost on me, today's work directed by Guy Ritchie had me a little undecided how this film would go. Potentially a stuffy, slow, hard edged movie with lots of cursing and torture, I could only imagine what I would get, especially when another fan left in a rant 20 minutes into the film. What was the end result? Robbie K here to give you some insight as he checks out:Movie: The Gentleman (2020)Director:\nGuy Ritchie\nWriters:\nGuy Ritchie (screenplay by), Guy Ritchie (story by)\nStars:\nMatthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Michelle DockeryLIKES:The Humor\nThe Character Usage\nThe Mystery/Politics\nThe Connections\nThe Presentation\nThe Censorship of violence, for the most part\nThe ActingDISLIKES:The Excessive Cursing For Me\nMissing Some Action\nThe Extended Ending\nSome Stereotypical Annoyances\nThe Rapping Video\nSlow At Parts\nSUMMARYWhen it comes to the British writing style, this reviewer always looks to the potential for balanced writing. Sure enough, this is one of the times where the writing is truly representative of a master writer in multiple facets. This tale contains some amazing humor to it, not so much in the form of slapstick, one liner filled form, but a much deeper levels that uses timing, setting, and wit to maximize the laughs. It's dry I'll admit, but the humor goes so well with the plot at hand that it adds rather than distracts from the enriching plot that this film contains. With this supporting component, the movie continues to get better in the way it balances so many things to make an engaging mafia tale. First the character usage, the movie is filled with a lot of stars and they are utilized very well, with so many (including secondary characters) having a purpose and contribute to the film in a way or manner to make their inclusion worthy. While it seems spotty at first the movie's progression begins to start connecting all the players in the game, starting to unravel and help give pieces of the story without ever giving away the big mystery. It's this balance of connections with the mystery that for me was the biggest engaging piece to the movie, that teasing to see how deep the politics run always being that itch you can't scratch. Yet, for a movie about crime lords, you know politics is going to make an appearance and once more they impressed me with the presentation. Again choppy, The Gentleman appealed to me because the politics had heat, tension, but were not so drawn out and convoluted to be boring, something not easily accomplished in this day and age for a movie. Yet if that's not interesting enough, the movie also manages to sneak in a more unique presentation, told through the imagination and sleuth of Hugh Grant's character, who is filling the pieces with his evidence and theories to help piece the story together. The genius for me is, the holes he has acts as the missing pieces for you to try and string together the ideas yourself before the big reveal. You might also be concerned for violence, after all, the crime lords with this much power do not show the nicest attitudes to those that threaten them. Fortunately, the movie manages to censor most of the extreme violence and torture that these movies can be famous for, and this little extra class did not take from the movie, but only added. Finally, all of this is fantastically acted, with each major character executing their role in so many levels I could take another page to describe. Let's just say McConaughey has found a new favorite role for me, finally ditching the super sleazy for a role that is much more complete to show off his talents. Hunnam as well was indeed a fantastic pillar character, filled with a level of emotional complexity that seems to be so monotone, but yet contains layers that unravel. I did not find too many overacted moments and was very thrilled with seeing so many stars shine.Yet, there are still some styles of this movie that did not quite hit me as hard as the others, at least in terms of liking it. First of all the cursing. Old record, I know, and given my own mouth sometimes it's becoming less, but there are a few words used freely in this movie that were a bit excessive. Part of the culture, great, but like in Django overuse of the word soon starts to become lazy and stale for this writer. While I enjoyed much of the toned-down storytelling, I'm always partial to a bit more excitement to help spice up the mob war films. A shoot out here or there could go a long way but the satire and humor in this film sort of dilutes the action that starts forming, before dropping back into the mincing tactics. Anyway, looking at the character profiling, the film is both genius and frustrating for me in its generational portrayal, with the contenders for the crown. At the same time the stereotypical summaries of each generation are little overdramatic and extreme, leading to sort of annoying moments that weren't the worst, but felt a little out of place (this is especially true for Henry Goulding's character). I'll admit there are also some bloated moments in the film, but these are few and far between and as stated, a little swap out with some action could have helped with these moments, again few and far between. Finally, the part that really stuck out for me was the rapping. Kudos for the art behind it, the impressive speed at which they rap, and the dance stunts in the back, but that's about all I'm going to say in terms of appropriate. When the video first appears it sort of does not make sense, but thankfully the writing uses it as a good plot device to help make up for how forced and advertising it seems. Like I said earlier, it's a generational stereotype that was a bit annoying to watching and were probably the most annoying characters of the bunch, despite having some of the coolest moves. Again, thank goodness for the writing making up for them. Sadly, the other thing that was both funny, yet again excessive is the ending, a few fake out and extension that almost feel like last minute tag-ons that may or may not have been needed.The VERDICT:To be honest, I was very surprised with how much I enjoyed this movie and how much the trailers did not ruin the experience for me. British settings, humor, and styles of writing continue to prove successful in balancing a lot of balls and I'm super impressed with how much correlated together in this piece. The drama, the mystery, the presentation, and the politics are all super well represented in this gang war, never getting so caught up in details to be boring, but not slighted to feel robbed of good development. That unique presentation we talked about only further adds some fun edges to it, and works with the gaps to help keep you engrossed. Finally, the actors really bring the characters to life and worthy of several awards with how well they bring these strange characters to some cool levels. Yes, the writing is still a little overdone at times, there are some annoying moments/stereotypes to consider, and a few slow parts that could have been ironed out. However, the balance of this movie and just fun, classy writing really make this one a worthy trip to watch in theater for performances, and a definite check in at home when you get the chance.My scores are:Action/Crime: 8.0 (not as much action)\nMovie Overall: 7.5 - 8.0",

            "content": "After such a long period of repeated missfires and last year's disastrous Aladdin remake, Guy Ritchie has divorced himself from the mouse and has come back in full swing with The Gentlemen, a film harking back to his two previous cult classic gangster films \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" and \"Snatch\". And it's just what you would want if you loved those movies. The acting is pretty good all around and the pacing is as quick as you'd expect, but what really makes this movie is the writing itself. Just like with Snatch and Lock Stock, the dialogue is clever, witty and has a lot more meaning behind it than you may realise, which is another thing I love about Ritchie's films: They actually require you to PAY ATTENTION. So many people just switch a film on and don't think about anything that's happening. Ritchie basically bends those people over and forces them to think about what is happening and what is being said. This is why you find a lot of people who say they found Snatch to be confusing due to all of the plotlines happening at the same time as well as them not paying attention to what is actually being said. Which is a shame because the dialogue in Ritchie's films is insanely funny and brimming with wit. Snatch is probably better in terms of dialogue simply because I can quote every line in the film at this point, but The Gentlemen has a lot of great lines for sure. It isn't all humour of course, but I thought I'd just go over what makes Ritchie's films so good when compared to other things released nowadays.Overall I would HIGHLY recommend The Gentlemen for people who loved Ritchie's previous gangster films as well as those who haven't watched anything he's made before and want a good place to start. It may be hard to get used to, especially with how vulgar it is compared to the rest of the politically correct garbage being dumped out of Hollywood these days, but it's certainly worth paying to see.",

It's clever, it keeps pace, it doesn't stop. And it was more than I expected. Where it succeeds is holding you captive to the wonderment of anticipating every characters' next move on the plot chessboard that unfolds before you.The acting is great; I can't fault anyone in performance or their placement in their roles. Putting this film together...and I am just stubbornly refusing to give it the perfect 10 in my assessment as a 9... but it's just shy of being a modern theatrical masterpiece.If you get bored,, somehow lose it along the way... blame me.

            "content": "Guy Ritchie is back to his best dealing with subjects he is a master of, East London and gangs. This film is full of action, gratuitous violence and comedy. It hits the mark in all that it does.Matthew McConaughey is Pearson, the main man is the local drug business who is looking to move on and retire from the life. His future purchasers are trying to get better deals for themselves and he is having issues with the respectable drug addled daughter of some rich friends. His right-hand man, Raymond (Charlie Hunnam) is there to sort out problems and find solutions. His wife Rosalind (Michelle Dockery) has her own business and her own problems. Coach (Colin Farrell) trains the local youths and tries to keep them on the straight and narrow and when he can't he sorts out their screw ups and Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is a PI hired to do a job and rather enjoying himself doing it.As you would expect with any great Guy Ritchie film, there are twists and turns galore and plenty of laughs along the way. Charlie Hunnam is superb, in fact Sons of Anarchy is the only thing I've seen him better in. He carries a threat about him with a sense of enjoyment in what he does. Colin Farrell, who I have no strong feelings about either way, is fantastic as Coach who is very very dangerous but only when he has to be and is more concerned about his students.This is one of the better films I've seen recently and I will happily put this up there with Lock Stock and hope it is remembered with the same fondness by everyone. Though be warned there is more than a few casual C Bombs dropped! Well done Mr Ritchie, well done! An 18/20 for this action/comedy romp!Forgot to say Hugh Grant has immense fun in his role as Fletcher and it is great to see him do something different. Brilliant!",

He had a cool disposition abot his rise to power though, i would love to watch that movie instead. There is no depth to this character, except a couple of cool speaches. Is Charlie Hunnam, who's basicaly a McConaughey's butler a protagonist? - No! He's main characterestic his unexplained loyalty. Basicaly the two characters are some sort of snobish gangsters look a likes, spending time in some pretensious bar. Martial guys disposition was cool, could also be a good movie. And the biggest flaw is that the whole premise is not believable. Good thing about previous Guy Ritchie movies was the chaos. Characters are being drawn into a mayhem of events. Stupidity and chance make movies funny and give them that sense of reality, because reality is also unpredictable. Gentlemen is all about plans, and characters magicaly forseeing each other actions, so the film fieels like a scenario, it fails in creating an illusion of reality.

One of the best acting ensembles in a movie recently with Mathew McConaughey, Colin Farrell and Hugh Grant (in a never-seen-before performance which is far removed from his romantic comedy roles). I thought his voice was dubbed; it isn't. Michelle Dockery is sensational in her small role. If you've seen Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch then you know what to expect. But instead of fast edits, narrative overlays in slow motion, etc, here you'll find static camera, actors on their marks, quick cuts and fast speaking performances.

Coach (Played by Collin Farrell) was my favorite character in the whole movie, Ray (played by Charlie Hunnam) was amazing, Fletcher (played by Hugh Grant) was also amazing, the charisma of each character is the thing that really saved the long conversations or maybe the whole movie, to be honest, and without it, these conversations would've been boring as hell and the movie was gonna be dead.Really loved the production design that really suited the environment and the characters, also the custom designs were pretty cool and fancy exactly like they should be.Now for Mickey Pearson (Played by Matthew McConaughey ), I wish if we could have seen him more in the movie, felt like he didn't have much of a role or something, he was just the \"BOSS\" that has his guys to do everything for him and to be honest it makes sense he's the guy who built the highly profitable marijuana empire so of course, he's just gonna have his guys do everything for him, they even call him \"BOSS\" the whole movie, but I still wanted to see more of Mickey Pearson or to be specific, I wanted to see more of Matthew McConaughey.Although all the characters in the movie were \"BAD CHARACTERS\", we still really loved them that's a thing that I loved about the movie.\nFelt like there were some characters that weren't even important in the whole movie or they didn't have much impact in the story and one of them is: Dry Eye (Played by Henry Golding), although his acting was okay, his character was a waste of time.The Gentlemen is a very funny and interesting movie, filled with a bit of action that you'll enjoy, really recommend this fun movie.My rating is: 7.5/10",

It just clicks along, with a tension-inducing plot, AMAZING acting, and enough humor to keep me giggling in between bouts of crushing action.I have yet to read a (professional) critic's review that's not all about the supposedly overwhelming racism. To them, I must say, \"please, fellows, LIGHTEN UP!\" I'll get this out of the way: I'm a woman of color. I'm a bleeding heart liberal. There. Everybody feel good? Normally, I get pretty prickly whilst reading a certain kind of IMDB review that's a thinly disguised alt-right whine-fest at having to watch (gasp) women, people of color and \"teh gays\" play roles that used to be exclusively for straight white dudes.In \"The Gentlemen\", there are racial slurs, and one of the Jewish characters and the gay character aren't \"good guys\". But the \"racism\" is presented as tongue-in-cheek, and a reflection of the stupidity and unlikeability of the characters voicing it. I think you have to be pretty humorless, pedantic, and incredibly eager to be offended to snippily mount your high horse and complain about \"The Gentlemen\" being \"horribly\" racist.As far as the performances, my gawd is this a great cast!!! Hunnam and Grant are standouts, but everyone is firing on all cylinders. And per usual in a Ritchie film, the soundtrack is just CRACKING, filled with some 70s deep cuts from Roxy Music and Can, as well as some impeccably chosen obscurist tracks from artists like El Michels Affair's horn-filled cover of Wu Tang's \"Shimmy Shimmy Ya\". The haunting, folksy opening credits song, \"Cumberland Gap\" will be echoing in your head for weeks.If you're capable of getting over yourself, \"The Gentleman\" is a solid choice that stands up to MANY MANY re-watchings.

Fortunately, for us, we seem to be in a Guy Ritchie \"peak\" a this moment.Following up to his surprise strong Directing turn in the live action ALADDIN remake (if you haven't seen this film, the BankofMarquis strongly recommends you do), Ritchie returns to his \"British Gangster\" roots with the violent, funny and original THE GENTLEMEN.Starring Matthew McConaughey as a U.S. born and bred, Cambridge educated hustler who becomes king of the British Marijuana scene who is looking to get out of the business, THE GENTLEMEN tells the tale of the...ahem...gentlemen that are pursuing (both legitimately and illegitimately) his empire.The way that this film is constructed, the most essential casting of this film is that of the central character of Michael Pearson. He is billed as an enigmatic, charismatic, violent and brilliant legend of the British drug trade, so Ritchie needed someone with all these qualities to inhabit that role. Fortunately, with McConaughey, Ritchie finds his man (I'm sure the backstory of this character needed to be tweaked a bit upon this casting to explain why an American is the king of British Weed). McConaughey is at his laconic best in this role, bringing star quality - and star power - that holds the center of this film together well.He is joined by a strong cast that understands the type of film they are in and are game to join in on the (violent) fun. Michelle Dockery (DOWNTON ABBEY), Henry Golding (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS) , Jeremy Strong (THE BIG SHORT) and the always watchable Eddie Marsan (THE WORLD'S END, amongst others) all are strong in the limited moments that their characters are allowed to shine, but with McConaughey and 3 other actors I will speak to in a moment, they are relegated mostly to the background.This is because Hugh Grant (4 WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL), Colin Farrell (PHONE BOOTH) and (surpisingly) Charlie Hunnam IPACIFIC RIM) almost steal the film from McConaughey, Each one of these characters could have easily been the centerpiece of their own film and I would be happy if Ritchie would spin one of these characters off.Credit, of course, for all of this has to go to Ritchie who wrote and directed this film I was pleasantly surprised by the cleverness and inventiveness in storytelling and style as well as the restraint that Ritchie shows in the violence. He uses it (somewhat) sparingly and well, so the violence punctuates the action.All-in-all a fun (though violent) time at the movies.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

The story is fantastic, the dialogue is great, and the film is surprisingly non complicated if you simply pay close attention, but it's genuinely easy to follow. I highly recommend, Guy Ritchie can be a genius. Great acting all round. At points it can feel a bit ridiculous., but it's not meant to be taken seriously sometimes. It's a fun film, and just very original. May offend some, the constant use of the word c#@t made a woman close to me tut throughout. Amazing characters, loved everything about it. How everything unfolds, where it leads to, it's just a cool ride that manages to keep you engrossed. It's got that typical Guy Ritchie style that we're used to at this point. If you like the guys movies, I'm sure you'll be impressed and leave the cinema with a smile. I look forward to going back to see it, I'm sure there's details I probably missed.

Hugh Grant is phenomenal as the shiesty opportunist! This film is a major go!",

The cast is great, Matthew McConaughey is as fun as ever, and Colin Farrell is hilarious as Coach. This is a real old-fashioned film, with wicked and entertaining characters, a film that doesn't burden itself with irrelevant nonsense, but wants to entertain the viewer, and that's the primary task of any film, and that's what many writers and directors often forget. The film is excellently directed, the cinematography is great, the cast is brilliant and it fits perfectly with its roles. A hilarious and interesting film that is definitely worth watching.",

I would love to give Hugh Grant an award after all he was robbed last year in Paddington 2, he was great here, quite a revelation, but the vehicle that contained his brilliance was flawed.",

            "review_title": "The Gentlemen is classy!!!",
            "content": "It's been a long time since Guy Ritchie has made something that's distinctly his own. He's spent the last decade chasing blockbusters, trying to turn himself into a mega-director the studios love to employ, only to receive a few kicks in the teeth (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword) and one lucky break from basically a sure thing (Aladdin remake). Initially making a name for himself with gangster cinema, Ritchie returns to form with \"The Gentlemen,\" which examines criminal conduct and games of intimidation from a community of bosses, lowlifes, and outsiders. Ritchie isn't taking a tremendous creative gamble with the movie, but it feels like a man flushing the gunk out of his system, returning to his favourite genre to find his violent English playfulness again, which he hasn't been near since 2008's \"Rock'n'Rolla.\"\nFletcher (High Grant) is a sleazy reporter for a British tabloid who's in possession of information that will be of use to Raymond (Charlie Hunnam), employed as a right-hand man for Mickey (Matthew McConaughey), who runs a drug empire with his wife, Rosalind (Michelle Dockery). Eager to collect a fortune for his knowledge, Fletcher shares his concern about a deal Mickey is negotiating with Matthew (Jeremy Strong), ready to sell his marijuana business to a fellow American for 400 million dollars. Trouble is, the secret enterprise has been comprised by Dry Eye (Henry Golding), a small-time stooge trying to purchase Mickey's business for a considerably lower amount, while Coach (Colin Farrell) discovers his boxing students have infiltrated one of Mickey's weed lairs to make a rap video. Fletcher has witnessed this mess from afar, attempting to inspire Raymond to buy his silence, but the gangster is not impressed, listening to the reporter weave together fact and fiction as the future of Mickey's holdings falls into flux.\nIn line with Ritchie's \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" and \"Snatch,\" \"The Gentlemen\" brings the helmer back to the basics in terms of underworld storytelling interests. It's a tale of corrupt figures navigating a disruption to their daily business, with Mickey the central figure of crisis here. He's a smooth operator in fancy suits, sucking on a cigar, overseeing a kingdom of marijuana he runs in the English countryside, paying estate owners a fortune to grow weed underground. That alone is an enticing tale, building on the crumbling realities of \"Downton Abbey\" as Mickey provides cash flow to castle owners unable to pay for massive repairs, allowing them to continue projecting power. However, this is a Guy Ritchie movie, and simplicity of threat isn't of interest to the filmmaker, who quickly complicates a dangerous situation with fresh characters and problems, as everyone is coming after Mickey's marijuana factory in one way or another.\n\"The Gentlemen\" uses Fletcher's manipulation as a way into the story, with the reporter requesting a moment with Raymond in the man's luxury apartment, presenting his version (a \"cinematic journey\") of Mickey's woes to collect a fortune for himself. The screenplay delivers a mighty collision of opportunism and limited patience, generating an intellectual fencing match of sorts between Fletcher and Raymond. The rest of \"The Gentlemen\" explores the narrative up to this point, with Fletcher sharing his information about Mickey's holdings and the plans of Matthew, who's not interested in paying an extraordinary sum of money for the weed farms, while Dry Eye goes against gang interests by making a bid of his own. Coach is the bystander pulled into this dangerous orbit, blessed with his own criminal backstory to keep bad elements away from him and his boxers. The stew thickens throughout the picture, finding trust eroding among the players, which results in the occasional chase and burst of violence.\nRitchie doesn't go wild with \"The Gentlemen,\" which is largely a psychological game between arrogant and scheming men who enjoy the thrill of the hunt and possess a huge fondness for the C-word. It's tightly edited and enormously entertaining, watching a handful of decent actors become great during the run time, with Hunnam, Farrell, and McConaughey contributing some of their finest efforts in the picture, focused on remaining in sync with the director's vision for twisty language and turns of plot. Dockery is a joy as well, portraying a \"Cockney Cleopatra,\" while Grant steals the movie, clearly relishing a chance to portray a tabloid sleazebag. They're pawns in Ritchie's big screen chess game, which delivers on betrayals, heated confrontations, and bruising banter. \"The Gentlemen\" is incredibly fun, restoring some faith in Ritchie's abilities to do what he does best, which is to throw a festival of bad choices from rotten characters with iffy survival instincts.",

Hugh Grant seems to have gotten a second wind the last few years - he's great in this; same for Colin Farrell.Only complaints would be that I wish Eddie Marsan and Tom Wu had more screen time; both are fantastic supporting actors and it would have been nice to have seen more of them.Go, see, enjoy.",

It's a throwback to his gangster flicks of yesteryear, but cruder, dumber and more generic than ever. The plot is updated to modern times with smart phones, street gangs and rap, but it's just mindlessly convoluted, deeply unfunny, profane, and seems to go on and on with no end in sight. Hugh Grant's narrator is more caricature than character, and the only decent performances come from Charlie Hunnam and Colin Farrell; literally the only decent things in this.",

Now, twenty years on, you call all of those people that you shared the lock-stock-and-two-smoking-barrels party with and organize another party. Now though, its in somebody's backyard. Its boozy, and maybe even fun. But its not lock-stock-and-two-smoking-barrels. Everybody still looks OK, just larger than you remembered and with money. That person that did that crazy thing that time now sells real estate. That special somebody just had kid #3.

Matthew (Jeremy Strong) is the most likely but not before he does his own digging. He then hires a gang of youth wannabes under the eye of the coach (Farrell) to make a deadly mistake and try to take down Mickey. Then there is the Asian connection with young hotshot Dry Eye keen to also becoming \"the lion\". The narrator of this fine tale is Fletcher (Hugh Grant).

It has a fun concept and it does draw you in quickly, but the way the storytelling works hurts itself. Basically the movie is a journalist explaining everything he knows about a Marijuana dealer to the dealer's right hand man, so it's essentially 2 stories in 1 (The journalist explaining and the main story).Like I said, its a fun concept, but the problem is that they never balance the two storylines well. You get invested in the main storyline and are eager to see what's next and then it suddenly cuts and now we're watching the journalist talking to the right hand man, which ruins the flow and takes you out of the moment entirely.I will say though that it is well paced and to be honest, it was surprisingly unpredictable.It doesn't help either that the characters are dull. Most of them don't have any density that makes me actually care enough about them. There's a scene towards the end where Michael's wife is in danger and I felt no tension because they just don't give the characters enough to make you care. But the main 3 characters are structured nicely, and they matter most.Even though I had a few issues with the story, The Gentlemen is still a very enjoyable movie that has that special charm that most Guy Ritchie films have to keep you watching.",

The way Guy Ritchie creates it's characters is just a class.Matthew McConaghey does pure justice with his character of a drug mafia and his baritone voice does the rest magic. Charlie Hunnam as his right hand man is not like other henchmen who are ready to fire bullets here and there but is a very calm and cleans the mess created because of the business with an elegance. Hugh Grant in the role of a blackmailing private investigator does his job with an ease. Colin Farrell in the role of a boxing coach of some rowdy boys is an endearing. Jeremy Strong and Eddie Marsan with Michelle Dockery were also impresses and makes the movie complete and joy ride.Overall a great comedy movie with the signature direction from Guy Ritchie.

Dare I say it has some gripping moments? In for a penny and in for a pound here. It will get you early and it doesn't have silly or weak moments. I'm sure there's plenty of reviews regarding the cast so all I'll say is everyone nails their parts properly in addition to a story that seems plausible. Yes, it has a device of a reporter character played by Hugh Grant telling the story in order to line his own pockets. Grant is even glib, smarmy, and narcissistic without any of his usual cutesy schtick. Matthew McConaughey continues to impress and Colin Farrell is excellent in every scene. It's a violent, it's politically incorrect, yet it doesn't pander as it all fits in the story being told. The best film in the Ritchie canon and, probably, the best in the genre.

I tend to gravitate more to substance over style and not vice versa. With that said, there are several pretty dam* cool scenes that will excite fans of this style and I undeniably appreciated them.

It's the inherent morality involved in his character. He might be killing people, breaking the law, but he has his principles. And he abides by them. He is charming, assertive, and most of all, he is adamant on smiting those that betrays him, and rewards those that honors his trust.But how he rewards the trust is very subtly displayed in film, if at all. It's never directly stated how much he trusts his henchmen, just the general comradery he displays with them. You also see Ray, his go-to henchman, is pretty well off financially. But you never really see just how intimate he trusts his henchmen. And that... is a Guy Ritchie film. Characters are often quirky, and it's interesting to see how they interact with other quirky characters, but it's a bit difficult to say you actually care about them. Rather than feeling like real people, they are caricatures and the vehicles to see how the plot unfolds, rather than the driver that pushes the plot forward.That is a subtle nuance, and one might argue it's simply a preference. And it is. There's nothing wrong with characters being pushed by the plot, than the other way around, but you do just end up caring less about them. I often don't remember anything about Guy Ritchie films, other than the unique style and my weak spot for having an ensemble cast.As a whole, the Gentlemen is entertaining, but I can see why there's an abundant of reviews here talking about how the critics are wrong and the audience loved it more. If you've seen his previous movies, as a critic, The Gentlemen will feel too similar, rather than a distinct story on its own. The general audience will find this a blast with its slick edits and dark humor.",

One of the most stupid character is the reporter. All appears exaggerated in order to get the lovely happy ending. Yes, the recitation is good enough but cannot save the high stupidity of this movie.

It was really interesting going through how Micky made his empire & where all his farms are hidden amongst the UK countryside, all the set up required & all the necessary people to keep it going, the film portrays this throughout the film.Defiantly give this film a chance if you are not sure, even if you think its just talking, it is NOT.Age - 25\nCinema: Cineworld Milton Keynes 2D (Unlimited Card)\nWatch, Avoid, Consider: 100% Watch.",

This time, guy Ritchie's way of moving the story is not a coincidence but a balancing act between the characters' intelligence and their characters. The American businessman, the British drug dealer, the Chinese American criminal gang chaos fighting, does not waste any potential foist, the characters are numerous but the play sitting mind not chaos, the first half of the smoke, the second half of the crazy reversal, and Hugh grant's film commentary and ridicule, the end is wonderful.",

            "review_title": "The Gentlemen Film Review - Guy Ritchie Directs Every Kind Of Stereotype With Matthew McConaughey The King Of The Jungle And You Play By His Rules",
            "content": "I have really enjoyed watching Guy Ritchie's recent movies including the varied bag of King Arthur, Aladdin and Man From Uncle. No one trick pony here. And his latest The Gentlemen, that he wrote, co-produced and directed was fantastic, even though it included every kind of stereotype. Still funny in our politically correct time! And said stereotypes looked like they were having a blast. Especially Matthew McConaughey's Mickey Pearson. Not your usual stereotype as a Rhodes Scholar from the wrong side of the tracks, but savvy enough to realise how easy it is to sell weed to posh students in their dreaming spires. And so begins his career and advancement up the social ladder to join the gentry himself.Of course in every (crime) business, there are falling outs, and we find the older and now very successful Mickey, taking 5 one day with a pint and a pickled egg. And from behind he gets his brains blown out. A big player in the London Underworld. Someone must really want him dead.Shifting the time frame around enters the entertaining Fletcher, Hugh Grant, and I guess working from his true life tabloid experience, while adding a bit of Michael Caine sauce to it. His Private Investigator Fletcher is working for the Daily Print's Editor Big Dave, ironically played by Eddie Marsan. Mickey slighted him one day and in revenge Fletcher has been employed to dig the dirt on him. And there's a lot of dirt. So now Fletcher brings it to Charlie Hunnam's Ray. Mickey's No 2 and well Fletcher spins quite the story. So entertaining he's even written a screenplay to go along with his investigation. Bush! And he's willing to sell it all to Mickey for \u00a320million. And he loves Ray's patio barbecue. And it is terrific. Although I did wonder at one point what, or who! was being served.And now Guy Ritchie gets creative telling Fletcher's story. You see prior to the pint and pickled egg, Mickey has taken the decision to cash out of his underground drug business, and spend more time with his beloved wife Rosalind. Michelle Dockery having a ball, from Essex and type cast as the future Lady Rosalind.The film barrels along at a terrific rate, with a motley cast of the aforementioned stereotype gangsters, all preening and cock fighting to get their hands on Mickey's business. And Mickey has agreed a \u00a3400 million price tag. Yes it's that good a deal. And keeps the roof over the heads of the Upperclass in their stately homes of Britain. And so audacious. So much so that American Jewish business man Matthew Berger, played by the almost unrecognisable Jeremy Strong, is keen to get high on the marijuana profits himself, and he has the readies. You could say he wants his pound of flesh. But there's competition, or is it collusion, from the Chinese, or some Asian type!, James Bond himself. Henry Golding playing Dry Eye. And he's Ricensed to kill Fletcher suggests, as he continues his tale to the disbelieving Ray. Dry Eye actually wants in on the weed as his Uncle is a heroin drug lord and won't willingly retire. And then there's the black street boys with their Coach the hilarious Colin Farrell. We'll forgive his crime of fashion because he'll do a job or two to paper over his good but dim boys bad deeds. Pretty handy too in the end. In a David Cameron sort of way. But nothing like a David Cameron sort of way I hasten to add!And of course the Russians get a look in with Fletcher's story, having bought up London with their dirty money. But still loving parents sending their kids to our best public schools. (At a discount given they are all Charitable institutions saving tax, with all UK tax payers losing out.) But some of these new residents still have a hotline to their previous roles in the KGB. But here Fletcher may have over-egged the pickled egg, and his screenplay Bush may not be worth much in his hand.Yes Guy Ritchie has it all covered and how he brings it together is a sight to behold. Spinning the twisting story, and then rewinding to play it again with added testosterone, and plenty of guns, not much blood, and unintentional high speed drops. The language is fruity, with f's and c's, but you don't expect to mind your p's and q's in the criminal underworld. And if Guy Ritchie is auditioning for Bond, then that I have to see. How about him directing James Norton as the suave new Bond?Great fun.",

            "review_title": "First Hit: A few scenes were to fun watch, but as a film, it was poorly constructed.",
            "content": "First Hit: A few scenes were to fun watch, but as a film, it was poorly constructed.I've never seen a Guy Ritchie film that I thought was constructed with thoughtfulness and skill. He either attempts to cover too much ground or is more inclined to use pop and dazzle to engage the audience.In this film, he has to use narration throughout to create, set up, and deliver the story. He hides his inability to write a good screenplay by making the narration of his story part of the storyline his characters say to each other.Specifically, watch most of the scenes between a dirt-digger detective and reporter Fletcher (Hugh Grant and Ray (Charlie Hunnam). Ray is the right-hand man and consigliere for Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), the weed lord of England. Because Fletcher is attempting to blackmail Mickey and Ray, he explains the whole story to the theater's audience by reading the screenplay with Ray.This is the main issue with this film. Having to rely on this narration to provide a lot of the movie's context is troubling. However, I will say the way it is done here is better than having an unknown voice over-explanation.The story as I saw it, was that Mickey wants to sell his vast marijuana growing and distribution empire to Matthew (Jeremy Strong). The reason for selling was unclear and unconvincing. Matthew is a wealthy eccentric Englishman who is intrigued with the possibility of buying this empire for $400M. However, it is a lot of money, and to drive the price down, Matthew engages \"Dry Eye\" (Henry Golding and a term used for Asians). Dry Eye makes an offer that Mickey scoffs at, but because the offer to sell to Matthew was supposed to be secret, Mickey is now on guard.Then the story adds complexity because we learn that Matthew and Dry Eye are working some sort of side deal to assist each other in reducing the price, but each plans to screw the other as well.Adding to this is Fletcher, who, through his detective work, documents all the goings-on between all the parties, which led to the script he reads from. His hopes are to sell the screenplay to Mickey and Ray for $20M so that Mickey and Ray will know all the subversive planning that is going on to drive the price down.The most fun part of the film is when we have scenes with Coach (Colin Farrell). His group of boys is caught raising havoc in one of Mickey's underground farms, so he owes Mickey and Ray. The payback to Ray and Mickey are amusing and fun to watch.Confused? One could be, but this convoluted story is kept on track by the narration scenes. This saves the film from being a total disaster and it also makes it a poorly constructed film.Anyway, there are lots of side plots and stories in this movie, including Mickey's wife, Rosalind Pearson (Michelle Dockery). She's supposed to be the most magnificent woman in the world, but it is only in the eyes of the beholder. There is the newspaper owner who hired Fletcher. There is Lord George (Tom Wu), head dragon, heroin distributor who crosses Mickey.The movie has lots of twists that are used for creating interest and complexity, and in some cases, it works, but mostly it doesn't.McConaughey's role in this makes me wonder. At times he selects fantastic parts like in film Dallas Buyer's Club and other times, he chooses roles like this one. He does it well enough, but it's really a role of false, blustery, and cool-man behavior. Hunnam is outstanding as Ray, Mickey's right-hand man. Grant is oddly compelling as a bad guy. I've not seen him recently, and seeing him here was fun. Farrell is brilliant as the Coach of a group of guys and honest to his word. Actually, I liked his character and role the best of all. Dockery is okay as Mickey's wife and auto builder entrepreneur. Strong is mediocre as the wealthy and odd Englishman who wants to buy Mickey's empire. Golding is formidable as Dry Eye, a youngish Asian who wants to make his mark. Wu was perfect as the wry old heroin distributor. Ritchie wrote and directed this film, and as I've indicated, Guy has little to offer in the realm of filmmaking and his background in music videos is where his talent may lay.Overall: Although entertaining at times, being so convoluted the required narration means the story and film needs additional work.",

And no, it doesn't include Sting, Alan Ford, Jason Statham, or Vinnie Jones in its cast (I kinda wish it did). \"Gentlemen\" is about a once poverty-stricken American who sells off his marijuana enterprise only to get a bunch of criminal blokes who want to steal it from him profit free.Released in London via December of last year and featuring a persona named Dry Eye (that's so Ritchie), \"Gentlemen\" has director Guy Ritchie in held back, gangster reserved mode. It's not as violent as I thought it would be nor is it as fresh (or nasty). Yup, \"Gentlemen\" is a bona fide, Ritchie retread. Too bad it lacks the snap, crackle, and pop of his earlier stuff (Snatch, Sherlock Holmes, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels).Starring the likes of Matthew McConaughey, Colin Farrell, and Hugh Grant (who are all quite good), The Gentlemen has plenty of jump cuts, actors with thick British accents, spit-fire dialogue, numerous flashbacks, a sloppy narrative, and plenty of good old Ritchie speak (\"lovely\", \"double bubble\", \"bullocks\", \"on the tele\"). \"Gentlemen\" also contains too many characters that fade in and out and shoot-'em-up scenes that build dramatic momentum only to come to a screeching halt.For me, Guy Ritchie has enough cinematic trickery up his sleeve and enough spent energy for five filmmakers. He's like the United Kingdom's version of Quentin Tarantino and/or Marty Scorsese. Pity that he's not much a storyteller because The Gentlemen is a little ponderous, a little shilly-shally, and all over the map. When the end credits for \"Gentlemen\" come up you hear the song \"That's Entertainment\" by The Jam. That's funny because the word entertainment and the bulk of The Gentlemen don't quite gel. Rating: 2 and a half stars for well, the empty style points and the lush UK interiors.",

But I will say that, despite overusing the c bomb in the script and a highly unpleasant projectile vomiting scene, what I enjoyed the most was the back and forth between Hugh Grant and Charlie Hunnam, who are the real stars of this film. The dialogue is genius, punctuated by some genuinely funny moments. It's nice to see Michelle Dockery transcend Downton Abbey and Matthew McConaughey gets it done.

When I saw the trailer for this movie I actually got excited, because though I think Ritchie's PG-13 blockbusters are fine, he really shines when he's working with incredibly foul-mouthed, violent and eccentric gangsters. I hoped this film would be a triumphant return to form.While \"The Gentlemen\" is certainly a return to form, but it's not triumphant; it's pretty average.",

His character is perhaps one of the most complex yet fascinating characters I've seen on celluloid in recent times. And Matthew McConaughey has done himself a favour be being in this film.

We've seen these drug dealing movies all too frequently, when honor among thieves is thrown out the window. And Ritchie makes the illicit underground drug industry much more dark with numerous murders that have little consequences to the participants--other than getting shot themselves.All in all, a forgettable film that is ok in its initial viewing, but unsustainable in the memory once a week passes.",

This crime flick is just cool to watch, cool actors, cool action, cool clothes, and good ol'fashioned violence. I probably heard more C bombs in that movie than I've heard in a year... \ud83c\udf7f",

            "content": "There's lots of good stuff about The Gentlemen. The story is fun, engaging and clever. There are a few telegraphed twists and turns, but quite a few blindsided me. Its a good twisty turny plot, and the non-linear storytelling and the way it is told through narration is very clever in adding to this intrigue and mystery. Ritchie's direction is excellent, telling the story in a pretty inventive way in parts with good pacing.Like any Guy Ritchie gangster film, we are treated to an eclectic character list, some of whom are more developed than others. This is one of my criticisms of the film. Far too many of the characters were one dimensional, when they could have been great! Ritchie had the skeleton of some great characters, but failed to flesh enough of them out for my liking.I think McConaughey was a standout, both in terms of character and performance. The jury is still out on Hugh Grant, I haven't decided if it was a cringey or brilliant performance... Other than these two, I found the other characters uninspiring and cliched, the sorts of characters I've seen in plenty of other gangster films. It didn't help that the accents kept coming and going, and this inconsistency was pretty much across the board.I also thought that the dialogue was as rough as anything at times. It was like somebody was parodying a Guy Ritchie film, which is hard as his films already feel like a parody to start off with. I got past this as the film went on and I got more immersed, but at the start it was quite jarring.If you like gangster films and Guy Ritchie, I see no reason why you wouldn't really enjoy this.",

            "review_title": "The Gentlemen might be Guy Ritchie's best film to date!",
            "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I've always been a fan of Guy Ritchie's style. While I do admit that he tends to overuse his own techniques (like he does in this movie), he always manages to bring something unique to his projects. He delivered a pretty good live-action remake of Aladdin while offering his own take (Jasmine has more compelling motivations). I surprisingly enjoyed King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword, but the ending is disappointing. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and the Sherlock Holmes films are entertaining and fun, to say the least. So, yes, I was sort of excited to watch The Gentlemen.With such a stellar cast, how can someone not be interested in an old-fashioned crime-thriller? First of all, I want to get this out right away: it's a movie that anyone can enjoy, sure, but for people who know how films usually work, Ritchie applies a storytelling method that's going to make every \"filmmaking nerd\" lose their minds. Hugh Grant (Fletcher) is mostly the narrator of the entire story, and he's basically interpreting a \"version\" of Guy Ritchie telling the story of his own \"flick\".This means Fletcher goes on and on about film specs like aspect ratios and film gauges but also helping the audience understand what's happening, by announcing if the story is near its climax or if \"the plot thickens\". It's a captivating and funny way of using exposition without it being lazy or forced. Grant also makes sure to ask the questions the audience should be asking. This way, even people who don't like to think when they go to the cinema (yes, they exist) will be able to follow the mystery unraveling.Obviously, the unbelievable cast makes this movie so much fun. Matthew McConaughey is a masterful actor when it comes to carrying long dialogues. Everything he says is always engaging, either by the way he says it, his expressions, or the physical intensity he puts into his own words. Charlie Hunnam (Ray) probably delivers his most amusing performance to date. Ray is definitely going to be a fan-favorite character, and his interactions with Fletcher (with who he spends most of the runtime) are hilarious.Henry Golding (Dry Eye), Michelle Dockery (Rosalind Pearson), and Jeremy Strong (Matthew) all give excellent performances, but Colin Farrell is the best of this group of characters as Coach. His scenes are some of the funniest sequences of the entire year so far. From his accent to the action he eventually gets into, he's one of those characters who will leave everyone wanting more. As for the story, it's undoubtedly one of the most complex screenplays I've seen in a while. Comparing with Knives Out, the narrative structure ends up being a bit similar.Both possess tons of twists and turns that will make everyone scratch their heads for quite some time. Both show different events of the story, featuring a specific character at a particular time in a distinct manner (flashback, flashforward, simple exposition). However, The Gentlemen abuses from its own trick a bit too much, especially during the first half. Something entertaining can quickly turn into something pretty annoying if the storytelling isn't well-balanced. Can't have too much of anything, right?This is my overall issue with the film. Guy Ritchie brings something cool and fresh to escape heavy exposition, but it's still a lot of information to transmit, and it doesn't always work smoothly. Some subplots didn't need to go so deep, which takes time away from more emotionally investing storylines. Nevertheless, in the end, Ritchie stitches every story together seamlessly to create a very well-written flick. With so many intricate layers, it's extremely difficult to bring it all together to make a cohesive finale, but Ritchie does it superbly.All in all, The Gentlemen is another hit for Guy Ritchie, and it might even be his best movie yet. With one of the most complex screenplays in a while, the phenomenal cast elevates this crime-thriller into one of the best films of 2020, so far. Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant, and Colin Farrell stand out, but every actor delivers excellent performances. Extremely funny and captivating storytelling through Grant's narration, which ironic or not, it's both the best and worst component of the movie. When used in excess, it can be a bit bothersome and lengthy, but for most of the runtime, this alternative to substantial exposition works brilliantly. Interesting characters, intriguing mystery, and hilarious bits of comedy make this feature very entertaining. Technically, great editing keeps a well-paced flow, but it's Ritchie's layered narrative that steals the show.Rating: B+",

            "review_title": "Best Guy Ritchie fim in the last 20 years",
            "content": "This is a true return to form. The thing that made Ritchie famous was making highly stylized underground crime thrillers that are really funny with quirky characters. He is not copying his movies from 20 years ago, but he does what he did before with more mature version of it. It has all the visual style, the quick cuts, all of that fun stuff that we liked before but it's not the same version of it. He has updated his bag of tricks. The nature of the storytelling is differtent. Even the age of the lead character is a man that's about Ritchie's age right now. That makes for a nice refreshing return to the thing that he did before without feeling like he's trying to force all of it.The cast here is amazing. With each of these actors Ritchie gives them a fun and odd role that just makes for an ensemble characters that you like watching. It just makes for a lot of quotable lines and great memorable scenes. The standouts her would be (though it was very hard to choose) Hugh Grant. Here we get him doing something pretty different from his usual thing, but it still has all that charm and charisma. Another standout is Charlie Hunman. I haven't seen a ton of his stuff, but this is my personal favorite of his roles so far.The movie builds momentum as it goes along. As you discover how the pieces are fitting together and what's actually happening, you get more and more investested in wanting to see how it's all going to pay off. All the stuff that it sets up absolutely leads to big moments of payoff.It's good for a movie to build momentum as it goeas along. It's good for a movie to end on a high note. But I felt like this one had such a build of momentum and intrigue that the beginning felt like it kind of meandered a little bit.The first 30-40 minutes of the film drags a good bit and is by far the most confusing part of the film. It's told using this framing device involving the dialogue scenes between Grant and Hunnam. Because of this it's so disjointed in the way that it's told in trying to be stylized at times and you don't fully understand who the Hugh Grant character is and what their relationship is because the characters haven't fully been introduced yet. I wasn't quite aure exactly what was going on so it took some time for me to get fully invested in the film. Once it gotten to a certain where you understood the characters and what is going on I was invested. But it took longer than it should have to get to that point.There's also a couple of reveals in the finale that I just thought were so obvious that I'm not even sure if they wew supposed to be presented as reveals.Overall this was a solid return to form for Guy Ritchie showing that he can still write great characters and story.8/10 If you're a Guy Ritchie fan go see this movie.",

Michelle Dockery managed to steal every scene she was in. Can't help but wonder what Lady Mary Crawley from Downton would've thought!

You take away even one beat and it messes up the whole tune, you picking up what I'm laying down? I am so happy seeing this film sit at a positive 7.8 rating in late February 2023. It's such a buildup; old gangster ideology with new gangster philosophies.Example: Back in my old school play days, a gangster would say stuff like: A human soul is like an apple with some bruises, baby. And sometimes, you have to trim off the bruises to see what's crisp and delicious. Always look at your enemies this way. Because one day, your enemies just might be your best cohorts in a larger business.Now, I realize being a 46-year-old Valentine, this may seem old and dusty. But I can assure you, these are good terms to live by, plus a bit of Good Book reading, you dig? In common speak: Michael Pearson obeyed this old ideology with Lord George. I respect that.I swear sometimes that Ritchie can read minds, but you really have to give up some credit to Ivan Atkinson & Marn Davies here. What a story! It just glides across the screen like Superman slowing down the planet rotation. Brilliant, actually. I don't think we give enough credit to the TEAM of writers sometimes; you know?I hope everyone enjoyed this flick as much as I did. I'd love to be a part of a Guy Ritchie flick, even if I was just the coffee boy. But I've got so many stories that could perhaps be ballpein through some Hollyweird metal.You probably have already heard about a remaining Stones & Beatles tour by now, right? Well, just imagine if Ritchie worked on a film with Tarantino & Kevin Smith. Or if all these cats worked with Ruben Fleischer on Zombieland 3. We'd see a crack in the universe, but it would be one string theory ride with an amazing soundtrack.I know I'm a weird cat, but nobody pays me to be and that's the beauty of it all, isn't it?Call each other...please. Now, \"That's Entertainment!\"",

I felt like it all ended then they added 10 minutes on, which I just didn't see the point in it.On the whole though it didn't take anything away from it being an enjoyable watch. It's not as good as his classic films don't get me wrong. I don't think anything will be really. Films like Snatch etc are so good it just can't be beaten. But overall I enjoyed this.

His ability to make all characters have the depth of a main character is matched by few others.\nIn The Gentleman the focus in more on intellect and less on raw violence (though present). The plot Is direct and incisive, keeping you alert without overwhelming you with too much information to follow. An easy mistake to do in these plot twist based movies, but that The Gentlemen tiptoes around with mastery.\nThat being said, the story feels straight out of the Guy Ritchie turn lever machine. While it has its unique twists and turns, they feel reused, and for those of us that have seen his previous movies, the omnipresent sense of \"dej\u00c3\u00a1 vu\" is there detracting from what is otherwise a well constructed plot.\nFor me to rate Snatch as his masterpiece, I have to rate this one at an 8, pulling on 7 for those that are not fans of the style.",

The whole thing is unrealistic in the extreme. The weakest part is Matthew, played by Jeremy Strong. I'm not sure if he's just an appalling actor, if his dialogue in this was particularly silly, or a combination of both, but it was distractingly, embarrassingly awful.I've happily enjoyed the highly stylised, slick, funny and brutal work of Guy Ritchie in the past, but this film is not the best.",

The last forty minutes of the movie is completely dedicated to reveal after reveal that just blows your mind further and further adding to the confusion but you simply can't not enjoy. The action is pretty good, it's very grounded which definitely suits the movie. There is also a lot of straight dialogue and drawn out scenes which creates for intensity but can also become quite boring in a sense...a lot of business talk.

I believe Snatch is still his masterpiece and his best film along with Lock stock. This comes a close 3rd behind these 2. It's you're typical 1 liner cockney gangster comedy with superb witty dialogue in true Ritchie fashion. If are you not British, notably a Londoner, you will find it hard to understand certain phrases and the terminology, but don't let it put you off. Shove the sub titles on if you find it a little difficult to follow. That being said, the usual interweaved story that climaxes to a superb conclusion like every other similar Ritchie film is apparent and a brilliant cast is on the menu throughout. Hugh Grant the pick of the lot, playing a sleaze ball called Fletcher, who seems to have dirt on everyone ;) I won't spoil the story of the film, but I will certainly be recommending anyone to watch this fantastic British crime comedy, that's worth the 2 hours of your life.

After his fun role in Paddington I think he plays villains better than the good guy!\nAnd watching Lady Mary Crawley playing an Essex gangsters strong independent partner was just incredible. I wish she had much more screen time as well.And Colin Farrells character is incredibly good fun too - really enjoyed every moment he was on screen.In contrast Charlie Hunnam's character and acting was pretty dull and flat.If you enjoy an gangster movie with some humour then watch this- time well spent!",

I also really appreciate that the movie doesn't rely on action and explosions to be interesting like so many films in this genre often do. There is actually a lot of dialogue and character building. But when the movie does have action they do it very well.My biggest compliant of the movie is the first act.

There is A LOT going on, with the typical Ritchie multiple sub-plots, and it is easy to miss important elements of plot development. In particular, the performances of Colin Farrell and Charlie Hunnam are quite engaging. Matthew McConaughey IS the protagonist, although he plays the role in a somewhat atypical (for him, and for a Guy Ritchie character), very low key manner. But, I found myself liking the character more and more as the film progressed.This is NOT Snatch, which is hilarious, and full of 'BIG personality' characters. The Gentlemen is more subtle, the characters more intricate and calculating. But, it is very enjoyable, in a different way than Snatch, or LS&TSB. It is well worth watching, several times, in fact.",

Rom-com king Hugh grant disappeared in this role of cunning, hilarious, long monologues just nailed it. Charlie hunnam has given his best performance of his career. Colin farrell with his charismatic and hilarious performance he changed the mood of the film into another level.I really liked the movie, if you're a person who is going to offended easily just skip this movie. It has a lot of profanity, a couple of racists jokes. If you like fight club, snitch just go for it you will enjoy.Don't know why critics didn't like it and please IGN stop making movie reviews just stick with game reviews.(Thanks for reading)",

The dialog is delivered tough and hard-line until the recipient has had enough and takes charge of the situation. Hugh Grant (Fletcher) has observed this bunch of outlaws from afar, then with that knowledge puts it in script form and confronts them to extort many multi millions to enrich himself. Ritchie is a filmmaker so the script form figures as does the many references to movie pop culture seeps into the dialog. It dazzles the brain to keep up with the mayhem while delivering a million British style one-liners to make you smile and giggle. Its a lot of fun but a bit confusing so I'm giving it 7 out 10.",

The film sometimes lacks originality with some of its plot and joke ingredients, however fruity writing and timing helps deliver a nice smooth overtone. Charlie's Hunnam should note that Sons of Anarchy was his rise to fame, because he can play a gangster so bloody well. McConaughey held the incredible cast together, and Farrell was a nice sprinkle over the top. Unfortunately the flawless ensemble did expose Henry Golding as the weaker gentlemen, and for the time-being he may want to stick to rom-coms, but only time will tell.

I liked that film but am selective about Ritchie's filmography. The Gentlemen boasts an incredible cast of suave gentlemen who know to smoke and drink in style. Its a loud and abrasive effort which is at times hard to follow but fans of Ritchie's British gangster films will eat this one up for sure.\nThe film is about a man with a cannabis empire and the people around him that want to attain it. The men get into odds with one another and things get violent. A lot of the film is told in an unorthodox way (mostly through a conversation between Charlie Hunnam and Hugh Grant). The film stars a multitude of stars who include Grant, Hunnam, Matthew McConaughey, Jeremy Strong, Henry Golding, Michelle Dockery, and Colin Farrell.\nThe performances are what make the film for me. Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell particularly are absolutely brilliant and memorable characters. The dark and often times offensive humor works very well for the most part. There's many words thrown out there and racial insults so be ready for that. My main issue with the film was the manner in which the plot was told. For me, no matter how much I attempted to follow it was easy to get lost in thee intricacies of what went on in the story.\nI think on a re-watch I would be able to appreciate this film more once I try to work out all of what goes on. I think if you liked Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels then you will find enjoyment out of The Gentlemen as it is in the same neighborhood. I appreciated the style and suaveness of the actors involved in the film but struggled to feel the impact that I hoped it would offer.\n6.5/10",

And yes, there are moments where \"style over substance\" takes over and it all seems a bit excessive.\nBut if you've enjoyed watching a Guy Ritchie movie before, these things won't surprise you and chances are you will certainly enjoy his latest work. The writing isn't quite as brilliantly snappy as some of his earlier films, and since the film does bear a lot of resemblance to Snatch in a lot of ways it's easy to draw that comparison. But in a landscape where Hollywood is pumping out mindless, unoriginal garbage at an unprecedented rate, I was just pleased that people are still making movies like these for me to enjoy.\nThe acting is good. You can clearly tell McConaughey, Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell had a lot of fun with their roles, which sets a nice tone for the entire film, off-setting some of the more brutal aspects of the world of crime it takes places in.\nThere's plenty of laughs, double/triple-crosses, British gangsters being British gangsters. It's the complete Guy Richie package I've come to known and enjoy over the years.\nI would definitely recommend this one to any fan of the genre, as well as to those who aren't.",

            "review_title": "Watching an all-star cast having tons of fun acting",
            "content": "This flick is so much fun that the all-star A-list cast would probably take half pay to be part of it (more about them later). If you were charmed by director/writer Guy Ritchie's \"Lock, stock and two smoking barrels\" two decades ago, you have a right for some expectations with \"The gentlemen\". These expectations are generally met. But first, the players in the story.\nAt the pinnacle is kingpin middle-aged Mickey (Matthew McConaughey), an American who has made it on dealing in weed (and priding himself in not succumbing to more harmful substances). Together with his loyal, capable right-hand man Ray (Charlie Hunnam) and loving wife Rosalind (Michelle Dockery) who is every bit his equal (I suppose I can characterize her as \"queenpin\"), he is quite ready to embrace and enjoy a quieter life.\nVarious power groups covet his business. Sly as a snake, sneakily scheming is Matthew \"The Jew\" (Jeremy Strong). Openly aggressive is Chinese underworld rising-star Dry Eye (Henry Golding) who is at the same time deep in an internal power struggle to get rid of the old guard. Perching at the fringe, with dubious allegiance, ever ready to pounce is \"Coach\" (Collin Farrell), is flamboyance Irish owner of a shady boxing club developing a gang of the fearless gang of the z-generation (or whatever you want to call it). Always lurking in the background with a camera is, the cunningest of them all, one Fletcher (Hugh Grant), prepared to exploit the situation in whatever way he can devise.\nOf the plot, subplots, deceptions, betrayals, insult-hurling, chases, guns, knives, poison etc etc I'll say no more. One interesting observation I like to make though. \"Establishing scenes\" take on a new meaning here. The movie opens with Fletcher going to Ray's house trying to make a pitch. To do that, he actually uses a film projector he has brought along to show Ray scenes of various backgrounds and situations. This dialogue evolves into the backbone anchoring the entire movie from beginning to end, as Fletcher shows scene after scene (which evolve from reels to notebook screens) purportedly useful to Ray's boss Mickey for various reasons. Who will come out on top is for you to discover. Now to the cast.\nFans of the top-notch the \"True Detective\" series may note that this movie features two leads from two generations (seasons, that is). Oscar winner McConaughey (season 1) who has portrayed a large variety of characters is absolutely at ease with the seen-it-all, hard-as-nail kingpin. Equally versatile Farrell (season 2), starting with his charismatic, late entry, is quite intriguing as the boxing expert who vehemently declares that he is not a criminal, but then plays along with the rest of them, and the best of them (thanks, Dolly Levi). Having the most fun must be Dockery and Golding, both letting their hairs down, so to speak, after their respective genteel role for which they are well known. Dockery, in particular, must be having a whale of a time with every alternate line utterance of the F word! Hunnam, totally underrated in today's cinematic world, has a mesmerizing role here, totally minimalist and soft-spoken, until he is not. Awesome! The gold, however, must go to Grant, in his \"intellectual reconnaissance\" role, who captures your imagination with every word and every nuance.\nA sample of the lively dialogue throughout the movie:\nWhen someone is asked if murdered the victim by pushing him off the roof, his reply: \"It was the gravity that killed him\"\n\"I'll be gone as darkness in dawn\" for a pinch of poetic touch.\nMickey asks for a pound of flesh from Matthew \"The Jew\", for a little Shakespearean reference.",

Well, cast is composed by great names such as Matthew McConaughey, Colin Farrell and Hugh Grant.The strongest point of the entire movie is for sure the storytelling. The Gentlemen will uncover little by little the criminal empire built by Michael, all plots made by rivals to take over his business and there will be many unexpected plot twists. I am happy that still in 2020 there are directors that can genuinely surprise me. Transitions between different events are nicely done and help to create a cohesive and continuous story. Movie never lose his pace: everything has the correct timing, never felt bored once.It is not the best movie of Ritchie, but is very solid and for sure worth a watch.",

The screenplay was brilliantly written, with its witty dialogues ( mostly owing to Hugh Grant's extraordinary performance) and plot twists deserving the highest praise. Subjectively-speaking, the film's suspenseful atmosphere felt like that of Knives Out (2019), although The Gentlemen is more pacey and lighthearted.However, its lack of well-choreographed fight scenes, while not a major issue, can leave a feeling of incompleteness.

I get that he wanted to return to form without making yet another version of Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (both of which I liked, especially the former), but I'm quite not sure whether most of the choices he made here in order to render the film a refreshing feel worked together. Regardless, The Gentlemen is a good fun with enough clever touches to satisfy Ritchie's fans.(6.5/10)",

The film for the most part is acted very very well, with Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, and Collin Farrel all deserving some major recognition for their roles. The only performance I had a problem with was that of Hugh Grant's, who I felt was a bit over-the-top in the opposite way which Richie was trying to convey in the film, not to mention he is pretty damn annoying. Nevertheless, this fact, and the fact that the film does take a little while to get its own engines running, are the film's biggest flaws. The film can be very funny when it needs to be, and increasingly entertaining as the film and the world surrounding the characters we are falling begins to unravel. Guy Ritchie is able to balance all these tones fairly well, and it is this, and the fact that the film keeps its head after pulling so many twists, that I remain utterly impressed with it after my viewing. In the end, The Gentlemen is not Richie's best, but it is certainly something to be proud of, and is certainly worth a watch (or two) if you get the chance.\nMy Rating: 8.75/10",

And please don't bring up Aladdin that just had Guy Ritchie flavor, but was very much Disney's movie.) I actually didn't realize that The Gentlemen was a Guy Ritchie film until the opening credits and the movie started rolling. Because once the movie starts you know it's a Guy Ritchie movie. No doubts.At first I was a bit put off. Jumpy, jarring, and then click. The story gets it's footing.The main reason I picked up The Gentlemen was the cast. With some of my all time favorite actors and (sadly) only one favorite actress. (It's very female lacking overall.) Everyone was amazing and I kept thinking \"Oh, well *insert name* just stole the show! Oh, wait now they stole the show!\" I came for Colin Farrell, Hugh Grant, and Charlie Hunnam. And wow, were they amazing!! Especially since the entire cast was, well, amazing! I did not know that the fabulous Michelle Dockery would be in this and she killed it! I feel ashamed of all the movies I've seen her in that just WASTED her skills. I want her to be in more fierce roles like this! Michelle Dockery is a true talent and I hate to see her skilled wasted. I wanted more of her character and loved every moment she was on screen!Once the movie gets going and the viewer \"clicks\" with it, the story is rather brilliant. I love all the tie ins from start to finish and the pay offs. Not to mention the themes. I don't want to give anything away. There's plenty of mystery, suspense, and dark humor that I just love!! Shocking deaths and viewers can definitely feel like every character's life is on the line.One of my favorite movies from 2019 and I wish there was more buzz around it! Not to mention for Hugh, Colin, Hunnam, and Michelle Dockery. Of course the \"star\" Matthew McConaughey (at least the face of the movie) was stellar as usual. I also think this shows another diverse side of Henry Golding who is really curating a solid portfolio of characters and skills. The script also shows it's all about the ideas and writing behind it. Making The Gentlemen a heady rush of brilliant writing, cinematography, and acting.",

The were a few mild chuckles but nothing uproariously funny for a black comedy. Eventually I just got bored and if I hadn't paid to rent it online I would have turned it off.

I liked Colin and the supporting cast did a great job, and I really like British Gangster flicks, with or without comedy. I think the real issue here for me was that the script, was not enough. Not enough flavour, not enough spice, not enough juice, not enough to say great film, but enough to say formulaic.",

Stunning as a nasty gangster's moll and as poisonous as a python ?Unfortunately it doesn't quite have the ridiculous humour of Snatch.

The Gentlemen is Guy Ritchie's The Irishman, so don't go into this steeped in mortality, anti-morality tale expecting Lock, Stock, RocknRolla, or especially Snatch because you will be disappointed. Admittedly, I went into this film anticipating a giddily in-your-face wild ride and initially did not know how to process what ended up being a surprisingly refined and mature bit of nastiness. However, I soon understood that even Guy Ritchie must grow old with the rest of us, which is something that he clearly understands as well. At face value, The Gentlemen appears devoid of sentimentality, but upon closer examination, one could argue that crime films don't get more sentimental. Honest either. It seems Ritchie, much like other seasoned auteurs, has reached that magical point in his career where he no longer caters to audiences, who are calling the film \"boring,\" or critics, who are attacking the film for being \"offensive.\" I would argue that The Gentlemen is neither, but rather the cinematic equivalent to a man of a certain age. It moves at its own pace, no matter how painstaking, voices its own opinion, no matter how unpopular, and flaunts its own style, no matter how pass\u00c3\u00a9. While not without its flaws, specifically one or two moments of unnecessary convolution, The Gentlemen starts 2020 off strong and potentially marks the start of a bold new era for Guy Ritchie. Sure, it's sexist, racist, violent, dated, mean-spirited, and countless other shades of deplorable, but it is also genuine. It proves that a punch to the gut can come from the heart, and I find that endearingly charming, like an old dog peeing on the carpet. Truly, never has such an inappropriate film felt so appropriate. Oh and what a soundtrack! B",

So, smart American has a marijuana empire and it's actually located underground, beneath various royal estates. And no one in government even knows about them or suspects them (yeah). After making his money, he wants to get out of the business. How does one do that? The prospective buyer is a stupid, American, billionaire Jew, with all of the usual anti-Semitic stereotypes, even including that well worn-out line, \"Business is business.\" It wasn't parody; it was totally uncalled for and grossly insensitive. I guess Jews are the only ethnic, racial or religious group left that is still okay to malign. Along the way, the main character manages to seems to antagonize every bad guy on the planet, one way or another, and with every attempt to kill him, his buddies just happen to be there to save the day, over and over. Perhaps this movie was an attempt at nouveau film noir. Perhaps it was supposed to be black comedy. In the end it's the kind of pointless movie you feel like showering after watching.",

            "content": "Guy Richie has been a director that hasn't always blown me away in the past. I've been amused by his outings with Sherlock Holmes and quite enjoyed The Man from U.N.C.L.E., but I wasn't even all that impressed by his fan favourites, like Snatch. For myself, I see that's he's now on a nice little streak. I really enjoyed his live-action remake of Aladdin and I think The Gentlemen may be my favourite film he has ever done. Although it does get a little self-indulgent at times, here's why I believe The Gentlemen may impress you, even though you may need to have an acquired taste for it.The Gentlemen tells the story of Michael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a man who wishes to sell off his Marijuana empire in order to escape from the crimes he has committed. This leads to a lot of blackmailing and mistakes, which then leads to death and chaos. However, at its core, this film is about Fletcher (Hugh Grant), a man who is trying to make this story into a feature film. This element was probably my favourite portion, as it tied current events into past events, which made for an interesting experience. Sadly, that formula became a little self-indulgent by the final act.As I mentioned, Guy Richie, who directed this film, has a very unique style. To get the negative out of the way first, without ruining anything for viewers, there is a scene towards the end of the movie that breaks the fourth wall in ways I haven't seen in a while. That particular scene left a bad taste in my mouth, but I enjoyed the rest of the movie too much to let that be a huge detractor. From his witty/snappy dialogue to his hilarious choices of the way certain characters speak, he has certainly not lost touch with the types of movies he likes to make. For myself, this one just happened to work for me, more than any of his previous original work.From Matthew McConaughey to Charlie Hunnam (who is fantastic in this role), Colin Ferrell to Henry Golding, and the rest of the endless talent, The Gentlemen is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to the talent on-screen. I was actually worried throughout the first 20 to 30 minutes that it felt a little messy and that these actors wouldn't have many ways to shine, but I was wrong. This movie finds its footing by the end of the first act and never lets up. I was thoroughly impressed by the acting, screenplay, and overall editing throughout the film, that my complaints never ruined my enjoyment.In the end, The Gentlemen isn't a perfect movie and Guy Richie definitely pats himself on the back a little too often this time, but I would be lying if I didn't say I had an absolute blast. The dialogue came a mile-a-minute and it was either important to the story, clever for the sake of being clever, or simply hilarious, and I just ate that aspect up. The quick style of this movie won't be for everyone, but if you happen to enjoy that sort of thing, then you may just love this movie. I like that style when it's done well and it really worked for me here. The Gentlemen is a fun time and I recommend checking it out.",

            "content": "Once in a while comes a movie that centres on a violent crime caper that will either make it or break it. Guy Ritchie's gangster-comedy, The Gentlemen is one that is entertaining as hell though it asks viewers to carry the load much higher than most of other commercial movies because Ritchie's style of providing information is skilled like a sharp shooter person.The Gentlemen unbuckles its load by telling the whole narrative with a real sense of maturity. There is an impalpable weight the audience has to carry during the two hours but the lumbersome feels as if it was afloat in a suction of vacuum because the narrative would keep you intrigued to the very end. The story is told in a uniquely satirical way that would unquestionably amuse viewers who would consider themselves as cinephiles. What wonders us is Ritchie is able to mix the satirical ingredient into the rich storytelling perfectly just like the prince who found out that Cinderella's feet is the most fitting for the sparkling silver high heels. However, the film bounces back and forth which is not easy to follow but as long as your mind does not detract from the real deal, you are along for the ride.With the title suggests a group of classical men, the actors' performance/character is the essence of the film. McConaughey's Mickey is boosted with the oh-so-handsome charisma that not only is indispensable for the narrative, but would also drool your girlfriend. Charlie Hunnam is brilliant as always, this extremely underrated actor proves that he's always got something to offer which The Gentlemen has provided ample time for him to rival against those who have the audacity to look away his talents. Fletcher, played by Hugh Grant is the main storyteller here, giving the audience directions for what's about to come while doing his best Cockney accent. Jeremy Strong as Matthew is in his name, a strong contender. This will probably be his breakthrough career in the industry. Farrell plays Coach, he is great portraying a cocky head slash boxing trainer with a handful of minions to hang around with. The only female here is Dockery as Mickey's beloved wife who acts in full shrewd and confident. Everyone is remarkable here except for one, Henry Golding. His character is not a memorable villain and the offering gets worse with his acting. With his irritating perennial lips movements like a sided-O everytime he talks in every movie added on top of his try-hard expression, he is perhaps the weakest link of the movie.An exciting part to talk about in this kind of films would be the action set pieces unfortunately, The Gentlemen does not offer much. With those that is familiar with Ritchie's past works (not Aladdin sorry), he is capable to entertain audience with frenetic action and violence. In his latest work, Ritchie's fans may be disappointed to see that the only actions lying around is assassination through targeted shootings. Not to mention that they are always served with repetitive style of negotiations before the action takes place, making it seems as if the movie barely has any at all.Which brings us to this part where the most exceptional thing is the outmaneuvering of one another to stay one step ahead of the opponent. Even greater when there are hilarious jokes to ice the ever-thicken plot as time runs out. It feels like a game of cat-and-mouse but it reveals itself in subtlety, thanks to the matured storytelling. The 'who is who' would keep you entertained 'till the end.First look on the poster and you'll see Kingsman. Second look and you'll probably say, this is a disguise to a Kingsman sequel. By the third look, everyone is already speculating the same thing like a link of wired brains. Ladies and gents, hold my beer. As shocking as it may sound, this is nothing like Kingsman. Nothing! From the storytelling, the action scenes down to the universe and its type of humours. Unless if you consider the costume design and some of the locations, then yes. In comparison, The Gentlemen makes Kingsman looks like child's play.For those looking forward on the costume design, you are in for a luck. Michael Wilkinson surely knows how to distinguish each character with each classic look. From the hair styles to the leather boots, he nails it! Not only The Gentlemen, but also Dockery as Rosalind is a charm beauty wearing that thick blazer suited with 1.5 inch circumference of golden-coloured buttons.Ritchie offers a movie about the men without focusing on the 'woke' subject nor does he care about being politically motivated. If one should care, then The Gentlemen provides the opposite of supporting the men... nor the women. It contains strong language that is offensive, racist and homophobic. Not to mention a gross sequence inspired by the debut episode of Black Mirror that is disturbing but deliberately hilarious.Verdict: Guy Ritchie proves again he is able to create an authentic storytelling, for those who are fans of his works would be pleased to follow the train. The Gentlemen is a work of art targeted for matured adults but not necessarily only for men and of which it has potential to be nominated for Best Costume Design & Best Screenplay at the grand awards early 2021!",

The film stars renowed actors including Matthew McConaughey and Guy Ritchie himself. The film was produced with a budget of $22 million and has grossed $110 million at the box so far.\nThe plot of the film follows Micheal Pearson played by Matthew McConaughey, a wealthy businessman who is been investigated by Big Dave, played by Guy Ritchie.\nMicheal Pearson is a marijuana kingpin who seeks to sell his business. Big Dave is an editor for the Daily print, a private investigation news outlet. The two clashed at a party but first time acquintance did not go well as Pearson refuses to shake hands with Big Dave. This gesture evoked the inqusitive spirit of Big Dave. He hires Fletcher, a private investigator to investigate Micheal Pearson's amicable relationship with Lord Pressfield, a royal duke with an addicted missing daughter. This brings Flecther in contact with Ray, Pearson's right-hand man. Fletcher's investigation reveals the dark side of marijauna business where vicious activities abound.\nThe film is racially balanced, giving it a warm global reception. The involment of Chinese mafia and gangs excited me. What I witnessed from this film is that, the East sees the drug business as a family legacy while the Western world sees it a an individual pathway to success. Fletcher's performance is fantastic. He was able to carry his investigation in a friendly and cleverly tone. The amicable connection between him and Ray spinned the film to its critical acclaims. Both parties were intelligent and objective. I really liked the calmness and timely eruptions of Ray's mannerisms.\nI have a strong feeling that this film will go down as one of the best Guy Ritchie's moments.\nI can bet my last coin on this film to be on any list of best original screenplays.

I do have a small problem with mythologising and glamourising criminals don't it only get a 3.5 from me.\nGeorge: Very unusual movie. Not my type of film generally and I didn't appreciate the bad language. It was an interesting story and I didn't know what was coming next or who was going to 'kick the bucket' next.

Charlie Hunham just looks like he got out from a Sons of Anarchy set.

            "content": "A yarn heard at the corner bar, loaded up with distortions and embellishments, where the narrator anticipates that you should take care of his bar bill toward the end. What's more, perhaps you wouldn't fret doing as such. The storyteller here is a scheming corrupt private criminologist (excess descriptive words, maybe) named Fletcher (Hugh Grant), who wonders in all he thinks about the meeting criminal-tranquilize master components working in England, and embarks to extort ... everybody ... with a screenplay he's composed, where he lays it hard and fast, naming names. Fletcher's screenplay is designated \"Shrub,\" bramble, for this situation, a code word for \"cannabis,\" this being a unimaginably confounded story about the \"turf war\" in the weed business: everybody realizes sanctioning is coming, and quick. The end days are near. The \"shrubbery\" ironic statement is additionally present, only for the laughs factor, and gives you a thought of the general tone.The players on board are an American named Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), who sees an open door in the grieving English privileged, sitting in their weather beaten houses longing for old fashioned \"Downton Abbey\" days. Mickey plunges in and cuts manages \"the toffs\" in return for being permitted to develop weed on the property. Discussing \"Downton Abbey,\" Mickey is hitched to Roz (Michelle Dockery, otherwise known as \"Woman Mary\" in \"Downton Abbey\"), a \"Cockney cleopatra\" (in Fletcher's words), who runs an auto body shop with just ladies mechanics. (More could be made of Roz and her business. It's intriguing, the impression we get.) Mickey cherishes his better half, and is prepared to resign from the weed business. Two adversaries develop as potential purchasers: an American Jewish extremely rich person (Jeremy Strong) and a Chinese-Cockney hoodlum named Dry Eye (Henry Golding). The special case is Colin Farrell's \"Mentor,\" an Irish person who runs a boxing club, who continues demanding he's not a hoodlum, despite the fact that he carries on reliably in criminal ish ways. Mickey's correct hand man is Ray (Charlie Hunnan), an unassuming man who appears as though a work area agent until you see him in real life. At that point he's frightening. The \"courteous fellows\" of the title is plainly implied snidely.How the entirety of this fits together is completely in the hands of Hugh Grant, who gives an unprecedented presentation, thinking about the conditions. The content, which Ritchie co-composed with Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies, messes with all the class tropes, however the abrogating structure is Fletcher \"pitching\" his content-of these alleged genuine occasions-to an undeniably frightened Ray. Fletcher is a parasite, one of those newspaper \"scholars\" who wants to be \"in\" on things, who considers individuals to be their notorieties for being expendable, who reveres clarifying the amount he knows, the amount he has caught with his bazooka-sized telefoto focal point. This \"pitch\" continues for the aggregate of the film, thus as scenes unfurl, with Grant describing them, it is just as the scenes radiate from Fletcher's creative mind, when in actuality we are seeing what truly occurred. Or on the other hand right? Fletcher is a long way from dependable. The whole content of \"The Gentlemen\" is extremely, at that point, a content inside a content, and this is its secret weapon. There's constantly one layer among us and the characters.I could have lived without the running jokes about \"clever sounding names\" (it's \"Sixteen Candles\"' \"In length Duk Dong\" once more), and I could have lived without the scene where an assault is undermined. The Jewish very rich person talks in a characteristically \"gay\" way (no other method to state it, he should drawl), and the counter Semitic generalization is everywhere. Perhaps that is the point, however it's a worn out point. Much is authentically interesting in \"The Gentlemen\" and much that is genuinely upsetting. These things felt motiveless and modest.",

School boy repetitive offensive language for no real reason but an attempt to shock or be funny (FYI it did neither).

I'm still left in the limelight of this dance. From an all-star cast to gorgeous camerawork this film offers a complete film for two hours.I enjoyed the complete aspect of the story in the film being told as a story for a film. In this regard, a narration of events for the future consideration of a movie being put together in our fictional world. With the story being narrated and subsequently acted out through each other the jump between past and present is seamless, and quite enjoyable.The camerawork was beautiful in my eyes. The biggest example that made the camerawork enjoyable was as follows. When a character was on the left side of the table there was space to their front, our right, and when a character was on the right side of the table there was space to their front, our left. This gave the enjoyment of actually going back and forth the table of conversation. Some movies tend to place characters dead center thus making the conversation work, but not entirely enjoyable.Lastly, the ensemble was perfect. Even with high profile actors, some films fall short, but for me, not in this case. The chemistry worked well and each character was definitive in who they were and what they represented. No one felt out of place and the range of emotion was brought to a front in each and every scene.Overall:\nThis film will definitely be added to my \"Must Watch\" list of 2020*. Storyline, cinematography, and character/actor chemistry was spot-on from start to finish. Although riddled with swearing throughout. I found that it adds to the authenticity I believe is \"gangster\" England. If you can get past the large amount of use of the word c*** then I think you'll be fine.Enjoy the show!*I did some digging and although the premier was in 2019. \"The Gentlemen\" falls into the 2020 awards season, and therefore I'm classifying it as a 2020 film compared to the 2019 stat in IMDb.",

McConaugheys character is very similar to his character out of true detective which is fairly enjoyable but nothing new. Now the rest of the story has a few entertaining moments and Colin Farrell is great but there really isn't anything else to enjoy.

Is it mildly formulaic? Yes, but is it a fantastic watch? Yes! And I have to say, that's kind of the point when you're going to the big screen. In essence it's a story about a drug lord trying to get out, but can't, with all the classic Guy Ritchie antics along the way.I've read some of the \"critics\" on this movie and find that once again they're completely off the mark when it comes to understanding what audiences want. The nearly all male cast was on point. We know Guy Richie doesn't write compelling female characters (circa Rock n' Rolla), so why waste your time - and what's wrong with \"enticing a male-heavy demographic\"? The anti-woke jokes and witty dialogue were on point. The classic boxing ring side scene (and even the car trunk scene for that matter) proved this sentiment exactly - men cuss each other out of love, get over it - and was a much needed middle finger to today's socio-political environment (as other recent movies (The Joker) have also compellingly done so.) And finally, the spaghetti western meets London gangster ensemble was also on point. It is what he does best, so why fix something that isn't broken?For the so-called critics and toffs too blind to see something deeper, look past the realistically played London yobbos and see snapshots portraying the very real London class and generational divide. Look past the slapstick humour and see the changing face of London portrayed through it's changing music, it's variety of faces, it's changing dress sense, it's issues with knife crime, the destruction of today's youth potential by hard narcotics, the story of a gym coach training disadvantaged youths to be better and see that a woman can run a successful high end car garage. The obligatory woke nod had to be there, but it didn't feel as such because it wasn't forced (MU EndGame or Rise of Skywalker), but actually relevant to- and impacting the storyline in significant ways.Performances were fantastic bar a few minor accents fails, and although I was sceptical about Hugh Grant playing (gay?) gangster I was very pleasantly surprised! I'm not sure the very British humour (including it's cuss words/phraseology) will be understood by those outside the UK but am sure it'll be the reason this movie gets poor ratings. I loved the Toddlers, their intro and names were hilarious as was their fighting, acting and portrayal within London today. I thoroughly enjoyed the Easter Eggs; the nod to Quentin Tarantino style camera/film pull-back and on-screen scribbling, the parody of poorly dubbed Chinese films, the visit to Miramax, and the moment when Michelle Dockery (who plays Rosalind) had her Will Smith style MIB deadly-pea-shooter moment were all just brilliant.My only beef, a potential plot hole that came at the end, the shooting from the back of the van. How did they know where to be and who, how...? Maybe I missed something, but that seemed like a hole that ruined the end for me.Overall, a definite return to form. Classic Guy Richie story, done well, modernised, with a peppering of just the right amount of anti-woke and British humour to make you laugh from start to finish.Even my very \"proper\" wife enjoyed it.",

            "content": "Guy Ritchie is one of those directors who makes my head tingle when I hear that he has a new movie coming to town. As soon as I hear his name, I immediately begin to imagine what new spattering of crime, English charm (and repulsiveness), violence, and asynchronous storytelling that will only become clear as the credits begin to roll... I will witness in theaters or at home. Ritchie's newest offering, The Gentleman, does not disappoint.The Gentleman invites a new twist this time around, placing an American in the starring role. Matthew McConaughey leads an all-star cast of action adventurists and comics, including Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant, Colin Farrell, Eddie Marsan, and Henry Golding, through a winding story of deception, violence, and backstabbing all in the name of business. McConaughey plays Michael Pearson, an American former Rhodes Scholar who capitalized on his uncanny ability to produce and sell white widow cheese (that's marijuana for those of us less educated botanists) and is now on the verge of retirement. As Michael Pearson moves to sell his operation to businessman Matthew (Jeremy Strong), Pearson's world begins to unravel in a complex tale that leaves you rooting for the heroes who would be considered villains in a court of law.Ritchie's film is a masterclass in screenwriting. The entirety of the story comes tightly packed as a screenplay within a screenplay, allowing opportunist Fletcher (Hugh Grant) to reveal the plot to Pearson's top gunman Ray (Charlie Hunnam) outside of tie and space.Nearly every breathing second of the film is full of A+ soundtrack, action, comedy, and unexpected twists. The Gentlemen is a rollercoaster and one of the most easily enjoyable films of 2019.",

This movie is so cool, from the slick, fast, sometimes even poetic dialogue, the accents, the performances, the characters. Everything about it screams Guy Ritchie and it is really good.There are some scenes in the movie that I think will become classics and maybe this movie will too, I don't know, only time will tell, but a lot of it reminded me of the cleverness of the characters in Snatch. The performances are fantastic, I think Hugh Grant is the best I've ever seen him ever, with a completely different accent and also Charlie Hunnam is so damn cool here, as well.The only negatives I have with the film is that, as is usual for a Guy Ritchie film is that from the very beginning it moves at breakneck speed, introduces a bunch of characters and quite honestly, at times in the film I didn't really know what they were talking about. And also, I love Guy Ritchie, but sometimes he does sacrifice substance for style and I think in some scenes the same thing happens here.I though the first act was the weakest because it introduced too many characters and plot lines, but the movie got better each minute, and I really liked it in the end and definitely want to watch it again, soon.",

            "review_title": "A Guy Ritchie Classic",
            "content": "Guy Ritchie supplies is with another exhilarating watch, the polished screenplay entails an impressive cast, all playing there part in a story of uncertainty. The plot begins with Big Dave, editor of the Daily Print tabloid, snubbed by cannabis baron Mickey Pearson, played by Matthew McConaughey, at a party and hires private investigator Fletcher, mastered by Hugh Grant, to investigate Pearson's links to Lord Pressfield, a Royal Duke with a heroin-addicted daughter. Fletcher offers to sell his findings (typed up as a screenplay entitled 'Bush') to Pearson's right-hand man, Raymond, for \u00a320,000,000. Instantly confronted with a quality cast, Charlie Hunnam performs as an intimidating, tough figure standing loyal to Pearson, who's best known for his rebellious behaviour and greed for profit. The film is told as a story by Grant's character, with all other events in the past, his mysteriously slow speech adds a chilling sense to the feature, and his confidence in his investigation is rather smug. Pearson plans to sell his business to American billionaire Matthew Berger for \u00a3400,000,000 so he can retire peacefully with his wife, Rosalind. Pearson introduces Berger to one of his labs where he grows his cannabis under the estates of aristocratic landlords, who need cash for the upkeep of their stately homes. Pearson is later approached by Dry Eye, an underboss for Chinese gangster Lord George. Dry Eye offers to buy out Pearson's business, but he refuses. Pearson's lab is then raided by amateur MMA fighters and aspiring YouTubers \"The Toddlers\" who overpower the lab's guards, steal a van-load of marijuana and upload a rap video of their caper online. The fighters' trainer, known only as Coach, orders them to delete the video and is horrified when he discovers that the cannabis belongs to Pearson. As Fletcher's explanation speeds up, the tale experiences a transition, a turn of events from the comforting, successful life of Mickey Pearson. The Coach, played expertly by Colin Farrell, possesses a thick Irish accent and proves his ability when single handedly beating up a group of teenagers in a cafe. Dry Eye, played by Henry Golding, is brutal in his want to achieve the maximum in the drug business, informing to Mickey that the young will replace the old. Pearson begins transferring his cannabis plants out of the estates. He also agrees to bring home Pressfield's wayward daughter Laura. Raymond retrieves Laura from a council estate where she is living with several other addicts. However, in a brawl with her flatmates one of Raymond's men accidentally pushes Aslan, a young Russian man, out of the window to his death. Although Laura was then returned to her parents, she later dies of a heroin overdose, found in an emotional scene by her grieving parents. Coach visits Raymond, apologises for his student's actions, and offers his services as penance. Coach has captured Phuc, a henchman of Dry Eye's who had informed Coach's crew about the lab location, although Phuc is accidentally killed during a botched escape attempt. Pearson threatens Lord George for going after his lab, and in retaliation, destroys one of his heroin labs. George chastises Dry Eye for his insubordination in attacking Pearson and offering to buy him out; George nods to a henchman to execute Dry Eye, but the man executes George instead. Dry Eye's manipulation is clear and his plan to become a drug kingpin is something he is close to achieving. Henry Golding doesn't usually play the menacing, merciless sinner, but engages convincingly. It is worth noting that as viewers we can't help but admire Coach, his sense of humour, cool nature and will to change \"The Toddlers\" into good people, his role is critically underrated. Unknown to Pearson, Dry Eye is in league with Berger, who had wanted Pearson's business disrupted to reduce the price. Dry Eye has taken Lord George's place and still hopes to take Pearson's empire for himself. Dry Eye tries to kidnap Rosalind, who kills Dry Eye's men before she run out of bullets in her two-shot derringer. Raymond kills an assassin sent to kill Pearson; the two rush to Rosalind and Pearson kills Dry Eye. Fletcher ends his story and Raymond orders him to leave his house. Fletcher's overall characterisation is ghostly, his conceited tone manifests his omniscience, surprised that Raymond sees out the story, we suggest there is still another chain of events to be released. Fletcher has merely confirmed Pearson's suspicions about the link between Dry Eye and Berger. Raymond orders Coach's students to capture Big Dave. They drug him and film him having sex with a pig, threatening to post it online unless he drops his investigation. Pearson and Berger meet up again in a frozen fish plant, actually a cover for Pearson's European distribution operation. Berger drops his offer to $130,000,000, on account of the recent disruptions it had experienced, but Pearson reveals his knowledge of Berger's plan, shows him Dry Eye's frozen body and tells him he is keeping his business. Pearson forces Berger inside a freezer, where he will freeze to death unless he transfers $270,000,000 compensation and, for the assault on Rosalind, cuts \"a pound of flesh\" from his own body. As the film comes to a conclusion, McConaughey's character shows heroic actions in saving his wife and confronting Berger, his portrayal across the film as a whole is proficient, encapsulating the courage required to complete and finish his business. Fletcher, once again, approaches Raymond for his payment, but Raymond reveals that he was tailing Fletcher all along. The fighters have stolen his stashes of evidence after Raymond placed a tracker inside his shoe during their last encounter. Fletcher reveals that he has also sold information to Aslan's father, a Russian oligarch and former KGB agent. Coach kills the two Russian triggermen sent to kill Raymond, while Fletcher escapes in the chaos. Pearson is kidnapped by two other Russians, but they are ambushed by Coach's students who want to \"solve Coach's problem\". They assault the car with bullets, killing the Russians and allowing Pearson to escape. Later, Fletcher decides to pitch the story as a film to Miramax. After his meeting, he gets into a taxi only to realise that Raymond is the driver. Upon learning of Fletcher's capture, Pearson and Rosalind return to their cannabis empire and celebrate in each other's company. Director Guy Ritchie once said that he got into film-making because he was interested in making entertaining movies, who he felt there was a lack of, 'The Gentleman' is nothing short of entertaining. The process of telling the story through the viewpoint of Fletcher is magnificent. The film itself, lasting for 113 minutes, supplies fine acting, laugh-out-load one liners, and breathtaking action. The story is a chain of events, with one feature setting off another etc. The constant blackmail and schemes to undermine Mickey Pearson emphasise the seriousness of the drug business and how every figure is tied into the profession in some way. In the same spirit as Ritchie's kLock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Snatch', 'The Gentleman' grossed a total of $115 million in all territories. The already successful hit was critically noted for its racist undertones and coarse language, however, the excellent screenplay is positively seen as a welcome return to form for Ritchie.

I would have to admit, having spent time in Oklahoma, I have SERIOUS doubts anyone from a trailer park there would ever apply to Oxford. But it's a movie. Henry Golding was very impressive too, definitely Bond-caliber IMO.If you know Ritchie, you know what to expect from him, I consider this likely to be better than Snatch, maybe even better than Lock, Stock. Good to see him taking movies seriously again.",

Again just a heads up.\nMister nice guy Henry Golding from Crazy rich Asians, was just creepy cause you know he is such a heart throb but then he opens his mouth with obscenities ,and he becomes an all round unlikable dude.\nCharlie Hunnam as Mathews security detail is understated but a standout at the same time .Watch the scene where he is in the druggies den .He takes loyalty to new heights.\nBut to me the standout was Colin Farrell as the coach of the toddlers(picture Eggsie from The Kingsmen )He had some of the best lines especially in the Gym with the black dude, and the pig scene .PMSL.All said in his beautiful Irish accent.\nOh did I mention the plethora of Cee U Next Tuesday references .\nActually there were so many of them I nearly had to look up the cast list just to double check there wasn't a character named U. N .T.\n(Hate that word by the way)\nFull of great dialogue classic back to basics Guy Ritchie.\nLook for the reference to one of Guy Richie's other movies in the last scene with the Harvey Weinstein look a like.Remember pay attention at the start cause it starts with flash backs but you dont realise it till Hugh starts to tell the story and what a story teller he is .Best performance since Love Actually(My opinion anyway,No English fop to be seen in this movie.\nWorth seeing this a second time as I know I missed things .\n4.9 out of 5 best movie of the year hahaha",

His right hand man Ray (Charlie Hunnam) has been approached by sleazy journalist Fletcher (Hugh Grant), who thinks he's got the lowdown on a plot to overtake his empire, with Triad gangster Dry Eye (Henry Golding) at the helm, but the truth is more scattershot than he might have thought.Despite having made a name for himself in Hollywood, Guy Ritchie is still best known for his distinctive British gangster capers, of which The Gentlemen feels like an affectionate, retrospective throwback to. It's as if he didn't want to become detached from the formula that he set out with, and had to prove that he could still pull it off. The result is a serviceable, competent piece of work, though ultimately unremarkable, with a convoluted plot that does it no good.Ritchie has assembled an all star cast, ranging from American import McConaughey in the lead, and even established stars like Colin Farrell in a comic supporting role, while big British star Grant chews the scenery as a sleazy reporter, a subtle nod, no doubt, to his real life showdowns with the tabloids. It's all a big, glossy, polished affair, with the director's trademark humour still in dark abundance, just with something missing that means it doesn't hold up to his classic early work.In a day and age when crime thrillers have taken on a style all of their own, a new Guy Ritchie film truly stands alone as a particular type of affair. While The Gentlemen doesn't stand up to the quality of his early films, it's still a pleasing, darkly funny throwback to those days. ***",

This film follows Michael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) and Ray (Charlie Hunnam) as they try to sell off Pearson's highly profitable marijuana empire in the drug territory of London, triggering plots, schemes, bribery and blackmail in an attempt to steal his domain from under him.\nThe ensemble cast is breath-taking; Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Michelle Dockery, Colin Farrell, Henry Golding and Hugh Grant. I would've loved to see more scenes with Hunnam and McConaughey because they work really well together and bounce off each other really well.\nThe structure of the story is quite unique as the entire plot is being told like a story from Fletcher's (Hugh Grant) perspective to Ray. As the narrative advances the action starts to become full of twists especially with Pearson and Matthew (Jeremy Strong) nearer the end of the film.\nHowever, this film isn't perfect. In the 3rd act's sound design is way too loud so it is difficult to here the dialogue. Also, it does take a while for it to get off the mark but when it does it is great.\nOverall, I loved this film and it is obvious to see Ritchie's style bleed into every scene. I highly recommend this if you do not mind a lot of strong language.",

When it leaks out that he is thinking of getting out, numerous plots are hatched to determine who gets what. The story of what is happening is told to McConaughey's right hand man, Hunman by creepy private eye Grant who expects to receive a lot of money for not leaking the story.This is Ritchie on familiar British gangster territory coupled with his penchant for creating wonderfully eccentric characters who spurt out endless witty lines punctuated with moments of strong violence. Grant is on the top of the pile here and pretty much steals the show, but Farrell and Dockery are also great fun playing very much against type and McConaughey is a good solid lead.As with all of Ritchie's films. this is a tad complex and some of it doesn't stand up to close scrutiny, but it's a lot of fun with plenty of twists and turns and moves along at an enjoyably swift pace.",

To like Guy Ritchie's movies is like liking my grandma's borscht - other people may not fancy it even a tiny bit, but I grew up with it and I like it a lot.What I'm trying to say is that if you approach Ritchie's movies looking for an action movie, say Die Hard type of thing (not that is anything wrong with it), you'll be disappointed and you'll not going to like it, you'd be eating the borscht where you expected the burger. But if you open your mind to my grandma's cooking, and give her culinary masterpiece a chance, you'll find all the intricate tastes and finesse you never find in minced beef. And that's The Gentlemen for you: all the ingredients that youd never dream of liking separately mixed together in one wonderful dish. The cinema at its best, intelligent, masterfully executed on every level: acting, directing, camera, editing, music, sound effects, all of it is just the way it should be and worthy of the fantastic cast and crew.Oh yes, and it's darn funny, if you dig that sort of humor, and I'd like to believe we all do...8 stars only because of the Snatch.

And now he's getting ready to retire and sell his herb empire, and he seems to be good to go, until some other interested buyers, or takers come into play, but when the cool calm and collected Mickey Pearson is pushed into a corner, well, first of all, you only think you pushed him into a corner and two he's gonna push back! Great movie from Guy Ritchie, more along the lines of Snatch than his recent gems like the Aladdin, King Arthur, Man from Uncle, or remember that time Madonna and him were together so he was forced by God to put her in a movie called Swept Away? Ugh... This is the kind of movie he shines, each character explodes on the screen. My favorite had to be Colin Farrell as Coach, and yes he is a basketball coach, and he does jobs for the organization and for fun beats up unruly teens. Hugh Grant was also great as a sleazeball, bribing journalist/wanna be screen writer.. Great flick, go check it out! Filmbufftim on FB",

On the other hand I really disliked his King Arthur and skipped Aladdin. After watching the trailer of The Gentlemen I thought he was returning to his own style. Although movie reflects his style and narration of the movie could be considered as good. As a crime and mob boss movie it is not sufficient at all. Nearly all actors are very good in the movie but action scenes were very little and that's one of the biggest disappointment of the movie. I also expected some violence\nfrom this movie and it was nowhere to be found.\nMaybe it is not the director's worst movie but it is a very mediocre movie however its strong cast gave a very solid performance.",

At times the dialogue walks a racial tightrope, which I don't think has helped the overall rating here, while the C-bomb is used generously throughout. From what I've read online, this latter fact has horrified American viewers, who seemingly have not yet adopted the C-word as a staple of the English language as us Brits have.For any American viewer confused by this cultural phenomenon, I'll hand you over to The Coach (Colin Farrell) who hits the nail on the head when explaining to one of his boys that the word can be used as a term of \"familial affection\". That scene had me laughing out loud - it's also a perfect example of an instance whereby the script wobbles that aforementioned tightrope.I believe I loved The Gentlemen for aspects that other viewers hated. I'm sure what can be universally agreed however is the acting, soundtrack and storytelling are all absolutely on point. Special shoutouts must go to Hugh Grant, Charlie Hunnam and Colin Farrell, who were all especially fantastic. Overall, The Gentlemen is a must watch. 9/10.",

If you're not engaged, you pay for this.The movie was, to me, not as smart as \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" (1998), as it was more complicated and harder to understand. Also, I really liked Brad Pitt in \"Snatch\" (2000) In here, I wasn't attached to any character.The only downside? It was a purely, 100%, totally, and a bit :)) absolutely logical movie. There were emotions in the movie, actors were living and immersing in it, the script and play had suspense, but other than making me laugh one time, I didn't have any other emotion.I give the movie a grade of 10, with the disappointment of emotions.",

Much has been said of Hugh Grant's performance, which is incredibly good, but I think Charlie Hunnam does a masterful job also. I always felt that Hunnam's performances in Sons of Anarchy were a little stale/one-note, but here he is knocking it out of the park.The film is fun throughout, but my complaint about the ending is that it isn't really clear what the Toddlers are up to. It seems as if we are initially meant to think that they are going to kill Pearson, but then it turns out that they are killing his captors instead, to solve Coach's \"problem\". I found it a little confusing, and I wonder if one or two minutes may have been cut during editing by mistake. This is a potential issue that must be difficult in a Guy Ritchie film, because they all have nonlinear stories and are full of hard/stylistic cuts. His prior films to me are clear despite the potential for confusion, and the only knock I have for The Gentlemen is that this one little detail doesn't quite work as perfectly as his films usually do.Despite that, I think the performances here are probably the best he's ever had. All of the actors are incredibly fun to watch, and the tension built in their dialogue is perfection to enjoy. I could watch Grant and Hunnam banter for hours, except that the other scenes are just as fun.",

There's just a lot of time spent on either exposition or conversations where nothing actually gets accomplished to move the plot forward.

Colin Farrell, Hugh Grant, and Michelle Dockery were more than capable of consistently carrying this burden, but the rest of the cast and the writing seemed to get tired at times.Overall, watching this movie is a little like watching Guy Ritchie.

            "content": "Guy Ritchie's return to the crime genre is loaded with guns, money, drinks, profanity and style, although it probably requires a viewing with subtitles and possibly more than one viewing. If you manage to not get caught up in the convoluted and often very slow storytelling, you'll find that The Gentlemen is a highly entertaining and funny crime-comedy, with a perfect shortage of action that mainly consists of gunfire anyway, well-written dialogue and extremely memorable characters.The brief scene that follows after the production logos and makes space before the delightfully-done opening credits sequence demonstrates the cinematography and lifelike picture quality that remains present throughout the entirety of the film. This is a fun, popcorn-worthy cinema movie that audiences shouldn't be taking too seriously, but it's also a gorgeous, golden-age visual performance deserving of a nomination for Academy Award for Best Cinematography. \"Because it is cinema; it's beautiful, beautiful cinema\".And due to all the unique writing of the lines, the splendid performances and the fashionable clothing they each wear, the greatest thing about The Gentlemen is each of the characters, who are sarcastically referred to in the title. Hugh Grant gives his most distinctive performance, Colin Farrell is just hilarious, Charlie Hunnam is the coolest of them all, Michelle Dockery provides us with a badass female star and Matthew McConaughey is an effortlessly brilliant protagonist. Each of them have their funny moments, cool scenes or more throughout the film.To be clever and unique, the story of a rich American expat trying to sell his profitable marijuana empire is told through a modest little screenplay written by one of the characters, but this is a love-or-hate deal. Sometimes, the story can be a little confusing, where you're not quite sure how to make of what events are real and when they occur, and for others, it will be extremely boring. But if your brain can work out with this task and understand what's going on, you'll likely find The Gentlemen a very entertaining Guy Ritchie movie (recommended with subtitles).If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",

What was a surprise for me was Hugh Grant. In an all star cast it's difficult to call out specific performances, as not one actor lets this film down.That said, Grant's performance in this film is something spectacular of it's self and should not go unnoticed.Overall this film is a classic Guy Ritchie style - if you like his films, you're going to like The Gentlemen. It will have you laughing out loud, gripped with an engaging narrative, and gasping at some of the violence (and again laughing at some of it).A must watch while out at the cinema.

Something smelt off. Then a flicker went off in my memory. Something connected. A vague memory that this might just be a Guy Ritchie movie. A few more minutes of wall to wall cliche made me certain. I decided to persevere, as Ritchie's films vary between the daftly watchable but instantly forgettable and the pompous and dull. I had hoped for the former, I got the latter. This film is dreadful. All the worst Ritchie trademarks are there. The infantile flashy 'look at me', gimmicky camera techniques, the tedious sub-Tarantino dialogue, the woeful acting performances squeezed like processed liver sausage out of a good cast, the macho cartoonish mockney roguery, all interspersed with the fortune cookie/spliffhead philosophy that really makes one ask questions, such as 'why the hell am I still watching this'. The entire cast are so constantly delighted by their own performances that you expect that they will turn to the camera at any moment and say - \"you didn't know I was this good did you\" before pausing to admire themselves in the mirror before returning dutifully to the script. But worst of all this film is just painfully dull. It takes a special talent to make something so incredibly ludicrous and hyperreal but at the same time so extraordinarily dull. For this reason I didn't even make it to the half-hour mark and, even though I didn't, I can still provide the following big spoiler - this film is very, very, very bad.",

The little action is effective, since the scenes are well done and the blood looks very real, although it does feel that it lacks a lot of action to be more violent. The characters have decent development although some seem caricatured due to the lack of extensive development. The performances are great as it always seems like you are seeing the character not the actors.

            "content": "This film was one of those that came out earlier this year and actually made it to the cinema but I missed it and now I have seen The Gentlemen and here is my review for the film. The premise sees an American drug manufacturer looking to sell his business in London which leads to many different parties looking to get involved.Main Character\nMatthew McConaughey plays the lead in this film and you can tell he really thrives in this role. He is intimdiating and charming mixed into one to make him this interesting character, you don't learn too much about him but that adds a bit to the mystique to his performance and he is just fun to watch.Supporting Characters\nThis film has a big cast and everyone does a good job, Charlie Hunnam plays a big part in the film and I thought he was good. He has his usual gruff here but he actually had quite a bit of personality in this film and again he just looked like he was having plenty of fun here. Hugh Grant has a big role and he is brilliant here, he like transforms here, if nobody told me this was Hugh Grant I would not have suspected it at all. He is funny and sarcastic with him really guiding us the audience through the film and really does a great job in leading us through the journey. Colin Farrell is also really good in this film, he is incredibly funny and charming, plus he is a really menacing but likeable presence which adds plenty to the film.Story\nThe positives for the story is that it is presented and told in a pretty unique way which suprised me and kept me on my toes. It also moves very quickly making you wonder what crazy thing is going to happen next which is something most films can't do. However, the actual plot is pretty basic, there isn't much unique about it, there are some gangsters and deals and backstabbings that you aren't that unpredictable plus a few of them could have been cut out in order to make the better parts of the plot more interesting.Script\nThe script has plenty of quick witted and sharp dialogue, the humour is there to make these funny characters and add to the hyper reality that is on show. Though the dramatic dialogue was lacking for me, I wasn't sure why the characters fully cared about each other or felt there lives were in danger because the film doesn't take the time to focus on it.Style\nThe style of the film is great, it is ridiculous and over the top, it has violence throughout which is to be expected and as mentioned it moves really quickly which does keep you interested throughout.Overall\nOverall, this is a real return to form for Guy Ritchie and it is a great watch which is full of fun and worth a watch if you like this style of film.Rating - 8/10.",

Still it doesnt have the touch films like \"Snatch\" or \"Lock, Stock...\" or their Cleverness but it is at least getting close to that.\nThe actors obviously had a lot of fun and that reflects in their Performances. First we have Matthew McConaughey, who is simply perfect for the role of an american marijuna farmer who tries to sell his Business and gets involvoed into a lot of Trouble with it. McConaughy's coolness and sneakiness totally fits that role. A great turn also by Charlie Hunman who really has a fantastic character on Hand with many different facettes and that is hard to figure out at the beginning. The greatest Performance however came from Hugh Grant, who is actually Award worthy and wonderfully Plays against his typical stereotype. He is the true Scene stealer of the Ensemble. Last but certainly not least we have Colin Farrell who absolutely fits a Guy Rithchie movie or character. Michelle Dockery also has her Moments but sadly was a Little bit underused. Its fun, sometimes a bit contridictive for its on good but good crime Comedy entertaninment with a Little bit of mystery.",

It's got every element you'd expect from Ritchie, and while I would say it doesn't disappoint, The Gentlemen also doesn't quite live up to Ritchie's masterpieces like Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels or Snatch. By no means does that mean this is a weak film, I do think it was a stronger effort than RocknRolla. Hugh Grant leads with a fascinating performance as a private investigator who also doubles as a narrator of sorts who Ritchie uses as a vehicle to unfold and explain the story in a truly unique manner. Colin Farrell has some show stealing moments as Coach, and he seriously might be the best part of the whole movie. The Gentlemen is cool, fast and fun. If you've enjoyed any of Ritchie's previous work in the genre, you'll want to check this one out.",

His previous forays into Slapstic Noir at least stuck up for the little guy (even if the little guy was a criminal). This one, from the start, gives all the winning cards to the hero, a former Rhodes Scholar (yeah, right!) turned multimillionaire drug kingpin, played by Matthew McConaughey. He's an arrogant, menacing bully in a three-piece suit who starts out on top, punishes everyone who tries to get in his way, and ends up... on top. (And if he's not repellent enough, he has a particularly repellent wife.)No one who opposes the hero gets away with it. For some reason, McConaughey's enemies in the film never seem to surround themselves with enough protection, even though they're involved in drug deals with hundreds of millions of pounds at stake. Two key characters who've tried to outsmart him simply walk unguarded into his trap, sans bodyguards, as if they're just asking to be punished. A hostile tabloid owner is easily kidnapped, drugged, and humiliated. And London's top Chinese crime lord is caught sipping tea alone in a pub like a sitting duck, so that he can be taught a lesson when McConaughey simply strolls into the room with a pair of thugs in tow.The moral is that might makes right - which makes for a fairly unsatisfying two hours.",

Matthew McConaughey even toned down his southern drawl for the occasion. And if you're looking for something to complain about, it would be the performance of Jeremy Strong.

Well, I'm not talking about 'loving' or 'hating' Ritchie's films, but let's be frank: he's not going to go down as one of the world's greatest filmmakers, so you are either amused by Guy Ritchie's schtick or you find it increasingly irritating.Me, I tend to like it, even though his various hits (and there have been one or two misses) are pretty much the same film over again. But then they say that 'it's not the joke, but the way you tell it'. And Ritchie has patented an entertaining way of telling what, let's again be frank, are nothing but shaggy dog stories.It would be pointless to outline 'the story' of the film, because 'the story' is totally irrelevant. It's how Ritchie tells 'em which does the biz. And, oh well, I don't doubt my credibility will now go down the pan, but I like how he tells 'em.His cast all turn in very entertaining performances, there are more than enough slick lines and turns of phrase to satisfy and it - as usual - rolls along nicely. The confusion is eventually sorted out. All you have to do is hang in there.As for that cast, special mention should go to Hugh Grant who plays totally against type as a sleazy, gay, murky, East London hack who takes it into his head to try to blackmail Matthew McConaughey's cannabis big shot, and who is not quite as clever as he thinks he is.As usual user reviews say this is 10/10 'brilliant, man' or that it's 1/10 'complete trash'. It's neither: it's unpretentious, entertaining Ritchie fare. And, and as I say, you either go for it or you don't. If you like his schtick, this is very much your bag so watch it. If you don't, well, find something else to do.",

It never grabbed me or kept me interested. I might come back and see if there was something wrong with me that night but I doubt it. I really like Hugh Grant and I was looking forward to his part in the movie but that too was a disappointment because the English man that he portrayed was evidently from the backwoods of London and it made him look and sound stupid.

The screenplay is so clever and there's so many layers to it. The acting is great too; the cast has insane talent. The pacing was very smart and consistent, which really makes The Gentlemen watchable.The plot is very Guy Ritchie, you've got gangsters, drugs, and pigs. Guy Ritchie's films are very similar and they become predictable, so Guy Ritchie adds a death scene at the beginning, to then add a twist. Guy Ritchie's self awareness and brilliance is what made The Gentlemen stand out. The pacing is so consistently good, and I was always hooked to the plot. The story is narrated by a real time conversation through two characters; and this type of story telling is a hit or miss, but it works so well in The Gentlemen. I don't think any other screenwriter can do as good a job as Guy Ritchie in The Gentlemen.The cast is a big selling point in Guy Ritchie movies and it's no different here. Mathew McConaughey did a solid job and so did Charlie Hunnam. Unfortunately, I think the actors are more interesting than the characters. The only character that got a good amount of exposition was Michael Pearson. There wasn't enough information about Charlie Hunnam's character, Ray. The Gentlemen does focus a lot on developing the plot and not so much on the characters, so at least it was done intentionally.The Gentlemen was a solid Guy Ritchie flick, that's entertaining and likable. The screenplay is my favorite part about The Gentlemen, which is then followed by the great casting. The real thing lacking in The Gentlemen are the characters, which were poorly developed in my opinion.",

To be honest, the first aspect, with its moans about death duties and trespassing plebs, and its implicit assumption that everybody wants to be a chinless wonder, is a bit unsavoury. But this is less arch, less pleased with itself, than Lock, Stock..., and more genuinely fun. There are some really entertaining turns from some surprising people, most notably Hugh Grant playing a non-posho for probably the first time in his career. Entertaining though he is, mind you, his chav-facing (like Ritchie's) is a bit inappropriate: it seems as though his slimy character is a walking promotion for his anti-tabloid pressure group Hacked Off. Tabloids as the lowest form of life - really, in a film about drug lords?Still - and it's not saying all that much - I think it's Ritchie's best film.

I liked Mathew McConaughey and Charlie Hunnam as the two protagonists and I thought that most of the cast was great.My criticisms, I found Jeremy Strong's character annoying and I thought that the film could have been longer, after finishing I wanted to watch more which isn't necessarily a bad thing but left me feeling like there could have been another 30 minutes, specifically more action because when there was action it was really good, it just felt a bit few and far between. Still I really enjoyed the film over all and unless you have an aversion to the C word you'll probably enjoy the film.",

            "content": "This film just proves that Guy Ritchie still has plenty of brilliance left in him, and that his top form has always been met with these types of stories.\nCrime and gangsters is where his direction shines and his stories excel what is needed for the genre. He always seems to provide more, and yet leaves us wanting more. With a very clever script and masterful storytelling, Ritchie paints a charming and witty tale of colorful characters and funny situations that turn this into an incredibly entertaining film. Evidently this well-oiled machine works as well as it does not only because of Mr. Ritchie's outstanding ability to craft such a phenomenal piece of work but also the stellar cast that is featured in the film. From Matthew McCounaghey's serene and determined mob boss, to the awkward and calculating Fletcher played astonishingly by Hugh Grant, and the hilarious Colin Farrell, who steals every scene he is in, delivering his lines with such confidence and humour, which I don't believe is the character's intention, he speaks seriously but a lot of the things he says are actually really funny, which is something incredibly hard to pull without coming off as overdone or just plain fake. So kudos to Farrell, and the rest of the cast as well who give out splendid performances, which is hard to accomplish in an ensemble piece, but in this case, everyone is remarkable.The narrative aspect is another standout, which contains multiple layers and twists that keeps the story flowing freshly and creatively. I would go as far as to say that this is definitely one of Ritchie's best not only in the gangster genre but of his entire career. That's how great this film is: cohesively put together, a plot that doesn't tire at any minute but keeps you engaged and entertained thanks to its pace, clever writing, hilarious dialogue and spectacular performances. The Gentlemen is a no-brainer. Go watch it now and see what Guy Ritchie does best.",

He is absolutely sublime as the seedy, blackmailing photographer, Fletcher. Playing entirely against type, Grant gives a career-best performance which will have you both cringing and laughing uncontrollably in equal measure.I've never taken to Matthew McConnaughey before this (I've always referred to him as 'The Mumbler'), but he does an excellent job here as cannabis kingpin Michael Pearson, ably supported by Ray (a hilarious Charlie Hunnam). Yet Colin Farrell pops up mid-film and nearly steals the show as a boxing coach trying to save souls from a life of crime.Taking in the UK cannabis trade, the Chinese & Russian Mafia, the British Gentry and the gutter tabloid press, The Gentlemen never lets up in laughs, twists and sheer entertainment value.It's a Tarantino-esque film for geezers and a must-see.

I remember calling it \"the death of Disney\" I realise now that was wishful thinking. Disney is immortal. However, I can't dispute money and Aladdin made that, which is why most were surprised that it was announced that Richie's next venture (The Gentleman) was going to be something altogether more in keeping with his previous reputation.You can feel through the lens that Guy Richie is enjoying coming back to the fold, he uses every trick and joke to emphasis this. The entire premise of the film is that Fletcher (played by an outstandingly slimy Hugh Grant) is pitching his idea for a film to Raymond (Charlie Hunnam), something I am positive Guy Richie has done multiple times before. The story is complete with a reshoot of scenes (when Fletcher diverts too far from the truth) and even a comment about aspect rations for the picture. The title of Fletcher's film he wishes to make? \"Bush\". Something tells me that in a drawer in Guy Richie's house is the same title for Lock Stock and Two Smokin' Barrels.It's nice to see that Richie has learned something in the intervening years between the truly dreadful Revolver and today. Richie has learned how to keep current with both tone and characters while keeping the more classical aspects of the genre intact. It's as if he has wholesale lifted characters from The Long Good Friday and transported them to the new millennium to face some of the more unexpected issues around. There is a moment where Raymond is faced off with several youths carrying knives while trying to acquire a mobile phone with incriminating evidence on, an issue I'm positive Colin never had to consider.The characters have too evolved with the times as opposed to the usual cut and paste hard as nails men, we are given a wide variety of parts to invest in. The most notable 4 are Raymond, Fletcher, Micky and The Coach. Each of these acts are unique, Raymond, for example, has an obsessive-compulsive disorder or The Coach who trains street kids to be better men both inside and outside the ring. These are troupes we have not seen from Richie before, he has grown.What has also grown is Richie's ability to tell a story, while films like Lock Stock, Snatch and even Rock'n'Rolla still stand up, you never realised how limited Richie's abilities were until they are highlighted by a movie like The Gentleman. In his previous work, it would be fair to say he is overly indulgent in a world he is clearly in love with. In The Gentleman, Richie chooses the high road giving us only flickers of the gangster underbelly while never letting up on the violence.The Gentleman is the perfect tonic of comedy, surprises, and outstanding acting. Like a good malt, Richie had to go through a few barrels first.10 Weeds out of 10",

Its yet another gripping film (though not perfect) with some very talented A-listers like Charlie Hunnam, Matthew McConaughey, Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell.You won't find many dull moments in this quirky dark comedy. It revolves around a cannabis mogul trying to sell his business - but in the wake of this, a series of errors and bad choices arise and well...you can imagine what might happen next if you know Guy Ritchie's prized formula.

Rock n Rolla wasn't bad at all, but it didn't have the \"zing\" or magnetism of the earlier films.The Gentlemen is a very welcome return to form, arguably his best work. The plot revolves around a major weed dealer who is looking to exit the criminal world....but will it really be that easy?! (Cinematic history tells us...no, it will not).The ensemble cast is absolutely fantastic, with everyone bringing their A Game. If you had to pick one standout it would be Hugh Grant who is hilarious and brilliant as the sleazy PI, \"Fletcher\".The way it's shot, is more traditional in nature, with less short shot collages, but as always the soundtrack is great, and more importantly the dialogue is on point! It has an impeccable balance between serious and satyr, all the way through...some moments are genuinely hilarious! (Normally around Colin Farrell).The story has a few twists and turns, and keeps you in uncertain territory right until the end!",

My opinion is fully slanted towards the favorable since watching Lock stock.To be quite honest, while this is is an original film, it's more of a slow burn rendition of previous London gangster Ritchie stories.The cast of characters each get their time to shine and steal the spotlight. There really isn't a \"main character\" and every protagonist an anti hero.Ritchie continues to show his theme of \"not that bad\" through MMS character dialogue about how his vice- weed- doesn't actually kill anyone, and tbh I have to appreciate it.The typical troupes I was yearning for were all there- excessive cockney slang, the anxiety of presumes violence (but only when necessary), and a 3rd act that has the serendipitous ending where everyone you rooted for makes it out, and the scumbag receives the sharp end of the karmic stick.I do wish there was more of Coach (Ferrell) and less Fletcher (Grant), but still loved it.My only wishlist item is that I'd woulda giggled if the narrator was Allen ford or vinny Jones, just to have a deep cut/call back to past films.",

Matthew McCon was perhaps a tad too classy for the part and the way he spoke reminded me a little of his role in True Detective. I was surprised by the little badness Hugh Grant seems to able to squeeze out in this role rather than the usual pouty posh parts he portrays in other films and is almost convincing enough to play a baddy.

A stylish, larger than life gangster movie it's got big names, lots of action & is liberally sprinkled with black humour. It's basically the story of a man who's made a fortune from growing & selling cannabis but who wants to sell his empire to retire from the business. Little does he know that his attempt to strike a deal will unleash all manner of mayhem. I've never been a fan of Hugh Grant but credit where credit's due - he's wonderful in this & definitely the standout performer. There is a cartoonish tone to the film so although there is quite a bit of violence, it's not the type that most people likely to find too graphic. If you are offended by swearing however then avoid this at all costs, since virtually every sentence spoken contains it.

It could easily be just another Gangster movie as there are better ones, however the way Ritchie stages this story and its characters is the film's true achievement. It is true that it is difficult to connect with the story in the beginning, perhaps because of the speed of the assembly or dialogue, but approaching the middle of the film it is inevitable to be fascinated by Ritchie's style, his way of narrating and the simple but smart you walk into without any problem waiting for the next move from the filmmaker.\nThis is how this film could be a rare mix between Scorsese's Gangster cinema and Tarantino's memorable dialogue, both of which come together in a film that results in the pure and enjoyable Guy Ritchie style.",

Matthew Mcconaughey was a delight but I have to say Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell were by far my favourite in this film. Although it's not going to be winning Oscars and critics praise, it is an entertaining watch, and a beautifully shot film - and seriously, what else do you need?",

His formula includes a lot of smart talking, accidental bumbling, stylish camera work and loads of characters crossing paths with each other causing this whole violent eruption about to climax.The bad first. Many like their gansta noir or gritty... Guy Ritchie's Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is one of my favorites till this say because it was fresh, and the many characters were consistent to who they were meant to be. The Gentlemen has its moments, but it was not as fresh, smart ass talking or even plot smart enough with its twists. And I'm not sure I dig the storytelling format, nor the ending.Having said that, just because it's not great doesn't mean it isn't good. The all-star cast does a fantastic job. I was most impressed with Hugh Grant, as well as Colin Farrel, Matthew McConnaughy, Chris Hunnan and Michelle Dockery, among a star studded cast. Good to see Jeremy Strong and Henry Golding as well)There were a few very intense, gritty moments done very well. Wished there were more hardcore gangsta dangerous moments.Rated 7 cuz not Guy Ritchie's best work. If you haven't already, watch Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels... or even Snatch.",

There is tremendous acting talent in this film with Matthew Mcconaughy, I found Hugh Grants part to be very amusing and entertaining. However, this film falls short in so many areas. Its forced diversity quota it had to meet ultimately ended up tainting it. The asian crime family felt particularly off and then came the \"buzy malone\" addition to the film....my word easily the worst and most out of place scenes in the entire movie. A random forced grime 'music' video into the film, the fighting scene was.....something you would see in a 1999 batman and robin film. It bugged me for the rest of the film I suppose you could say.By the end of movie it had me feeling that Guy Ritchie has lost touch with both the british crime genre and reality. But maybe the fact he based this so heavily around modern Britain explains why the british feeling so so absent.A movie for casual cinema goers and nothing more. I did not expect much from this film after seeing the trailer and sadly my worst fears were confirmed. It almost feels as if some sad imposter was trying to impersonate Guy Ritchies style.

It is, after all a regular ganster movie with regular conflicts. Lots of men in suits threatening each other, lots of talk about money, barely any females. I would even go so far as to say that this could be described as being style without substance, or (if I was being radical) as being the kind of movie that promotes a dangerous image of masculinity.BUT, that being said, I did enjoy it because it had everything I like about Guy Ritchie movies. I just love the fast cuts and the often absurd humor and the slickness of it all. As a female, I just have a thing for seeing neatly dressed guys with neatly cropped hair trying to outwit each other.So yeah, there were moments I found dry and the basic story is something I rather not think about too deeply, but I do think that it was quite well-made for what it was.",

All of characters were massive stereotypes but the representations of most of the white men were that they were powerful and rich and that they could transcend class through violence.\nThis was my favourite genre growing up.

The cast is superb and the way Guy Ritchie utilized their talents and mixed the actors in different scenes allowed almost everyone to work together in one way or another on set. This helped to showcase the depth of the individual actors while creating a cinematic masterpiece for those who love crime films especially, but also for those who do not. The dry humor and wit add an entirely different element not usually associated with this type of crime genre. Any critic that bashed or had anything negative to say about this film needs to get into a different career. Don't listen to them; watch it for yourself or you're missing out on a classic film. I was actually sad when it ended because it was so amazing and refreshing. I can't say enough about it and I hope it will inspire other film companies, writers, directors, and actors to do something similar in the future because we need more movies with the storytelling and passion that this classic brought to the audience.",

A weird reporter guy likes to spy on the mobster guy (and his trusty ultra-violent but dapper af sidekick). He want to use this to blackmail them for a lot of money. This is where the entertainment is. The sidekick guy is a badass. The reporter is witty, and annoying in a very endearing way. The sidekick guy's reaction to the reporter guy's story telling is actually extremely well done. They really do an extremely good job of acting the part of badass witty uk gangsters (as all of Guy Ritchie's characters seem to be). So yeah if you like these movies, you will like this one. It's not the best, it's not the worst, but it is good and bad for the same reasons that all of his movies are good and bad. You will laugh. You will cringe. You will wince.

Cinematography is great too. Guy Ritchie makes this a quintessential English movie...I think!....Not being an Anglophile or someone hasn't even spent time there....except for a 2 day stint on my way to Paris....who knew that such a bad word in the USA (cu***) could be used so often as a comedic and dramatic situations in a movie! Great movie.....It feels Quentin Tarantinoisc , but in a totally unique way that may become a Gut Ritchie signature in the future if he pursues it further...and I hope he does!!! I think Guy Ritchie has proven himself as a top tier director with this movie.

There were a few moments where one minute I thought something had happened and then the next minute they were saying it didn't happen like that it happened like this instead.

Then the performances of the actors are extraordinary-all of them. It's a feast of performances. Matthew is a golden star tailored for this role, Michelle a delight as his 'Queen', in a role so different from Downton Abbey. Charlie Hunnam magnetic to watch as Matthew's loyal right hand man. Colin F. As the 'Coach' is so perfectly funny and tough at the same time. Hugh Grant was a big surprise as the story teller, a sleazy reporter, plotter and script writer wanna be. After so many rom coms, he plays this role with such zest perfectly. I can't do justice, so I'll just stop here.",

Not that I admire his esthetic but -- one must acknowledge the craftsmanship that went into this production.Derivative and poignantly, self-immitative. Had this been a wholly original concept it must be seen as a full blown 10. ( well-a point off for cinematic license where technical compromises seems to have favored a nice image ). And I don't really care that parts came from elsewhere. Right off the bat I was working at deriving what original classic rock and pop tunes were 'morphed' into new-ish works for the soundtrack.Respect is due when you consider that a terrific movie was crafted by reworking pieces from many other puzzles in several genres and mediums.In the not too distant future almost no one will read the way we do today and this WILL be a Classic that informs classes of students in story writing.",

With a strong line up of great acting talent that have been in numerous other great films I had high hopes and it started well.With much of the film told through the narration between Charlie Hunnam's (Raymond) and Hugh Grant's (Fletcher) characters helped the film flowed at a good pace and helped piece it together well. Fletcher was hilarious and made the film for me.In fairness most of the characters were great and it had an exciting mix. There were also many great and memorable scenes throughout that aided a good overall story.However, as enjoyable as it was throughout the ending was somewhat of a disappointment. Not because it was lacklustre or rushed, but because it was so overdone. There were numerous twist and turns and a slightly disturbing scene on a farm which were way over the top that by the end I'd slight lost track and wondered what had happened by the end.Overall if you are a Guy Ritchie fan like myself you will enjoy this film a lot, just might be a tad disappointed with the ending.",

Reading hyped reviews even makes me to have a bitter view on the movie.It is good maybe after an exhausting day, or when you want to watch something that does not make you think. You just want to see glance, or how Mr. Ritchie depict the crime society. But still boring.However it was good to see Hugh Grant in another perspective and in my view the movie had potential.

Sir Hugh Grant is by far the best and only funny character of the movie thanks to his narration skills, his filmmaking references and his gay jokes to Charlie Hunham.\nIt's cute but not sexy.

However, the movie stumbles a bit in its first act. Dialogue comes at you with rapid-fire speed, which can get overwhelming and requires an adjustment period.

The film was very meta and aware, but it was handled with class and not obnoxious. It also fit the story and character, having Hugh Grant's char aspiring to be a filmmaker.Everything was utilized, setup well, and there were fire and great consequences to each action. Pacing was brilliant and the structure was beautiful. Going back and forth between the action and Charlie and Hugh's char scenes at the house were perfect. And right when it would have overstayed it's welcome, we move on to the next part of the story.",

I lost count the amount of times they said the 'C' word and yes I know it is such a bad word and the worse kind of language anywhere in the world (don't hate us) yet Londoners use it a lot in daily life that we don't bat an eyelid when it's said out loud. It was pure genius of Guy Ritchie to use it in the script as it's offensive!!(My only gripe is Rosalind was wearing Louboutin's in a scene and then turns round to leave and the soles of her shoes are clearly not red - that's bad continuity!)",

Sometimes you feel like their dialogues are used only to extend the running time.Plot twists like farm raid leading back to Michael, or the Aslan being the son of Russian oligarch were somehow dull.That throw up scene caught me off guard. It doesn't fit the film and should have been left in Director's Cut.Good things: the setting is great, English underworld image is what always impressed me in Ritchie's movies.

While the script lacks the depth, twists and sub plots of his previous successful forays into the crime genre namely Lock Stock and Snatch. Richie, does have a way of getting performances of note from his cast member's. The aforementioned title certainly delivers again for the director in this respect. While Mcconnaughy delivers with the unmistakable charisma we have come to expect from him, it was the particularly interesting and unfamiliar role of Hugh Grant that caught the eye and highlighted a type of variety not often seen in the work of Grant. Another notable mention must go to Colin Farrell who presents as a sharp and quick witted character prone to a criminal venture. For all the criticism of Farrell and his perceived lack of range, this character and script play to his strengths and showcase his underrated skills as a comic actor. To summarise, this film is by no means a Richie masterpiece and does have a sense of predictability. What it lacks in substance and grit, it makes up for in a wit and it's free flowing pace. Best enjoyed with limited expectations and a less than serious approach!",

The pretentiousness of the film dripped with Ritchie's self-importance that the story and movie itself didn't deserve. This movie took itself more seriously than anything he'd made since Snatch, yet it didn't do anything to earn that distinct honor bestowed on it. However, in the second half it seemed to shed the entitled demands to be taken seriously and just let loose in a rather enjoyable, silly gangster flick. Still, nothing spectacular as it was still a self-indulgent style over substance mess at times with dialogue so contrived only the best actors could power their way through leaving behind the lesser actors to wallow in the melodrama of it all. But I'll be damned if I wasn't entertained by the film enough to give it a 7/10 and give it the distinction of being Ritchie's 4th best film. However, he'd only made 3 good films before this so I'm not sure that that means much.",

Since we start late, let's start coeval: The Gentlemen.The Gentlemen is the 12th feature film directed by Guy Ritchie, who beside penning the last two films of the Sherlock Holmes franchise virtually singlehandedly developed his own personal subgenre, namely the Italian Job (Peter Collinson, 1969)/Get Carter (Mike Hodges, 1971) spinoff mockney comedy caper thriller, which he inaugurated back in 1998 with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, reaching in The Gentlemen its till now baroquest peak.The unimaginatively titled The Gentlemen tells the unsummarizable unimaginative irresistible story of dope (as in cannabis, didn't know such a kind still existed) mega-dealer Mickey Pearson's (Mathew McConaughey) attempts to sell the business and leave the Life, unleashing intricate manoeuvres implicating the Jewish and Chinese mobs, and also brit toffs as sort of stationary mules (you have to see it to understand it), told mostly in a series of flash backs by private eye turned wannabe hustler Fletcher (Hugh Grant gone gay, stellar) to Pearson's right hand man Raymond (Charlie Hunnam) in the course of what has to be the most convoluted attempt at a shakedown in film history.Critical reception has been mixed, and the film can be said to be self-indulgent, self-referential, vapid and/or mercenary, but who in the name of rhyming slang cares? The Gentlemen is not a guilty pleasure, for the enormous pleasure does away with the guilt long before the first reel is through (films don't come in 10 minute reels anymore, and they haven't for decades, I know, I just like to write like this). The script is so jam-packed with one-liners I am seriously considering starting an online petition to have it published in book form (already seen a couple of hints in this direction in online chatrooms). Oh and there's Colin Farrell giving Hugh Grant a run for his money for best performance as MMA coach Coach (that\u00b4s not a typo, it\u00b4s what he is called). And also a soundtrack the 20th Century Englishness of which stands, if memory serves, unmatched, including inter alia Roxy Music's 1973 In 'Every Dream Home a Heartache' and the Jam's 'That's Entertainment', to name but two tracks I hadn't listened to in decades but recognized instantly (although it did take my brain some 20 seconds to reset from the delusion that the latter track was by XTC).So I can't wait for the sequel, titillating insinuations to which were included in the current effort, and would dear to suggest Guy Richie commits his formidable dialogue-writing talent to the script, commissions directing to Shane Meadows and casts Michael Caine and the Kemp bros.",

            "content": "Not always is going forward a necessary improvement.\nThis is proved by Guy Ritchie's latest movie, The Gentlemen, a brilliant coming back of the British director, after the detours from his original imprint and trade mark represented by Aladdin (2019), King Arthur (2017) and in a way also The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (2015), as well as the diptych of Sherlock Holmes, to his origins, those that brought him success and a distinctive narrative and filmic style centered around the London criminal underworld.\nNobody really believes that the British criminal gangs medley so gracefully cruelty and greed with the irresistibly cool, debonair attitude that denote Guy Ritchie's characters, but it is honestly pleasant to find them again on the screen, it is a like meeting after a long time a distant relative, a bit dissolute but in the end loved and, to a certain extent, even secretly envied without admitting it.The American Mickey Pearson, well played by Matthew McConaughey, crossed the Atlantic to study at Oxford but soon became a drug kingpin, aptly able to benefit from his contacts with the needy British aristocracy to build a commercial empire for the illegal production and distribution of marijuana on a national scale.\nMidway upon the journey of his criminal life and happily married to true cockney Rosalinde, he decides to transit to legality and offers to sell all his activities to Jewish entrepreneur Matthew, constantly body-guarded by former Mossad agents.\nThis decision sparks a far-reaching series of effects and subplots that bring onboard various secondary characters, amongst whom Colin Farrell steals the show, that are craftily kept together for the viewers by Fletcher, an investigative journalist working for a tabloid which chief editor holds a grudge against Pearson. Fletcher intends to monetise through blackmail the information he has collected, and those he has only guessed to fill the gaps of what he still doesn't know, and contacts Pearson's top man, Raymond, excellently played by a Charlie Hunnam much more at ease here than as King Arthur. Hugh Grant as Fletcher is in sterling form here, lending an unusual and idiosyncratic charm to a role that deviates, and we should say thankfully and eventually, from the expected characters he has built his successful career on.Mixing his trademark brisk and sparkling dialogues, Tarantino-like yet unmistakably made in Ritchie, with a crafted and expected British-ness of costumes and settings and a pleasant, defining yet not intrusive soundtrack, The Gentlemen is, to put it simply, a very good movie that gives the viewers what is expected of Guy Ritchie, sprinkling cinephile quotes (Coppola's The Conversation, old film reels) and well-integrated self-quotes (Snatch's pigs and poster of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. amongst others) on an excellent camerawork servicing a tight narrative pace whose thread, mainly for Fletcher's catchy story-telling, is never lost during the film and until its, partially unexpected, ending.A step back, but towards the quality if his directorial origins, for Guy Ritchie, The Gentlemen will not be remembered for its innovations but it is a solid, well-written, directed and acted, genre movie.\nNowadays, not too bad!",

Same with the leads. Same with the supporting.For me, it wasn't very predictable... I mean you knew because it's Ritchie that SOMETHING was going to happen but I try to watch movies in a null mind state. I try to not guess and not figure it out so I can enjoy the director's and the writer's intention as it's meant to be. Sometimes it's hard to do.But watching this movie was like eating a giant bowl of kids cereal.

            "content": "January tends to be the Hollywood dump month for movies. All the big players are released in November and December, so when a movie like this comes along, I have to be a little bit skeptical about it. Fortunately, The Gentlemen packs a hard punch, and is a very entertaining movie.For fans of other Guy Ritchie films, like \"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\" and \"Snatch,\" then you should enjoy this one. The pacing is lightning fast, and there is a lot of information thrown at you during the 113 minute run time, but the movie flows so well, that it worked for me. Guy Ritchie wrote all the characters really well, and the witty dialogue reminded me of one of my favorites from last year, \"Knives Out.\" The way the story is told is quite unique, and the twists and fake outs used were quite entertaining, not everything may be exactly what we see. The story is written well, and every detail works together and well layered with many different moving parts that kept me on the edge of seat the entire time.The movie wastes no time getting started. It opens up on what looks like the inevitable, but then takes us back and shows everything leading up to that point. A lot of substance in the first act may lead to some confusion and maybe a little bit of a headache with all the information thrown at the audience. The second act slows down a little as the characters have already been solidified and I was able to catch my breath a little bit before the final act, which is incredible. Everything had a purpose and led up to a great finish.Perhaps the best part of this movie would have to be the acting. McConaughey puts forth one of his best performances in a while, and even with how great he was, he wasn't even the best part. Charlie Hunnam plays the right-hand man, and is one of the coolest characters I've seen in a movie for a while, his presence is powerful when on screen. The biggest highlight however would have to be Hugh Grant, the accent is great, and he delivers a hilarious and clever performance, very different than I've known him for.I would highly recommend checking out \"The Gentlemen\" for an extremely fun movie, and it might be hard to find new movie to top this one for a while. It may not be quite as violent as I was expecting, but what is there is insane and hilarious at times. A great film if you like complex storylines with witty and humerous dialogue. The Gentleman is the first great film of 2020 and I encourage you to check it out!",

One of the things that made me like those movies so much is how unpredictable they were. For example, you never knew what character could die on a scene or how he could die, and there were lots of surprises because of that. Plus, even tho some characters were clearly supposed to be more unlikable than others, none of these movies had a clear villain or antagonist, they just got into trouble with each other. Well, all of that is gone in \"The Gentleman\". First of all its not that hard to see that Matthew McConaughey's character, Michael (who i wanted to get whacked so bad) was supposed to be \"the hero\" and whoever was going against him was made the clear villain. So it became so predictable and formulaic compared to other Guy Ritchie movies. I knew from the start that Michael was never going to die no matter how much they tried to make it seem like that. Plus, his character was one of those characters where nothing could stop him or even put him in a bad situation, he just easily beats up his rivals and it became so, sooooo boring, when in reality, this character would easily get killed by another gangster. Also, the racial slurs especially against chinese people is so excessive and not funny at all in this movie, just felt very tasteless. The only good thing i really liked about the movie was the Coach and his crew, but they can't save this from being a mess and a disappointment.",

Add to that the fact that I dislike mobster films intensely I find myself very surprised to say I loved this movie. Every actor in the film was perfect for their role. I could not recognize Hugh Grant and had to look up who was playing his role. It was the antithesis of a Hugh Grant part and he played it perfectly. The only character who fell into a stereotype was McConaughey and I did not mind that because really the part fit him so well. Normally he rubs me the wrong way but that did not happen in this movie. Colin Farrell was another surprise but again in a very good way. Michelle Dockery is a actress who makes you believe she can eliminate you with a look.

By the way, some jokes go beyond what is generally considered permissible in today 's civilized world. And if tolerance is your middle name, think twice whether to watch this movie, cause it may innervate.Humor is what makes all the main characters nice. And there 's not just one or two of them here. I counted seven, and I probably forgot someone. Of course, everything revolves around one line, but every hero has his own time. The only character I didn't 't like was not funny and came to not good (not good at all). And also, heroes look so real, with familiar human soft spots. Soft spot for a wife, for money, for a child, for power... I think every viewer will find a character with whom he can associate himself.I liked Ray and Coach the most. At first glance they both are clumsy, kind-hearted goofs. In fact, they are fast and intelligent warriors who are deeply committed to a sense of duty. Even though they understand the duty in a very special way.I also was in the aisles because of the sassy, Machiavellian, resilient hero of Hugh Grant, who can creep into any hole without a soap and wriggle out of most unfavorable situation.Now about the dynamics of the film. At first, the plot develops slowly. But then it begins to spins, and at the very end, I barely could follow changes. Two hours flew for me unnoticed, although usually, I feel exhausted wathich even an hour without a break. Apparently, I constantly had to think intensely to trace the plot. I was ready to watch it a second time right after the movie.The trailer, IMHO, does not reflect, how much this film is cool, at least for 10%. It is a secret for me, why. Perhaps creators were afraid to make a bad break, which will destroy viewers' tension. From the trailer, I could only understand I'll see a beautiful picture and much of action. Likely, Guy Ritchie, due to his reputation, can afford such a vague trailer - viewers will come anyway. Love at first sight is not a usual thing for me, but this movie definitely fell into this category.10 of 10.P.S. We were at cinema with Mom, she liked it a lot, too.",

I hadn't watched any of Guy Ritchie's films prior to this - but being aware of his trademark directing style, I can understand how this film had connected with fans of Ritchie's work - many defining this as a return to his form after a few disappointments.Hence, the following review is simply a biased account of my viewing experience, and not intended to comment on the merit of the film itself.It took me a lot of patience to get through the first half, which spent its time establishing the players of the story and the intricate plot. After a while, I kept the film playing in the background, listening to it while solving a puzzle or doing some other pastime. The second half is where the film picked up, the point where the current ongoing plot connects with the hooking prologue of the film.The tone is the traditional trademark style of Guy Ritchie - which prioritizes style over substance. The style here being the cockney-accent heavy cussing, violence and contrived twists and turns in the plot. The substance - depth in character, theme explored, etc. - are all things I personally look for in a film, and I must admit I came looking for it in the wrong film. My bad.The highlight of this film are the performances and chemistry between the actors, especially Matthew McConaughey - playing the suave leader who keeps his cool until triggered, Charlie Hunnam (the dependable and resourceful right-hand man), Colin Ferrell (the foil characters who comes across the primary players and cooperates with them to be on their good side), and finally Hugh Grant (the unreliable narrator and a weasel who sides with the highest bidder).The 'twists-and-turns' nature is most prominent at the climax, which can have a polarizing effect on the audiences - depending on whether its ending feels satisfying to the audiences. I personally wasn't satisfied - given how little I connected with the characters in the first place.I can conclude that I'm not the intended audience for this film. I do like the gangster-thriller genre, but this one failed to resonate for me. However, I'm sure the target audience will have a great time watching \"The Gentlemen\", and I rate this film 7/10 out of respect for the filmmakers and their hard-work on this.",

My only negative would be the over use of the C word, which doesn't fly well with a N American audience but plainly was overly gratuitous regardless. I personally felt Matthew McConaughey was miscast, however out of all the people I know who watched the film they all disagree with me, so, maybe I'm wrong. Guy Ritchie is a genius, the detail to costume is impeccable too, Fletchers' dark glasses were the perfect detail! 10 out of 10!",

Beyond that I couldn't get past how poorly characterized all the characters were. Nobody stood out as having a unique personality. No chemistry between McCounaghey and Dockery. Jeremy Strong was abysmal in his role, every line delivered with a weird, Lovitzian attempt at humor. It felt like he was reading the script as a mockery.

The film wasn't the best and that's not Ritchies fault as such, I believe that this is down to the restrictions from Disney. The Gentlemen was the opposite, it's obvious that he had a lot of fun directing this film and it's Guy Ritchie back in the crime genre! What more can you want!The first act especially before Colin Farrell's character (Coach) is very slow paced and once Coach comes in, the pace picks up a hell of a lot. The plot is about Hugh Grant's character (Fletcher) is \"black mailing\" Ray and Mickey (played but Charlie Hunnam and Matthew McConaughey respectively) as Fletcher is an investigative reporter for a large tabloid paper. Mickey runs a secretive weed empire in England and Ray is his calm and collective assistant, Fletcher finds out how it is ran and is attempting to get \u00a320 million from them to stop the story from running. Meanwhile Mickey is trying to sell and get of out the game, he shows one of his weed growing sites to a potential buyer (Matthew played by Jeremy Strong). Matthew is trying to get the whole empire on the cheap and tells wannabe gangster to steal the weed and make the asking price lowered.That is the plot, it's straight forward but it's Guy Ritchie, you need to pay attention throughout, especially early on! Each character adds a lot to the film and there isn't too much forced exposition as the film is played out in one night with cut backs to what Fletcher says what he has found out. Charlie Hunnam plays a very calm and intelligent assistant with a small amount of humour which he plays very well and it's obvious that Ritchie likes to works with him since King Arthur and I'm looking forward to what Hunnam brings in the future and hopefully with Ritchie too.There is a lot of humour which mainly comes from Fletcher (Hugh Grant) who is almost unrecognisable from his usual roles but does so so well, he plays this role without a fault. His accent is flawless throughout! Mickey (McConaughey) is similar to Hunnam's character being calm most of the time, respectful and intelligent but there are points where he loses his temper and has to get his hands dirty and McConaughey has it in him, he is intimidating and threatening and doesn't even need to lift a finger. Farrell (Coach) does very well, he adds some more humour to the film and plays the character very well as a man with experience but has morales and you can tell he almost hates the new sort of gangster (like all the gangsters in this film).Overall, the film is a class act! The casting was flawless and the way the film was played out adds a real rewatch ability to this film. I feel like everyone put the film down before it come out because it was on the January premiere list but this is honestly one of the best crime films I've seen in a while, maybe even rivals crime films like The Departed. There is a lot of camera sequences like the car crash is so nice to watch, the video edits on the fights and impressive and relevant to what people would do nowadays too! This film will become a classic crime film which will hold up for years to come, I feel especially in England as it's more relatable.",

He's a wonderful actor but this sets him apart as being more than just a great looking lad with tallent.\nHugh Grant, who has really fallen off the popularity list of A level actors, makes this a personal calling card to say \"I'm still here and I'm GREAT\"!

Hugh Grant and Charlie Hunnam lead an excellent acting performance supported by McConaughey and Jeremy Strong.Third act had some introductory elements that felt shoehorned and the meta element of this being a screenplay wasn't necessary. I know the movie was trying to add something else to make it stand out from another gangster movie but that wasn't it.Still really enjoyable, acting was great, will watch again.",

One of Ritchie strengths is that he doesn't hold back on the side characters. Even the non key players are well rounded and intruiging.What let's this movie down, in one word, is Grant. I disagree with other comments. His performance is not inspired nor spot on. It is 'East end gangster character 101'.Growing a goatee and saying a few naughty words doth not a convincing East End character make and adopting a stereotypical effeminate lisp and making a few risqu\u00e9 bottom jokes doth not a convincing homosrxual character make. Grant assumes both.A shame as his role is pivotal. Had it been played differently then the film could well have been recieved differently.",

Every interesting scene leads directly into a new plot that catches your eye and keeps you engaged with the overall story.McConaughey is fantastic especially in his ending monologue, but the stand-out roles here are Charlie Hunnam as Raymond, Hugh Grant as Fletcher. And, let's don't forget Colin Farrell as the Coach who may have one of the best character establishing scenes ever.Hunnam is the scene-stealer though. I wasn't a huge fan of the Sons of Anarchy series, but I did watch a season or two. What's crazy to me are the people who loved Hunnam from Sons, but haven't seen this movie. The chase scene in the middle of the second act is perfect. The \"Shimmy Shimmy Ya\" song always gets stuck in my head and makes this sequence almost impossible to escape my mind.The trailer for this movie made it seem to be another quick cash grab movie with not a lot of heart, but that is not the case at all.Please check this out if you haven't already seen it, and put it on the shelf next to all your favorite proper gangster flicks.",

The acting is top Notch, especially Collin Farrow, Hugh Grant and Michelle Dockery. Matthew Mcconaughey is Matthew Mcconaughey like in the Lincoln commercials. This movie ,like Snatch, is memorable and very re-watchable. Its not as sharp and politically incorrect like Snatch was, but I believe that this is done on purpose to reflect the times and is actually a theme in the movie between Millennial Drug dealers and Gen-X Drug dealers and to me its quite comical. Apparently the politically correct Critic scores do not like it. Its a Great movie its a classic you will enjoy it.",

Honestly, this movie is proof why you should never, ever rely on critics as they're worse paid actors than anything you'd find in even the worst movies.The Gentlemen is quite frankly pure entertainment and a rare glimpse at how engaging good storytelling and convincing acting can be.In short, it is a slow burning half 'who-dunnit' half 'is-anyone-gonna-do-it?' flick in the typical prose of Guy Ritchie. The only thing I wish to add, having seen all of Guy's films is that he has well and truly come into his own here. Whilst so many directors, like Tarantino just re-use the same gags and tricks for shock value, Mr. Ritchie has proven that he isn't an old dog that can't learn new tricks and that he hasn't been asleep during the cultural shift of the last decade.The Gentlemen is a fantastic fusion of modern Britain, technology, culture (if you can call it that at this stage haha) and old school die-hard gangster/mobster vibes.There isn't a single weak performance, so you'll have yourself laughing and gasping so often that you'll need to pause and rewind this great flick. We don't deserve actors like Matthew Mcconaughey and love him or hate him but Colin Farrel does one hell of a role in this film so it's time to get off his back for that Telephone movie he did over a decade ago.Just watch this movie and stop reading reviews, you could do so much worse. If you don't like this style, then I do kind of pity you and I wish you the best with what-ever Marvel releases in the future.I really hope we get a sequel.",

I desperately wanted him to remove the dark glasses because I could faintly see his eyes, behind them, adding more insecurity to his bravado. Tonal qualities; pace; intonation; timing; diction; enunciation; reaction and colloquial/demographic expression were all there in a completely believable manner.Put to the back of your minds 'Notting Hill; L.

The movie is a swift 2 hours long and easy to follow. When people look for representation in film they look for melanin, genitals and what genitals people are attracted to. I don't mind a movie with that in mind every so often but these have become boxes people seek to check. Instead here you will find riverly between jewish, american, and asian drug dealers. I love a movie that doesn't shy away from using a characters background as a way to insult them. The most creativity is in the writing.There are so many twists but just like a great rollercoaster none of them make you feel sick as the ride goes on.

One line witty 'Landan' Sarcasm is all still there, just with added finesse, you will really love spending time with these guys.\nHowever, Henry Golding doesn't really have much to do but is charming all the same (not doing his Bond chances any harm). Unfortunately it's the Women that suffer, only one good female performance from Michelle Dockery, who always manages to hold her own. Maybe Guy is just a guys' guy and therefore writes better for.. you know ... guys.\nWhere this film really comes to life is when the familiar old school' gentlemen' gangsters cross paths with the younger generation. Bringing the film right in line with the you tube genaration, an amazing\"fight \" scene picks the pace up ten fold.\nThe bewilderment of the old firm when trying to deal with the new is where it's at its most fun\n(especially when it takes a sub machine gun to get a point across). With the only bridge being offered by a never better Colin Farell.\nWe have a film that is set in the \"here and now\" and not in 2002, although unmistakingly a \"Guy Ritchie\" film, it's very different from his original two and definitely worth a trip to the cinema.",

I give it a 6.0. Other than an all-star cast, which did their best given the writing (Colin Farrell, Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam etc.) the movie was such a bore, a sub par buildup of a literal narrator from the very start and if you have seen all of his previous films, a total rehash. Like an absurdly meh attempt at rehashing some Snatch with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels with a Triple-A cast that just..came of so weak. The action scenes were strong but extremely rare in the very short amount of time the movie takes place. Seriously it less then 2 hours long with like, *SPOILER ALERT* 3 action scenes are best that are even remotely interesting. Given movies like John Wick and The Equalizer, hell even The Irishman, this movie is like watching a soap opera..and not the good kind. This felt like a family friendly Snatch but with seriously less focus on actual acting. The entire film was basically a focus on the narrator, this was its largest weakness. The main characters of the entire movie came off as side characters while the narrator, who turns out to be a piece of crap who probably dies in the end *you are left wondering* gets all the screen time. This never happened in Snatch or Lock, Lon and Loaded in which the movie was narrated as it progressed by the main protagonist, it gave sorta of a safe feeling of hope that at least the story with end with him being alive, imprisoned or will continue on but he was a likable main protagonist, there is nothing of the sort in the one here. One is left wondering, why? Why such a boring narrator who is basically a bad guy, snitch and why such lack of real action criminal underworld scenes? This felt like a comedic take on the genre but like, childish given the cast. It is an insult to the actors, The Irishman actually was a real crime genre film, this does not deserve the title of gangster or crime at all. The audience laughed more than anything, it was more of a comedy than a gangster film which I think was the wrong direction.Before it felt like it was an actual crime film with comedic elements tying it all together but it was believable, terrifying and real. This movie came off as confused about which genre it was trying to pull more for. I seriously felt like I watched a Superbad for crime movies spoofing Guy Richie. Like if Guy Richie just spoofed himself with a lame copy/paste. There were some strong scenes, but overall, what a disappointment.\nCould say more but then it would just be comparing it to Snatch and Lock, Stock and it wouldn't be fair to it...because in my opinion fails in every comparison.",

The cast is perfect, the plot and pacing too; I simply love it, and it was just as beautifully good the second and third time as well. My only gripe with it is that I already knew it the following sessions. The characters are as well thought out as in Richie's other movies in the genre, if not even more so this time around, and I was especially delighted to see Colin Farrell as the coach. His odd ball characterization was danged great. Then again it was awesome to follow all of the respective characters in the movie, everyone really brought their absolute A-game. This movie is simply a masterpiece and I can't recommend it enough.Just go see it if you haven't already, it's totally worth the time.",

As I specified in the title, I have seen two Ritchie movies before this one, and I didn't like them both at all: Wrath of Man, which I found really boring and slow, and above all King Arthur, which I consider one of the worst films I have ever seen. So I can say that I had my good reasons not to be totally convinced. But honestly I think I got the wrong movie, because I really loved The Gentlemen.It's a wonderfully structured movie, with a splendid narration and above all fantastic characters (I particularly liked the one of Charlie Hunnam, and here, unlike King Arthur, he shows more than one facial expression). I loved it from start to finish, and when I finished it I swear I even gave a round of applause towards the screen...but in some ways this thing made me nervous.Seeing that Guy Ritchie is capable of making such great movies, it made me angry to see that he also made the two aforementioned movies (and which, as I said, I didn't like at all). But I'm happy that now I know what he's capable of. Good job, Ritchie. I can say I \"made peace\" with you.",

I tried to get the movie everywhere but couldn't but yesterday I saw the movie on Netflix in the country I'm on right now for vacation and immediately decided to watch it. And DAMNNNNNN I was blown away. The movie has no \"slow parts\" in it with every talking scene having some sort of tension to it. The dialogue is well written, it's filmed really nicely, it's got some extremely hilarious scenes in it, the acting is as good as it gets with a godly cast. The movie is perfect. It does have a bit of violence and some scenes could be described as disgusting or disturbing and the language is quite bad at times but nothing out of the ordinary. The movie overall on the other hand is extremely above the ordinary and, if you've got the chance, don't even hesitate to watch it. Trust me you won't regret it.",

I walked into the theatre expecting nothing more than a decent crime movie and instead I left having seen a great one.As far as the technical side of things goes it's pretty great. The movie is shot with personality and it feels like you see a different technique or shot every few minutes. The editing had its own flare as it felt quick but still professional. Besides those things everything else was fine on the technical side of things.When it comes to the screenplay, dialogue, characters, acting, etc; there is a bit more to talk about. As far as characters and the acting goes it was great. The characters were all memorable and fun to watch and were complimented by good performances from all the actors alike.When it comes to the story it could be a bit more fine tuned. There are one or two points where things feel a bit jumbled and the movie starts to shove a bit too much exposition down your throat, and while not enough to ruin the movie it was enough to weigh it down a bit. Fortunately when these exposition dumps happened the style and manner in which the dialogue is delivered still sells it pretty well.And speaking of delivery of dialogue the witting of aforementioned dialogue is good. The lines are witting and funny most of the time and this movie managed to get a few chuckles out of me. Even when there is a weak line the actors deliveries are able to sell it.Overall this movie is a fun crowd pleaser that has a engaging style that has convinced me to check out some of Guy Ritchies other movies, so check it out.",

The moment you take your eyes of the screen you've missed the next plot twist or a really good laugh. Because of the complexity of the story you would have to pay attention constantly. For some this would be a pain but I didn't have any issues with this as I was genuinely entertained by the film enough, to pay full attention the whole time.My only issue with the film is that 'The Gentlemen' is very forgettable. Don't get me wrong, it's a very good movie but it's just so forgettable and blends in amongst many over films of the same genre. I can confidently say however, I would easily recommend 'The Gentlemen' to people that like this style of film and humour. If you're after a confusing but intriguing story filled with a mix of characters, violence and a lot of swearing, this film is definitely for you.Viewed on Netflix\n27/2/22.",

Whilst a completely different vibe and story, it maintains the style of story telling which I love most in Guy Richie movies - strong characters with great introductions and development that eventually all tie into the same event.Awesome cast, brilliant characters and some hilarious moments pretty much summing up British culture. I was particularly impressed with Hugh Grant who nails the sleazy reporter perfectly. I never thought I would say this about Hugh Grant in any movie but I think he is my favourite part!",

Depicting gangs has never been about an attempt to \"moralise\", but instead a way of complicating and presenting racial / class dynamics in an ambiguous way. These are not supposed to be heroes and villains, and it's frankly odd and misplaced of Ritchie to suggest that \"loving your wife\" and \"hating junkies\" are enough to redeem gang violence and countless other abhorrent acts.\nThe Gentleman's insistent fetish for a \"nostalgic past\" led to an unpalatable amount of racial slurs and derogatory terms that were just cringeworthy. We get it, free speech man.\nNonetheless, I enjoyed Hugh Grant's frame narrative a lot which prodded necessary fun at these structures. Also really enjoyed Colin Farrell, which again complicated the rigidity of these outdated structures.\n5/10.",

All the actors are strong, do a great job, and have solid chemistry together. Lots of cussing and killing so not for the faint of heart. And don't pick it if your looking for ac actual, full out, comedy. Some of the big name actors play out side of their usual roles.

I dare say that 'Gentlemen', due to such an intricate plot, can alienate a certain part of the audience. But, I definitely liked it, and here are a couple more moments, in addition to the plot, that make this movie high-quality and highly appreciated.I would like to characterize the film with such adverbs as 'beautiful and stylish'. Immediately the question: 'The film is about a drug lord. What's beautiful here, where's the style?' I answer. Actors' dialogues, action scenes, detailed shots, and, of course, costumes and images in general - all this looks exactly 'beautiful and stylish'. Each external image of the hero is the embodiment of British aesthetics. The characters are pleasant to look at and interesting to listen to - the dialogues in the film are witty and sarcastic.Well, how not to say about the great merit of the cast, they perfectly embodied the images on the screen, although it was not worth expecting anything else, because these people have long proven their professionalism.And, another point is humor, which is woven into this picture like a red thread, and makes it more lively and ironic than it could be without it.",

In addition to that, the unlinear use of time catches the audiences attention and offers different insights into the lifes of the characters and their development throughout the story.The excellent combination of drama, thriller and comedy makes you experience the entire spectrum of emotions in a manner that pulls you into another world.Its serious topics, as for example drug use, addiction, and corruption, are presented to the viewer from different points of view. Once you add just a tiny bit of drama and a tasteful amount of dark humor you end up with a masterpiece that is barely comparable to any other movie.This is exactly what cinema is supposed to be and most definitely one of my all-time favorites.

I also own Snatch, and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. That being said, the movie was an empty suit, a hollow shell. It was completely void of the humor one comes to expect from Guy Ritchie or the convoluted intersecting plot lines that come together in the end. The femme fatale had zero sex appeal. Zero fun. I realize this is anecdotal evidence, but people walked out. As a fly on the wall, in the restroom taking a leak, the sentiment was similar. Not sure how it is 8.1. The masses know very little. I'm already making allowances for one of the two most trite, formulaic genres, the gangster flick. I'm reminded of Sickboy's pearl of wisdom in Trainspotting. The first one, as I don't recognize the abortion of a sequel. \"It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life. What do you mean? Well, at one time you've got it, then you lose it and it's gone forever. All walks of life..... \" All I'm trying to do Mark, is to help you understand that The Name Of The Rose is merely a blip in an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory.\" Guy Ritchie also shits on Coppola's masterpiece, The Conversation. An original idea which illustrates the paramount importance of intonation. Nearly 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. Leave it out mate.",

Repeating the lines to your friends. That kind of brilliance.If you loved Lock Stock or Snatch, go see it. If you can't afford to see it, watch it at a friend's. If you don't have any friends, use your imagination!This movie was good enough to stop me reminding myself not to move so much during a showing. I wanted to stay for more \"what it finished, oh no!\" I hope you get as much enjoyment as I did.If you don't like swearing, violence or drug related films, do not watch this!",

The story was impressive - I love something different. It would have been much less so without the right actors. They nailed the casting. Even the diva (Roz) would have been so much less interesting in the part if she was any better looking (although it took watching it a second time for me to figure this out). GOOD FLICK.

Go and watch this in the theatre! An excellent 2 hours.",

Now to the bad, having an 18 rating could of made this movie a 10/10 if it was used correctly. If you are going to make an 18 rated british ganster movie, you need to add the correct level of violence. There was hardly any. It's as if the continuous use of the c word was in hope to make up for what was clearly a budgeting issue. This movie clearly used up too much of it's budget on the actors leaving not enough needed to make full use of having an 18 rating.I would not recommend watching this in a cinema and wasting the money on what you are made to believe is an action packed British gangster/comedy. The lack of needed violence lets the film as a whole down.",

After seeing the trailer, I was more than convinced that this film was him returning to his genre with grace and that I had to see this in theatres. Was able to catch it on the last day it was showing in my country.First off, the script is pure Ritchie. And by that, I mean that the characters do not hesitate to use their expletives but Mr Ritchie uses them perfectly and comically. The entire cast does justice to their characters and it's hard to take your eyes off any of them, especially Colin Farrell as Coach and Hugh Grant as Fletcher, my God these guys can act! The people who think that this movie is homophobic, racist and sexist either think that criminals are all polite and tolerant people or that people in real-life don't actually talk like this. If so, they need to stay away from these kinds of movies because it's not for them. All in all, great movie, would watch it again in theatres if I could!Just two major drawbacks I have to the film: 1) the sub-plot with Pearson being asked to find Laura felt like it was straight out of Matthew Vaughn's Layer Cake, another movie I love, and 2) The almost-rape scene with Dry Eye and Rosalind Pearson at the film's climax. While I don't normally shy away from such scenes, it just felt a bit gratuitous, especially since Ritchie's brand of violence and gore is meant to be much more comedic. My friends and I were laughing at almost every other instance of violence in the film. It may just be me since I wasn't expecting it, but I felt it was a tad too much.Overall, loved it! Would highly recommend it!!!",

As with the aforementioned titles casting was key, and wow were the right choices made for this title. For me personally,the choosing of Matthew McConaughey was as clever as the choosing of Brad Pitt in 'Snatch'. Before watching I wasnt to sure with the casting but after seeing his performance wow! And having his Hollywood prowess working so well alongside Charlie ' Jax Teller ' Hunnam. As a hard core SOA fan seeing Charlie on screen is always a pleasure, ( and its a good job he wore glasses as without you can see why hes so typecast with Samcro ) and he pulled of the dry sarcastic side amazingly well too. From the story all the way through to the chosen soundtrack....this is a collection of amazing choices and more importantly performances.

It had me hooked immediately so I watched it to the end. Then I googled movies with Matthew Mcconaughey and Henry Golding and only then did I find out the title. Hugh Grant was so good in it, playing against his usual role of affable upper class twit, that I didn't even realize it was him. Nor did I recognize Colin Farrell, who was also superb. So now that I know what it's called, I have watched it in its entirety and enjoyed it just as much again.Great cast, great plot (yes, there really is one, although a lot of it is shown as flashbacks), loads of twists and turns and classic one-liners. Don't understand all the negative reviews on here saying it's boring - maybe you need to be a Brit to understand some of the dialog - but I was thoroughly entertained for the 2 hours.

Full-length cartoons rarely appear on cinema screens, the creators of which did not limit themselves to just one desire to make money. It makes no sense, there is no logic, there is no plot depth at all, but cute cardboard creatures mutter some nonsense from the screen, because the children will like it, they will also want a toy from the accompanying merchandise.Therefore, few expected from the director, who gave the world annoying 'minions', something more. In vain.Klaus - does not fit all of the above, from the word at all.This cartoon has a full-fledged and competent plot, the purpose of which is to show an extremely sincere and, at the same time, tragic story. Christmas story. Yes, there is a standard clich\u00c3\u00a9 of the transformation of a negative character into a positive one, but it is in place, it works 100%. A plus is morality, which will easily reach even the smallest viewer, but isn't that the main thing in cartoons?The picture is also surprising visually. Firstly, it is 2D (why not?), and secondly, the artists have neglected many laws of anatomy, so the characters can have matchstick-thick legs, a head larger than the body, or even be the size of a one-story house. All this looks unusual, however, it works great for the images of the characters in the picture.The musical accompaniment is on top, it conveys the emotional component of many scenes well.Outcome. Klaus is a wonderful Christmas cartoon with a good plot, well-written characters and an unusual visual component that evokes a certain nostalgia for the cartoons of the 90s and zero.

            "content": "A fun night at the movies awaits!\nMickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) is looking to get out of his drug empire, so he's looking to sell it off. What we get, though, is a whole lot of chaos and laughs along the way.Today is January 23rd, so when I went to see this movie I wasn't expecting a good movie. January movies are full of garbage a lot of the time, so I thought this could be next line of filth that Hollywood wanted to give us at this time of year, but this is not what happened.\"The movie was actually GREAT\"Guy Ritchie, the writer and director of the film, is most known for \"Snatch\", which is also a movie that involves a ton of chaos and laughs, and \"The Gentlemen\" is much of the same. If I had to describe this movie in one sentence it would be as follows:\"It's what 'Knives Out' wanted to be.\"\"Knives Out\" came out last year and many people enjoyed it. It was a \"who done it\" film with a ton of self aware comedy and plenty of action but, to me, the comedy didn't quite stick the way Rian Johnson wanted it to, but \"The Gentlemen's\" humor does stick with us in this film. And yes, there is plenty of mystery to go around in the film, which makes the action sequences and the dry British humor that much better.When we think Guy Ritchie, we think of humor but something that might be overlooked is the style of his movies. They are stylistic. It might come as a surprise that dry British humor can also have a sort of artistic style to go with it but it can. From the closeups to the quick cut action shots, Guy Ritchie delivers and he delivers this same style to \"The Gentlemen.\"Is there an acting performance that stands out from this movie? No, I don't think one actor steals the show or carries it. The whole cast does a good job at teaming up to make this a fun, comedic, action filled movie. Though, I will say, Hugh Grant is quite good in his scenes and so is Colin Farrell. Much of the same could be said about Charlie Hunnam, who I'm not the most familiar with.This wasn't your average January movie, and could have definitely been a Summer movie if the studios so wished to do so. If you liked \"Snatch\" you will love this movie a ton, but even if you didn't I would still go for Matthew McConaughey and his easy coolness.\"Alright, alright, alright.\"",

Scenes which would've had a 'shock and awe' effect on the viewer once upon a time - now seem overdone to the point of being ridiculous and farcical.Despite the fact Matthew McConaughey is a highly talented and versatile actor, I just couldn't buy into his portrayal of a cold-blooded, murderous gangster. Once you're arrested playing bongo drums in the nude while high as a kite ... you should really think twice before taking on a role where the very mention of your name strikes fear into the hardest British gangsters and thugs.Mr. Ritchie was once a lean, hungry predator and it had a visceral effect upon his films. Now however, the pendulum has swung in a different direction and the effect it had upon this film is all too apparent.",

Of course it's Guy Ritchie, and thats why we like him, but in this movie it was too much for me. There weren't enough repulsive, raw characters which would've counterbalanced this elegant, high-class underworld.I especially hated the boxer gang with their coach, because normally they could have been these guys (they are unexperienced, just entered this world, poor etc), but what were they wearing? Spotless tweed training clothes....\nIt's absolutely fine for a one time entertainment, because some of the great acting, but for me it's nowhere near as the Snatch.",

These are the real problems of Britain, which is seething in a hodgepodge of cultures and unusual businesses. Against this background, cannabis is very popular - it really is. Young people who commit crimes, and then write videos about it on social networks - are you familiar? That's why these moments are present in Guy Ritchie's film.Using the example of the main character's people, it is shown that even these bandits in the prime of life are already Gentlemen against the background of a rapidly developing society.

The film is also filled with plenty of twists and turns that keep the audience guessing until the very end.The dialogue in \"The Gentlemen\" is sharp and witty, with Ritchie's signature brand of fast-paced banter and clever wordplay. The characters are all unique and well-developed, with each one bringing their own unique flavor to the story.Another standout aspect of the film is the impressive ensemble cast. McConaughey gives a career-best performance as the film's lead, exuding charm and intelligence while also displaying a ruthless streak when necessary. Hunnam and Grant are also excellent in their respective roles, with Grant in particular delivering a memorable and unexpected performance.",

If you are not familiar with this director, his most mainstream film is Robert Downey's Sherlock and the recent Aladdin live action adaptation. In this movie, The Gentlemen, we follow a boss-man who wants out of the drug game..and as in the wild, all other contenders to the throne will see this as weakness and naturally hilarity and mayhem ensue... A simple enough premise, but executed elegantly by the man who brought us Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels; Snatch and RocknRolla.Excellent casting all around particularly with Matthew McConaughey as protagonist. Hugh Grant was probably the standout, haven't seen him in a while. He plays a shrewd blackmailer who serves as our unreliable narrator. I just feel like we're missing a certain Mark Strong in this movie...but we got a Jeremy Strong so I guess that'll do..heheheThe violence is sparse but effective. This isn't really a shoot em up. And as with any Guy Ritchie film, you have to pay attention to the multiple plot threads and nuances in dialogue or you'll get lost fast.I'm always fascinated with his British Crime films as this doesn't really translate well in the usual American setting that we as an audience is familiar with. Guns are banned in the UK so that dynamic greatly impacts how the criminal underground works in this story.8/10.",

Having spent years building his powerful empire, Mickey has gone from an ordinary courier to one of the most prominent businessmen, who, on the one hand, enters the apartments of hereditary British aristocrats, but on the other hand, he cannot fully enjoy his status, because his earnings continue to be illegal. The thirst for violence, the destruction of competitors, the expansion of spheres of influence no longer worries Mickey as before, and therefore he made a strong-willed decision to leave the game, selling his vast empire into the hands of a person who is able to shell out the necessary amount of money and not become an obsessive, sticky nuisance. . And it seems that Mickey has very good options for retiring, enjoying a quiet life in the company of an adored woman, but in his particular situation, going into the shadows is not at all so easy. If you have chosen a criminal path, then getting off it is by no means easy. Especially when you have power and connections worth a fortune in your hands. And although Mickey tries to be two steps ahead of his enemies and even companions, he will never get out of the swirling alteration without the goodwill of changeable luck.The Gentlemen combines all the best that we have seen in the most iconic works of Guy Ritchie. Slowly placing the accents of his story, introducing us to a scattering of colorful characters and not forgetting to pay tribute to street gangs, as the basis of all British crime, the director builds a fascinating plot labyrinth, in which, traditionally, until the very end there will be secret passages, roads leading to the abyss and unexpected outcomes, forcing a fresh look to evaluate everything that happened before. It seems that we have already seen all this in Richie's past works, but The Gentlemen still know how to surprise and entertain well. Of course, they are no longer as comical and parodic as Big Jackpot, they have much more drama and serious elements that make you seriously worry about the outcome of all events, but at the same time, the picture looks at ease, captivating you into the story with your head. But in order to fully experience all the charm of Richie's idea, it's worth delving into the plot from the first minutes and not being distracted once again, because there are really a lot of different details and heroes, there are simply no extra characters, and if you omit something, then in general the impression of views may not be as enthusiastic. So getting acquainted with The Gentlemen should be done only when you expect to watch the film thoughtfully and carefully, enjoying an interesting story, excellent humor and acting, which have become one of the fundamental pillars of history along with the script and directing.Matthew McConaughey has proven time and time again that he is one of the best actors of his generation and knows what to do when a director needs more than blindly following a script. Playing the role of Mickey, McConaughey demonstrates steely restraint, and at the same time he is really capable of killing, there is no doubt about it. Mickey is an extremely dangerous hero, he is capable of terrible things, but he is also not without a code of honor. Of course, the image turned out to be slightly idealized, but this is the universe of Guy Ritchie films, in which, despite all the surprises, there are unbreakable rules. The half-comical duo of Charlie Hunnam and Hugh Grant turned out to be unexpectedly funny, who diluted the drama with their dialogues, and the atypical, caricatured Colin Farrell supplemented Richie's ironic mood with his appearance, becoming one of those unpredictable figures that twisted the spring of intrigue to the extent that the finale remains only applaud. And it seems that yes, something like this has already happened, but with the \"Gentlemen\" it's like for the first time.In the end, I want to say that Guy Ritchie is in excellent creative shape and it is clear that he enjoys his work. And we have a good time with him.",

I really enjoyed Charlie Hunnam in this as well as Hugh Grant, though I'm not often a Hugh Grant fan, he did an amazing job in this. The accents were a bit different and threw me off a bit as I wasn't expecting them to be so different from their usual but that just shows great acting, I guess.Love the fight rap, what a crew and the banter between the characters was pretty on point too.

I don't enjoy many films, but The Gentleman feels is next level.With so many mediocre films to watch it's not often one comes along, stands out, and makes a place in my heart like The Gentleman.I loved the cast, the story and the pace of the film. As others have said I didn't even click 'that' was Hugh grant, so good to see him in a role such as this one.It's one of those films where every scene stands relevance and value. Yes it's a modern day film and it's potentially difference to expectations but with it brings so much British film art delivered so expertly by the amazing actors cast in the film. I know I could watch it again and again. I'm not the sort to like films with excessive mindless violence/gore/shootings etc, the gentleman isn't much of these, however being a British 'gangster' film you expect a little and for me it was right on par with that and almost every other aspect of the film.It's not too long either, some films just keep going and you get to a point where you expect them to finish, The Gentleman is the perfect length and every scene is crammed full of action, cunning and fun.",

Take Matthew McConaughey - inimitable in any role. In this picture, he played the main bad guy. After McConaughey managed to break out of the romcom, this is the first film in such an image. And it is played 100%. Hugh Grant took a completely unusual role, which surprised the viewer. Handsome and a heartbreaker? No! A scoundrel in the slimiest sense of the word.Richie tells the story of how Mickey Pearson is trying to end his 'career' in the criminal world. While several characters try to leave him with nothing. The film suddenly begins, flows violently and ends with clarity after all the worries and vanities. They did not miss the love line, although here it was atypical. The beautiful Michelle Dockery added peppercorn in a cheeky way. Mickey Pearson's wife, strong and domineering, turns into a cat (albeit wild) next to Matthew McConaughey's lion. It was interesting to follow their love, although the plot paid almost no attention to the couple. I want to quote dialogues, and copy images. The contrasting images of Hannam and Farrell were especially sunk in.Of course, the film does not have a deep meaning. Or maybe it's just not on the surface. But the film gives emotions, drive, aesthetic and intellectual pleasure. What else do you need? Moreover, I have already reviewed the film twice and intend to do it again. Besides, no matter who I watched it with, all my friends just like me 'went'.A typical crime story mixed with humor and romance, hyperbolized and flavored with jargon. That's what I like!",

Experienced moviegoers will easily figure out some of the plot twists, and everyone will laugh at the shameful opening scene. It feels absolutely superfluous, like a rap clip, inappropriately pasted into the narrative. The events in the film are developing smartly, the characters with their various accents replace each other in the frame with enviable regularity, and you don't even need to count on at least an average number of action scenes. The whole action is here in the dialogues. Violence is minimalistic, but there is a lot of profanity. Offensive to women (the word cunt is very often pronounced) and minorities (goes to Asians, Jews and a little black). And all this is wrapped in a stylish picture with a cheerful and interesting soundtrack.\"Gentlemen\" is Guy Ritchie's long-awaited return to the crime genre, which can be safely called successful.

One of the heroes of the film seriously wrote a whole script based on the events he saw. In fact, we only see 10% of the feed in real time. Everything else is a kind of imagination game of the participants of the dialogue. Some sudden and interesting turns are built on this, when the characters themselves admit that they simply invented some scenes.Nevertheless, there is a story in the film - a story rich in events, twisted and cunningly intertwined. All in the spirit of the good old Guy Ritchie. From this point of view, cinema is an ideological (and stylistic) continuation of his debut works \"Cards, money, two barrels\" and \"Big Jackpot\". And \"Gentlemen\" turned out so well that now it's even impossible to say clearly which of these three films is the best.The story, despite its versatility, is still not based on sudden plot twists (and there are plenty of them here), but on the heroes. The characters of the film, again in the spirit of classic Richie, are worked out to the smallest detail. Each of them is colorful, unusual in its own way, with its own unique details and character traits. Everyone is remembered without exception. And the coolest characters are those who seem to appear only in a few scenes. Strength and coolness in details - these \"Gentlemen\" are very captivating.There is also a diverse set of statements in the film, which seem to cut through the main issues of the generation. Guy Ritchie walked, it seems, on all the most relevant topics of the present day: from racism and social inequality to the legalization of drugs. The topic of cultural differences between the USA and the UK is separately disclosed. Richie is good because his reasoning on these topics does not get out of the general rhythm and style of the tape. The dialogue about racism will be as dynamic and sharp as a gang fight or a swashbuckling chase.The visual side of the tape deserves special praise. The costumes in the film are perfectly matched. The clothes also emphasize the colorfulness of the characters. Each of them has his own unique style not only in behavior, but also in appearance. The camerawork is impeccable and diverse. In the tape, there is also the staging of scenes familiar to a wide audience, and clip editing, and even shooting from GoPro cameras. The meticulousness of the approach is also visible in working with color and light.Summing up all of the above, we can draw an obvious conclusion - Guy Ritchie has returned to the roots. And he returned brilliantly. The director finally got the opportunity to do something of his own again, without adjusting to the direction of studio bosses. Here we have the original Richie again - the one we fell in love with twenty years ago. At the same time, the director is noticeably progressing and in his new work does not slip into self-repetition. \"Gentlemen\" does not copy any of Richie's previous films and is quite a self-sufficient and original work.",

            "content": "The new film will definitely be an outlet for those who fell in love with Richie precisely for the crime, vivid images of bandits and intricate plots. This is the \"return to the roots\" that we have been waiting for. Although it is still necessary to take into account the fact that \"Gentlemen\" is no longer being shot by a young aspiring director, prone to enthusiasm and experiments, but by a solid master.But for the most part, it only went to the plus. Richie is not trying to repeat the success of the first films, he shows that even the world of crime itself has changed, where now everything has become more solid and measured. And therefore, the whole action, although it will surprise you with a sudden turn in the first frames, will be a little calmer, leaving room for beautiful filming and just witty dialogues.In fact, the whole film is a direct speech - Fletcher's story about his guesses, moreover, served in the style of \"Get a shorty\". This approach allows Richie to simultaneously shoot a crime comedy and partially deconstruct the genre itself. Since most of what is happening is one big flashback, and even from an unreliable narrator, in a couple of scenes, the action is literally \"unwound\", showing the difference between rumors and reality, ironic about the ability to lip-read conversations, or even completely complement the action with inscriptions on the screen.",

I didn't see Aladdin, but he was kind of successful. But that's just his part! It's pure and likable Guy Ritchie, with timeline cuts, jumps and characters you'd think only he could write.It's so great to see Matthew McConaughey join our ranks, I think he will replace Jason Statham. But also Hugh Grant's involvement... role/character. Genius! Who could do it and he kills him (no pun intended). At least a few turns will be easy to spot, but I don't think you can guess everything. However, the movie is so well done that it won't really matter. If you like this genre then this is the one to watch. Fun and exciting until the very end...",

Scolded by everyone (but my favorite) and generally recognized as the weakest (before the release of The Gentlemen) crime thriller Rock and Roller, the main claim to which was the creative auto-repeat, surpasses The Gentlemen in all respects. But it is worth paying tribute to the director for the courage to return to the roots, and for the fact that despite the unconvincing comeback, the new work is one of the few entertaining films worthy of attention in recent times. Moreover, thanks to films like The Gentlemen, when comparing, you often come across the phrase 'in the style of Guy Ritchie', and this must be earned.",

The film is fun, intriguing and entertaining. The concept of the almanac is far from new, but it will never be beaten if you have a good script on hand. The picture grabs the viewer's attention. And not only because of the very intriguing plot, but also because of the colorful characters. Driven crime thriller with great humor. The film has a powerful atmosphere, an interesting story and unrealistically cool, colorful characters with different sets of qualities that set them apart. This is accompanied by great action sequences and good acting. Even with such a hackneyed concept, you can make a great final product that is sure to please fans of the genre.",

            "content": "A talented Oxford graduate, using his unique mind and unprecedented audacity, came up with an illegal enrichment scheme using the estates of the impoverished English aristocracy. However, when he decides to sell his business to an influential clan of US billionaires, no less charming but tough gentlemen stand in his way. An exchange of pleasantries is planned, which definitely will not do without shootings and a couple of accidents.So, it happened: the British 'talent' Guy Ritchie returned 'to his roots' (as if the previous picture of the British - 'Aladdin' and a couple of paintings in front of it - there was some kind of 'misunderstanding', which I want to forget a little), and understand that the true Guy Ritchie is back 'in a big way'. The plot in the film is multifaceted (and I don't want to particularly 'spoiler'), but the film itself - to use a phrase from the film itself - is still a 'grease tale': the whole film is a 'borderline conversation' between private detective Fletcher and one of Mickey Pearson's assistants - Raymond Smith, who, over glasses of whiskey and barbecue, are discussing the affairs of recently past days: showdowns of some heroes with others, when one and the second are building a 'deal', and the third and fourth are trying to break it and take the 'jackpot' for themselves. Here, on the estates of the impoverished English aristocracy, marijuana is grown, a gang of young 'bouncers' in tracksuits with a pattern of 'English tweed' terrorize everyone in the district, the Chinese mafia is on the alert, and one of the editors of the local 'tabloid' is forced to rape a pig. 'Gentlemen' is a return to 'roots' after 20 years. It's got a great cast that tries to 'outplay' each other, and who immediately caught the 'essence'. This film is an explosive mixture of drive, impudence, youth and the belief that by doing the most vile deeds, the main characters remain gentlemen.",

But behind the secondness lies the same Guy Ritchie from the 2000s, who, with his hyper-realistic model of narration, is able to lure any viewer. Therefore, I warmly recommend this picture for viewing, and I hope it will give you pleasure.",

Now I want tracksuits in which the guys dance there)The theme of the film is of course hype, relevant, on which the script was built. Personally, I was pleased with the plot twists and want to continue. As a result, I watched this movie with my boyfriend, he also got it, but my friend tried twice and nothing came of it, she fell asleep. I don't think everyone will understand this movie.

            "review_title": "Slow Burning",
            "content": "For me, Guy Ritchie's films, coarse as they might seem at first glimpse, always prove to have certain subtle value like that of some fine vintage vine; the more times you watch them, the more you can savour his 'liquorish assortment' of dialogues, which are witty and streetwise as hell at the same time.This one is possibly the most refined of his movies in terms of story-telling and character distillation, however, the thing which I really came to appreciate is how corpulent, as wine connaisseurs say, this picture is; the first time I saw it, I was left there with not much to remember, only a hint of it being just worthy enough not to have it erased from my hard drive and some sort of languish for the now-classic raw savagery of Snitch or Two Smoking Barrels. The second or third time, freed from focusing on the story, I could indulge way better in having some serious har-de-har; rotfling around about the comical situations and the pedigree performance of the cast. Finally, several viewings later, I found myself more and more coming to the conclusion that, as protagonist Mickey Pearson puts it, 'I like middle age' and everything that goes with it.In this sense, I feel there is quite some bell-ringing analogy when comparing Quentin Tarantino's early classic Pulp Fiction with the not as fancy but certainly more elaborate Jackie Brown. The same kind of refinery process is evident when looking at Ritchie's Snatch and The Gentlemen. While the first is all fracas and guffawing tomfoolery, this latter is more about grey matter and placid smiles. The only difference is that while Quentin merely took 3 years to complete this kind of ripening (just in order to get back to his rough-hewn roots with Kill Bill later on), Ritchie's incubation period was 19 years.All in all, one could say this one is slow-burning; 'rings the bell but not too loud, dipped in honey, it's on the money.'Glad to see that this gentleman can still make a good cup of tea.",

The acting is alright, mostly all well-known actors, most of them have worked with Guy Ritchie in the past and are mostly known for gangster-inspired films.

The acting was done very well and very quick. As for the writing and directing, the quick jumping around through the story can be off-putting or odd on the first watch. However, after watching it a second time, I found it much easier to follow. The film is decent fun if you watch it once. However, I have found the more I watch it, the better it becomes.

For example, it's unusual to see Hugh Grant playing such tricky character but he made me believe that he almost acts the same in real life. So when you're watching this movie you can immerse yourself into a different world.\nThere are many jokes and funny moments in this movie. I can say that I laughed a lot!

This did get a bit confusing at parts mainly the beginning due to the onslaught of information that does start to make more sense as the film goes on but I was able to follow it all none the less. The characters are all very well written and very different to eachother which helps with keeping the audience interested and not getting bored of the movie and I appreciate the subtle humour in scenes to keep people entertained. That's not to say that the overall plot didn't keep me hooked, I can only compare the narration to that of a third person picture book. There is not much description of the scenes from the narration but that isn't required when you are spoon fed the satisfactory visuals and visual storytelling that the movie puts across. One thing I didn't enjoy too much was the overdramatisation of some people, specifically in the terms of the unrealistic way people communicate with eachother and the stereotypical British way of talking and language, this is only some though and the overall generalisation of cast is very well. Each actor does absolutely amazing in their role especially Charlie Hunnam as Raymond Smith, Colin Farrell as Coach and Hugh Grant as Fletcher, that's not to say that the rest of the cast do not do truly incredible in their part. The character of Fletcher is a true stand out and does perfectly as the narrator of this movie and the narration really put this movie together for me and I personally found his and Raymond's part of the story the most enjoying",

It feels like a gangster-meets-weed movie. Matthew McConaughey is incredible in this film. Michelle Dockery is my favorite interpretation of an empowered and confident businesswoman. Their pairing is perfect. Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant, and Colin Farrell are each amazing in their respective roles. Every actor brought their A-game for this movie and it shows. I can only hope others enjoy this movie as much as I do. 9.5/10",

I mean, say what you want, but it would have been easy for him to coast doing the same kind of film every time. He didn't though, he branched out with the \"Sherlock Holmes\" films, \"King Arthur,\" and \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" Now, let's be honest some of those didn't work. Still though, it took stones to risk his career. *********************************************************************************************************************************This film is a return to form for Ritchie. There are some casting issues, but the story is as solid as \"Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,\" \"Rock'N'Rolla,\" or \"Snatch.\" The only fault the film has is it's casting. We all know I'm talking about the \"alright, alright, alright\" \"Magic Mike\" man himself Matthew McConaughey. It's not that he's a bad actor, but just that he doesn't fit in the film. He stands out in every scene. One could only imagine that he was a studio choice. Apparently, he can't do a British accent. It really feels like they rewrote the film to accommodate this fact. On the flipside thought Colin Farrell delivers another low key genius performance. The rest of the cast is just as flawless. ******************************************************************************************************************************What really shines is the writing. Ritchie and Co. are in rare form. This is a screenplay tighter than a nun's box. Sorry, I just watched the film and the dialogue is so infectious it's rubbed off on me. The plot is just as well crafted. Guy Ritchie is also a genius when it comes to instant character development. He really is a writer that makes great story telling look effortless. I do acknowledge that he didn't write it alone, but how many rings did Jordan get before people realized that he carried everything he touched? Guy Ritchie is a great story teller, it's no secret, and this film is just another feather in his cap.",

The rest of the star-studded cast did really well too. The movie was fun and had a lot of twists, but it should've ended earlier than it did.

Overall 3 stars is generous, it is not due to acting or directing it is because it is something I would turn on in the background for some noise while doing odd tasks around the house but will never again sit down and watch from start to finish.",

Check it, most scenes are just this.\nThe plot is a mess, the dialogue trying to be clever but it's bullshit and not even funny, I laughed twice.

Watching the characters navigate their dealings with a colorful vulgar vernacular in a world of up and coming thugs while trying to maintain a sense of respectability is highly comical, but there is something relatable to the characters trying to maintain equilibrium in both their chaotic circumstances and their goals.

Does this London gangster caper work in 2020 like it did in 1998? \n\nYes. But times have changed. Firstly the production is alot more developed. Secondly, times have changed. East end geezers don't really hang around pubs and markets anymore, do they? Everything is gentrified. People shop on Amamzon. Recording devices in everybody's pockets make crime difficult, and there is reference to this in the movie. This means that the movie is a little less raw and limits what Ritchie can get away.\n\nThat said it is nice to watch an old style movie and enjoy some loveable rouges up to no good. Hugh Grant is very adept as an East End low life journalist mixing with\nthe wrong crowd. Matthew McConaughey brings some Hollywood to the movie and faces off against Succession's Jeremy Strong. Apparently Strong is a very committed method actor which all of the other people on set (McConaughey included) find really annoying. Colin Farrell makes an amusing appearance and the only let down is by Charlie Humman (I spent half the movie trying to work out where he was from).\n\nRitchie made his name with Lock Stock and 2 smoking barrels and then went on to make Snatch.

The story feels unique and fresh, and the comedy is gutbustingly hilarious, though it can be offensive to some at parts. Really the only complaint that I have is that sometimes the plot and story tends to become so absurd to the point where it either doesn't make sense or it is quite literally impossible for most to follow.

My judgement is that this movie has a cool look and an interesting idea, but I lost track thanks to Guy Ritchie\u2019s non-linear plot. I like movies that make you think, but not like this.

Lots of twists and turns and the perspectives of the characters aren't actually clear until almost the very end.  I really don't know if anyone but Guy Ritchie could do this and I'm not a Guy Ritchie fan.  I found the second Holmes, Game of Shadows, to be just a little too oblique to know what was going on and too hackneyed, grey, \"chatty\", and bleak to care.\n\nMichelle Dockery is brilliantly out of typecast as a sexy, acerbic yet soft and feminine, love of the main character's life.  She is submissive to him while powerful, competent, and fearless at the same time and her role is critical to the plot.  She's definitely out of any \"Downton\" curse.\n\nMatthew McConaughey, who I've suffered through his \"too cool\" in other roles, plays this perfectly believable.\n\nColin Farrell and Hugh Grant are also completely out of any typecast.  Farrell brings so many new dimensions to this character that you really lose sight of who he is.  Same with Grant who is so gritty and slimy you can't imagine him in a rom-com.\n\nKudos to Ritchie for finding these characters in these actors and weaving them into the story\n\nI'm not sure why Rex Reed hates Ritchie so much, but it seems to be emotional.  In the film, there's an exchange between the main character, a truly productive man, and gossip rag editor, who creates nothing, rather leeches off others' creations with vile printer word.  The leech is rebuffed by the main character, rather than shown respect.  Throughout the film, the leech is portrayed as a pathetic weasel brilliantly woven into the script.  I, obviously, don't know this for sure, but frequently art imitates life and the subtext of this film may very well be an expression of Ritchie's perspective on Reed.  Yet it's critical to plot and not obvious until I read Reed's review of this film.\n\nI certainly see the similarities and I only just became aware of Reed's excessive derision of Ritchie as \"an incompetent director\" while Reed is really incapable of creating anything of substance and leeches off the products of others.  Would Reed be turning tricks on Highland if nobody made movies?  Maybe. \n\nThis movie is a mental challenge with plenty if action and dark humor as the story unfolds.  It's one of those classics worth a rewatch",

Headlined by an Allstar cast that includes Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Henry Golding, Colin Farrell, Michelle Dockery, and Hugh Grant, this film delivers on so many levels. Not as good as some of his most revered works, The Gentlemen is more focused on the characters in the film. Everyone in the movie is well casted and all the performers deliver their characters amazingly. They all seem to be having fun with their respective characters, which is great to see. The intricate web of deceit and shady business is delicately woven as the film goes on. The story is narrated for the majority of the film in almost a meta way by Hugh Grant's character. We get to witness how things go about in the underworld of the UK, and how things go to crazy shit in a comedic way help give the film the energy that it delivers. All the loose ends connect in such a great way that you will feel satisfied as the movie approaches its climax. It's a scoundrel, foul mouthed, fun yet well placed film. It might not be for everybody, but if you're a fan of Ritchie's previous works, and if you're a fan of dark humour, this is the film for you!",

Yet, it feels as refreshing as it is stale.\n\nThe large ensemble of actors, though playing extremely well off each other and are clearly having fun doing some really quircky cold-blooded brits, are unnecessarily expensive, and I think Ritchie internal reasoning was something along the lines of:\n\n>\n\nThe action is spectacle-ridden and the plotting is sometimes fairly intelligent, even devilish, and Ritchie made sure that we know how much he loves cinema, which was kind of endearing, I have to admit, but ultimately, The Gentlemen don't have the authentic, yet theatrical swagger of the cast of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.

The other suitor ends up being Henry Golding as Dry Eye who gets his way using force and bribery.  This Guy Ritchie movie was a breath of fresh air much like Lock Stock but this one was a bit more up to the times. The story was retold by Hugh Grant looking to sell his script to the highest bidder and he was very mischievous and backstabbing son of a bitch but it was one of his better performances. Charlie Hunnam acts as Pearson's conciliatory contact specialist who always had his back as well as Colin Farrell who is one of Guy's favorite actors to work with.

The storyline for the most part is good and delivers some genuine laughs. My only slight issue with it is the ending, or, for a better term the sheer amount of them.

Speaking of a Tarantino flick, this movie also has some longer scenes, which is good. It's got it's humour, it's entertaining and it's also elevated by a great cast. Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant, Henry Golding and Collin Farrel are all terrific! Overall,The Gentlemen is a very good crime/comedy and a future classic.

I like Ritchie's usual dark humor, though wish there was more of it & the characters were slightly more shallow - compared to his usual (if not in comparison to his 1st films).  Would have liked to see more depth, if not 'investment' in the main characters, as even McCaunaghy's more than suitable persona seemed to fall a bit flat overall.  Agree with some other reviewers that said Colin Farrell should have been an even more integral part in the film, with a more developed character... but I am also guessing that there may be a purpose behind that (which may just play out in an inevitable sequel).  Despite some lag, it was a classic example of what comprise a signature Ritchie film - which some people may not quite grasp the twists and turns from the very start or be repulsed by the use of language (classic Ritchie) and violence - which was actually quite tame comparatively.   As far as I'm concerned, it was as enjoyable as every other one of his films, but at this stage of the game for Ritchie - had hoped it would've felt a little more seasoned.  With the door left wide open for a sequel, I do hope that the characters might be a little more developed than they were presented here - maybe with more detailed backstories. Would like to feel more invested in them vs a mere glossing over (as they were here).  Love Charlie Hunnam, and the use of Hugh in this role was fantastic - a great scumbag, does he make!",

The film is so stuffed that it's hard to build up a particular affinity for any character, but McConaughey performs adequately and Grant just melts into his wonderfully weaselly role.

Fletcher offers to sell his findings (typed up as a screenplay entitled Bush) to Pearson's right-hand man, Raymond Smith (Charlie Hunnam), for \u00a320 M. Born in poverty in the US, Pearson won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University, where he began selling marijuana to fellow students before dropping out and building his criminal empire by violence. He now plans to sell his business to American billionaire Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong) for $400 M so he can retire peacefully with his wife, Rosalind (Michelle Dockery). Pearson shows Berger one of the labs where he grows his cannabis under the estates of aristocratic landlords, who need cash for the upkeep of their stately homes. Pearson is later approached by Dry Eye (Henry Golding ), an underboss for Chinese gangster Lord George. Dry Eye offers to buy out Pearson's business, but he refuses. Pearson's lab is then raided by amateur MMA fighters and aspiring YouTubers \"The Toddlers\" who overpower the lab's guards, steal a van-load of marijuana and upload a rap video of their caper online. The fighters' trainer, known only as Coach (Colin Farrell), orders them to delete the video and is horrified when he discovers that the cannabis belongs to Pearson...\n\nRotten Tomatoes consensus reads, \"It may not win writer-director Guy Ritchie many new converts, but for those already attuned to the filmmaker's brash wavelength, The Gentlemen stands tall.\" Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Leah Greenblatt rated the film a \"B-\" and found it to come up short when compared to Ritchie's previous crime films, stating, \"The Gentlemen is nothing if not a callback to the Locks of yesteryear, star-stacked and defibrillated with enough juice to jolt a gorilla out of cardiac arrest.\" Some reviews perceived the film as anti-Semitic, racist, homophobic and sexist on account of its portrayals of characters that fit stereotypes. The Independent described it as \"an equal opportunity offender\" in its targeting of a multitude of minorities from Jews to East-Asians.\n\nWith \"The Gentlemen\" Guy Ritchie is back at what he does best to be honest (and with that I do mean the two great Sherlock Holmes films he has made as well). This is a classic Ritchie gangster movie with witty dialogue, a great ensemble cast, over the top violence and a storyline with plots within the plot. And you gotta love Colin Farrell\u00b4s Coach if anything. \"The Gentlemen\" is solid entertainment and if you liked \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\", \"Snatch\" and \"RocknRolla\" you will like this one as well.",

There were rarely any dull moments since all the characters were so fun and colourful, especially when the movie begins to add in elements of blackmail, bribery, deceit, and violence. However, the movie stumbles a bit in its first act. Dialogue comes at you with rapid-fire speed, which can get overwhelming and requires an adjustment period. (But that's most Guy Ritchie crime movies.) You just feel like you're already behind and need to catch up. Once you're adjusted to the narrative style and the movie settles in, everything comes together in an awesome final act.\n\nOverall: Great\nRecommended for: Fans of Guy Ritchie films, fans of colourful performances with witty dialogue, or fans of saying Phuc hundreds of times until you get it right. Phuc. Phuc. Phuc.",

Coach (Played by Collin Farrell) was my favorite character in the whole movie, Ray (played by Charlie Hunnam) was amazing, Fletcher (played by Hugh Grant) was also amazing, the charisma of each character is the thing that really saved the long conversations or maybe the whole movie, to be honest, and without it, these conversations would've been boring as hell and the movie was gonna be dead.\n\nReally loved the production design that really suited the environment and the characters, also the custom designs were pretty cool and fancy exactly like they should be. \n\nNow for Mickey Pearson (Played by Matthew McConaughey ), I wish if we could have seen him more in the movie, felt like he didn't have much of a role or something, he was just the \"BOSS\" that has his guys to do everything for him and to be honest it makes sense he's the guy who built the highly profitable marijuana empire so of course, he's just gonna have his guys do everything for him, they even call him \"BOSS\" the whole movie, but I still wanted to see more of Mickey Pearson or to be specific, I wanted to see more of Matthew McConaughey. \n\nAlthough all the characters in the movie were \"BAD CHARACTERS\", we still really loved them that's a thing that I loved about the movie. \nFelt like there were some characters that weren't even important in the whole movie or they didn't have much impact in the story and one of them is: Dry Eye (Played by Henry Golding), although his acting was okay, his character was a waste of time.\n\nThe Gentlemen is a very funny and interesting movie, filled with a bit of action that you'll enjoy, really recommend this fun movie.\n\nMy rating is: 7.5/10",

That is where my compliments end. Henry Golding's character was written in such a racist manner. A lot of the dialogue was trying too hard to be deep and witty & ended up sounding corny. So many threads and characters are thrown at you quickly, but I eventually got it all straightened out by 60% through the movie. The overuse of f-bombs and the c-slur is an example of the laziness in this script. Jeremy Strong's acting was weak here. It ends by alluding to a sequel... a sequel?! No, baby, no.

            "content": "This movie is good. It is not great, but it is a solid film. It is about a drug kingpin that is trying to sell his business and all of the back-stabbing that goes along with it. It is interesting to watch, but sometimes it moves at a much slower pace than it should. There is some witty dialogue and the acting is great. There is a feeling of style over substance though which is a bit of a hinderance. There is some dark humor scattered throughout its runtime which livens it up from its oftentime very serious crime world. The movie is told mainly by Hugh Grant's character, Fletcher. He followed this crime story and wrote a screenplay about it and wants to use it as blackmail against the drug lords. He explains in ferevent detail what the story entails, so there is a lot of exposition in this story and a lot of cutting away from seeing the story to watching Fletcher explain what is happening. At the beginning it seemed like a fun little gimmick, but by the mid-way point of the movie it just got a bit annoying. It is kind of like how \"The Princess Bride\" is done but with less charm. Guy Ritchie is fairly known in the directing world for having very stylish movies, like the \"Sherlock Holmes\" movies. This is movie has all the style and slickness we have come to expect from Ritchie, but there is just a lack of connectivity between the story and the audience. However, this movie is fun and will keep you entertained with its several moving pieces. I do think it does a really good job of tying everything together at the end, and I thought its ending was fairly satisfying. The meta-appeal of it being a screenplay is a bit too meta for my taste for this type of movie, but it does add a bit of flare to it. This movie has a lot of vulgar language, and I think it would have benefited if it toned down the profanity a bit. I enjoyed this movie though, and I think it is worth a watch. Overall, I give this movie a 7.5/10.",

            "content": "A raunchy riot for a classy crime saga.\n\nGuy Ritchie sees himself in rare form for his latest crime comedy The Gentlemen (2020). I have to immediately mention that Ritchie's script writing is incredible. He writes an intricate crime narrative with multiple drug lords going at each other's industry, but he shocks you with twists and turns you will not see coming. Guy Ritchie takes his 1990's grit and edge and refines it with contemporary style, references, music, and language for The Gentlemen. I really enjoyed his abundance of English slang that only younger audience members would catch. The Gentlemen is Guy Ritchie going full British director unapologetically and I love that.\n\nHis attention to detail in his written setups is as impressive as James Herbert and Paul Machliss' slick editing that keeps The Gentlemen to a tight 113 minutes. Ritchie writes his heroes and villains as all realistically vile, racist, greedy, violent, selfish, and repulsive monsters in his unique voice. His direction has never been more thoughtful and refined as Ritchie does not waste a shot. Alan Stewart's cinematography is gorgeous with wide shots of sets ornately decorated by Sarah Whittle and styled by Gemma Jackson with a modern production design befitting a Tom Ford film.\n\nChristopher Benstead's score is subtle, then suddenly boisterous and matches The Gentlemen's mature tone. Michael Wilkensen's costumes look like he was dressing actors for a James Bond film. In fact, The Gentlemen is very much James Bond meets Snatch. Guy Ritchie's use of rock, rap, and random other genres is very refreshing to hear in a contemporary film. I'm so glad that Guy Ritchie did not tone down his charming, English style.\n\nThe Gentlemen features a magnificent cast of talented actors and actresses delivering riveting character actor performances. Matthew McConaughey is phenomenal in a unique turn as a methodical, careful drug lord called Mickey Pearson. Instead of the eternal stoner like in The Beach Bum or Dazed and Confused, McConaughey brings menace and leadership as the focal point of The Gentlemen. Charlie Hunnam is the standout of The Gentlemen as McConaughey's right hand man Raymond. He's a far cry from his usual bruiser hothead characters, instead Hunnam plays Raymond as a cautious sidekick with OCD and subtle observant expressions.\n\nHugh Grant has to be mentioned as the sleazy, self-serving reporter Fletcher as his everyman accent is hilarious. His narration is riveting because of how strange and particular Grant goes for in this unusual role that you'll just have to see for yourself. Eddie Marsan has a great supporting role as the insecure media man Big Dave. Chidi Ajufo is great as Charlie Hunnam's henchman Bunny.\n\nHenry Golding sheds his nice guy romantic leading persona as the vicious and violent crime lord Dry Eye. Michelle Dockery is lovely as McConaughey's wife Rosalind with a fun Cockney accent instead of her usual posh accent. Jeremy Strong is funny as Cannabis Kingpin Matthew with his quiet jabs and intense presence. Colin Farrell delivers a killer fighter role as Coach. He's hilarious and caring at once. Farrell is so exciting to see act in dramatic roles and funny in comedic roles. Everyone brought their best for Guy Ritchie and it shows.\n\nIn all, The Gentlemen is a crime film that will age well as it's so technical that you'll always be able to catch something new upon revisiting it.",

I get that he wanted to return to form without making yet another version of Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (both of which I liked, especially the former), but I'm quite not sure whether most of the choices he made here in order to render the film a refreshing feel worked together. Regardless, The Gentlemen is a good fun with enough clever touches to satisfy Ritchie's fans.\n\n(6.5/10)",

The film \ud83c\udf9e is a great throwback to his new old work such as but not limited to (Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, RocknRolla, and Sherlock Holmes). The latter of which I could best describe as Gritty British Crime Dark Comedies as a very particular genre to jolly ole England \ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc65\udb40\udc6e\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc7f and Director Guy Richie. Do I even need to say all the performances are great, the moment I saw the cast list and what kind of movie \ud83c\udf7f this is, I knew everyone was going to be a tone of fun to watch. Especially Hugh Grant, Colin Farrell, and Mathew McConaughey playing up caricatures and having so much fun in their roles. The few things holding it back though is some scenes do feel like they drag on for a while too long, and are not as funny as his previous films. Not to say there weren't any laugh out loud moments there were hilariously dark moments hence the blend of different genres and unlike Knives\ud83d\udd2aOut it has a much more likable charm to it, doesn't feel forced to add in any reference to the current political climate (thank GOD). Editing added funny visuals and transitions between scenes. Along with the cinematography adding visual flair to who the characters and the dynamic between them. Overall while not as his early work like Lock, Stock or Snatch its definitely the best of his more recent work and I hope it does well enough at the box office to allow him to do more projects like this and allow for more creative freedom and I give the movie \ud83c\udfa5 an 8.1/10.",

I give it a thumbs up because of Grant's performance; I appreciated Ritchie's earliest ventures, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and Snatch, much more than this one",

But it's damn boring with an unreliable narrator dictating to the audience the entire plot. It tries to be meta but bores like no other.\n\nSuch a shame because this film had an A+ cast. Matthew McConaughey, Henry Golding, Colin Farrel, Jeremy Strong, Jason Wong, Hugh Grant, etc, etc, etc. The plot contains drug kingpins, Triad gangsters, blackmail, and a power struggle. With such an interesting plot and cast, you'd expect this to be the action movie of the year. But it falls flat on delivery.\n\nAnd the style of the movie feels unfocused at best. The pacing skips from slow to fast to somewhat interesting to less so. It goes from (near) action then to boring narration to where I audibly groaned.\n\n1.5/5. Painful to watch.

Proceed at your own risk, my Dear Readers, as Your Friend and Humble Narrator spins his yarn.   You'll notice I've appropriated some content from something else.  A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. That is intentional, I assure you, the reason for which shall be ultimately revealed to those few who finish this tale.\n\nThis is an excellent movie, with an asterisk.  The asterisk qualifies my feelings about it as you shall see.  Enough dancing; I'm making my move.\n\nThe writing sparkles with wit and nuance in this complex, multi-layered film that somehow feels like THE BIG SHORT, while being nothing like it in story at all.  You'll delight at the British, Irish, and Scottish slang that abounds here.  The clever witticisms and charming local color.  Breaking the fourth wall on a meta-level.  The extensive use of a narrator who weaves a story told as a film plot that delivers most of the exposition.  It all works. \n\nThe acting is first rate, as one would expect.  The filthy and slippery lead character and narrator Fletcher, captured beautifully by Hugh Grant, is an unctuous homosexual blackmailing curr.  The performance is a revelation.  Charlie Hunnam, whom I've never really noticed much before, is also excellent.  If possible, it's Colin Farrell who steals the show from the fine performance of Matthew McConaughey.  These characters swim in personality, each their own.  So, no problem there.\n\nThe story is problematic as it recycles LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS, a fan favorite I find in every way inferior to SNATCH.  Although this film has elements of both, it leans well towards the former.  It's no secret I do not like drug content, which is very much the background here.  Nonetheless, still not the problem.\n\nThe problem is the borrowing and recycling herein.  I suspect there may be legal action in future.  Yes, Ritchie borrows heavily from his own work.  The trademark car crash.  Boxing and fighting.  The pub settings and Houses of Lords.  The Marijuana manufacturing.  Not my thing. Yet, still not the problem. \n\nThis film very obviously \"borrows\" from two things it shouldn't, unless there were arrangements made.  The first is Black Mirror 1:1, my least favorite episode, which grotesquely involves a blackmail plot involving unnatural acts between a man and a pig.  It's very unpleasant, and this film makes it funnier and less onerous by implying more and showing less.  But it's still a direct replay of the shocking 2011 production, if only in passing in one scene.  It's flagrant.  That's a problem.\n\nAlso problematic is the borrowing from SE7EN of the pound of flesh theme of the Sin of Greed scene.  Almost no variation at all.  Once again instantly identifiable and quite flagrant. \n\nFuture legal issues or no, I was very disappointed in these \"borrowings\".  They're essentially verbatim and so obvious that my wife, not a fan of such things, immediately identified both on her own, without help, on first viewing.\n\nYou'll recall the TWELVE MONKEYS lawsuit and theft of the conceptual design of the inquisition chair and inquiring eyeball machine Bruce Willis was subjected to.  The production approached the artist for licensing.  They were given a price, didn't pay it, and used the set piece anyway.  It cost them millions in a resounding negative verdict.  For stealing a set piece for a single scene.  This was more than that. \n\nThese things may not bother most, but they certainly bother me.  An entertaining film with an asterisk for some glaringly obvious problems.  ***. 5/*****.  74/84.",

            "content": "Midway upon the journey of a criminal life.\n\nNot always is going forward a necessary improvement. \nThis is proved by Guy Ritchie's latest movie, The Gentlemen, a brilliant coming back of the British director, after the detours from his original imprint and trade mark represented by Aladdin (2019), King Arthur (2017) and in a way also The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (2015), as well as the diptych of Sherlock Holmes, to his origins, those that brought him success and a distinctive narrative and filmic style centered around the London criminal underworld.\nNobody really believes that the British criminal gangs medley so gracefully cruelty and greed with the irresistibly cool, debonair attitude that denote Guy Ritchie's characters, but it is honestly pleasant to find them again on the screen, it is a like meeting after a long time a distant relative, a bit dissolute but in the end loved and, to a certain extent, even secretly envied without admitting it.\n\nThe American Mickey Pearson, well played by Matthew McConaughey, crossed the Atlantic to study at Oxford but soon became a drug kingpin, aptly able to benefit from his contacts with the needy British aristocracy to build a commercial empire for the illegal production and distribution of marijuana on a national scale.\nMidway upon the journey of his criminal life and happily married to true cockney Rosalinde, he decides to transit to legality and offers to sell all his activities to Jewish entrepreneur Matthew, constantly body-guarded by former Mossad agents.\nThis decision sparks a far-reaching series of effects and subplots that bring onboard various secondary characters, amongst whom Colin Farrell steals the show, that are craftily kept together for the viewers by Fletcher, an investigative journalist working for a tabloid which chief editor holds a grudge against Pearson. Fletcher intends to monetise through blackmail the information he has collected, and those he has only guessed to fill the gaps of what he still doesn't know, and contacts Pearson's top man, Raymond, excellently played by a Charlie Hunnam much more at ease here than as King Arthur. Hugh Grant as Fletcher is in sterling form here, lending an unusual and idiosyncratic charm to a role that deviates, and we should say thankfully and eventually, from the expected characters he has built his successful career on.\n\nMixing his trademark brisk and sparkling dialogues, Tarantino-like yet unmistakably made in Ritchie, with a crafted and expected British-ness of costumes and settings and a pleasant, defining yet not intrusive soundtrack, The Gentlemen is, to put it simply, a very good movie that gives the viewers what is expected of Guy Ritchie, sprinkling cinephile quotes (Coppola's The Conversation, old film reels) and well-integrated self-quotes (Snatch's pigs and poster of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. amongst others) on an excellent camerawork servicing a tight narrative pace whose thread, mainly for Fletcher's catchy story-telling, is never lost during the film and until its, partially unexpected, ending. \n\nA step back,  but towards the quality if his directorial origins, for Guy Ritchie, The Gentlemen will not be remembered for its innovations but it is a solid, well-written, directed and acted, genre movie.\nNowadays, not too bad!",

A couple of unforgettable movies made, seemed very similar in comparison, minus the obvious timeframe and actors(Lock stock and two smoking barrels and Snatch). These two, similar like, movies, if only watched in the order mentioned in the parenthesis, followed the same path. It caused you to almost guess what happened in Snatch. This one, however, had the same grasp on my mind, but, disabled my ability to guess. Completely unique and absolutely enjoyable. The style, slightly different, enabled him to start it off with character you wanted to get to know rather than explaining them off the top. The narrator like, past explained style as it allowed present and future caused you to enjoy the characters as the movie grew. Typically the start of this magnitude would allow you to know them upfront. Not this one. Please watch and enjoy. If you haven't heard or seen of Guy Ritchie. You will want to get to know him after this. Must watch!",

This movie has such a stacked cast and I loved all of the performances. Some of the action scenes are very good and it feels so smooth. The score is surprisingly good and I really liked it.\n\nI really liked the script but it is inconsistent and the script is just such so fun. There are some cliche moments in this movie and it is kinda disappointing. The movie is predictable especially in the later second act and in the third act and I really wish it wasn't predictable. They do flesh out their characters but I wish they fleshed them out some more if they did I would move my rating up more but they didn't.

            "content": "Of box office disappointments, weird decision-making, and general mediocrity, the 2010s were a rough decade for Guy Ritchie\u2014excluding the sweet, sweet Sherlock Homes: A Game of Shadows, that is. I don't know, maybe The Man from U.N.C.L.E. wasn't the worst thing ever. Aladdin wasn't very Ritchie-y, though. And I'll shamefully admit I'm still waiting to see the apparent insanity that is Legend of the Sword. Anyway, Ritchie's back to his mobster movie roots with The Gentlemen, and oy oy, I'm chuffed to say it is as entertaining and stylish as it is faffingly British. Indeed, a jammy return to form for the bloke, biscuits and tea, and all that.\n\nThe Gentlemen follows Matthew McConaughey as Mickey Pearson, an American living a life of excess and splendor in the UK thanks to his enormously successful underground marijuana empire. Though ready to put up the mantle, a smarmy blackmailer and rival criminal plots pop up, threatening to ruin his retirement. While Mickey goes around town finalizing his business settlements, his right-hand man, Raymond (Charlie Hunnam) tails the conspiracies revolving around his boss' friends and enemies.\n\nWith all his coined Texan smoothness mixed with an imposing gangster presence, McConaughey's as great as ever as Mickey, and I especially dug Hunnam's surprisingly pleasant performance as his chivalrous, kindly goon, Raymond. The true lifeblood of the film, Hugh Grant also gets tons to do with an electrically eccentric performance hammed up to eleven, and Collin Farrell squeezes in a neat little supporting part in there as well.\n\nSadly, Michelle Dockery and Henry Golding get screwed by significantly weaker writing. Golding's character is particularly unpleasant with potentially racist undertones that carry through the rest of his sometimes fun, more often off-putting subplot. They're fairly minor roles in the scope of it all, though, and Dockery at least manages to own her role well enough.\n\nBut everything I've written greatly undersells the movie. A unique non-linear framing device unravels the film with sidebars and digressions ripe for Ritchie's flair and comedic pickings, and, as expected, the story explodes with personality at every turn. Do you like rapping, acrobatic martial artist YouTuber gangs? Fancy fancy dudes committing dapper crimes?  Are you just looking for a really good time overall? The Gentlemen's got you covered, baby.",

I've been amused by his outings with Sherlock Holmes and quite enjoyed The Man from U.N.C.L.E., but I wasn't even all that impressed by his fan favourites, like Snatch. For myself, I see that's he's now on a nice little streak. I really enjoyed his live-action remake of Aladdin and I think The Gentlemen may be my favourite film he has ever done. Although it does get a little self-indulgent at times, here's why I believe The Gentlemen may impress you, even though you may need to have an acquired taste for it.\u00a0\n\nThe Gentlemen tells the story of Michael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a man who wishes to sell off his Marijuana empire in order to escape from the crimes he has committed. This leads to a lot of blackmailing and mistakes, which then leads to death and chaos. However, at its core, this film is about Fletcher (Hugh Grant), a man who is trying to make this story into a feature film. This element was probably my favourite portion, as it tied current events into past events, which made for an interesting experience. Sadly, that formula became a little self-indulgent by the final act.\n\nAs I mentioned, Guy Richie, who directed this film, has a very unique style. To get the negative out of the way first, without ruining anything for viewers, there is a scene towards the end of the movie that breaks the fourth wall in ways I haven't seen in a while. That particular scene left a bad taste in my mouth, but I enjoyed the rest of the movie too much to let that be a huge detractor. From his witty/snappy dialogue to his hilarious choices of the way certain characters speak, he has certainly not lost touch with the types of movies he likes to make. For myself, this one just happened to work for me, more than any of his previous original work.\n\nFrom Matthew McConaughey to Charlie Hunnam (who is fantastic in this role), Colin Ferrell to Henry Golding, and the rest of the endless talent, The Gentlemen is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to the talent on-screen. I was actually worried throughout the first 20 to 30 minutes that it felt a little messy and that these actors wouldn't have many ways to shine, but I was wrong. This movie finds its footing by the end of the first act and never lets up. I was thoroughly impressed by the acting, screenplay, and overall editing throughout the film, that my complaints never ruined my enjoyment.\u00a0\n\nIn the end, The Gentlemen isn't a perfect movie and Guy Richie definitely pats himself on the back a little too often this time, but I would be lying if I didn't say I had an absolute blast. The dialogue came a mile-a-minute and it was either important to the story, clever for the sake of being clever, or simply hilarious, and I just ate that aspect up. The quick style of this movie won't be for everyone, but if you happen to enjoy that sort of thing, then you may just love this movie. I like that style when it's done well and it really worked for me here. The Gentlemen is a fun time and I recommend checking it out.",

Unfortunately, it is a weaker vehicle for carrying a tale to the viewer. It takes much greater control of the craft of film making to 'show' us the story and let us come to the conclusions that the storyteller is hoping to lead us to. \nThis is the only weakness in this movie, because of all of its moving parts, the director may have found it the only viable technique to encompass all of the tales convolutions. This tale has many intricate dimensions and so has a lot of ground to cover in its limited time, so its director may have found this way of taking the viewer along for the ride as his only recourse.\nOther than that, this movie's story is good and enjoyable. I found myself glued to it from the hook in the opening. The ensemble cast is superb and the acting is A list quality, so maybe I should have given it four stars, but won't due to the nature of the story being told - it is not a world shaker. It is about a minor league player on the world stage of life's underbelly - the noble savage, if you will. There are many like him in the world whose stock and trade have come of age, the weed industry. His one act of nobility is that his trade doesn't kill people - but his business does. He'll not garner any sympathies or respect from this writer.\nIt's a gangster movie, and a good one, but not an earth-shaking one, just another little man who would be king and does become so, in the end, through rather clever means and by staying one step ahead of the other big fish in this otherwise small English pond. I would recommend it's viewing if you enjoy Scorsese's content without the Scorsese style of 'showing' you the story rather than narrating it to you. \n\nThat's my rating, and I'm sticking to it.",

It's a return to the gangster black comedy that made him famous in the first place, and he relishes in the chance to do it all again. Full of comically over the top dialogue, witty verbal exchanges, bursts of violence and foul-mouthed characters in a variety of attire, its much like a Tarantino film, only not as long-winded. The plot sounds surprisingly complex, but Ritchie keeps things well paced, and as such you are never overwhelmed by the information presented, so its surprisingly easy to digest. It does often tread on ground that Ritchie has covered before, but what keeps you invested are the characters and their banter. Colin Farrell is hilarious as always, Hugh Grant is delightfully slimy, Matthew McConaughey is a lot of fun as the top dog, trying his best to sound convincing with the British wordplay and mostly succeeding. As some have remarked, those who aren't already Ritchie fans will likely be put off by The Gentlemen, whether by its vulgarity and brashness or its offbeat nature, but for his sizeable fanbase, it's another riotous good time that combines savage comedy with even more savage drama.",

It's not groundbreaking and doesn't aim any awards. It's a movie designed to be fun for two hours.\n\nBut then comes the storytelling. It's very Guy Ritchiesque but it has a twist. I'm not gonna spoil it, but it's an interesting and different method to tell a story that has different timelines.\n\nMatthew McConaughey is great as usual.

With one of the most complex screenplays in a while, the phenomenal cast elevates this crime-thriller into one of the best films of 2020, so far. Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant, and Colin Farrell stand out, but every actor delivers excellent performances. Extremely funny and captivating storytelling through Grant's narration, which ironic or not, it's both the best and worst component of the movie. When used in excess, it can be a bit bothersome and lengthy, but for most of the runtime, this alternative to substantial exposition works brilliantly. Interesting characters, intriguing mystery, and hilarious bits of comedy make this feature very entertaining. Technically, great editing keeps a well-paced flow, but it's Ritchie's layered narrative that steals the show.\"",

I would expect someone in their 80s to be mature enough to appreciate and respect the popular work of an artist, even if they don't personally like it.  Disappointing to see such a prominent \"elder\" of the film industry so hateful at such an advanced age.

He's looking to retire and sell his lucrative marijuana empire, but when everybody surrounding him has their own elaborate scheme, this isn't going to be easy.  Now I have always held Guy Ritchie in high regard even though it has been over a full decade since he directed a movie that I liked more than I didn't.  I adore Snatch to the point that I consider it to be in my top 10 movies of all time, so I feel obligated to always give him the benefit of the doubt.  I am very pleased to report that this is the movie I've been wanting from him for years and years.  Now while Matthew McConaughey may be front and center with top billing, I wouldn't call him the star of this.  He is well and good in this, don't get me wrong, but Hugh Grant steals the show in this as this charismatic and salacious private investigator.  He is so cheeky and having fun with the part that whenever he is on screen, you can't wait to hear what he is going to say next.  Everybody in this gives quality performances.  Sure, they're all given that macho tough-guy cockney dialogue which we have come to expect from a Guy Ritchie gangster flick, but everybody is committed to the characters and knows how to land a joke.  In fact, the characters are so well rounded and rich that I feel like it makes up for some of the shortcomings in the story.  The movie utilizes the unreliable narrator technique, usually to comedic effect, but it does sometimes make you work to keep up with various story points.  The forward motion of the plot does get muddled at a number of points, but the dialogue is so well written that I was able to forgive it and look past it.  I don't know if the expectation of not having loved a Guy Ritchie movie in ten years had anything to do with it, but I had a great time with this from start to finish.  It moves fast with well-timed jokes, and nobody phones it in, so there isn't really a weak link.  I would happily watch this again, and 2020 is already shaping up to be one of the strongest starts of the year we've gotten in cinema in quite a long time.  I give The Gentlemen an enthusiastic recommendation.",

Bouncing back and forth between the super-serious world of Matthew McConaughey\u2019s drug dealing, and the goofy story-telling of Hugh Grant was odd. I wasn\u2019t even chuckling all that much in any of the opening scenes, despite amazing performances from all the cast. However, there was a point where the movie turned a corner and I let out my first audible laugh. Somewhere along the way I found the humor in the serious stuff, and I was totally on board with the blend of styles, and the story that continuously bounced around in time. Once the floodgates were open, I was laughing a ton at all the crazy antics. It\u2019s been a long time since I last watched a Guy Ritchie film, so I forgot how he structures his stories, and how he writes comedy. As with most of Ritchie\u2019s early films, the profanity flies fast and loose in The Gentlemen. I can\u2019t say I enjoyed how freely they threw around the four-letter words, but I was desensitized to it after a short time. The film doesn\u2019t quite flow as smoothly as I\u2019d like either, because Ritchie wants to constantly play with non-linear story-telling. There are moments where he will leave out a detail in a scene and, even though we could probably fill in the gap ourselves, he feels the need to bounce back and show it. Unless you\u2019re going to shock the audience with a surprise reveal, this kind of editing is style over substance. However, I loved the fact that most of the movie is told in the format of a movie pitch, and even has mistakes because Hugh Grant\u2019s character doesn\u2019t know all the details. There were so many fun moments in The Gentlemen, and it had laughs to spare. While it pales in comparison to Snatch, it is still an enjoyable time at the movies.",

My wife wanted to see Harley Quinn, but, since it was my turn to pick, we saw this one instead. The film is presented in typical Guy Ritchie style, very interrogative, just barely but not quite breaking the 4th wall. I'm pretty sure Matthew M. has made a career of playing characters like this: a not--quite-legit guy operating outside the law and locking horns with other not-quite-legit guys. Lots of colorful characters pop up as the film progresses. I'm pretty sure Hugh Grant's character is gay--not sure, but I think so. Collin Farrell's eyebrows, and his hideous track suit, ought to have been given a screen credit of their own. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by this slick little crime thriller. Some scenes, like the one in the crackhead's apartment, go on for way to long, and, if I'm counting correctly, the film had not one, not two, but three endings before it finally did end.",

And I didn't think it felt trite or anything, it had a strong identity to it. It felt, to me at least, that it was able to draw very intentionally from a lot of archetypes of British action classics without feeling a cheap copycat. It\u2019s odd to me that a movie like Knives Out, which follows much of the same conventions, is praised for drawing from obvious influences while subverting expectations, but this is panned for it. Maybe it\u2019s just because I went in with low expectations but the writing felt very sharp and intelligent. It was a lot of fun and definitely above average.",

            "content": "Wonderful time watching this one.  It is easy to see why Guy Ritchie doesn't churn them out too often.  His style is unique and brilliantly thought out.  There were several complaints by moviegoers about this movie but honestly I had a great time keeping up and keeping track of the antics, twists and turns.  But to be fair I am a big Guy Ritchie Fan.  \n\nMany people want to see Snatch, Lock/Stock and Sherlock Holmes redone over and over but each of his films are in many ways distinctly their own.  In fact, SyFy has had King Arthur on high rotation and I have watched it a few times this past month. I liked it when I saw it in the theater years ago and I liked it even more now because I was able to pick up nuances that are all Ritchie.  \n\nIn The Gentlemen, YES there is the one over used \"C\" word.  YES it can be tricky to keep up... But that is just it.. Keep up!  \"There is truly only one rule in this jungle. When the lion's hungry... He eats.\"  The actors literally eat up each and every scene.  Even the scene where many viewers complained were too slow or too confusing. It just takes us coming out of our comfort zone to pay attention to what is going on, the back drops, the colors, the clothing, the slickness, the messiness the perfectness of it all to easily find yourself enjoying what is going on.\n\nMathew McConaughey is like a large Burmese Python.  Slowly moving through just about every scene he is in.  Don't be fooled. He is the sun the entire cast orbits around.  It is because we are not sure when or how he might strike and that keeps our eyes on him.  People complain about the Lincoln Car ads and maybe they are cheesy but heck this guy got arrested in his 20's for playing the bongo drums naked while high.  Was probably considered the least likely of all actors to process through a career but he has come a long way and I can appreciate him for that.\n\nCharlie Hunnam is nattily dressed gold and McConaughey's right hand man who maybe doesn't always get it right but he cleans up after himself so he NEVER gets it wrong. Maybe his is Ritchie's good luck charm the way Jude Law was in a Holmes and King Arthur or maybe he is being paid back for King Arthur's poor showing but I loved not see him as Jax Teller from SoA.  I wish he did more movie work.  I think he is under appreciated for what he could do.\n\nColin Farrell is brilliant as a rehabilitator of young, strong lost souls and after so many bad movies it was wonderful to see him used in such a way to remind us of the fact that he is a solid actor and funny to boot.  \n\nHenry Golding is (as always) gorgeous and seemingly a bit neurotic and too big for his britches but he is an antagonist and unfortunately (he doesn't catch the clue) a young male chimp who swings out a bit too far on a vine with no way to grad another for safety.\n\nMichelle Dockery is making the most of her post Downton Abbey fame and while she is not seen overly much throughout the movie Ritchie has given her character heft and importance and one doesn't mess with this lioness.\n\nAs for Hugh Grant.  Yes his character is outsized and YES it is quite a turn for him to be so un Hugh Grant like but he is the one wheeze in this movie that I would have liked to have seen less of.  Maybe it was his annoying nasally whine or that he was on screen way too long but maybe less could have been more.  I am not sure though.  If less would have been more.\n\nJeremy Strong and Eddie Marsan positively drip with muck and slickness.  I have loved Marsan for all his work on Ray Donovan and know he is a versatile actor.  Jeremey Strong has been in so many movies I have seen and never paid attention to him.  I clearly did here and loved his role.\n\nThis is truly an ensemble cast wonderfully woven together to tell a story that may seem hard to understand but if you can get your frame of mind to understand that it is a Guy Ritchie movie and he spins a yarn like no one else you will have a solid and absolutely fun ride with these gentlemen.

I think the change in timeline was necessary for the films full effect, but it seemed like it tried too hard to go back and forth and narrate and add asides, that it just became a little distracting.

Warning: this film is very Richie, and so there are lots of very British monologues and narration, so you might not like if that's not your thing. There are some great call backs to other Richie work, one chaotic chase scene in particular that gave me strong Rocknrolla vibes and Richie's soundtrack doesn't disappoint.

I also noticed the cast matured in age & mellowed: The same way a college student keg stands their alcohol compared to the way an adult sips a tumbler of something aged to perfection. I liked the way the shots were framed and the subtle touches. For instance, in one scene a main character tells some kids to \"sit\". He repeats it with the hand signal you give to a dog. In the background of the kids is a framed picture of a dog. It made me smile. There's more of this through out the movie. I wanted this to be a 5 star movie for me, but the slow pace held it back. I think if they make this into a series of movies with these characters, I may come to appreciate more as an introduction to this world. But for now, it's a respectable 4 stars.",

Extremely pretentious, the only things that work in this movie are the cast (not all of them) and the humor (not all of it), and none of that is enough to overcome the poorly conceived story structure in this lazy throwaway gangster script. I couldn't stand Hugh Grant in this movie his overacting in this just did not work for and he unfortunately is our unreliable narrator, he made it a painful movie to sit through but other other actors in the cast are excellent like Henry Golding, he's playing a very over the top gangster but we have so much fun watching. Eddie Marsden is also a blast in this movie. The Gentleman unfortunately is not one of Guy Ritchies best (although it is extremely well made), hopefully his next gangster film (we know he's never going to stop making these) is a lot better. 5.5/10",

            "content": "\"The American Lion in the English Jungle\"\n\n\tGuy Ritchie returns to both the writing and directing chair to craft an exciting action-filled comedy that only he and he alone could create. \"The Gentlemen\" stars a wide array of talent that perfectly bring Ritchie's patented expressive dialogue to life with every word they utter. The excitement in this film is not solely found in the action and gunshots that were heavily marketed but is instead felt within the elaborate narrative that keeps at a steady pace, along with the eccentric characters that help shepherd it along. Ritchie's style bleeds throughout this film's core from the very opening title credits, to the final cut to black; all of his standard trademarks are here which some may find tiresome, while others will find great enjoyment out of. Nevertheless, it should go without saying that with Ritchie in the driver's seat \"The Gentlemen\" is an immensely entertaining film that will keep audiences engaged in its wonderful world of formalized chaos.\n\t\"The Gentlemen\" centers around the suave Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a kingpin that reigns over his established marijuana empire as he navigates throughout London attempting to remain on top, despite the many adversarial forces he faces along the way (But it is far more complex than that). A private investigator known only as Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is hired by Big Dave (Eddie Marsan), an editor for the Daily Print tabloid with the strict assignment of investigating Pearson's personal ties to a royal named Lord Pressfield (Samuel West). During the course of his investigation, Fletcher uncovers several secrets shrouded in mystery and deception. It is realized, that Pearson is fully intent on selling his business to the American billionaire,  Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong) for a grand sum of $400 million. However, at the exact same time, a young Chinese crime boss named, Dry Eye (Henry Golding) is looking to relieve Pearson of the stress by outright buying the entire establishment. When Pearson refuses, he and his wife Rosalind Pearson (Michelle Dockery) along with his right-hand man Raymond (Charlie Hunnam) are thrust into a world of chaos where they are the primary targets everyone is aimed at. Having said that, it should be noted that the first two-thirds of the film are framed within a late-night conversation Fletcher invites Raymond to, with regards to his findings. Fletcher fully intends on selling his discoveries to Raymond in exchange for \u00a320 million or he will go to print, a simple blackmail technique.\n\tRitchie provides an exhilarating screenplay that keeps audiences glued to their seats guessing where it will go next and just when you think you've figured it out, the film takes a complete detour of absurdity that most would fail in their attempts  The film rarely stops to take a break which on paper may seem like a real flaw; but for \"The Gentlemen\" it is not. The narrative is told by the character of Fletcher and it feels extremely meta, so much so that a poster of one of Ritchie's previous projects can be spotted for keen eyes. This type of narrative structure is a technique that some may find distracting and unfocused, but I personally find it to be brilliant. After the beautiful opening credits, we are instantly thrown into a shocking moment that immediately grabs your attention like a salacious headline; it is hard to forget. With this inciting moment now lodged in our brains, the audience becomes hyper-focused as they watch in awe eagerly waiting for that fatal moment to come back; and when it finally does, it is just as shocking as it was when we first witnessed it. Although this is a method used by many writers and directors, Ritchie pulls it off in a way that does not entirely spoil the film from the offset. With the film's events unfolding through Fletcher's recounting of the situations, as an actual written screenplay titled, \"Bush\" you cannot help but be fully captivated. The constant callbacks to past incidents and shifts of perspective all add to create a story that is one of the most entertaining ones of the year.\n\t\"The Gentlemen\" as I expressed earlier, is a film constructed by an auteur that relishes in a flashy, yet extravagant style that only he could design. From a very entry-level observation, the first thing that will catch anyone's attention are the elaborate and debonair outfits everyone on the cast, dons. Regardless of whether it is a fresh tapered suit, a loose-fitting jacket, or a bold tracksuit, every character showcased on-screen displays a level of sophistication only Guy Ritchie could pull off. Every shoe, every top, every pair of glasses; every single article of clothing appears to have been hand-picked as a means of painting each individual cast member as a figure you will not soon forget. Surprisingly, this quality is not exclusive to only the main cast as many of the extras also have a unique visual flavor that brings more life into every moment. When the film travels from scene to scene, the characters look fantastic, but so is the dialogue they are speaking. Ritchie's use of language is rather impressive as none of his characters are presented as shallow one-trick ponies. Every line of dialogue is pointed with a purpose that perfectly sets the stakes for every scene as all of the actors and actresses are constantly vying to dominate the verbal battles they find themselves in. With metaphors and jokes littered all throughout, it is hard to not find all of the English accents just a bit endearing. Unfortunately, on the flip side, because of how animated the characters and their words can be at times, they will occasionally slip into the territory of a cartoonish caricature of themselves. It is not distinctively a fault of the film that ruins it by any means, but it can be a bit overwhelming from time to time (A sentiment that is true for the entirety of the film).\n\t\"The Gentlemen\" is a blast of a film that explodes with character and features a fabulous cast that all bring their best. From the costumes and sets to the characters and their dialogue, Ritchie's fingerprints are all over this film and it appears as though he is playing in a wheelhouse where he feels the most comfortable. Now of course, if you are not a fan of Guy Ritchie's films or his overabundant style, then \"The Gentlemen\" may not be your cup of tea. However, the story and visual flair used to present it, flows throughout every frame and is certainly something that will entertain from beginning to end. Truly the first must-watch of 2020.\n\nFinal Verdict - B-",

The trailers looked entertaining, this film is populated with a terrific cast, and after seeing the film, I left satisfied with what I saw.\n\nMatthew McConaughey is relentless in this movie and the best I have seen him in a long time. His character was awesome, smooth, and just flat out likable. Every performance in this movie was terrific and totally fit the tone that this movie was going for. There were some very funny sequences and a lot of fun to be had throughout most of the run-time. That being said, there isn't a lot of action like some critics are saying. Like there is action in the movie, but it's not \"action packed\". It was a fun time to be had with a pretty good story once everything comes together. Some of the side characters I thought were going to get annoying at first but they quickly became important to the story and likable. Also, the opening title sequence was honestly fun to look at and the music choice enhanced the scene greatly. For a January that's been a mixed bag for movies, it was pleasant to sit through a movie like this and Bad Boys 3. However I do have some problems with the film.\n\nNow I mentioned that there is a good story in this film and that's totally true, but the way its told was rather confusing at first. Even though the story comes through in the end, it took awhile for me to understand the way this film was telling its story. It began like it was a part of a movie script, but the events were also happening. Also, as good as some acting was for these characters, it doesn't change the fact that most of them were underwritten. Also, one of the villains was very annoying and I didn't really buy him as a villain. \n\nThis movie was a fun time at the movies and a perfectly enjoyable flick especially considering the time in which it came out in being January. Nothing game changing, but Guy Ritchie is definitely in his comfort zone when working on this genre. Hopefully he never does anything like Aladdin again...jokes aside, I'm going to give The Gentlemen, a B",

When things start to come together, and they do soon enough, this movie truly fits the billing as a \"gangster comedy.\"  It's great storytelling, unpredictable, with magnificent acting.  Pro tip:  Take care of your bathroom needs prior to the movie.  There is no \"slow\" part where it is safe to exit the theater even for a moment.  In fact, I cannot recall ANYONE in the entire theater exiting for a short break.  It's that fun and captivating.",

As someone who's clung so unabashedly to the notion that his \"Sherlock Holmes\" films are the best things he's ever done, I was wary of this return to the early days for Ritchie. I don't particularly dislike movies like \"Lock, Stock,\" \"Snatch\" or \"RocknRolla.\" I just find them a bit too showy and brash for my tastes. However, it seems the skills accrued via those jaunts through studio-dom have perhaps melded with the indie sensibilities that were already so present within the man. And the movie's all better for it. Yes, \"The Gentlemen\" is still undeniably Ritchie, but with just the right amount of focus, tact and accessibility to make even the most fervent of Ritchie-deniers leave the theater feeling satisfied. As shocked as I am to say this, I have to admit - I honestly think this is my favorite of the \"proper\" Guy Ritchie gangster flicks.",

Because this movie is engaging, it drives a fast pace story that is changing and taking new turns as each scene begins. There are some interesting and creative techniques used in this movie that don't belong in a \"British Mafia Drama,\" such as that surprising gang music video. This movie surprised me, and I hope it will surprise you. As a young aspiring filmmaker myself, with a few gangster features under my belt, this film gave me callbacks to the drive, ambition, vision and thrill I had when I wrote my own mafia trilogy. I went into this movie expecting it to be bloody decent, because apparently not too many critics appreciated it. It blew me away, and I was very pleased. I don't disagree with professional critics that much, there's only a handful of movies that have been the case. \"The Gentlemen\" is a gritty Guy Ritchie movie, and deserves more appreciation than what some are giving it. Not the best gangster flic out there, but it sure is a damn good one.",

            "content": "\"You really can't unsee it once you've seen it.\" \n\nGuy Ritchie returns to his gangster roots in the underbelly of jolly good England. It's crazy to think that this is the same guy who brought us last years \u2018Aladdin.' But this time Ritchie isn't on a leash.\n\nI honestly didn't expect to enjoy \u2018The Gentleman' as much as I did. A little muddle and sometimes confusing to follow, but the movie has a certain sharpness to it that kept me interested throughout. It's more in vein with \u2018Lock Shock' and \u2018Snatch'. Ritchie has made a successful career being influenced by the work of Quentin Tarantino, hence his given title \"British Tarantino\". \n\nThe cast are all having an absolute blast with the material and I can tell everyone wants to be there. \n\nHugh Grant is my personal favorite out of the cast and it's great to see his enthusiasm in acting again. He plays Fletcher, a gay detective who documents the events in the story into a screenplay he's writing, so in a way it's told from his perspective. While debatable if everything in the movie was made up or not, cause \"every movie needs a bit of action\". The thing I love about Grants performance is that he isn't playing \"typical Hugh Grant\", but an actual character. Although I thought the running gag of him being openly gay and constantly makes flirty hints towards other male characters got old and awkward after awhile. A joke that out stay's it's welcome...kinda like Fletcher.\n\nI'm not a big fan of Charlie Hunnam as an actor, as I usually find him bland in everything I've seen him so far. However I thought Hunnam delivered a solid performance in this movie and might be his best. He plays Ray, Mickey's (McConaughey) right hand man who is professional when it comes to business despite the countless idiots in his path. Imagine Russell Bufalino from \u2018The Irishman', but more physical and incredibly British. His comedic timing was pretty good as well that maybe if you give him the right material and character, he's a better actor than I thought.\n\nColin Farrell was terrific as Coach and my second favorite out of the cast. He's ridiculously cool and shows who's boss, but also display's some comedic chops. Matthew McConaughey was chilled as Mickey, who is the weed Lord of England that likes things in green, which is money and marijuana. Out of all the colorful characters in the movie, I thought Mickey was the least interesting if I have to be honest. Either because of McConaughey's chilled nature or the less exciting material given to his character. \n\nThe style and overall tone of the movie made the whole experience so fun to watch. Everything about the movie is quick. The dialogue is snappy and there's plenty of clever banter between characters. It's incredibly clear that Guy Richie loves cinema whenever he's not held back like some of his previous projects and gets to freely express his passion behind the craft. \n\nThe humor and jokes ain't for the faint of heart, but luckily I'm not that soft. Some of jokes didn't quite land the mark and often times left me puzzled in terms of waiting for the punchline. \n\nOverall rating: A disjointed, but entertaining movie. Misleading title though. There's plenty of man, but not so much on gentle.",

            "content": "'The Gentlemen' (2020)\nGuy Ritchie returns to the crime genre and what a solid return I must say. 'The Gentlemen' is a witty and fun ride, packed to the brim with great dialogue and great action. Each of the cast is mostly great in the film, especially Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant, and Matthew McConaughey. It's nice to finally see McConaughey in a good movie again after somewhat of a lull in his career in my opinion. Collin Farrell is great of course, although definitely seems to have less of a screen time than the prior three I had mentioned. I should also say that this is a very fast-paced film for the most part. It's one you certainly can't doze or space off during otherwise you may end up completely lost. The cinematography and screenplay overall is good, although the best aspect I believe is the script, extremely well-written, rich, smart, and witty dialogue throughout. If I were to pinpoint any criticisms, I suppose some of it would come down to the pacing as I mentioned before. Usually it's good, however it seems as though you either hit a slight lull here and there, or rather it's just bursting from scene to scene. The editing is also a peculiar case, in that it's normally good however will get very eccentric from time to time. Some of the acting was a bit iffy for me at times, mainly from Henry Golding, Jeremy Strong, and maybe a few lesser supporting characters, although at this point I think I'm nitpicking... 'The Gentlemen' is overall a fun movie and nice return-to-form for Guy Ritchie, and just a solid crime/action in general. I'd check it out if you haven't already.\n\nMy Rating - 7/10",

Guy's Back Baby!\n I don't think I can fault it. The dialogue, the acting, the cast, the action and gritty British humour which is its best.

Unlike many of his other films, however, this one starts off with a lot of exposition, but once it finds its footing it does not disappoint. The actors all seem to be having a blast and the ending wraps everything up so neatly that it's hard to find fault with the slower beginning. It's great to see Guy Richie back doing the modern gangster films he does best.\n\nClosest comparison: It's like The Godfather by way of Baby Driver, but without the musical choreography.\n\nSetting: Crime\nPlot: Blackmail\nTone: Action Comedy",

The class issues presented here and in Roma are well articulated but I would laud these productions as earning best film above some others.

The Gentlemen is a closer return to form than 2008's RocknRolla, but it's still a long way off from early Ritchie. The recognizable elements are there, from the convoluted story with twists and turns, the non-linear storytelling lapping and overlapping itself, the comical brushes with sudden violence, the colorful array of criminal characters, and a sense of style that seems all over the place. We follow Matthew McConaughey as a marijuana titan looking to get out of the business, though there are threats old, new, and \"just business\" that are trying to take his empire from him before his exit. The biggest problem with The Gentlemen is how clever it feels like it needs to be and how few characters there are to find interesting. Snatch, by contrast, forever contrast, was practically a Dick Tracy rogues gallery of all its memorable and unpredictable characters. These feel pretty rote, even our heroes, and the minority characters get even shorter shrift. The plot is also more complicated than it needs to be with an extended meta-textual layer of a lecherous Hugh Grant tabloid journalist pitching the story like it was a movie (irony: it is a movie!). It took maybe 45 minutes before I felt like the story was finally picking up momentum and stakes, and by the end, it felt like Ritchie was just extending his story with another twist and wrap-up, and then another twist and wrap-up, like the outer edges of the movie cannot be contained and somehow it's still even going. It's like Ritchie doesn't know when to walk away from his own party. Because of these things the pacing is wonky and there are more than a few tedious stretches. Colin Farrell has some amusing moments but should have been the main character as a boxing trainer who takes a shine to try and reform local hoodlums. McConaughey's character is too boring and always wins too easily, which makes him more boring. The Gentlemen is a C-level rendition of Ritchie's best material, and Snatch only shines even brighter with each new miss.\n\nNate's Grade: C+",

But they all kinda start out slow with back ground info and you have to figure things out , and then it gets better and better with whitty banter, has some plot twists, and surprise ending.  I always love the good looking real manly men actors he has, in this one its Matthew, Charlie Hunnam (hot, loved him in Guy's King Arthur), Hugh, Colin , and added in is Michelle Dockery who i loved in Downton Abbey.  She's a real bad a** in this movie wife to Matthew.  Great cast that works well together.  I enjoyed another Guy Ritchie whitty fun action packed movie.  Go see it ladies!  You can bring your man to this one!",

Yes, I like Mathew McConaughey, Hugh Grant, Charlie Hunnam, Colin Farrell, Jeremy Strong and since \"Crazy Rich Asians\" Henry Golding but nothing could save this movie.\n\nAt first, it was interesting seeing Grant playing against type but 15 minutes in his heavy put on English accent (Yes, I know he is English but never like this) so I was glad he was working with/against Charlie Hunnam but that wasn't enough.\n\nI am not a fan of Guy Ritchie and believe I have seen only one of his movies but his having directed, produced and written the screenplay for this movie I have no desire to see them or anymore by him.  This is an old type gangster movie with a few twists and turns, a lot of violence, racial comments against Asians, throw in some anti-Semitism along with homophobic darts not to forget the f, the many c words plus pig porn and blood and more blood and then some more blood!\n\nThe theatre was full and a few people laughed at some of the lines but I broke my 2 and only New Year's resolutions!",

It's like a verbose British version of  \"Pulp Fiction\" .  If you value your relationship, don't make this movie a date-night.

If you enjoyed Lock, Stock and And Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, then you will LOVE The Gentlemen.\n\nGO SEE IT!!!!!!",

He wants to sell his empire and chaos ensues.  Mathew is mis-cast and phones in a dreary boring performance.\n\nThe standout performance that saves this film for complete ruin is by Hugh Grant, who will likely get an oscar nod for his supporting role as a very kinky sleezy UK tabloid paparazzi cameraman.\n\nColin Farrell turns in an 'ok' role which is very similar to the Brad Pitt role in Snatch, so much so you groan at it.\n\nThe first half of this movie is soooo boring that I contemplated taking a nice stroll to the loo, which is 3 floors down in the basement in the crap theatre I was in.  It's two guys sitting and one guy telling a story.  Often about another guy sitting, talking.\n\nPerhaps most disturbing about this movie is that it is horrifically tone-deaf, with gratuitous racism towards jews in particular, as well as stereotyping horrors for asians, and the one token woman in the movie is subjected to a near-rape scene with almost zero fight back from her (after she is disarmed) I found it unpleasant.\n\nWorth a rental to see Hugh do a fantastic sleeze character.  Not good for much else.",

It was made by people who understand that movies need to entertain and who found a way to blend whimsy as in The Mask with the skillful cuts of Pulp Fiction and a storyline that borrows from Connery era Bond films. \n\nThats not to say the screenplay wasnt a captivating tale, or the acting mediocre. Neither could be further from the truth. \n\nThe story is Marvel-esque and the acting carries you comfortably into a suspension of disbelief by a twisty turny route through British Aristocracy and the brutality of the criminal mind. \n\nWith Downton Abbeys Michelle Dockery, Colin Farrell, Henry Golding and British star Charlie Hunnam you feel as if the biggest among young stars wanted to do this movie and collaborated at the top of their game. \n\nAll 5 thumbs up for this flick.",

For the most part I enjoy his movies especially the one's focused on the whole genre of 'gangster comedies.' He seems to be the best in these kind of films and The Gentlemen did not disappoint. The movie is about a marijuana distributor named Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) who is trying to sell his business off and retire. His potential buyer Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong) has some doubts about the business after some snags in the deal happen involving a hot headed young gangster named Dry Eye (Henry Golding). The movie is told in a series of flashbacks by an investigative journalist named Fletcher (Hugh Grant) who is talking to Mickey's right hand man Ray (Charlie Hunnam) and during this time we aw the viewer figure out that there's much more going on than it seems. The movie also stars Colin Farrell as Coach. I really enjoyed this one. It has a very complex plot where it takes you on a ride going back and forth with the story, so it's imperative to pay attention. It's very much like Ritchie's other gangster comedies where they don't really let you stop to think much and you have to go with it. The film has some very funny moments here and overall I enjoyed how it ended. I will say some people may be put off by the overall story as it sometimes kind of overcomplicates itself for the sake of moving the plot, but it didn't bother me much. This is a solid film and I highly recommend checking it out!",

It also includes a side business of modding cars, Chinese mafia looking to buy said businesses and a gang of boxing/rapping thugs. It was a perfect mix of action, comedy and classic moments. I haven\u2019t left the theatre so impressed in such a long times. Seriously go see The Gentlemen. This movie flew under my radar until now.",

And I am glad to say, as a fan of crime movies, this movie did not disappoint. I think that the most appealing part of this movie are the characters, at least for me. Specifically, McConaughey, Grant, and Farrell were the highlight performances for me. McConaughey was definitely the centerpiece of the film, shining as the villainous but gentlemen-like protagonist. Grant brought the charisma and the slight over the top performance this film needed. Farrell was a surprise because he had a lot heart as well as good comic relief. Charlie Hunnam also did great as Ray and Henry Golding as Dry Eye. I downgrade this film a little because it is very excessive in its language use and it also plays out a little predictably at some parts. It also has some slight pacing issues as well as a surprisingly weaker Jeremy Strong performance.  However, this is a great intro to Guy Ritchie's crime movies for me and I enjoyed it very much.",

Taking a step away from the traditional portrayals of organized crime the movie rocks amazing performances from the entire cast. The refreshing and twisting plot is fantastic and has quite a few commentary's on society.  While others tear down Matthew McConaughey's portrayal as flat but in reality he portrays a cold, cold sociopath who only becomes truly bothered by one thing... someone messing with his wife. His wife played by Michelle Dockery is a fantastic female character.  She is her own woman and NOT about to take crap from her husband or anyone else.  Dockery plays her perfectly.  Charlie Hunnam shines as a devoted and calm consigliere with his own quirks and ability to quickly adapt. Colin Farrell is a crazy nutball who finds himself in some unique positions due to the boys he trains. Henry Golding plays a hungry character that might be felt to be a bit stereotypical but fits in perfectly with this cast. Finally Hugh Grant blows everyone away by portraying the slimiest of slimiest characters ever.  Spending the money to see his performance so different from any others is well worth the money.  Overall, this is a great movie and far more refreshing than any other recent crime drama's from the likes of Martin Scorsese who seem to have excellent actors playing cookie cutter characters.",

Mickey (Matthew McConaughey), an American in London offers to sell his thriving British underground marijuana farms to fellow American billionaire, sleazy Matthew (Jeremy Strong, Succession) and blissfully exercise early retirement to fully enjoy Rosalind, Mickey\u2019s stiletto-heeled wife (Michelle Dockery, Downton Abbey) who runs an auto-repair garage staffed exclusively by women. But the lucrative drug trafficking opportunity is chumming the River Thames luring all manner of hungry fresh water sharks to the city. Taking the bait is Chinese gangster \u201cLord George\u201c (Tom Wu) but his underboss \u201cDry Eye\u201d (Henry Golding, Crazy Rich Asians), strutting his independence and representing the up and coming Asian gangsta youth movement, shoots a different plan to Lord George. Crooked private investigator/paparazzi reporter Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is cheerily dedicating his telephoto lens and camouflage expertise to blackmail Mickey\u2019s #1 henchman Ray (Charlie Hunnam, Sons of Anarchy) by selling the unfolding, exclusive, murdering mob and dope tale to tabloid owner \u201cBig Dave\u201d (Eddie Marsan, Vice) who is determined to enact revenge on Mickey who publicly snubbed diminutive Big Dave at a highfalutin London party. Whew! There you have it. Full circle. Mickey to Matthew to Lord George to Dry Eye to Fletcher to Ray to Big Dave back to Mickey. Well, not quite. There is \u201cCoach\u201d (Colin Farrell), neighborhood legend boxing coach who winds up owing three favors to Mickey because Coach\u2019s stable of brawling, YouTube viral-seeking karate kids overstepped their gym boundaries into Mickey\u2019s business. Coach not only pays off his debt but throws in one machine gun rescue as a bonus fourth favor. Then there\u2019s the Russian connection with former KGB czar daddy who takes exception to Aslan (Danny Griffin), his heir-apparent son face-planting the London sidewalk from two stories up, winding up in a body bag in Ray\u2019s home freezer. On the heels of Aslan\u2019s fall from fame is the demise of anorexic Laura (Eliot Sumner), daughter of Lord Pressfield (Samuel West). Lord Pressfield is an estate beneficiary of Matthew\u2019s enterprise, a literal \u201coverlord.\u201d His income is cut off because of tangling with the karate kid gang but Mickey, trying to make amends, promises to rescue Laura who gets mixed up with Aslan and it\u2019s a big heroin mess. Follow the Moscow Mule to the White Widow Super Cheese weed. Cannabis chaos. The entire movie is framed as a conversation between manic Fletcher and deliberate Ray. Fletcher pitches to Ray, typed up as a screen play at a $20 million price tag, the damning, blackmailing evidence he\u2019s clandestinely gathered. Ok? Got it? If it\u2019s any comfort, it took me so long to diagnose the movie-within-a-movie format that I missed important clues flying by in the fast and furious dialogue. Fletcher talked way too fast and Ray way too slow. The British slang went over my head. I like to think of myself as able to cope with the circuitous but this movie took such a scenic route that I wished for an occasional linear respite. For all I know the movie-within-the-movie was the movie. Confused? Me, too. Maybe buy two pretzels.",

In the same vein as Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels - The Gentlemen is a crime drama/comedy full of colorful well realized characters scheming to come up on some money or drugs. This movie has style to spare with whip smart dialogue, great editing, and audio that helps to move the transitions along. One of the more creative parts comes in the form of a gang of young robbers who video their crimes on go pros and make them into music videos that become viral hits on the web. Hilarious. \n\nWith more than a few twists and turns the movie is consistently engaging and surprising and I thoroughly enjoyed hearing the characters just talk to each other about random stuff. The banter is both witty and revealing, but doesn't drag on and is broken up by a healthy dose of violence every now and then. Ritchie's track record of late has been all over the place, but if you're a fan of his older movies you'll find more than one thing to love about this entertaining addition to his body of work.",

It seems to have a different idea of what the movie was supposed to be about and yet maintained a story that was discreet from the proposition. The sole highlight was the far too few scenes with Colin Farrel, which provided some humor, but not enough to carry the movie from mccaughney. Not great, not good slightly boring In places.",

This was a fun film.\n\nThis is directed and written by Guy Ritchie, and like his Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and, I believe, some of his other crime films (I haven't seen the rest) it relies on a lot of characters and twists-and-turns. What results is a good helping interesting moving parts, dialogue, and performances from great actors.\n\nThe script isn't quite as tight as LS&TSB. The movie could've been a bit shorter. The character of a tabloid editor played by Eddie Marsan could've been cut without effecting anything. I also felt the last scene missed a bit of a punch.\n\nThe previous criticisms are more nitpicks than major issues. Overall, this movie is a good time and I recommend it. It's not something you need to see immediately but should be given a shot.",

I agree with others who say if you are a fan of Ritchie's older films, \"Lockstock\" and \"Snatch\" you will enjoy The Gentlemen. It's just a fun movie. I laughed out loud several times. While I enjoyed all the performances for me Hugh Grant as Fletcher stole the show. I'm a bit of a fangirl for Charlie Hunnam and I really enjoyed the character of Raymond. A bit of a departure from his usual role as eye candy. No scenes including his bare bottom or shirtless torso here. Quite the opposite. He's impeccably dressed from head to toe through the whole film. He is be-speckled with slicked backed hair and a beard covering his gorgeous face.  I found it refreshing. I thought he was able to disappear into the character without getting glimpses of Jax Teller or King Arthur. The entire cast was terrific. While watching the movie I kept waiting for Colin Farrell to appear wondering how he was going to fit into the story. I was not left disappointed. I recommended this film to my family and friends. I definitely think it's one I would stop and watch if I passed by it while scrolling through channels.",

In the hands of a lesser screenwriter the deluge of expletives would be juvenile and unfunny, but in the Ritchie-verse it becomes something akin to wallpaper. Listen to his complex creative language and one comes to realize that Ritchie is a high poet who makes the most quotable movies of our age (sorry Judd Apatow and Kevin Smith). Ritchie's ear for soundtrack choices is spot on. I am not so much of a fan of Charlie Hunnam or Michelle Dockery as to find them irreplaceable here. However in the acting the department the veterans  Matthew McConaughey, Colin Farrell, and Jeremy Strong  hit home runs here. Further, all heads must be bowed to the nearly unrecognizable accent show that is laid down by Hugh Grant. I might be ready for a Guy Ritchie Extended Universe.",

It's visually brilliant - truly brilliant - masterfully filmed and edited to give every actor's performance the platform and transparency they deserve! My one tiny \"dislike\" was the overwhelming use of my all-time least favorite word in the English Language - \"cun!\" Every time I hear that word it has a physical impact on my senses. I realize it has a different connotation in the UK than it does in the US, but just like too much F-word gets used for a visceral response, that word triggers an even more visceral one in me. Other than that, it's a genius story, beautifully crafted and expertly told!",

            "content": "Nothing too unexpected here, but it's funny and hugely entertaining\n\nThe Gentlemen is a return to the London gangster milieu where writer/director Guy Ritchie first made his name with films such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and snatch. (2000). And yes, the film seems stuck in the last decade in more ways than one, it's highly questionable that the only gay character is a slimy man-whore into S&M, its only female character barely even manages to rise to the level of tokenism, and Ritchie does absolutely nothing new here, but The Gentlemen is still hugely entertaining. Most of the jokes land, the dialogue is as sharp and expletive-laden as ever, the cast are having a ball, and the self-reflexivity works well for the most part. The plot is as derivative as it gets, but Ritchie has injected real verve into it. The Gentlemen won't change your life, but it will make you laugh.\n\nThe film begins as sleazy private eye Fletcher (Hugh Grant) arrives unannounced at the home of Ray (Charlie Hunnam), right-hand man to Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), an Oxford-educated American ex-pat who controls a huge marijuana empire in London. Several months prior, Fletcher was hired by tabloid editor Big Dave (Eddie Marsen) to dig up dirt on Pearson, and Fletcher has written a screenplay based on his investigation, telling Ray that unless Pearson pays him \u00a320 million, he will hand over everything he has to Dave. Meanwhile, Pearson has decided to sell his whole operation, but when word gets out, all hell breaks loose, as the various interested parties vie for advantage. Most of the subsequent film takes the form of Fletcher narrating his exploits to Ray, explaining how he learned so much about Pearson and what he does.\n\nAesthetically, The Gentlemen is very much in the mould of Ritchie's previous gangster movies. Because Fletcher frames his narration as a screenplay, it allows Ritchie to employ a multitude of self-reflexive devices \u2013 a smash cut coinciding with Fletcher asking Ray to visualise a smash cut; on-screen captions telling us who's who; animated maps; freeze-frames; rewinds; a shot of film running through a projector etc. At one point, Fletcher is discussing the merits of anamorphic over 1.78:1, and the film's aspect ratio changes accordingly. At another, he's arguing for the merits of 35mm celluloid over digital, and the film duly switches formats. Such playfulness means that it never for a second takes itself too seriously, and it remains immensely fun, with the more you know about the mechanics of assembling a film, the more humorously self-reflexive the film becomes \u2013 Fletcher even acknowledges his own role as an unreliable narrator.\n\nIn terms of themes, the most obvious is the idea that the economic divide between gangsters and aristocrats masks their practical similarities. The smooth running of Pearson's business depends on both classes \u2013 the aristocrats who he needs to grow his product and the gangsters who distribute that product. The clash between the pompous insularity of the English upper class and the perceived uncouthness of the lower class has been done to death in both literature (Wuthering Heights (1847) springs to mind) and film (Performance, for example), and although Ritchie doesn't say anything even remotely new about it, it still forms an interesting textural background \u2013 gentrification is ever-present; there are ironic references to the posh areas of Croydon; Ray, a working-class Newcastle native, is a cleanliness freak who eats wagyu steak and lives in a mansion, and when he's dispatched on a mission to an uncivilised working-class area, he explains he \"just hates them junkies,\" seeing them as very much his social inferiors.\n\nOne of the most central scenes sees Ray and his mn clash with a gang of machete-wielding thugs on a council estate, and there's a real sense of old vs. new \u2013 traditional gangsters fighting it out with internet-savvy hoodlums who don't give a damn about tradition or respect. There are a lot of laughs to be had with these issues, such as Ray and Coach (a scene-stealing Colin Farrell) having problems pronouncing the name Phuc. And again, none of this is presented as even remotely serious.\n\nThe biggest problems with the film are probably its lack of depth, and the familiarity of the presentation, characters, and milieu \u2013 there's nothing here you haven't seen in previous Ritchie films. And as you would expect, there isn't much in the way of emotional maturity or narrative complexity. It's all very surface-level, and it makes no apologies for such.\n\nNevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed The Gentlemen. It's a funny as hell caper and the actors are clearly having terrific fun. It might be formulaic and overly familiar, but it's also immensely enjoyable.",

The movie is surprisingly good with a witty script that is filled with humor; a story that is filled with twists and turns, and a huge cast ensemble which everyone does a great job in their characters. I did think the movie was kind of boring in the first half hour until it picks up. The movie is not in a chronological order. The plot follows Reporter Fletcher (Hugh Grant) breaks into Raymond's (Charlie Hunnam) home. Requesting a lot of money in exchange for a return that Raymond's boss Mickey (Matthew McConaughey) and his organization of pot dealing story does not get sold to a movie studio. Fletcher and Raymond go over the story on what happened in the past. With Mickey wanting to retire from his organization. Which Dry Eye (Henry Golding) is trying to buy his organization but Mickey refuses. Creating a conflict with Dry Eye. Meanwhile, Coach (Colin Farrell) and his group of young adults accidently breaks into Mickey's plant farm. While Raymond is trying to get everything settled with dealing any conflict that Mickey has. It was a good story. It was all over the place. From the perspectives as Fletcher was talking to Raymond about in the beginning of the movie. There is a scene that Fletcher wrote a screen play from when he was spying on Matthew (Jeremy Strong) and Dry eye. Which he has himself and Raymond acting it out. It was funny and stupid. The film does have some fun humor. Then, there are some dark and serious moments which can be tough to watch. The cast ensemble is great with the movie. Matthew McConaughey takes the lead playing Mickey. There are some powerful moments when a dramatic tension leads him to fighting back. Charlie Hunnam was great. Henry Golding was good playing Dry Eye. Rosalind who is Mickey's wife played by Michelle Dockery is also good as well. Jeremy Strong and Eddie Marsan are good. Colin Farrell was good and funny with his character. Hugh Grant almost unrecognizable playing Fletcher was funny and good. Guy Ritchie direction and script delivered a gangster drama movie with witty dialogue, narrative, and humor. It is what you can expect in a Guy Ritchie's movie. There are some over dramatic moments with a powerful music score by Christopher Benstead. Overall, The Gentlemen is a good action crime film. It does have a slow and confusing narrative beginning. The film kicks off with a humorous and witty direction and a good cast to hold the movie together with a story that has plenty of twists and turns to make it worth watching.",

GUY RITCHIE!!!!!! GUY FREAKING RITCHIE !!!! Is BACK to his old CLASSIC roots and he absolute 100% NOOOOOO DOUBT provessss why he STILL is one of the KINGS of Hollywood!!! This film INSTANTLY is one of his GREATEST movie he was ever written and directed! It is up there with Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels!! All 3 are totally different and their own movie but also the same and it is just AMAZING and beyond talented how a filmmaker can do that! All around from small part to big part EVERY character was P.E.R.F.E.C.T casting.... Freaking MIC DROP! They all took their charter made it there own and just rannnnnnn with it! Colin Farrell and Charlie Hunnam were our two FAVORITE characters through the film! Those two gave PHENOMENAL jaw dropping performances!! They both had us crying laughing out of our seats in their own ways! WHILE also both being extremely BADASS!! This is going to be hard to say but honestly might be our most favorite role from Charlie Hunnam and we LOVE Hunnam! As for Farrell he can literally do ANYTHING.... Enough said. Now for the KING of the Jungle.. MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY played a MAGNIFICENT leading man that was in charge of everything. He was the leader of the packet and he did NOT disappoint like always. He was serious,smart,cockey, HILARIOUS and a BAD MOFO! Enough said! Michelle Dockery was BRILLIANT as the movies leading lady! She was sexy, spectacular And believable all around. She needs more roles to play. This movie is literally going to be in our TOP 5 all year!! And yes it\u2019s extremely early to say that but TRUST US because you will totally understand after you see this MONA LISA for your self! BEAUTIFULLY written, directed and just crafted!! So many memorable unforgettable scenes and lines from this movie! Guy Ritchie is back and STILL at the TOP of his game!! Go see The Gentlemen ASAP!! ENOUGH SAID!!!",

Anemic is actually an understatement. If you can make it through the first half hour without using your popcorn bag as a receptacle for the contents of your stomach, then you, like most of the viewing public at this point in the history of humanity, have lost all ability to discriminate...notice the difference between inspired creativity and a desperate formula. Matthew McConaughey is who he always is in every film, unwatchable. The script is supposed to be engrossing but it just doesn't deliver. It's like a train off the rails the entire time, plowing forward anyway, grating noise, going nowhere. The plot and dialogue are so utterly contrived and lame that I actually felt sorry for the actors, some of whom are quite talented, struggle to bring vitality to this total P.O.S.

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nThe Gentlemen is done dirty by a January opening. It's an April, at least. The movie is more of an experiment in ASMR sexual harassment on the part of some attractive no good doers from Ritchie's past projects. The story is a bit of a mousetrap of chronologies and unreliable narration, which makes it fun and tightly packed, well-paced, and oddly both more and less self-aware than some of his previous projects.I have a soft and blind spot for Guy Ritchie films. I don't usually know I'm watching one unless Charlie Hunnam is in it. I've passively consumed a lot of Ritchie's big budget films in my childhood and early adolescence. I am continually surprised by the ways that his aesthetic both parodies and plays along with some themes of toxic masculinity: the gestures toward gay- and race-baiting for humor, the way that self-aware British culture clashes with American sensibilities about masculinity, and the unexpected joy of a bro-y film that doesn't need to feel like a game of Cards Against Humanity with your edgelord friends from college. The Gentlemen is a who's who of Ritchie's oeuvre of caper and gangster flicks along with actors on the rise like Henry Golding and Michelle Dockery (of Downton fame), and Matthew McConnaughey saucily eye-fing the camera the entire movie. Spoilers ahead. Ritchie makes moves toward metatheatrical storytelling in his editing, his occasional illustrated captioning, an inset narrative, and the not-so-subtle parables wrapped in trailer material. The opening shot of this movie, in which McConnaughey dies, is startling, and the rewind and reconstruction of events, which has the room for embellishment and authorial focalization, are elements of novel direction, but there are other things that are less innovative, notably the rape threat, which amounts to maybe the biggest missed opportunity for a rewind. One cannot help but think of moments like these as unforced errors. It's not our job to explain away the sloppiness of these choices for \"time\" or \"movie length,\" because when you're movie has a full on music video of fight porn, you lose the excuse of having trimmed the plot to its barest bones. It can't be fun to be the critic finger wagging at the twee racist jokes of a much beloved genre director of dark comedies. I expect that everyone's sensitivities will be tested at some point or another in this movie, but I'm personally a lot less guilty about laughing at the casually racist jokes in this movie than I am about the constant undercurrent of faux homosexual tension that's pervasive in this movie. If this is a directorial decision that's supposed to satirize the BDE of the genre heroes, I am open in being persuaded to like it. In terms of fun ways that Ritchie defuses my anxieties about racist accents and the rest: the movement of our sympathies from the first time we meet The Toddlers and their original entry versus the final scenes or the Three Strikes joke (I'm reading this in my notes, I don't know what these means anymore) shows how Ritchie can play on our expectations of what a Bro-y movie with a lot of Anglo strongmen would think about a bunch of black and brown tykes with GoPros strapped to their heads. Even the way that Colin Ferrell educates the kids in the shop is an excellent twist to his own character, because it feels like he's toying with some inner city hooligans, in part, to deflate their egos, but we then learn that this is sort of his whole deal. The way Ferrell responds to his Toddlers when they ask, \"Is everything OK, Coach?\" with \"No, it's not fine\" and admonishment for their past actions does a lovely job of injecting their relationship with the pathos of a mentor. I guess there's some insidious racism implicit in the idea that the only thing standing between these boys and crime is a rough tongued Irishman, but honestly the conversation on race that the Coach and his student have does enough to show that the film is at least aware of criticism. Laugh out loud moments in this movie were reserved for the dragon fable and it\u2019s rewind--Wife and Friend were both tickled by it and Wife went in unaware of the trailer, so I think it was doubly funny for her. The rewinds on Dry Eye's introduction are a way of being able to build character for the narrator and create a sense that our story is unreliable. The way that the inset narrative eventually leads to the present moment of storytelling is an excellent control of plot. The foiling of blackmail and new relationships that are blended together post the journalist's initial run through of the story makes for a powerful second act. I like the twisty chronology of the beginning moment of the McConnaughey's murder and the way that Hugh Grant's twist with the Russian oligarch changes the trajectory of the story. Might have to think on this one a little harder, but I definitely recommend.",

(2000). And yes, the film seems stuck in the last decade in more ways than one, it's highly questionable that the only gay character is a slimy man-whore into S&M, its only female character barely even manages to rise to the level of tokenism, and Ritchie does absolutely nothing new here, but The Gentlemen is still hugely entertaining. Most of the jokes land, the dialogue is as sharp and expletive-laden as ever, the cast are having a ball, and the self-reflexivity works well for the most part. The plot is as derivative as it gets, but Ritchie has injected real verve into it. The Gentlemen won't change your life, but it will make you laugh.The film begins as sleazy private eye Fletcher (Hugh Grant) arrives unannounced at the home of Ray (Charlie Hunnam), right-hand man to Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), an Oxford-educated American ex-pat who controls a huge marijuana empire in London. Several months prior, Fletcher was hired by tabloid editor Big Dave (Eddie Marsen) to dig up dirt on Pearson, and Fletcher has written a screenplay based on his investigation, telling Ray that unless Pearson pays him \u00a320 million, he will hand over everything he has to Dave. Meanwhile, Pearson has decided to sell his whole operation, but when word gets out, all hell breaks loose, as the various interested parties vie for advantage. Most of the subsequent film takes the form of Fletcher narrating his exploits to Ray, explaining how he learned so much about Pearson and what he does.Aesthetically, The Gentlemen is very much in the mould of Ritchie's previous gangster movies. Because Fletcher frames his narration as a screenplay, it allows Ritchie to employ a multitude of self-reflexive devices \u2013 a smash cut coinciding with Fletcher asking Ray to visualise a smash cut; on-screen captions telling us who's who; animated maps; freeze-frames; rewinds; a shot of film running through a projector etc. At one point, Fletcher is discussing the merits of anamorphic over 1.78:1, and the film's aspect ratio changes accordingly. At another, he's arguing for the merits of 35mm celluloid over digital, and the film duly switches formats. Such playfulness means that it never for a second takes itself too seriously, and it remains immensely fun, with the more you know about the mechanics of assembling a film, the more humorously self-reflexive the film becomes \u2013 Fletcher even acknowledges his own role as an unreliable narrator.In terms of themes, the most obvious is the idea that the economic divide between gangsters and aristocrats masks their practical similarities. The smooth running of Pearson's business depends on both classes \u2013 the aristocrats who he needs to grow his product and the gangsters who distribute that product. The clash between the pompous insularity of the English upper class and the perceived uncouthness of the lower class has been done to death in both literature (Wuthering Heights (1847) springs to mind) and film (Performance, for example), and although Ritchie doesn't say anything even remotely new about it, it still forms an interesting textural background \u2013 gentrification is ever-present; there are ironic references to the posh areas of Croydon; Ray, a working-class Newcastle native, is a cleanliness freak who eats wagyu steak and lives in a mansion, and when he's dispatched on a mission to an uncivilised working-class area, he explains he \"just hates them junkies,\" seeing them as very much his social inferiors.One of the most central scenes sees Ray and his mn clash with a gang of machete-wielding thugs on a council estate, and there's a real sense of old vs. new \u2013 traditional gangsters fighting it out with internet-savvy hoodlums who don't give a damn about tradition or respect. There are a lot of laughs to be had with these issues, such as Ray and Coach (a scene-stealing Colin Farrell) having problems pronouncing the name Phuc. And again, none of this is presented as even remotely serious.The biggest problems with the film are probably its lack of depth, and the familiarity of the presentation, characters, and milieu \u2013 there's nothing here you haven't seen in previous Ritchie films. And as you would expect, there isn't much in the way of emotional maturity or narrative complexity. It's all very surface-level, and it makes no apologies for such.Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed The Gentlemen. It's a funny as hell caper and the actors are clearly having terrific fun. It might be formulaic and overly familiar, but it's also immensely enjoyable.",

As the arguable Tarantino of Britain, Ritchie uses dialogue and a clever, interwoven storyline to keep the audience ensnared, laughing, and sometimes shocked at the right moment.

The movie is well written and stylishly shot with a web-tangle story that comedically unfolds through Hugh Grant's wonderful narration to Charlie Hunnam's mild amusement and annoyance. Matthew McConaughey stars as the king of the streets and delivers a great performance that demands the screen like no other as they twist and turn through the mystery of the story. The pace tends to slow a bit but is never boring due to the writing and sheer madness of the characters we meet throughout. Standouts like Grant and Colin Farrell elevate the material they are given and Hunnam's straight man performance is enough to have fun when he finally does get involved in the violent chaos of the movie.",

Matthew McConaughey was highly convincing in the part, with a brilliant supporting cast that is really able to sell their roles and the accompanying banter. I would say that it's definitely not for everyone - it is something of a gangster movie - but still amounts to something like a crime comedy, which Guy Ritchie is naturally good at.

As someone who's clung so unabashedly to the notion that his \"Sherlock Holmes\" films are the best things he's ever done, I was wary of this return to the early days for Ritchie. I don't particularly dislike movies like \"Lock, Stock,\" \"Snatch\" or \"RocknRolla.\" I just find them a bit too showy and brash for my tastes. However, it seems the skills accrued via those jaunts through studio-dom have perhaps melded with the indie sensibilities that were already so present within the man. And the movie's all better for it. Yes, \"The Gentlemen\" is still undeniably Ritchie, but with just the right amount of focus, tact and accessibility to make even the most fervent of Ritchie-deniers leave the theater feeling satisfied. As shocked as I am to say this, I have to admit - I honestly think this is my favorite of the \"proper\" Guy Ritchie gangster flicks.",

What results is a good helping interesting moving parts, dialogue, and performances from great actors.The script isn't quite as tight as LS&TSB. The movie could've been a bit shorter. The character of a tabloid editor played by Eddie Marsan could've been cut without effecting anything.

Charlie Hunnam actually is great in this film which has been something I haven't ever been able to say. Maybe we should keep him with his accent from now on. While Mathew McConaughey is wonderful as a brutal mob boss he kept me wanting more. Hugh Grant was without my favorite character he kept you guessing what he was up to the entire movie making you want more and more. I loved this movie from the dialog to the twisty plot and believe it is a must rent of this year to say the least. I personally will be adding The Gentlemen to my blu-ray collection without hesitation.",

The cast and premise of this film were enough to intrigue me to give this latest outing of his a go. Matthew McConaughey plays an American-born drug lord residing in England, who plans to retire and sell off his business. However, it doesn't go so simply, as he's marked for death by many hitmen and criminals who want in on his fortune and position of power, which in turn, involves various other criminals throughout England. The cast is easily the best thing about this film! McConaughey gives an always reliably charismatic lead performance, along with some rather humorous supporting turns from Charlie Hunnam, Colin Farrell, and Hugh Grant to name a few. The action and fights are quite fun to watch, and there are some funny moments to be had. However, story-wise, it came up a bit short for me. Things get a little overly convoluted and the movie dragged itself out a little longer than I would've liked. The film took its time with a couple plot points longer than necessary too in my eyes. Overall, it's a welcome return to form for Guy Ritchie, as he's mainly been focusing on big budget fare like 'King Arthur' and the live-action 'Aladdin' as of late, and there's some funny lines and moments throughout, but the story's a little too convoluted and dragged out for its own good that it didn't quite justify the handful of moments I did enjoy. I anticipate those who are bigger fans of Ritchie's British crime films will enjoy it a little more than I did.",

It\u2019s crazy to think that this is the same guy who brought us last years \u2018Aladdin.\u2019 But this time Ritchie isn\u2019t on a leash.I honestly didn\u2019t expect to enjoy \u2018The Gentleman\u2019 as much as I did. A little muddle and sometimes confusing to follow, but the movie has a certain sharpness to it that kept me interested throughout. It\u2019s more in vein with \u2018Lock Shock\u2019 and \u2018Snatch\u2019. Ritchie has made a successful career being influenced by the work of Quentin Tarantino, hence his given title \u201cBritish Tarantino\u201d. The cast are all having an absolute blast with the material and I can tell everyone wants to be there. Hugh Grant is my personal favorite out of the cast and it\u2019s great to see his enthusiasm in acting again. He plays Fletcher, a gay detective who documents the events in the story into a screenplay he\u2019s writing, so in a way it\u2019s told from his perspective. While debatable if everything in the movie was made up or not, cause \u201cevery movie needs a bit of action\u201d. The thing I love about Grants performance is that he isn\u2019t playing \"typical Hugh Grant\", but an actual character. Although I thought the running gag of him being openly gay and constantly makes flirty hints towards other male characters got old and awkward after awhile. A joke that out stay\u2019s it\u2019s welcome...kinda like Fletcher.I\u2019m not a big fan of Charlie Hunnam as an actor, as I usually find him bland in everything I\u2019ve seen him so far. However I thought Hunnam delivered a solid performance in this movie and might be his best. He plays Ray, Mickey\u2019s (McConaughey) right hand man who is professional when it comes to business despite the countless idiots in his path. Imagine Russell Bufalino from \u2018The Irishman\u2019, but more physical and incredibly British. His comedic timing was pretty good as well that maybe if you give him the right material and character, he\u2019s a better actor than I thought.Colin Farrell was terrific as Coach and my second favorite out of the cast. He\u2019s ridiculously cool and shows who\u2019s boss, but also display\u2019s some comedic chops. Matthew McConaughey was chilled as Mickey, who is the weed Lord of England that likes things in green, which is money and marijuana. Out of all the colorful characters in the movie, I thought Mickey was the least interesting if I have to be honest. Either because of McConaughey's chilled nature or the less exciting material given to his character. The style and overall tone of the movie made the whole experience so fun to watch. Everything about the movie is quick. The dialogue is snappy and there\u2019s plenty of clever banter between characters. It\u2019s incredibly clear that Guy Richie loves cinema whenever he\u2019s not held back like some of his previous projects and gets to freely express his passion behind the craft. The humor and jokes ain't for the faint of heart, but luckily I\u2019m not that soft. Some of jokes didn\u2019t quite land the mark and often times left me puzzled in terms of waiting for the punchline. Overall rating: A disjointed, but entertaining movie. Misleading title though. There\u2019s plenty of man, but not so much on gentle.",
