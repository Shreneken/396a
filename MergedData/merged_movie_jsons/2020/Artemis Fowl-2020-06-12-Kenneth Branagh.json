            "content": "It's actually been a long time since reading the book series, but from retrospect they were certainly better than this film version. Love Disney and Disney+ has been a godsend recently and watched regularly actually, one of many reasons as to why my reviewing here has slowed down. Kenneth Branagh is a gifted director, absolutely love his Shakespeare adaptations with 'Much Ado About Nothing' being a personal favourite (though others will prefer the also great 'Hamlet' and 'Henry V'). Love Judi Dench as an actress too.'Artemis Fowl' was a real disappointment. As an adaptation it's an abomination, one of the worst book to film adaptations there is in existence. Am not kidding here. It fares even worse on its own terms, despite what those that have defended the film say some that have hated the film have not read the books and saw it as fans of Branagh and Dench, my parents being among those people. Almost nothing works and Branagh has never been this uninterested in his directing in what is easily his worst film (those that disliked 'Murder on the Orient Express', didn't care for that myself while not hating it, will appreciate that film better after seeing this).The least bad asset is actually the music score, which is actually beautiful to listen to, authentically Irish and lilting. Sadly it was one of those scores that were pleasant enough on their own but failed to fit within the film, this score sounded like it belonged somewhere else. The scenery also wasn't bad in parts but the photography generally is rushed looking and some of the images thanks to some very disjointed editing and garish lighting are quite ugly so that was wasted too. Any special effects are afterthought-looking.Moving on further onto the criticisms, the acting is really not good. Ferdia Shaw is monotone and charisma-free throughout. Lara McDonnell has more perkiness but the character is very underwritten and bland on the whole. Colin Farrell is completely wasted. Josh Gad tries too hard is gets very annoying after a while, actually thought he didn't blend very well with everything else. You know something is wrong when Dench gives the least bad performance and still manages to give one of her worst performances, that affected accent and voice was not needed and she doesn't look engaged at times. At least she showed some signs of having command over her meagre material.Branagh was clearly not interested in the material, as his direction throughout is uncharacteristically indifferent and phoned in. One would not think that he is a great Shakespearean director, and he did prove with his wonderful 'Cinderella' that he could do non-Shakespeare too, as this is quite inept. The target audience also felt confused, my mother was very unsure at who 'Artemis Fowl' was aimed at, children will find it hard to follow and it is too dull for adults. Even teens, the main target audience of the book series, will question the target audience.Script is stilted and is too exposition-heavy (apparent right from the beginning with an over-explanatory narration), a lot of the film screeching to a deadening halt in the more talky sections and there are a lot of those. The storytelling is incredibly thin and not does it feel like a hodge podge of cobbled togther ideas it is all executed in a dull fashion and with little coherence, literally only one event happens. There is one action show-piece pretty much with a troll very late on but even that doesn't thrill and even the troll doesn't look that good. There is no character development whatsoever, nobody is given time to breathe, the villain is a non-entity and Artemis himself is practically useless. What little there is of the action is sluggish, incoherently edited and the sense of danger just isn't there. To cap it all off, the ending was a completely abrupt anti-climax.In summary, very poor. 2/10",

I don't feel like I watched the movie because I couldn't tell you anything about it, it's just like a blur.The acting was pretty bad and I don't know why but when I was watching it I just got this like early 2000s vibe from it and I don't know why. Like I think this would have done better if it was made then. It just had that type of feel.The writing was also pretty bad too.

Clearly.\nPacked with all the muddled and addled virtue signalling nonsense that you could ever need.

We seem to be in a place in film making where it is taboo and forbidden for anyone to represent negative qualities of any kind. Everyone is good and nice to each other except for characters hidden in cloaks or the colonial British man.Josh Gads narration is not only entirely unnecessary but delivered like a high school students first assessment project.Holly is wrecked. Root is wrecked. Foaley is nothing. Mulch is intolerable. Butler is wrecked. Juliet is nothing.0 tension. 0 nuance. 0 technique.It may be the worst adaption of a book I've ever seen.

The script is terrible and wasted with so much going with the story crammed in such a short running time. The plot is a mess. And the whole setting of the movie takes place with the fairies army invading Artemis house by the beach. The movies narrative structure by Josh Gad was just plain stupid. And annoying. The performances are tedious and bad. There was no emotional connections with the characters. The villain is undeveloped. And no explanation to the bad guys motive. The action sequences are boring. The visual effects seemed incomplete and cheesy. The direction by Kenneth Branagh is a complete wreck with this film. From the director that did Thor and Murder on Orient Express. This movie sure fails to entertain. I do wonder how would this film even be in theatres cause it definitely felt like a straight to TV movie with its quality.

            "review_title": "This Film Fell Apart As It Was Being Made",
            "content": "This has been a strange year for new movies. From studios releasing some of their anticipated films early on-demand to straight-up selling the rights to streaming services, Disney must not have had faith in Artemis Fowl, but nobody thought twice about it going to their streaming service, due to theatres being closed anyways. Well, they have officially dropped their newest original film and I'll admit that I was mildly curious about seeing it since the first trailer. There's no beating around the bush here though, because this film is just really bad, all around. I'm not one to rip a movie apart, seeing how much work really goes into making them, but sometimes the end result is just too much of a mess to praise.With all the confidence in the world, young Artemis Fowl (Ferdia Shaw) makes it his mission to hunt down the magical fairies that kidnapped his father. I mean, that's the set-up of the film and all, but this movie takes far too many detours to really get a grasp on what's unfolding. The most annoying aspect of this movie is present for a lot of the duration as well. Mulch Diggums (Josh Gad) is a character that is front and center from the very beginning, even though he's very far from the main character. They choose to have him narrate at least a good 30 minutes of the film and it's not just to provide context. His narration is pretty much there to describe every detail of the characters and the plot they are in so that nobody misses anything. This movie treats the audience like very little children. On top of that, this movie gets so bogged down in other side plots that the narration becomes useless anyway.After watching Artemis Fowl, I had to do a double-take when I remembered that Kenneth Branagh had directed it. Although I wasn't a huge fan of his rendition of Murder on the Orient Express a couple of years ago, I thoroughly enjoyed his work on movies like Thor and the live-action remake of Cinderella. His direction has always been strong to me, and I could be wrong here, but there's no way that he had the final say on a lot of this final cut. Over a year ago there was a trailer for this movie and a lot of the footage seen in that trailer was clearly from a different movie. This is yet another movie that has fallen victim to the studio pushing the filmmakers in many of the wrong directions.For the most part, the visual effects are definitely worthy of a mainstream theatrical release, but they made the movie also feel more childish than the story really was. In addition to that, I'm really not sure who this film is supposed to be aimed at. Obviously it was made for kids in hopes to start a franchise for them, but I don't see many kids being able to follow this film from start to finish. They will have many questions for their parents and I fear that the movie will be so uninteresting for them, that they won't even know how to explain it. This is a complete mess of a story that was taken apart and pieced together multiple times in the editing room, so I'm not even sure who's most at fault for this one. I don't want to single out a particular department here, but I would be fascinated to see a behind-the-scenes documentary for this movie.Overall, Artemis Fowl is a film that starts out as a Spy Kids rip-off but very quickly becomes this overdone film, which reminded me of how I felt about Jupiter Ascending, but honestly even more of a mess. I could see some solid elements of family trying to jump out of this movie, but anything worth noting is buried too deep to notice. I've never seen young Ferdia Shaw act before, but I hope he is given some smaller roles after this to improve himself because I believe his acting abilities were not to the calibre that a movie of this size requires. Even some of the musical cues in some of the more dramatic moments felt like epic pieces that belonged in an adventure or action sequence. Everything about Artemis Fowl just feels off and I was both uninterested and frustrated pretty early on. Even though it's available to stream if you have Disney+, I still can't recommend it.",

            "review_title": "An atrocious family blockbuster with very few redeeming qualities",
            "content": "The movie centers around Artemis Fowl, a child prodigy who also claims to be a criminal mastermind. The story is narrated by a rather large dwarf named Mulch Diggums who is being interrogated. Artemis Fowl's dad has been kidnapped and he goes on a quest with his servant, Domovoi Butler and a fairy he captures, Holly Short. He and his crew are confronted by the other fairies as they try to reach a conclusion that will help them reach their goals.So Artemis Fowl is Disney's latest sci-fi family blockbuster. It is based on Eoin Colfer's novel of the same name. What is odd about the film is the fact that Disney decided to send it straight to Disney+. Disney did not even try to find another theatrical release date for this film despite having a budget of $125,000,000. I decided to watch it today and after seeing, ooh boy, I now know why Disney made this decision...Artemis Fowl is an absolute disaster of a film. Just about every element of the movie falls flat. The story is barely a story. There are a couple of interesting elements here such as the fairies' ability to wipe out memories and stop time, but it is not explained and it comes off as unoriginal more than anything. The biggest problem with the movie is that it is incoherent and that it is an \"adventure\" film that pretty much takes place in one setting: Artemis' house. Artemis does not go anywhere else until the end of the movie and it is only to wrap up the thin plot. The world building could have been good, but it is sloppily executed which makes the world feel shallow. The movie cannot decide whether it wants to be campy or serious and it fails at both. The characters are terrible too. Artemis Fowl is such an unlikable protagonist that has that attitude where he thinks he is better than everyone. He belittles Holly when he captures her for no other reason aside from gloating about how he is better than her... and that is our incredibly likable hero. I heard that in the novel that he is supposed to be the villain, but movie never treats him like a villain at all. He makes up with Holly in the most forced way possible and they suddenly become good friends after just few minutes. Artemis and Holly have absolutely no chemistry with the performances or with the characters. They just suddenly become friends because... the plot requires it? Speaking of performances, I just want to say I feel so bad for Ferdia Shaw who played as Artemis Fowl. He is trying his best, but his performance is just dreadful. It is just painful to watch and his performance is definitely on the crew that failed him. It's actually his first role and it definitely shows. I hope that he will shine in another project some day, particularly one that is more competent than this. The supporting cast is not much better. Colin Farrell is completely wasted on one of the most thankless roles I have ever seen as Artemis' dad. He gets nothing to do. Why go through the trouble of casting Farrell if you're not going to use him? Lara McDonnell is okay as Holly Short, but her character is just the generic action girl with no interesting traits. Judi Dench is easily the standout as Holly's commanding officer, but she can only do so much with the dreadful material that gives her little to work with. Josh Gad plays as the comic relief and narrator, Mulch Diggums. Admittedly, he seems to be having a lot of fun in the role and he got some chuckles out of me, but the narration was rather pointless. In fact, most of the narration is boring exposition that explains to the audience what the plot of the film is. They also do something really stupid with his character in the middle of the film. Nonso Anozie plays as Artemis' servant and he pretty much phones it in the entire time. His character is just completely indifferent and flat. The cast is not the biggest problem with the film, but no one can save the material they have to work with. I mentioned that the film had some humorous moments and aside from a couple of scenes that made me regrettably chuckle and one particular scene that put a smile on my face, most of it falls completely flat. It feels so tone-deaf and amateurish. I honestly thought at the beginning that the film could be so bad that it's good, but it quickly became really boring. There are some unintentionally funny moments of dialogue, but for the most part, the film is just painful to watch. The climax in the film is just awful. Not only is it incredibly anti-climatic, but the twist for it is dumb.Despite having a huge budget, the movie looks incredibly cheap for 2020. The CGI is atrocious in this film. None of it looks believable or even pleasant. The fairy designs look ugly, the water effects look like something that would come from an PlayStation 2 game and the fairy world looks terrible. It is some of the worst looking effects I have seen in a blockbuster film. The only thing that looked good were the ships that the fairies traveled in. The set designs look better and there are parts of the fairy world that look imaginative, but it's buried under the poor CGI effects for the most part. The action scenes are badly shot and edited. The camera work during the fights is shaky at best and there are too many jump cuts in these scenes. Even then, none of the action is memorable or entertaining. It's just uninspired visual noise. The costume designs and makeup look okay, but their nothing special. The cinematography does feature some really good shots, but it also has some of the most choppy use of slow motion I have ever seen. Also, there is a scene near the climax that legitimately made my head spin and not because it was thrilling. The musical score is not the best in the world, but at least it is pretty decent. They fit the set pieces nicely and it is mostly pleasant to listen to while you are listening to it.Artemis Fowl is a horrendous sci-fi adventure flick on its own right and I doubt that it is any better as an adaptation of the novel. I know that this was made for kids, but that is not an excuse for this movie be as bad it is. It sucks because I would like to see more action-adventure films that are made for younger audiences, but they also deserve something a lot better than this. If you are looking for a live-action blockbuster film that the whole family can enjoy, skip this movie and there are much better options such as The Jungle Book remake, Detective Pikachu, Chronicles of Narnia, Sonic the Hedgehog or the National Treasure films. Those are all much better than this. Between this and Cats, I think it is safe to say that Judi Dench should probably fire her agent.",

You ruined the Percy Jackson books by Rick Riordan as well.\nNothing nice to say - you've wasted your money making this horrific nightmare. Did you even include Eion Colfer?!?!",

The producers even a cast a young boy as Artemis Fowl, a role he never got to play. Colfer said he still sees him around and he is now a grown man.Disney hired Kenneth Branagh as director to bring the film to the big screen. After all he appeared as a villain in one of the Harry Potter films and directed the first Thor movie for Marvel. Instead the film has gone to Disney' streaming channel.Young Artemis Fowl is a 12-year-old Irish genius who needs to rescue his father who has been taken by a fairy. His wealthy father has been accused of stealing artefacts and the fairy wants to recover the precious Aculos.With the help of bodyguard Domovoi Butler, a dwarf and a fairy. Artemis Fowl goes off to rescue his father and comes across a magical city of fairies, trolls and dwarves.This is a fast moving action film, with good special effects but it is also rather sloppy and haphazard. I sense Branagh's finished version was gutted by the producers.Having its theatrical release delayed and then dropped in a streaming service, I doubt this will become the next Harry Potter franchise.",

My kids disliked it because it \"ruined the books.\" I disliked it because it felt like a paint by numbers Disney adventure with horrible (gravelly?) voiceover narration by Josh Gad. In trying to make something for everyone, they made something for nobody. When Artemis called himself a \"criminal mastermind\" towards the end, we all literally laughed. Nothing about this film established his character or the story. Instead, we were told about everything...the world, the people, why it mattered. Show don't tell is rule #1, and this movie broke it.

LAZY WRITING).The film is simply confusing, too fast, the young Artemis Fowl certainly has the correct surname and I honestly can't see how this would appeal to kids or adults because it is simply terrible from start to finish and I do wonder if Judi Dench and Colin Farrell are kicking themselves for appearing in such a low point to their careers.No care for the characters especially Fowl, acting terrible, story makes no sense and is too quick and could have been easily been a series and not a film but most disappointing for me was the sheer lack of understanding toward the target audience, doesn't appeal to either kids or adults so.....Rating 2 out of 10",

If that is the case, how do we explain \"Artemis Fowl\"? A film so spectacularly awful, so incompetently arrived at, that it's actually impressive how bad it is.I normally put a synopsis in my second paragraph - but this might prove difficult. Artemis Fowl (Ferdia Shaw) is a gifted young man, whose father Artemis Fowl Sr (Colin Farrell) is kidnapped by an unknown assailant. The captor then demands that young Fowl locates and provides The Aculos a powerful . . . thing. Meanwhile the fairie kingdom sends Holly Short (Lara McDonnell) to . . get the Aculos as well . . I think. The movie does a really bad job of explaining what people's motivations are.So yes, it's all a bit of a shambles. The performances aren't bad, on the whole, although Judi Dench is miscast. (Speaking of which, she really needs new representation. \"Cats\", then this, then \"Blithe Spirit\" you'd say it was deliberately trying to ruin her, if you didn't know better). The kids, Fredia Shaw and Lara McDonnell, are good - which is often not the case with a film like this. But the problem is the story. I haven't read any of the books, so I have no axe to grind in a \"they changed this\" type of way. I just don't understand what's going on - it's not explained in a way that makes it possible to follow it. I was expecting a world hopping teenage James Bond type adventure, but it barely leaves the single set. I wanted a smart crime thriller, but for kids, but instead I got a jumbled mess of half thought out ideas and bad CGI.It's the worst thing I've seen on Disney plus so far, even worse than \"A Wrinkle in Time\".",

This makes a mockery of the grading system in truth.Granted I am not the target age group for a Movie of this type but having so little respect for younger viewers causes its own problems down the line.Quite simple IMHO it was the worst pile that has ever come out of Disney in quite a time and signifies the deeply cynical nature of young adult entertainment today. It bore no relation to the trailers that preceded it and appeared to be glued together in a rush.Finally to those who are trying to raise the grade of this movie for whatever reason, possible inspired by money or the Disney corporation , just stop, it won't work.

I guess they needed an easier transitional plot to introduce Opal?3) What were they thinking when they adapted Butler? He is literally called Butler in the majority of the books, since part of his training was making his first name a secret.4) Artemis is not vulnerable like this movie portrays. He is calm, cunning, and calculating.5) Why is Mulch so large and why is that made part of his character insecurity? It has literally NOTHING to do with the story.6) The thing with Holly's dad? Why did they create that? The ENTIRE point of the oak tree was for the ritual to recharge her magic, and was the only reason Artemis was able to capture and keep her. And that stupid device to somehow block her magic?7) They made the entire movie about a device that wasn't in the first book, let alone ever in the Fowl's manor.8) With the troll part and with Butler dying and being brought back, I understand they needed something more cinematically climactic than what happened in the book.9) Why did they bring Juliet into the first movie?I understand making some changes for movies, but they took too much creative license with this.

I like Holly Short better and her opening scene with Josh Gad is actually fun. The magical underworld is a cross between near futurism and steam punk. I like the premise but some of the execution is less than magical. From the MIB suits to the derivative take on Irish magic, this movie lacks the imagination needed to elevate it.

            "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)One of the most delayed movies ever, Artemis Fowl, went through severe production issues. Its plans started in 2001 (!), and only almost twenty years later it's being released... in a streaming service. Several directors and writers passed through this project, but Kenneth Branagh, Conor McPherson, and Hamish McColl are the poor souls that decided to stick around. I'm not going to extend this review more than what it needs to. This is one of the worst films Disney has ever released, live-action or animated!I have no knowledge of the source material, so I can't give my opinion about if it's loyal to it or not. However, I can write that it's a shocking, genuinely horrible adaptation of a book saga that I know holds an immense fandom. I'm so baffled at how bad this is that I don't even know where to start. I absolutely despise criticizing young kids' performances, especially when it comes to debuts like Ferdia Shaw's. But, in this case, I can't avoid it. I feel extremely sorry for Shaw, but his performance is truly embarrassing, not only due to his emotionless, bland expressions, but also the cinematography and editing.Shaw spends the whole movie simply reading his line, and waiting for someone else to feed him the next one. I hate to write this, but it's one of the worst debuts from a young actor I've ever seen. Nevertheless, it's not all Shaw's fault. The script is atrocious in every level, and for some reason, Haris Zambarloukos (DP) and Matthew Tucker (editor) keep the camera on the kid for way too long. Throughout the whole runtime, Shaw finishes his line, and the camera stays on him for extra seconds, waiting for the late cut, while Shaw's flawed acting is vulnerable.The screenplay and the lack of a coherent story are the worst aspects of all, though. As someone who had no idea about who Artemis Fowl was, how the worlds of humans and fairies worked, and what the rules of this fictional universe were, I ended the film confused and blown away by the messy structure. Josh Gad (Mulch Diggums) spends the entire movie narrating the events with the most awkward, growly voice, and Judi Dench (Commander Root) follows the same strategy. The amount of heavy-handed exposition brutely forced into these ninety-four minutes is absurd for a flick supposed to start a new film saga.Every single line of dialogue resembles some sort of announcement like new information has been discovered, even when it's not. The narrative structure is chaotic and tries to compact so much world-building that it's impossible to care for a single storyline or character. For the first half of the movie, I had no clue what it was about. There's a massive MacGuffin at the center of everything, a villain (?) who the film tells nothing about, and so many subplots jumbled together in a desperate attempt at making the whole movie make sense.The editing is choppy as hell, the action sequences are hilariously bad with surprisingly dated CGI, and even the score (which might be the only decent component of this whole thing) makes a few scenes even worse. There's also a side story featuring Lara McDonnell (Officer Short) that's also poorly explored, but it's far more captivating than anything remotely close to Artemis. The latter is such an uninteresting character, one who I didn't care for a single second. I honestly can't figure out how Disney was able to put this out.Artemis Fowl is one of the worst feature films Disney has ever created, without a single doubt. There's absolutely no redeeming quality about it. As much as it hurts me to write this, Ferdia Shaw delivers one of the worst young performances I've ever witnessed, but the embarrassment is shared by everyone involved in this atrocious mess of a movie. It's genuinely baffling how bad it is. It holds an appalling screenplay, packed with annoyingly explicit exposition, ridiculous voice-over (sorry Josh Gad), and an excruciatingly massive amount of information that couldn't be fit in a three-hour runtime, let alone such a short one like this. No storyline is explored nor executed properly, no character is close to being remotely interesting, every action sequence is a visual disaster, and the attempts at comedy fall incredibly flat. Technically, it's as shameful as the rest: choppy editing, flawed cinematography, and surprisingly cheap VFX. The only minor positive might be Lara McDonnell, whose performance I think is pretty decent, but I cannot recommend this colossal misfire.Rating: F",

            "content": "Artemis Fowl is a 2020 sci.fi movie based off the Eoin Colfer novels and stars Judi Dench,Colin Farrell and Josh Gad,featuring Feacha Shaw as the title charcther.\nThe film begins with a mysterious guy who looks like Hagrid from Harry Potter (Josh Gad sporting a Batman accent) and a young boy\nnamed Artemis Fowl Jr(Shaw) teams up with fairies to help him find his father Artemis Fowl Sr(Colin Farrell) who was kidnapped by a mysterious figure (who we never see their face btw).The cinematography is very good but the rest I couldn't wrap my head around it. And it's from the same director Kenneth Branagh who also directed Cinderella(2015) which is my favourite Cinderella adaptation,Thor and Murder On The Orient Express. So I found it very disappointing. The newcomer as Artemis Fowl was so bland he just wasn't likeable. The film's teaser wasnt even like the film as there was a banshee in the teaser,and none in the final production.Go watch Cinderella or any other film instead of this. Nonsi Anozie who played the captain in Cinderella also stars in this.",

            "review_title": "A Really Bad Waste of Time",
            "content": "This film was meant to be released to cinema around this time but due to the pandemic Disney decided to put it on there streaming service Disney+ so here is my review for Artemis Fowl. The premise of the film sees a young man have to hunt down a secret society of fairies in order to locate his missing father.Main Character\nYoung actor Ferdia Shaw plays the titular character and I don't want to be to harsh but he is not good in this film. He is such a bland character and you are literally given no reason to care at all, that is due to the poor pacing of the film but also due to his performance which isn't inspired at all. It takes all the interesting parts of the character from the book and waters them down to make him a really boring character.Supporting Characters\nJosh Gad has a pretty big role here and he did a good job here, not his best work but he is the most entertaining character here and the one who looks like he actually wants to be there and wants to try and make the film decent. Nonso Anozie does a decent job here too, we don't learn much about him but he has some moments to shine. Now onto the rest of the cast, Lara Mcdonell is here as a fairy and I didn't really care for her as a character, she doesn't get much development and the performance didn't do anything to stand out for me. Colin Farrell is in this film and he tries but he has nothing to work with and he is wasted here making it more frustrating to why he was even cast in this role in the first place. Then we get to Dame Judi Dench and wow she is terrible here, she has some weird Irish accent and has the worst dialogue imaginable to make this easily one of the worst performances that she has ever given.Story\nThe story is so chopped up that you won't care about anything. First of all there is no indication as to really why Artemis is so intelligent and why exactly everything is going on, you are given no reason to care about anybody here and the plight that they are in. The issue is that with this film being rushed out I feel like plenty of scenes were left out which included character development scenes but they are not here and the film just makes no sense at times with a cringeworthy sequel bait ending which will never be followed up on.Script\nThe script here is really poor, there is no humour and the drama is really weak as I said earlier which makes you not care about any of the characters. The screenplay is really poorly written and deserves all of the crticism that it gets.Style\nThe style has some okay action sequences and some of the designs are good to see and have real potential. But the CGI doesn't always hold up and makes this film feel like it was from the 90's instead of 2020. The pacing of this film is also awful, it clocks in at 90 minutes and with the rush it feels like you learn nothing and aren't given a reason to remember this film.Overall\nOverall, this film is a waste of time. This film was clearly meant to be a start of a franchise but it won't be because it is a terrible film that had potential but was executed poorly and is not worth a watch.Rating - 2/10.",

The acting is pretty bad and at points it was just literally laughing out loud on how incredibly unrealistic some characters were (Judi Dench, come on! Even you can do much better!).

It's literally directed like a recap at the beginning of an episode of a fantasy TV show.It jumps from random poorly-developed scene that goes nowhere to random poorly-developed scene that goes nowhere and often times jumping among characters that for most of the movie seem to be unrelated.The whole setup is one of those unrealistic and lame kids rule movies where young children concoct and execute complex plots to accomplish some epic goal like saving the world.Setting that aside, the characters are very poorly written and inconsistent. The fairies are supposed to be a highly organized no-nonsense unbendable militant society that seems to control all of the other Tolkienesque races but theyre often cracking one-liners in the job. The main girl fairy soldier also repeatedly disobeys direct orders from high command and pretty much does whatever she wants. Yeah, real disciplined force you got there...Josh Gad plays some guy who looks like Hagrid but is a hardened and confident trickster criminal. Its a childish and weak portrayal. Strange he decided to break out of character acting this late in his career. He usually plays a nervous and awkward guy.He keeps making 80s references throughout the movie. Now that is WEIRD to me. Is there some reason for that? The 80s happened like 40 years ago. Does Disney think its mostly grandparents who are going to watch this with their grandchildren? The parents of the children who seem to be the target demographic for this would be in their early 40s or something. Probably too young to remember the 80s. The books are from the early noughties... really cant figure it out.Ohh and two black characters are introduced, talked up, and only on screen for like 5 minutes. Smooth guys. We still doing the token thing in 2020. Why have them at all if youre going to do it like that.Terrible movie and quite boring. Maybe some people will like the effects. Personally i hate CGI.Honourable Mentions: Matilda (1996). I briefly wondered if all movies geared toward preteens were this poorly made. Then I remembered Matilda. That movie is great.

            "review_title": "The most embarrassing, convoluted, and downright shameful adaptation of a popular young person's novel since A Wrinkle In Time",
            "content": "Artemis Fowl is a fantasy adventure film based on the series of books for young adults by Eoin Colfer. Directed by Kenneth Branagh (Henry V, Hamlet, Murder On The Orient Express, Thor), it is an inconsistent, chaotic mess on a scale not seen for quite some time.On the Irish coast, 12-year-old prodigy Artemis Fowl Jr. (Ferdia Shaw) lives with his father Artemis Fowl Sr. (Colin Farrell), a famous businessman who harbours a large collection of stolen artefacts in their family's estate. One day, Artemis Sr. is kidnapped by a mysterious hooded figure and held to ransom for three days until he hands over the \"Aculos\", a powerful item that when wielded properly, will allow the user access to several magic abilities. With time quickly running out, Artemis Jr., along with his faithful butler Dom (Nonso Anozie), a fairy named Holly (Lara McDonnell), and an oversized dwarf named Mulch (Josh Gad) work together to recover the Aculos before a war between different species can break out.As I have never read any of the novels from which it was based on, I can only view this film purely from an outsider's perspective. With that in mind, \"Artemis Fowl\" comes across as aggressively punishing towards any newcomers to the source material. From the very beginning, I was scratching my head as to what perplexed the filmmakers into thinking this screenplay was perfectly alright to greenlight in its current state. Rather than take the opportunity to gradually ease the audience into the world of its title character, the entire film feels like a rushed attempt to start a new franchise that the ever growing Disney empire will milk for its money's worth. This is evident in the blatant sequel-bait ending that apparently promises to fill in the crucial gaps that this one did not bother with in the first place. According to some post-viewing research, this adaptation has been in development since 2001 and encompasses elements from the first two of eight currently published novels. Additionally, the author described the original book as \"Die Hard with fairies\" which sounds like it could have been an amusing combination to see on screen. What we have gotten instead is the most embarrassing, convoluted, and downright shameful adaptation of a popular young person's novel since 2018's A Wrinkle In Time.It took me by surprise to see that a director as talented as Kenneth Branagh was at the helm of this steaming pile of garbage. Several decades ago, Branagh made great film adaptations of classic Shakespeare plays like Henry V and Hamlet, so for him to sink as low as being associated with this monstrosity is quite painful to see. His choices in quick cutting between the humans on the surface and the fairies in their underground city made it near impossible to feel any real connection to which world the audience should be siding with. A sense of moral ambiguity over what side has the right to wield the powerful artefact would have made for a nice driving force to the plot had it been handled correctly. There is no such plot device to be seen here so if the filmmakers didn't bother to invest in something like this, then why should we care?Speaking of not caring, there wasn't a single character I actually felt any emotional attachment to. Although, I will admit I think the young newcomer Ferdia Shaw, grandson of Robert Shaw (who played the shark hunter Quint in Jaws), did the best he could in the lead role despite his minimal screentime. That's right, the namesake character has a low amount of time on screen despite his name literally being what the movie is called! On the other hand, Colin Farrell feels like he's only in this film because there seems to be an unwritten law nowadays that if your film is set in Ireland and has Irish characters in it, he needs to be cast in some type of role, no matter how significant. However, the prize for looking most like they didn't want to be in this film goes to Judi Dench. The otherwise dignified actress looks bored as she unenthusiastically reads her lines in a croaky voice while wearing colourful outfits. I wished she would have taken the time to ham things up a bit to keep her performance interesting as it could have made for some funny and even redeeming moments but instead she remains poker faced throughout the whole thing.As I mentioned earlier, I have not read any of the original books so I am no sure how accurate this adaptation is but from what I have seen, it does a huge disservice to the series and fans definitely have every right to be angry. It seems in an effort to please everyone, this film pleases no one. The fact that Disney actually thought an entire franchise could have been started here is laughable, as no sane person would want to sit through another one of these films again, whether it is streamed online or viewed at the cinema. Take it from me - your time is way more valuable than that.I rate it 2/10",

Now decide for yourself if that's the best idea you've had. Have you been drinking? You've probably been drinking.Gone is the calculating genius Artemis Fowl, so physically scrawny that he can barely climb a ladder without hurting himself and speaking like an adult to the extent that he creeps people out. Gone is Artemis as a criminal mastermind arranging for the kidnapping of a fairy for ransom.Instead, this Artemis has no idea that he's from a line of criminals. His FATHER is the one who believes in fairies, in fact, and he despite being a genius (he cloned a goat when he was 10!) he doesn't learn that his father is rumored to be a master thief until he hears about it on the news. Butler (who is now very insistent that he be called \"Domovoi\" or \"Dom\" and never be called \"Butler\") ends up being the one to tell him about the world of fairies and his father's research! He's also quite athletic and engages in two fight scenes.The plot about the ransom is mutilated through the kidnapping of Fowl Sr. and the addition of a new MacGuffin stolen from the fairies that Opal Koboi (who wears a veil and voice changer through the entire movie) wants to destroy humanity. LEPrecon is involved in the search for it as well, so the entire kidnapping plot is just a sort of misunderstanding now.There's strong evidence of massive changes to the plot; narration by Mulch Diggums (a rasping Josh Gad imitating Hagrid) as a framing device is necessary to keep it from being utterly incomprehensible, and there are still so many unexplained events and reveals of knowledge that it feels like vital scenes are simply missing, or that the same scene shot with two different scripts was badly stitched together. At one point you can see Opal's mouth just enough to tell that the actress was saying something entirely different in her monologue and has been dubbed over.The characters are almost all nothing like their book counterparts. The scene of Butler (now joined by Action Artemis) fighting off the LEPrecon squad is shot and edited in a nauseating way with extreme ramping and bizarre choices of angles and violations of physics that make it seem like something from Spy Kids. There are questionable choices regarding CGI and green screen. I'm still not entirely sure how the ending actually occurred.This movie feels like it was made out of spite, out of hatred for the Fowl fandom. It's so bad of an adaptation that it can only be deliberate sabotage.",

I mean, I would love to watch a fantasy movie with an eleven year old Bond villain as the protagonist-- but that doesn't happen here, because it's illegal to make your main character even the least little bit unlikable in a Disney movie, I guess.And is it just me or does this movie feel dated? It has a weird SPY KIDS feel combined with a few aesthetics lifted from HARRY POTTER. It feels like something that should have come out in 2003, not 2020.I'm only giving this a two instead of a one because there was one genuinely good joke in the movie, delivered by Josh Gad when he's being sent to prison. He gets read his crimes and he says deadpan, \"Yeah, that's about right,\" which did get a chuckle out of me.

It felt very wooden with no real emotion behind it and lines were delivered in a monotone way. You could tell they were trying to sound sincere but it came across as unnatural delivery, as if they were just regurgitating learned dialogue (which they obviously were but they way they spoke the lines sounded like the were reading them from an autocue).\nYou also never really get the sense that Artemis is this criminal mastermind he's constantly proclaiming himself to be as he doesn't really do anything to earn that grandiose title.\nRecommended?

It's like Avatar the last airbender adaptation all over again. They hired a CHILD to play Holly Short. A freaking child! There are too many things wrong with this movie to go into it all, but the biggest let down was the whole \"let's invent our own take on these characters\". They COMPLETELY changed Root. There is no cigar, there is no yelling, there is no him turning red... oh, and he's a she now with a raspy voice and not very mobile either... like that heck? Why would you ruin such great characters? Butler is being called BY HIS REAL NAME the whole time and his little sister doesn't have her iconic braid with the metal ring. Oh, and they are not Eurasian either. He's a black dude with pale blue eyes and white hair. And he's not buff, he's just chubby. The Mulch... omg it's Olaf from Frozen. He was big and looked human and the hair was weird... omg... like why? Why would you RUIN such great characters? Don't get me started on Artemis. He had a British accent throughout the whole film and he is into sports and likes surfing? And he's into martial arts now too lol like he doesn't have Butler for that. The acting was shallow, the story was fast paced, a LOT of scenes from the trailer were missing. Nothing was explained, like the fairy book with their rules, Holly short is played by a child. She acts like one too, screaming at the top of her lungs topside. She's a fraking special forces cop officer person and she's going woohoo when she's flying in front of humans?! She's a trained professional for crying out loud, not a kid... anyhow, there are a LOT of things wrong with the movie. It's a horrible adaptation and it's bad for new fans too. It got worse and worse as it progressed. It was heart breaking to watch.

            "content": "So imagine my surprise to find that this mess was directed by Kenneth Branagh. I expected them to be one of those woke 13 year olds fighting to make a mark in the big bad world who won't acknowledge their nonexistent accomplishments. I have no idea who Artemis Fowl is and, after seeing this film, I still don't. I wanted to complain that if they're going to make a movie about Irish Celtic mythology, why not get some good Irish people to do the job? And they did! Writers and directors and a lot of the lead actors are Irish or maybe Scottish. More McPeople than I've ever seen in one place. And it felt like a McDonalds meal. You mucked it all up! You failed in expressing your own culture, you did!The only positive in the film are the visuals. They are quite well done. And the cast, if one can call it an achievement, since many of the actors in that cast are misused or not used and simply put there to attract people in the cinemas. The joke is on them. I mean, look at this: illustrious director - check, stars like Colin Farrell, Judi Dench and Josh Gad - check, children story from acclaimed book about hidden magical worlds - check. Beautiful girls that may become media idols in the near future like Tamara Smart and Lara McDonnell - check. Cha-ching! Nothing else deserves any attention. Characterization, none. Story, none. Feeling, none. Editing: abysmal - those guys should be fired.Why does the black guy have blue eyes? Why is Juliet in the film at all? Why is a world of technomagical fairies that live centuries and have a skeleton key to the universe afraid of the human world? Why can't we even see the face of the villain or know anything about her other than she is mad humans make fun of fairies? None of that is explained in any satisfactory manner. And the main character? An annoying kid who has not acted in ANYTHING before this. And it shows! The best actor in the whole movie was Lara McDonnell. She's 17! And I may have been mesmerized by her eye magic thing when saying that.Bottom line: typical Hollywood condescendence for viewers when making children's movies. I mean most of the movies they make assume the viewer is an imbecile, children movies are a notch worse. And worse, it puts people off from reading the book. Even if I had any inkling of an idea to read it, that's gone now. This film makes the writer and publishers of the book lose money!",

E.g. the draf giganticus looked a lot like Hagrid... and a lot of the magical creatures looked like they stepped out of other fantasy/sf movies.\nThe cast was also good. Especially Holly is my idea of an elf and she played the role very good. The other characters are also well cast.\nThere is some criticism though. Although the story seemed to be told in the end, some parts feel rushed and cut short. Some scenes are okay, some too long and some too short.

A bunch of high school students with a $10000 budget could make something better then this.Artemis Fowl is the Anti-Hero, but Disney made him a hero. Artemis mother is sick and father kidnapped but here his mother is dead and father is still missing. Artemis is ruthless and a criminal but he is a genius and is always the smartest one in the room. Here he is a nice kid...Holly short is the ONLY female in the LepRecon division and is paving the way for others, here her commander Julius Root has been gender swopped and is also female so that basically destroys her entire story and character arcs.Butler is Eurasian and so is Juliet, here Butler and Juliet are black(I have nothing against them being black except the fact that in the books they aren't and therefore a racial swop is completed unnecessary and adds nothing to the film)Butlers first name is such a highly guarded secret and I won't say it here(I don't want to spoil it for those who don't know it yet) in the first like 5 minutes of the movie it's made public knowledge.Anyway enough of the rant, if you're here after reading the book turn away now, if you haven't read the book yet, don't start the movie just go read the book or watch something else!\nI wish I could rate this 0/10 unfortunately I can only give it a 1/10 rating.",

With its continual delays, I was able to also read through the first five books in the series. This may have helped me understand what Disney was trying to do with this, but it doesn't excuse their butchering of the source material. I can only imagine how confused people who hadn't read a single word of the books would be, and I was right on the verge with them.What gets me is that, as a fairly short book, Disney could have made a perfect adaptation in a scant two hours. Instead, they decided to cram so much \"sequel potential\" into 95 minutes to lose focus on any of the stories they were trying to adapt simultaneously. I also understand how the movie version is inclusive of all races and genders, but sometimes holding to how the characters were written in the book is the best route. After all, Judi Dench is a fine actress, but I was expecting a cigar-chomping man for Root, and not her.While there are many neat scenes in this movie, some of which are in the books, they're so disconnected that I lost interest fairly quickly. Overall, it's just kind of \"meh,\" which might also be the source material's fault. Sure, militarized and futuristic fantasy creatures is a neat idea, but if that's all there is, then that's all there is. I will give props to Disney for cutting some of the bathroom humor that the middle-grade book chose to include for humor purposes, but now they're left with another sub-par adaptation of a beloved children's book.A jumbled mess that tried to do too much in too little time, I give Artemis Fowl 2.5 stars out of 5.",

If you've never read or don't care about the books, this one should be avoided unless you're watching it with a child.Reviewing this as a nostalgic lover of the books though...just don't watch this. It's not worth the curiosity. They took the first two books, smashed them together with a hammer, blended them, and crapped out this movie, served with a huge helping of Random Unnecessary Plot McGuffin. Almost every scene is taken from one of the two books, but altered to be more confusing, dumb and frustrating than anything from Colfer. They don't really explain how anything works. Fairy magic is barely explained (or even used, other than healing), the Rules are brushed over extremely quickly and they keep alluding to the battle between fairies and humans without actually explaining what happened. Then there's the Aculos, a completely random magical device with absolutely no defined power that turns out to have been in Fowl Manor all along and Holly uses it perfectly to solve all the conflicts in the movie with no problems. And somehow thats not even the worst part. The characters are downright atrocious. Artemis isnt even a criminal (and also athletic for some dumb reason), his dad knows about faires and works with them to save the world, his mother is just dead, Holly is focused on redeeming her father who worked with Artemis' dad, Mulch is the most annoying and unneeded narrator ever, Root is decent but doesn't do much, Butler is just kind of there and Juliet and Foaly barely exist. Opal Koboi is supposedly behind everything but all you see is a shadow with a 3-pack-a-day voice who never does anything in the story besides be a totally generic villain who hardly ever is onscreen and barely interacts with the rest of the cast.

Producers should NEVER produce a movie based on a famous and loved line of books if you don't want to respect and recreate the books.I raised my sons on the Artemis Fowl books. We all loved the books.Sadly, little of the original book remains. A few names. Fairies. Maybe one scene. Otherwise, everything is different. Plot. Twists. Who knows what. Who's involved when. Endearing quirks. The two most blatant is Butler and Mulch Diggums. Butler was to be a solid serveant protector who defined the name Butler. Mulch Diggums was just the wrong size and never cleanly setup why he was the wrong size. I can forgive changing the gender of commander root, but still. This whole script was bad.A few special effects are good, but it's hard to watch because it doesn't match the treasured story.The story is rewritten and re-written poorly. The special effects seem more to have special effects. The fun quirkiness of the original story is just not there.",

            "content": "Artemis Fowl is about a young boy who is the child of the famous Artemis Fowl Senior. His dad gets kidnapped and then that sends his son sort of looking for him.I'll get right to it. This film is awful. Come on Disney, how could you? A Wrinkle In Time was bad but this was somehow worse. This is probably one of the worst films I have seen in a while.To start off, it is sooooooo boring. You think it would fill the runtime pretty well because it is only an hour and a half, but no! You never really know what is happening or what the characters are doing. That goes along with how bad the story was. They didn't even leave the house the whole film to find Artemis Fowl. They're going on a quest or something aren't they? They just had Josh Gad do voice overs for all of the character introductions which is extremely lazy. The trailer also had almost no scenes from the movie. It was like it was advertising a whole different film. I bet Disney saw how bad a lot of it was and made the director shave off half of the film. That makes me wonder how long it really is. Will people who have read the book want a directors cut? That still can't save the film from the terrible acting.The acting! Don't even get me started on the acting! The main character is atrocious! Same for all of the other characters. I bet for Collin Ferrel did this for the money. Although I don't think this film made much of anything. Judi Dench actually seemed like she cared. She did that in Cats too for I don't know what reason.The CGI was terrible as well. It looked like a kid drawing pictures of cool powers on a piece of paper for the whole film. If this film was made years ago it might even be called bad because of the CGI.Overall, Artemis Fowl showed you what it could have been but didn't take you in to see. I would recommend this film to people who are bored out of their mind and have nothing to do or people who have read the book.",

            "content": "Artemis Fowl\n2020\n12\nDirector: Kenneth Branagh\nStarring: Josh Gad, Judi Dench, Colin Farrel, Ferdia Shaw, Nonso Anonzie, Lara Mcdonnell etcOverall rating 22/100Artemis Fowl is about a young criminal prodigy who get's unintentionally sucked into a world of magic, when a race of fairies kidnap his father. This movie was just poor, with hardly anything going for it sadly it's the worst book to movie adaptation I have seen let's get started.Let's be nice and start with a couple of positives, the film's cinematography was great, and the film linked the two main characters and their friendship well. The film looked fantastic, and their was some creativity with it's shots. With all the different species explored well, so it was pleasant to look at and if you forgot about mostly everything else about the movie it had this going for it. I did also like the way they connected Artemis (Ferdia Shaw) and Holly Short (Lara Macdonnell) the fact that both of their dad's were being wrongly accused of things they haven't done was a good way to make their friendship believable and more realistic.Now for my first two negatives. There was some very odd creative decisions throughout and the film actually had fairly poor CGI in places. I thought some off the creative decisions they made in the movie really didn't work for me at all. Largely the odd on and off narration from Josh Gad when he was being questioned about Artemis Fowl, we hadn't even met his character and we had him talking over the movie and it just didn't work until the actual scene of his escape happened, the film had multiple bad and confusing creative choices that didn't work.My next negatives would be the lack of character background, the film being overstuffed with characters with no development and the lack of connection with the relationships. The movie just expected you to know the characters and what they do before they even explained it, for people who haven't read the books, they would want to get to know the characters as they would be new to them so this was poor. The film also had way to many characters with practically no background or development just the basic role within the film. Because of the previous two negatives I didn't have any connection with most of the relationships throughout. I didn't really believe or connect with the father and son relationship between Artemis and his dad (Colin Farrell) it just felt awkward and forced which is not something that should happen with family relationships within the film. I also felt emotional disconnect with the characters. Because of my lack of connection to the father and son dynamic it was very hard for me to feel bad for Artemis about his father or even when they reunited. And when the butler (Nonso Anonzie) died I didn't feel any emotion at all because I knew practically nothing about his character.My final two positives would be the decent amount of character background and information about Artemis at the beginning and the performances from Josh Gad and Judi Dench. When they actually spent some time giving us background on Artemis and a bit of development it was appreciated. We learned about Artemis and his personality and how he doesn't fit in at school because of the bad image his father has, it made you understand his character a little bit more, I also appreciated the performances and the character work done by Josh Gad and Judi Dench. Two professional and good actors, we will get into the negative performances shortly. Both their characters were very likeable, and they both went all out with their performances which was really appreciated and showed how professional and experienced they both are, which in a weird way made them out of place in the film.My next two negatives would be the bad performances and how generic the movie was. I really felt like most of the performances within the film were either bad or just seemed like the actors didn't really care. No offense to Ferdia Shaw as this is his first professional role and I partly blame the script but he was terrible as the main character. His inexperience was obvious, he was awkward to watch and always looked like he was waiting for everyone to finish their lines, even Lara's performance as Holly felt slightly amateurish. Plus the movie was so generic and predictable it took a lot of the fun out of it. You knew what was going to happen at the end. And some of the choices were so obvious it was just bad, and the Artemis's story of not fitting in and having a lost parent has been done so many times before, the plot just lacked creativity and uniqueness.My next negatives would be the rushed pacing, inconsistent storytelling, and tonal issues with poor attempts at humour. The film felt completely rushed and never settled on one particular thing. It just felt like it was constantly changing its mind about the plot, and the film just needed to be longer in order to flesh and further develop the plot and at least some of the characters. The storytelling was also inconsistent and messy, we spent more time in the fairy world then actually focused on the main characters, this was frustrating as this was also just poor worldbuilding as they didn't spend an equal amount of time fleshing out both worlds. There was some severe tonal issues as well, they were trying to add normal things from the world we live in into a movie about goblins and fairies and it just didn't work I found all the pop culture references irritating and out of place. These were largely the films attempts at humour and for me it just didn't work.My next two negatives would be the poor script and the underwhelming reveal. The whole script for me just felt very poorly put together and to be honest fairly lazy. The plot was generic, the characters within the script were poorly fleshed out, and the film just felt like it needed a few more drafts as for me this was not up to the standard of what the film should have been. Also, the underwhelming reveal of the object that Artemis needed to find was disappointing. The fact that the movie made such a big deal about finding an artefact for the villain so he could save his dad only for it to be in the house was for me a lazy creative choice. And made parts of the movie a complete waste of time.My final negatives would be the poor villains, underusage of characters and poorly trying to set up a sequel. The villains of the film first of all were hardly involved, and when they were they never really posed a threat at all which considering what they were up against was incredibly disappointing. Sometimes not knowing anything about a villain's past or what they look like is a good thing but sadly not in this case. And in general, there was just a lot of underused characters, especially Artemis's dad which was a shame as it made him be less important despite him being the one who inspired Artemis. And finally, the film really lazily set up for a sequel. I hope this doesn't get a sequel, I knew all the thing they were going to say they still needed to do, and due to my disconnect to the movie I just didn't care that much.Overall Artemis Fowl looked amazing, but apart from that was a poor movie. That just felt inconsistent, generic and rushed. And sadly, should not be the start of a new franchise.",

But since this flopped HARD I doubt there would even be another one). And they have the most annoying cast ever, I really like Josh Gad but I don't understand why he was even narrating this dumpster fire. Lara McDonnell as Holly Short is just awful, her character looks like if one of the bugs from Best Fiends was sent to radioactive laboratory and was genetically modified with Young Mary Katherine from Epic (2013). Overall, this film is really confusing. Stay away from this and just watch The Falcon and the Winter Solider it's hundred times better than this sorry state of a movie.

But hey each to their own. I was anticipating a disaster but instead got a great sci-fi fantasy film with cool CGI, characters and easy enough to follow story.Honestly I didn't expect it to be remotely good based on the writers past material, but I was very impressed. At a breezy 95min it delivered pure fun entertainment and judging by the end I darn well hope there'd better be more!!Kenneth Branagh directed this thing better than I imagined.

His father gets kidnapped by a hooded guy and he needs the powerful \"Aculos\" inorder to return Artemis Fowl Sr(Colin Farrell). But soon,he has to face the powerful underground fairies who has connection with the Aculos and the missing of his father.Firstly,some of the visuals in this movie are great. That's it.To sum it up,this movie was pretty bad. They had a good source material and didn't even utilize a bit. There wasn't any story in this actually,the movie starts and within a few minutes,the whole movie is set up, there's no tension,the pacing is bad, everything happens so quick and you won't even see any character development in it. This movie is only 95 minutes long and they accomplish nothing in it. The acting was bad,some of the costumes were bad and there's no emotion in this movie. There are several movies where there's no character development or story,but, we'll be atleast entertained. Sadly,this movie is not entertaining.Overall,as I said,this is a bad movie, maybe if they spent more time in development or increased the runtime with more content,it might've been alot better.

The grotesk colors, \"technologies, cinematographia, costume design and so on, gave me already in the first minutes the impression: this movie isn't meant to be a serious movie. It wants to be light family entertainment.So I watched it exactly with this premise and the movie didn't really disappointed. Yeah, it is a bit boring, but which movie which is appropriate for smaller children isn't?Does that make the movie a masterpiece? Nope for sure not. But it isn't as inherently bad as most people want you to believe. It is almost an injustice to rate this movie as bad as many have done.If you have a family with young children and want to watch something, which is totally innocent, but also kinda contemporary... this is the movie for you... for others: just pass this one!",

Judi Dench looks like she doesn't even know why she is there or what she is saying. The only actor that put in a decent performance was the one playing Holly Short. The other performances are average at best, with some being a bit over the top and distracting. There was one moment at the end of the film where Colin Farrell seems to changes seats in the helicopter 3 or 4 different times, which to me is a cardinal sin when you are making a big blockbuster movie costing millions of dollars. The worst part of all is that the author Eoin Colfer actually was happy with the movie and had some say in it even though it barely resembles his books. Disney is really scraping the bottom of the barrel to bring out new content for their streaming service.I don't even know where to start with the stupid changes from the book that just cause distractions....\nA 12 year old criminal mastermind who only ever wears a suit becomes a 12 year old whining boy who likes to surf\nA highly trained bodyguard who never reveals his real name unless he is dying as that is part of his training, has everyone call him by his real name, and cries a lot\nThe bodyguards 18 year sister who has been through the same training as him, becomes his 12 year old niece who runs around screaming in terror the whole time even though she is trained in all sorts of martial arts\nCommander Root changes from a grumpy old man who doesn't think a female elf should be part of LEP-Recon to a caring grumpy old woman\nHolly Short becomes a over-emotional teenage fairy\nAnd that's just the main ones I can remember in my state of disbelief at the badness of this film",

At least the Wizarding World is able to sustain eight movies across a viable franchise. I've never read the Artemis Fowl series, I only know them through osmosis, but it has a series of books, a solid fan base and franchise potential bubbling just beneath the surface, but based on this stinker, fat chance of that happening. It feels a like there's at least half an hour missing from the movie, which sits at an hour and half length, rather surprising, considering the state of recent blockbusters, and the usual length of Kenneth Branagh's filmography. At least he's got Patrick Doyle in his back pocket doing a rather good score. On the side is some good costumes, production design and a tease at an interesting magical world, but that's pretty much it; everything else had all the fun sucked out. It has kids who kind of act in it, except when they can't, sometimes in the exact same scene. Josh Gad pops in as discount Hagrid, doing a mumbly, gravely voice that feels like he's trying to impersonate a grizzled detective in a crime show. Then Judi Dench pops in doing her McGruff the crime dog imression, and then the villain pops in who talks like he's using the voice modulator from the Scream movies. All I could think of when he was talking was, \"Do you like scary movies, Artemis?\" The grating voice narration takes up half the movie, and felt like Christian Bale's Batman got caught in the throat of a hippo. I guess I'm not supposed to be laughing when a dark elf in a Emperor Palpatine robe and hoodie is talking into a magical iPhone, reading off dialogue that sounds like what a six year old would say to sound cool. Thanks for wasting a good premise Disney. At least you can go down in history as having one of the most boring, unexciting finales ever. It's flat like my soda, with some bland CGI on the side. All the fans of the book seemed to be up in arms and hated the trailer, and the movie as well, now I know why.

The way everything was shot, the effects, all of it was fun and aestetic. The acting was not horrible. I normally hate on Josh Gad a lot because he seems to be very \"Look at me! I'm funny! Laugh!!!\" and it's annoying, but here, he delivers the funny lines so deadpan, and that's what makes it funny. (Though, I'm not sure what was with his Batman voice) It seems genuine, as opposed to trying to be funny. Also, not a single curse word the entire movie, and no underlying agenda of any kind. It was just entertainment. The exposition was a bit rushed. (20 minutes in, and they're still giving us information, and a lot of it), but that was really the only issue. Grade: B 8/10 4/5 stars",

Thought the girl who plays Holly was very good. My kids favorite!",

            "content": "I loved the movie, because I saw it as a child, without expecting anything at all. A child whose heroes were on the screen, like that time you saw Santa Claus on the tv.It was severely flawed, on not being able to make audience feel what they should feel on each situation, by developing an extremely superficial fast-paced tornado of a confusing altered plot.But I watched it with my inner child, the one who doesn't judge if it's father who puts the beard on and the red hat to give me presents.This movie is a gift, and I'm grateful for it. I'll watch it happily until I get the remake.Hope my review helps.I gave it a 10/10 for the feelings I have felt when I watched the movie, as a fan of the Artemis Fowl series of books who waited for 20 years for this. Objectively, I would give the movie a 7/10 being kind, and a 4/10 being mean. 7 would be just right though.The thing is, the real problem with the movie is it's too fast paced. They tried to push two and a half books into one movie and they were way too rich to do it this way. Other than that, the plot is way different and some of the characters are way out of character, which makes it hurtful for less understanding fans, which is not my case.But you've probably have read too many rants and hate towards the movie, so I will state the very brilliant points of it, which makes it a great movie despite its flaws.1) The actings are fantastic, all of them. Despite the screenplay which made them feel out of character, they did an amazing job with what they had.2) The visuals are marvelous. I absolutely couldn't have expected anything better, and it exceded my expectations entirely and by far. I am very happy with what I saw. Wonderful science fiction visuals.3) Make up and the clothing was brilliant. I can't ask for anything better.4) Cinematography and photography is amazing.5) As a fan of AF, I watched it as a \"parallel universe\", since it was different to the real (and much better) plot of the books, and was satisfied with the altered plot.Now the 3 main flaws which made the movie be a 4 star movie instead of a decent 8 star one:1) Extremely fast paced that pushes way too many interesting things in seconds, so nobody can fully immerse on this new fairy world thus making something otherwise brilliant feel superficial and lame2) A screenplay favoring out of character acting3) Ok, I'll say it. The book plot was tremendously better.I really enjoyed watching a decent movie of my main childhood book series and I'll watch it at least 20 more times this week. I hope on some miracle there comes a second one -or even better: a remake.",

Why this was done is beyond me, as the original book was cinematic in nature, although everything that made the book interesting and cinematic was thrown out the door in this movie. Not even the characters were spared -- with massive changes made to their appearances, ages, personalities, and living situations.I used to think the Divergent film franchise was as large as you could deviate from your source material, but Artemis Fowl has proven me wrong. Whoever wrote this screenplay clearly has an enormous ego that led them to believe they had the talent to completely dismantle the source material and that fans would enjoy it.

            "content": "Who do you think you are?\nI'm the next criminal mastermind.I'm afraid you need to be as intelligent as \"Artemis Fowl\" to understand and keep up with this movie. What a confusing chaos this was. I get it that they are looking for a sort of Harry Potter successor and already started drooling while thinking of the box-office with every new sequel. But they should have spread this single movie over a number of sequels because now you cannot make heads or tails of it. Let me remind you that I don't know the book series written by Eoin Colfer, on which this film is based. Let alone read one of them. A kind of introduction of the characters would have been helpful for the uninitiated viewers. And that's a big difference when you compare (and there will be a lot of comparisons) this Disney film with the Harry Potter films. Even if you hadn't read one of the Harry Potter books, you were sucked into the wonderful story about this mini wizard from the start. All the leading protagonists were carefully introduced and gradually you got to know them, appreciate them, and quickly one of the leading characters became your favorite. With \"Artemis Fowl\" you better keep focused because before you know it you have missed a whole storyline and a number of important characters. The amount of facts and things of importance is so immense that it'll make you dizzy.It also took an awful lot of effort before the film could be released. The film rights were bought in 2001 by Miramax Films (in the middle of the fantasy film period when Potter and Frodo ruled). Next Disney announced in 2013 that they were going to make the film in partnership with The Weinstein Company. The creation of this feature film was very different from what had been expected. First of all, you had the disappearing trick of some directors. Then there was the Weinstein affair with Harvey waving his wand too much apparently. Next came the disgruntled fans and last but not least the Coronavirus. In the end, it was decided to stream the film on the Disney + platform instead of screening in the cinema. For sure this was the best decision they could have ever made. No one would be inclined to watch it in the cinema after reading a few reviews. Unfortunately, the revenue from Disney + platform subscriptions is not enough to bear the price tag of a sloppy $ 125 million.What else went wrong besides the fact it's a very confusing story? Well, to be honest, I wasn't really charmed by the characters themselves. Artemis Fowl Jr. (Ferdia Shaw) is an annoying kid without any charisma and totally insensitive (A kind of MIB version of Richie Rich). A deadly serious little brat with an attitude. Admittedly, his intelligence is lightyears beyond normal and he obtained a series of diplomas at a very young age. Plus he comes from a wealthy family and probably took everything for granted during his young life. The magic of a film doesn't only depend on the magic of the story itself, but also how amiable the main characters come across. No one could resist the charms of Harry Potter (I know. There's the comparison again.): that poor little fellow living under the stairs, with his roguish smile and lightning bolt on his forehead. I really didn't find Artemis that charming. And even the more famous actors made little impression. Colin Farrell had a depressed and sulky expression throughout the film as if he already saw the potential for disaster. Judi Dench was actually the only one to stand out in her green leather fairy outfit. But that was more because of the charismatic nature of her character Commandant Root. And Lara McDonell looked adorable as the brave fairy Holly Short. You also had a centaur who could join Milli Vanilli. The dwarf Mulch Diggums (Josh Gad), who also took on the role of narrator at the same time, who's actually not a dwarf and resembles Rubeus Hagrid. And there was even the suggestion David Bowie was an elf (Talking bout humor). That's about it what I can remember from all personages. In general, however, the performances were not impressive or grand.There's also something to be said about the footage. They've put a lot of energy into it (maybe a little too much) and the film is packed with generally good-looking CGI. But a film about fairies, trolls, and dwarfs, who live in an underground hidden world, must look fairy-like and enchanting to me. They've decided to create a futuristic-looking fairy world full of flashy vehicles and modern buildings. And stuffed with a bunch of extras, busy decors, and an infinite number of props that you'll need an extra pair of eyes to take in all the wonders. But don't panic. This magical place is soon abandoned. Most of the film is set in the residence of the Fowl family. And there you can expect even more CGI (slightly less well developed). Perhaps it was quite an exaggeration when you consider the number of special effects. The only thing that impressed me was the jaw joints of Mulch Diggums.No, I'm not a new fan of \"Artemis Fowl\" and I don't feel the urge to discover the books. All in all, I found this movie version confusing and chaotic. I sometimes had the feeling that I was watching a new episode of \"Kingsman\" for young viewers. I didn't fully understand the principle of the time bubble and was amazed bout how Artemis could unravel everything so quickly (But yes, extremely intelligent. Right?). Maybe me being a grownup has something to do with it. I guess youngsters will like it. Although, I think my two kids, who aren't real book readers and never heard of Artemis Fowl, will be lost after 20 minutes. A re-watch might help better understanding the whole thing. I imagine fans of the books were very curious how Fowl's world would look like on the silver screen. Anyway. I won't wait for the sequels of this vague film. To put it mildly, I think the movie \"Artemis Fowl\" is a perfect fit for the current summer vacation that has become a disaster due to COVID-19.",

Once, I actually said out loud, \"stop with the music already!\"Then, the movie is a total mess. I mean, there are SO many things going on, that it is hard to find the main point. There was no focus.The acting was not that great from some of the cast.The movie drug on and on and on. I mean, even after the thirty minute mark, I was ready to watch something else. But, I told myself that it may get better. I was wrong.The graphics were great. It looked like I was watching an A-list movie. It was a shame that such a good looking movie, was drug down but such an awful script.Honestly, I have watched so many movies in my life.

Child actors who can actually act. Intensity that is believable and not overdone. Emotions that are understated. Presence that feels real. When I saw the sunglasses I thought 'Oh no, theyr'e going for Will Smith cool and are gonna fail' How pleasantly surprising to be wrong. It works. He does not come across as a junior James Bond. Smart but not overbearing nor overconfident. Josh Gad playing Mulch Diggums stole the film. It's the antidote to missing Robbie Coltranes Hagrid.

            "content": "Let's make this clear. I'm still a kid. Or at least, I'm not yet a legal adult. More importantly, I love and openly enjoy kids movies every time, movies like Onward, How To Train Your Dragon, Sonic the Hedgehog, Christopher Robin etc. This movie is nothing like the ones I've mentioned above.This movie is a massive dumpster fire, and that's even before I add in my complaints as a book fan.First, let's talk the movie without the context of the books. I hate to say this, but Ferdia Shaw is quite unconvincing as an actor, and that's partly down to the rubbish script he was given as much as it is his wooden delivery. Secondly, the plot of this movie is everywhere except coherent. From plot point to plot point it's rushed to be \"exciting\" when instead it's just barely understandable, a blast of CGI after CGI with no real stakes or drama or proper characters who you even like. It's a mixture of B-movie cliches that takes this admittedly well-made fairy world and makes it entirely forgettable and generic. Humour falls flat just about every time. I'm going to quote Chris Stuckmann, who has not read the books, and who does routinely review movies like the aforementioned Onward and HTTYD, \"stunningly bad\". Josh Gad's narration was such a bore. The setup of this movie's world is ridiculously generic which results in a severe disinterest in the movie in of itself. The characters are equally boring.In order to have some touchstone to the book, you hear them say the line that he's a \"criminal mastermind\". Let's be clear. Artemis spends the movie being a very nonthreatening occasionally smart kid. On no occasion is the criminal angle ever brought up in a meaningful way. You can't have it both ways, this only furthers how atrocious the writing of this movie was.Let's get into the book argument. The premise of the books was that Artemis Fowl began as a criminal mastermind who did criminal things like blow up boats, kidnap and extort, and who eventually would have a redemption arc. By starting from the opposite direction, the writers have not only failed entirely to adapt the singular unique thing about Artemis Fowl, but also created an even more unconvincing arc than before. As mentioned already, the plot is everywhere and the stakes are artificially thrown everywhere and muddled to make it feel like something is happening.The reason why the Fowl books were good was also because the plotting was relatively tight and fast-paced. Two different arcs were squished into this 90 minute movie, making the plot incoherent, especially when compared to the original books.Yes, books will always have differences from movies and that's absolutely fine. But there is no real excuse for the writers. Namely because there are graphic novels of the original books. What does this mean? It means that an entire storyboard already exists. The hardest work is essentially done for you, by showing you a visual format of the plot, so it's easy to decide what you can film and what you can't. To then come up with a generic plot and the most ridiculous character arcs for a series which had good versions of both was stupid.Finally, let's address the \"it's a kids movie\" nonsense. Any five year old will enjoy a random mixture of colours and cool-looking creatures. This is NOT an excuse to make a shit movie. It's barely enjoyable, and let's face it, not even interesting enough to get you to consider watching another one. It isn't even as though Disney did families a favour by making this generic entertainment. The original was written for kids. Read by kids. Enjoyed by kids, who usually have a deeper appreciation of things like that than adults give them credit for. It makes zero sense that making Artemis Fowl slowly turn evil is somehow a better character arc for audiences than starting with an already somewhat evil Artemis. The characters don't fit, and anyway Shaw is highly unconvincing at being anything more than a wide-eyed kid with occasional smart moments.Enough with that nonsense to justify a high score. This is quite objectively still a bad movie. I would say 5/10 material, but the sheer audacity of the writers to destroy the original books so comprehensively despite it literally having received good reception from kids and families for years, makes this much lower.2/10. Don't overpraise this movie just to spite people who you think are \"haters\". It doesn't deserve that.",

Nothing about the story or its world make any sense. There was clearly a lot that was left on the cutting room floor and I'm curious as to how much Kenneth Branagh was involved in the post production process as I'm just shocked to see his name as the director. I really wanted to give the movie the benefit of the doubt, the settings look visually interesting and I like the concept. I thought that maybe it was building to some big pay off, alas I was deceived, nothing happens at all, at least nothing I care about. Even despite the editing, this script is an absolute nightmare. No clarity to who or what is happening. Josh Gad gives a laughable performance as being the film's narrator/expository guide and it's just awful to listen to with his offbeat voice. The cast is full of very talented people and none of them make an impact. Judi Dench gives possibly the worst performance I've ever seen from her and that's saying something when you've seen Cats. I'm fairly certain I read this first book when I was younger but I couldn't even tell you what it was about. I'm sure the series has its fans, but this is clearly not the adaptation they would want. It once again proves that YA novel adaptations need to go/or adapt as a tv series to really stretch its plot/characters more. Even though it's on streaming, I still wouldn't watch it. It's by far one of the worst films I've seen all year and don't even recommend seeing it just for how bad it is. 3/10.",

But the length was too short and thus made the whole thing a bit rushed, but it's primarily a kid's movie, so that's understandable. I look forward to any sequels.If not for all the low ratings, I would still have given it a 7. The 10 rating was to counterbalance all the sour grapes ratings of 1 and 2 from those who read the books and were disappointed with the movie.This is certainly worth an hour and a half of your time for some fast-paced and family-friendly entertainment.",

I was told it was fantasy sci-fi detective series but the detective bit was missing here. The story about exposing fairies was embarrassingly bad it all looks like your typical young adult fantasy film but without a good story, charisma, chemistry and magic the threat is not there it reminded me of wrinkle in time and the failed Golden Compass movie but worse even a bit like Jupiter ascending but worse which is crazy. It's all very bland and forgettable. This is up there with The Last Days of American Crime, Brahms, The Grudge, Gretel & Hansel and Birds of Prey for worst film of 2020.",

But older audiences will find the movie lack-lustre and left wanting. But I don't believe it's that bad to deserve a 1 or 2 star rating.But I do believe the artist playing Artemis Fowl lacks the charisma and acting talent to pull off the movie. Perhaps more experience under his belt could improve his performance. But in this reviewers eyes, he failed to deliver in this movie.But apart from that, the movie was OK (I'm over 30 yrs old).

He loves Mulch Diggums and Holly. Artemis is brimming with his usual cockiness and superiority just like the books. Butler is played exceptionally well and I cried at a certain point (if you actually gave the movie a chance you know what I'm talking about).If this is not turned into a franchise then disney is really losing out on a great story.

And Josh Gad, for some reason, makes a perfect dwarfish character !As for the story - if you don't know the books, then it is ok. It passes the time, but don't bother paying to see it.

If there were a way to leave negative stars, I would.I'm a mom of 3 sons who devoured the Artemis series. I have been waiting for this movie to bring those amazing characters to life since 2007, when I first cracked the cover of Artemis Fowl. I read them all aloud to my kids and as they grew, we've all revisited them. Compelling, funny, work with characters and dialogue that snap off the page.I'm an avid movie-goer who has loved Kenneth Branaugh's directing work since he took on Shakespeare in the 90s. He made the bard so accessible for millions of viewers. He's been knighted fergawdssake.Josh Gad is normally so amazingly funny and fun to watch. Judy Dench is an international treasure. WTAF is up with their voices. In a \"heart wrenching\" scene, Diggums grumbles,\"Listen to the two of us, grunting at each other like a pair of hippos with a throat infection\". I clapped because that's how they both sound THE. WHOLE. MOVIE.So you start with amazing source material, give it a monstrous budget, leave it in the hands of a skilled director with shining stars and WHAT HAPPENED, DISNEY?Colfer has to be hurling. If he were dead, he'd be spinning in his grave like a powerdrill.I am the first to understand that sometimes license must be taken to establish tricky plot points. I will suspend disbelief if there is a payoff that is similar to the source material. The producers of this movie, however, put the source material in a blender, pureed it, ran it through test audiences and came up with the most unwatchable pablum I've seen on the screen.Let's spoil it up:Do you ove the Angeline redemption line, whereby Artemis' mother, so distraught that her best true love is missing and presumed dead at the hands of the Russian Mafia that she walks like a ghost in her room when she can bring herself to get out of bed?Can it. She's dead. (which would be a really tricky thing to explain when his twin brothers Becket and Myles come into play in book 6).Do you love the erudite, sharply dressed and exercise-eschewing criminal mastermind that Artemis has become as he singlehandedly carries on the family crime business and painstakingly researches fairies on his own, deciding he will catch one?Forgetaboutit. He's a surfer now, in jeans, tees and sweatshirts. He only dons a suit for the battle and they begin with him IN SCHOOL. It's a big point in the books that he's wiggled his way out of school with his genius. And Dad's in the picture from the start, force feeding him fairy lore. They crack the gnommish language completely without the fairyButler as a one-man wrecking crew (the third best martial artist in the world) who won't reveal his first name?Sooooorry. He's introduced as \"Dom or Domovoi\" by Diggums right off the bat. He's seen training martial arts only once and only kicks butt with the aid of Holly's fairy weapon.Teenaged Juliet has been inexplicably reduced to a 12-year old. I assume this is because they thought this would be a series so she could grow into the role?Diggums is now full human sized, wishing only to be a normal sized dwarf.While I loved Foaly's hair as it recalled a horse's mane, all of his snark was written out of the picture and his CGI centaur-ness didn't work visually.Opal Koboi is introduced right off the bat where she didn't appear until book 2 in the series. You never actually see anything but a cloakedHolly as a driven elf trying to prove herself capable to the demanding Commander Root as the one and only female in LEP Recon?Naw, she just wants to clear her dad's name. (Aaaand, there's no dad in any of the books for Holly - total crap) She's not at the Oak tree to perform the sacred ritual to restore her magic, but rather goes there to find her dad's badge? She has no edge.Did you find the restoring ritual interesting and cool?Hold it in your hearts, viewer because it's completely written off here.Did you like Julius Root as a curmudgeonly foil?I have no problem with casting Root as a female - but the essential anger is gone. In the books, he's called \"beetroot\" by the troops because of this epic anger. The only anger here is the audience's at having to watch this hatchet job.************The premise decimated, the 90 minutes reels out an overly expository, nonsensical flattening of the source material with zero stakes, zero chemistry, zero character development and zero heart.I so wish I could give this zero stars. Today it's at 9% on Rotten Tomatoes. I think that's a very generous mark.Pure, unadulterated junk.",

This movie while not a faithful scene by scene replay of the movie is exactly what I was looking for in an Artemis Fowl movie.

The main man himself Artemis Jr. delivers his signature cockiness and superiority in a way that doesn't make him out to be a coldhearted criminal which in today's times is definitely not a bad thing.Butler is played in spades as the best friend/surrogate father figure to young Artemis when his father is gone. I tear up every time during his \"scene\" (if you actually watch the movie you know the one)Commander root plays her part wonderfully (I will miss the noxious stogeys this character was known for, but again times we live in) as Holly's protective almost motherly figure, while also cutting her no slackCudgeon is immediately dislikable just like the books and is just as slimy as ever.Even Juliet I believe is played amazingly.All in all I cannot believe most of the reviews about this movie.

            "content": "I was extremely impressed by this movie. What impressed me was just how terribly and thoroughly they managed to botch this movie. Instead of trying to figure out what people liked about the books, it felt as though they took a bunch of random pages from the books and completely reinvented the characters to fit some random scriblings. A lot of the names are there, but the characters are off, especially Artemis. The movie version of him isn't even a pale facsimile of the book version.Now, it is entirely possible to adapt a book and completely change everything about it and still stay true to the spirit of the books or to at least make a good movie even if it's nothing like the books. However, this movie fails just as a movie. It is an absolute mess. It felt as though they took a 4 hour movie and randomly removed 2.5 hours from it. We go from Holly wanting to do terrible things to Artemis to being best buddies with him in like 5 minutes for no reason at all. Character development and motivations are just tossed. There is no coherent flow to this movie.On top of that, we get this really terrible narration by Josh Gad doing his best Batman impersonation (Judi Dench does hers as well). The problem with the narration is that it is extremely transparent that it's there to tell us what is going on and why and who these characters are because otherwise we'd have no idea that Butler is supposed to be a big badass (never shown in the movie) or that Artemis is this criminal mastermind/genius (not really shown in the movie either - Artemis is significantly more of a passive participant than he is in the books where he's a driving force of action) or any of a bunch of other things that could have been relayed to us in a more interesting way. I also can't help but think that maybe they thought the target audience was filled with morons and needed things spoon-fed to us.As a family, we listened to these books while driving to and from Glacier National Park a couple years ago. My son, who is 12, was so excited for this movie. It was a major reason why we signed up for Disney+. I knew beforehand that this movie had significant issues, so I tried to gently tamp down expectations. He said he enjoyed the movie, but I have no doubt that he was both disappointed and confused as to why this movie only superficially bears any resemblance to the books.It is stunning to me that they managed to make such an incompetent movie, especially when you had someone experienced like Kenneth Branagh at the helm. A truly missed opportunity as this could have been a great movie series. Hopefully it gets rebooted in a few years, maybe as a TV show.",

Branagh also achieved amazing connective expressiveness from all of the main actors. I loved the characters, the music, and the effects!I had not read the books. As I watched the movie Artemis Fowl, around 3/4 of the way through the movie, wonderful emotion began welling up in me. It wasn't just one scene that made me feel this deep emotion.

It wasn't the hiring of Judi Dench as the originally male-written Commander Root or the race-changing of Domovoi Butler, both cosmetic changes at best, but the adjustment of the cold, sociopathic Artemis Fowl II, around whom the series is centered, to appearing more light-hearted and heroic.

Kenneth Brannagh has crapped all over them and left us with something less appealing than the effluvia from Mulch Diggums's bum-flap.\nStoryline? Abandoned and replaced with generic mcguffin hunt. Setups for future stories are ignored making it impossible to progress as Colfer planned and doing a Rian Johnson on any future directors should this persistent floater somehow manage to garner a sequel.\nCharacters? Changed on fundamental levels, undermined and devalued in every way. Character arcs and development are abandoned. Relationships are fundamentally altered and one character, vital to later stories is dead offscreen before this even gets going. Juliet, who didn't appear in the first book, is stuck in but then used to do nothing but offer other characters food rather than being the badass she would be and is introduced as.\nWorld building? Inept and confused (Just why would the fairies have a table that's too big for them?) Fails to explain vital points for the uninitiated, wastes too much time badly explaining stuff that shouldn't even be there.\nScript? Clumsy, stumbling inanely from cliche to cliche. Underestimating the audience's intelligence at every moment and where clunky exposition wasn't forced into a character's mouth it's slapped on in an awkward, out-of character narration.\nVirtue signalling? There in spades but actually undermining the way the books challenge equality issues and the diversity it actually includes. Holly is supposed to be brown, so she's whitewashed. The Butlers -strangely no longer brother and sister - are meant to be Oriental (yes, I know Americans don't like that word but Asian means something different here and would mask the point I'm trying to make). Both of them fail dismally to do their jobs within the story or to represent the characters in the books. Holly is meant to be the first female officer in L.E.P.- Recon that's abandoned. Artemis' outsider status is given a moment's lip-service between showing him as a cool, active jock rather than relying solely on his intelligence and using assets like Butler to compensate for his shortcomings. Here, he has none.\nThere isn't one single redeeming feature in this, unless it's that Holly's uniform fits with how we always imagined it.",

Make the most obnoxious character from the book series the movie's narrator, in addition to giving him a lot of extra screen time.4. Purposely change aspects of the book's story to now make zero sense, in addition to adding in plot elements that are equally nonsensical.5. Make sure that all of the actors involved give the worst performances of their careers and/or do an atrocious Irish accent, even if they live in the center of the Earth and not anywhere near Ireland.6.

They should've started the movie out with Gaad tunnelling into the house, also (or the surfing scene) -- it would've made a nicer \"hook\" or opening scene. The interrogation scene shouldn't have been B&W, also, with all that technology, but that's probably the wannabe director/editor in me talking.I'm sure a LOT of people would love this movie, but unless you're already in a good mood or really love fantasy \"magic world\" movies, I wouldn't really recommend this.

            "content": "This movie deserves 0 stars. It's not Artemis Fowl and it can't even get by on its own merits as a movie. The story has been completely changed from the books it's supposedly based on to the point where it's completely unrecognizable as Artemis Fowl in any sense. The characters have been completely changed as well. Artemis is meant to be 12-year-old criminal mastermind with the disposition of a Vulcan that was well aware of his family's criminal enterprises for his entire life and brought up to eventually take over for his father and keep their criminal empire running. He detested athletic activity and was always extremely formal, constantly wearing suits even in his down time. His father went missing when he was very young, held by the Russian mafia, and it drove his mother insane. He was left to keep everything going and at 12 he kidnapped a fairy and ransomed her for gold. Though the protagonist, in the first book Artemis was very much the villain.In this movie Artemis is clearly just a kid that is smarter than everybody else. They kept his \"kid genius\" trait and removed everything else. His first appearance in the film is him surfing, something the true Artemis would never have done. He's constantly seen in typical clothing you would expect a kid to wear during the first portion of the film rather than his signature suits. His mother is dead and his father is kidnapped by Opal Koboi, the reoccurring villain that was introduced in the second book and had nothing to do with the Fowl family until Artemis II foiled her schemes. Movie Artemis has an emotional outburst when he learned from a news broadcast that his father is suspected of being a criminal and denies the accusations, eventually having to be dragged away by Butler, who in the movie prefers his first name despite it being a major part of his character in the books that his first name is to remain a secret unless he's dying. Butler is the one that introduces Artemis to the reality of faeries, which is what his dad was involved in, rather than Artemis discovering faeries and dragging Butler and Juliet into it with him like in the books.All of the characters have been drastically changed in similar manners, their traits and backstories completely thrown out the window and rewritten. They're mere caricatures of the characters they're supposed to be.Even forgetting that this was supposed to be a book adaptation the movie wasn't very good. The acting is bland and the actors are always either trying too hard or not trying hard enough. The manor is beautiful from the outside but there's far too big a disconnect between the style of the exterior and the style of the interior. The voice over narration by Josh is terrible, far too raspy and often difficult to understand due to that fact. The plot of the movie is very basic and recycled from nearly every hero or spy B movie ever made. The characters are watered down stereotypes with no depth to them at all. All in all, it's just terrible. Disney wasted so much money on a movie that turned out to be complete garbage.If you're thinking about watching \"Artemis Fowl\" my advice would be to just watch Spy Kids or Men in Black again instead. It's basically those two movies combined in the worst ways possible and somehow both of those movies are better films than this one.",

But it mostly focuses so much on his house, and then the rest of the movie was gotten over with towards the end. The characters are bland as well. And the visuals are although nice, felt it was taken from something like Men In Black and Harry Potter. And the \"It's feeding time\" scene was really disturbing. Being a boring fantasy movie is one thing. But it completely wasted the idea of making this a book adaptation. Honestly, I never read any of the books.

Josh Gad either tells us stuff they forgot to film (or was too expensive to film) or exposition that the movie-makers elected not to bother revealing through dialogue.Speaking dialogue, nearly every line by every character is pure exposition, like a police procedural on TV. There is no character development; hence, there are no characters arcs. Artimus Jr. is a mostly unlikable kid who is so smart has has an answer to everything. He's written so paper-thin he's almost less than one-dimensional. And it doesn't help that the actor portraying him slips in and out of his accent, and delivers his lines very flat.The only thing marginally good about the film is the music, and even that gets repetitive. This may be worse than A Wrinkle in Time, but it's close. It's hard to believe that someone didn't see this train wreck coming prior to going into production.",

There are super forced scenes.\nThere are camera movements that give circles that make you dizzy, leave the camera still for the love of God! We already know they have the software to rotate the scene!\nAnd there are parts where everything is stirred in a (literal) whirlpool, which directly understands nothing of where the characters are.Several of the adult actors are of great renown and career, but they have really been wasted, sunk into small roles and making a fool of themselves.And about the character of the boy Artemis, it is not an original concept at all,\nit's like a weird mix of Harry Potter with the guys from Narnia and spiced up with a little Robert Rodriguez's Spy Kids,\nbut Artemis is much more insolent and emboldened than all of them together, I find it hard to empathize with the child, who never doubts himself (and is 12 years old) or is afraid of anything, does not respect the elderly and mocks everyone.

            "content": "Just... Wow. This is one of those films that really gets you scratching your head. How on earth did it get made? What happened? Surely everyone behind the scenes must be cursing whomever or whatever got them involved. I've never read the books, so I have no opinion on it as an adaptation, only as a children's film in its own right, but this is a car crash of epic proportions, given its apparent budget of around $125m.There's so much talent behind this, that it leaves you utterly perplexed as to how it could turn out so badly. I can only imagine that at some point the production became such a tangled mess, that all of the talented people behind the camera threw up their arms in defeat, gave up, and decided to film just enough footage to throw together a semblance of something to please the producers.There's no point going into the story, because it's all such an incoherent mess that there's no point. It even requires a character to regularly narrate most events, simply so that there's a vague hint of why random things are happening (And the reason for that character's narration is itself flimsy).Most of the actors are perfectly serviceable, given the material, except the lead, Ferdia Shaw. I hate to say anything bad about a child actor, so perhaps this is all Kenneth Branagh's fault, giving an inexperienced actor so little direction and such a terrible script. As the title character, Ferdia unfortunately comes over as lifeless and wooden. To an extent, you can blame the story and script. The few scenes where he could have shown a hint of emotion are so badly pieced together that there was no real potential to do anything, and the story is so devoid of anything to make us like or care about his character that it would have made little difference if there was. In fact, he hasn't really _got_ a character, he just delivers lines from time-to-time.As for Dame Judy Dench... Oh my, she should have known better. She totally embarrasses herself in this mess, with a costume that makes her look foolish and a silly accent/voice that induces head-shaking despair.Moving on from the actors, the script itself is terrible at best. The child actors have to deliver lines that are not only unnatural, but are the worst forms of \"We're telling the viewer something directly! This is very important because... we say it's important!\"Visually the film has the usual pretty sheen that you would expect from a big-budget Hollywood production, which is all the more tragic given the material it's utilised for.So why two stars? Well, it's never boring. So much is thrown at the screen, along with a relatively short runtime, along with so many moments of \"What the hell is going on? Why did they do that? That line was awful! Oh, Judy, why!? \" that it's near impossible to reach true boredom.Beyond that, this is one of the worst big-budget Hollywood movies I've seen, and I've seen The Last Jedi... But at least there's some colourful visuals that young kids might enjoy for an hour and a half.",

This series could have easily rivaled the Harry Potter franchise, but with this horrendously botched effort it looks like this will run it into the ground. The removal of his mother, one of his main concerns, is disheartening and the instant retrieval of his father appallingly boring! Adding to this the introduction of many characters that are never mentioned in the first book obliterating all mystery and forging the strong, highly trained Butler to a whimpering side show.

While the visuals are good,the acting is bad.The story is fragmented,confusing and disjointed. There is no heart in this story. Yet for me the worse part about this movie is the 'hero ' himself.Artemis is an obnoxious know-it-all who lacks any humor or charm.Maybe the books paint him as an elite brat who thinks his intellect awards him the ability to be 'Fowl' to others, but it is not an admirable quality. The acting by the young Artemis is also quite bland and void of any real emotions.\nDame Judy should not be in this movie...this mess should not be on her record and Colin did well to hide himself for most of this film.\nIt was a waste of time and energy. I read the reviews and felt curious after hearing how bad they all were.The reality is true...it should be renamed to Atrocious Fowl.",

Kenneth Branagh assaults (once more) the original piece of art and makes it absolutely preposterous.\nThis movie cost 125 million for goodness sake!

I don't know what all went into play, but this one should have never been a childish movie. It could have been made in to a much pretentiously dark and goosebump ride.\nOK, lets forget the source material and talk just about the film.\nThe generic soundtrack is totally forgettable, there is no artemis fowl theme that excite us. All that we think is that at least 'A Wrinkle In Time' had a good-ish soundtrack.\nThe script is too shallow. When it's trying to surprise us, It announces \"hey we're going to surprise you\", this keeps happening again and again.\nThe fact that Artemis is a genius is not shown but spoken throughout repeatedly.\nEven the cinematography is muddled and fails to keep us in focus.\nAnd when the dust settles, our hero walk to the camera in slow motion out of nowhere to sell us that he has evolved into a genius criminal mastermind, and how do we know that, because he spells it out for us.\nBranagh uses all the slo-mos and cgi to sell us the next harry potter franchise, but with no heart, just poor lazy effort.\nBut I'm sure even Branagh let out a sigh after watching the end product because this one is dead on arrival.\nRemember how harry potter books became a staple for children after the movies, this is going to do the opposite because,\n1, This will be forgotten by next week because there are better memes than this to spent time on,\n2, I, an avid fan of the original books can't even begin to think about reading a book about this mess.\nAnd the fans who were hoping for this can just ignore this movie's presence and get on with your hopes again.

The actor who play Butler is miscast; Butler was a big man like Dwayne Johnson not bulky. They made Holly Short and Juliet around Artemis age group. In the book, Holly was an adult and Juliet was teenage and she was Butler's sister, not his niece. They made the father know about the fairies exist and kidnap by Opal, but was kidnap by Russian mafia. Sadly they wasted good talents like Colin Farrell and poor Judi Dench in this disappointing adaption, This movie joins with A Wrinkle in Time as a bad film.

But possibly aimed for the wrong age group. The dry humour seems to have gone over the heads of the american critics based on their reviews and would not be something young fans of the books would necessarily get.\nThis movie was a fun. But while I doubt current fans of the books will be satisified, the mythicly and visually interesting introduction to the world of Artemis Fowl is wonderful.

            "content": "Movies today seem to run into more trouble than I can ever remember. With politics, reshoots, budgets, fan pressure, and who knows what else, the art of making movies continues to be twisted into the former shelf of what it once was. With Covid 19 coming into the mix, the age of direct to streaming has opened up a new era of movie transformation and I shudder to think what the results will be given potential cuts to the film. Ranting aside, tonight's review is another direct to stream movie, and one with a lot of delay history on hand, as another book series is brought to life in hopes of making money. Will it work or once more are we sunk? Robbie K here ready to give you his thoughts as he reviews:Movie: Artemis Fowl (2020)Director:\nKenneth Branagh\nWriters:\nConor McPherson (screenplay by), Hamish McColl (screenplay by)\nStars:\nFerdia Shaw, Lara McDonnell, Josh GadLIKES:Judy Dench\nJosh Gad\nSome of the Comedy\nThe Cinematography\nBuild For Family\nThe Music\nThe World BuildingDISLIKES:The Pace\nThe Forced Acting At Times\nThe Special Effects\nThe Cardboard Characters\nHow Quickly Resolved Things Are\nThe Political Correctness\nToo Family Theme/Inconsistent\nA Massive Set Up Movie Instead Of Its Own film\nSUMMARY:Never having read the books, I went in pretty fresh thinking this would be Harry Potter meeting Men In Black with a bit of a family style added in. I believe on many levels my assumption was right and fortunately there were some heavy hitters leading the way. The stars for me were Dench and Gad, two actors who have their tricks for making the most of roles no matter how invested they are in the project. Dench's old school tactics and pot shots at age mix well with the \"charm\" of those she commands, a case of sensitive caring meeting dutiful officer entertaining to watch as she engaged with the new generation. Gad on the other hand continues to play his bumbling oaf of a snowman in a different form as the tricky dwarf who lives above the law in more ways than one. He seems to have fun with the role, and it's that energy that seems perfect for the character they developed for him. Gad acts as a focal point for the comedy, but Fowl's band of \"criminals\" sometimes have some tact to them that had me laughing at times, be it a well time one liner or maybe a sarcastic comment from Dench's character. It's all well themed and much like the rest of the movie has many \"family themed elements\" that I think Disney was going for in its countless troubles and directions with the film to which the target audience should love.\nHowever, the strongest elements for this reviewer are the fact the more technical elements of the film that brought the world of fiction to life. For one thing, the music is great, despite having an AC unit blaring, the cinema design for Artemis' first journey is a splendid symphony of orchestral wonder that helps add excitement to the scenes at hand. More toned-down moments are complemented by a wonderful homage to Irish tradition with pipes, flutes, and the magical moor like tones bringing that fairy tale charm associated with Irish culture. This only further gets complemented by beautiful settings to which the cinematography captures beautifully and I for one was impressed with what they displayed on screen. As for the fantasy element, Disney continues to kick butt in this department as they always do. Computer design created a very elaborate world to get lost in be it the cramped halls of the Fowl manor with its hidden secrets, or the world of the fairy that dwells below the earth where science fiction and magic turn into a hybridized world that is both mystical and new edge. Add the costumes and character design into the mix, and you get that unique flare that Disney's money can make... when used right of course. I think many of your little ones will have some new trick or treat costumes this coming fall.Yet where marketing and splendor succeed, the movie fails for me at other parts. Like much of Disney's new family themed movies, the pace seems off for a typical Disney film as Artemis' journey sort of contorts to odd angles in an attempt to put everything into a journey to inspire every person under the sun. It's too fast for yours truly, giving many of the emotional moments a blunt edge that fails to tug at the heart strings it wants to pull so badly, the way Disney movies like to do. It does not help that the characters they tried to create are poorly developed, many having any dimension effectively ripped from them to make paper thin pawns for kids to aspire to be like. There are some redeeming qualities, I won't lie about that, but in terms of characters as a whole Disney's band is set for the adolescent minds instead of all families in general. It may also suffer from the fact that the actors are also still coming into their forte on this film. The young cast sort of has one or two dimensions and have not mastered the spectrum of acting that other actors have. Throw in some of the performances feel forced or not involved enough leading to less character utilization and the selling of this movie becomes harder and harder for me to do.\nMaybe the plot and adventure aspect will be better and offset those limitations? After all Twilight has enough romance and fighting to make the film worth it right, right? No, the movie did not succeed on this aspect either for me. Artemis Fowl's limitations above carry over to this aspect of the film as well, leaving it a very skeletal framework with little sustenance for me. The adventure again is rushed, tense moments reduced to dry bouts of conversation, little build up, and action that has that modern-day family approved stamp that seems to plague so many films. Again those moments to grasp on to characters and worry about their fate become quick fix problems, where thirty seconds of an impasse show up and then resolves in some of the simplest story telling I've seen in a while. The action scenes start showing some pizazz, building up to Fowl's genius taking on this new world, only to quite in less than a minute. What happened to that magic we saw in Mulan, the lion king, Tarzan, and Toy Story, where the franchises were still to family, but were not afraid to add some darker elements to the mix. Fowl only does it with a few disturbing visuals, namely Gad dislocating his jaw, which would be more impressionable than a good action scene that actually uses its characters. An even weaker elements is how some of these fights sort have had technical jerkiness to it, like a DVD skipping, the scene would pause and then quickly speed up. While cool at some moments, it got overused and annoying for me, and felt like a distraction to the already limited scene.\nThe point this rambling makes is that the movie lacks intensity and connection to a majority of the audience, again too centered on the juvenile atmosphere that PG movies seem to have become. I also felt there was a little too much political agenda in this movie, not in the manner/degree we've seen in other films like Star Wars, Captain Marvel, and Charlie's Angels, but more like the Dream Big Princess campaign you see on Disney channel. It gets in the way of the storytelling for me and while inspirational, fans like me may lose faith in Disney putting plot development aside to stay politically relevant. Finally, this movie's inconsistencies sort of amplify that this rushed tale seems much like an intro chapter or installment to the book (which I do know enough for it to be the case), but in series like Percy Jackson and Harry Potter, those first stories also felt contained to their own tale as well. For Fowl though, the first installment focuses too much on the promise of a new series or movie coming in, perhaps another attempt to hypnotize into more toy sales. Had the other flaws not been so magnified in my eyes.The VERDICT:Artemis Fowl is cute and definitely the family friendly adventure theme that seems to be the new age of acceptable to many new parents. For this reviewer though, it gets in the way of bringing these young adult books to life, sheltering the intended audience from darker moments just to make a buck. Sure the acting will be good for the intended audience, and the music and visuals may be just the thing to hook you in to the film as you watch your children's eyes light up in delight (after all mine did for much of this film). However, the rushed plot, the forced acting, the lack of suspense, buildup, and intensity and trying to play too much in safe politics threw this film into disarray for me. While it certainly fits better on streaming rather than the theater, I can't help but wonder how much was lost to the numerous issues this film had with release. Yet, I worry even more that the studio I know can make out of this world films is losing their ability to story tell due to playing to the public interest movements. Nevertheless, I recommend this film for viewing at home of course, but take caution as some scenes may in fact be scary for those who are sensitive to the darker, more disturbing visuals.My scores overall are:Family, Fantasy, Adventure: 6.0\nMovie Overall: 4.5",

I do have to admit the trailer made it look even worse, at least the like middle 1/3 kind of sort of followed the general plot of the first book before they went on about some artifact that didn't exist in the books at all...There were several things they got fundamentally wrong, Artemis's personality was completely wrong like he went surfing? Lol. Commander Root was turned into a woman which does not work at all because Holly was supposed to be the first female LEPRecon officer... In fact there were also a bunch more female officers. The whole thing with his father was basically like wtf? That was not at all what his father was like in the books.Even assuming this was a brand new movie and not an adaptation the movie was just OK, not great or anything it would probably be a 4 or a 5 if it was not a terrible book adaptation.",

It is always hard to take Gad seriously, but this was a little extra.The biggest problem was the writing: it is clearly taken from some book that I was supposed to read, but what made Potter work was that I didn't need to read it to get the movie, but if I did I got extra.

Artemis Fowl is a Spy Kids movie that has a cast of characters wanting to have the same edginess as Batman; too bad they have no edge, or charm, here.Artemis Fowl gets 0.5/5 stars.It's a magnificently awful disaster of moviemaking.

The problem with this is they've changed so much that it's not an accurate reflection of the characters at all.\nThere's no real explanation given as to the supposed threats or danger that they're working to stop, so you don't feel overly invested in seeing them succeed.\nThe acting is quite bad in my personal opinion, I only enjoyed the performance of maybe two characters, with the rest being fairly lackluster. This includes the main character of Artemis, the actor is young so I'm sure he'll improve in the future but this performance felt like he was constantly just relaying lines he had memorised with nothing else behind it.I hope they don't go any further with this and make a sequel.

It is like a badly made replica of 2006's not-too-good Stormbreaker.The characters are not even cartoonish. The lad who plays Artemis seems to be forced onto the role. The storytelling is awful and I cannot believe Kenneth Branagh who made the first two Thor films and last year's great Murder on the Orient Express was capable of such low quality directing - maybe he is not given a choice by Disney, I don't know.This also shows that it is Disney's normal direction that is terrible. They ruined Star Wars, they ruined Artemis Fowl. Apparently, the only reason Marvel films including the masterpieces that are Tom Holland's Spider-Man films are any good is because Kevin Feige is running that ship.Also, why should every single movie including an Irishman should cast Colin Farrell and every single film should have Dame Judy Dench in every sort of role?I feel like I have wasted an important chunk of my life while watching this nonsense.",

The \"villain\" of this film, we are assured, wants to blow up the world because of some reasons, and needs our macguffin of the day to do so, deciding that it would be a fantastic idea to leave the delivery of said macguffin to the child of the supposed real hero, who has no knowledge of fairies, the underground world, or much of anything that his father gets up to at all. Also, bet it took them a whole minute to come up with the design on that dude.\nAnd that child...sweet god, I feel so bad for him. \"I'm gonna be in a Disney film, I'm gonna work with Colin Farrell and Judi Dench, this'll be a great start to my career...\"\n...yes it would be fair to say I don't think it's going to work out that way.\nI couldn't tell you whether his awful performance was even his fault or not, but I suspect he was probably the only person ever involved in this that ever cared at all. Unfortunately, that was not enough to save him from the ire of the screenwriter, who apparently decided that the best way of creating a relatable and likable protagonist was to make him Light Yagami but incomprehensibly MORE egotistical.\nNor was it enough to protect the other characters, most of whom sound like they have throat cancer for whatever reason and ALL of whom are drier than the tavern after St. Patrick's Day, or the abysmal effects, strange editing, and awful dialogue.\nThere aren't many films that I struggle to think of even one redeeming feature about, but there are even less that I cannot think of one redeeming feature about AFTER struggling to find one.\nAnd just to make it perfectly clear, this film single-handedly made me start writing reviews, because it wasn't enough to just slap a 1/10 next to it.\nTop of the morning, IMDB reviews.",

And the changes they did make don't bother me.I think the plan that the team had behind the movie was for this first film to be an origin story for Artemis becoming evil. The Ho Chi Minh scene (which is available in the extras tab) was going to be the scene that shows the audience that Artemis is willing to do whatever it takes to get to his goals. My major point was that if this was to become a franchise of movies, Artemis would be more similar to his book counterpart in future movies.IMO, you have to take the book and movie and look at it as 2 different ways to tell a similar story.Since it has had such a negative reaction, I'm disappointed that the chances of a sequel being greenlit is very low.",

I am confident that there has to be a direct-to-DVD movie that is objectively worse than \"Artemis Fowl\", but the fact that the latter is a big budget release and is comparable to the former is honestly baffling to me. \"Artemis Fowl\" is atrocious in every capacity and quite literally in every aspect; from the character's bland and uninteresting development and general lack of intrigue, to the scarcity of unique and interesting locations, to the failed captivation of the mysterious villain who, by the way, is only seen in three scenes, all of which very concise and underwhelming. What I cannot fathom as well is the story's own premise; like why does every character in this movie want the McGuffin? Unfortunately, we as audience members never quite get to find out this necessary bit of information because \"Artemis Fowl\" insists on going at break-neck pace, meaning that nothing gets sufficiently explained and nothing gets sufficiently developed, including the characters. What is even more perplexing is the fact that \"Artemis Fowl\" is so boring, despite the fact that so much happens at an incredible speed. Overall, \"Artemis Fowl\" is an F and a generous 1/10.",

Artemis Fowl was made thinking this was a good version of Spy Kids, a movie that not even children would like since it's too serious for a kid lead role.In conclusion, this is an incoherent movie that doesn't quite entertain the audience, it is not for a fan of the books or anyone that hasn't read them.

IT misses every single point of what made the books so well liked and why the figure of Artemis Fowl was such a breath of fresh air in Kids/YA literature. He's not a boy who does cool stuff, dreams of faeries and just happens to be smart. He's not a hero setting out to rescue his father, he's a cold, calculated, criminal mastermind who pulled a heist on the Faerie folk.I doubt anybody who was involved in this script has read more than the blurb on the back of the books or was interested in making this an actual series of movies as they completely ruined several important plot lines from the books within the first 20 minutes of the movie.I really don't have the energy to even go into the poor CGI, phoned in performances and middle of the road, crammed in Irish references.

            "content": "Let me start by a simple statement.This film was an absolute butchery of a wonderful piece of literature. This failure is equal if not higher than the one of Eragon(2006). At least Eragon roughly held the profiles of its characters.In this abomination, however, they, for reasons unknown, turned all characters upside down.To be perfectly clear: I am not criticising actors And their performances here. My wrath goes directly to the creative team.Also to list couple of good things about this film: the costumes and props were great. Nice attention to details, well designed etc. (not counting the cage where Holly was held). And the VFX was nice. But that's about it.Now to the scolding:Holly Short is supposed to be the first female LEP recon officer and a lot of the story actually revolves around this fact.Also she is supposed to be 80odd years old (which was actually mentioned in the film) and she was supposed to look like a young adult(which definitely wasn't).Next on the list: Why they killed Angeline Fowl???? She was a side plot of the whole first book and an important figure in most of the others.Foul sr. Should have been lost at sea, and not kidnapped by a fairy. He was supposed to be held in captivity by a russian mafia. It would be probably understandable to put in kidnapping as a dramatic enhancement, but they took a bad guy from another volume and transplanted her into this abomination of an adaptation of the first book.And now we get to the Butler. Where to start?The book clearly states that Butler is supposed to reveal his first name only if he is about to die(which he does in one of the books). The film reveals it straight away asking us to call him by his first name only.Also in the book he is described as large man of Eurasian descent which makes him inconspicuous everywhere. I wouldn't mind filmmakers casting a black man, that can be justified. But what's with that hair and eyes? Can anyone, please, explain, why they made him look like a black aryan?His sister (yes, it was supposed to be a sister, not a niece) was supposed to be a typical teenager (few years older than Artemis).And now to the main culprit of this failure. The main character himself. Artemis Foul.The casting here was actually very good. They could barely find a better suiting actor. But sadly that is the only positive thing I can say.Wearing his tailored suit from the beginning of the books, he always protested wearing casual clothing. And the film shows him in a bloody sweatshirt. And that dramatic gesture when he says I need a suit was probably the worst writing I've ever seen (and yes, I do count The Room).He is supposed to be a criminal mastermind. So why he isn't??In the film they really tuned down the genius of Artemis Foul II. He barely even thinks throughout the whole film. In the book he was a genius with published works on multiple scientific subjects (including psychology) he was always scheming and plotting and that was what made the books so good. The film portrayed him just as a clever kid. When he said I'm a criminal mastermind at the end of the film, my only reaction was: Why??? How can he say that when he never did any masterminding except saying \"I have a plan\" couple of times?He was not supposed to go to school in the first book. He did attend in the second book, but only as a direct consequence of something that happened at the end of the first book, which brings us nicely to Angeline Fowl.There are many more crimes against good judgement, storytelling, adaptation and other fields of good cinematography, but this lament is getting too long.I can't but wonder if they have any plans for the future, because the way they made this torture device they can kiss goodbye the second book (unless they want to revive dead Angeline instead of rescuing kidnapped father again).The bottom line is: technically well done movie with a terrible story and even worse adaptation value.The only truly positive thing I can say about this film is that they didn't kill the mood by shoving a nasty out-of-context song at the beginning of end credits.Mr. Colfer, Me and (I hope) most of your fans would be very much grateful, if you could wrestle the rights out of the hands of Disney and sold them (probably for much more money now ;-) ) to someone, who will be able to make a film that is worthy of your style of writing.",

Honestly, I think this would have been better as a series so that more of the story and world could be properly explored. This seemed to also be like the brutal remake of Ghostbusters in the sense that here we have characters new to the world they have discovered yet figure out how to use their weapons in seconds. Same with Ghostbusters when they came out with all those stupid unnecessary gadgets.\nThis isn't a bad film but definitely misses the mark that I'm sure Disney was hoping for.",

Why did the lead heavy not foresee the risk that the maguffin could be used against it? And so on.In its favour, the visuals were spectacular. It did not take itself too seriously. And Josh Gad provided welcome knowing comic relief. Plus, significantly for me, I stayed awake throughout; this was not boring.Maybe the story is better suited to an episodic format to better and more comprehensively do its labyrinthine plot justice. Or maybe we should treat it as an expensive trailer for the source material. Sometimes books are best left as books.",

He comes across as a bit part. Judi Dench and Lara McDonnell are the headliners with Colin Farrell bringing up the rear. Perhaps a better, more experienced child actor could have been an improvement as Artemis Foul but honestly, the writing was so bad it probably made no difference, It was cliche after cliche with some embarrassing \"cool kids\" lingo chucked in to enhance the cringe factor even more.\nMechanically operated fairies that live under the sea...was that in the book ??

The plot itself feels a bit mixed between the two books, and whilst we knew this was going to happen, it still feels weird how they mixed it in.I loved the way they introduced Mulch Diggums, and how he introduced us the story of Artemis Fowl. At first, I thought he look more \"Human\" than dwarf but by the mid way point I was somewhat content.To the directors credit, they did keep some of the events and wording from the book, and whilst they changed the plot around the books the plot was passable.The characters choices were very good. Even Commander Root being female worked really well.I absolutely LOVED Haven City! they really got that nailed. Along with the shoots, and all the creatures. Foaly was a little bit different to what I imagined however he still did the job.When I saw the troll, I was really happy with how they created the creature.To all those wanting to watch the movie that have seen the book, go in watching and expect it to be a little bit different.Thanks for reading!",

Is it just all opening numbers and profit sheets and as long as they lure enough people in initially to pay for the stupid movie, they don't care whether we like it or not?!And why change it? What metrics do they use that suggest to them that completely changing the characters and storyline is a good plan? I know not everything in a book can be adapted\nto film and things need to be shortened and changed a little to make it work, but honestly, why change the whole thing?! Do they truly think they can do it better than the source material? How often does that work?! The book is almost always better.This is not Artemis Fowl, this is 'loosely based' on Artemis Fowl, they have completely changed the character, his motivations and most of the things that make this book series so fantastic. It's boring and by the numbers. It must be so disappointing for authors like Eoin Colfer to see their books turned into these terrible films!

The visual effects are sometimes good, the soundtrack is a bit remarkable, and the camera work in some shots is pretty decent.

The acting, even from Dench and Gad, ranges from mediocre to unwatchable, which is the case of the two main kids in the story. Also, this movie clearly is not the original cut, as the scenes feel so disconnected from one another it feels that there are many scenes that did not make it into the final cult. Every element feels so disjointed and incoherent with one another that there is no clear movie here.D+",

Also, in the movie Artemis is not portrayed as a criminal, even though the books clearly describe him as \"a criminal mastermind.\"I was hoping that we would get a good adaptation for Artemis Fowl.

I just can not start describing all the flaws, and this film has many of them. Too much, actually. I rated it 5ive only because it is now a film. If I would rate generally everything in it: it would have been pure 1. I am utterly disappointed and I can not praise the film even if I would want to: there is just no valid point for me to start praising it. Some say visual effects are the only thing good in this film, but I need to disagree with it. Literally, I have seen far more action in Angelina Jolie's \"Lara Croft\". My theory is that Disney ruined \"Artemis Fowl\" only because he wanted to make it child-friendly. If so, I would be happy if he did not take it for sponsorship.

Sadly this lacks all three of those, insane cgi and special effects, then can add to it.A sad and vapid movie, done poorly.",

I watched it without reading any reviews so I went into this movie with an open mind. I honestly thought the first act, while it had a muddled pacing, was actually quite good. It did a good job introducing the world and I began to feel excited and nostalgic about delving into this world once again. Moving into the second and third act however, the plot started to lose me and I felt like any meaningful character development stopped. I did not have a problem with some of the character changes that others seemed to have (eg. Commander Root being a woman, Juliet being the niece instead of the sister) but it became clear that there was much more emphasis on the McGuffin chase and just lost my interest. I do not however agree that this is the worst adaptation ever made that others seem to think. The books were targeting an age group of preteen children and that seemed to be the same demographic that Disney was targeting with this movie. Perhaps it's because all of the fans of this book series are probably adults like myself that I'm seeing so much disappointment with this movie, because it clearly wasn't made for us. I think Disney needs to figure out who will be wanting to watch this franchise if they are going to move on with sequels but personally, I would very much love to see The Arctic Incident with some improvements that Disney will hopefully learn from the reception of this film.",

I can see where they tried, but you will be disappointed if you are a fan of the original book series.\nIt's just Disney. I'm not surprised. Disney is now a very large company known worldwide. They don't even have to try anymore. This is an example of Disney being lazy and uninspired.\nTake a look at the How To Train Your Dragon series from Dreamworks. They steered almost completely clear of the original plot and still managed to deliver. How? Because Dreamworks knows how. The plot is it's own while still being respectful to the original piece.\nDisney on the other hand is almost always there for the money. The plot is lazy and is full of cliches. Don't watch if you are a fan of the original book. If you have no idea what Artemis Fowl is, give this movie a try.

Dench and Farrell gave good performances as the fairy military commander and Artemis Sr. respectively, but Josh Gad was incredibly annoying throughout the movie. He tried to do his best William Shatner impression but failed. His overacted, pretentious reading as the dwarf narrator was one of the many faults in this movie. Josh Gad was also miscast as a dwarf, mainly because of his height. The movie tried to cover it up with a series of tall dwarf jokes that consistently fail to land, like the majority of the so-called jokes. The character development was also lacking. We don't learn until the tail end of the movie that Artemis is a criminal mastermind. And, finally, the script has way too many holes. First, it never bothers to tell the audience what organization interviewed Josh Gad. How will the Fowls overcome its new media image? And, how can an effective army, which should rely on a clear and unbreakable command structure, have a captain overrule a decision of a commanding officer? Overall, 4/10 stars. Its unbearable for viewers who have not read the books and I'm sure it is even more so for dedicated fans of the series.",

Why? Did the director feel they didn't have enough strong female characters? What about Holly, second in importance only to Artemis himself in the first book. And Juliet Butler, she develops into a very strong character. As good as Judi Dench is, she did not need to be in this film, certainly not as Julius Root.Butler. \"Whatever you do, dont call him the Butler\". When I saw that Nonso Anozie was cast, I was excited to see a good representation for the complex character, bit this was not the case at all. The film has you believe that the bodyguard to Artemis Fowl jr, who is barely seen considering he is essentially attached to Artemis in the books, does not get called Butler, bit instead by his first name. The literal opposite of how it actually was in the books. There was no need at all to change this in the film, it served no importance to the plot.The Aculos. Another item not needed. Why it couldn't follow the plot of the book is beyond me, it was exciting enough that it generated an entire series of books after it.All in all, if it wasnt for a few sections of the film that made me laugh in a good way, I would have given this one star, but the filmmakers should thank Josh Gad as Mulch Diggums for the second.I would not recommend watching this film.

Yes it's a bad movie but almost everything about it was strange.Let's start of with the good. Well Lara McDonnell gave a decent performance as Holly Short, her character had an underdeveloped plot but i liked her performance in the movie. I know i'm in the minority in this but i mostly liked Josh Gad in this movie, yes the narration was unneeded, the grouchy voice was annoying (it's even addressed in the movie) and some of the scenes involving his CGI use was horrible but i enjoyed the charisma and witt he brought in the movie. He played as a tall dwarf and he looked like the only one having fun in that movie so yeah Josh Gad was a silver lining.The concept and potential was there and interesting as well, the first act was not that bad as you are introduced to the other worlds of Artemis Fowl like the fairy kingdom was an interesting concept and the CGI was decent early in the movie too but that potential was never realized. Being a Kenneth Branagh movie some shots looked nice and well directed AT TIMES with some decent set pieces here and there.Now the Bad. Ferdia Shaw who played Artemis Fowl had a hammy performance throughout the movie, at times he seemed too monotone and stoic and the other he seemed to be over-acting, it wasn't a terrible performance as he got a lot better during the third act but that was one of the many problems of the movie. Another problem was how scenes seemed to be stitched together and all over the place. Not to give anything away but the majority of the movie takes place in a House.The runtime is 1hr 30 minutes and it seems some scenes were removed and the pacing was too fast and dodgy as you're not given time to fully flesh out characters and the runtime is just filled with exposition and world building but you're never given time to care about the characters or the plot. Judy Dench also gave a weird performance with a grouchy voice, The CGI got bad real fast and this is a big budget movie mind you especially with some bad action sequences.The heist aspect of the movie took a backseat as most of it was explained through narration which took away any thrill or suspense. The villain was awful as he/she has a generic motivation to take over the world and i don't mind that but there is no backstory or any reason to be invested in the villain so it just ends up being generic movie bad guy 101 oh and he/she has a grouchy voice, i have no idea why this movie had an obsession with grouchy voices.Colin Farrell as Artemis' father had the potential to be an interesting character but as soon as you're introduced to him, he is immediately gone. The adventure aspect is also poorly executed and the way how the main conflict is resolved is just baffling.Like i said the whole movie was strange, Also some scenes drag on and we are talking about a 1hr 30 minute movie here and the story never goes to interesting places and again you never care for the characters. So overall, didn't hate his movie, but it's not a good movie by any means.",

From the beginning to end, the movie goes smooth and it kind of managed to end the story.\nHowever, not sure whatever the reason, the story really sucked. After watching for more than an hour or so, I kind of felt that the whole movie didn't have any good story. The whole story could be told in two to three lines. Also, the movie had lots of 'filler' actions, actions were added to make the movie longer, instead of contributing to the story. There were many unanswered questions, many contradictory statements.\nNow, the main actor, he was a young boy, he tried his best. But, he was overdramatic, it was clear that sometimes he was walking or behaving too dramatic for the sake of the camera. At the end, even if he was a genius, he made a rookie mistake! Of course, you need to watch the movie, regardless how bad it is, to find that mistake!\nAt the end, while Black Lives Matter and the protest against anti-Black racism and stereotype are going on, this movie made it clear that Disney actually supported slavery and black stereotype (in England, in modern days, only Servant in the movie was Black). Except giving the guy blue eyes, also another tone-deaf approach to show that blue eyes are better than original black eyes of the Black folks, his only role in the movie was to serve, and listen to a white kid with questionable judgement. The master of the house was multi-generational rich and white person, and most probably a big supporter of slavery. Just like Mulan, a movie to please the Commies, Disney released another tone-deaf movie exactly proving the point that systematic racism exists in mainstream media.",

The young actor that played Artemis Fowl II (Ferdia Shaw), this is his first ever credit on IMDb. I feel so bad for this kid. This is a terrible performance. It feels amateur in every way. It feels like whenever he gets one of his lines out his face locks up. It's downright cringey and embarrassing. The worst part of this movie is that it feels like it has no story. The core story of this movie is that Artemis Fowl sr. (Colin Farrel) is kidnapped. Whoever kidnapped him wants this thing that would give him infinite story. It's a giant MacGuffin that everyone wants. So Artemis Fowl II has to find this thing so he can get his dad back. That's what the film is about summarized on paper, but that's not what the movie's about. The movie has no idea what it is about. Josh Gad narrates almost the entire movie. The first six minutes is nothing but exposition and it continues so heavy-handed throughout the entire film because they don't know how to condense this story into 94 minutes (super short). Our main character is supposed to be liked by everyone, but he is super annoying and not interesting. Because of that you don't really care about what he's doing. This is easily in the top 10 worst live action Disney movies ever made. This is barely a movie. It's barely a story. If you're a fan of these novels, you're probably going to hate this. This is more of a spy kids movie than an Artemis Fowl movie. Keep in mind that this movie cost $125 million, directed by someone who has directed good films in the past and has talented people in it. For some reason it feels like a stack of scenes strung together to last 94 minutes. It doesn't feel like it has story, charcters, or any compelling elements. It just feels like a property that has been given a feature film treatment. It's so bad and very dissapointing.",

            "content": "This movie really wasn't the best and felt quite rushed and had so much more potential so I'm going to try and keep this as short as possible but I do have to go over so many things so I will therefore bullet point these things with an explanation to why I have listed them.Acting:Artemis Foul/ The main character:\nThe acting in this film was just plain awful in my opinion. It all just felt too forced from more or less, every character. The main boy just showed no emotion and just sounded monotone throughout the entire film. Now I understand that the child is young and acting is extremely hard especially playing this type of role and I do not want to seem like I'm blasting a child's performance but there are younger actors who can preform well beyond this such as the entire cast of the comedy Good Boys or even one of the main boys from that film, Jacob Tremblay and his performance in films such as Wonder or Room. Now the film Stormbreaker didn't really smash the box office but Alex Pettyfers acting in the film is how this kid should have acted in Atermis Foul. Alex actually showed emotion and facial expressions which made you connect more with the character and felt like you was watching a film rather than what seemed like a fan made film or trailer.Domovoi/Butler:\nThis character was just naff, he tried so hard to be the big tough bad ass but it just failed especially during scenes that was meant to be funny or heartfelt. I seemed like he was trying to hard to be the type of character that Dave Bautista played in GotG or the secret agent from Lilo and Stitch. You know, the character that is just completely bad ass and seems like the rough and tough character but when they do something that doesn't fit that role it's either really funny or actually quite sweet but this is because the characters don't force either or these things on you and it's all natural where as this actor and the character just tried to hard to make you think he was the guy made of steel with no emotions then tried to force these comedic or emotional scenes onto you.Now the only 2 characters that were any sort of decent were the higher up celebrities such as Josh Gad or Colin Farrell but even these were mediocre at best. I think I chuckled twice at Gad's character but other than that it was poor. The constant narrating by Gad was just annoying, distracting and got a bit repetitive with the constant play on how \"cool\" Artemis was and how he was the best, to be honest this all felt like the little movies you get playing on the small TV's while waiting in a line for a horror/scary rollercoaster or those interactive horror mazes. Every time one of these scenes ended and Gad finished narrating I felt like it was time to go into the next room. Also must point out that Dame Judi Dench must be at the lowest of the low after Cats and now this, to put it blunt, she was awful and honestly just seemed like she did not want to be there or in the movie at all.The plot: (potential spoilers)\nNow this is based only on the film and nothing to do with the book.\nThe plot was...meh...it felt a tad rushed and got boring throughout the majority of the film if I'm honest and my partner felt the same. Now the effects in the film weren't too bad at all and was probably the main reason I continued to watch as they were impressive it was just a shame the story was a bit...slow? I think that's probably the best way to describe it. There was quite some action but it felt like instead of this Artemis character actually doing anything that would deem him a cool action hero, they just forced that he was this kind of character by telling you he was. It seemed every time he done something, they had to focus on this and add some slow motion like when he drops a glass of milk for instance. But he falls short of the hero by getting his butler killed (more or less), taking his sweet time killing that massive troll and nearly failing to rescue his father on time. All in all, I did not enjoy the film and I felt like it was just slow, quite boring and the acting was terrible. Could see this becoming a more serious, mature Netflix series over time which would put this to complete shame. Ah well each to their own.",

I heartily recommend you purchase the books instead, read them, and never watch this rubbish. Even if you get it free, you're still wasting your time and ruining a good read. I always thought the series was so visually descriptive and imaginative that it was just crying out for a film franchise. But somehow Disney took a gift brief and utterly stuffed it. Mulch Diggums should've been great but they made him a Hagrid clone who ends up clumsily narrating the whole story because the film-makers were too lazy or stupid to write a decent script. Dame Judy Dench is utterly wasted. Colin Farrell likewise. Neither have much to do but plod through heavy handed exposition. The titular Artemis Fowl is poorly acted and somehow they wrote out a lot of the reasons the character was so well loved. Throughout the books he's a bit of a nerd - and proud of it. He's the brains not the brawn - a positive role model to young kids who are more academic than sporting. But no. The opening scene has Artemis surfing like a pro and jumping a hoverboard. Later he fires a laser gun like he's been doing it all his life. Very disappointing. And so much for the 'little people'. Obviously budget didn't stretch to scaling pixies and leprechauns down because they were all adult size - just a set of pointy ears and done. Imagine if the Hobbits in Lord of the Rings were just people size. Half the charm is that they're little yet make a big difference. It's just lazy. Only a smattering of terrible CGI... I don't even know what they were - gnomes?? reminded us of the rich vein of legends and stories this movie steadfastly refuses to acknowledge. This was most evident in Holly who looked like a child, not a small adult. And Judy who was large and in charge as Commander Root - a curmudgeonly male in the book. Folley is horribly over-acted. Butler and his daughter are an awful token effort to inject some coloured actors. It feels forced and yeah, nice work Disney, you made him the butler. The ubiquitous CG effects give the whole thing a synthetic look. It felt like a horrible mishmash of early 90's Marvel movies and the worst bits of Harry Potter - filmed entirely on blue screen sets with stagey lighting. Aaarrg. I could go for hours. Just take my word for it and go read the books. Like the prequel Star Wars movies - forget this film exists or it'll ruin the previous material for you.",

Oireland\" I knew there was no redemption. It's hard to fathom that garbage like this can still get so far in production before being redirected to the nearest recycle centre. It comes as no surprise that Kenneth (wooden)Branagh was attached to this given the hatched job he did on the Shackleton Biopic but this, this film should be a criminal offence.From about ten minutes in I wanted to scoop out both eyes with a melon baller and swirl it about in the sockets. I actually felt nauseated after that but persisted in the vain hope that either the film would magically turn about or an asteroid would hit. I often heard that a story has plot holes but this plot hole had no story, at all. With any other title one would be wary of spoilers in reviews but here to say there was anything to spoil would be a monstrous lie.In short (and not that dreadfully aggravating fairy of the same name) anyone who can read and loved those books, please avoid this at all cost, what with Covid19 and recession, this will send you right over the edge.

The film sees Artemis Fowl (Ferdia Shaw), a young criminal prodigy, hunts down a secret society of fairies to find his missing father (Colin Farrell).Having never read any of the novels or knowing the source material aside from the name, I didn't have an emotional or already existing investment in the source material, so this film didn't irritate from that perspective like it has done to the fans (due to the negative reactions to the trailers and the reviews of this film). No, Artemis Fowl irritates me purely from a filmmaking and narrative perspective and for wasting 96 minutes of my life on its boring, convoluted, poorly written, blatant sequel/universe set up story, poor performances of uninteresting and irritating characters and a laughable production value at times.The story is a choppy mess, in which the writers clearly didn't know whether they wanted to make a straight up origin story or an original tale in which the characters are established. Instead the film attempts to do both, as well as craft a launching platform for a sequel (which I guarantee won't happen). There is so much lore, terminology, locations and name drops thrown at the screen with 90% of the dialogue being expository, of which is delivered insufferably by Josh Gad's character in a ridiculous and grating gravelly voice. The villain (I honestly don't think they even name them and they never even interact with Artemis) motivation is utterly boring and lacks any depth. The pacing is terrible, due to the lack of plot focus the film feels far longer than its 96 minute runtime.Visually the film varies wildly from at times decent CGI and a bold colour palette to a low budget TV show set design and awful special effects. This is the same with costume and prosthetic designs that vary from fairly impressive to tacky and garish. The purely CGI characters have a bizarre frame rate and almost blur around them which is especially prevalent in the Troll battle sections in which the choreography is a complete mess, with poor editing and lacks thrills. The last battle you will have seen so many times before and done better in other similar genre films.The performances are basically all bad. I don't want to be too harsh on the child actors but they are awful here, Artemis lacks any personality or presence, and whenever he and the other kids have dialogue it normally descend into shrieking annoyance. Josh Gad is the 'comic relief' and exposition machine. He gives an unfunny and cringe inducing performance with his voice at times switching tone from line to line. Colin Farrell completely phones in the 3 or 4 scenes he is in and Judi Dench is laughable as the deep voiced (it rivals Gad's) leader of the fairies.Artemis Fowl is an utter waste of time, a boring, convoluted, uninspired, annoying chore that Disney have thrown onto their streaming service because it would have completely bombed in cinemas. More like 'Artemis Fail'.",

            "content": "Artemis Fowl\nReleased June 12th, 2020\nDisney+Starring: Ferdia Shaw, Josh Gad, Colin Farrell, Judi Dench, Nonso Anozio\nDirected: Kenneth BranaghWell...sigh...huh??? I suppose when you look at all the finer details of this production from Walt Disney Studios, I have no idea why I was so surprised of the final cut that was essentially dumped (over three...THREE years after principal photography) on their streaming service over a year after their initial theatrical release date. The first teaser trailer for Artemis Fowl dropped on March 2nd, 2019. Talk about the anticipation! If I'm not mistaken, allot of the footage we saw in this teaser trailer did not even make it into the final cut of the finished product. Not really a shocker considering it was only announced that Colin Farrell was going play the role of Artemis Fowl Sr. in March of this year! After the rumours of numerous reshoots and the runtime of the final product that we had the (dis)pleasure of watching, I still didn't think that this was actually the film that we were going to get post production. I can only imagine how long the first edited version of this film would have been - compared to the final 90 minute epic failure this was! And...I didn't even read the literature for this film that I know is beloved by many fans. I feel especially sorry for everyone who actually read the source material and waited so long with such high anticipation and this was what they got.This film is an absolute mess. I am not going to get into specific details but you can tell they completely destroyed the continuity of the story during the editing process. There are soooo many gaps and plot holes in this film. I found myself rewinding sequences several times to make sure I in fact didn't miss a scene or some imortant piece of dialogue. And I am sure this goes without saying, but what the hell was Josh Gad and Dame Judi Dench thinking (or even more disturbing director Kenneth Branagh thinking with this idea of having these two talented actors portraying their versions of Christian Bale's Dark Knight - their voices were insufferable!) when rolling through each scene??? Kenneth Branagh is a fairly talented director and actor (IMDb credits include 2017's Murder on the Orient Express, 2015's live action remake of Cinderella, & Thor) and so I really expected a little more from the direction and efforts from the cast. And as badly as I feel for Ferdia Shaw and his efforts to bring beloved 12-year old diabolical genius and mastermind Artemis Fowl to the big screen, it really wasn't his fault for the failure of this movie. I truly feel sorry for him as this was literally his first acting role EVER; and it is very apparent throughout the film. I just think that with all the time this production wasted and all the choppy editing and reshoots, they would have figured out that they may have cast the wrong actor for this role. And finally, if you were to overlook the choppy editing and screenplay, poor dialogue, poor casting choices and character depictions, and massively apparent plot holes, I was at the very least hoping for a visually stunning film...let's just say some of the CGI is...to not put too fine a point on it, was distracting.Whoa...this is exactly why I didn't really want to do a review of this film. I know how much work and time and blood, sweat, and tears goes into making a film, especially with the massively high expectations of adapting a beloved novel series, and so I feel truly bad for this final product. There will be younger audience out there that can easily overlook all of the things I've mentioned and thoroughly enjoy this film, but honestly, this was a catastrophic misfire by Walt Disney Studios. They squandered a massive opportunity to create a franchise. But now, forced to dump this film on their streaming service and with such overall poor reception by practically everyone, I doubt we ever see another Artemis Fowl film.Despite how many things went wrong with this film, and I may actually never give it a second viewing, it was still nowhere close to the worst film I've seen in 2020.

Other reviews are searching for artistic merit and depth somewhere it's not supposed to be. I have seen films rated 1 or 2 ( or the first few minutes) and this does not deserve ratings like that. Honestly,, probably a 6-7. Story is good, visually, you believe the trolls n fairies are real and it keeps moving along at a reasonable pace. I think the lockdown must have made the crazies crazier.

This is a movie aimed directly at the young teen market so you can't expect it to please all the adults. As for the people who always insist on comparing movies to the books, you can't always get all the details from a book into a movie as books allow the reader to use their imagination and picture things differently than what the writer had envisaged.\nThen there are the critics who say things like \"it's a confusing story line\" and \"I couldn't follow the story\", where we watching the same movie ?? I had no trouble following the story. Yes a lot of it was predictable and some of it was a bit corny, but that how these movies usually are, they are supposed to be a bit of light relief and fun.

All that remains are the character's names. I was baffled at some of the choices the movie makers made here. Why give Holly some bogus reason of looking for her father or whatever when it would make more sense to use the original reason for why she came to the tree: to perform the ritual that restores her magic. This is what Artemis in the books knew and used to his advantage when capturing Holly. Instead he's just sitting there waiting because someone saw a fairy there once upon a time??Also, even if they chose not to make him a criminal (which defies the whole point of his story, but oh well...) they could at least have given him some brainpower. They could have showed his intelligence by having him decipher the book with the secrets of the fairies, as he did in the books. He managed to decode their language, which is why he knew all their secrets.It would have made sense to keep this sort of things in the movie when they were sticking to the overall plot anyway (like keeping most of the plot confined to the manor, the time freeze, the troll, Diggums; it's all there, just muddled beyond recognition and sense.)In the end, I think what I missed the most was the banter between the main characters, especially Mulch, Foaly and Holly. There were so many opportunities to use dialogue from the books, but instead the script writers decided to make their own, half-assed dialogue for no apparent reason.And lastly, don't get me started on how they butchered the two main characters, Artemis and Holly. They took away any personality that these two characters possessed, and left only empty husks in their place. Holly seems like a misplaced little girl while in the books she was always quick thinking and fearless, and Artemis is no mastermind and definitely not a criminal one. That sentence at the end of the movie just seems absurdly misplaced after the whole movie was spent trying to make Artemis into a good guy. Just some ordinary teenager who likes sports (wtf) and who only wants to save his father (in the books, his father is gone and his mother is sick with grief... here she's dead for no apparent reason). What made Artemis in the books a bit more relatable despite being a cynical child genius, was that he was completely hopeless when it came to physical endurance. He could barely bounce a ball. He was the brains while Holly and Butler was the muscle. So when the movie creators give him both brains and makes him an extremely skilled surfer, he becomes even farther removed from someone that a kid can relate to. He's seemingly perfect. Or at least, that's what the movie is trying to tell us.It has yet to show us any of that geniusness because seemingly, all the problems just solved themselves.",

Ferdia Shaw and Lara McDonnell gave creditable performances in the two lead roles of Artemis Jnr and Holly, the latter in particular and the former only when not wearing shades which took away too much expression.

Not much is done right I'm afraid! I'm not going to list everything wrong. Just be warned if you are a fan of the books, you will not like what they have done here!This should never had been made as movie, unless they really did a movie chronologically (which they definitely did not!) of book one and the move forward with a new movie for book two and so on.\nOr, and I really wish they had gone this way, they should have made this a series on either of the streaming platforms.\nWith a decent budget this could have been a fantastic show I believe!The best char in the movie is by far Lara McDonnell as Holly Short. In fact she is the only one that feels right for the role, and her performance is on point. So hats of to her.",

It's just a bad movie that barely acknowledges the source material.For those in Ireland, the opening is even borderline insulting. Mulch is apprehended by the Irish Police (the Gardai) and is interrogated by...wait for it...British Intelligence? This would never happen in real life since Ireland won its independence from Britain quite a long time ago. This goes beyond mere stupidity to the sort of uncaring plot hole that betrays the level of care that goes into this movie. The Hill of Tara, an actual real physical place in Ireland, does not have a mysterious tree either. Sorry. As for surfing...well, let's all just agree that Disney and Geography separated during the production of Artemis Fowl :). They also separated themselves from the books.If you can ignore the plot holes, lack of consistency to the books, the coincidences, the thoroughly unconvincing presentation of Artemis' intelligence, and a few poorly executed set pieces, it's still not a complete disaster.

What a shame. I really liked the design (although why the fairy troops were wearing Adidas cricket helmets back to front was a mystery) and some of the sequences were directed with flair. The performances were universally OK; young Ferdia Shaw was no worse than anyone else, but with no plot or character development nobody stood much of a chance. It was all too frenetic.

Not because this is a complicated film but because the story this is basically just a 90-minute collection of scenes that have been randomly thrown together, often with poor quality CGI thrown over the top of it.This isn't helped by the wooden and poorly developed characters. Josh Gad is unbearable as the films narrator, grating through numerous already tedious scenes with a frankly dreadful put on accent. You can tell Lara McDonnell is trying her best in the role of Holly Short but she's given nothing to work with here and it shows. The script is just awful. Quiet why Judy Dench and Colin Farrell felt compelled to star in this I really don't know.And I don't like ripping on a kid just starting out in their career but the performance of Ferdia Shaw is dreadful and up there with one of the worst I've ever seen. He has no charisma or personality as Artemis and gives one of the most unlikeable performances I've seen in a lead role of a film, and I include films in that where you are supposed to dislike the lead character. Was this really the best actor Disney could find for the role?If you've got 90 minutes to spare and don't know what to do with it, staring at the wall would be a better use of your time then watching this would be.",

Stuff from the books happens, but it's buried under a bunch of unnecessary and bad changes and twisted around to the point that it's close to nonsensical. This was a great book series and there was a point when I was younger that I even considered it my favorite book series ever; but it's so altered and watered down here that it loses everything that made the series good. Artemis Fowl's character arc from villain to hero was great and probably the first arc like it that I saw in a series as a kid; but here he comes across like a ripoff Harry Potter with all character development and nuance cast aside in favour of a blatantly heroic protagonist. Kenneth Branagh is great at acting and he can do faithful adaptations (such as his awesome and incredibly faithful version of Hamlet), but it seems like he either didn't put any effort into this movie, or he just thought that having the title character start off as a villain would be too hard for kids to understand, so he made a watered down version of what was a reasonably complex story (at least in terms of childrens and young adults literature). Or maybe it's all Disney's fault and not his, I don't know. Regardless, this is garbage and I feel bad for Eoin Colfer. I know some people were able to enjoy it and so I guess good for them, but I doubt many of those people would still enjoy it if they read the book version.\nThe Percy Jackson movies were more faithful adaptations than this, honestly.",

It's like Disney didn't want him to have a regular voice so kids are not like why is Olaf in this.If you are looking to put this on for your kids to keep them entertained it will do the job. It does have a lot of action scenes, but if you want to watch it as well, I'd suggest picking another film.",

He is also able to surf, but in the books known to be not a physically able person.\nButler is emotional and not at all the deadly guardian.Story:\nThey tried to mix all the books into one and made it a difficult to comprehend racing array of pictures.The whole movie is cringe-worthy, poorly executed and without any love. It is a clear licence to make money and I hope it tanks so hard that they stop following up.\nThey should have just called it something else, change the names and pay Eon Culfer a bit because they stole some ideas.What was Eon Culfer, the author of the books, thinking giving this to Disney?Yes, I am angry, because this, while never the potential to become a second Harry Potter, has been an amazing book series with so much detail and love towards the characters, but they did not even care to stay true to the book a tiny bit. Some screenplay hack tried to be creative and let his ego take control and seemed to change things for the sake of making it his or her own.Awuful waste of time. Very sad.",

Recon's first female officer in the book series.Seems like second part is coming.... Or is it? Fowl family goes hunt the Opal Koboi at end with Holly Short and Mulch Diggums, what \"happy ending\".So the movie takes some from the book, mixing even first and second and all the books together, taking some parts away and adding some weird stuff to plot. Like what is Aculos, there was no such thing in books...I think I need see eye doctor after forcing myself to watch one hour and 28 minutes of this mess.",

            "content": "So, let me start this by saying that I am a huge fan of the series. It was the first series I ever read, so it holds a very special place in my heart. I had huge expectations for this film going into it.The changes of Root and Trouble's characters to females I wasn't a huge part of, but ultimately didn't negatively impact the story or Holly's character arc. Juliet is now Butler's niece instead of his sister, but again, their close relationship is still there. So while I wasn't a fan of the changes, they are what they are and suit the movie. I didn't like the removal of Avangeline Fowl (in the books she is alive, in the movie she has passed away) but it is what it is.The trailers don't do the movie justice, and makes the film look subpar- however the movie was absolutely brilliant.I'll get the things I like out of the way first before I move on to things I didn't like.I really liked the combined storyline of the first and second books, it worked really well.The inclusion of Opal as the antagonist of the first movie was interesting, but really paid off. It worked and introduced her character well.Kenneth's direction was awesome, there was an element of homely movie with the perfect sprinkle of magic. It was quite captivating.Josh Gad enthralled me as Mulch, absolute perfect casting. His comedic timing and the bickering was on point!Ferdia Shaw was excellent as Artemis, he really captured the character. Although I don't know why they made him athletically active, from what I remember in the books he wasn't that gifted when it came to running/fighting. But it works with the movie. I just wish they made him more.... evil, like the books. Book Artemis is quite devious and the movie was missing the devious spark that he had.Lara McDonnell was gorgeous as Holly Short, perfect choice!Nikesh Patel was awesome as Foaly, funny as well as intellectual- the perfect Foaly!\nNonso Anozie was sensational as the Butler we all know and love, really bringing the character to life.The inclusion of Colin Farrell as Artemis Fowl Senior was actually really heartwarming. Their relationship made Artemis somewhat more relatable.Judi Dench as Commander Root just felt....off. Not because of her, she was brilliant, but because Commander Root is a male, and has a lot of quirks that were missing from the film. Dench brought her own flare, however, I just wished she hadn't have gone with the growl-like voice that she had. Maybe it was an attempt to make her seem tough, to make fans more accepting of the change of Root from male to female, but it just didn't work. But, if they were going to cast any actress and a gender-bent Root, Dench was a great choice.Now, the things I didn't like.I really don't like that Artemis and Holly bonded over their fathers. It felt like the Superman/Batman/Martha trope, if you know what I'm talking about).It really would have been nice for the movie to be longer, so they could include more of the story from each of the books. The character development felt very, very fast- as did the friendship development between Holly and Artemis. It felt very forced.All in all, I really enjoyed this film. Fans of the books will enjoy it, I think. It holds it's own without ruining the magic and integrity of the source material (looking at you, The Last Airbender). Give it a try!",

            "content": "In the first Artemis Fowl book, even I'll admit, not very much happens. It all amounts to a novel length, day-long sting operation.What ultimately makes it work, however, is merely the complexity in simple plumbing. What makes it work is being able to see the development and thought processes of this child prodigy, and seeing how we get from his introduction to a life or death standoff between him and a magical militia (and furthermore how he succeeds in his own devious ways).In regards to the Artemis Fowl movie, I get the impression that there was someone probably higher up the creative wrung than director Kenneth Branagh (who happens to be a very competent director) who didn't trust that this franchise was strong enough to get by on merely that. It shows with how unnecessarily dense the movie was.From beginning to end, the titular Artemis Fowl is touted to be this super genius, but from memory I can only really remember him doing two or three things that displayed who he really was (if even that). The rest of the movie flew by with about an hour and twenty minutes of force fed narration (side-bar: is it just me or does Josh Gad try to upstage every movie that he is in?), elements from the sequels jammed into the plot, quite a few important plot devices thrown out the window, and ten times more than your daily dose of action that would make Michael Bay's 'Transformers' movies look bland by comparison. By all accounts, it is the cinematic equivalent of dangling keys over your baby for an hour and a half. If the movie was half an hour longer and took time to BREATHE AND REFLECT then maybe it could have worked (and also by omitting half of the inclusions).For what it's worth, I felt like the acting and overall design of the movie were really good. I didn't even mind some character changes (like Artemis being more athletic and emotional). It's only unfortunate that these details were colossally overshadowed by everything else.I'm generally very forgiving when it comes to adaptations of books because it's nearly impossible to please everybody on a good day. But it's sad when you take a step back and realize that the minutes long trailer was better than the movie it was advertising.",

Now before going into the review, let's point out that Disney managed to bring the film out of development hell, so you should at least give them some credit for trying.Pros: The Visuals were stunning, it had excellent acting from supporting actors, it also had an understanding relationship between humanity and the mystical beings that are in hiding (Even though it was horribly explained).Cons: The over reliance on visuals made the film seem fake at some parts. I understand that the studio did everything they could to make a fantastic film, but they spent too much money on visuals, too little on a compelling plot. Just because a film is filled with state of the art visuals doesn't mean it will garantee a financial and critical success. Ahem, Transformers and its sequels. The main protagonist was just annoying, and I mean he cannot act annoying. When I rewatched the film, I skipped every scene that heavily focused on the main character. Keep in mind, it's a 1.5 hour film, and that didn't even help it. The other actors did a great job. Bravo! They were great in the film. The plot is also spliced from two books in the series, making the film into a convoluted mess. I can tell a lot was cut on the editing floor, and while editing a really long film can help make it a critical darling, depending on what gets cut out, whoever edited this film did terrible. The editors did worse than those on Transformers: The Last Knight. And that is not a good sign. The series is also gritty and dark, not exactly the Disney route. They shouldn't have made the film to begin with. Hopefully this taught Disney a lesson, if they want to make a dark and gritty book series into a franchise in the foreseeable future.I really wanted to like the film, but it was so bad.Also, the Pandemic didn't really help the film as well, which would not have really done any damage to the film because of how bad it is, but it did help Disney financially by having it on Disney+. Good Job on them for that.",

It felt very rushed and not enough time were spent to explain things.The effects were nice, as modern movies cand make. Its Disney after all.Personalitywise, Artemis Fowl felt nothing like the books, too geeky somehow. Don\u00b4t know if its because of the actor or the script, but he has to have a more arrogant personality.

Look at the real successes like Harry potter, Lord of the rings etc. What do they have in common? they stick to the story that the extremely gifted authors wrote. That is what captured peoples imagination. they stuck to the original and added great artistic special effects, inspired Direction and the right talents doing the acting. This movie tried to get by on its name, one great actress, and special effects. They sacrificed the magical element that the author had inspired and produced a predictable piece of high calorie, sugary rubbish that's been shoved out so many times before. We, the thinking public look for the translation of our beloved classics to be as true to the story as is possible and enhanced by the producers not just an expensive light show.",

Mulch Diggums actor was horrible narrating and was poorly cast. Plus Diggums is a dwarf and should be smaller than Artemis.The worst casting is Butlerwho is large in stature and for and most important EURASIAN. Russian-Japanese to be specific. If they couldn't find someone to fit the exact bill then cast a large Russian or a Japanese actor.There's so much more wrong with it.I recommend listen to the audiobooks narrated by Nathaniel Parker who is brilliant at bringing all these characters to life. And is completely entertaining. And exceedingly better than this mess of a movie.",

What a bad movie with a lot of potential! The graphics were good. But the story, lines, music... just terrible!!! No suspense, no character building, illogical moments... It could have been an Harry Potter franchise if I read all the positive reviews about the books. But the movie sucks big time. This is what I made up from the movie after watching it forcefully spread over three nights (spoilers alert!):Super smart rich arrogant surfdude kid Artemis, with no mother, learns that the stories from his father about a secret fantasy world of elves, trolls, kobolts, etc are not just stories. His father is kidnapped by some bad guy in a cave, whom wants some magic weapon thing, that is important as the sun, as ransom within 24 hours from Artemis. Artemis has a mastermind briljant plan: he kidnapps an Elf that by coincidence is on the right time on the right place and is also the daughter of the elf that the father of Artemis knows really good. What are the odds?! They become best friends (Stockholm syndrome maybe?!) An whole fleet of elves come to rescue the elf by:1. Creating a time loop thing around the house that eats elves?!\n2. Sending in a dwarf that steals the magic thing from Artemis his own house (?!) and gives it to Artemis because they are also suddenly best buddies.\n3. Sending in a troll that destroys everything in his path. Also the elf they came to rescue could die by it.They defeat the troll. Artemis his elf friend uses her magic and the magic thing to beam Artemis father up. Then they want revenge. The dwarf is in superguarded prison on purpose and tells this whole story. Nobody knows why. Artemis rescues dwarf. Film ends.",

            "content": "I love movies. I love books. I love Disney. So I had high hopes when Disney made a movie from a book series I liked. What could go wrong? A lot, apparently.\nI don't need the movie to be a carbon copy of the book to like it. Some stuff that works in books does not work on screen and movies can create the visual spectacular and action sequence that books can't do as well. Problem is when they choose to make a movie based on a book, take the heart of the story and then completely mangle it. Disney could have taken a perfectly good recipe and turn it into gold, even create their own storyline for Artemis's next adventure, but they choose to remove what makes the books a classic which are the characters and how they develop.\nI quickly realised in the first 10 minutes that it's not going to be at all like the book. Visually, it's great. Ireland is beautiful. Haven is suitably high-tech. The action sequence is fun. They changed the characters and some of it works. Foaly is now a snappy dresser. Root is Judi Dench, but hey, why not? Mulch is funny and now a giant dwarf (guess they really really want Josh Gad to play it and then ran out of money to make him small). They made Butler and Artemis Sr more people-friendly and family-oriented, which I guess I can let go. Holly Short now has a backstory.\nKoboi is apparently Darth Vader now (so not a surprise if she is going to be Artemis' mother or closely related to it) because you know, let's make it really obvious she's a villain... a cute girly pixie apparently just doesn't cut it.\nMain problem is Artemis is just not Artemis in this Disney version, and it's very difficult to move away from that if you've read and loved the books. In the books, Artemis was a gazillionaire genius kid, super-formal and exacting but socially awkward and clumsy, who is also a loyal brilliant strategist and mastermind trying to save his father, then mother, then the fairy world. Disney mixed a bit of Alex Rider in and deleted quite a bit of Artemis Fowl and made him a gazillionaire supersmart rude teen, who can now fight and shoot, trying to save his father. So like any other teen action movie, with leprechauns, fairies, dwarfs and trolls thrown in.\nIt's probably a good movie for young kids, who don't care for dialogue or character development, and like pretty pictures on screen. Probably not if the kid is a fan of the book and the characters.\nMaybe I need to watch the movie again and pretend I've never read the book. Right now, it kinda still pisses me off they made Artemis wear a T-shirt and sneakers!",

They completely changed Artemis entire personality; he is supposed to be a criminal mastermind, but he barely seems like he could successfully plan to steal a kid's bicycle. He's just a boy who is supposedly super smart, but the only reason you know this is because someone else says it about him. And for some reason instead of taking the wonderful, intricate heist storyline that Colfer wrote in the books, they conjured up a villain from a future book in the series... except they didn't even explain who THAT character was or what their motivation was to do what they did.\nI don't think I have ever been as disappointed by an adaptation of a book as I was by this drivel. If you have never read the books, you probably won't understand what the heck is going on. If you have read the books, you will understand just enough to be disgusted by the horrible things they have done to it because you know how much better it should have been.\nI usually try to separate a film adaptation from a book and judge it on it's own merits, but the only reason I sort of understood what was happening is because I knew what happened in the books.

            "content": "What the film should be - Die Hard with Faries\nWhat we got - Spy Kids franchise wannabeThis film is absolutely one of the worst adaptations I've ever seen, in fact - its not even really an adaption - instead it reads like someone skimmed the Wikipedia article of Artemis Fowl (the plain English film), then proceeded to binge watch the Spy Kid films before writing this. In case its not clear, I am a big fan of the books, I grew up with them to an extent, I should also be clear that I guess young kids are the target market, but anyway, let the salt begin!The Characters\nArtemis FowlWhat he should be: Evil, almost always in a suit and always in controlWhat is he in the film? Irremediably ruined, seen surfing on the Irish waves in the first few moments, turned into a bland kid who is introduced to fairies by his daddy, has no rapport with Butler, seen engaging in hand to hand combat with fairies, takes his sunglasses off and calls Holly a friend in no time.\nCharacter Assassination marks - 10/10ButlerWhat he should be: Suited, booted, awesome, the ultimate bodyguardWhat is he in the film? Irremediably ruined, race-blended for some reason, hardly effective in any scene, holds no human weaponry throughout the entirety of the film, seen crying in several scenes, hugs Artemis Fowl, FML...\nCharacter Assassination marks - 10/10HollyWhat she should be: The first LEP female officerWhat she is in the film? Not the first LEP female officer, has a dumb side-story about her father betraying her people, does not use an awesome LEP gun, constantly looks aimless and stupid, scenes of her flying and saluting are the dumbest thing, calls Artemis Fowl friend, oh make it stop...\nCharacter Assassination marks - 9/10Commander RootWhat HE should be: Cigar chewing police boss with a mean attitude and a secret heart of goldWhat he is the film: The magnificent dame Judi Dench doing a hilarious Irish accent and wearing emerald green, never smokes a cigar.\nCharacter Assassination marks - 12/10Other CharactersFoley - Should be the fairy version of Q, brilliant, paranoid and seen wearing a tin-foil hat. Is none of these things but watching the centaur effects had mean in gales of laughter.\nMulch Diggums - A completely unnecessary narrator but probably the most accurately captured character from the books. Character Assassination marks - 6/10\nBriar Cudgeon - I'm not going to either bother\nArtemis Fowl Snr - Colin Farrall as the doting father and art-collector who teaches little Arty-Warty all about the fairies and the people. Does not get kidnapped by the Russian mafia in the Bay of Kola. Is most certainly not a criminal mastermind\nJuliet Butler - 21 in the books and generally awesome. Race-bended, turned into a teen side-kick and useless for the movie purposes except the demographics.\nAngeline Fowl - A crucially important character from the book, completely AWOL in this adaptionWhat else is not in the film?\nA cool opening in VietnamThe Fairy BookAcornsMagic (lets be fair, its hardly in it)'I don't even like lollipops'Butler in a suit of amour with a mace taking on a troll (among many other things)Criminal mastermindsGuns, explosions,I digress, but at least they added a magical magufin (the AXIOM) which everyone is after, and loads of fancy CGI (some of it quite stylish and cool), the time stop is initially cool but I don't really 'get' what is going on at the end, its very stupid and confusing (I mean, forget how cool and technical it is in the book, remember Santa?).I'm exhausted now, I can't wait for the YouTube videos covering this, bravo Disney, you took a beloved franchise with great potential for smart, family entertainment and trashed it so completely it will be remembered only along with the other stalwarts of Eragon, Last Airbender, Hungry Cities and so forth.",

Why not make the movie FROM THE BOOK? The suave coolness and sheer genius of Artemis, that mystery and wonder that I felt reading the first book of \"who is this kid!?!?\" - it was absolutely deflated by the movie introducing him as just a kid trying to figure out what happened to his dad who by the way left just like yesterday. And meanwhile Josh Gad as Mulch is giving a step by step play by play narrative which is supremely unnecessary and a bit awkward.

            "content": "I grew up reading these books! They inspired my love for the fantasy genre and provided my love for learning and wit. But this movie was plain aweful. When I heard Disney was making this movie, I was so excited. But then as I watched, the truth became clear that it wouldn't be even close to my bar for a passable movie.Let me explain exactly what's wrong with this movie:The movie was allover horrible. The whole movie felt like it was catering to young children who can't wait around for plot to progress. Each scene jumps from one to the next without any suspense or sense of urgency and planning. The whole movie had an aura of being rushed and shambled together. Nothing truely felt cohesive. Each event happened back to back to back with no repreave or build up.Artemis Fowl is supposed to be a genius with a plan for everything. And even when something goes wrong? He's got the wit to find a way out. But in this movie, he comes off more like a whiney and pretentious brat. The only recognizable part of this character is the iconic suit and sunglasses.Holly Short didn't feel like her spunky self, and only came across as ditzy and mediocre at best. She wasn't this strong character that she was in the books, and it truely felt like a crime to her character.They genderswapped commander Root, one of my favorite characters. I love Judy Dench as an actress, but she added nothing to the character and felt like a cheap virtue-signalling substitute. She felt very 2D and shallow as a character, which made me very upset. But that doesn't even get to what made me the most angry, oh no.They F'd up Buttler. My hands down favorite character was broken down into the butt of the jokes. They reffused to pay homage to the book and insisted that \"Anyone who reffered to him as Buttler would surely regret it\" and proceeded to call him Dom the entire movie. Normally, that wouldn't be too bad. But they also made him into the emotional character of the movie, which isn't nessicarily bad if his character wasn't supposed to be someone who we know and loved because he had the emotions of a rock. The man's emotions in the books were so complex and had to be earned to witness. But in this trainwreck of a movie, they even gave him the painstaking \"I'm not gunna cry\" line.-They made Opal more comparable to the lovechild of Skeletor and Dr. Evil.She was evil for evil's sake and no more. They even gave her the generic \"I'm going to take over the world\" schpeel.But there is one thing I can say that's good about the movie. The special effects were neat. But that's it. Everything else made me want to carve my soul out with a dull fork. Please don't watch this movie, go pick up the book",

Opal is some form of weird evil fairy, Artemis has absolutely no character similarities with the book and, most important, Butler is just a boring sidekick character. I was hoping for the troll fight at least but no, that would probably be too much to ask.So, in the end, it is watchable, but a great diappointment on almost all levels.\nWhich is really sad because the books are great and fun and the characters have depth and development there.",

They expect to make a sequel but most reviews are horrible so that adds the effect that we never get to know how it ends. The only good representation of this beloved series is the character names and the kidnapping. I can not believe I looked forward to this. Every line of dialogue enraged me, what is this about aculos, why would Julius root be female and not cast Judi Dench, and why did the producers put a small version of hagrid in this? At times I thought he was going to say Harry instead of Artemis. I mean, I can speak for the reviewers when I say this movie was one of the worst movies I have seen in a while.

            "content": "So to start, this film does have some things going for it. There is generally good production value throughout. It is visually appealing and looks cool in its, limited, locations. And, there is generally solid acting; none are amazing, yet none terrible and Artemis is a sometimes compelling lead.Now for the much greater negative portions of this movie. I can't hate on the plot because of the books plot since I never read the book(s). But, there are issues with character development, plot transitions, and emotional weight; however, I will not dive too deep into these since all share the same root issue: the rushed feeling of the movie. The story is compressed into a measly 1.5 hours and its painfully ruinous. Characters are supposed to capture our emotions and attachment after only a few interactions; far to little time and dialogue is invested into making the audience care. As a result, scenes that should hol weight don't, and you feel little to no emotions when you should. The plot itself is only decent and falls prey to many clich\u00e9s and predictable turns, but the compressed, rushed nature exasperates many problems. Jumping from scene to scene not only made it hard to connect with the characters, it made the plot feel disjointed and hard to follow. Locations suddenly shift, plans come into existence, and bonds are formed with far too little screen time and dialogue to make sense of it all, again removing some of the weight from scenes.Overall, good aspects carry this film to its minimum score and it is heavily weighed down by its negatives. But, against all odds, it was mildly entertaining throughout and mostly held my attention.",

            "content": "YOU WILL HATE THIS MOVIE.I am absolutely disgusted at how they butchered the books. Beyond fuming. They murdered my childhood in the name of Disney!Let me try to list some of the ways in which they committed this atrocity against the books (contains spoilers, and in no particular order):Artemis Fowl would never go surfing! He was not an athletic child. He would not be surfing, or hoverboarding or whatever that thing was. He rarely participated in physical activity, letting Butler do the heavy lifting, while he used mere intelligence. He would be absolutely USELESS in physical combat.In the books, Arty's father was a master criminal, but not a particularly great one. And he had NOTHING to do with the fairies. Artemis believed in the fairies. He tracked down a sprite in the human world, and gained access to the secret book. He created a computer program which cracked the fairy code. He was trying to uphold and restore the criminal name of Fowl by pulling off the biggest heist of all time: stealing fairy gold. His father doesn't come into actual play until book two, and he has nothing to do with the fairy world. He was kidnapped by plain old humans.\nThey rewrote Gnomish. Yes, I can still read the fairy code. And they changed the characters for the letters.\nAngeline Fowl is NOT dead in the books. She is in severe emotional distress, and out of her head over the loss of her husband. She is delusional, drifting in and out of the past and present, barely recognizing her son. Artemis carefully keeps her condition hidden, so he can continue with his criminal dealings unchecked. She plays a very large role in Artemis's character development.Juliet Butler is Domovoi's sister, not niece, and she's 16. She wants to be a professional wrestler.A Butler NEVER reveals his or her first name to his charge/employer. A Butler's first name is only revealed when they are dying or dead.Commander Julius Root was male in the books. Constantly angry, turned purple in the face when angry (earning the nickname Beetroot), and was infamous for smoking noxious fungus cigars. Holly Short was the ONLY FEMALE IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE LEP! By making Root female and adding other female officers to the force, they completely invalidated Holly as a character, and her mentor/mentee relationship with Commander Root. So much of Holly's motivation comes from her desire to prove herself as the first ever female LEP officer. Holly's father was not a traitor. Root rides Holly much harder than the other officers because he is trying to help her prove herself, and keep her ever precarious position on the force. He endorses her repeatedly, as the first and only female officer. He is like a father figure to her.WHAT THE HELL IS AN ACULOS?!? Did not exist in the books. And Opal Koboi doesn't come into play until book 4.Mulch Diggums is supposed to only BARELY pass as human. They made dwarves way too human. He also enters the house through the wine cellar. They completely cut, changed, or vagued up other dwarf abilities. Beard hair that can be shaped, and then holds shape when plucked, perfect for picking locks. It also acts as antennae, picking up vibration underground, a kind of dwarf sonar. Dwarf spit, which hardens and glows in the dark. Dwarves are also EXTREMELY sun sensitive. Dwarves are able to absorb moisture through their pores, and can essentially spider man over/up any surface due to this ability. Mulch escapes by faking his own death, slipping the contact into the eye of a rabbit, killing it and faking a cave in.Cudgeon joins with Opal AFTER he is humiliated during the failed rescue attempt of Holly Short. Artemis succeeds, by successfully kidnapping a fairy, and negotiating for Holly's return. He receives fairy gold as ransom, and successfully escapes the bio bomb, out witting the fairies at almost every turn.Holly was supposed to be at Tara performing the ritual to refresh her magic, by burying an acorn under the light of the full moon. She was captured because she was unable to use magic. As the books put it, she was not, \"running hot.\"Butler takes on the troll alone, and almost dies for it. Holly ACCIDENTLY heals him, and he then takes down the troll, after Holly fights it. Holly swoops in and saves him, after escaping by tricking Juliet and using the mesmer effect on her.Artemis and crew escape the time freeze and bio bomb by doing the impossible: falling asleep. The fairies planned to kill them all and take the gold back once Holly was recovered. Humans, fairies, living creatures cannot fall asleep when in a time freeze. Not if they were awake when it is implemented. Artemis and his associates escape the time freeze and bio bomb (which decimates ALL living things) by taking sleeping pills. He used his mother Angeline, to test the theory when the time freeze was first activated.These are just a few main points. If you loved the books, don't waste your time on this movie. If you've never read the books, have fun. Just know, this movie has little to nothing to do with the wonderful series written by Eoin Colfer",

            "content": "Possibly the worst adaptation from a book I've ever seen. The books are very funny and quirky and unique with a sharp edge and a nice dose of silliness, aptly described as 'die hard but with fairies'. This film was a sirupy, bland, tacky, cheesy mess that would have seemed out of date if played on CBBC in the 1980s (don't know if cbbc existed then but you get the picture). This could have been the start of a brilliant and hilarious fantasy franchise that really championed the Irish humour and folklore. Instead it was a catastrophe.Artemis himself: in the book a cold hearted anti hero, who at 12 years old, only ever wears a suit and outwardly feels no empathy and scorns at any sort of emotion. Only starts to soften in book two, but only a little. And an actively practicing high level criminal. In the film, a playful kid who loves surfing and outward bound activities and sentimentally listening to his father reading him fairytales - and who is appalled when the TV news calls his father a criminal.And aside from that so many things, why is Mulch tall and with a height complex? Where did that come from? And why do they all become friends so fast? There's generally a lot more narky taking the piss and being rude to each other in the books, replaced by doe eyed, heart warming long looks and emotional music here.The main problem, why didn't they just adapt the first book, rather than try and squeeze half baked elements of the second book? The evil child genius discovers the existence of the fairies and plots to kidnap one of them to steal their secrets, he does so and there's a frenzied rescue mission. That is more than enough. Instead they added in an honourable father rescue mission and introduced a half baked version of Opal Koboi (what a waste of a cracking villain introduced in book 2, the vain, high pitched narcissist beautiful pixie turns into an anonymous hooded villain with a distorted voice)These books are brilliant. Get your kids to read them, read them to your kids, read them yourself as an adult, such a shame they butchered them in this catastrophe of a film that could have been so much better!",

Just...wow.Artemis Fowl is a complete departure from the books. Fine. Ok. The trailers gave me a heads up on that so all the movie needed to do was be good. And by \"good\" I mean be entertaining and coherent.But it wasn't. It can't. And it only has itself to blame.Abandoning the books' arcs meant completely rewriting the story: People's relationships, their motives, their arcs, and their major plot points. This might have been fine, except it comes off feeling as though they're rushing to cram several stories into this one movie.If they were planning to stick to the source material, I could kind of understand why they might do that; after all, the movie would probably be seen by people who'd read the books, and they'd forgive the plot holes and badly done exposition because their knowledge of the books would fill in the gaps.But this movie's writers and directors knew this movie wasn't for people who'd read the books, because they were the ones who rewrote and directed it! So the movie must be for people who are completely unfamiliar with the books. Right?Except it can't be for them because the movie's idea of world building and story telling is to rush from one character introduction and one situation to the next... as if the viewer already knows who these characters are and what they're doing, so let's get on with it thank you very much.So who's this movie for? It's directed with a nod and wink as though it's made specifically for people who love the books. But it abandoned the source material, so fans of the books are just as in the dark as people meeting these characters for the very first time.It's not for kids. There's just to much new information to absorb in such a short amount of time. So we're back to the same problem of making a movie as though it's an homage to the books, but making the creative choice to make the movie nothing like the books.Could've been great. Could've at least been FUN. But it was neither. It was a mess.In trying to make a movie for everybody, they made a movie for nobody.",

It is so completely absurd that I may have hurt myself rolling my eyes so much. Case and point: When Artemis' father gets kidnapped, Artemis figured out that clues must be in this journal because of a bedtime story that his dad reads to him every night. (Not past tense, present tense) But just before that, we are told that the dad is almost always away...Point number two: We are told that Artemis is a genius and never actually shown that he is. There is no lead up to this claim. Which in turn, makes him out to be this pretentious, condescending, know-it-all.

            "content": "The basic story is there, the kidnap of Holly, the seige of fowl Manor but the reasons for it are changed from villain artemis just wanting gold to a need to save his father. Artemis is played fairly well, but his personality is so different, he is no villain and will not get the chance to grow to be a hero like in the books due to Disney being gutless and not making him the villain of film 1 like he was in book 1. Butler is under used and isn't called butler but just to annoy the fans is called by his first name domovoi. Juliet is not his niece not sister, why? Root is played well if you can ignore the gender swap. Holly is played well as is mulch but they are both to tall, like all the elves in the LEP in fact, almost like Disney didn't want to spend money on effects to make them the right 1 meter height. Foaly is under used so much due to the run time. The action is solid as are the special effects. The run time is way to short. So much was cut even from the trailers, obviously Disney decided to ignore all the adult fans who have loved the books for 20 years and aim it at young kids, so we have a short run time with lots of action but little character development. It's a shame because when the film makers respect the source we get both adults and kids enjoying it like with Harry Potter. With this film it will be enjoyed by kids but hated my many, many fans of the books. If a sequel is made they will need to learn from their mistakes and get a better director than KB who needs to stick to classics and Shakespeare. Haven City looks the part but again is under used. I didn't hate it but I didn't really enjoy it, I hope it gets a sequel or the rights are given to amazon prime or Netflix to make a TV series which often are better than films ( eg. Alex rider, Northern lights)",

And I'm glad I did because it was a pretty great film.I went into this not knowing what exactly I was getting into, but within the first 10-15 minutes I knew I wanted to see how it was going to turn out.Without giving anything away the film follows Artemis Fowl who is searching for his lost father. He is aided by an ensemble of a great group of characters that add to the story of the film. The film looks incredible, I was impressed by the visuals when watching in 4K with HDR. The cinematography team nailed it with this one. The story was likable and entertained both me and my eight year old brother.The film was really well made and is fun to watch. Admittedly I may not feel the same way if I was a fan of the book series, but for those who are unfamiliar with it (like myself) I would certainly recommend watching this film. As a filmmaker I have watched a lot of movies, many of which can be dull and hard to watch. However, Artemis Fowl succeeds in entertaining the audience while still being a high quality film.So maybe this isn't the film for you, that is ok. But if you're looking for a fun movie that is perfect for any family or movie lover, give this film a shot.",

This......atrocity is no Artemis Fowl movie, and is painful to view for a multitude of reasons.Characters are introduced with barely any screen time and the flimsiest of narratives, most are pointless loose ends that only serve as jumping points for a sequel, and things like character development or relationship-building has been tossed to the wayside - but with nothing in its place. Core characters have been shattered and mutilated beyond recognition, and it spoils the essence of Artemis Fowl Jr. in the most casual manner.A key facet of Artemis is his arrogance, his ego. He is a driving force, master manipulator, socially inept, physically useless. Whatever wimpy, sporting, foot-stamper I just exposed my eyeballs to was *nothing* like that, and that's a major catastrophe for not just this movie but the entire franchise. Book-wise, Artemis learns about fairy folk independently. He is obsessed with finding his father and funding further research into discovering them. He is an uncaring, unsympathetic character who steals a copy of the Fairy holy book in order to exploit the Fairy people, beat them at their own game, and steal a metric tonne of gold for the purpose of reinflating his wallet. His father was a cold, hardened, high-profile criminal who never gave Artemis as much as a supporting pat on the back - and all of these character aspects are what made the book phenomenal. The entire series deals with character development within adolescence and early adulthood, but also the notion that regardless of how much brain power you have, Butler will not always be around to save him, and this you need a support network.Which brings me to another point - potentially trivial but bothers me massively nonetheless. Butlers name is Domovoi. Artemis does not know this. In Book3 (The Eternity Code) his name is only revealed when literally dying in Artemis' arms. This was a huge and emotional moment, that makes NO sense now thanks to it being revealed right off the bat. For a movie that was practically screaming \"SEQUEL SEE THERE WILLBE A SEQUEL ITS NOT OVER SEQUEL SEQUEL\", they sure did trash a whole load of plotline and development that could have been sequel material.Aside from the glaring plot disparities, unenthusiastic performances, total lack of on screen chemistry or emotion, and dreadful CGI (lookin' at you, Mulch) - the whole movie makes limited sense, the aesthetics are basic and repetitive, the score is simply filler and is as bland as plasticine, and humour is lacking even I'm funny moments.It's a good job I never have to subject myself to the tripe and drivel that spewed forth from my television, and I'm confident in saying that there wont be another one to follow.

This Christmas, I was back to my parents place, and while passing next to the bookcase, I got a glimpse of the first book. Then I decided to read it again just to have something to pass my time back home. I ended up reading the first two books of the series in three days and I enjoyed every moment of it (I am 30 years old).\nSo you can imagine my excitement when in January I noticed that there was a movie coming up from Disney. I saw the trailer and it really looked like they had done a good job. Yesterday, I watched the movie and from the first minute I had this feeling that this will not go well. Indeed, through the whole movie, one question was always on my mind: \"Why?\".\nFirst of all, the story-line has been altered quite a lot in comparison to the books. While this could generally be accepted since it is a book adaptation, it seems that they just added a lot of unessential information which just puzzled the viewer to understand what was happening in 1.5 hour running time. There was no build-up of the story, the narration of Mulch was at least annoying and unnecessary, the acting was at best mediocre, while there was a constant try to present clever and fun puns (which admittedly they managed a couple of times).\nGenerally, it seemed like a movie that they decided to invest on the CGI and not the plot and actors. Even the CGI I didn't really find it to fulfil really high standards.\nI don't think that my discomfort was coming from the fact that I have read the books. I believe that even someone that had no clue of the story and watched the movie, could only say that this was just a really bad movie. I cannot help to feel really disappointing, as I feel that they took a story with the highest potential and basically ruined it.",

They could have had an amazing movie on their hands. The books are great and I loved them when I was younger. But Disney chose to go the more profitable route of pitching it to children instead of us who are adults and loved the book, and who are also able to post reviews online. Please don't listen to the trolls who are saying it is the worst movie ever, it really isnt. But I hope that it could inspire kids to want to read the way better movies like Harry Potter did. Again I am disappointed at what this movie could have been but don't listen to the haters and give it a shot. Especially if you have kids, because at the end of the day they will enjoy it and not be so freaking critical! I am glad that I didn't pay money to see this in the theater though. Hope Disney keeps releasing movies they aren't 100 percent sure of on the streaming service. More new content to kill the time",

I read the synopsis for the movie and the plot sounded good so I decided to check it out. I haven't read the books but I do want to read them just because the plot sounds good. The movie just made me feel like I missed something. I was confused because Artemis is supposed to be some kind of genius and when he had his \"plan\" I was questioning his genius because it wasn't there. He didn't plan anything that would make me believe this kid was a supposed genius type. Holly literally became friends with Artemis as he had just kidnapped her...uh why? Even Mulch randomly appears in the house and suddenly becomes friends with the whole \"gang.\" And when Butler dies...there was just me going \"are you serious?\" Cause Artemis has no emotion for when the butler guy dies and neither does holly and the scene did not make me sad, it just made me go oh...they aren't going to kill a character off, though and lo and behold they didn't because holly got her magic unblocked and was able to save butler. Eh..ok then. Yeah this movie just made me literally think, \"what did I just watch?\"",

(Not to mention the fact that Butler would never allow anyone to refer to him as \"Dom\") but that's not why I hated it.The acting was objectively bad. I realise the kids are young, but that's not an excuse. It was as though it was their first time reading the script.The characters made decisions that no real person would ever make. Holly Short goes from captive to friend in a matter of seconds.No explanation as to the boundaries/capabilities of magic. No explanation as to how the time stop works or why it's supposed to be such a big deal when it breaks.We were supposed to be invested when a character looks like they're on the brink of death, but we've been given no reason to care and no reason to think they're actually going to die.The book gave plenty of explanations as well as more realistic motivations for all of the actions taken.This film has inspired me to go back and reread the series, as a way of purging the memory of this insult to the books.This is the worst film I can remember seeing.I went into this film wanting to love it, especially since I, like many fans, have been waiting nearly 20 years for it. The first 15 minutes was awful. And it only got worse.The people at Disney need to learn how to tell a story, and maybe take a writer/director who cares about the source material.So many iconic moments were missing.\n\"Stay back human: you don't know what you're dealing with.\"",

I have read the original book, and the rest of the series, and they are all witty and tightly plotted.Eoin Colfer's own description of the book was \"Die Hard with Fairies\" and that does nicely explain the fun feel of the novel\nThe film is none of these things.\nIt is obviously very difficult to adapt a book for a film, the issues of length alone can be insurmountable, however, that isn't really an excuse for mashing (I think) three of the original books together, then completely changing the character of the protagonist (books - think Lex Luthor in a world without Superman. Film, goodness knows what!) The character of Artemis' father doesn't appear in the first book, presumably they got Colin Farrell so decided to shoehorn him in for no good reason. The fact he had absolutely nothing to do can be glossed over, right?\nSo, really difficult to review the film without bemoaning the evisceration of the source material. However, there are specific weaknesses. Artemis himself, I'm sure Robert Shaw's relative is a fine actor, but given what he had to work with he was awful here. Holly should have been cast with an adult and digitally made smaller. All due respect the actor isn't mature enough to catch the nuances. Foaly, the centaur, also has nothing to do, and the centaur CGI was done better in Hercules the Legendary Journeys twenty odd years ago. If you feel your film needs an interminable narration throughout you've probably messed up the script.\nDame Judi Dench, as always, was good.\nIf you liked the books - Avoid.

However, they leave much of that, as well as further adventures and stories, for future films to delve into. Shows strong bonds of family and friends. With an overarching positive moral tone. Enjoyed Josh Gad as Dwarfus Giganticus immensely!!",

            "content": "I actually watched the whole movie last night with 12 and 14 year old who are avid AF fans for 7 years. I haven't read the books myself but listen to several as audiobooks while shuttling kids around. I have watched it at 142\" home theater with decent audio. Let me share what an average viewer who is not AF superfan can think about this movie.At the time when there is a complete drought of new movies this was actually fairly entertaining film for me and my kids. I would rate it 3.5-4 stars. Definitely something family can watch together for relaxing evening without violence, innuendoes or bad language. The movie is 135 min long which is just right. The fact that the story is narrated by Munch is weird and somewhat distracting but explained at very end. The story is easy to follow and simplified from the books (i found the books somewhat weird and it took my a while to figure out the book world).The acting is fine, even though the creators missed some opportunities to make the characters, especially AF and Butler more memorable. The special effects are well done and the fairy world as well as AF mansion have high production values. We actually quite liked the characters of Holly Short and Munch, even though Munch's portrayal is too close to HP Haggrid.My kids who have AF memorized immediately commented that the story is different from the book but that didn't stopped them from enjoying the movie. We had several good laughs, there was some good suspense and action for them (the troll scene, the final battle) and after the movie was over we had goo discussion what was different from the books and what worked well and not so well. We are hoping there will be a sequel as there is not enough characters and stories like this for kids.Finally, if you have Disney+ you get this movie at no additional cost and its production value, story telling and world portrayal is much better and original than most other traditional Disney movies. Give it a chance and watch it with open mind and you may just find you will enjoy it.",

            "content": "While I have never read the books, I went in with high hopes for this movie. With leads Josh Gad, Dame Judi Dench, and Colin Farrell, a huge fan following for the books, and what seemed to be a really cool new universe to discover, I was pretty excited we were going to get to see it on Disney Plus for free!All of this being said, the production value, effects, cast, and music are the only reason this gets an extra star. You can tell this could have been an amazing story, but the lack of exposition, storyline, and character development are too glaring to be overlooked.As someone who cried at the drop of a hat and can develop empathy for almost any character with even a small bit of good character development, I was shocked by my own reaction when a character that I should have cared about literally died and I felt nothing. I didn't tear up, didn't have an ounce of emotion for him. What should have been an impactful moment and an amazing celebration right after, meant nothing.Major holes and issues:\nDevelopment between Artemis and Dom. They seemingly have a Bruce Wayne/Alfred relationship, but we wouldn't know for sure because they're not developed at all.Artemis is very well trained, he and Dom take on an entire fairy squad in their own. How? How and when was he trained? We just assume he's trained because Dom is trained? This literally could have been solved by a two minute montage in the morning of Dom waking up Artemis and saying, \"Let's go, time for daily training.\" And training being interrupted by the phone call from the bad guy.Artemis says \"We need the suit\". The suit has never been previously revealed and we don't know what it does. Is the suit magic? Does the suit have magical powers? What?The fairy world's feelings towards Holly. We have one guy in the whole movie who expresses animosity towards Holly, yet when she gets an assignment and praise at the end, you can tell that's impactful for her.... but it isn't for us. Again, could've had a moment where she goes for a salute and no one salutes back, or a group of fairies calls her a traitor in the street scene.Why does Artemis asking Holly \"Can I trust you?\" And Holly responding with what she said warrant him removing his glasses and blindly trusting her? You could've had her have a breakdown and cry over her father and saying how she wants to prove his innocence and him feeling and understanding that and then sharing his story too. Leaving his glasses on until after they share a moment when Holly saves Dom, which also could have happened and been another impactful moment. EMOTION. MOTIVATION. DEVELOPMENT.Juliet. Zero purpose. Served absolutely no purpose. Why was she there? To do the butler duties Dom is supposed to do? Because all she did was bring people food. And the fairies just let her hang out at the tower during the whole battle. Convenient.Why did they say Dom hated being called a butler, but there's never a pay off for that? Diggum knew that, great opportunity for a comedic moment. We got nothin.There were so many other issues, too many to name, but they dropped the ball on this movie. I get this was a movie aimed at kids, but as so many adults read this book and fell in love too, this was really a disservice to them. Feel bad for the fans of the book...",

            "content": "The reason why I say this is because:\n1. The main antagonist: There is no background to the charactar which explains the reason why she wants to teleport her army. The only thing they tell you is that\" she is one of the smartest fairies who turned evil\". And thats all! ( I just wished they developed her charactar more throughout the movie)\n2. The main protagonist: Ferdia Shaw who plays Artemis Fowl jr lacks emotion among other things. For eg. When Butler died I cringed so hard that scene because the actor needed to cry that scene but he just ended up looking constipated. I could help but laugh and cringe at the same time. Conclusion: Ferdie in my opinion was the biggest problem in this movie because he is the main charactar but doesn't know how to act PERIOD\n3. Overall charactar development: This was also a big problem which also annoyed me! For eg. Juliet butler ( I dont even know why she was in the movie she had almost no dialogs), Turf Graafmans, Holly Short .... the list cloud go on and on honestly!\n4. THE CGI! They had a 125 Million Dollar buget and the film still ended up looking like PLAY DOH. Okey maybe I'm over exaggerating but I mean come on! They missed a great opportunity to make a GREAT movie. Because the original storyline (in the books) is AWESOME! They just had to add theyr own flair which ultimately ruined the movie!\nConclusion: Its a great movie to watch IF YOUR BELOW THE AGE OF 9!!! I wanna see movie refilmed with better actors! I would not recommend this movie to anyone because you may end up cringing so hard that you'll have to use the toilet!!

Sloppy and rushed writing and directing. CGI hidden in shadow a lot of the time. Time was a huge restraint, but so much garbage could have been cut.It's nothing like the books, obviously. Some of the changes had so much potential, and others made it worse.One of the greatest tragedies the movie tried sooooo hard to adopt was Eoin Colfer's seamless mesh of ancient Irish fairy tale magic and science fiction. The movie's compromise was to talk a lot about magic at the beginning with gorgeous shots of Ireland and Irish music, contrasted with Artemis randomly surfing in modern gear. Or, if they talked about magic, it was in hushed voices filled with awe, which actually undermined them as strong characters we could take seriously.Artemis Fowl II, intentions: a professional criminal mastermind, but more likable than in the books\nResult: Artemis is no hardened criminal. In fact, he commits 2 crimes total, both to rescue someone he cares about. Also, just kidding, they totally weren't going for professional, unless that means wearing a suit and calling people. He gives lines that no self-respecting child would, like when his dad is teaching him about fairies: \"All I want...is to believe in YOU.\" While Colfer's Artemis has vampire-pale skin and shuns society, apparently an outdoorsy, surfing Artemis was predicted to be more likable.Domovoy Butler, Artemis' best friend and bodyguard: goes by \"Butler\" in the books to indicate a sense of natural professionalism. In the movie, he goes by \"Dom\" to...indicate their close friendship...?Mulch Diggums, intentions: the comic relief and mysterious narrator.\nResults: 80% of his jokes fell flat, 5% of which were cringey. But that still leaves 20% decent content. He had a confusing role trying to convey mystical secrets and comedy, so either you couldn't take him seriously or couldn't laugh.Artemis Fowl I, father, intentions: give the movie a more clear plot outline than the books and provide a more dynamic familial role than an ailing mother.\nResult: clear plot conflict successful! Took authority from Artemis as being the man of the house. Awkward, unclear relationship.Holly Short, intentions: epic, pretty fighter and Artemis' arch frienemy\nResults: fight scenes good, but there was no reason for Artemis to make himself an enemy. As one of my favorite book characters, she wasn't completely ruined, and it was nice to see her come to life on screen.I don't even know why they introduced Butler's little sister other than to have another POC in the film. Making Commander Root a woman was another easy score for diversity, although it really did work better than the disaster everything else was.You know Chekhov's saying: \"If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired\"? There were dozens of proverbial guns that were immediately fired. A missing fairy journal written by his father... I literally texted my bf, \"All we need are a music box and a key.\" 2 minutes later, with the help of an encoded song, they find the journal. Also, an object is called, \"a skeleton key to the entire universe.\" Yeah, not dramatic at all. I can only thank heaven that there was not a romantic interest.",

The book is based on the very simple fact that Artemis is, actually, the bad guy. He extorts and kidnaps fairies, showing no emotion except when it comes to his mom. the version of Artemis we get in this movie is so badly written it's so hard to watch.I can give credit to few scenes such as Holly leaving Haven City and fighting the Troll. But that's 3 minutes of it. Foaly is useless and lacks the humour He is supposed to have. Mulch Diggums however has some nice moments, but damn the visual effects are not on point.As always the story is the key of a movie, and here, it's pure garbage : the fact that they needed a character to do the narrator during the whole movie is an admission of their failure.Kenneth Branagh shows that book adaption is not his strongest point.Disney, please, stop books adaptations, thank you.",

Ror someone who has never read the books, it sets up a clear introduction to the principles of the world. Movies like Bright failed in some sense because the mythos was never clear. The special effects are used well - while not being truly unique, they serve the story well.

I do like the idea of telling the story from Mulch Diggums point of view... the books took the position of writing from a doctor trying to understand the character and motives of Artemis Fowl, but other than that...The script was like trying to watch a 3 hour movie at double speed. There is so much that just disappointed... The fact that Angeline Fowl (His mother) is dead makes the potential for future movies impossible.

Example Artemis wouldn't Surf, he was a criminal mastermind in the body of a kid, Butler was Butler and suppose to be the likes of inhuman juggernaut. The only character that was close to the books was Juliet in her 15seconds. Story content mixed and matched excerpts from different books creating inconsistencies (pick one story and run with it). And stay closer to the books and what made Artemis who he was. Had so much potential to be a great film series But falls short next time read the books.",

Great effects.That's it.I've not read the books, but this ranks as #2 as one of the worst films I've seen. #1 worst is A Wrinkle in Time. No character development at all. No back stories. I'd have appreciated an additional 30 minutes if the story were actually developed. It shows like trying to cram 4 novels into a 90 minute show...which may be what they did.The narration is dumb. Judy Dench did an \"OK\" job (it's hard for her not to act well). Dialog was completely predictable...if you could follow the plot...such as it wasn't.Spoilers. Did I say the CGI was really cool? All the interactions between the humans and fairies seem to be based on some set of undefined/unexplained rules between the species. Oh, by the way, was the point of everything all part of what Artemis planned in order to get to the artifact? Not evident. And then he was surprised it was there? Ok, damage the time thingy and then you have 7 minutes until failure. The fairies break their rules by sending in a troll and then just stand around outside doing squat all. Some of the poorest military strategists in the universe. Oh and a bad guy who tries to take over and then is handily defeated in less than 5 minutes.CGI was very cool but does nothing to elevate this movie from a waste of 90 minutes. Sorry Kenneth, but this script did not elevate this movie at all.",

Since its early arrival on Disney + due to the pandemic, I thought I may give this movie a chance. Having not read the books, I had no expectations.\nA good portion of this movie is narrated by Mulch Diggins played by Josh Gad. I don't mind a little bit of narration in a movie right before an opening title, but the narration in this movie went on for about 20 minutes, even going as far to explain events that were unfolding in front of us. The movie doesn't trust it's audience to understand what is going on.\nThe actor playing Artemis Fowl gave some of the flattest delivery of dialogue I have ever seen. The studio could have gotten a more charismatic performance out of a plank of wood with a happy face drawn on it.\nJudi Dench played her role with what seemed like great reluctance, convincing me that Disney has black mail on her.\nThe movie drags on for the introduction of the main character and rushes through the plot, making it feel rushed and snail-like in its pacing at the same time.\nHalfway through the movie, Artemis kidnaps a fairy to lure the rest of them to his house to find the McGuffin. Only hours later, he releases her and she gives him her unconditional friendship and help in his mission, despite being tranquilized and kidnapped by said friend earlier that same day. Trusting your captor and giving him what he wants is a pretty dangerous lesson to teach anyone, let alone a young impressionable audience that is clearly the target demographic of this movie.\nScarcely any time is spent establishing Artemis and Dovokoi as anything other than an employee/employer relationship making the tension at his near-death implausible, which ended up not mattering since Agent Short (the fairy) just brought him back to life.\nThe movie is sloppily edited and poorly acted that I can't spend any more energy describing it.

But there was no backstory for her and I didn't know why any of the characters did anything. Also, what even was your point of Juliet?? She just showed up to make a sandwich and then be in peril. The movie would've been the same without her which stinks because I feel like she has probably a bigger part in the books.During the movie, I leaned over to my friend to ask if I'd missed something. Neither of us had any idea what was going on, and it felt like we'd watched the movie out of order.

The novels were a delight, and my entire cadre of friends and family loved them.Unfortunately, I'm guessing that the same people who thought smashing together two of the Prydain Chronicles to make The Black Cauldron was an excellent idea must have worked on Artemis Fowl, only they didn't bother reading the novels first, no. They took the summation given to them by their twelve year old for gospel and thought they'd add in a few things while they were at it. Artemis Fowl wouldn't be caught dead surfing or using a PC instead of Apple or... well. Pretty much 95% of what he's done in this movie. Many of the amazing things Artemis did on his own are now attributed to his father, his mother is dead, Juliette is Butler's sister, he knows Butler's name *and calls him by it*, and that's just the tip of this festering iceberg. The actors obviously tried hard, and I have few general problems with their casting (aside from the fact that Juliette should have been quite a bit older). You can only work with what you're given, though, and it's clear that they weren't given much.I'd heard it wasn't very good, but my sister told me I had to watch it so that I could be as infuriated by it as she was. I did, and I therefore quite clearly am precisely that annoyed. This could have been amazing, but they missed the mark by such a wide margin that I'm fairly certain that they were at least a hundred miles away from it to start. What a miserable horror when it could have been so wonderful. It's a horrible shame and I don't recommend it to anyone who's read the novels for certain. Since I also know people who didn't read the novels who have found it equally confusing, I doubt I'd recommend it if you haven't read them, either.",

Especially surprising is that this is brought to us from Disney andA movie version of the Artemis Fowl book has been in and out of production since '01. We finally get it, and wow, this wasn't worth it. This a very disappointing adaptation. Especially surprising is that this is brought to us from Disney and director Kenneth Brannagh (Thor, Murder on the Orient Express, Cinderella).The problem is that this is a bunch of quick short scenes and characters thrown at us one after the other with very little impact. Heck, the character of Artemis' friend Juliet (played by Tamara Smart) feels like an afterthought and barely functioning character, used so sparingly despite being around the main action most of the time.I think there was a lot of trouble in editing and reshoots. There is one very clear moment of poor dub work.The barrage of scenes and characters results in a complete and utter lack of being able to become invested or relate to the characters. The only character who feels completely developed is large dwarf Mulch Diggums (Josh Gad). I feel that Disney may have felt he went best with test audiences and pushed all the attention onto him.The biggest issue is the presentation of Artemis Fowl (Ferdia Shaw) himself. He's a criminal genius in the book, but that isn't well represented here. He's still smart, but the choppy editing doesn't much make it feel like he's a master strategist. He's watered down from an antihero to a more traditional protagonist. It's Pinky, Elmyra, and the Brain all over again. The studio feels that an antihero may not sit well with parents and they water the product down. The director and/or studio also tweak Artemis' backstory, which was a mistake. (There are good movie adaptations where they change things. This just isn't one of them). They give a frustratingly basic and uninvolving story for Artemis. The characters' setup scenes are some of the dullest moments. Plus, the backstory pales in comparison to the original. The movie doesn't seem to have much faith in Artemis as he doesn't even seem to the be the main focus. Shaw also gives a rather dull performance.Last complaint: there are a couple moments that look like they might be death scenes, but I don't think they were supposed to be. It's very poorly handled.To the movie's credit, there is a good line once in a while. Gad and Judi Dench as an elf commander do a good job. Nonso Anozie as Artemis' bodyguard seemed like fun, but he just wasn't given enough attention. Being a Brannagh movie, it looks nice but it doesn't quite compare to some of his other recent works.You can avoid this one, especially if you're a fan of the book. It's not painfully bad, just barely functioning.",

WellThis movie was just strange, when i saw the overwhelmingly negative reviews i thought i would hate this movie when i watched it but i don't. Yes it's a bad movie but almost everything about it was strange.Let's start of with the good. Well Lara McDonnell gave a decent performance as Holly Short, her character had an underdeveloped plot but i liked her performance in the movie. I know i'm in the minority in this but i mostly liked Josh Gad in this movie, yes the narration was unneeded, the grouchy voice was annoying (it's even addressed in the movie) and some of the scenes involving his CGI use was horrible but i enjoyed the charisma and witt he brought in the movie. He played as a tall dwarf and he looked like the only one having fun in that movie so yeah Josh Gad was a silver lining.The concept and potential was there and interesting as well, the first act was not that bad as you are introduced to the other worlds of Artemis Fowl like the fairy kingdom was an interesting concept and the CGI was decent early in the movie too but that potential was never realized. Being a Kenneth Branagh movie some shots looked nice and well directed AT TIMES with some decent set pieces here and there.Now the Bad. Ferdia Shaw who played Artemis Fowl had a hammy performance throughout the movie, at times he seemed too monotone and stoic and the other he seemed to be over-acting, it wasn't a terrible performance as he got a lot better during the third act but that was one of the many problems of the movie. Another problem was how scenes seemed to be stitched together and all over the place. Not to give anything away but the majority of the movie takes place in a House.The runtime is 1hr 30 minutes and it seems some scenes were removed and the pacing was too fast and dodgy as you're not given time to fully flesh out characters and the runtime is just filled with exposition and world building but you're never given time to care about the characters or the plot. Judy Dench also gave a weird performance with a grouchy voice, The CGI got bad real fast and this is a big budget movie mind you especially with some bad action sequences.The heist aspect of the movie took a backseat as most of it was explained through narration which took away any thrill or suspense. The villain was awful as he/she has a generic motivation to take over the world and i don't mind that but there is no backstory or any reason to be invested in the villain so it just ends up being generic movie bad guy 101 oh and he/she has a grouchy voice, i have no idea why this movie had an obsession with grouchy voices.Colin Farrell as Artemis' father had the potential to be an interesting character but as soon as you're introduced to him, he is immediately gone. The adventure aspect is also poorly executed and the way how the main conflict is resolved is just baffling. Like i said the whole movie was strange, Also some scenes drag on and we are talking about a 1hr 30 minute movie here and the story never goes to interesting places and again you never care for the characters. So overall, didn't hate his movie, but it's not a good movie by any means.",

Eoin Colfer should disown this garbage if possible. Only redeeming quality is the personality Josh Gad managed to give to Mulch Diggums, which is why I give at least 1 point.The changes to the original story are so dramatic that it doesn't deserve the title \"adaptation\" anymore, I'm not even sure \"loosely based\" fits here. It's like the people who made the script didn't even bother to read the books, it's like they just heard what the books are roughly about from someone who read them a decade ago. While he was drunk. Then they got drunk and made this.The changes to some of the main characters traits, race and even sex are something I just can't explain and it's really really insulting. Holly should be \"of dark colour\", she is pale white. Domovoi Butler should be - and this is even plot-related - of Russian-Japanese descent, whose family protected Fowls from around year 1100, he is somehow an African (with Slim Shady dyed hair and obvious fake colored lenses.. I mean seriously who came up with that). \"Julius Root\" should be an angry little cigar-smoking man, not a noble misses M from James Bond. Foaly should be old and hairy, not young and metrosexual. And Mulch Diggums (while the actor gave him a lot of personality) should have looked anything but human.Budget for this cringe-worthy Frankenstein monstrosity was around a third bigger than any of the Lord of the Rings movies.

No longer is Artemis a cold, debonair child prodigy; instead, he comes off as a scared boy trying to understand what is happening around him. Fans of Eoin Colfer's writing style will almost certainly be disappointed by this adaptation. The plot comes off as basic and the characters shallow and underdeveloped. The few scenes that do stay true to the series seem to have been taken out of  the various books published in the Artemis Fowl series and mashed together haphazardly. Despite this, I would say the adaptation is a good way to pass time for young children. It certainly keeps their eyes glued to the screen, as you would expect any fantasy-based film with copious amounts of CGI would.

The story has been completely changed from the books it's supposedly based on to the point where it's completely unrecognizable as Artemis Fowl in any sense. The characters have been completely changed as well. Artemis is meant to be 12-year-old criminal mastermind with the disposition of a Vulcan that was well aware of his family's criminal enterprises for his entire life and brought up to eventually take over for his father and keep their criminal empire running. He detested athletic activity and was always extremely formal, constantly wearing suits even in his down time. His father went missing when he was very young, held by the Russian mafia, and it drove his mother insane. He was left to keep everything going and at 12 he kidnapped a fairy and ransomed her for gold. Though the protagonist, in the first book Artemis was very much the villain. In this movie Artemis is clearly just a kid that is smarter than everybody else. They kept his \"kid genius\" trait and removed everything else. His first appearance in the film is him surfing, something the true Artemis would never have done. He's constantly seen in typical clothing you would expect a kid to wear during the first portion of the film rather than his signature suits. His mother is dead and his father is kidnapped by Opal Koboi, the reoccurring villain that was introduced in the second book and had nothing to do with the Fowl family until Artemis II foiled her schemes. Movie Artemis has an emotional outburst when he learned from a news broadcast that his father is suspected of being a criminal and denies the accusations, eventually having to be dragged away by Butler, who in the movie prefers his first name despite it being a major part of his character in the books that his first name is to remain a secret unless he's dying. Butler is the one that introduces Artemis to the reality of faeries, which is what his dad was involved in, rather than Artemis discovering faeries and dragging Butler and Juliet into it with him like in the books. All of the characters have been drastically changed in similar manners, their traits and backstories completely thrown out the window and rewritten. They're mere caricatures of the characters they're supposed to be. Even forgetting that this was supposed to be a book adaptation the movie wasn't very good. The acting is bland and the actors are always either trying too hard or not trying hard enough. The manor is beautiful from the outside but there's far too big a disconnect between the style of the exterior and the style of the interior. The voice over narration by Josh is terrible, far too raspy and often difficult to understand due to that fact. The plot of the movie is very basic and recycled from nearly every hero or spy B movie ever made. The characters are watered down stereotypes with no depth to them at all. All in all, it's just terrible. Disney wasted so much money on a movie that turned out to be complete garbage. If you're thinking about watching \"Artemis Fowl\" my advice would be to just watch Spy Kids or Men in Black again instead. It's basically those two movies combined in the worst ways possible and somehow both of those movies are better films than this one.",

Its MUCH closer to the Original than i thought from the trailers, and to my surprise one can find some hints that they actually read it all, like artemis and holly changing eye colours. (Even this is not book one)Generally, this movie feels like all books cramped in one, if this would have been a series it would have been a whole lot better.The effects are decent but there is, for no reason, too much cgi. cast is actually good but acting always feels wierd because there is no way to properly act on this pace. They barely have any time for caracter development and everything is just too fast to be believable.The main concerns that i still have is Artemis feeling somewhat cringey/not evil enough, and butler is somehow not characterized at all. But if you look closely that all boils down to pace, and that again to cut. The vietnam scene is missing completely despite beeing in the trailers, and thats what makes the movie feel wierd. Half an hour more of seeing artemis and butler carrying out a plan together would have made it all more believable. (Like the goddamn book)And thats sad because some script ideas are actually genius, like mulch acting reminiscent of jack sparrow and the idea that Artemis could have gotten to know Holly a lot better while he kept her jailed, as well as the subplot with her father.

This movie while not a faithful scene by scene replay of the movie is exactly what I was looking for in an Artemis Fowl movie. My 6 year old son and I can not stop watching this movie, he is in love with Mulch Diggums and Officer Holly Short. The main man himself Artemis Jr. delivers his signature cockiness and superiority in a way that doesn't make him out to be a coldhearted criminal which in today's times is definitely not a bad thing.Butler is played in spades as the best friend/surrogate father figure to young Artemis when his father is gone. I tear up every time during his \"scene\" (if you actually watch the movie you know the one)Commander root plays her part wonderfully (I will miss the noxious stogeys this character was known for, but again times we live in) as Holly's protective almost motherly figure, while also cutting her no slackCudgeon is immediately dislikable just like the books and is just as slimy as ever.Even Juliet I believe is played amazingly.All in all I cannot believe most of the reviews about this movie. Do people really want a page for page remake of the book? I for o e did not and am extremely happy with how this turned out. Hopefully some people will read this and actually give the movie the chance it deserves. My son and I eagerly await the next installment in this awesome story",

Artemis comes off as more of an average kid, he panics, runs around screaming and constantly worries about daddy.
