            "content": "\"Woman, what is your problem?\" That is the single thought that kept bouncing around in my head as I watched \"The Turning.\" It was turning me into an angry viewer.\"The Turning\" is a movie based upon the book \"The Turn of the Screws\" by Henry James. Per Wikipedia--the most factual content on the internet...(snicker)--\"His novella The Turn of the Screw has garnered a reputation as the most analysed and ambiguous ghost story in the English language and remains his most widely adapted work in other media.\" The key word is \"ambiguous.\"\"The Turning\" started off strong. The year was 1994 and Kurt Cobain had just died. We had a bright young woman named Kate Mandell (Mackenzie Davis) who had just been hired as a tutor for a young girl named Flora (Brooklynn Prince). Flora was an effervescent little girl with a cute voice and cute smile. Flora's brother Miles (Finn Wolfhard) on the other hand was something entirely different. Besides being mean, disrespectful, and rude, he was borderline psychopathic. The palatial estate Kate was to be staying at was a massive older estate like something from the antebellum east coast.Kate had problems right away with Miles. It wasn't enough to make alarm bells go off, but enough to irritate you. What should have made the alarm bells go off was when Miles and Flora tricked Kate into believing that Flora was drowning. Kate dove into a cold pool in the middle of the night just for their cheap giggles. At that point I would have left. They can find another tutor that is OK with being the back of very serious practical jokes. But no, Kate stayed on the property either as a plot device to give us a movie or out of some moronic sense of commitment.If that twisted joke wasn't enough to make her run off, then the next big brouhaha should've been. Kate had already been having repeated problems with Miles and he didn't hide his disdain for her. On top of that she was seeing paranormal activity which was enough to give any sane person reason to flee. The final straw should have been when she attempted to take the two kids to town. Before she could leave the grounds Flora flipped out and screamed for Kate to stop the car. Miles' next statement was \"Stop the car or I will kill you!\"That's all I needed to hear. I am outta here. Find another adult punching bag. I'm not waiting around to find out if you're serious. Yet, this is where the movie got truly aggravating. If you are a viewer like me who has little patience for people doing stupid and unnecessary things in a scary movie, then you would have been equally frustrated. Kate was not a prisoner. This wasn't her family and we knew very little backstory about her to motivate her to stay. In other words, besides a promise to a little girl, there was no reason for her to stay at the estate and take further abuse. But stay she did and claw at my own face in irritation I did.Kate sank deeper and deeper into a state of fear and unrest and it was written all over her face. With each passing minute and each occurrence I devolved further into a state of angst as I could only silently yell, \"Get a clue and get the heck out!\"Then, as the plot seemed to be finally revealing itself we got the most ambiguous ending you could possibly imagine. This wasn't like \"Inception\" where you're left to wonder if he was dreaming or not, or \"No Country for Old Men\" where you're left wondering if he killed the girlfriend or not, this was like nothing I can think of where you don't know what in the world was going on. I was totally confused. Are there ghosts, are there not, is she crazy, is she not? What just happened? We just went on this 90 minute psychedelic trip and suddenly woke up and nothing is in focus. Such a let down.",

            "content": "My favorite adaptation of this move is the one with Patsy Kensit from the late 80's. Very atmospheric and effective.I found this version adequate until the end. It was so abrupt and veered into such a weird direction that it appeared to be a last minute change that fell beyond flat. The impression I got is they tried to suddenly make it about genetic mental illness rather than an actual ghost story. The last time she looks in the mirror and claims she sees the ghost, there really was nothing there. Then the layered dialog emphasizes something Mrs. Gross just stated about whatever her mother has (mental illness), hopefully she doesn't get it. The kids call her crazy, walk out of the room and the movie's over. Are you kidding?I can't assume this was the direction they were going in the whole time. And a scene from the trailer, in which a large spider is crawling out of the boy's mouth, was not even in the movie, so that points even further towards a change in direction. But whoever decided on this direction made a very bad decision.",

Yawn.\nThe usual ghostly apparitions in mirrors, windows, and in background. Very uncreative, and cheap looking.\nThe usual isolated mansion/house w/lots of rooms w/stuff, and usual dark basement. And, a maze garden. A brief scene of a creepy tree which had no bearing on anything.\nSupposedly scary scenes in which our future victim has portending nightmares, and of course we don't know they're just dreams.\nFuture victim, unfortunately in this genre is female, does not respond intelligently to what's going on.\nEnding, and alternative ending which was worse, was one of those \"viewer decides\" could be anything.",

Unfortunately \"The Turning\" is a poor remake of \"The Innocents\" without any explanation of the original story. The conclusion is ridiculous (or inexistent) and never provides the ambiguity of the original film to the viewer. The performances are not bad bus the screenplay is terrible and forgettable. If the viewer seeks out an explanation for the story, reads the plot and reviews of the original film to understand the plot. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): \"Os Orf\u00e3os\" (\"The Orphans\")",

            "content": "I like horror movies and thrillers, I like modern takes on period pieces and classics, and I like the cast and am a fan of the director's music videos and earlier film work (i.e. The Runaways). So I expected to enjoy this update on The Turn of the Screw. I did not enjoy it, I'm sad to report. There was too little story or suspense to hold one's attention throughout, and that's a shame.The cast certainly did their jobs -- Finn Wolfhard is no longer the nerdy little kid, and Mackenzie Davis was convincing in her role as a driven-to-the-edge tutor -- and it was visually beautiful throughout a lot of the film. But early jump scares suck a lot of the suspense out of it all. And a distinct lack of backstory/characterization leaves way too many questions about what, exactly, there is to be afraid of in the giant, creaky house. The little girl's fears are left unexplained, at least in terms of being satisfactory; the huge personality shift in the boy is sort of waved away; and the many unexplained deaths in the history of the estate are just confusing. I kept wondering if cuts had been made to the script or in the editing room, because things didn't flow at all and it really affected the atmosphere.The ending will drive a lot of viewers to yell at the screen. Our half-full opening night theatre did a lot of groaning and saying, \"You've got to be kidding me!\" as the credits suddenly began to roll. Maybe that finale would've worked better had everything leading up to it actually added up to more...but unless we get a Director's Cut we'll never know. I wish I could recommend this movie. I can't. Not scary, nonsensical, and not enough to be worth the price of admission. -HV",

            "content": "It's an odd feeling when you enjoy a film that everyone else seemingly hated. You feel like you missed something (or saw something that wasn't there to see). While I wouldn't go anywhere near as far as to say I loved 'The Turning', or even that is remotely without fault, I would suggest that an IMDb score of 3.7/10 is a crime.The film is based on the novella 'The Turning of the Screw' which I have never read, nor seen any adaptions of. So this was all new to me. The opening scene in the movie is pretty weak and doesn't get things off to a good start. I say it was weak only because it cuts off so abruptly. It was actually building quite nicely to that point. The opening scene of a horror movie is incredibly important to set the tone for what is to come, so I wish they had extended this a little and made it have more of an impact.Then early on in the film came a jump-scare that completely caught me off-guard and gave me a genuine jolt. It's very rare that a jump-scare catches me by surprise any more, so I have to give the film props for that. Then in the next 5 minutes of runtime they tried about 3-4 more jump scares (a truly odd little cluster of them) and obviously they had no impact because the audience is ready and waiting for them by that point. A little bit of inexperience perhaps showing through from director Floria Sigismondi.Something that really surprised me in this film was the quality of the acting. I make no secret of the fact that I find 95% of child actors very annoying to watch. This film had two of them, Finn Wolfhard and Brooklynn Prince, and both were extremely easy to watch. Take into consideration that the characters they were playing were supposed to be unlikeable and annoying and that makes it even more impressive. Also Mackenzie Davis in the lead role thoroughly impressed me. This is one of the stronger acted horror movies I have seen in recent times.There is a good atmosphere maintained throughout the film, and it all builds towards the ending. I loved the ending. People seem to hate it from what I'm reading, but for me it was the strongest point of the film. It requires some thinking (I had to go back and watch it again to make sure I had it right) but all the clues are there if you're willing to look hard enough. I think people just don't want to think. They want everything handed to them on a silver spoon.It annoys me when audiences hate horror films that try to mix up the formula and do something different, because that is the reason we keep getting the same old stuff over and over again. You can't complain about every horror movie being the same old thing, but then hate on any movie that tries to do something unique as well. I enjoyed 'The Turning' and would recommend it.",

            "content": "I buy a lot of movies. Many of them I buy \"blind\" having no experience with the film or real knowledge of it. Tuesday just comes around and brings new things and I can't help myself. Well, worth COVID effectively halting that I've been going back and picking up ones I missed. I can honestly say that I have been blown away by how good some of these are and disappointed with a fair amount as well. I just take that as the risk, the gamble in buying blind.All that to say that not one time have I bought a movie, watched it and then immediately wanted both my time and my money back, until The Turning. What a wretchedly awful experience this was. So let's just rip this band aid off and get into it.This movie has no real plot. No real narrative structure. No character development or growth. No context for the who, what, where, why or how. Things are introduced once as though they're important and then never mentioned again FREQUENTLY. The acting is underwhelming. The atmosphere is there but not strong enough because they never take the time to establish ANYTHING so I don't care about ANYTHING.Now, it's only about an hour and a half long, so you might think that's good. Problem is it feels like it takes forever. I was halfway through this and still waiting for the movie to movie at all. The cherry on top is the (no spoilers) atrocious non-ending that explains nothing and feels like they just suddenly ran out of film and decided to call it quits. Only for the credits to feature this nonsense of a hand on a wall that reminds us this was directed by someone that primarily makes music videos and suddenly things make sense. In music videos you don't need a plot or a story or anything to make any sense at all, I just wish someone at some point in this things production would have nudged her and said, \"Hey, you know this is supposed to be a movie, right? We don't start the Taylor Swift video until NEXT week.\" Seriously, why was there nobody on set for this asking what in the world was happening?Also, maybe this is more a personal peeve, but this is another horror movie trying to use mental illness as an easy button and it seriously annoys me. Just because someone has mental illness in there family does NOT mean they are going to go crazy and kill people and this rhetoric that horror movies push is offensive and insensitive to those struggling with their own mental health and the anxiety of what others will think if it's found out. It's 2020 now, let's try a different angle.The not quite so bad is that if you're unfortunate enough to have wasted money on the blu-ray, like this dummy did, you may be treated to a few deleted scenes and an alternate ending. These do help flesh things out a bit, giving more context and clarity as to what's happening but are still a pretty muddled mess that point to a lack of oversight and cohesion on set and behind the camera. To be clear, these added scenes do NOT make this thing good or the blu-ray worth buying.As for the good... Uh... It looks pretty sometimes? There's an attempt at atmosphere here but again, with no context for ANYTHING it doesn't matter how spooky a shot is because I. Don't. Care. Not about a single thing happening.Final thoughts? This is absolute garbage. I'd like the 96+ minutes of my life back, along with the $25 I wasted and a letter of apology from everyone involved. This is absolutely one of the worst things I've seen in a long time and I will actively discourage anyone and everyone from seeing it.Ugh.",

            "content": "I gave this movie three stars for the acting, the superbly creepy children, and for a couple good scares. I couldn't think of anything to merit a fourth star.Here's a detailed summary so you don't have to watch it. Kate becomes a governess/tutor to an orphaned girl named Flora. Unbeknownst to Kate, Flora's brother, Miles, is expelled from boarding school and returns home. So now she has two kids in her charge. The only other person in the house to help is Mrs. Grose. I take it she manages the estate and everything that entails. Plus she Mile's and Flora's guardian.Miles and Kate immediately get off on the wrong foot. These are privileged children and Miles doesn't like to be bossed around. He is extremely creepy and hateful to Kate. At times his mannerisms and behavior seem like a sociopath. Kate is definitely scared of him.And while dealing with that, Kate starts to hear voices at night. Then she starts seeing fleeting spirits, quick enough that she's unsure if they were real. Pretty soon though, the spirits begin to make themselves more seen and even attack her. She eventually sees that the female spirit (Jessel) is of the last governess and the male spirit is of the deceased horse manager (Quint). The movie continues with Jessel trying to show Kate different things that happened to her. And Quint keeps trying to scare and hurt Kate. Sometimes it seems he even inhabits the body of Miles to intimidate her even more.Eventually it got to a point where I thought the ending was actually going to be good. Kate received black paintings from her mom, who was in an insane asylum. That night, Through physical visions, Kate sees Quint r*pe and kill Jessel. This is after Jessel's spirit pulls her into one of the house ponds, where Quint apparently placed her body. After seeing this, Quint also attacks Kate and then pushes Mrs. Grose over the staircase railing. Kate frantically finds the children and convinces them to leave with her. As they are exiting the property, the movie goes back to when Kate first started looking at her mom's paintings. So none of this paragraph actually happened to Kate, Mrs. Grose, or the kids. There are a few paintings though, so I thought perhaps each one would be a different ending. How cool would that have been? Four different endings. Instead, we get NO REAL ENDING.Kate is made out to be crazy. The kids are still extra creepy, with Flora being afraid of Kate too. And I still don't know if there were any spirits. Plus, was the woman in the asylum supposed to be Kate at the end? Was EVERYTHING just a story in her own mind?Did Kate inherit her mother's psychological disorder, which caused her to imagine things? Or was evil really in the house and it caused her to go crazy? If it was the latter, why the heck didn't she leave? The behavior of the elder brother Miles would've been enough for me to go. But Kate stuck it out to try and \"reach\" him. Blah. After she saw evil spirits and these entities actually attacked her, she should've fled that house. This movie left me with more questions than answers.",

            "content": "Harnessing a large majority of talent, potential, and an interesting setting- The Turning unfortunately has no clear idea on how to handle its own material, and no idea how to manage its own story. I will stop and say, that even though the script of the film is very messy and confusing, I did feel the actors did their best with the material provided. Mackenzie Davis provided a good performance for the lead, even though her character was oddly mysterious and vague for no apparent reason. Finn Wolfhard, Brooklynn Prince, and Barbara Marten also give the best they can to their performances, but unfortunately they fall more victim to the script than they deserved. The film, simply stated, is a mess. It has no clue which direction it wants to take, and instead provides a vague sense of plot, story, and elements, to get by as a film at all. It's often predictable with its scares, full of various cliches, and its writing is often nonsensical and incredibly random, even impulsive. It does have a very interesting premise, and can be interesting to follow at times, but eventually the struggle to watch the film and comprehend it seems far from worth it, and I can definitely see why so many people gave up watching this film, let alone making it into anything worth watching. The editing is horrendous in this film, and possibly why the reason it suffers most. It's ending, as noted by anyone that has seen this film and written a review on it, is quite vague and honestly pretty terrible. It feels lazy, forced, and honestly doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I can see that they struggled with this film, and I almost feel bad for the production team making it, but it is no excuse for the sloppy mess that it ended up turning into (no pun intended). I do adore the look of the film, and some of the atmosphere, but ultimately a compelling setting does not make a compelling film, and it was dissapointing to see the film unfold into such a case. In the end, The Turning is not a total waste of time, but a large waste of talent and opportunity. Here's hoping that Mike Flanagan's series adaptation later this year will do the story justice.\nMy Rating: 4.5/10",

            "content": "The low ratings of the movie probably stem from its ambiguity. It actually illustrates how Kate descends into madness; hence the title. This is alluded to in the beginning when the eye of an older woman reliving the attack of the previous nanny is cut into the eye of Kate, portrayed by Mackenzie Davis, suggesting that they are the same person. The flashback opens with Kurt Cobain's suicide, which occurred in 1994, chronicling young Kate. The scene depicting Kate escaping with the children is imagined, and what truly occurred was the scene shown in the succeeding flashback where the children note that Kate is crazy when she asks them if they've seen ghosts. In the last scene, Kate is horrified when she realizes that it is she who is being held in the asylum, and not her mother. When paused, the figure Kate is frightened by in the pool is simply the woman portrayed by Joely Richardson, her older self in present day. This explains the drawings on the pool wall, of Kate recollecting her horrible experience at the mansion.\nIt is an intriguing psychological, rather than a horror, movie with a twist, worth the watch.",

A modern take on Henry James' novella \"The Turn of the Screw\"This film was panned by critics severely..... I however found a lot of promise here,despite the convoluted W.T.F. ending. I enjoyed \"The Turning\". The Turning isn't a complete disaster. The cinematography is really well done, there's some nice camera work here and the long, drawn out scenes with the kids to open the film does add an unsettling air of uneasiness to a lot of the artsy imagery. It's helped further by the musical score too which is fantastic, doing a wonderful job of building up to scares. One rather important beef, \u00b7 bellyache, complain, \u00b7 crab, \u00b7 croak, \u00b7 gripe, \u00b7 grouse, ...Sigismondi's version relies heavily on lazy jump scares, they are somewhat effective but this film could have risen to \"rarefied air\" if Sigismondi had chosen to communicate the fright visually with a Classically surreal style of psychological horror akin to 1961 The Innocents to deliver fright sequences . I also must be clear the film had such moody, stylish slice of old-fashioned Gothic atmospheric cinematography that ultimately it delivers.cinematographer David Ungaro creates a terrific atmosphere in and around the stately house. From the chilly but livable grounds, there's a beautiful hedge maze that seems easy to get lost in, a stable of horses, and a koi pond . Inside, there's an indoor arboretum with headless dolls in a bird bath; a creepy sewing room, made creepier with a human-sized mannequin of an old maid; and hidden hallways. The set design is lavish, dripping ambiance and production value.The acting is first rate .Mackenzie Davis (Tully 2018) sells her performance with warmth and backbone. Davis is quite good, conveying Kate's descent into madness as her restless, nightmare-laden nights worsen and her entire demeanor gradually changes over the course of the film. She might be overwhelmed and seeing things that aren't there, but no matter the real answer, her disorienting confusion is shared by the viewer. Brooklyn Prince (2017's \"The Florida Project\") and Finn Wolfhard (2017's \"It\") are both unnerving in their own way, the former playing Flora as a playful innocent and the latter playing Miles as a disturbed adolescent, and Barbara Marten is quietly chilling as the cold Mrs. Grose.The ending of the film . A little bit of ambiguity that leaves the audience to interpret the rest can be a pitch-perfect way to end a film. In the case of \"The Turning,\" it doesn't end so much as stop with an abrupt shrug. Does a film live or die on an unsatisfying wrap-up, rendering everything that's good about it all for naught? To me absolutely not. \"The Turning\" proves that there can still be enough to like for most of its run time. See \"The Turning\" For its Art House sensibilities , it's excellent Acting and Cinematography. 7/10Director: Floria Sigismondi Writers: Carey W.

            "content": "With the deliciously creepy (and somewhat... sensual?) trailer, \"The Turning\" was a movie I was very excited to see. And then the reviews came out. I mean, 3.7 on IMDb? Say it ain't so. But even with the less than stellar reviews, I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. Mackenzie Davis and Finn Wolfhard would never steer me wrong, right?With a visually stunning first 15 minutes, \"The Turning\" devolves into a plot-less, plodding, bore fest of a film. Look, I really wanted to love this movie, but it's hard to love a movie where almost nothing happens, and when things do happen, you're not invested enough to care. Where do I even start? That's not a metaphorical question, that's literal because I'm stone cold sober right now and I'm having an incredibly hard time thinking creatively enough to write this review. I guess that's the price I have to pay for sobriety. We'll see how long that lasts!The movie begins with our lovely, blonde, gorgeous protagonist Kate, played by Mackenzie Davis, leaving her job as a teacher to become a governess for the seven year old Flora Fairchild after Miss Jessel's (Flora's previous live-in tutor) disappearance (I got that straight from Wikipedia!). And when the movie begins, there are some shimmers of hope. Aside from the opening scene of the film, the beginning overall isn't too bad. It's directed and shot well, and the composition and cinematography is pretty to look at. Sure, the dialogue wasn't the best, but I was excited to get to the house and see where the story went and Finn Wolfhard at work.When the actual story kicks in and when our lovely protagonist gets to the house, the \"plot\" no longer exists. The movie turns into a compilation of scenes where Kate interacts with the children, sees or hears something weird in the house, goes to bed, has a nightmare, and then rinse and repeat. It's not engaging, it's not interesting, and perhaps most irritatingly, Kate is mean to Finn Wolfhard's character fright from the beginning for no reason. I mean, at one point he's bouncing a tennis ball of a wall over and over while Kate is trying to teach Flora, played by Brooklynn Prince, and instead of quietly and politely asking Finn to knock it off, she runs up to him and screams, \"Stop it!\" What? Where did that come from?I guess since I'm talking about the characters of this movie, I might as well talk about the best ones in the film, which are Kate and Miles, aka, Brooklynn Prince and Finn Wolfhard. They were super fantastic in this movie (not that Mackenzie Davis wasn't-she was fine with what she had, I just want to give special attention to Brooklyn and Finn). Finn gave a surprisingly sympathetic performance, much more nuanced than the trailer portrayed him to be. Less of a sociopath and more of a damaged, and potentially abused, boy crying for help through his actions, Finn is no doubt a versatile young actor. But if Finn was good, Brooklynn was great. I mean, wow. I didn't expect her to be the best actor in this entire film. She was smart and sassy, and honestly just a blast to watch on screen. I can't wait to see what else she does and I honestly cannot emphasize enough how fantastic she was in this.So on one hand the acting is good, but the editing, the plot, and especially the way the movie ends are all just so disappointing. I didn't hate the ending like a lot of other reviewers seem to be hating it, I just found, well, disappointing. The movie just sort of ends, after first rewinding, for lack of a better word, which makes the 20 minutes before that absolutely worthless and moot. And the bad part is, those 20 minutes were actually pretty good, so I don't know what exactly the studio, producers, and director were all thinking. The ending we get has no finality and is a non-ending on purpose, leaving it up to our imagination, but instead of being thought-provoking, it comes across as lazy. It's obvious they had multiple endings filmed and didn't know which one to use, so what the hell, they just used all of them.I'd recommend this movie strictly for the performances of the actors, specifically Brooklyn and Finn. Other than that, unless you really have nothing else to do, there are far better ways to spend your time.2/10",

            "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I... am... in shock. The Turning had tons of development issues, switching directors (Juan Carlos Fresnadillo was the first choice), cast, producers (Steven Spielberg was once responsible for the project), and who knows what else. It's yet another adaptation of the famous ghost story, Turn of the Screw by Henry James, so it was always going to be a challenging task to bring a horror flick with something unique that the others didn't possess. After so many changes, the film finally decided on Mackenzie Davis as the adult protagonist, and Finn Wolfhard and Brooklynn Prince as the young kids.They replaced everything and everyone, except the people who are behind the main reason why this movie fails so miserably: the screenwriters. With all due respect to the Hayes brothers, but this is the worst kind of a bad film. It doesn't have a single redeemable quality about it. It's a movie about... nothing! It has no message, no purpose, no structure, and last but not least: there's no ending. I'm not joking, The Turning doesn't have an ending. It's like someone abruptly shouts \"roll credits\" way before any sort of payoff is delivered.The whole film is a collection of repetitive, dull scenes that only vary in location. Scareless and predictable jump scare sequences spread throughout the entire runtime with no meaning or objective underneath. Close to ninety minutes of build-up to utterly nothing. This isn't one of those cases where the ending is just ambiguous, and people can interpret it in several ways. As baffling as it might sound, this monotonous, cliche, boring horror movie doesn't possess an ending. I have to repeat it, so you actually believe what I'm writing.Even if I simply ignore that last (nonexistent) act, the rest of the film is still awful. As the viewer, knowing more than the main character about what's happening or what's about to unravel is almost always a lousy aspect concerning the horror genre. Not only there's a lack of a scary or eerie environment, but the narrative raises dozens of logical questions that eventually get no answer. The movie actually starts reasonably okay, it got me slightly invested in Davis' character, but it quickly becomes one of the most yawning-inducing experiences I've had this year.Usually, I can turn to the acting to help me get through the hardest portions of the film. However, Mackenzie Davis (who I liked a lot in Terminator: Dark Fate) gradually starts to become uninteresting, and Finn Wolfhard delivers the worst performance I've ever seen from him. Brooklynn Prince is good for her age, but she's still a 9-year-old kid, so... you know. Barbara Marten is probably the best as Mrs. Grose, but just like the movie itself, she has no real impact on anything. Technically, the score is weird, and instead of elevating the scary sequences, it turns them into a rock concert. The editing also lacks consistency.Honestly, I thought that Fantasy Island was a safe bet for the \"Worst Movie of 2020\" prize, but The Turning just entered the race. As logically absurd as the former might be, at least it has an ending. It's a ridiculous one, but it's, in fact, an ending. The latter not only lacks a payoff to the ninety minutes of build-up, but it has absolutely no redeeming quality. Describing a film in a one-word sentence was never this easy: \"nothing\". It's a movie about nothing! No meaning, no message, no purpose, no logical sense. An extremely boring journey through a mansion with predictable jump scares, an awkward score, and disappointing acting. It's an emotionless story packed with unanswered questions, and no, it's not one of those \"ambiguous narrative\" cases. I definitely don't recommend it, unless you desire that frustration of watching an incomplete film.Rating: F",

But it's called a mystery for a reason and unless you're blind the clues are sprinkled throughout. You just need to look for them.Work back from the point where Kate opens the envelope from her mother. In the scene where Kate is packing she picks up a stack of papers topped by an envelope suspiciously like the one she opens later. Why is her friend, Rose, asking her if she's taking them? Why is she worried about her even though Kate is going from a classroom of children to only one? Every time Kate calls her the first words out of Rose's mouth are \"Are you OK?\". The signs are already there. It's a mystery remember?Then she visits her mother who is concerned about the responsibility Kate is taking on. Darla gives her a portrait, a colorful painting of her daughter quite unlike the featureless, black sheets in the envelope Kate opens at the estate and which send her into a tailspin. Isn't this the same envelope Kate packs? Listen to the song playing in Kate's headphones as she's walking through the asylum. It's called \"I Don't Know\". Its chorus is \"Is it all in my head, Is it all in your mind, I don't know\".Enough said. There's more clues sprinkled throughout, too many to list but if you watch it again the ending becomes obvious. I think most people concentrated on the \"horror\" part and ignored the \"mystery\" part. I think the emphasis is on the latter and that's where this film is brilliant.",

The Innocents (1961) and The Turn of the Screw (1992) were great British versions. The 1985 Spanish version was good with a controversy script about male homosexuality around this ghost story, meanwhile the 2006 American version was a decent version using a lesbian theme. Now this 2020 version, a co-production between The United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada and The United States is a very weak film. The gothic atmosphere is perfect like Henry James described it in his novel. The cinematography is cool and creepy, the locations are wonderful and the cast is great too. Davis is so lovely playing Kate. Even the film is a decent adaptation but something went missing almost the last minutes. The horror or psychological horror is a second element because the film works as a drama. The soundtrack is terrific, specially at the end credits. Could be a better film.",

It has descent actors but there aren't any real moments of horror to be found. It's based on an 1898 novella by Henry James called 'The Turn of the Screw' and there have been several movie adaptations, too. Mackenzie is hired by Barbara to take care of Finn & Brooklynn-their parents died in a car accident. The previous nanny left under mysterious circumstances and the grounds keeper seems to have disappeared, too. Weird things start happening, mostly Mackenzie seeing things and then waking up from a dream. The kids act a little weird. There are scenes that seem to be out of order and don't make any sense and the ending is just way out there-other people in the theater, including me, were saying, 'What the heck just happened?'\nIt's rated \"PG-13\" for terror, violence, disturbing images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 34 minutes.\nI would not buy this on DVD. I wouldn't rent it, either. If you really want to watch it-and for the love of me, I don't know why-I would wait until it comes to cable.",

It's one of those supernatural horror movies that delivers the same similar premises. Governess played by Mackenzie Davis goes to an estate. To accompany a little girl there. And her older brother. The older brother is rude and creepy. While, there is some ghostly figure that she is trying to discover. Or unless it's her own delusions.The concept is boring. Seeing a character wonder an old house. With something lurking in the shadows or reflections in the mirrors. Almost similar to the woman in black movie. But this films story is just terrible. Mackenzie Davis character mother suffers from a condition which not much is discussed with the movie. Besides, she is questioning her reality if it's real or all in her head. The ending is one of the worst endings ever which there is a twist. But a twist that lacks logic and it does not make any sense. May confuse the audience than deliver a spine chilling ending.The script and direction is horrible. It's a slow moving script. With boring characters. Mackenzie Davis is the only best thing in the movie. But even her character is dull. The acting is tedious. The direction tries for a lot of jump scares but fails at it. Cause it foreshadows for the predictable scares.Overall, The Turning is one of the worst films ever. Boring acting. Boring direction. Dumb story.

MacKenzie Davis is good as the new governess Kate and it's not really her fault that the script makes her ignore all of the warnings. Even a Terminator would have difficulties with the children, Brooklynn Prince as Flora cuts the heads off dolls and takes advice from a special doll; Finn Wolfhard is Miles, a truculent teen, he likes spiders and knows what Kate dreams about and has a friend who lives in a mirror. Barbara Marten is the creepy housekeeper, Mrs Grose. The house itself is rambling but less so than the screenplay.

I wonder what was going through the filmmakers mind when drafting that ending. I won't say what happened but I must say that ending alone brings the films rating and quality down by a lot. What you get with The Turning is atmospheric nothingness for a full 90 minutes. Only saving grace, are the performances from its actors.\nThe film is about a woman who becomes a governess for a child who lives at an estate. Once there she realizes that the girls disturbed older brother is also back from boarding school. Soon she starts realizing that the children are not what they seem and that there is a ghostly presence in the house related to the wicked former horse riding instructor who stayed at the house. The woman is curious to find out more about all this while protecting the young girl she is tasked to serve.The best part of the film is definitely the acting of Mackenzie Davis and especially Brooklynn Prince. Prince was tremendous in The Florida Project and she brought a lively energy to this film, and it was needed. Finn Wolfhard is plain annoying in this film and is now in that annoying teenager phase of life. The film opens with the announcement of the death of Kurt Cobain because? The film falls for the usual horror trope pitfalls that plague films today. Jump scares that are so predictable and just not scary. A plot that brings up different issues vaguely but fails to focus on any of it. Above all, the worst offender is the ending.\nThe ending was heading in a decent direction before doing a fake out that made absolutely no sense. I could hear the theater become perplexed. After that, guess what? Another twist! Not only that but then it fades to black extremely abruptly. I don't know how they came to this conclusion or what the artistic merit to it might have been but it was resoundingly awful. A mediocre horror film at best made infinitely worst by its ridiculously stupid ending.\n4/10",

Mackenzie Davis is ok, she overacts a bit, but she was fine. The young girl was also decent. Finn Wolfhard was at times fine, but also at times very bad. But that's all I have really to say about the positives. The movies scares are all surface level. Just dull jump scares, dream sequences, and things in the corner of your eye. The movie barley has any real value of dread or tension. Whenever something that could be scary happens it's end up being a dream. The ending too is was also very bad.The final 10 minutes has Kate get the kids out of the house after the ghost attacks Mrs. Grose by pushing her off the stairs. Then they escape, and it turns out the whole thing was just in Kates mind. So none of that happened. And then she has a vision of her mom, and her mom looks at her, and Kate screams. That's the end.Overall \"The Turning\" has good cinematography, and some decent acting, but the scares are dull, it's cliched, nothing really happens, and the ending is absolutely terrible.",

It's an absolute bore, an uninspired mess of a film with an ending that leaves more questions than answers. And, in an effort to boost home video sales, they offer alternate endings, none of which offer any kind of sufficient closure for the viewer.\n2001: A Space Odyssey is justified in its complexity and confusion, even after multiple viewings. But this is nothing more than a low-grade horror movie that desperately wants to be a Kubrickian masterpiece but doesn't have the balls to rise to the challenge. And so, it flounders around for an hour and a half while you watch it, scratching your head and wondering why you don't abandon ship for something actually worthy of your time.

The ending isn't very clear and the rest of the movie doesn't make it very easy to interpret. The problem is that the ending tries to be more intelligent than the actual movie. The movie itself plays out pretty straight without beefing up the story very much.If I had to guess, I'd say they have tried to compromise between making a generic scary movie and more of a drama movie and ended up with a mess. It felt like some scenes have been made scarier in post just to speed things up, like quite early in the movie when the new teacher goes to the horse stable to look for the girl, it's made really creepy with music etc even tho there shouldn't be any reason to be scared at that point. There are also scenes that make no sense nor are explained (the east wing, mannequins..) and whatever the relationship was between the boy and the riding teacher was left really vague, leaving the boys actions a mystery. Actually there really is no proper story told here, just randomish events leading to randomish end.The movie was surprisingly fun to watch tho, but ultimately not very rewarding. Had they built up the ending with better care and focus it would have been a real winner. My guess is that this is not the directors vision nor cut, but rather producers wanting a more crowd pleasing cut, ultimately failing at it. But that's just a guess.Acting and cinematography are great, the girl is quite funny as she's much more naturally \"kid\" than kids often are in horror movies, like she was just being herself and not acting at all. At first it felt a bit off, but there are enough horror movies with serious kids acting like grown ups. The girl as a character is surprisingly meaningless tho, now that I think about it.",

            "content": "This movie reminds me of High School when I had an essay to write and \"forgot\" to do it in advance. Then, while on the bus on the day the essay was due, I scribbled some nonsense on paper and handed it in to the teacher. I knew I was going to get a D- for the essay, but that's better than an F.......right? RIGHT???First, I hated EVERY character in this movie (with the exception of the roommate \"Rose.\" Probably because she was only in the movie for three minutes or so).How did Mackenzie Davis' character (\"Kate\") teach a classroom of kids prior to becoming a Nanny? She was a human doormat for the two main kids in the house. The old lady (\"Mrs. Grose\"?) even tells Kate that she needs to take charge. At that point I thought Kate would start to be an adult, but nooooooo.Also, was Mackenzie wearing a wig pulled out of a bargain bin at the local Goodwill store? Normally, I don't concern myself with such things, but her hair was a distraction.Even though Mrs. Grose wanted Kate to exude more authority, she chastised Kate every time she raised her voice to the kids. Mainly, I disliked Mrs. Grose because she was a grumpy and annoying old lady. I guess that was the point.Even though the little girl (\"Flora\") was somewhat endearing, both kids were spoiled brats.The boy was portrayed as a psychopath and should have been in a home for juvenile delinquents rather than a boarding school. And how was he able to leave the estate property to go to boarding school in the first place?The story moved all over the place. Sometimes in circles. Sometime into a dead end.What was the obscure reference to Kurt Cobain's death, except to tell anyone who cares (or remembers) that Cobain killed himself in 1994. The timeframe for the movie seemed irrelevant to the plot. Granted, cell phones and other technology wasn't nearly as widespread then as it is now. However, given the fact that Kate was determined to stay (because she made a \"cross her heart and hope to die\" promise to Flora), it's doubtful that Kate was going to use any sort of technology to help her out of her mess...no matter what! For what it was worth, the movie could have been set is 1894 or 2094 and not changed the rambling plot.The ending (or lack of an ending) was an F.U. middle finger to the audience. I've heard some wild theories about the ending in an attempt to justify it, but the people who ultimately allowed this version of this movie to be shown in theaters should be looking for another career.If the movie ran out of money, I could almost (ALMOST) accept that answer.If there are better endings that will be released on DVD/Blu-Ray, then that's two middle fingers, a kick in the butt and a giant F.U. through a megaphone to anyone who slogged through this mess in the theater.If everything was a dream or the fantasy of a crazy person, then...(see my previous point).When the credits started rolling, I audibly said \"What???\" Other movie goers expressed a collective groan.The set/location was impressive, but that's about it.This movie had potential, but a group of incompetent people dropped the ball at the one yard line and lost the game for the home team. Uggggh!",

When this movie actually took a second to breathe the cinematography really shinned through. Another redeeming quality of the film is Brooklyn Prince as the little girl (whatever her name was). She gave easily the best performance in the movie and stole the show in most of her scenes.Now the rest of the movie... well it was a pretty terrible. The first 2 acts of the film is just filled with cheap unearned jump scare scenes one after another and really starts to wear you out. None of the scares really landed and as I said they were rushed and unearned.And the ending, oh boy the ending. I'm not going to spoil it, but it was bad. Very bad it didn't make any sense and it left me feeling empty after the film.There is much more I could go into but that would dive into spoilers so I'll just leave it at that.

Unfortunately, the extreme level of ambiguity is not an audience pleaser.\nThe story would have been better served if the conclusion offered more subtle feelings of unease or doubt.Half the theater was talking after the credits trying to figure out what had happened in the last 20 minutes.It was entertaining enough to watch, but The Turning is a middling horror movie.6/10",

The biggest complaint is the ending but I can tell you the book doesn't end any less abruptly so they didn't have a lot to go off of. If anything they gave you more information and plot in the movie. If you want to know the book ending, though, I can tell you Flora goes to live with her uncle shortly after the confrontation the movie ends on, Miles dies, and the governess takes a different job. People are complaining about how vague it was since you don't know if the ghosts are real or not but that is the entire point of the movie and book. Not knowing if you're going insane or not is almost scarier than the ghosts. The only thing that could've saved this movie based on a confusing and vague book is having a linear time line and not doing the \"and the last half hour is all in her head\" and left it at that. I think the movie worked with what it had, the acting was good, and Miles' character was well written because you didn't know whether to like him or not. I'm not going to see it again but I don't think it was a waste of my time.",

I have no idea what happened and why she screamed. I have no idea whether she was actually seeing ghosts or if she was going crazy like her mom. When I saw the credits roll, I was literally like \"wait, that's IT?\"Onto the positives, I really liked the clothing used for this film. It really gives a nice 90's feel. The aesthetic of the film was also very beautiful and almost ethereal in a way.Also, I wanted to talk about how fantastic Finn Wolfhard was. His acting was the highlight of this movie for me. He is already so talented at such a young age, I can really see him becoming one of the Hollywood legends who are hired in every film when he grows up. This was my first time seeing him in a role where he played an antagonistic, sociopathic character and he absolutely blew me away with how great he was. He has such an amazing range and I'm really excited to see more of him in the future. Hopefully he goes on to film movies that have a much better script.Overall, I would not recommend anyone see this movie unless you're seeing it for free or you don't mind movies that have confusing endings. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 instead of a lower rating is because Finn Wolfhard really impressed me with his incredible acting ability.",

The book and original movie (the innocence) do very well at not making it clear if the nanny has gone mad or if the house/children are possessed. The Turning removes that wonderment at the end, but does so in a way that you become disappointed with the result instead of wanting more. So, not a bad film and it certainly deserves a higher rating, but if you were to compare it to its predecessors, it will likely be ranked the poorest.",

            "content": "I read Henry James' The Turning of the Screw as a teenager, with the young governess not knowing if she is fighting the supernatural, or whether it is all in her own head. Floria Sigismondi's new version The Turning takes us further down the rabbit hole of mental health, with Mackenzie Davis as the 90's hip governess. We begin with the death of Kurt Cobain on the radio!, and a plum job looking after a little poppet in a big old gothic style house. The poster below gives us a hint of horror and Joely Richardson as the mother in a psychiatric hospital spins the mental health theme.Miss Mandell isn't the first governess to the 'thoroughbred' children though; as housekeeper and all round scary Barbara Marten's Ms Grose, tells Kate. And sadly for little Flora, Miss Jessel left without saying goodbye. But did she ever leave? We know from the opening that something happened to Miss Jessel, but Floria Sigismondi, just like Henry James himself, is not going to make it easy for us to figure it out. And as Kate promises not to leave Flora we know she is here for the long haul. And loving it. Although the life-size mannequin of Flora's great grandmother in Kate's room has a life of her own, and is hurriedly banished to the sewing room which seems to enjoy the new resident. And strange disturbing images keep appearing in the window and mirrors for our jump scare enjoyment. Plus Kate found Miss Jessel's diary which describes dark things going on with the former riding instructor. Things that unsurprisingly Kate is now starting to dream about. And hear the ghostly cries. I loved the mournful cello music but a bit bizarre mixing with the modern Grunge. Kurt's influence on Nathan Barr I guess.When older brother Miles unexpectedly returns from boarding school (after being expelled), Brooklynn Prince's Flora is thrilled to have her big brother home, for Ms Grose Miles can do no wrong. But Kate is wary of the privileged boy played by the talented Finn Wolfhard, in the typically left of centre character. And Miles does have a mean streak. The Peter Quint character of the original novel has been replaced with the riding instructor who recently died, not particularly scary we think. But he has his moments in said windows and mirrors. And maybe those are his hands in the poster. With Miles apparently having picked up some of his unappealing habits. Or has he?, boys like spiders. But whipping a horse so gleefully when he teaches Kate to ride? That doesn't seem normal.This to me is Kate's time to leave and her former roommate suggests she should too, let's say any sane person might. But she still refuses to leave Flora as she understands the little girl's trauma of being left alone. A trip to get ice cream ends in disaster as Flora seems unable to leave the grounds. Maybe PTSD associated with her parent's death just outside the gates.But it is after a ghostly meeting in a supposed drowning joke by the children, that Kate really starts to fall apart, and starts putting the light on when she goes to sleep. Ms Grose hopes that Kate's mother's 'condition' doesn't run in the family, when her mother sends her bizarre artwork. Ouch. Does Ms Grose not notice the once bouncy Kate is now an unravelling shadow of herself. This is the turning point for me in the film.A note to future Nannies, don't play hide and seek by torch in the forbidden wing of the creepy house. Or else don't be surprised when things go bump in the dark.The film poses several points of view but settles on none. We discover that Miles's friend thinks Kate's tattoo is sexy, and wonder is Miles just being himself or being controlled by Quint? The age old question that Henry James posed. In all honesty I found Miles a stroppy teenager, with the adolescent boy fancies the nanny etc. But a subsequent sequence could explain the hauntings and what Ms Grose's involvement in the story was, until it is ripped away from us and we are just left to wonder if it was all in Kate's disturbed imagination. Or were those artworks a black view of Kate's reality and future. Floria invites us to wonder when, or if, psychosis becomes haunting. And is psychosis just a view into the paranormal that maybe only those with second sight, and children, can see. I like to think so as it would give Joely Richardson a bigger role in the film.But maddeningly Floria is not letting us know either way. Even as we wallow in the swimming pool of what just happened and how did we get here. Paki Smith created some interesting production design and David Ungaro took advantage of the haunted house and mist filled estate with the cinematography. But it still needs more horror along with the psychological.",

It's a sloppy film filled with an abundance of cheap scares and odd dream sequences but it's also very engaging and has a very creeptastic atmosphere. Kate (Davis) is a hard character to root for. It becomes increasingly obvious that something is going on but she never leaves. And yes I get that her staying is tied to her experience and the way she was raised but it's just a little too hard to believe. Most people will have a big problem with the ending and I totally get it. It ends very bluntly and to me it feels intentional and open ended but at the same time its unsatisfactory. It left me wanting to see it again to see if I missed stuff that led up to it or it just wasn't successful in communicating what the film was trying to say. Like I said most people are gonna hate it and I totally get that. It felt like most of the film was pretty straight forward until it wasn't. But I dont know I found myself engaged, intrigued and entertained but that's just me and I like weird stuff.",

This is easily the worst major movie so far in 2020. It's really boring and lame. The jumpscares aren't scary and the it never commits fully to the physiological stuff so it doesn't work as a physiological thriller either. It's basically if you took the 30 minute beginning of a horror movie but just made that the whole movie. Nothing happens, we don't move the story along until the very end and when that happens we get quite possibly the worst movie ending in a while. The ending somehow made an awful movie even worse. The only things that I can recommend is Brooklynn Princes amazing performance, she's so talented and plays her part very well, and some of the gothic imagery looking very pretty. It's an awful movie.

            "content": "My 11 year old daughter and I went to see this last night. She begged me to take her because she loves Finn Wolfgard. It's PG-13 so I figured it wouldn't be that bad. However, the reviews made me think I was going to be sitting through a terrible movie.However, I was wrong!! The cinematography and direction on this film was amazing. The performances were spot on. Everything was shot in a way to keep you guessing the whole time. It ends abruptly and my daughter and I were confused at first.On the way home, we started debating what actually happened. We decided that the governess was daydreaming for part of the film where they escape. She was wishing that she would get the children off the property, that Miles would finally agree with her, and Flora would be brave enough to go through the gates. Kate would escape the evil on the property that had been haunting her. And Miles ends up being an okay kid who is just scared.This isn't reality though. She comes back to reality looking at her moms drawings. She's questioning her sanity at this point. Is the paranormal real or is she just losing her mind like her mother? The director leaves us to make our own conclusions. My daughter and I think she really was haunted and was being slowly driven crazy by the house. Some kind of irony. But, that's just what we think. Draw your own conclusions!When I got home, I read about The Turn of the Screw, which was written by Henry James in 1898. James never landed on one side either. He left his readers to draw their own conclusions about the sanity of the governess. So the director stayed true to the original work.Overall, I think it was a great movie. If you like movies that have a sweet, tied up ending for you, this probably isn't your movie. I think that's probably where the bad reviews are coming from. People didn't get an ending they wanted. If you like creepy movies that make you think, you'll love it!!",

The characters came to be totally unlikeable. Finally, the ending is a true disaster.\nI can see a universe in which this ending works, unfortunately is executed in the weirdest, most twisted and shock-seeking way possible.

It kept my interests nothing seemed to be wrong on my viewing, this is just how I felt. Yes the ending was abrupt but it didn't make the film horrible. I feel that so many of the 2020 horror movies released between January-March were badly reviewed. I enjoyed it and that's why I am writing this review.

The script was terrible and felt so forced. Brooklynn Prince was absolutely amazing in The Florida Project, she isn't bad at acting. Finn was great in It(the movie) and is great in Stranger Things. When it comes down to it, they couldn't do anything with that script. This movie did both of them so dirty. Don't waste your time watching this movie.

Definitely something I could play in the background or get lost in this gothic fantasy world of large mansions, horseback riding and maze grounds.Because I will give credit, that this is a beautifully shot movie with very gorgeous gothic imagery despite the forced jump scares. Floria Sigismondi and her team did create a beautiful \"world\" with the set production + cinematography.All the actors were excellent and did their best to elevate the material they were given. Mackenzie Davis, Finn Wolfhard and Brooklynn Prince all played off each other very well. Barbara Marten was also fantastic. They carried this movie and deserved better.It's a shame the script wasn't written by someone more skilled and nuanced, because there was so much that could have been explored of the ghosts and the children's suggested trauma. Miles' relationship with Quint and Quint's influence/corruption on Miles. Flora's trauma of not wanting to leave the grounds. So much was set up and teased, but never fully explored.Then there's Kate's trauma of neglect and abandonment issues, possible mental abuse from her mother that's all there in the subtext.The ending though. THAT ENDING. I definitely see why people hate it. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. It makes me think there was an alternate cut and they went with this route, which may have been the \"safe\" route in the studios' mind, but instead, it effectively threw everything out. The original novella hints at a lot of the dark stuff the kids may or may not have witnessed and this movie seemed like it was going in that direction until the last 10 minutes.",

            "content": "The turning\n2020\n15\nDirector: Floria Sigismondi\nStarring: Mackenzie Davis, Finn Wolfhard, Brooklyn Prince, Barbara Marten etc\nOverall rating 61/100\nThe turning focuses on a nanny/tutor Kate Mandell (Mackenzie Davis) who looks after two lonely children in a massive mansion. But they both aren't as sweet as they seem. I thought the turning was pretty decent and fairly fun and had the potential to be great but sadly was let down by severe plot and script issues that sadly bought the films quality down.My first two positives would be its building of tension and well executed Jumpscares. The film did an excellent job at building tension throughout. Making you not know when something was going to jump out at you, therefore I was on the edge of my seat for a large majority of the time. And for the most part the Jumpscares were well executed and came out of nowhere which was great. Yes, there was some generic and predictable ones but for the most part they worked.My next two negatives would be that the film had pretty much no character depth or development and there were just too many lapses in the logic. The film had pretty much no depth to any of the characters they were just there to be creepy or to have a mental breakdown. You couldn't really connect with the characters as you knew nothing about them due to how one dimensional, they were. And sadly, Mackenzie Davis character was just to dumb in places. Whenever there was a creaky door or a slightly open window she went and investigated, lazily setting up for a set of jump scares.My next two positives would be that the film used sound very effectively to create fear or tension. The film used normal day to day sounds and noises but amplified them and played about with them to create a very uncomfortable and jarring effect that worked really well. Whether it was repeatedly bouncing a tennis ball on a door or smashing drums loudly the films sound design was fantastic.My next negative would be the films rushed pacing. The film moved so quickly that they didn't allow anything to settle making the narrative and script very clunky and difficult to follow. It just could of done with being a little bit longer to get fully fleshed out characters and plot points.My next two positives would be the films set locations and uncomfortable tone. The film looked visually fantastic. And they explored the house and its surrounding very well. For some interesting scenes and good areas for well executed Jumpscares. The film really portrayed Finn Wolfhards character well. Making him seem so nice only for him to either be expelled from school or to have a uncomfortable obsession with Mackenzie Davis character was executed perfectly and really got under my skin which I think was the desired effect.My final two positives would be the chemistry between the characters and the great performances. All the actors worked really well together and bounced off each other really well making the characters actions and personalities very believable which made the film more enjoyable to watch. And all of the performances were great especially from Finn Wolfhard and Mackenzie Davis. Mackenzie's slow mental breakdown throughout the film was very believable to see making the audience understand her fear. And Finn for me was the best performance of the film, he perfectly balanced his brotherly bond with his sister but also the uncomfortable obsessive and violent personality of his character.My final two negatives that really bought the film down for me would be its messy and muddled plot and its terrible ending. The film promised a lot of things with its plot, but never really delivered. It just felt as if they had an idea but then didn't think it worked so then they added something completely different. It just made the narrative really clunky and it made the plot very unfocused. And the ending was sadly terrible. I think it was one of the most anticlimactic and confusing endings I have seen. They were going in a good direction, but then they made it so Mackenzie Davis character was imagining most of it and going mad making most of the film pointless and leaving me very disappointed with the end result of the film.Overall despite fantastic performances, interesting sets and visuals and a well balances tone. The turning is sadly ruined by its multiple script and plot issues that makes you leave the film disappointed with the end result despite its potential.",

            "content": "The end.Too much has been written already about the dreadful ending. Many films have used this trope, yes by now it has become a trope, to end a film. In some instances it works; leaves the audience wondering, in a good way, what really happened or will happen. Though mostly the sudden abrupt roll of the credits P.O.'s the crowd, as it does here, in such a \"we ran out of film\" way.Now my other issues...The was set in 1994. No one was established as the legal guardian of the children. Regardless of how wealthy, no one escapes state\\federal child services. Maybe in 1898 when the story was originally set, but certainly not in modern times. For example, Mrs. Grose was not \"the one in charge\" when Myles school called, no, the TUTOR was told to answer the phone! This flew in the face of any sort of real world logic. Kate was hired to tutor Flora, not become both hers and her brothers keeper. Had she, like the novel, been hired to be the nanny (a position somewhere between parent and guardian) then yes she would have some official position over the children. But she was only the tutor.Since both parents were dead and no mention of any paternal or maternal grandparents were made, social services would have indeed stepped in and taken the children. They would have been placed in foster homes where certainly Myles would end up in Juvi or a mental institution and poor Flora would be deemed a hopeless agoraphobic, put on drugs, or also committed like Myles to an institution.Additionally, no indication of who set up the arrangement was given. Some kind of agency had to find Kate and she first would have to have been in their database for such a position. Asking a school teacher from somewhere to go to somewhere for a live in position without vetting via an agency would simply not happen. Every other adaptation I have seen of \"The Turning of the Screw\" covers this in the opening scenes. Plucking someone out of nowhere who has zero experience to boot? Not in 1994.Also as soon as Myles was added to Kate's in house classroom, the original arrangement\\deal was invalid. A new one would need to be worked out before any tutoring began. This did not happen.Kate also was not trapped by her circumstances (as the character was in other adaptations). She had somewhere to go. She could have and should have left when things became unmanageable.IMDB trivia has as post made, no doubt, by the film makers which explains everything as a fantasy as seen through the mind of a committed mental patient. They make it sound so obvious. Too bad they did not work harder to get that successfully across to the audience.",

Personally, the film was interesting enough to keep my attention, but the end result was so confusing, and felt so unfinished.I can definitely give credit to the cast. I was able to feel for the main character Kate (Mackenzie Davis) and the struggles she has to go through thoughtout, although I think the scenes where she's just wandering about get excessive. Miles is my favorite part of the film, Finn Wolfhard does a great job at a more intimidating and chilling role. I also have a feeling young Brooklynn Prince, who plays Flora, has a bright career as an actress ahead of her. Mrs. Grose is played well by Barbara Marten, but her character is really bland, I didn't know what to think of her during the film or after it.As far as the film itself, I'm still wondering nearly 24 hours after watching what it was trying to do. I love that the film takes place in the 90's, and the sets look really nice, but what a strange ride this film goes on. When the credits began to role, a number of people (including myself) threw their hands up at the screen, exclaiming \"what\"? Not only is it difficult to follow, the film isn't very scary. It's more of a Thriller that relies on jump scares to technically make it a \"Horror\". I guess maybe if you have a fear of spiders, you might get a scare, but otherwise, disturbed is about all you'll be.I can also give credit for a couple of scenes involving the gate to the house. I wouldn't call them scary, but definitely intense, and I was able to feel for the characters involved.A few decent things about The Turning, but as a whole, I didn't know where it was going and it ended before I could figure it out. It's like an album with only one or two good songs on it. Kinda disappointing. Perhaps the book has more answers?",

            "content": "The Turning as 'bump in the night' incarnate, is my latest write-up. It is based on the 1898 novella, The Turn of the Screw. \"Turning\" includes Mackenzie Davis in her first starring role. As I watched The Turning, I kept wondering why Mackenzie's character Kate just couldn't find the gumption to get out of the haunted house she was living in. Oh wait, if she left there'd be no movie.Anyway, \"Turning\" is a 2020 release and it is directed by the woman responsible for The Runaways (Floria Sigismondi). Shot almost two years ago in goth fad, I'd say it's the film version of Paranormal Witness crossed with 2001's The Others (if The Others took place in the early 90's).In regards to The Turning, you get countryside Ireland masquerading as Maine for a imitation shooting location. As for the cinematography by David Ungaro, well it's adequately jungly with plenty of low tracking shots and darkness via the Fairchild Estate (I'll get to that later).The performances in \"Turning\" are excellent with Mackenzie Davis, Finn Wolfhard, and Brooklynn Prince being the standouts. Basically, The Turning is loads of horror build-up with atmosphere, moxie, and systematic jump scares in check. Oh and with most fright flicks, the statutory music pounces in at just the right moments.Distributed by Universal Pictures, more morbid than scary, and once a passion project for Steven Spielberg, \"Turning's\" building plot has to do with a nanny who is hired to watch over two orphans at an eerie mansion (the old-world Fairchild Estate).All in all, \"Turning's\" abrupt ending harnessed as stodgy symbolism, is sadly the culprit. It's a head scratch-er and it disappoints almost everything that came before it. Yup, the line producers probably came in and \"turned\" up the heat. Rating: 2 and a half stars.",

In this movie Miles is not a young boy but a rather obnoxious but also somewhat typical youth! And his treatment of Kate is not noticed or accepted by the useless housekeeper Grose and so he gets away with it. The point is the reader, or viewer in this case, has to decide if the ghosts are real or in the governess's imagination.I didn't find this movie boring as I certainly did The Haunting of Bly Manor, which is an overly long adaptation of The Turning of the Screw, which is after all a fairly short work.",

Nonetheless a year later I've gotten around to watching it and I must say that it was a little different than I was expecting. However, if the opportunity arose to see it in theatres, I'd take it.Now that I've watched the movie. I can say that the main selling point for me, surprisingly, were the jump scares. I found them to be on opposite moments from when I was expecting them. What made the jump scares a little bit more spooky, was the music and timing of each scare. Everything was long and drawn out so by the time a jump scare would happen instead of being over it. I got spooked. Overall, I think it the movie was well done with the score, cinematography, and length of the film.One downside, and I don't feel like this is really a spoiler, was the ending. And what do I mean by that? Well, there wasn't one per se. I'm speaking for myself on this one. With the lack of an ending I had to look up what the possible meaning was behind the entire film. Once I did that, everything became more clear and the answers I found made me a little more satisfied with the end result, however, I can't say I'm completely satisfied with the whole concept, but it'll do.Overall:\nMy review is nearly opposite of the reviews I've looked at. I'll leave you with this. If you like puzzles, and perhaps being left a little empty at the end of your movies, you may enjoy this. Jump scares were offset with long, drawn out scenes with an equaling score that made the film fun. Lastly, I didn't feel I wasted my time with this one and therefore if you asked me if you should see it. My answer would be 'yes'.Enjoy the show!",

This movie is better than the IMDB score would lead you to believe.It's a beautifully shot, atmospheric, slow burn Gothic horror story. MacKenzie Davis is great in the role as the governess. She's one of my favorite young actresses. Since the movie is told from her perspective we can't really tell if she's imagining all of the 'haunting' or if it's all in her head. Finn Wolfhard and Brooklyn Prince put in good performances as Miles and Flora.The production value is really high. The private estate they found in Dublin makes a great Bly Manor. There's also some really scary interior sets.The main problem I had with the film is that in an attempt to blaze new ground the writers lost the elements that 'The Innocents' had in blurring the line between what is real and what might be imagined. They also left off some of the most dramatic scenes from the book. As a result the narrative has a certain flatness to it and the ending is non-existent. The movie doesn't have an ending. It just stops. With as many things they had right in this movie there should've been more emphasis on creating a memorable story. For all it's atmosphere the movie ends up falling flat. Still not a bad watch and better than the scores it's getting.",

Based on a Henry James novel, The Turn of the Screw, & previously filmed as 1961's The Innocents starring Deborah Kerr, this is modern update (but whose story screams corsets & horse drawn carriages) which offers nothing that the Insidious/Conjuring crowd will find unpleasantly non-diverting. The actors are at the mercy of the non-story (the plot-line is hijacked by a myriad of scares & boos) & coming from director Floria Sigismondi (she made the interesting The Runaways based on the all girl band from the 70's & directed some Marilyn Manson music videos) the visuals were a given but this smacks of studio interference which left all the story elements stripped away w/nothing but fright moments left behind which is all well in good if this was a movie trailer & not a movie.",

            "content": "Good book and I loved the 60's movie adaptation (The Innocents) so I gave this a cautious try. I actually really liked the ambiguity and the atmosphere and tone of the film. Many 'ghost' / 'am I turning crazy' type movies have exposition that immediately over explains itself and takes away the realism and true ambiguity leaving a tedious exposition of flashbacks and footnotes. This film doesn't make those cliche mistakes of such abundantly tedious flashbacks and such. Instead it only shows the paranoid confusion of what one experiencing this would really feel. This film as a result is luckily much better than it could have been. It stands up next to the other adaptations, and other than the 60s version this is one is one I enjoyed much more than the others. After reading the scathing reviews I realize this film is not for the Avengers and Spiderman crowd who need everything explained to them with heavily wound exposition and action. Instead, similarly to the book as I've learned, much is left to the imagination and that is what makes it far more unsettling and creepy than exposition and motive vomit being thrown at the viewer in order for them to \"get\" it. This is one of the better 'ghost' stories I've watched because as a natural skeptic I believe it is important to understand the role a human psyche plays in a predicament like this. Many ghost films fall to the shallow 'Boo!' moment and not much more. This one was far more sophisticated like I was expecting and satisfying for me not ignoring skepticism, paranoia, suspicion, etc. The premise was simple but executed well. I prefer this kind of realistic ghost stories rather than the \"Boo!\" Let me exorcise you cause the exposition told me so, drivel that often plagues the more cliche ghost horror like the Conjuring and such. I really think this effort was a step in the right direction to modernize adult horror without the need of excessive gore, peddling religion or entirely over-exposed exposition /flashbacks etc. This film keeps the mystery real, raw, confusing, and creepy without overdoing it. I really hope other viewers can give this a chance for what it is, a well acted mystery thriller from the lineage of great gothic fiction. I was prepared to hate this film but I couldn't as I've found it's a nice companion piece to The Innocents, and is a cut above being far better than the cliche stuff it could have been. Finally a ghost film that walks that fine line. And I am so picky about this stuff. Really felt true to the 60s-70s but with some modernity.",

She is manipulated into playing a game she doesn't want to, and has a line like: \" I don't want to play anymore\". Then, don't. Nobody is forcing you, You should be the adult! Go drink a coffee. She is rude to the child when he plays with the ball, and why not stop the car when the little girl begs, if you know her parents died in front of her, near the gate?? In the end the director tries to make us feel sorry for her, by telling us that she is not stupid, she is crazy...The rest of the plot besides what I wrote is irrelevant. Nothing happens. A woman might be dead, killed by a dark villain who might also be dead, and the one from whom we know this information, might be dead as well. They might be ghosts or not. We don't care, because all characters were weakly constructed, and even if the kids were ghosts, we still won't care...

            "content": "I'm a big fan of Mackenzie Davis, and Finn Wolfhard has demonstrated strong capability. I'm less familiar with Brooklynn Prince, but I know she earned praise fro 'The Florida project.' I liked Floria Sigismondi's work on 'The Runaways,' and while I'm unfamiliar with Chad or Carey W. Hayes, I recognize that they have notable experience as writers. I've also watched other adaptation of 'The turn of the screw' and enjoyed them. All these are fine points in the favor of 'The turning' - set against what I recognize as poor reception, and moreover, I recognize there's a dicey record of trying to update period pieces. I'll watch anything, however, and I was ready to give this an earnest try.If nothing else is true, this is well made from a technical standpoint. I think Sigismondi's direction is great in terms of building shots and scenes, and the cinematography and editing are quite sharp. The on-site filming location is fantastic, and the work of costume design, and the hair and makeup artists, is rather suitable. The visual effects are also swell, I think, blending seamlessly into the footage. All this is well and good. However, are these the most important aspects of a film? In other regards, I can understand why 'The turning' is regarded so poorly.Maybe I'm just no longer used to watching horror movies that trifle with cheap jump scares, but there's a massive overabundance here, and they become tiresome quickly. Employed sparingly and fastidiously they can be useful; not like this. The same goes for general \"creepy\" imagery - there are good ideas here, but too many are just thrown at the wall, and as a result 'The turning' feels regrettably common and unexceptional. I either know that the cast is skilled, or at least trust that they are, but in this it seems like they're forced into small corners as the parts are written rather blandly. Mrs. Grose is hopelessly severe, Miles is merely a monster, Floria is a senselessly happy little girl, and lead character Kate is a very standard horror protagonist. I suppose the acting is fine, such as it is, but the ensemble doesn't have much to work with.We all know 'The turn of the screw' as a terrific ghost story, and it's been rendered into fine versions in film and TV. At the same time that characters are empty stock material, some of the dialogue and scene writing in this take is plainly contrived. There are robust airs present of supernatural horror, psychological horror, and mystery, but the narrative struggles with all the other elements of the screenplay. And even more to the point, the more that the story ramps up toward major atmosphere, fright, and climactic conflict and character drama, the more it seems terribly overfull, and overly busy - a veritable cacophony of noise both audio and visual, yet without significant substance.I was prepared to say, up until the last five minutes or so, that I don't think 'The turning' is entirely as bad as popular opinion would hold. Yet those last five or so minutes \"turn\" another corner, and make one realize how ruefully disordered the writing is. When all is said and done it's almost as though this movie lacks major rhyme or reason; it's sad and incredible how the same novel that produced, for example, 1961's 'The innocents,' and outstanding miniseries 'The haunting of Bly Manor,' also resulted in this. Despite everything 'The turning' had going for it, unfortunately it turned out to be a jumbled mess, and falls short in too many ways to earn favor. There are certainly worse movies out there, but when it comes to adaptations of Henry James' classic, maybe not.",

            "review_title": "\"The Little Tutor That Could\"",
            "content": "\"The Little Tutor that Could\"Floria Sigismondi takes the helm on her second feature-length film to adapt the 1898 ghost story penned by Henry James entitled, \"The Turn of the Screw\" for the umpteenth time. \"The Turning\" rehashes the same tired story we have seen countless times before. You think the crew would have learned from the shortcomings of the previous attempts, but of course, they didn't, instead, we are fed an awfully boring film that lasts far too long for its own good. \"The Turning\" is about as bland as a film can possibly get, from its generic overuse of poor jump scares to infuriating characters trapped in a by numbers the plot, there is hardly anything of substance going on throughout the entire hour and forty-minute runtime. The film fails to entertain in any capacity as it is neither scary nor funny (usually comedy can be siphoned out of bad horror films, but sadly not here) which leaves the film in a space of misery that will have audiences checking their watches every other minute.\n\"The Turning\" features a plot that is clearly inspired by the ghost story, \"The Turn of the Screw\" but with some minor detours. After the live-in-tutor of the Fairchild Residence is said to have gone missing, Kate Mandell (Mackenzie Davis) decides to take the job as the new governess of the estate. After saying a final goodbye to her logical roommate Rose (Kim Adis) and delusional mother Darla (Joely Richardson), Kate heads off to the Fairchild estate. Upon her arrival, things already begin to appear strange for our main protagonist including her first meeting with the children's caretaker, Mrs. Grose (Barbara Marten), who instantly expresses her doubts in Kate's abilities. Mrs. Grose gives Kate a full tour of the house getting her accustomed to the living quarters. Along the way, Kate runs into Flora Fairchild (Brooklynn Prince) and the two quickly become acquainted with one another. As Kate prepares to spend her first night in the estate, she hears a disturbance coming from the East Wing (an area she was barred from seeing) which prompts her to get up and investigate. Kate winds up discovering Miles Fairchild (Finn Wolfhard), Flora's brother who was supposed to be attending boarding school at the time. With all of the characters introduced, the story commences as Kate slowly descends down a well of madness witnessing numerous paranormal sightings as she becomes haunted by the unruly spirits of the Fairchild estate with no help from the Fairchild family.\n\"The Turning\" is a film that fails on almost every level, but Carey and Chad Hayes are the culprits that deserve the brunt of the blame. These two unified to write an utterly terrible script that will have you shaking your head and rolling your eyes with every scene that unfolds on screen. Let us start with character motivations (spoiler, there are none). Kate is a paper-thin protagonist that has no incentive of taking the governess job, yet she still does because \"she's a good person\", I guess? Her estranged mother is put on display like a stage clown as a quick way for the writers to vaguely hint at the fact that maybe Kate's family suffers from a delusional disorder. However, as the film progresses Kate's character only becomes worse. Despite seeing several ghosts and being tormented by every resident of the Fairchild estate, Kate refuses to leave and go back to her normal life; and when she escapes past the estate's gates and calls her friend Rose to vent about the misfortunate events that have transpired, she still drives back to the estate and attempts to mend everything with the family. No matter how strange and demented the kids are, or how many spirits she sees, or even the sound advice she receives from her roommate, Kate is determined to remain hostage in the estate because of a promise she made within the first day of meeting a little girl she knows nothing about. I am sorry, but if a film expects me to take it seriously while genuinely caring for the characters on screen, it is impossible to achieve when the characters are going out of their way to do things no sane human would do. Not to mention the fact that the film is set in the 20th century but only loosely resembles it with the appearance of some cars and cassettes (a waste).\nIn spite of the film's shortcomings, if I must point out some positives, they would be directed at Leonie Prendergast who was the lead costumer designer on the film and Paki Smith who acted as the film's lead production designer. Prendergast manages to create an extremely unique style for every character at the Fairchild residence. Kate leaps off of the screen in her bold outfits as they bleed with rich color that stands in stark opposition to Mrs. Grose's bleak and dull color palette of several shades of grey. From top to bottom, everyone's attire feels like something classic (from an era long ago) while simultaneously infusing a natural modern look that creates a distinct visual flavor that is rarely seen. The makeup crew should also be recognized alongside Prendergast because as the film moves forward, we not only emotionally witness Kate spiral out of control, but we see her physical appearance heavily alter as her hair and makeup become more wild and messy with every passing day. Another facet of the film that adds something positive to the experience is surprisingly the Fairchild estate itself. The setting by no means is as fascinating as the Overlook Hotel from \"The Shining\" or even the Mos Eisley cantina from \"Star Wars: A New Hope\", but it is an interesting location that is explored and shown off intentionally to get the audience to remember it's distinct appearance. A heavy fog rolls over the hedge maze, the deep blue pool shimmers under the night sky, the massive oval-shaped pond is flooded with fish; all of these key locations are presented to give the estate some character. Unfortunately, most of these locals are used once or twice with little to no payoff (I would suggest you read the last paragraph to find why this was the case).\nSigismondi's talent behind the camera is on display throughout most of \"The Turning\" as she utilizes the camera in unique ways with some perspectives making it seem as though we are the ghouls watching over our prey from a distance. Sigismondi can visually craft a creepy ghost story, but that is about it. \"The Turning\" is a film with decent visuals that can in no way move beyond its myriad of dreadful issues. From dense and uninspired characters to a botched script with no soul, the film does absolutely nothing to earn its price of admission as most of your time will be spent thinking about what you'll be eating afterward. \"The Turning\" will surely melt your brain as it unceremoniously crawls to the finish line while slowly devolving into a bad episode of \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?\". However, for a \"horror\" film in January, what could I have possibly expected?Final Verdict: F",

A film like the Turning is sure to turn a few thoughts towards having more food for thought, and depending on what type of horror fan you are, will determine if you like it. Points for this reviewer are a fantastic setting established for creepiness and realistic flow. A good acting cast further brings the horror factor out and a more unique approach gets points in my book given how tough it is in this day and age. However, this new approach is also potentially a downfall for some as the movie gets really busy, with so much though and direction that you have to figure out if you like keeping track of everything. Scares took a hit for me in this film, and the slow pace itself leads to potentially a film that will not be the modern preference. Still, if you are looking for a thought-provoking movie, this piece should give you something to talk about and the theater can help elevate the ambience for sound, though I think the true terror will come from watching it at home.My scores are:Drama/Horror/Mystery: 6.0\nMovie Overall: 5.0",

The performances were perfectly adequate, the sets were too, but something just kept it all from becoming a successful MIX.Most likely studio heads butted in and caused it to be hurried and harried, who knows? But had the movie makers been allowed time to make the effort to make appropriate cuts and craft this movie in the way it should have been, it could have been GREAT! It simply wasn't. Watchable, yes. Great, unfortunately not.This is an updated remake of Henry James', \"Turn of the Screw\" which has several movie incarnations already. In this version, they're attempting to make statements about mental illness, and it's a shame they missed the mark so completely. There is nothing overtly frightening in this, it's more psychological in its scares, and would have been a wonderful way to broach the subject of mental illness too, but alas, they failed.Still, the movie is worth a look, if you like grand old homes and their grounds and snooty housekeepers, and Hellion THOROUGHBREDS disguised as children being cared for by incompetent governesses.",

The movie definitely started conversation after it was over... I enjoyed it very much and want to see it again. The reason I didn't give it a 10 is because I had to explain what happened to my Best friend, she was just a little confused on a few things. This movie basically ends how you want it to end.

The production design is perfect and charming, and the cinematography is striking and at times pretty inventive.We used to get a lot of gothic ghost stories, but they've been much less popular in the last couple decades, and most of what we've seen has been pretty bad. This movie is a gem in that respect -- a good haunted house movie.My one complaint is that I think they may have cut some interesting stuff, perhaps to secure a PG-13 rating, which is disappointing.

It's just an actual mannequin in one scene, and OBVIOUSLY a woman in makeup in the other, turning her head. Which reminds me - I forgot to mention the few \"effects\" there are, are bad also.But hey, it's not all bad. Finn Wolfhard is as great as ever, and the woman playing the creepy housekeeper is perfect for that role. The rest of the cast is either terrible or aggressively generic. And as generic as the whole movie is, it does pick up steam halfway through, albeit with shallow jumpscares with no substance. It's so generic, in fact, that at one point the little hand from The Addams Family shows up for a pointless jumpscare... Nothing makes sense. The house is haunted - go wild, I guess.

The remaining less than 5% is also fairly straightforward and is pretty much just \"Kate meets with her mother in an asylum, talks to her former roommate to vent\".\nThere is simply nothing, either overtly or covertly, that can be interpreted to mean anything other than what the rest of the film is. As such, the ending, what ever it was trying to pull, did not come out of anything in the film itself.\nAs an example this would be the equivalent of a story of a woman buying a car, driving it around her neighborhood, pulling into her house, and walking in on her husband cheating on her, then going mad and killing him, only for the revelation that she actually died in a car accident as soon as she bought the new car.\nIt just does not follow.

The plot twist is where I felt this movie had its biggest flaw. The movie was not perfect prior to it. It used the same tropes a lot of mainstream horror movies have such as setups for jump scares and objects moving even when they don't really contribute to the story. Its 90s references were unnecessary and I barely even noticed them. However, I was actually enjoying the movie. The cast is solid, the little girl was a standout, and the plot became more intriguing as it went along. The movie held my attention and I was never really bored.And then came the plot twist. Its reveal was oddly abrupt and felt rushed. If the movie had rewrites, the twist probably could have been integrated into the plot much better. However, I think the movie would have been just fine without a plot twist because the climax that preceded the plot twist was actually pretty solid and entertaining. It felt as if there was an ending they filmed but they decided to cut it and insert a plot twist before said ending was shown. The plot twist made a lot of the setup and backstory feel pointless.I did not hate this movie anywhere near as much as a lot of people did but it would have been better if it weren't for its plot twist.

The real issue I had with this movie is with the modernization. I mean it's the mid 1990's not 1890 so what is going on.

            "content": "The Turning (2020) is based on the book The Turn of the Screw by Henry James. As of the time of this review, I have not read the novella, but it is on my to-do list. This review focuses solely on the film experience.In The Turning, the plot involves Kate and the brothers Miles and Flora Fairchild, orphans who live in a secluded mansion far from society. Kate accepted the position of housekeeper as the former housekeeper tragically died. The Fairchild brothers' parents also tragically died. Hum...The plot is monotonous for a while. The presentation involves a series of expositions that should lead to the main complication, but it doesn't. Kate grew up without her parents, but we soon discover that she has a mother who is admitted to the strangest psychiatric hospital of all, after all, what mental hospital would leave its patients inside an empty swimming pool? Flora also doesn't have parents and that's the connection between Kate and her. However, the connection is weak. The movie wants to make it clear that this connection is natural and obvious, but it doesn't work so well.Flora has psychological problems because of her personal experiences. Her first interaction with Kate feels fake and forced, which leads us to believe that perhaps Flora is questionable. The film doesn't make that clear.The film introduces us to the horror element when Flora shows the house to Kate. \"I don't walk around that part of the house,\" Flora says to Kate, referring to the east side of the mansion. The plot does not use this element to develop the story.Miles quickly steals the show. The plot that seemed to focus so much on Flora and Kate disappears and makes room for Miles and Kate's relationship. Flora, despite being in a poster version of the movie and appearing in several key scenes in the trailers, becomes secondary. This twist causes Kate's interaction with Flora to not gain the strength it should have to justify Kate's subsequent acts.Miles is the typical troubled son of a tycoon. Spoiled, arrogant, but clearly with internal problems. Kate and Miles' relationship starts off bad and develops into something with little meaning. Miles seems sexually attracted to Kate, but the plot doesn't explore this theme; the plot only focuses on how the children seem to want to disturb Kate with childish but dark games.As the plot moves towards the maximum event, I felt that the plot was not plausible for themes we see throughout the movie:Miles' sexual attraction to Kate.Flora can't leave the house, while Miles seems unimpeded.The fatal accident of Miles and Flora's parents.The climax is a sequence of unexplained jumpscares. I understand that scares are cinematic techniques, but it got to the point where there were so many that I was anesthetized.The ending made no sense. I know that the intention is precisely to open up for interpretation, but the questions are so many that the interpretation is that this film got convoluted. The existence of an alternate ending makes it clear that the writers didn't know how to connect all the conflicts they generated. The alternate ending is more straightforward, but doesn't do the plot justice.When the movie ended, I felt there were too many holes to ignore. Unnecessary scares, scenes that contradict the outcome, open questions. I wouldn't recommend it, either for the horror factor, which is just a collection of jumpscares, or for the story factor, which ends without much sense.",

Though at times it can fall into cliche territory, it mostly remains an ambiguous and bizarre film.Its strengths lie in the performances of the main actors, especially the performance from McKenzie Davis. She captures very well the sense of paranoia and slow mental decay that the movie tries to portray. Some great cinematography also adds to the film's dark, psychological vibe.The problems really show themselves in the plot and underlying structure (or lack thereof), specifically towards the last quarter of the movie. While I believe it was the intention of the director and writer to be strange and difficult to follow, I can't help but feel like this film could have been much better with a few changes and resolutions to the ending of the film. Couple this with a few easy-to-predict jump scares, and the movie just doesn't quite reach its potential.At the end of the day, this film is a unique and intriguing horror movie. It's definitely not for everyone, but those seeking a dark, psychological detour will probably view this one multiple times. It leaves much up to the imagination and leaves the viewer with many questions. If not an instant or cult classic, The Turning is at the very least a fun and intellectually challenging thriller.",

Unfortunately this is where this film falls incredibly short. It goes in hard and fast with the big haunted house cliches and lays the uncanny on really thick.One of the devices writers like to use in contemporary horror is removing the potential for use of mobile phones either by placing the action with in an area where they can't get a signal or in a time before cell phones existed. We know it's 1994 because Kurt Cobain is dead. Throughout the film there are occasional references to Nirvana and bits of Grunge to remind us. It all feels a bit unnecessary.The shadowy figures in mirrors is repeated too often, as is the bad dream sequence so after a couple of times it loses its impact.Another thing that annoyed me is how it's blatantly obvious that this was filmed in England yet its set in the USA.But these are minor issues in a story that is frustratingly unfulfilled. Finn Wolfhard seems to have cornered the market in weird edgy teens which he does executes with aplomb but like the rest of the film it's unremarkable.",

The four main actors are actually all very good but sadly the script they have to work with is awful and the direction not much better. The film is peppered full of set pieces that often seem crow-barred into the story and usually fail to impress despite starting well.I think the key problem of the script is that the main character, the live-in teacher for the youngest of two orphaned children living, never really behaves like a teacher, or even a adult - often coming across more like a disgruntled babysitter - and there is never a set up of any normal relationship with the youngest child. Everything starts odd and only gets a little bit odder. In fact I think that's it. It's a film where none of the relationships - even with supernatural characters - seem real or complete. So many story threads and nothing really ties very well. By the end you wonder how many more dream sequences are to come and is any of this really going to be explained.So does it even work an a pure jump scare horror movie? Well the house and the darkness set up some high expectation but you never really get the feeling there is any real threat. One sequence has all the terror of an Adam's family reunion (you'll know the bit when you see it) and the final piece has the sort of effects you expect to see in an afternoon TV movie. So nope, sorry.Which brings us to the end of the movie. Ok no spoilers, but it's safe to say that it feels as though they never really had an idea how to end this film. So the \"Oh, for f*** sake\" ending, which looks like it was made up of left over footage, leaves you feeling like you came back into the the wrong theatre after your toilet break.In short, this is not a great movie. Even a good cast couldn't save a poor script and the inability of the director to make the most, or anything, out of those potentially scary moments. I did quite like the songs used in the original soundtrack though.",

Since I had some idea of what to expect, I was still interested in watching the movie, as I had so enjoyed the other adaptation. At one point I got up to get a drink and paused the movie and saw that there was only 33 minutes left, at which point I said to myself \"My god, when is this going to get interesting???\". The answer, it turns out, was never. It was only mildly spooky and hardly a psychological thriller, despite its obvious, desperate desire to be one. The ending is one of the worst I've seen. I literally said \"That's it?! THAT'S the end?!!\". The Haunting of Bly Manor is a far superior adaptation, although the actors portraying the three main characters in this film are very good.

            "content": "As a remake of The Turn Of The Screw/Les Innocents, this was distinctly heavyhanded and overwrought. The power in that original story is how much is left up to interpretation; is it a haunting or a descent into madness? Is it a supernatural horror or a psychological thriller? Just exactly *how* close were the dearly departed to the children in their care? And the harrowing darkness of that original ending lends the film entire much of its impact.\nThe Turn belabours too much to do an adaptation of that story tonal justice, while explaining too little to be a fair introduction of any new viewer to the tale.HOWEVER, that said; this is a reasonably high-quality distinctly post-2000s -style horror when taken on its own merit. The production values were fantastic throughout, performances nuanced and convincing, and the tension built deftly. The now-ubiquitous jump scare tool was used in good balance with genuinely effecting suspense, and after the initial introductory slow-burn, the pace, once it picks up, escalates frenetically by the minute - to point where the hectic whirl of events has the viewer completely along for the ride with our heroine in no longer knowing what's real or not.\nIt's certainly better-acted and more emotionally compelling than the bulk of its contemporary fare.So, the TL version is; if you're looking for a delicately-woven and slowly-played gothic horror with an ending of guttingly horrific tragedy, then look elsewhere.\nIf you're in the market for ghosts and gasps with some solid performances and a breakneck pace post-orientation, as well as a close-up portrait of a likeable protagonist rapidly degenerating under trying conditions, then you could do a lot worse.\nIt's well worth a bucket of popcorn on a weekday night.",

The actors for the most part are giving their all to this script, and there are some commendably coherent performances. The cinematography is decent and the Victorian mansion motif is very consistent with the story. I think it's a good looking film.There are also some huge problems with the mood and pacing, and some awkward and stilted scenes that are actually kind of bad. I would still recommend watching this. Go and expecting to laugh once in a while, and be prepared to hate some of the parts of the film, but I command the actors with some exceptions for their work here.",

This movie takes place in the 80s, 90s or modern day, I am not sure. Discarding it's period setting should've and could've worked if they had just specified a time period. I was so damn confused and it's not like It Follows where not knowing just helps us.Another part I disliked was the scares. Again, did this movie want to be this atmospheric horror or just a jumpscare pop corn flick? Even the movie couldn't decide it. There's one solid scare and one moment of genuine creepiness but that's about it. Again, the gothic atmosphere is thoroughly underused.One thing I did like was the performance from Mackenzie Davis, going from annoyed to scared, she really does a good job. Finn Wolfhard is just there and he really tries to be this creepy kid but it doesn't work, he should go back to his 80s era wisecracking roles. No offense to the actor. The scene stealer here is definitely the little girl Brooklyn Prince who really shines through.The story is slow, and then fast and the slow. Let me elaborate. In the beginning, the story takes it time to settle which I was all for it. It was building up to something. But then by the middle we are just shown a couple of scene so fast, one after another, I thought I'd need a breather. And then the end happens... the ending was just unsatisfying and just plain confusing or even lazy.I caught this movie as a premiere and I heard the director say that she made it in such a way that she wanted the ending to be open to interpretation but I say give us something solid story wise for us to make our own interpretation. All this while we're seeing this story develop as a ghost story and then in the end you make it seem all intellectual or mental or whatever, it just won't work. I just didn't care enough to make my own interpretation.I think everyone should go and watch it and form their own opinion. Don't expect something grand or you'll be disappointed like me. I had such high hopes for this adaptation of one of my favorite book but I guess I'll have to wait for another adaptation to come into fruition.I will give this movie a four out of ten. 4/10. That 4 simply because of the little girl and that one scene involving a mannequin.",

            "content": "This movie, it, well, I can't put into words exactly why I felt it was one of the most abortive, senseless, maligned and unimaginably misdirected and written films I have ever seen.Firstly, my opinions are completely based on a comparison between this version of Henry James' Turning Of The Screw, and the 1961 version, The Innocents, starring Deborah Kerr. Other than the fact that they both share the same basic premises -- Governess is hired to look after and teach a pair of wealthy, privileged children, and becomes embroiled in a good vs. evil battle to possess the children's (the \"innocents\") souls.Besides those broad plot points, there is no resemblance between the original, brilliantly crafted by Jack Clayton (director), and this senseless, predictable and wholly unimaginative remake. The story veers so far from the original that whereas the original, to this day, remains one of the most chilling and provoking horror movies of all time,The Turning becomes an insult, a hollow deceit.The ending is absurdly random, and obviously nothing more than a misguided attempt by the director to force some kind of shocking \"twist\" to justify Universal calling it a \"horror\" film. More reprehensible still, is the claim that this movie is a re-imagining, or modern interpretation , or an alternate version of Henry James' horrific classic.I normally would not try to obliterate a film just because I did not personally enjoy it, but when a film as precious as The Innocents is smeared by what many modern audiences will have as their only source by which to form their ignorant assumptions that The Innocents is just another unwatchable Turning of The Screw miscarriage. So, what makes The Turning any more significant than another Hollywood example of settling for mediocrity? This -- because it will indirectly also cause those who see it with no desire, no motivation to see a film which was revelatory and groundbreaking Which in turn may lessen the future chances of a moviegoer to be transported and elevated and gain insights which allow us as a species to evolve and explore.And that's why I felt the need to hopefully reverse some of the damage The Turning has caused, by encouraging moviegoers to instead, rent, buy or stream The Innocents. Remind yourselves of what it feels like to be entertained. To be transported. And scared.",

So far, so not terrifying in the slightest!The character of Mrs Gross is different, the Uncle does not feature at all and Quint and Jessel look like they missed their audition for a Grunge band and ended up in this movie instead.Then we have Kate ... and her mother ... and a totally different ending.

A great number of viewers weren't as happy with the ending as I was, but if the movie ended only with everyone escaping, we all would have been disappointed. Choppy editing of convoluted events together and the ending scene of Kate screaming at her mother's reveal did make the movie better.",

It's a novel about ambiguity in so many ways, and that's a literary style not easy or maybe even possible to translate into film. From the previews, I expected the movie to be just elements of the book reworked into a basic horror film. What I liked is that the movie made an effort to retain the two possible readings of the book, and I appreciated that since it's what makes the book special. The acting was also pretty great. Although, the ending pretty much settled on a singular interpretation.To me, it seemed like they wanted to do a modern retelling, but that proved to be too difficult to write with today's easy access to communication. It's something to contend with in any modern horror - long gone are the days of being really isolated, an environment necessary for so many horror plots to succeed. So, it seemed that the filmmakers thought the next best thing would be to set the movie in the 90's. Don't get me wrong, I'm a product of the 90's and enjoy the nostalgic aesthetic, but for it to really work, there needs to be a reason to set something in the 90's other than it making the writing easier as it's the decade most recent since technology.I agree with many of these reviews - too many jump scares early on lost the suspense. To me, it's getting rated a little low, but then again, that's to be expected when you leave an audience with an ending like that.",

The writing is questionable, which is surprising because the Conjuring and the Conjuring 2 are so well done, though I suppose their lack of experience might contribute to this flop. I'm almost forced to assume there was more and it just got cut to pieces because the director, looking at her IMDB, is more known for music videos, which not necessarily story based. I'd never seen anything from this director, so I have to place the blame there.She's given us a jumbled mess that makes no sense. As the title says, we have a bunch of bricks, but we have no house. I do enjoy ambiguous film, if done well (ie, Inception, The Haunting (1963), The Shining). This story, the way it's presented to us here, does not leave very much to the imagination, explains things very badly, and then gives us an extremely ambiguous ending.This is a head-scratcher, but not in the good way where you want to watch the film again and again. This is a head-scratcher that will drive you to youtube for explanation videos or to other movies about the same content altogether.",

The last 5 minutes of the movie was like they were showing us a different movie, or an alternate ending, or a couple alternate shots they left in by accident. The whole entire theatre made a resounding \"WTF!?\" sound. I have to say that I'm giving it a 4 because I liked the scenery, I liked the acting and I didn't hate where it was taking us. I just can't understand what the heck happened at the end. I need answers. It felt unfinished and not in a \"good artsy\" kind of way. More of a \"if you don't get it you can't always have the answers you entitled swine\" kind of way. Anyways others gave it a lower rating, and I dont blame them. But I usually know what I'm heading into when watching these kind of movies, I know it's not going to be an Oscar contender, so I enjoyed it enough. And if the ending wasn't cut off like that, I would have given an extra star or two.Mackenzie Davis was really great in this. She basically carries the whole film, and does a very good job at it. The little girl was cute and suspicious at the same time. I really like Finn Wolfhard. I think he shines in everything I've seen him in; he has a depth that not many child stars do to be honest. Actually adult actors included. So all in all, my twin sister and I were entertained enough.Spoiler alert:\nI really wish they would've explained more. Was she supposed to be crazy like her mother? Or was she supposed to BE her crazy mother? Or did the house make her crazy? What happened? It seemed like they escaped and then all of a sudden she's looking at her mother's drawings. For a second I thought maybe the twist was that her mother's not crazy but that she has some kind of psychic abilities and others just label her as crazy. And maybe she showed her daughter what was going to happen through her drawings? But alas, no. Either the house made her crazy or she was crazy all along, or none of the above, and either way I'm not happy. Felt like the very end of Babadook but not done right at all. Also, I think the whole storyline about Quint and the last nanny was not fully developed. Did he also kill the children's parents to gain control over the manor? Why did he have power over the manor even after he died? Just because he was a creep? Why did The older woman not take call the authorities about the the nanny's murder? I also thought that maybe this was supposed to be like The Others and that's why the kids wouldn't leave the manor. But I guess not... I guess the protagonist is just crazy or something?I now read that this was based on a book. A book that The Others (a much better film) was based on. And the upcoming season of Haunting on Hill House will be based on it too. Obviously it didn't go exactly by the book because it was different than The Others. So wtf happened? Hopefully Haunting on Hill House season 2 will be different than this movie too.Anyways, if they ended it when they escaped, or at least further developed the ending... I would've been much happier and given this a better rating. And to be honest I think my rating is already 1 star too generous.",

She just says she wanna make a difference, but how teaching for 1 girl will do that, that teaching for 25 kids won't?All of a sudden, her brother shows up, with no previous announcement. He is young, but as the eldest heir and only man in the house, he takes some lead. He somehow gets interested on Kate, he even tries to kiss her, but then it's just gone out of the plot and forgotten.It's said the previous teacher left without giving goodbye to anyone, then slowly it's implied she was having some trouble and ended up being killed and was trying to ask Kate for help.There was this man Quint who's barely talked about. I believe he had an affair with that teacher, then she changed her mind and rejected him, and he forced on her, maybe raped her, and ended up killing and throwing her body on a lake. Then Mrs. Grose, instead of calling the cops, drank Quint and led him into an accident where he died. Then, dead, he restarted abusing her and tried to harass the livings as he was able to.For most of the movie I believed that Mrs. Grose and Flora were unable to see the ghosts and were just living normally, while Kate had a little ability to see them, and Miles had a much stronger one, which allowed him secretly keep his friendship with Quint.But when the climax arrives, all that was being developed on the plot just changed. Miles wasn't friending Quint, in fact he was under his control and influence and was unable to free himself. Mrs. Grose was indeed able to see Quint and was just ignoring/pretending, and was killed just because scriptwriter didn't know what to do with her. Flora also sees him, just to make her a possible target to him and in need of protection.All the thriller feeling is also thrown away, as if all of a sudden the director was in a hurry to finish the movie and had to increase its pace. It's never explained why Flora was so afraid of leaving the place, there's probably none at all and that was created just to make them fleeing more dramatic, but then they just take the car and leave and nothing happens. Flora doesn't bother leaving, doesn't even cry, and Quint doesn't do anything at all to stop.The movie would be bad enough ending like that, but at least it'd be coherent. With no transition at all, we're just thrown a few days back in time and Kate's mother is shown crazy. Mrs. Grose says to hope her disease isn't genetic and Flora asks why is Kate crazy. This implies she was indeed with some sort of psychological illness and events not depicted on the movie made everybody on the house notice that.The last scene implies that Kate was on some sort of themed psychiatric institution with her mother. We don't know if she was visiting her, or if she was sent there after the events on the house, or if she was locked there and the whole movie was visions of her.",

It challenges the typical formula of a film: exposition, rising action, climax, and eventually a denouement, where unresolved matters are resolved & unanswered questions are answered. There was virtually no closure at the end, and a plot-twist was introduced instead. And some individuals simply do not enjoy movies that take a more unique approach, but that doesn't automatically deem the film bad. It may just mean those individuals don't want to have to think too hard. Personally, I quite enjoyed the unsettling & confusing nature of this film. It felt as if I was going mad alongside the main protagonist, Kate, and I wasn't sure who the true threat was. Was Miles trying to mess with her? Or was he being messed with too and they were both victims? Speaking of Miles, I truly believe he was the driving force that kept the story interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed the thrill of his unpredictable behaviour because it was nearly impossible to tell if it was due to mental illness and hormones, or if some greater force was afoot. It seemed like maybe a mixture of both. Overall, The Turning was NOT a horrendous film. It merely requires you to use your analytical skills to think deeper about what you saw, rather than handing you a straightforward conclusion tied up in a perfect bow. I admire the artistic direction and ambition of the film, so I will confidently say that I liked it, even if I may have my own minor critiques!",

Ugh.I do have a theory, and after spending some time online, I have found two others with similar theories so, maybe I'm on to something? It helps that I read the source material and had an assignment dissecting it in school.So, my theory is that miss Jessel, kate, and her mom are all the same character. Basically the whole movie is a delusion she had brought on by her inability to cope with the trauma of her sexual assault at the hands of Quint and he inherited schizophrenia. The hauntings are her subconscious trying to force her to see what had actually happened to her and the Kate character is her trying to process her guilt over abandoning flora. The paintings her \"mom\" sent were glimpses into her reality that triggered the dissolution of her delusion and she came face to face with herself at the very end in the pool (why we weren't shown her mother's face and also why she screamed out in horror).This theory does leave some plot holes though, particularly, the moment that the grandma doll's head turns after she's left the room.I could be way off, but the whole point of the original book's cliffhanger was to leave the reader wondering if the ghosts were real or if the governess was just going mad. I think that's what they tried to accomplish in the film but it was just executed soooooooo poorly and made the whole thing feel like they just sort of gave up on the whole thing.Overall, it was entertaining and would have been enjoyable had I left at the false ending.I wouldn't mind watching it again knowing how it ends to see if I can make a more solid theory on what the hell happened.",

For me The Turning is a good movie with an interesting plot. All the characters have a purpose in the movie and a purpose to keep us entertained.I honestly loved Finn Wolfhard in this movie he plays a really interesting antagonist. Mackenzie Davis also does a good job especially when she with Finn. Brooklyn does a good job from time to time. Sometimes it feels as if she is unsure of herself with it comes to her lines. The lady who played the head maid ( I forgot her name) also is convincing.The first half of the movie is good. You get a sense that something is wrong but you can't tell what it is. You don't know if it's the kids or the maid or the ghost that is messing with Kate. You don't even know if Kate herself is crazy. There are a few scenes that I really love that are another reason for why I give this movie a seven. Like how well the kids worked together.Now the bad part is that ending. Like whoever thought of that clearly wasn't awake yet. I would have been just fine if they did that \" false\" ending where Kate takes the kids and drives off. It really felt like they didn't know how to end it. Is Kate crazy or what? That is never fully explained. Are the kids possessed or just weird? There are moments where the kids are just off with Kate but that's never explained. They really should have sticked with the false ending.I really feel like you should give this movie a chance. It's not amazing but it's definitely not horrible. I'm a horror/ thriller movie lover since birth trust me it's not that bad. Plus this is a Pg13 Thriller movie I didn't expect to be jumping and scared out of my life. It was scary enough to get me to jump sorta. So give it chance.Ps I wish they put that spider scene from in the trailer in the movie.",

Take that one moment out and the whole she's crazy is totally plausible. Although finding the dead body in the lake lines up real well with ghosts trying to tell someone how to help them find the way to the \"other side.\"Now, with that being said, the first thing that we were taught in film school was never do a dream sequence unless it's something that is obviously a dream, like in the Big Lebowski, otherwise don't do it as your audience will feel cheated that they got invested in something for no reason at all, and boy did I throw my hands up in the air and say I'm done with this one.

            "content": "The book from where the film is inspired do not give us a clear ending either. Lots of questions are hanging in the air on purpose, even though a good reader can grasp between the lines... So if this filmic version tried to keep the mysterious atmosphere from the book it failed here and there, by using horror movie clich\u00e9d and predictable moments of fright, just like - ok, there she goes and she'll get a fright now behind that door, you bet? And where the movie tried to innovate from the book, it failed also by creating weak fictional veracity. For example, in putting the events to happen in the 90's it failed to create an acceptable explanation for these kids being educated like nobles so far from reality. In real life, could it be possible? Maybe, but in this movie this info is not satisfying enough to convince us. So differente from \"The Others\" (Am\u00e9nabar, 2001) - not inspired by Henry James but it could create a reliable and mysterious atmosphere, nothing obvious and with a very trustfull settlement of history time and environment. It's so sorry, because, as another reviewer said here, the casting is really good...",

I also thought that some things like with finn wolfhard's character they should've explained more? Per-say, why he had those weird moments where he would randomly like kiss her or whatever that was gross bc he is a child and that is a grown adult... in my mind i think maybe that was like the other guy that died possessing him? But idk weird weird weird. I obviously haven't read the book but i feel like they could've gone so much further with this and then they just forgot the plot at the end. Very disappointing. But i did love finn wolfhard's performance in this. And the little sister was so cute! Props to the main girl for going crazy tho and then being a real one. I would watch it again maybe if i forgot about the entire thing and then re-found it.",

Miles smirked at the idea, knowing it would take them right back.Although if this were the case, the spirit was selective on its hold over them. Kate left earlier for a new coi.At the end Kate believes she sees her mother in a dry pool - while the viewer is not being shown her mother's face, likely a reflection of herself. But could it also have been the face of the drowned Miss Jessel. Was it the same pool? Thus, Kate becoming Miss Jessel.If after all it was all in her head, well that has been done before.",

I have also seen a majority of adaptations of 'Turn of the Screw' and have thoroughly enjoyed them all for the most part. I had high hopes for this adaptation as well but oh boy was that a mistake.Despite having an all-star cast, and a seemingly fantastic crew, 'The Turning' leaves a lot to be desired. We start off with our main protagonist Kate who has a mentally ill mother, and has been hired as a live-in tutor for a young girl from a prominent family. After we meet the rest of the main characters which consisted of the young girl Flora, her older brother Miles, and their nanny/housekeeper Mrs. Grose. As you would expect as the films go on things get increasingly spooky but nothing ever really happens. We never understand why any of the characters are doing what they do.Miles seems like a very confused kid but we aren't ever aware as to why? I mean, yeah, his parents died and so did his mentor but he's not just an angry teenager. At times his behaviour is manipulative, demeaning, and cruel. It is never really explained and frankly inconsistent.Flora is your average creepy little girl in a horror movie. Honestly nothing special about the character in this adaptation despite the best efforts of the young actress who portrayed her.Mrs. Grose was another wildly inconsistent character. Starts off as an uptight but obviously loving caretaker of the family, and then turns into a cruel, demeaning, and morally questionable woman. No explanation as to why, it just is.Now as all the other reviews have pointed out already the ending really leaves you thinking \"Wow. What a waste of my time!\" Around the 8 minute mark you're left feeling excited and then abruptly disappointed. Out of nowhere the films take 100 steps backwards and the last 20 minutes is irrelevant.This film could have been so good but who ever wrote the ending, and the character development needs to find a different genre to focus on.",

            "content": "Pros: The acting was good enough. The main character's actor, Mackenzie Davis really does sell that she is terrified, even if we really aren't. Brooklyn Pierce is loveable as Flora- much less annoying than Miles, played by Finn Wolfhard. This, plus IT and The Goldfinch, really cemented the range that Finn Wolfhard is capable of. Despite this, though, you can't help but be worried for both of the children. From the start, the movie raises some good intrigue.Cons: Sadly, most of these questions go unanswered. Why is the housekeeper so weird? We know she knew Quint killed Miss Jessel, and she then she killed Quint, but the reason to her odd devotion to the family remains unclear. What is going on with Miles? We never find out- it is implied he is possessed or influenced paranormally by the spirit of Quint, but it's also possible he's just a huge jerk. The movie really needed more time- it was too short for what it was. It felt like it was all buildup with next to no climax. Unfortunately a poor movie. If you want something with an old, large house, a complex mystery, and rich children, watch The Others. Much more worth your time. Finn Wolfhard fans (because I know you're here): if you want something paranormal with him in it, watch Ghostbusters: Afterlife or IT (2017). If you want something in which his character is no longer a sniveling nerd and rather an edgier character with dubious morals, watch The Goldfinch. If you were just watching for Finn it doesn't matter anyway.",

Characters were completely changed simply for the sake of being superfluously creepy and thereby discarding any of their original substance. However, none of the frightening scenes from the book (for example, Quint on the stairs or looking in through the window) were used in the film. The only reference to the novella's ambiguity came from an unclear ending, which only confused the audience instead of encouraging them to discuss Kate's sanity and whether the house was actually haunted.

On the other hand, and not surprisingly, the sexual elements of the story seem to have been completely ignored, which is a great shame as these are what makes everything far more disturbing. This adaptation is fairly entertaining but too hollywood (jumpscares galore), the \"modern\" setting did not serve any purpose either. I'd recommend watching Jack Clayton's masterful \"The Innocents\" and the film version of Benjamin Britten's opera from 1982 available on youtube; hell, even the 2009 BBC version is a descent take of this iconic \"ghost\" tale. Also all of the aforementioned adaptations keep the sexual implications intact, particularly Britten's opera.",

I think that even the people who made the film also were confused, showed that and could not come up with a better way to show such ambiguity.

I wasn't sure what to expect and in the end the movie turned out okay. Certainly a lot better than a lot of other reviewers make it out to be. Personally I thought the movie was rather creepy and suspenseful. I constantly felt uncomfortable throughout the majority of Kate's stay at the house.I am sure a lot of people would think she was crazy to have not leave or crazy to keep walking towards the creepy voices. It certainly did not make any sense of you heard strange voices on the middle of the night you would not call the police or at least grab a weapon or something.The ending was disappointing because it did not end like the book, which has such a good ending I don't see why it didn't. They even foreshadow the book's ending a few times. Ignoring the book, however, the ending is a nice twist. In essence the twists do pay homage to the title of the book, because it is like the turning of a screw where the story twists deeper and deeper, playing on the idea of unreliable narration. Is Kate crazy? Or is Miles purposefully trying to terrorize her? I wish the movie was more ambiguous because the ending leads us in one direction more. Personally I prefer films like Pan's Labyrinth where the film is left more ambiguous.",

He went from liking the main character to absolutely hating her. I don't know. I'm quite fond of Finn Wolfhard's work (Boris, Mike, Ritchie). But Miles just made me feel uncomfortable and just downright eerie when ever he would come on the screen. The Ending was meant to be set up to make a sequel but just left me super confused. Then Villain/(Monster??) was not scary at all at least in my opinion. The movie was set up so well but just didn't Execute as well as I hope. Anyways, all of this is just my opinion. Many might swear by this movie but it just wasn't for me. :(",

It's creepy and the actors are quite good but it's a bit of a ramble and doesn't make its point very clear. I also find myself feeling like the protagonist really didn't have real motivations to stay and put herself through all that. I don't think it deserves really low ratings, but it is a little bit mid, I don't love the twist ending if I'm honest I think it doesn't do what the writers thought it would.",

Great acting and cinematography, framing the set with an excellent gothic vibe that was needed by the plot.\nI could see how that ending may not be liked by some, but I seriously didn't expect so many. It was an ending that left so much unsettled that takes your mind to work. It has the true meaning of a movie that is going to leave a \"mark\", could easily be a topic of discussion because leaving things unsettled leaves the audience explore their fantasy and think their own meaning of the end. I personally love that kind of an ending.\nNever the less, the unsettled ending of the story, is hand in hand with the mysteries and secrets that could easily be behind big mansion walls and aristocratic \"pride\", so many urban legends about aristocratic families living in mansions like this one.",

            "content": "I was looking forward to this movie for a long time, I love both Mackenzie and Finn, so I was very excited to finally see this.I read the book in the couple days prior to this coming out, which I think helped me make more sense of what was going on than a person who had no prior knowledge of the plot. The children's dramatic mood swings mirror the unstable narrator's own mood swings - between seeing the children as helpless targets of the \"ghosts\", to them being in leagues to purposefully torment her. The awful dream reveal at the end being the result of her desire to \"save\" the children from a threat that probably doesn't actually exist. However, none of this is made even slightly clear in only the movie, so the characterization is extremely jarring. I think the interpretation of the Quint/Jessel subplot was very interesting and it definitely added a dynamic the book didn't have, however I don't think it was explored nearly to the extent it deserved.As for the good, this movie is beautifully shot and the sets are truly stunning, I wish I could steal all of the furniture they used. And that conservatory, oof.I think with just a tad more thought and effort put into the script, this movie could've been amazing, but that abrupt ending honestly soured the entire thing for me.",

There are literary analysis that allow for the idea that the 'ghosts' in the story are figments of the governess' imagination and that she is indeed insane, the novel is a bit ambiguous. However you cannot present a ghost story, as is initially done here, and suddenly in the last scene decide that it is a psychological thriller. There is no preparation in the plot for the teacher being mentally unstable, her mother not withstanding. That interpretation is also not the common one and is a definite outlier. The director has to make me believe it and she did not.At the close of this film I sat with my mouth agape wondering what it was that I just saw. The acting was adequate but the direction confused, many too many jump thrills. The cinematography was too atmospheric and moody, the entire film had an air of discontinuity. Also, personal aside, if these kids are not possessed, then they need a colossal whipping. The pranks they pull and their sense of entitlement, encouraged by the cook, is not to be believed. This is not part of the the teacher's psychosis as you see the scenes in the film and interpretation always starts at what the director shows you.",
