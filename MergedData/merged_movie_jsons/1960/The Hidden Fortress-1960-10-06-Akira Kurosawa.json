            "content": "Legendary director Akira Kurosawa has made a lot of great films, many of which have gone on to inspire whole areas of cinema. While Hidden Fortress doesn't represent his best, most influential or most important work; it's definitely an important movie in film history in it's own right, and besides that, it's a damn good movie to boot. I was most surprised at the amount of comic relief present in the movie. When watching a Kurosawa film, I always expect it to be a serious affair; so the comedy in this movie made for a surprise, which was, on the whole, a good surprise as like most things in Kurosawa's films; it works. The film has become most famous recently for the many parallels that it has with the masterpiece 'Star Wars', and it has become well documented that this film was a major influence on said movie, which is shown most clearly by the fact that a lot of the story is shown through the eyes of two bumbling people that aren't all that relevant to the central plot, and the style of editing; which George Lucas adopted many times in his epic trilogy.The plot follows a princess who must be escorted across enemy lines by her general. Two greedy peasants join the escort on the promise of a reward of gold. Like Star Wars, the plot here is relatively simple; and it's the way that the story is portrayed, not the story itself, that makes this movie great. Despite it's simplicity, Kurosawa gives it the style of an epic; and it really feels like one. Kurosawa regular, Toshir\u00f4 Mifune heads a great ensemble cast; all of which do well in their roles. Kurosawa had a great talent for pulling great performances out of everyone in his films, and he shows that talent excellently here. The cinematography is excellent, and the master director has managed to capture some truly stunning landscapes, which serve in adding beauty to the picture. This film is, of course, in black and white; and that is Kurosawa at his best in my opinion. While I loved 'Ran' and it's vibrant colours, black and white allows Kurosawa to blend atmosphere into his films, and they're always the better for it. On the whole, Kurosawa is a genius - and this is one of his best films.",

            "content": "Any Kurosawa film is worth watching, but the focus of interest shifts from project to project. This time around, his concern is the new aspect ratio of 'cinemascope' copied and renamed by Toho. Kurosawa is first a visual storyteller who scripts in pictures, each one dramatically framed. All his life until here, that frame was the same, but all of a sudden it changed.It is a matter of there being three territories where there was formally one. The new territories are on the left and right, which in the original cinerama were actually two additional cameras. One really needs to study his framing in the old format to understand how significant this challenge was. He was master -- indeed largely the creator -- of a visual grammar and the rules had changed.As with all his scripts, the story reflects his own challenges. So we have a story about three territories and a journey that spans them all. The 'middle' territory is under attack, and our characters must leave their fortress and go all the way from left to right to survive. (Notice the symbols he uses for these three klans.) The two hapless peasants represent to the story what actors represent to the 'real' enterprise of film-making: relatively ignorant, gold-chasers, likely to turn on each other, and liable to go where they are not supposed to. The story is told from their perspective. The gold in the story is hidden in sticks. The gold in the film is hidden in similar harvesting of nature by the eye.(Mifune's pride and Kurosawa's control were much like that shown here between Mifune's samurai and the peasants. Mifune would eventually run away from Kurosawa's -- probably much needed -- overbearing command. Mifune would end up wealthy and celebrated in Japan. Kurosawa not so.)At the end of the story, the peasant-actors are on a grand stair that mirrors a similar stair we saw earlier which was the scene of a huge conflict (in turn mirroring the battle on Eisenstein's Odessa steps in 'Potemkin'). But this second time, we are at peace, the frame is serene. Kurosawa has wrestled this new eye and mastered it. Kurosawa did not respond to the wide format like his American peers who preferred awesome panoramas. His approach to framing had always been layered, usually three layers of activity in fore, middle and background. Here, he was able to relax the axis so that the layers did not have be so much on top of one another. And he reinvented his strategy of panning of motion: compare a running sequence here to the famous woodcutter's running in the beginning of 'Rashomon.' Look at how he panned the General's attack on horseback. He still does diagonals, but fewer, less steep and with less static import. He now has more natural horizontals in his greytone/greystone arrangements so has to create more artificial verticals.Obligatory Star Wars comment:I am sure Lucas' film school professors would have explained the relationship of story and visual challenge this way. So that is the real template Lucas took in conceiving his project. His goal was a similar marriage of the visual (space) with story (Joseph Campbell inspired myth). His hidden gold is that miraculous alchemical element in Jedi blood.",

            "content": "In the Sixteenth Century, in Japan, Tahei (Minoru Chiaki) and Matakishi (Kamatari Fujiwara), two rascals and greedy peasants, are trying to return to the city of Akizuki through Hayakawa, after an unsuccessful attempt of making money with the war between the clans of Yamana and Akizuki. While warming themselves in a fire, they find gold with the symbol MT. Suribachi of the Akizuki hidden in the firewood, and they decide to search for other branches. Tahei and Matakishi meet General Rokurota Makabe (Toshir\u00f4 Mifune), who is secretly protecting Princess Yukihime (Misa Uehara), and without knowing their identities, they accept to escort and help them in the transportation of the gold through the enemy lines to Akizuki.\"Kakushi toride no san akunin\" is a delightful movie, indeed another masterpiece of master Akira Kurosawa. The screenplay is amazingly wonderful, having action, comedy and code of honor. Toshir\u00f4 Mifune is perfect in the role of the samurai that is assigned to protect his princess no matter the cost of the life of his young sister; Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara are hilarious in the role of two greedy rascals, ready to betrayal, cheat and risk their miserable lives for gold, and responsible for the funniest moments along the story; the very gorgeous Misa Uehara is stunning in the role of a princess, showing personality and a very noble behavior. Summarizing, it is a perfect movie, with fantastic locations and costumes and magnificent choreography of fights. I intended to use the saying \"Hide stones among stones, men among men\" said by Makabe to the peasants as the title of my review, but I noted that another IMDb user had the same idea. I read on the cover of the DVD that George Lucas inspired his franchising \"Star Wars\" in this movie. This was the first time that I watched \"Kakushi toride no san akunin\", which was unknown for me, and I really recommend it to any audience. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"A Fortaleza Escondida\" (\"The Hidden Fortress\")",

            "content": "Set during the Sengoku period (1460s-1600s), Akira Kurosawa's \"The Hidden Fortress\" stars Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara as Tahei and Matashichi, a pair of squabbling peasants. The duo roam the Japanese countryside, doing their best to avoid bands of marauding soldiers.\"Hidden's\" first act watches as Tahei and Matashichi are manipulated by Rokurota Makabe (Toshiro Mifune), a cunning samurai general. Promising the greedy peasants mountains of gold, he uses them as camouflage in his attempts to transport a princess (Misa Uehara) across enemy lines.\"What you make of another's kindness is up to you,\" Kurosawa has character's say. Kindness is something the film's princess learns, as she witnesses first-hand the sacrifices of her bodyguard, General Makabe, and the suffering of the peasants who live outside her castle walls. Kindness is also something General Rokurota must grapple with. He's a rival warrior with whom General Makabe fights an extended battle. During this battle, Makabe's objective is not to kill, but to frustrate, to deflect, to guide his belligerent opponent away from a fixation upon military solutions.\"The Hidden Fortress\" is one of Kurosawa's more playful films. Part comedy, part adventure, part action epic, the film boasts glorious widescreen photography, a jaunty plot, some fine compositional work and the shortest short shorts ever worn by a princess. Aesthetically, the film's the bridge between Eisenstein, Ford and later imitators like Lucas and Leone. Indeed, George Lucas would lift chunks of \"Hidden Fortress\" for the plot of his \"Star Wars\", especially Kurosawa's notion of a tough, imperious princess.Though a bit long-winded, a number of Kurosawa's action sequences still pack a punch. One sequence in particular recalls Eisenstein's Odessa Steps sequence in \"Battleship Potemkin\". Elsewhere Kurosawa stages a sequence in which General Makabe \u2013 cool, tough and resourceful - pursues enemy scouts all the way back to their base, a scene which would influence the speeder bike chase in George Lucas' \"Return of the Jedi\". Lucas would help a financially-strapped Kurosawa get his 1980 film, \"The Shadow Warrior\", produced. Indeed, Lucas would be indirectly responsible for two of Kurosawa's greatest epics (\"The Shadow Warrior\" and \"Ran\"). Every good apprentice lends their master a helping hand.8/10 \u2013 See \"Throne of Blood\" and \"Twilight Samurai\".",

They are constantly being fooled as they help the general.The fools, played brilliantly by Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara do manage to survive at the end and walk off together as friends. They are the most interesting part of Akira Kurosawa's film that relies more on characters than most of his other Samurai pictures.Of course, there is the pleasure of seeing Toshiro Mifune as General Rokurota Makabe, whose mission it is to save the Princess, no, not Leia, but Princess Yuki (Misa Uehara), who has the same spirit that Lucas used in Princess Leia.The rebel forces are, of course, fooled and the Princess and the gold they are carrying gets to a friendly province.Another fantastic adventure by Kurosawa and Mifune.",

            "content": "The Hidden Fortress is the Kurosawa film with the lightest tone. It's almost the most mainstream and entertaining. So for those who may have found other Kurosawa films to be too deep and poetic (if this applies to you, you're a fool) you'll be more likely to enjoy this. Even though there's a lot of comedy, mostly provided by the peasants, The Hidden Fortress still has all the power and uniqueness that all Kurosawa films have.\nThere are some amazing locations used. The rock slide provided for some real amusement. Toshiro Mifune gives a much more toned down and subtle performance than we normally see from him. What Mifune offers in Hidden Fortress is true screen presence. Without even saying a word he has your full attention. I love how Kurosawa plays the characters as well. The Princess is not a damsel in distress. In any American or British film of the 50s, she would have been nothing more than that. In this she's quiet for most of the movie, but then she'll come out of nowhere and show more power and confidence than The General. The peasant characters of Tahei and Matakishi are more than comic relief. They are primarily used for a laugh, but I thought there characters were unique as well. The story is told from their point of view, and they are essentially heroes, yet they do nothing but complain. They're greedy and selfish. These aren't characteristics that would normally be used for heroes, but Kurosawa makes them likeable to the audience. Some people have said this movie needed more action. I think the action it has is more than enough. The chase scene that leads into The General's encounter with his nemesis remains one of the best sequences Kurosawa ever Directed. The choreography in the swordfight holds up against most of The Seven Samurai's fight scenes, and it still tops the type of fights that have become tedious and repetitive in modern day movies. That fight is a great example of how to nail the Hero vs. Villain energy. Akira Kurosawa can do no wrong.",

Toshiro Mifune is enjoyable to watch as always, and although most of the story is played for action and/or humor, it does have a couple of powerful scenes as well.  The story of a defeated general trying to lead his princess past the enemy to safety is given plenty of twists and turns that give all of the characters some good moments.Along with all of the action, there are some pretty good characters, with Mifune, as the general, a big part of holding everything together in his interactions with all of the others.  The rather spoiled princess learns quite a bit about life, and the two greedy farmers learn - and often quickly forget - some lessons of their own.  There are also some good scenes with an enemy general.  Most of it works well, and it's an entertaining movie.",

            "content": "Two farmers (Tahei and Matashichi) are fleeing following a failed attempt to profit from a war but only ended up with them forced to buy the dead. Keen to return home with their lives, their escape sees them uncovering a couple of bars of gold hidden by the defeated kingdom. This in turn brings them to the attention of General Makabe \u0096 one of the few survivors of the clan, now going incognito and retreated to the hidden fortress in the mountains. Planning to kill Tahei and Matashichi, Makabe is impressed by their plan to escape to a neighbouring county by slipping around the fortified enemy lines. Promising them a share of the fortune, Makabe prepares to use them and their plan to get the gold and Princess Yuki to safety and rebuild the kingdom \u0096 however in as many ways as the two help, they seem to present endless problems and challenges.I came to this film off the back of a conscious effort to catch up with the many famous and influential films that accepted-wisdom tells me had been made by Akira Kurosawa. I was not aware of the Star Wars connection and did wonder why the DVD had an introduction from George Lucas; I didn't watch it but quickly caught on that the device of telling an adventure story via the involvement of minor, rather cowardly characters was replicated in the droids of A New Hope. Some reviewers here have clearly come due to this connection and have moaned about the thin connection (perhaps they confuse \"influence\" with \"remake\" and expected the latter?), however for me this aspect was \"of interest\" but was never at the fore of my mind. The reason for this was that the film effortlessly engaged me once it had spent a few minutes getting its characters through the mines (which is a bit confusing at the time but ultimately does help set the context for the remainder of the story) the story starts.By going through the two farmers, the film presents itself as a strange beast where we are riding along with cowardly and slightly unlikable characters while the \"heroes\" of the story are supporting characters even when their story is the main thread. It does work though because it prevents the film being about the higher, more honourable characters and becoming a simple adventure but instead has a bed of comic cowardice while also having action and adventure. If anything, the two minor characters are used to drive some of the story since some of the plot twists are problems caused by them. It is hard to describe how it works but I was surprised by how very quickly the 2+ hour running time slipped by and by how enjoyable it was. The cast are a big part of it as Chiaki and Fujiwara both play their roles really well \u0096 pathetic enough to be comic but never to the point where the viewer turns against them or dislikes them, which would have undercut their comedy value. Mifune easily pulls off the more heroic side of the film with a strong presence and a solid character in Makabe. Uehara doesn't have as much to do but she is a striking woman and works well with her looks while also producing an enjoyable tomboy style Princess.The Hidden Fortress is yet another film that makes me glad that I started going back through Kurosawa films to make sure I was making my own mind up rather than just accepting what everyone says. The film is an adventure set on a bed of comedy provided by its two main characters \u0096 who are actually minor characters within the context of the wider narrative. Those Star Wars fans looking to get something directly related to that series of films are coming to it for the wrong reason but Hidden Fortress is good enough to win them over and I suppose at least they are coming to it. The influences it would have didn't matter too much to me though because really the key impression on me as that of an enjoyable and comic adventure story that made for good viewing.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa has got to be one of the most influential and inspiring movie-directors of all time. Back in 1958, there wasn't really an action movie genre. This was before movies like \"North by Northwest\" and \"Dr. No\" were made, which both probably are the most influential and earliest 'modern' form action movies. The action movie genre had yet to be given its trusted form with its formulaic elements in it back in 1958. This movie is obviously an early step toward 'modern' action movies and it obviously inspired many later movies, both action movies as well as movies in other genres. Of course the most notable and best known example of this is the first Star Wars trilogy. Lucas was obviously inspired by this movie and he uses several plot elements, characters treatment and sequences from this movie in his Star Wars movies. Some references are more notable than the others and you'll probably discover new similarities on every new viewing.The story is simple but it's made unique through its storytelling. Instead of focusing on the main big heroic character, the main characters of the movie are two simple greedy peasants. The story is mostly told from their point of view which gives the story a whole different and interesting new dimension. It's a surprising and perhaps even daring approach of film-making but it works surprisingly well. It's not the story that makes this movie an unique one but it's truly the way of storytelling that does.The characters are constantly on the move or traveling, which gives the movie an extra sense of adventure.The whole way of acting looks totally different than the acting from European countries, America and the rest of the world. The style of acting might look a bit weird and perhaps also over-the-top these days, especially since we're simply just not accustomed to this way of acting. It gives the movie a style and feeling of its own but it at the same time makes the movie quite hard and not always as likable to watch. But the actors did their job and they served the story well, especially Toshir\u00f4 Mifune, who always is a pleasure to watch in a Kurosawa movie. All of the characters are given a very strong own personality in the movie.The setting in the movie are beautiful and the cinematography is good and nimble. Masaru Sat\u00f4 delivers a fine musical score for the movie, that fits the movie and its atmosphere like a glove.The movie has some great action sequences in it, that maybe are not too big or grand to watch but the way they are captured on screen and put in the story makes them very spectacular and awesome to watch at the very same time. The whole spear fight after the already fantastic chase sequence was an absolute highlight for me. It was absolutely brilliantly directed, timed and choreographed. Perhaps one of the very best and certainly most memorable directed sequence from Kurosawa. Of course there is plenty more action to enjoy in this movie, although perhaps not as much as you would expect at first sight. The movie is more adventurous and entertain than action-filled to watch.Yet again Kurosawa does not disappoint and delivers a masterpiece in his own unique way and with his own unique style. This movie is perhaps also more accessible than his other, mainly earlier, movies and the movie will surely entertain, even when you're not familiar with other Kurosawa movies or his style of movie-making and storytelling.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

The peasants bear a striking resemblance to Vladimir and Estragon in their infighting, negotiable affection for each other and their seeming inability to make any real progress toward any goal whatsoever. They are truly a venal pair, loveable only in their humanity and humor. I saw The Hidden Fortress on the Criterion DVD. Beautiful print but no commentary outside of a brief interview with George Lucas distancing himself from the film's alleged influence on Star Wars. It would have been nice to hear interviews with surviving cast and crew or a knowledgeable historian. Criterion also made a terrible choice in not translating more of the credits. Only Kurosawa and Mifuni had the honor of an English translation. Surely Misa Uehara, Minoru Chaiki and Kamatari Fujiwara deserve to have their names known to we who lack basic Japanese. The Princess and the peasants help make this movie what it is. I gripe too much though. Without Criterion (and Netflix)I would not have been able to see this movie at all.\nAgain, The Hidden Fortress is a great movie that also happens to be great fun. Highly recommended",

            "content": "Hidden Fortress has to be the most watchable and fun of all Kurosawa's pictures. While he made a lot of highly entertaining action flicks, Hidden Fortress is pure adventure. The pace never lets down for a second, but Kurosawa still finds time for poignancy and humanity.Kurosawa always aimed to adapt his technical style to suit the story and atmosphere of the picture he was making. Here he keeps his camera moving more than in any of his previous pictures, matching the speedy pace of the plot. He opens the film with the camera trundling along behind the protagonists, letting us know that we, the audience, are effectively following these two peasants on their journey. From then on this way of opening would become something of a Kurosawa trademark \u0096 you see at again at the beginning of Yojimbo and Redbeard.This was Kurosawa's first picture in the scope aspect ratio, and he appears to have embraced it right from the start. This is very much an outdoor picture, and there are plenty of massive landscape shots with scenery reminiscent of the plains and mountains of the American west. There is generally careful symmetry to his shot composition, with characters or points of action in the dead centre of the screen, which is actually not that common. However with typical Kurosawa adaptability the exception here is the two peasants, who simply scramble or sprawl all over the frame. It's also not very often you see a black-and-white film in scope, since in Hollywood with its all or nothing production values Technicolor and widescreen generally went hand in hand.The characterisation of the two peasants is perhaps a bit weak, as there really is no difference between the pair of them. While the two actors bring a slightly different manner to each of their characters, there is really nothing one would say or do that the other wouldn't. In his sleeve notes Philip Kemp describes them as \"a less lovable Laurel and Hardy\", but to me they're much more of a Tweedledum and Tweedledee duo.The music in Hidden Fortress is one of its best features, especially the incredibly powerful and rousing main theme. This is probably the first really great score from Masaru Sato, who had been working with Kurosawa since 1955's Ikimono no Kiroku.Despite the light feel of this picture, like virtually all Kurosawa's films from this era there is a warm humanism at its heart. While there is ruthless selfishness and little else in the first half of the story, the characters are changed by their experiences. By the end the upper class figures have learnt to see through the rigid structures of class, gender and that were so strong in feudal Japan. Even the greedy peasants learn to share. Maybe all that seems a little forced and unsubtle, but who cares? This isn't Kurosawa at his deepest, but it's great feel-good entertainment. At any rate, you come away from it feeling good about the characters.One final point \u0096 while everyone seems to know that this was a major part of George Lucas' inspiration for Star Wars, has anyone else noticed the similarities between Hidden Fortress and Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? A group of people who don't really trust each other and would as soon double cross each other as help each other, working together purely to get their hands on a fortune in gold, set against the backdrop of a war. Then again, these stories are as old as the hills and will keep on cropping up time and again.",

The movie itself is interesting and rather unusual in terms of the Kurosawa films I've seen. First off, the main protagonists are a pair of greedy, stupid peasants played primarily for comedic effect. The heroic characters are, in this movie, in supporting roles.It is also unusual in that it has a very strong female character. Kurosawa's movies tend to be very masculine, and this one is as well, but the girl is tough, proud, and noble, and replaces the quiet subservience seen from women in a lot of old Japanese movies with a ferocious appetite for life. I wouldn't say this ranks with Kurosawa's best films, being a little wandering in story and at times slightly puzzling in intent, but it is quite entertaining.",

            "content": "An inspiration for \u00a8Star Wars\u00a8series and deserving of its magnificent reputation and winning several awards such as : Fipresci prize , Blue Ribbon , Festival Berlin Golden Bear , and Kinema Junpo to best film . Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece about a princess , a laconic general samurai and two roguish , oafish hustlers . Set in Japan , XVI century , amid Civil wars , when Yamana and Akirakis clans were battling . It concerns two wandering , botchering peasants , a valiant general and a beautiful princess , Misa Uchara, escape throughout the dangerous countryside in seventeen century Japan and they find themselves various locations run by two parties commanded by feudal lords and their hired thugs . \nOn their way they meet mysterious roles , slaves, battles and many other things . It is full of injustices , inequity , violence and killings , due to the hordes of violent soldiers , murderers that inhabit it. \n This is a magnificent picture by Akira Kurosawa starred by his ordinary actor Toshiro Mifune , being an international breakthrough one . Steeped in japanese style and transports us to Medieval Japan and the world of Samurai . The impressive flick blends drama , humor , violent fights , emotion , slaughters with high body-count and results to be pretty entertaining as well as thought provoking .The film confirmed Kurosawa's greatest strength and his innovative handling of genre . It is incredibly detailed vision in its own right , as the impact of the action and combats on this trail-blazing adventure film opened the floodgates for the huge numbers of samurai films that made fortunes for their producers in the sixties and early seventies . Dramatically staged sword-plays occur on and off throughout the plot . Very good acting by Toshiro Mifune as a general Samur\u00e1i who attempts to protect and save his princess. This one made an international star out of Toshiro Mifune . Kurosawa's treatment is in part eclectic , there are reminiscences of Nicholas Ray's Johnny Guitar , John Ford Westerns , Serguei M Eisenstein's Potenkim (1925) and part truly idiosyncratic as the Shakespearean relations between heroes and clowns . Akira also uses a traditional style including the concept , symbols , plotting and utilization of Noh theatre music . It inspired Mel Gibson's Braveheart and George Lucas for Star Wars , 1977, and especially the two bungling peasants , Tahei and Mataschichi , similar roles to R2D2 , C3Po and a princess , Leia-lookalike , as well as Owi Van Kenobi like the brave general . It was clearly a big step from this to the delights of Yojimbo and Sanjuro . Being well shot in stereo and TohoScope , a CinemaScope version , and with a brilliant black and white cinematography . This fiercely-charging , uncompromising pictures was compellingly directed by Akira Kurosawa and being exhibited with subtitles or dubbed .After working in a wide range of genres, Kurosawa made this awesome film . The previous years saw the low-key , touching Living (1952) , the epic The seven samurais (1954), the barbaric , fascinating Shakespeare adaptation Throne of blood (1957) , a Macbeth's version , a masterful rendition that transports the story to Medieval Japan , and a fun pair of samurai movies Yojimbo (1961) and Sanjuro (1962) , and Rashomon , often credited as the reason the Academy created the \"Best Foreign Film\" category. When this film was released internationally to rave reviews, many speculated that Akira Kurosawa was influenced by Citizen Kane (1941) in the element of flashbacks that ultimately provide conflicting accounts of events. However, Kurosawa didn't even see Orson Welles's film until several years after . Rashomon won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, and first revealed the richness of Japanese cinema to the West. The successful \u00a8Yojimbo\u00a8 influenced in the known film Leone\u00a8For a fistful of dollars\u00a8is mainly cribbed from this Japanese samur\u00e1i action classic Yet , there was a quieter side to Kurosawa's nature , expressed most succinctly on Living , The Lower Depths and especially the medical drama Red Beard . After a lean period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, though, Kurosawa attempted suicide . Other important movies were : The idiot based on Feodor Dostowieski , Drunken Angel , Scandal , A quiet duel , Tiger's tale , High and low . He survived, and made a small, personal, low-budget picture with Dodes'ka-den (1970), a larger-scale Russian co-production Dersu Uzala (1975) an epic tale of adventure in turn-of-the-century Siberia and , with the help of admirers Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, the samurai tale Kagemusha (1980), which Kurosawa described as a dry run for Ran (1985), an epic adaptation of Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" . He continued to work into his eighties with the more personal Akira Kurosawa's Dreams (1990), and Madadayo (1993) and Rhapsody in August . Kurosawa's films have always been more popular in the West than in his native Japan, where reviewers have viewed his adaptations of Western genres and authors with suspicion , but he's revered by American and European film-makers, one of his least well-known films but most agreeable pictures is The Bad Sleep Well , a transposition of an Ed McBain detective novel , being remade many his pictures such as The seven samurais (1954), as The magnificent seven (1960),The Hidden Fortress (1958), as Star Wars (1977)as Yojimbo (1961) as For a fistful of dollars by Sergio Leone (1964), in fact Kurosawa's style was the biggest single influence on the Spaghetti Western sub-genre ; as his Samurai 'Western's were copied not only in America but also in Italy .",

            "content": "After dealing with some rather heavy material in Seven Samuari, Donsoko, and Throne of Blood, Akira Kurosawa decided to give a little light-hearted entertainment in this pure fun tale of a general and princess trying to smuggle gold out of enemy territory while having the aid of two bumbling and greedy peasants.Here, unlike nearly any film made at the time, the story is told through these lowly characters' eyes. From the opening sequence, we are introduced to these two peasants who seem more like brothers than friends as they love to fight as well as look out for one another. Portrayed by Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara, they provide plenty comic relief as well as the vessel through which we witness this story. The veteran general is played by the great Toshiro Mifune and does his usual outstanding job of exemplifying power and authority.Like any Kurosawa picture, the camera work and editing are absolutely top-notch. Using these two elements to increase the experience, Kurosawa creates a breathtaking story about honor, loyalty, and courage to do something dangerous as well as getting along with the people closest to you. Certainly one of his best, for all Kurosawa fans Hidden Fortress is not to be missed.",

            "content": "I think there are three great thresholds or paradigm shifts in film that have contributed much excitement to film fans, since the great masters have had to cope with the changes and try them out. The first was the advent of sound, the second the introduction of a wider aspect ratio, and the third the use of colour.All of the Kurosawas I've seen are beautiful poems. That this is Kurosawa's first film in Tohoscope, that is, in a wider aspect ratio than 4:3, is in itself an event. It would be 1970 when he would direct his first colour feature, although there's that effective use of colour in \"High and Low\" (1963).He is able to utilize space so well that both are thoroughly magical, and here the complete impotence of our two antiheroes is reflected in the large emptiness surrounding them, that is, loneliness in vastness, as used by Antonioni to great effect in a few year's time.I like his use of sand (and rock and boulders) in the film, especially since I'm also a big fan of Teshigahara and Imamura. They seem to have a life of their own, the rocks and boulders.And his portrayal of the violence of the mob towards the beginning of the film; the most exhilarating sequence involving stairs, far outdoing the Odessa steps as the ultimate example of not only violence and aggression but appropriation of class dynamics (it's the mutiny here that falls down from above). And the way he shoots the crowded streets and interiors, something beautiful in itself and worth looking for. And Mifune on horseback, chasing the two Yamana men, both his hands on his sword; an iconic moment that might be equally only by Nakadai's similar moment, with his bow and arrow, in \"Ran\" (1985).

            "review_title": "The Hidden Fortress, Star Wars Connection",
            "content": "I'm not sure that it is helpful knowing that George Lucas found inspiration for his `Star Wars' films in Kurosawa's historical epic, `The Hidden Fortress' (1958). Oh, there are a number of matters of content that seem quite similar. Though Kurosawa's story takes place in sixteenth century Japan and Lucas sets his in space in the future, the basic struggles are the same-the restoration of power to a princess and her clan. Some would compare Toshiro Mifune's General Rokurota Makabe to Harrison Ford's Hans Solo in `Star Wars' (1977), though there may be more  commonality shared with Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker. And the two peasant farmers, pawns in the turmoil of sixteenth century Japanese civil wars, are easily identified as precursors of the `Star Wars' droids, R2-D2 and C3PO.However, when all is said and done, the comparisons are only superficial. It may be more constructive to note some aspects of humor and character that are utilized in general. Kurosawa has always been willing to develop exaggerated characters. The peasant farmers, with their quick shifts between cowardice, bickering , and thievery are good examples of this. Certainly the first two of these traits were incorporated in the character of C3PO (the mechanical humanoid), but R2-D2 shows none of these characteristics. There is, however, an overall sense of humor that permeates both `The Hidden Fortress' and the `Star Wars' films-as well as a strong sense of nobility in the central characters, Rokurota and Skywalker.That said, `The Hidden Fortress' seems to me to have clearly been made by a superior filmmaker. Both are good at telling the story. The `Star Wars' films rely heavily on special effects, to the extent, I think, that these are the central features of the films. `The Hidden Fortress,' while a relatively light weight work for Kurosawa, involves much more subtle character development achieved by means of acting skill revealed through visual composition and unenhanced camera work.This was Kurosawa's first use of Tohoscope, a Japanese widescreen process. And he uses the screen frequently to develop character. Over and over again he uses the wide screen to develop and reveal character. The peasant farmers are certainly more complex than the droids, though they are simplistically exaggerated. Kurosawa chose to explore the situation of these piteous beings, buffeted about in the feudal wars of sixteenth century Japan, in visually reinforced  wide screen long shots in those final scenes on the plains.The code of the samurai is central to an understanding of `The Seven Samurai' (1954), `Yojimbo' (1961), and `Sanjuro' (1962), and even `Rashomon' (1954). These are all great films centered around the samurai class in Japan's past. From the ninth century, samurai warriors followed a strict code of ethical behavior known as `bushido,' which remained orally transmitted for generations. Briefly it is a way of life in which the warrior's honor and purpose are tied closely to the needs of his master. In this respect, he was to be selfless. His was not to understand or concern himself with politics-only to defend with honor the family or clan he served. For such a man the ideal was to be without fear-to always move forward in his employer's interest-without fear of death-only fear of dishonor. Toshiro Mifune's character in `The Hidden Fortress' is a military general, but his devotion to the creed and to his princess can be explained relative to this code. His daring, too, extends from that. So, too, his reputation reflects  that of an accomplished samurai. An especially strong scene in this regard is the duel scene in which Rokurota's skill and bravery are what are prized and respected by his opponent.Above all, The Hidden Fortress remains a great adventure permeated with humor and nobility. While the force in the `Star Wars' sense is never mentioned, it remains a tacit part of  Rokurota's nobility.",

            "content": "Here we have another great samurai epic from masterful Akira Kurosawa. This film is one of the many fantastic samurai films Kurosawa created in his hay-day. This one falls in line with the long stretch of these great films, and stands as just another great piece of art from Kurosawa. The one thing that does allow it to stand apart is it's being told from the perspective of two of the lesser characters. The story follows two thieves who, in the midst of a territory war, are searching for hidden gold. They meet up with a samurai general of one of the warring clans. They team up with this samurai (played by the always magnificent Toshiro Mifune) as he attempts to get his princess out of the dangerous territory and escort her to safety. However, the best part of this plot is that it is credited as being one of the major influences for George Lucas' Star Wars (1977). The two peasant thieves the plot follows are the basis for the characters of C-3PO and R2-D2. In fact, these two characters had a major influence on character archetypes and practically set the archetype for the goofy pair of friends we see time after time.The Hidden Fortress, overall, has a much lighter tone than some of Kurosawa's other films set in the same setting. While most of his films have that element of subtle dark humor, The Hidden Fortress could be considered a true comedy at times, mainly due to the shenanigans of the two oddball protagonists. But at it's core, The Hidden Fortress is a true action adventure film that has plenty of fun doing what it's doing. It has its darker moments, but it stays above the dark water for the majority of the film. It's plenty entertaining and the story never dwindles or drags. The two peasants are incredibly entertaining, and while they are more caricatures than anything else, they add so much to the film and are really what drive this film's lighter heart.This film might be lighter, but Kurosawa obviously doesn't skimp on the artistry for a second. He heavily employs the use of very long takes for this film, which has a great effect in unexpected places. Kurosawa artistically blends comic relief and more serious action in such a great way that it is easy to get lost in the film when looking at it as a whole. There is no shortage of immaculate action sequences that are as stylistically brilliant as they are awesome and entertaining to watch. There is one particular duel involving spears that stands out in my mind as a near perfect blend of being ridiculously cool, as well as beautiful to witness unfold. It's hard not to be at least mildly entertained by this exciting film.The Hidden Fortress doesn't quite reach to the same level of epic grandeur that some of Kurosawa's other samurai films do, but it fits right in with his collection of great films. No two Kurosawa films are quite the same so it is hard to say that any of his films don't stand out among the rest but if I had to choose one I'd say it was The Hidden Fortress. The highest point of this film would definitely be it's influence on not only Star Wars but the character archetype the two peasant friends fill. The Hidden Fortress is simply just another great film from an amazing director.",

It gets going with a couple of greedy foils, ala Laurel and Hardy, who the Mifune character eventually tolerates. He has bigger fish to fry, transporting a Princess who needs to get back to her people. I don't know what it was but she seemed so striking, so interesting, even as she ran around in her big baggy shorts. She is an actress of great emotional being. She is no slouch. Those two buffoons have designs on her. If they ever tried anything she would cut them in half. This is a film about loyalties and sacrifices. Mifune's character keeps his composure at all times. There is a wonderful fight scene when he faces a serious adversary. Eventually, honor comes into play. That's something I need to get used to in these films. There are some great scenes centering around gold that has been hidden in hollow sticks that are being transported by the main characters. Mifune's character is cool and calm and never pushes the envelope. As a nice little fantasy, this comes off quite well.",

            "content": "In an interview, Akira Kurosawa said that he made THE HIDDEN FORTRESS as a deliberate counterpart to the earlier, darker films of his career; he'd just come off the back of his MACBETH adaptation, THRONE OF BLOOD (and, let's face it, things don't get much darker) and he wanted to make a lighter piece of entertainment for a change. THE HIDDEN FORTRESS is certainly that: it's a humour-filled adventure filled with action and spectacle. It's also one of my less favourite Kurosawa movies.I like darkness. I like dark, violent movies that explore the depths of the human soul. Comedy has never really appealed me to me \u2013 my tastes in humour are very subjective \u2013 and this film has a lot of comedy. In fact, pretty much every scene featuring the two cowardly peasants is played for laughs, and their appeal quickly wears thin. I began looking forward to the (few) moments they weren't around, and dreading their return to the fray.Still, the rest of the story is a lot of fun. Toshiro Mifune enjoys himself in a lighter role for a change, and gets to take part in some for-the-time spectacular action scenes; his duel with a rival general is particularly engaging. The scene-stealer of the piece is Misa Uehara, playing a princess who disguises herself as a mute for much of the production. Uehara is exceptional when given the opportunity to throw off the shackles surrounding the roles usually given to women in historical dramas and an intriguing forerunner to the later femme fatales who would populate Japanese samurai cinema come the 1970s.The story, involving the transportation of some gold across enemy country, is solid, but the plot does take a great deal of time to get moving. I wasn't very involved for the exceptionally long-winded introduction, but things get a lot better in the second half, when the genuine threat of discovery and death adds suspense to keep things moving along nicely. THE HIDDEN FORTRESS may not be an example of Kurosawa at his most profound, but it's a fine example of the director at work in a different, non-serious genre for a change.",

The headstrong princess on the run also invites comparison to Princess Leia, though Lucas insists that that was only a coincidence.The story here takes shape after down on their luck peasants Tahei & Matakishi cross paths with a mysterious stranger. When they find that he knows about the gold that they've recently stumbled upon their greed leads them to join forces with him in hopes of a big payoff. Along the way they meet a supposedly mute woman who is actually the princess of the defeated Akizuki clan. They then set out to cross enemy lines with a princess and a load of gold in tow.The cast is uniformly solid with a few familiar faces from other Kurosawa films like \"Seven Samurai\". Minoru Chiaki & Kamatari Fujiwara play the parts of the peasants with relish and the legendary Toshir\u00f4 Mifune delivers a fine performance as the crafty General.

It has a lighter tone and is more accessible, though these facts aren't necessarily detractions from the film. In any case, you still get top-notch direction from Kurosawa which in this case is accompanied by a lively score from Masaru Sat\u00f4.While those interested in George Lucas's inspirations for \"Star Wars\" may get the most out of this film I think that it is a solid tale of adventure in its own right.

In fact there are only 2 fights that I can remember, but nevertheless they are fantastic.  The tension comes from whether or not our heroes will be captured by the villainous army.  And they come so close it makes your pulse rise and your heart beat faster. \nIn addition the John Ford-type cinemetography excentuating the landscape is beautiful.  As in all Kurosawa films, nature becomes a character in itself as important as the actors.  Probably the best part of the movie though is the honor that these warriors possess.  They are governed by codes of conduct that Americans haven't seen in YEARS.  It's a nice change to see two great generals fight to the death with the loser being spared.  And he gets angry about living!!!  I only wish there were more movies like this one.",

            "content": "\"Star Wars\" is frequently labeled as one of the most original, influential, and entertaining movies ever made. While it's undeniably influential and according to the general consensus of opinion, entertaining, it is not quite as original as a lot of people are led to believe. Creator George Lucas has stated many times that his epic 1977 space opera was inspired by many movies by masters such as John Ford and the Japanese director influenced by him, Akira Kurosawa. The most notable influence on \"Star Wars\" was Kurosawa's first widescreen movie, \"The Hidden Fortress.\" Looking at the two movies, there are many notable similarities. There's two warring parties (one supported by an evil empire, the other an underdog), a spitfire warrior princess, a brave general, and most importantly, two lesser characters unwillingly caught up in the mix and from whose perspective the story is told. The lesser characters - the inspiration for C-3PO and R2-D2 - are pair of deliberately comical peasants played with magnificence by Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara and a general - though not as old as Obi-Wan - is played by the great Toshiro Mifune. The princess, the weakest character in the movie ironically, is played by the obscure Japanese actress Misa Uehara, whose career in films did not blossom past 1960.\"The Hidden Fortress\" is, simply put, a lot of low-key fun from a high-key director, Akira Kurosawa. His first movie project in wide-screen is a simplistic adventure story and he tells it very well with a lot of energy and enthusiasm. This is not one of Kurosawa's greatest or for that matter most memorable pictures, but it is a lot of fun and it fills its speedy running time very well. The most commendable thing on Kurosawa's directing is that he realizes that he does not have the strongest script in terms of character development, so he spends the first part of the movie with those details and making the rest of the picture a fun, nonstop adventure with a lot of inventive plot twists and ideas. Kurosawa was one of the finest directors who ever lived and the highlight of the movie are the battle scenes, which though not always plausible, are never boring. Because this is a lighthearted adventure story, the violence is never too graphic but is not glorified, so younger audience members can easily endure the movie.Now, this is one of the more imperfect entries in Kurosawa's plethora of films. With the exceptions of the two greedy peasants, we don't really come to know or understand any of the characters. Misa Uehara does a good job, but the warrior princess does not have much personality or a human side to her. Toshiro Mifune is also great as always, but he's playing more or less the same hollering, iron-willed tough guy as always, but with a little less personality to him. Nor do we come to understand at all, any of the villains.But then again, there is nothing wrong - nothing at all wrong - with an adventure story that is meant to be nothing more or less than pure, lighthearted fun and that is what \"The Hidden Fortress\" is. Where it lacks in character development, it makes up for it lots of adventurous plot twists, imaginative sequences, effective moments of comedy, and a nonstop flow of energy. Is it one of Kurosawa's best films? No, but it is a heck of a lot of fun and cannot escape my recommendation.",

Okay so Lucas is a rip-off (a pretty good one though) but its free publicity nonetheless!Also, any comparison between the two is downright stupid because Star Wars is purely a Sci-Fi movie and Lucas' directing skill is ... well, rather abysmal (but not awful, American Graffiti is a great movie - so give this guy some merit). Don't get me wrong, I love Star Wars and I think Lucas is a brilliant storyteller. However, Kurosawa is in an entirely different class, and like other greats such as Hitchcock and Godard, he is incomparable. I would list him in the top 10 most influential film director of all time. He inspired and influenced other heavyweight directors such as Scorsese, Spielberg, Herzog, John Sturges (The Magnificent Seven). Oh, and yes ... Lucas too, for those of you who are hardcore Star Wars fans.",

Essentially one long, linear road movie.Starts off slowly and never seems to find even second gear. Every scene gets drawn out to the max. No real focus either, just a long winding walk of a movie.Making things worse is the presence of the two peasants. Incredibly irritating and silly characters, they are largely responsible for the movie feeling so lacking in substance.

As always it is superbly directed, and looks amazing especially in the once again epic scenery and use of CinemaScope. The music score is suitably lively(though my favourite score of any of Kurasawa's movies is still Ran), the script is literate and amusing and the story compels. The action sequences are beautifully choreographed and exciting and the comedy puts a smile on my face. The acting is just as accomplished as ever, with Toshiro Mifune giving yet another charismatic lead performance, and Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara match him just as effectively. Through his camera and directorial techniques you can see Kurasawa paying debt to John Ford's western, and you can also see with the galaxy far far away idea especially the major influence it had on Star Wars. The Hidden Fortress was said as well to be Kurasawa's own personal favourite of his work, and while not quite mine(Seven Samurai) I can definitely see why, and it is perhaps his most accessible(I have often seen Throne of Blood criticised for its dramatic structure and one-dimensional characters and I know people were deterred by the length of Seven Samurai).

They aren't even free for long as they are captured and forced to dig for treasure by their captors. Luckily they escape again and as they are sitting down to eat find a gold bar hidden in their firewood. The look for more but soon another man appears he tells them he is Rokurota Makabe, a famous general, but they don't believe him\u0085 they do however decide to go with him when he tells them he has the rest of the gold; unbeknownst to them the 'mute' accompanying the general is a princess wanted by the local warlord. They will have to avoid enemy forces and resist their own greed in they are to get back home with a share of the gold.This is another classic from director Akira Kurosawa which nicely mixes drama and comedy. The fact that the two main characters were driven by greed rather than any noble motivation made them funny as each attempt they made to get rich by double-crossing each other and the others in their party was doomed to failure; Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara do fine jobs in these roles. Equally good is Toshir\u00f4 Mifune who plays the general; a more serious character but still able to provide a few laughs as well as some action. Misa Uehara is likable as the tomboyish Princess Yuki; a good strong female character. The story flows nicely and doesn't seem overly long despite being well over two hours long. If you are a fan of Kurosawa's other works or Japanese cinema in general this is a must see.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.",

            "content": "The hidden fortress starts with it's two main characters Tahei and Matakashi (played by Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara) walking through a war torn country side. They have just escaped from an internment camp after a recent great battle. The two had been forced to dig graves as prisoners and they are already, at the start of the movie, at wit's end. They soon become frustrated with each other and their situation that they set out in opposite directions, only to be both recaptured shortly thereafter. After a prisoner mass uprising and subsequent exodus, the two find themselves completely unscathed but monumentally stunned amongst the dozens of dead.. and piles of pillaged gold.Unable to carry much in their escape, their sense of scheming is palpable and a testament to the quality of direction. While walking through the woods they come upon a camping warlord, General Makabe (played by Kurosawa mainstay, Toshiro Mifune), who they enlist to help them steal the gold. Makabe has other ideas. They later meet up with the fiercely sexy Princess Yukihime (Misa Uehara) who playfully defends herself from the two anti-heroes, smacking all insolent fools with a reed and secretly running the show. The two rogues suffer through constant harassment with wide eyed fear and cowardice that Kurosawa somehow makes endearing.It was said that Kurosawa would spend the mornings of the writing process thinking up impossible situations for the two rogue protagonists and the production crew would have the afternoon to plot out how the two would escape from certain death; The pair survive numerous captures, a prison riot, multiple rock slides (!) and more often than not each other during a sometimes cathartic, sometimes hilarious series of events. The Hidden Fortress is an archetypal dark comedy and could be well adapted in the future because of it's intelligent dynamics and carefree yet succinct episodes (the first Star Wars employs much of the same wide open sense of adventure).While being one of the lightest of Kurosawa's films, it still has the underlying fatalism and rebelliousness that is inherent of much of interesting Japanese cinema. For examples, see much of mainstream (and probably most non mainstream) anime, as well as the nihilistic cult films of today like the recently Americanized Ringu (The Ring) and Kyua (Cure) by Kiyoshi Kurosawa (no relation).

The visual magic of Kurosawa's best films is present throughout. We have Toshiro Mifune playing a very powerful Samurai General and even engaging in one very realistic samurai duel.Throughout this movie, a film about two ne'er-do-goods seeking a treasure of gold and the princess they are forced to escort and protect, I was reminded of Sergio Leone. I was especially reminded of his best western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Certainly this film must have been admired by Sergio Leone because we do see a lot of visual influences in his films, coupled with the humor and lack of scruples in central characters.This is admittedly a fairytale, but a superbly told one with some amazing scenes and photography. Mifune stands like a titan in every scene that he is present. The only problems were probably the excessive length - at least 20 minutes could have been cut from the movie, and the ridiculous dress-code and voice of the actress playing Princess Yuki.

Along the way, they meet up with a very dedicated samurai (Toshiro Mifune) that enlists them against their will to help him in his task to protect his lady. The two \"heroes\" are hardly excited about the prospect but are taken against their wills into Mufune's confidence because apparently there really is no one else left to help! These two guys appear to be the inspiration for R2D2 and C3PO, believe it or not, and Mifune is sort of like a lone \"Jedi\" trying to save the lady who turns out to be a princess---sure sounds familiar does't it?!

Her piercing eyes and forceful words are the perfect counterpart to Mifune.The two peasants are interesting as comic relief and as a satire of human weaknesses like selfishness and greed (shades of Treasure of the Sierra Madre), though I thought they probably should have been used a little more sparingly. On the other hand, even though this film feels lighter than a lot of his other efforts, Kurosawa sprinkles in some darkness in this song first heard while the locals celebrate an annual bonfire: \"The life of a man - burn it in the fire. The life of an insect - throw it into the fire. When you realize the world is dark, life is just a dream - lose yourself.\" It's all great stuff, and pretty cool to see the influence it had on George Lucas.",

This film is probably best known for being a huge influence on STAR WARS but the movie deserve more attention than just that. The mixture of comedy and adventure is perfectly brought together by director Kurosawa and I must admit that I really didn't expect this type of film from him. I read that he was repaying Toho by doing this more mainstream film to show his appreciation for letting him do more risky projects. If so this is certainly right up his alley and he makes the material all his own. What I enjoyed most were the performances, which are downright masterful from beginning to end. The comic bantering between Chiaki and Fujiwara was downright hysterical and their chemistry jumped right off the screen from the time they walked on. The opening argument between the two is very funny and perfectly sets up everything that's going to follow. Mifune delivers yet another great performance and Uehara is also very good in her role. The four of them together really work well and deliver everything they should. Another wonderful thing was the cinematography, which mixed with the direction, makes for some great atmosphere.

Admittedly, he is wearing micro hot pants and a cleavage-baring Ming the Merciless vest, but it's not the male version of the Jodie-Foster-in-Taxi-Driver outfit that gets me juiced up. He just has a commanding physical presence that shines through. You can see that quality in other films, such as the scene of him walking away at the end of Yojimbo (and what's up with Kurosawa and actors walking away from the camera?) Maybe it's the comparison with his Abbot and Costello sidekicks, but he has never been hotter. The other notable thing about this film is the scenery. Who knew that Japan had an Outback? And who knew that a life-or-death scrabble up a loose scree slope could be so funny? Kurosawa films contain many anguished cries, but never this many girlie screams. Many reviewers seem to think that this is Kurosawa's big foray into comedy, but Yojimbo and Sanjuro, for example, are quite funny. Even Shichinin no Samurai is, at its heart, a film about how bad millet tastes. But maybe you only get the joke if you've eaten millet.",

Kurosawa still maintains stringent control over the technical aspects, executing them with finesse to deliver a spectacle that aptly balances action, drama & comedy.The film also marks Kurosawa's first stint with the widescreen format which provides this period epic its sweeping grandeur but it is the small details & episodic moments that leave a larger footprint. Toshiro Mifune is brash & brawny as expected but he is often matched by Misa Uehara's fiery performance, while Minoru Chiaki & Kamatari Fujiwara are brilliant together in their comic relief roles.Overall, The Hidden Fortress is a competently crafted & confidently directed period piece that promises a ride full of action, adventure, humour & thrills, and delivers it in sufficient doses.

Tahei and Matashichi are two selfish greedy peasants just trying to get home. After discovering gold in the mountains, the two decide to team up with a general and a princess hiding out there in order to escape with some extra money in their pockets. \"The Hidden Fortress\" is an adventure story that draws influence from both Eastern and Western cultures. Instead of being seen from the high-class samurai's eyes, the majority of the film is done through the two peasant's perspectives which generally balances between seriousness and humor relatively well. It does get slightly over-the-top at points but with a witty cast and a fantastic director like Akira Kurosawa, it's not hard to see why George Lucas would eventually draw inspiration from it for \"Star Wars.\"",

I'm glad--it's mine, too.He's one of our greatest directors, up there with Kubrick, John Huston, John Ford, Satyajit Ray, and D.W. Griffith.  His style is as inimitable as it is powerful and unique.And \"The Hidden Fortress\" is his best picture.  I'll long remember one image in particular:  the two thieves (who would eventually be seen again as R2-D2 and C-3PO) climbing up a rock wall, as the rocks sink beneath them.  The camera frames only two things:  the thieves, and the rocks sifting.  It's simple, but quite striking nonetheless.When all is said and done, it's really just a straight-forward, wholesome action picture, and great fun.  Most peoples' first experience with Kurosawa is usually with \"The Seven Samurai\" or \"Rashomon\", or \"Ran\".  All three are outstanding motion pictures, but I felt like I found \"The Hidden Fortress\" for myself.  To weigh artistic and technical merits would be futile and boring, for me and for you.",

            "content": "Call him an artist, an auteur, a great filmmaker, or whatever, Akira Kurosawa can make some very fun movies. But what sets this movie apart from his others is just about how fun it can be.The first thing to note is that Toshiro Mifune plays a much different role than his normal bantering in Kurosawa's other movies. Mifune is one of those actors that graces subtleties in similarities and can make all sorts of roles out of recognizable movements, but in this film he's just completely different; in fact, if it wasn't for his character's ultimate intelligence, he'd be foil opposite.So that's very neat to watch, but another thing is the story. This is one of those movies where you think you know exactly where it's going, but it tends to surprise you at various moments. I couldn't honestly say I knew how this would end by the time I was midway through. Even Mifune's immortality doesn't seem to be any guarantee, and everything is very gripping. By the end of this movie I was almost exhausted by how much I had gone through.However, it's not difficult to watch or anything. It really does relate to Star Wars, in that it seems an acute telling of the struggle of inherent goodness that eventually, through better or for worse, ends up defying evil despite how little chance it seems to have. Then again, I wouldn't call greed inherent goodness, but even the hopes and dreams of two bungling peasants has something to say about the common drive in many people to just succeed, and what following that drive can be.It's a very satisfying peace of cinema.--PolarisDiB",

            "content": "In medieval Japan, two lowly soldiers are trying to make their way back home when by chance they discover some gold hidden in a stick. When they meet a mysterious stranger who claims to know where there is more, their greed begins to cloud their judgement ...If you're not familiar with the works of the great Japanese director Kurosawa, this is a good movie to start with. Thematically it's much lighter than usual, it's pretty much a non-stop adventure story and it has a happy ending. Overall it's just a good romp; there's hidden treasure, a mysterious general, a princess pretending to be a dumb mute, lots of fights, two prison breakouts and plenty of humour and intrigue. It's also a great example of Kurosawa's style - when watching see if you can spot any conventional TV/Hollywood full-face closeups, because I can't. Instead, almost every scene is shot with long lenses to emphasise backgrounds and the actors are carefully placed and moved within the frame. It's a brilliantly different way to tell stories which results in much more of a visual sweep and reduces the need to cut, and influenced many key directors, particularly Kubrick and Coppola. If possible, try to see the British Film Institute DVD release of this, which is in the original Tohoscope 2.55:1 ratio, and looks stunning, such as in the duel with the lances, or Kurosawa's fondness for scenes featuring mist, wind or rain. The story is good fun throughout, with plenty of surprises, comic interludes and a satisfying conclusion. All the cast get into the spirit of it, with Mifune giving perhaps his most relaxed, laid-back performance of the sixteen films he made with the great director. Trivia - many have noted similarities between this film and Star Wars. It can be read as Tahei and Matashichi are C-3PO and R2-D2 (two grumpy bickering friends whom the action largely passes by), Makabe is Obi-Wan Kenobi (a faithful old retainer trying to save his dynasty), Tadokoro is Darth Vader (a scar-faced villain and Makabe's nemesis) and the Princess is, er, the Princess. George Lucas notes that perhaps the key influence is in the method of telling the story from an unconventional point of view, but the connections are all fun to debate. A great rollicking adventure flick. English title - The Hidden Fortress.",

            "content": "Those film viewers who equate foreign films with pretense need to sit down for a couple of hours and watch director Akira Kurosawa's first widescreen (Tohoscope) film, the black and white The Hidden Fortress (Kakushi-Toride No San-Akunin- literally The Three Villains Of The Hidden Fortress), from 1958. While it is a very good film, it is a great movie- in the feel good sense of the term. Filmmaker George Lucas claims this film was the inspiration for his third rate Star Wars films. Yes, there are a handful of similarities, but 'influence' is usually used when a great work of art is influenced by an equal or lesser work of art, not when bad art rips off greater art. In short, influence occurs in evolution, not devolution, and Lucas's claims bear the stench of a lesser artist trying to parasitically sponge off a greater artist's reputation.The Hidden Fortress runs 139 minutes, but it never slows down nor gets boring. It is action and humor nonstop, and Kurosawa reputedly only made the film to repay Toho Studios for allowing him to make riskier, more artistic films like Ikiru and Rashomon. In many ways, even though the film stars the great Toshir\u00f4 Mifune, as General Rokurota Makabe, a role that is quite reserved in comparison to his other roles in period films- or jidai-geki (from where Lucas got the term Jedi), the film's narrative and heart belong to the two peasant farmer fools, tubby Tahei (Minoru Chiaki- the good natured samurai from Seven Samurai) and tiny Matakishi (Kamatari Fujiwara- the farmer Manzo from Seven Samurai), who make a terrific comedy team- far better than their supposed Star Wars stand-ins, R2D2 and C3PO. This duo not only get the most screen time, but the tale is basically from their point of view, and the viewer roots for them, despite their greed and stupidity constantly endangering them; whereas the more conventional tale of the Princess and her General is backgrounded and rather rote\u0085. Fortunately, the occasional anachronism is about the only thing wrong with the tale, for The Hidden Fortress is a great adventure movie, as well as very funny. That said, I can state with the utmost seriousness that I know Akira Kurosawa. Akira Kurosawa is a friend of mine. And you, Mr. Lucas, are no Akira Kurosawa. Now, if only Tahei and Matakishi were around to beat him, as he so richly deserves.",

            "content": "According to film lore, director Akira Kurosawa (1910-1998) wished to make a distinctly commercial film for Toho Studios in order to thank the company for backing his earlier, riskier fare. Considering that the fare in question, however, had generated several major international hits, it would seem the studio had been already been thanked and then some. No, I suspect that this story was put forth by Kurosawa fans who wanted to find a tangible reason for the fact that THE HIDDEN FORTRESS was not quite in the same league as such films RASHOMON, SEVEN SAMURAI, and THRONE OF BLOOD. If so, they needn't have bothered. It is true that THE HIDDEN FORTRESS lacks the same intense focus and the same visual power as Kurosawa's masterworks, but it is no less a fine film for that, and it should be judged on its own merits.The story begins with two foolish peasants Tahei (Minoru Chiaki) and Matashichi (Kamatari Fujiwara) who squandered their savings to go to war--only to find themselves beset by both armies. Having at last escaped, they discover a piece of gold belonging to the defeated army, begin to search for more, and fall into the hands of General Rokurota Makabe (Toshiro Mifune), who seeks to get both the gold and the only surviving ruler of his clan, Princess Yuki (Misa Uehara), out enemy territory. Makabe decides he can make use of the peasants--and quite soon the party is underway, the gold cleverly concealed, the peasants really more hindrance than help, and the Princess every bit as strong willed as her general.As you might expect from Kurosawa, THE HIDDEN FORTRESS is a highly visual film, and indeed it contains sequences every bit as exciting as the best of his best. The opening shots, which track the peasants across what seems to be a completely empty landscape that is suddenly disrupted by sudden death; the rebellion of the prisoners in the camp; the moments in which Princess Yuki explores a brothel; the fire dance--all offer Kurosawa's meticulous eye at its most penetrating. The performances are excellent and the whole thing is extremely entertaining.Most critical complaints about the film center on Chiaki and Fujiwara's performances as the peasants, and it is quite true that--to Western eyes at least--they seem excessive, almost as if two of the Three Stooges had been suddenly dropped into a Eugene O'Neill drama. Ideas about comedy vary considerably from culture to culture, and this may be an instance in which we should chalk up the experience to evidence of that; even so, and although I found them occasionally wearing, they frequently manage to transcend the cultural barrier to become laugh-out-loud funny.The Criterion DVD release is quite fine in terms of sound and picture and offers extremely legible subtitles. The only \"bonus feature\" is an eight minute interview with George Lucas, who briefly discusses the influence of Kurosawa in general and THE HIDDEN FORTRESS in particular on his film STAR WARS. The best I can say for the clip is that it has obviously been quite some time since Lucas saw THE HIDDEN FORTRESS; he seems oblivious to many of the parallels. That said, quite frankly I find the comparison somewhat overblown. THE HIDDEN FORTRESS does well enough on its own.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",

I have seen High and Low (1963), which is one of his modern day dramas, but for the most part, I have only seen his samurai dramas. So, after watching this film back-to-back, twice, which is my first time seeing it, but twice, it was a refreshing spin away from Kurosawa's usual (but great), samurai dramas. What struck me the most is how funny this film is. Kurosawa ventures a little bit into the comedy genre, by introducing us to two of the most pathetic, selfish, greedy characters ever, but still manages to make these guys worthy of our pity. Despite how sad these two guys are, we still feel sorry for them.Tahei (Minoru Chiaki, who I know from Godzilla Raids Again (1955) and Matashichi (Kamatari Fujiwara), are two, broke peasants trying to get back home, with as much money as they can find. They have high aspirations, but the journey is ripe with peril. Three competing territories, with guarded borders, is what they need to go through to get home. After crossing the first border, they eventually stumble across a piece of gold wedged into a stick. Their claim is short lived when the first claimer, General Rokurota Makabe (Toshiro Mifune), tries to make a deal and a pact with Tahei and Matashichi, as they try to make a run for the next border with all the gold. Unknown to them, the mute, young peasant girl, that General Makabe has to bring along with them, to the next territory, is the Princess Yuki (Misa Uehara).The performances by the cast are some of the best I have seen in a Kurosawa film. Legendary Japanese actor, Takashi Shimura (Seven Samurai (1954), Gojira (1954), has a small role as the Old General Nagakura, a father-figure to Yuki. Of course, the film has its dramatic moments, that make it a Kurosawa film. There also is plenty of samurai action, horse chases and 16th century sword fighting flare. There also is the comedy that I mentioned. I actually laughed out loud.What really makes this an extremely good film is the work of Kurosawa. He gets everything he can out of his actors in order to make a successful scene. His camera style is unparalleled. His ability to use shapes and figures to frame a shot are beautiful with every shot. He manages to use the landscape as a way to frame everything. It is like watching poetry in motion. He truly was a master of the black and white film. It is breath-taking to watch this film unfold.9.1 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",

While neither of the two is particularly likeable, they offer some great fun. The general (Toshiro Mifune) has immense screen presence and plays his role in a convincingly understated manner.

The foreground-to-background compositional depth is *almost* fully integrated with this.The joke, of course, is the telling of the story from the peasant thieves' point of view, which lies at the most contemptibly low level.

The story though was hard to get and the characters (unsually for Kurosawa) rather stereo-types than human beings. Especially the stupid and greedy peasants got on my nerves after a while, acting like clown-children all the time, without any character development. Mifune is great as incarnation of manliness though, and the androgyn princess is also an interesting figure, kind of Japanese styled hunt goddess Diana, sweet and small on the one hand, rude and imperious on the other. Could have been a great movie, since it has everything Kurosawa usually needs to develop his great psychological character studies... I missed something like the great monologue of Mifune in the Seven Samurai, where he is first mocking the farmers for their ridiculousness, but then turning his speech into a stirring accusation against the class of the Samurai, that suppressed the formerly free farmers and made them what they are, small, weak and afraid all the time....Hidden Fortres instead, with its all time noble, strong and good Mifune as opposed to the all time greedy, weak and unloyal farmers seems to give rather a reason for mastery of the one over the other, since it does not try to explain its characters.As key scene however, the fire dance with its song (a man's life goes with the fire/a worm's life drops into the flames)is so electrifying and has such a tense atmosphere, that it alone compensates for the rather conservative plot development....",

Two bumbling, hilariously-sketched peasants contrast with the dignity of a Princess and a General. I cannot believe how amazingly beautiful and memorable some of the scenes are! Mifune, galloping on horseback after the officials, with his arms raised, and his sword perpendicular to the saddle...his body unmoving, not a budge...and the horse beneath him is galloping, exploding in movement..racing full-tilt....the trees and bush in the background a blur, the horse's movements a blur, but Mifune is like a still shot in the midst of this speed...Kurasawa cuts and pans the scene. And, Mifune, solid, fierce, intent to kill ...that raised sword of vengeance. Wow. Blows me away. Then, good old Minoru Chiaki, (one of the most lovable character actors in film) when he is so defeated by all the ill-fortune, sleeping on the ground, he wakes up and is crying to his buddy, \"Let's be friends forever.\" I actually laugh out loud. Characterization in a distilled form: When Mifune laughs as he enters the secret passage in the mountains surrounding the hidden fortress, he is such an heroic figure, he's almost frightening. When he tells of his sister's sacrifice...he is humble, and in pain, but careful not to show it. How can a guy communicate so much?It's really quite funny when Mifune, after murdering the two horsemen rides directly into the midst of the opposing army's camp! Like...hello! But, then, the verbal exchange between Mifune and his opponent is so surprising and cool. The spear fight is my least favorite fight of all Mifune's battles. But, I love the ending of the fight, where he jumps on his horse and smiles as he leaves. The film is an absolute pleasure to watch, and worth viewing many times, for the landscapes, variety of scene settings, humor, compassion, and for thrill of it. Influential on American cinema? Sure, but that's not why this film is so much fun. It's Kurosawa giving us a scene \"grand-as-any David Lean production\" in the mass uprising of the peasants, it's the contrast of chalky white landscape with lush vegetation and a cool spring, it's the two peasants who entertain, it's Mifune at the top of his game, it's an entertaining story told brilliantly.",

All you Star Wars fans need to watch this (and The Searchers) to see where George Lucas stole (uh, I mean borrowed, yeah...) his ideas.  C3PO, R2D2, Princess Leia, Han Solo, the Empire, it's all here (Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader are in The Searchers).This movie is probably the best use of 2.35:1 photography I've ever seen, and a director has to be extra good for me to like that wide of a ratio. Watch the scene when the our two peasants are complaining about digging a pit, the camera follows them perfectly as they walk on either side.  Or the scene when they get lost in a crowd and spot eachother.  Not once does Kurosawa seem to be using the wide ratio to impress us or create an artificial sense of grandeur.I recommend the Criterion DVD, the picture is very sharp and the contrast is perfect (I've never seen this theatrically, so I can't vouch for its accuracy, but it looks good).",

Fortress is a perfect example of what Kurosawa is capable of; choosing to make a film with a very simple but interesting plot, and including into it many different Kurosawian elements which make the film absolutely unforgettable. In this film you will find, Kurosawa's funniest piece, his honest and realistic depiction of violence, his amazingly thorough characters, his terrific sets, and of course, his masterful craft. Fortress was the influence for George Lucas' Star War trilogy; R2-D2 and C3PO were the inspiration for the two greedy farmers Tahei and Matakishi. Also, the hyper bike sequence in Jedi closely resembles the horse chase sequence in Fortress. Kurosawa's 1958 epic stands alone by itself, and captures the true essence of filmmaking.",

And who thus get what you have, then see how it is elusive happiness. For a specific reason: to get rich because he forgot the others, those who also had to win to that justice be carried out. For without justice there is no real conquest, and any achievements in the others lose, be fatuous and vain. Matakishi and Tahei are two scoundrels fleeing now looking like tramps. They are still very close to the dreaded hidden fortress... and are taken prisoner. But destiny is on their side, and after a terrible slaughter that resembles that of the stairs of Odessa, (a Kurosawa's nod to Sergei Eisenstein), we see then, by the rugged mountains and found gold crests, and then, a stern man who introduces himself as Rokurota Makabe, who promises a lot of gold in exchange for help. Is this an adventure to the Robin Hood. Mission: save to the princess Yukihime, who is now searched every corner with the intention of removing it. Beautiful and full of character, besides the treasure that she represents, another treasure must be carried with her in order to reset the kingdom. And this is the object upon which the pair of greedy, and very silly, assistant road. The comedic tone is imposed them with their foolish strategies to get their way, while caring for the princess Makabe to that, \"for some strange reasons\", pretending to be mute. There are funny moments, an occasional brilliance in the staging and beautiful music and awesome exhaust. There is also place for an occasional exercise of dignity... and the temptation is still there, repeatedly, that Matakishi and Tahei may have new opportunities to choose between friendship, dignity, service to the empire... or gold. Despite the Silver Bear in Berlin found, this is just a friendly and attractive adventure to spare him some footage and I feel that too much prominence was given to greedy fools, sacrificing with this, necessary and sometimes preferable, to further the general relationship with the lovely - but sturdy - princess. Toshiro Mifune once again adjusted to his role as hero, and Misa Uehara, a successful debut as Princess Yukihime. A new, very young Misa Uehara wins on celluloid and now appears in such titles as \"Ju-on\".

            "content": "A single swordfight was enough for Akira Kurosawa to build a groundbreaking narrative device, the movie was \"Rashomon\" and even within the technical limitations of a director who wasn't a name yet, the art of storytelling was changed forever.A chronological leap toward the 80s: Kurosawa's magnificent bravura and unequalled instinct for epic battles is fully demonstrated in masterpieces in color: Golden Palm winner \"Kagemusha\" and of course, \"Ran\". After that, Kurosawa would make more contemplative movies at the twilight of his rich and so incomparable career. Now, how do you go from the choreographic duels of \"Rashomon\" to the large-scaled extravaganza of \"Ran\"?My guess is that the artistic vision remains the same, all you've got to do is either change the perspective, the \"Rashomon\" way or to enlarge the scope, and that's \"The Hidden Fortress\" way. Indeed, the film marks a pivotal moment in his work with the revolutionary use of Cinemascope (Tohoscope) that allowed Kurosawa to transcend the geographical and optical limitations of the camera, and through vast panoramic shots of landscapes and crowds, give the film its epic texture.And long before \"Yojimbo\", Kurosawa will also be a source of inspiration for Sergio Leone, in his use of a screen like a framed entity, the ironic outcome being that the characters never see what the camera doesn't see itself. You've got to hand it to Kurosawa to challenge the rules of practicality for the sake of thrills or jump scares. Take for instance the opening of \"The Hidden Fortress\" where the two disheveled Matashishi (Kamatara Fujiwara) and Tahei (Minoru Chiaki) drift across a no man's land.The big guy and the little guy are having an argument as full of expositional information as hilarious one-liners, they might loathe each other because they know they deserve each other. While we're following them as if we were right next to Kurosawa's cameraman, we see them turning their horrified heads. Then an agonizing soldier pops us immediately followed by horsemen. The ensuing violence is so startling that we don't have time to realize the duo should have heard them coming. Later, when they attempt to steal the gold and escape from from Rokurota (Toshiro Mifune) and Princess Yuki (Misa Uehara), they only notice them when they turn their heads again, finding them in a spot they had just passed through. This time, the same device works for comical effect.But \"The Hidden Fortress\" isn't an exercise in style, the merit of Kurosawa is to handle the novelty of the Scope to emphasize the movement, and the film allows us appreciate the gusto Kurosawa demonstrates in scenes that used to be impossible. Think about it, how can you film a speeding horse, it's not just about filming speed but action in speed, the long travelling shot on Mifune galloping with a sabre on his hand as he was chasing two guards of the Yanama clan is perhaps a moment that would have made John Ford proud because it also reinvents the horse chase. The horse doesn't gallop across Monument Valley, a deserted area that would ease the use of travelling cams, it's across a forest and the Samurai is also supposed to neutralize the enemy and take his horse, there's action within the chase so the difficulty is doubled and prove Kurosawa's mastery of movement in one epic travelling shot.A word about horses. Kurosawa adored horses and when the young man saw galloping horses' manes waving in the air and smokes of dust flying off the ground, he thought there was so much beauty and poetry that cinema couldn't ignore it, I guess he probably loved \"Stagecoach\" and in many aspects, the film resembles the classic Western in the way it features different protagonists and personalities in a long journey toward a specific destination. \"Seven Samurai\" had valuable warriors and became a landmark of modern action picture, \"The Hidden Fortress\", while not being a staple of cinema's history, did have an effect one wouldn't have anticipated, indirectly.Yes, Kurosawa is quite the center of the cinematic universe, modernizing Western after having been a Western aficionado, he inspired as well as he was inspired (one of his battle scenes is a nod to the Odessa steps), he changed narratives, created modern cinema and finally gave a little boost in the creativity of a certain George Lucas. So it's fun to spot the similarities: the two peasants and droids C3PO and R2D2, it's even better when the film opens with one shot that immediately reminds of their desert scene, Yuki, who looks so bad-ass even by our own standards makes Princess Leia looks like a Disney Princess. The forest chase in \"Jedi\" is a clear nod to the horse sequence... but \"The Hidden Fortress\" should also be revered for it own entertaining value.Yes, it's an action picture after two dark movies (\"Live in Fear\" and \"Throne of Blood\") but it's not a mindless one. Every sequence contributes to a memorable moment (the climbing on the rocky slope, the bonfire) or is handled with ingenuous audacity like the way they pass the enemy checkpoint with a load of gold bars hidden in branches. And sometimes, even the cowardice of the duo isn't just played for laughs and inspires the whole mission, the rest is a spellbinding adventure story involving duels, fight, regal solemnity and sleazy comedy.Speaking of comedy, calling Maashishi and Hati comic reliefs is almost an understatement or an insult, the film is shown through their despicable perspective, they're greedy, weak, even abject and yet they serve as the perfect contrast to Mifune's strong nobility and to the princess' courage. Without these two, I doubt \"The Hidden Fortress\" would have had the same impact. Must be like imagining \"Star Wars\" without the droids. Now, the film isn't probably in the Top 5 masterpiece but even when he's experimenting and making movies for fun, the Sensei remains an influence. And how!",

This one is unusual in that the emphasis is on comedy - its a dramatic 'escape from behind enemy lines' yarn, the difference being that we see it through the eyes of two cowardly and stupid farmers, both reluctant assistants to the real hero, inevitably portrayed by Toshiro Mifune.It may seem much lighter than Kurosawa's more famous masterpieces, but its not a slight movie. In so many of his movies the underlying theme is that underneath heroism there are numerous motivations, many of them base - and often these baser motivations are no more creditable than conventional notions of nobility. One of the many reasons for his greatness as a director was his ability to maintain a consistent humanist viewpoint, even while entertaining his audience.And yes, the movie is constantly entertaining, with great action sequences. Only the ending is a minor let down. Misa Uehara is a great heroine - its a wonder why she never became a big star.This movie does, however, give a clear reason why it is fashionable in certain cineaste circles now to be disparaging to Kurasawa when assessing him in relation to his contemporaries such as Ozu and Naruse.

            "content": "The Hidden Fortress is an entertaining adventure film and rightfully regarded as one of Kurosawa Akira's greatest and most influential movies. The story follows two naive peasants who try to find gold during a war between the victorious Yamada clan and the defeated Akizuki clan. Instead of getting rich and famous, they end up getting caught on multiple occasions and are forced to do degrading labours. Their luck finally seems to turn when they find a piece of gold in a wooden stick in an isolated valley. This piece of gold belongs to the defeated Akizuki clan and their surviving general initially plans to kill the foolish peasants. When he learns of their plan to go back to their home province by passing by a third province in order to avoid the heavily guarded border, the general finds this idea so brilliant that he decides to test the peasants. He leads them into the clan's hidden fortress, promises them more gold and asks them to help him bring the riches to their home province which is allied with the Akizuki clan. What the general doesn't tell them is that the mute girl who travels with them is actually the princess of the Akizuki clan who needs to be brought to safety. The quartet's identity is soon compromised on their epic journey and the four characters need to fight for their own survival, the gold and the fate of the Akizuki clan.By Kurosawa's standards, The Hidden Fortress is a surprisingly fast-paced film. In the first half hour alone, we witness how the two peasants get separated during an argument, end up being caught by the Yamada clan, have to do hard physical labour, get mixed up in an uprising of prisoners of war, flee to a secluded valley, find some gold and meet the mysterious general. There are more things happening in the first quarter of this movie than in entire other films of the same genre. The Hidden Fortress is particularly entertaining from start to finish.The characters are also particularly vivid. The story is told by the two stupid, naive and dishonest peasants which adds an entertaining, humorous and light-hearted touch to the film. The mysterious general is brilliantly played by Mifune Toshiro who seemed to get better with each film he made with Kurosawa. Uehara Misa convinces in her first role as independent princess and incarnates a physically and mentally strong woman who avoids any stereotypes.The landscapes also add a lot to this epic movie. The quartet travels through rocky mountains, heavily guarded borders and ancestral villages. They sleep in crowded inns and wet caves. They fight enemy soldiers and join local peasants for a fire festival. The movie tells us a lot about Japanese culture and traditions.There are only two minor reasons why the film didn't get the perfect grade. First of all, the story is rather simplistic and could have been a little bit more surprising. Secondly, the cinematography is equally simple. It's not the director who stands out here but the brilliant actresses and actors.If you like adventure and action movies and are interested in Japanese culture, you should definitely watch The Hidden Fortress. The film has aged rather well and is still entertaining nowadays. The journey portrayed in this movie is so epic that it requests multiple viewings.",

            "review_title": "Nowhere near Kurosawa's best actioner, despite Mifune's fine job",
            "content": "Frankly, I'm baffled by other reviewers who have given \"Hidden Fortress\" such high praise.  As a long-time fan of Kurosawa, I do not believe that \"Hidden Fortress\" should even be mentioned in the same breath as \"The Seven Samurai\", \"Throne of Blood\" or \"Yojimbo\".  Indeed, other than Mifune's stalwart performance, there is little beyond the cinematography to reveal this as a Kurosawa film at all.  The film's structure is not the trouble; it is a fairly standard action plot revolving around warring clans and defeated soldiers trying to make their way out of enemy territory.  As mentioned, the look of the film is typically Kurosawan, with dramatic settings, adventurous camera angles and dramatic vistas.  No, the problems with \"Hidden Fortress\" are with the supporting characters and the plot devices.  That, and the fact that it is at least 30 minutes too long.First, the characters.  Ostensibly, the film's main characters are not Mifune, but Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara, playing a couple of ignoble peasants who sold their homes to buy weapons and went to war to make their fortunes.  Now defeated, they are trying to make their way home, while endlessly bickering with each other.  For a parallel with their performances, look no further than Lou Costello (of Abbott & Costello) and Curly from the Three Stooges.  Witless, shrieking when excited or afraid, and as broadly played as would fit on the screen.  The other irritant is the character of the princess, who is played with mind-numbing amplitude by Misa Uehara.  She seems unable to deliver a line of dialog with any subtlety or grace, instead preferring to stomp and flounce, shouting her lines, like an amateur Katherine Hepburn, \"turned up to 11\".  It is perhaps of little surprise that her acting career spanned just three years.The other main problem is in the plot devices. >>MINOR SPOILER ALERT<< I lost count of how many times the \"good guys\" led by Toshiro Mifune, escaped from impossible situations.  The most egregious were when they were pursued in the forest by the enemy soldiers.  Each of the men were supposedly carrying 200 to 300 pounds of gold on their backs, over mountainous terrain, but they were able to escape from soldiers just a few hundred feet behind them.  Despite the hundreds of shots fired at them at close range, and bullets splintering the trees all around them, none of the main party were shot.  That brings up another point: this is set during the Muromachi period, when the state of the art in weaponry were smooth-bore flintlock muskets, which took at least a few minutes to reload, yet the volleys come thick and fast from relatively few soldiers, and with amazing accuracy and range (although not accurate enough to hit any of the 4 main characters!)  Also, the princess could not stand out more from her surroundings if she were painted pink.  With her bizarrely shaped eyebrows, short-shorts and skimpy shirt, she hardly was likely to blend into the crowd as they tried to make their way incognito across enemy territory.  Why not put her in a hat and peasant's clothing?  As for the supposed \"Star Wars\" connection--I find it tenuous at best.  The stupid, greedy and untrustworthy pair of sidekicks little resemble R2-D2 or C-3PO, whose worst flaws were fear and occasional distrust.  None of the other three main male characters resemble the three male leads from the original \"Star Wars\" film.  A far more accurate comparison would be between Hidden Fortress and Hayao Miyazaki's \"Mononoke-Hime\", whose princess seems to have been lifted directly from \"Hidden Fortress\".  Kurosawa made so many great films, it is a shame to see so much unworthy praise heaped on a film that--lacking Mifune's presence and Kurosawa's name, would be regarded as a generic adventure flick.",

I think I would have enjoyed it better if the characters of Matashichi and Tahei weren't so desperately futile in their performances. I kept wondering when Rokurota was going to cut them loose as they always seemed to endanger the mission in some way. The trio didn't seem to share a particularly good chemistry together, and if it were me, I would have ditched them right after the first act.I did like the character of Rokurota Makabe as portrayed by Toshiro Mifune. He managed to maintain a regal bearing throughout the picture, even if he had to constantly mop up after his two sidekicks. The Fire Festival was also quite thrilling, but what could have been a mesmerizing duel between Rokurota and Hyoe Tadokoro was something short of monumental. Hyoe's spear is broken and he just gives up? That didn't seem to be in keeping with the spirit of rival generals battling to the death over honor and country.I was puzzled by the mention of Mt. Suribachi in the story; that's where Rokurota claims he found gold when the travelers are stopped on the road by the toll men. The only Suribachi I know of is on the island of Iwo Jima - not impossible I guess for the story to incorporate, but that doesn't seem likely to me for a story set centuries ago.Equally dissonant for me was a comment from one of Rokurota's companions on the road. When things weren't going particularly well at one point, one of them states \"This sucks\". Now maybe that's a quirk of translation on the Criterion Collection DVD I saw this film on, but it seems to me that there might have been a better way of putting it.

Through a series of mishaps and absurd circumstances, they find themselves unwittingly aiding Rokurota Makabe, a general of the defeated Akizuki clan, whose task is to protect the young Princess Yuki from her foes and guide her to safety.All of the actors are excellent \u2013 Mifune is top-notch here, as usual \u2013 but it was Misa Uehara as the princess that made the deepest impression on me. She conveyed the haughtiness of a girl raised in privilege, but was able to skillfully bring out the strength and humanity of her character. There is a scene where this young woman, who up until this point has seemed the epitome of fierceness and pride, stands alone and begins to weep while gazing out at the horizon. The banner of her clan is superimposed over her anguished face as she lets tears fall for her murdered family, well aware of the weight of her sorrow and new responsibility in a harsh world. Over the course of the film, she will see greed, deceit, honesty and decency firsthand. She will bear witness to human compassion and human suffering. Her experiences will shape her into a better ruler.Such elements add profoundness to \"The Hidden Fortress\", making it more than simply a standard action/adventure movie. Still, it keeps up suspense, excitement, and humor \u2013 sometimes all at once. For example, at one point the little group must get past a roadblock set up by the enemy. The scene that ensues artfully combines a sense of quiet apprehension and unease with comedy. Viewers remain on the edges of their seats, yet are able to laugh as well.Kurosawa accomplished the rarest of feats with this motion picture.

            "content": "This is not a war movie, duh!  To those who miss all the action in recent movies, too bad.  Most modern movies have almost ZERO character development. This movie seems slow if you are waiting for something that looks like Matrix remake #247 to happen.  It doesn't.  Instead,the characters development is created with humor and wit (find that in a modern movie and no, Dumb and Dumber is not humor and wit) over enough time so you actually have some understand of who the characters are are even though the dialog is minimal.  The plot is simple and the perils accelerate as the story is developed.It's a beautiful movie, funny, tense, strong female lead (in Japan in 1958), handsome leading man, and it leaves you with a good feeling.The lack of action is an illusion because you are looking for a battle and miss the real battle.  It is a battle of the wits from the beginning to the end.  The witless peasants have a great idea, the princess can't be outwitted by her general, the general can't win by fighting overwhelming odds, so he outwits his opponents.It's a movie for people who aren't half-wits.  Maybe you need to be old enough to care to think about what is going on.  If you like monster truck races, this is probably not your movie.If you liked the Cary Grant screwball comedies, you will probably like this. If you don't know who Cary Grant is and haven't seen at least 4 or 5 off his movies, you're missing a lot of fun (and wit).

The role played by Toshiro Mifune can not be regarded as a bad guy. In fact he was a good guy. As comparison, The good,the bad,the ugly is clearer and indisputable.The story is simple. It is about how a defeated princess escapes the hunting of enemy and goes to safe place. Due to the existence of the two bad guys, the process is interesting and thrilling. Luckily with the \"bad\" guy's(Toshiro Mifune) help, they succeed.The relationship between the two bad guys is thought provoking. When they were poor, they could live in harmony. Once they became rich, they would get greedy and hurt each other. But finally they reconciled. The interaction between them was the most interesting part in the movie.It looks like that Toshiro Mifune is Akira Kurosawa's favorite actor. He also played in famous Shichinin no samurai,Roshomon. I always appreciate his lively performance.One of the best of Akira Kurosawa. 9/10",

Seven Samurai was a milestone, no doubt, but The Hidden Fortress is completely different. It's got more comedy thanks to the characters of Chiaki and Fujiwara who play a couple of peasants ready to do anything for a piece of gold. They're the main reason why I liked this movie so much; their duo and their chemistry is undeniably attractive and you just can't get enough of their fooling around. Toshiro Mifune (the one I liked the most in Seven Samurai) plays here a somewhat different character, a tough and loyal general who can easily give up his life for his princess. All of the main cast are amazing and there's nothing to discuss here.\nThe cinematography is as fine as ever, the dialogues are over the top, the fight scenes are a bit flat and they lack action, the antagonists are dumb and their actions are far-fetched but all in all this is an incredible movie with lots of laughs and the plot that keeps you interested until the very end.",

Pretending to be mute around Tahei and Matashichi, Uehara expresses in her body language Yuki's feisty confidence just under the surface of her muted state,which reveals itself in the thrilling Action scenes, with Uehara trimming Yuki's fantasy princess into a burning, independent warrior, who joins in the long fighting across the land.Bickering across every step of the adventure whilst keeping their eyes on the prize, Kamatari Fujiwara and Minoru Chiaki give absolutely wonderful performances as Matashichi and Tahei, thanks to the duo criss-crossing snappy comedic exchanges with a scrambling desperation to flee to freedom, as they find themselves becoming entangled in a group.Dragging the camera along the ground towards Tahei and Matashichi in the opening shot of the first movie he shot in widescreen, and the last he made for Toho studios, editor/ co-writer (with regular collaborators Ryuzo Kikushima, Shinobu Hashimoto & Hideo Oguni) / directing auteur Akira Kurosawa reunites with cinematographer Kazuo Yamazaki for the second, and final time, in order to expertly cross the up-close panning shots and close-ups of his Film Noir works such as Stray Dog (1949-also reviewed), with the long-lens, vast canvas shots of his historical titles such as Throne of Blood (1957-also reviewed.)Filmed on location around the slopes of Mt. Fuji as the Kanagawa typhoon took place,and backed by a rousing Doh score from regular composer of this era Masaru Sato, (who was only given a week to do the score) Kurosawa follows the group crossing enemy lines in beautifully composed wide-shots, which Kurosawa fills the corners of with incoming action on the edges,and the long path in the centre, that they must walk down to reach freedom.Moving to the beats of Sato's score, Kurosawa's distinctive screen-wipes cut across with a refine eye of ultra-stylized panning shots of Matashichi and Tahei stumbling through every obstacle, as they get the ecstasy of gold from the hidden fortress.",

And yes, you can pick out most of the Star Wars characters \u0096 even C3PO and R2D2 \u0096 in Kurosawa's original. None the less, this is a Japanese film, made in that land, set in Japan, but in a past century.

            "content": "Whether it's among Akira Kurosawa's best movies or not, there's no denying that The Hidden Fortress occupies a unique place in his catalogue. I've seen a lot of his movies, and I'd have to say this one is the most stylistically interesting for its refusal to commit to any particular tone for an extended period. It's sort of a weird adventure-comedy hybrid, and probably a little too long for its own good, but The Hidden Fortress is still a mighty entertaining story that contains many of the hallmarks of Kurosawa's classic samurai-era epics. Themes of sacrifice, loyalty, and friendship run throughout, joined by a comedic sensibility that you don't generally find in Kurosawa's movies (Yojimbo being a notable exception). Visually the movie is incredible, with tons of brilliant widescreen shots of Japan's mountainous countryside that unsurprisingly bring to mind Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, and while there isn't an abundance of action the one extended fight scene is memorably intense and impeccably staged.Naturally, this being a Kurosawa movie, the characterizations are excellent, although the cast of principals isn't too big this time around. Toshiro Mifune delivers his usual commanding performance as Rokurota Makabe, a general from a defeated army trying to sneak the teenage princess of his ruling family to safety. Like pretty much every character Mifune played in a Kurosawa film, Rukurota is complex and fascinating, an action hero who never descends into clich\u00e9. He fits very nicely into the same tough-guy mode as Mifune's characters in Rashomon and Yojimbo, but at the same time Makabe has a very clear sense of honor and duty that shows through his mostly hidden emotions. The princess, too, is an interesting figure, as her youth and privileged status don't keep her from voicing her opinions or getting caught up in the action.Of course, while the plot centers around Makabe's mission to sneak the princess through enemy lines, the story is told largely through the eyes of Matakishi and Tahei, two bumbling and impoverished peasants who end up tagging along in the hopes of improving their situations. Although they commit some decidedly underhanded acts, Matakishi and Tahei aren't really malicious per se--they just act the way most people probably would when thrust into a desperate situation, which is to say they try to get whatever they can whenever they can. They think of little beyond gratifying their most immediate desires, but they're so blatantly stupid they can't help but be at least a little sympathetic.The Hidden Fortress is actually almost two separate movies that occasionally converge, with one following Makabe and the princess as they struggle to find a safe haven, and the other tracking Tahei and Matakishi's attempts to get rich quick. And while its alternating focus may result in a lot of tonal shifts, the movie hardly suffers for it. In the end, The Hidden Fortress may not be the Kurosawa movie to start with, but for fans it's obviously a must.",

Kurosawa was at his best making playful action/adventure flicks like this. Simply superb. There are things to fault in Rashomon (its action sequences), and things to fault in Seven Samurai (action sequences are messy, bit too long, and its not as exotic as Hidden Fortress, which moves around many different locations), but i could find nothing to fault in Hidden Fortress. Niggling little faults do not cancel out a movie's status as great, i think - there is no such thing as actual perfection in movies, and if there was, i'm sure it would be utterly boring. But all the elements of Hidden Fortress really seemed to come together and work for me really well. Its really well shot, gorgeously. Filled with adventure: exciting fights, chases on horseback, pleanty of exotic desert and forest locations, and the great ceremony of fire scene. It has great music, a great sense of fun and playfulness, and its performances are very good. One of Toshiro Mifune's best i think. But the main element i'm going on here is enjoyment - i just enjoyed the hell out of Hidden Fortress. Bravo Akira Kurosawa!Note: i had to do what i like to call interpretive subtitle reading. If you get a chinese copy of this (there aren't many other options, at time of writing), you'll have trouble understanding at times. The subtitles are poor, because they've been translated from japanese into chinese, then chinese into english. Don't expect proper phrasing or language use. You have to try and use them as a guide only to what the sentence means. My best advice is to wait for Criterion to do it up properly. They'll do a proper, quality translation when they do. The Criterion Rashomon and Seven Samurai discs have great subtitles.",

Toshir\u00f4 Mifune is his usual great, although I dare say his role doesn't give him a lot to work with.As for the story, it is impossible to see the resemblance with the Star Wars film it inspired. The rogues are not a sexy smiling Ford and a physically expressive hairy giant, but more akin to two almost naked monkeys, wearing dirty rags and fighting for fruit (gold in this situation). It's more of a \"cunning peasant\" story, where the proud princess and her guardian must navigate enemy territory in order to escape, using smarts instead of force, misdirection instead of violence.This is not one of those \"Japan is green and great and everybody is noble\" films, but a gritty black and white arduous trek through barren mountain and behind enemy lines. It has humor, it has some violence, but it's mostly about human frailty. I am glad I watched it, but more as a badge of cinephilia than because of the film itself.",

Sharing his adventures are a plucky and willful young princess and two hilariously foolish, venal and horny peasants. Their task is to convey the princess, along with a large cache of hidden gold, through enemy lines to safety. It's not a complicated plot but, in the hands of director Akira Kurosawa, it becomes a veritable roller-coaster ride of thrills.

The film is frequently cited as an inspiration for 'Star' Wars (1977) but elements such as the hidden identities, royalty disguised as peasants, the homeward journey, heroes with comic sidekicks, heroic cleverness vs. villainous muscle etc. are near universal. 'The Hidden Fortress' is well-made and very entertaining although it is a bit long for the material (some scenes could have used a little shortening). The cast is full of recognisable members of director Akira Kurosawa's usual acting company (including a small part for the great Takashi Shimura) and diakaiju fans may recognise Minoru Chiaki as the ill-fated Kobayashi in 1955's 'Godzilla Raids Again' (the often underrated sequel to Godzilla). The subtitled version of 'The Hidden Fortress' recently shown on TCM is very well done (although I don't think terms such as \"s--t-head\" were on-screen when I first saw this film in the 1980's).

            "content": "Famously one of the main points of inspiration that George Lucas used to write the first Star Wars film, The Hidden Fortress was Akira Kurosawa chasing financial success with a big, brash action adventure after his last film, an adaptation of a Maxim Gorky play, didn't exactly set the box office on fire. The film feels like a boys adventure story brought to life with close calls, chases, and danger around every corner. I could have done with a slightly different focus and the earlier introductions of some important later elements, but I still have a solidly good experience every time I come back to revisit the movie.Two peasants, Tahei (Minoru Chiaki) and Matashichi (Kamatari Fujiwara) are returning from their efforts to try and make it rich in a war between the Akizuki and Yamana clans where the Akizuki have been all but wiped out. The two peasants are completely destitute and barely even dressed when they witness the killing of a lone Akizuki soldier by Yamana cavalry, and the two decide to split in different directions. Tahei stumbles up against the tightly controlled border between Akizuki and Hayakawa by Yamana forces before being captured by Yamana forces. Matashichi gets immediately captured with stolen Akizuki armor and is pressganged in with dozens of other prisoners to dig under the Akizuki castle for two-hundred gold pieces that they supposedly left behind. The two end up back together and escape during a prisoner revolt, figuring out a way to get back into Hayakawa territory by going into Yamana territory and then back up into Hayakawa.As they make their way, they accidentally come across a bit of wood that has a piece of Akizuki gold hidden inside. They strike out searching for more and encounter a mysterious man, Rokurota Makabe (Toshiro Mifune), who decides to join them in their plan of escape, leading the pair to the titular hidden fortress in the mountains. It is here the that the last remaining member of the Akizuki royal family, Princess Yuki (Misa Uehara), is hiding under Makabe's protection as her last general. They have the gold hidden in wooden sticks, and decide to use the two peasants and their greed to help them on the perilous journey.The movie puts what I think is an inordinate focus on Tahei and Matashichi. This story isn't theirs. They are side characters in Makabe's story. The focus on them, that only ever wanes in the film's last third or so, reminds me of early John Ford, especially in something like The Iron Horse. The side characters are fun and entertaining, for sure, but since the story isn't actually theirs, they end up a large distraction. Makabe is the central character here. He has the most interesting relationships. He goes on the most interesting emotional journey. He's the one driving the plot. He really should be the focus once the two peasants meet him, but we get so many scenes of the pair being blinded by the greed of the gold. Always amusing they are, but they just take the focus away from Makabe.The group of four strike out from the hiding space, Yuki pretending to be a mute to hide her royal upbringing, and they immediately find trouble when the border to Yamana is more tightly controlled than they had suspected. Using one of the pieces of gold as a distraction, Makabe causes a scene with the commander of the border crossing that allows Yuki and the two peasants to slip by unnoticed. Word reaches the border station of the description of the party, based on the tracks from the hidden fortress that had been found and burned out, and the chase is on. Yuki forces Makabe to buy the freedom of an Akizuki girl (Toshiko Higuchi) that had been sold into a pleasure house. They trade their horses for a cart, and it seems like they should be able to sneak through having changed both their numbers and mode of transportation, but the Yamana soldiers aren't that simple. They figure it out, forcing Makabe into a chase back to their staging area, and we get, 90 minutes into the film, the most interesting relationship in the whole movie.Makabe faces off against the Yamana commander, General Hyoe Tadokoro (Susumu Fujita), and the two have a history. They are long time friends who ended up on the wrong sides of this conflict that they did not choose. They have a spear duel, tense and ever-changing in that great action way, and Makabe wins, refusing to kill his foe as an act of compassion. I really, really wish Tadokoro had been introduced earlier, especially since he comes up later in a very important way that gets our heroes out of a desperate jam. The quick dialogue at the start of the duel about how they are friends just isn't enough, I don't think. Something early, like Tahei or Matashachi overhearing Tadokoro talk about Makabe, might have been enough, but introducing him at the 90-minute point underserves the characters.The group gets in with a procession of festival goers to celebrate the Fire Festival, thinking that they'll blend in well enough, but they can't get away and end up needing to dump the wood that hides the gold into the fire to blend in. They collect the melted bits of metal the next morning, packing it all into heavy sacks, and we're ready for the final confrontation near the Hayakawa border. Makabe, Yuki, and the girl get captured after Tahei and Matashachi run away. The Yamana have the princess and the gold, and all seems lost when Tadokoro shows up, listens to their pleas after having been beaten for his failure with Makabe by his lord, and he fights to let them all go. This is a big turn of events for an important secondary character, and I really just wish he had been given more time earlier in the film to more firmly establish himself before he made such a large change that affected the story.So, my complaints are relatively small. A greater focus on Makabe instead of our two amusing peasants and an earlier introduction of Tadokoro really would have helped the film. Outside of that, this is fun adventure stuff that I really do enjoy. The spear duel between Makabe and Tadokoro is tense and well-filmed. There's a real sense of danger as the group moves closer to peril in an effort to protect themselves. The overall action of the movement of characters is very clearly laid out early, allowing us to just go along with the story.I also want to say that I don't think I've ever seen a director move from the Academy aspect ratio of 1.33:1 to scope 2.35:1 more adeptly than Kurosawa did here. The Lower Depths was his last film in the Academy ratio, and he embraced the wider frame of Tohoscope unbelievably well. I remembered John Ford's first attempt, The Long Gray Line, and how it often felt like he was still trying to frame for Academy, leaving characters in the center of frame with almost absurd amounts of space left to the sides. That never happens here in The Hidden Fortress. Kurosawa utilizes the full frame, unafraid to paint at the edges, place two conversing characters at the far sides of the frame with something interesting in the middle to separate them, or allow action to move from one side to the other. He was well-known for storyboarding his films through paintings, and it's obvious he learned quickly that he could and should use the whole space. In addition, it might be his most impressive physical production with huge sets that he utilizes fully as well. It's honestly one of Kurosawa's best looking films.The Hidden Fortress is a fun adventure film that's never dull but probably could have been improved with a couple of smallish narrative changes. It's also great to look at and has Toshiro Mifune being the movie star he was, carrying the whole thing with humor and intensity.",

            "content": "Now though top billing and much of the screen time is afforded to Kurosawa regular Toshir\u00f4 Mifune (\"Gen. Makabe\") this film really belongs to the two opportunistic farmers \"Matakichi\" (Kamatari Fujiwara) and \"Tahei\" (Minori Chiaki). These two chancers learn of a fortune in gold hidden away after their land is invaded by their neighbours. Off they set to discover it, and along the way stumble upon the general in his mountain-top eerie. Now it's not really a fortress, more a big shack at the top of a hill, but they soon discover it hides something way more valuable than gold. The Princess \"Yuki\" (Misa Uehara) who is wanted by her enemies even more than the treasure. Their bumbling ineptitude and curiosity married with their greed and of course - acute sense of self preservation - leads them to join with the fleeing couple and for all four to try and smuggle the princess and the loot to the safety of an adjacent kingdom where safety awaits. What ensues now is a series of entertaining and perilous adventures that allow each character to take centre stage. Mifune is very much in his element as the loyal, chivalrous - and pretty lethal - general; the Princess is no shrinking violet either and along the way we are entertained to an engaging assessment of the venality, mendacity and couragousness of war - it brings out the best and the worst in everyone. There is an almost Laurel and Hardy feeling to the end of this perfectly paced adventure film, which certainly raises a smile and I thoroughly enjoyed this.",

            "review_title": "Forgettable Kurosawa film.",
            "content": "Hidden Fortress is the only Kurosawa film I have watched so far that I did not enjoy. The reasons I thought this Kurosawa film was lackadaisical:1) Story very slow to unfold: Only after a full hour does the characters journey to smuggle the princess to Hayakawa commence. The first hour is monotonous and mostly consists of Tahei and Matakashi annoyingly bickering with each other while wandering about an equally monotonous landscape. Even when the plot finally starts to unfold, nothing much happens. The action scenes are few, and the few present are apathetic. For example, in the duel between Makabe and Tadokoro the choreography is too apparent and the fight itself is very dull. But a lack of action can easily be overshadowed by intriguing characters. Unfortunately, Hidden Fortress lacks both.2) Highly annoying characters: I simply did not care for any of the characters. Tahei and Matakashi are the comic relief of the film, but after a while their ignorance and incessant bickering seizes being funny and starts being irritating. Princess Yuki is by far the most annoying character of the film, but the actress Misa Uehara is to blame. Her acting is completely awful! Her strident voice and stiff mannerisms is unbearable. Also, after that scene when she is crying, mourning the death of her decoy, it's no surprise that she didn't win any awards for best actress. She might have won a Razzie if it existed when the movie was made. Her acting was so \"powerful\" and \"moving\" that she made me cry when towards the end of the movie she sings a poignant song...I was crying from laughter, though. Mifune is also a disappointment in Hidden Fortress, but this is Kurosawa's fault. Mifune is too restrained as the obedient, loyal servant and doesn't display his terrific swordplay or justified arrongance as much as in his other roles. The best scene of the film is when Mifune finally releases the inner lion inside him and chases down and eliminates two guards on horseback. The prostitute Princess Yuki rescues is also irritating. She should have let Matakashi and Tahei have their way with Princess Yuki while she slept. They drew sticks\u0085It was fair and square. The butch prostitute should just have waited her turn.3) Lack of a definite antagonist/threat: At one point of the movie, Gen.Tadokoro (Susumu Fujita) appears to be the antagonist, but the viewer later finds out he is not. But during and before the duel, when I believed Tadokoro was the main antagonist, I thought that Fujita was badly cast. Fujita's Tadokoro looked emaciated and is much older (or at least looks so) than Mifune. Judging on appearance and physique, I felt that Tadokoro did not pose much of a threat to Immune's Makabe and even the little challenge he does provide during the duel was unrealistic. But the real antagonist of the film is the Yamana Tribe. But through out the movie Kurosawa depicts the army and its commanders as inept and craven. Therefore, the lack of any real menacing threat denigrated my concern for the characters, since I did not feel as if their journey was as dangerous as it was made out to be. Also, why was the Yamana Tribe necessarily bad? In the movie they are never shown to be corrupt, depraved or unjust. So what if they beheaded the decoy who they believed to be the princess; she is an enemy to them. And also, where in the movie does it depict the Princess' Akizuki tribe as being benevolent and kind-hearted? For all I know, she could be the evil one.The whole effectiveness of the story relies heavily on the conditions that the viewer cares for the character, especially the well-being of the princess, which I did not; and also on the fact that the viewer perceives that the characters are in grave danger, which I also did not. Therefore, I did not appreciate Hidden Fortress as much as other Kurosawa films. Only merit of this movie is that it \"influenced\" Lucas in his Star Wars saga. I place quotes on influence because it's not so much of an influence as it is a source pool from which Lucas exhaustingly siphons.",

A historically unrealistic portrayal of Princess Highness as a politically, mentally and physically powerful woman, guided by Toshiro Mifune, fulfills males' fantasy of both protecting and being protected by a strong woman. While halting the otherwise up-tempo story, the Fellini-esque, imaginatively beautiful dance-around-the-fire scene may stick to a viewer's mind longest.

Sorry George, I don't get it. So I get this DVD from a friend who loves Japanese movies.  For the first half hour or so, I'm following two stupid, greedy peasants who fall into one dumb mishap after another.  I'm left thinking what's the point here?  This is really lame.  Eventually, a mysterious samurai general appears, none other than Toshiro Mifune, (THE Shogun), who uses these contemptible idiots to his advantage in transporting a spoiled, order-barking princess to safety. Mifune's powerful acting, coupled with absolutely the most beautiful panoramic B&W long-angle photography, make this movie a worthwhile view. There's magic in the fire festival, where the villagers burn all their world-sorrows in a bonfire, while frenetically dancing and singing to a dirgelike song. While I hear that the two clowns in this movie are the inspiration for R2D2 and C3PO of Star Wars, it's only a vague inspiration at best.  (Ok, well, maybe there's an exiled princess and a Jedi master or so...)  There are fundamental differences: the 'droids are motivated by duty to mission, and the clowns are motivated by greed.  Princess Leia is a world-wise action figure, Princess Yuki is a spoiled brat.  The plots bear no similarity, no war of conquest over an evil empire. My suggestion? Forget Star Wars on this one.

After all Kurosawa did not get a story credit on star wars because the movie itself is vastly different.The main similarities are as followed: Matakishi & Tahei show a striking resemblance to C3PO & R2D2. Early in the film they fight, get separated, then both caught at the same time. Sound familiar? They are also the comic relief in this movie, and are both very funny.Princess Yuki is a similar character to Princess Leia, both are tomboys, both are headstrong and both have no homeland to return to. Princess Yuki has a body double killed, the same way Senator Amidala does in attack of the clones.General Tadokoro is a similar character to Lando Calrissian, he is friends with Rokurota Makabe but is also on the side of the enemy. He has divided loyalties.Rokurota Makabe is a cross between Luke and Hans without really being that similar to either.Samurai swords, Light sabres. Get it.The differences are too many to mention, however I will say that most noticeable is the older characters, like Yoda and Obi Wan, that are missing from this movie. Overall the movies are quite different, but I am glad I watched this movie, as it was brilliant to watch with or without stars wars as a reference.

Close ups are rare (unlike the current crop of tent-pole films that use quick-cut extreme close-ups to simulate \"action\" to the point of nausea). Director Akira Kurosawa fills the wide screen down to the square centimeter (one of his directorial trademarks). The video restoration is flawless. Not so much so for the audio restoration which contains occasional distortions. Film score is so-so, adding to the impact of some scenes, distracting from others. Subtitles are perfunctory and skip over some subtle and some not so subtle nuances. Costumes are, well, \"interesting.\" Can't help but wonder how many young women publicly wore rather short shorts and tight blouses in feudal Japan! Or how extremely rugged terrain was navigated by folks wearing only sandals! Now to the story line, script, and acting. This film cries out for a \"Director's Cut\" version (or at least the outtakes), as many scenes are disjointed and abrupt with characters conveying information either gained from telepathy or by viewing the dailies! As for the story line, it's predicable and lame. Acting is uneven: two characters (used to stitch scenes together and provide marginal comic relief) are allowed to outrageously ham it up; the leading actress (Misa Uehara) plays scenes in a state of sustained hysteria (except when playing a deaf mute); and the leading actor (Toshiro Mifune) essentially plays a supporting role (except for some action scenes).

There are several reasons for me finally viewing Hidden Fortress. One reason is that I have had several friends recommend this film and the main reason is because it is the inspiration for the Star Wars: A New Hope. I will first focus on why this film was such a disappointment for this reviewer. At first I thought the banter between the characters of Tahei and Matashichi was amusing. That being said, within ten minutes of this banter and their actions I was quickly annoyed by these characters. I kept hoping throughout the film that these two characters would develop into better and less annoying characters. Unfortunately this characters remained one dimensional with only a glimmer of growth at the end. In addition, the Princess Yuki character was just as annoying and whinny(at least during the first half). My second problem with Hidden Fortress is the pacing. The pacing of this film is tedious, aimless, and without a sense of urgency or suspense.I know that the characters of this film have to be cautions, but you would think there would a little urgency in getting the princess over hostile territory. That being said, I believe that Tahei and Matashichi hindered both the mission in the film and the film itself. The good of the film are the characters of General Rokurota and later Princess Yuki. Unlike two characters mentioned in this review, Yuki seems to demonstrate a sense of character development/depth. I would also say that my favorite character is The Old General. I actually cared about his character. Secondly, the direction and cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. And thirdly, the pacing during the second half improved and I felt some sense of suspense. I give the film a 6/10 and or a C+. I do look forward to watching Yojimbo sometime soon.",

If you find that hard to believe put your mind to rest knowing that for the next two weeks I had seen all of Kurosawa's Samurai movies, and I had found one of my new top 5 favourite directors. But that's not all, for here I am also introduced to the likes of Toshiro Mifune, an icon in every sense of the word who went on to collaborate with Kurosawa for 16 wonderful movies.It's also been well documented that \"The Hidden Fortress\", served as one of the inspirations for George Lucas's \"Star Wars\" (1977). Two peasants (Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara) intend to fight for the winning Yamana clan, but unfortunately get mistaken for the dwindling Akizuki clan and forced into burying the dead and digging for the failing clans gold. A chance uprising allows both to escape unharmed and throughout their travels and eternal squabbling they stumble across some Akizuki gold, attracting the attention of a certain gruff General (Toshiro Mifune). This leads both men being enlisted to unknowingly help the Akizuki Princess (Misa Uehara) cross the Yamana territories in hope to rebuild the broken clan.From the opening shot it's adventure, action and sheer spectacle. The musical score is loud and ever rising to highlight the tension and dangers of feudal Japan, which are beautifully rendered in great establishing shots. Toshiro Mifune's character shines as the wonderful no-nonsense General. Makabe Rokur\u014dta, which impressed Lucas enough he asked Mifune to play Obi-Wan Kenobi. Finally, Kurosawa's camera-work is as natural as it comes, and the acting is wonderful from all fronts which I now know are made up of a few of Kurosawa's regular casting choices.Final Verdict: \"The Hidden Fortress\" remains a wonderful blockbuster Jidaigeki movie, and as my introduction to Kurosawa's filmography I have nothing but fond memories. 9/10.",

The lightest and most relaxed film, in terms of rigor, drama and basic pillars of Kurosawa's style, aimed to an audience that wants to enjoy the evening watching a film, but with great quality. It has a lot of humor, which play well with the main premise, creating the ideal balance between an epic storyline and a funny film. The photography is very good, with fantastic shots of mountains and fields. The swordfight between the hero (Toshiro Mifune) and his rival (Susumu Fujita) is at the level of the fights of Seven Samurai or Ran, and the pursuit scene of the protagonists, in somekind of cat and mousse game, is one of the most tense and exciting scenes that Kurosawa has directed in his career.",

            "review_title": "A rip-roaring action-adventure recalling big-budget Hollywood productions of the 1950s, but it maintains all of Kurosawa's particular strengths",
            "content": "Released in 1958, Akira Kurosawa's THE HIDDEN FORTRESS is an action-adventure in the age of the samurai. As the film opens, two buffoonish peasants, Tahei (Minoru Chiaki) and Matashichi (Kamatari Fujiwara) are heading home after failing to make a living as mercenaries. Dramatic events have happened in their region: the Yamana clan has laid waste to the lands of the Akizuki clan. Only the Akizuki princess, Yuki (Misa Uehara) and her clan's dashing general Rokurota (Toshiro Mifune) have managed to escape, hiding out in the hidden fortress of the title, but the Yamana have put out a large reward for their capture. As General Rokurota and Princess Yuki set off from their refuge for the safe territory of an allied clan, the general enlists Tahei and Matashichi to help and carry their loads. The film is richly comedic, as the peasants are oblivious to the identity of their boss and his lady, and they are continually led astray from the escape plan by their greed, but Rokurota always finds a way to make their foolishness work to his and the princess's advantage.In many respects, this is the closest of Kurosawa's films to the 1950s big-budget \"Hollywood movie\". It is an extravaganza shot in Cinemascope with amazing stunts on horseback, a dramatic fight scene between the hero and a village, and a riotous village dance at festival time. It is easy to see why the film was such a smash success in Japan and abroad. Don't think this is any commercial sellout, though, as THE HIDDEN FORTRESS maintains all the strengths of Kurosawa's work in this period, with believable, nuanced characterization, innovative camera techniques, and dramatic samurai clashes that show an awareness of American Westerns.The acting in particular is incredible: Toshiro Mifune shows a perfect confidence in his role and his great versatility where he could be stern and severe one moment, maniacally laughing the next. Both of the peasants are hilarious, and while Kamatari Fujiwara was long known as a comedic actor, Minoru Chiaki here shows a different side than in earlier Kurosawa films. Surprisingly, Princess Yuki is mainly in the background; her appearance on film posters or DVD boxes might lead you to expect a prominent role and maybe some daring action sequences from her (she is said to be a tomboy, after all), but mainly she plays only a supporting character serving as a social critique of Japanese rulers, and the bulk of the story plays out between Rokurota and the peasants. Misa Uehara is a seductive screen presence in the bits she has, though, and it is perhaps a loss to cinema that she retired from her brief acting career soon after.While THE HIDDEN FORTRESS is perhaps not as \"deep\" or psychologically intense as certain other Kurosawa films (such as THRONE OF BLOOD), this is an all-around great movie, a heck of a lot of fun for any casual view, and full of filmmaking details that cinema anoraks can chew on. I would generally recommend it to all and sundry.The obligatory George Lucas mention: Kurosawa served as a light inspiration for STAR WARS, namely showing much of the action from the viewpoint of the lowliest characters. However, except for that feature, there aren't many similarities between Kurosawa's film and that later science-fiction blockbuster; Lucas's championing of the film is a good thing inasmuch as it might bring Kurosawa to a wider audience, but it has the downside of perhaps prejudicing one's expectations.",

            "content": "When a movie is directed by a world-class master Akira Kurosawa, when it is said to be the inspiration behind one of the greatest adventure movies ever, \"Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\", one could expect a lot. However \"Hidden Fortress\" is not in every way a superb samurai-adventure movie.The movie has its moments with nice widescreen though black-and-white outdoor shootings, costumes of the 16th century Japan, sword fighting, and all kinds of swashbuckling. But meantime the music is perhaps too pompous in Kurosawa style and most of the sound effects absolutely awful even on the standards of 1958. There is a plot of hidden gold, Hidden Fortress, and of course saving the princess in the Warring States period Japan, but what took Kurosawa 2 hours and 19 minutes to explain could have been done in 90 minutes.Characters are perhaps the biggest drawback of the \"Hidden Fortress\" with runaway peasant-soldiers Tahei (Minoru Chiaki) and Matashichi (Kamatari Fujiwara) continuously too coward and too stupid, princess Yuki (Misa Uehara) too tomboy woman in the 16th century Japan, and even general Rokurota (Toshir\u014d Mifune) all the time too cool and almighty to be real... But it is not all bad! Perhaps it is partly a child of its time, it is the inspiration of Star Wars, it is just not the level of Seven Samurai nor Kurosawa's other masterpieces.",

            "review_title": "Baffled",
            "content": "With all the good reviews and high ratings, I was looking forward to watching Akira Kurasawa's Hidden Fortress. In the end, while I would not rate it as a complete failure, I was left baffled at where its supposed greatness lies.The story centers around two Japanese peasants caught up in a war, who meet two strangers (unbeknown to them an important general accompanying a princess) and employed by them to support them during a passage through enemy territory.The journey only begins about in the middle of the film, not much happens in the overlong first half. Most of the first half is spent in the \"Hidden Fortress\" of the title, with the general getting ready for the journey and apparently \"testing\" the peasants by giving them the task to dig for a hidden treasure although he actually knows where it is all along, Nothing of significance happens here. The pace finally picks up when they start their journey. From the on, the plot gets better, mainly typical \"quest\" adventure fare, solid but not outstanding, with a spear battle between Mifune's general and a rival military leader as the one highlight that I would consider having some claim to greatness.Even more disappointing than the plot are the characters. Toshiro Mifune's charisma goes to some lengths to save the general's character. The three remaining characters are paper thin and annoying The peasants are merely caricatures that serve to be made fun of but the laughs, if there are any, would be at their stupidity rather than anything else - imagine Laurel and Hardy without and good gags.As far as the princess is concerned - I think one should be careful to judge actors in foreign language films but in this case I would be prepared to say that her acting is atrocious. It consists of looking at nobody in particular and shouting out haughty statements. There is some attempt at in depth characterisation - I think she is supposed to be wise beyond her age and relish the hardship of the journey as it helps her to get to know her people better, but this whole plot line is just poorly executed.A last plus poiint, the cinematography is pretty good and the costumes, the set and the battle/crowd scenes are designed and shot to a high standard (although the princess's mini skirt and blouse somehow seem very much to look forward to womenswear of the late 1950s and 60s - but what do I know about Japanese fashion in the medieval times or whenever this film is set). All in all it is a bit of disappointment, though.",

            "content": "In the first half, he spends money on crowd scenes and a set of castle burns. As a Japanese movie, it must have been a business adventure. Such a powerful and expensive movie became such an interesting masterpiece and the movie company would have been very happy. As a movie fan, I want to rejoice that this wonderful movie was left today.\nThe screenplay success was caused by two greedy people. The two argued as if they were angry, but if they were a little more clever, it could bore the movie. The spine of this script is \"Is it possible to control these two people well and escape safely?\"\nThe first half looks a bit long, but the rest is a roller coaster. It is an entertainment masterpiece that screenwriters finished their best by twisting their heads.\nIn that respect, Star Wars that was inspired by this work has failed a little. There is no suspense around the two characters. R2D2 is too understandable. It's not interesting because the characters don't collide with each other. So Star Wars seems like of its middle part of the story is stretched out. The point that Star Wars is better than this movie is the excitement of the climax. This movie has no climax. Making a climax makes the story too long. That would cost too much money. So Akira Kurosawa's screenplay team probably wondered where to cut and squeeze. They cut the climax! Akira Kurosawa covers this shortcoming with his long time shoot. This has the effect of tension by keeping the camera fixed. Akira Kurosawa is good at that camera work.\nIn this movie, the beauty of the film appears well, and the ups of Mifune are particularly gracious and beautiful. That's not the case for digital so far. Film director, use film for movie.",

            "content": "This is the first Kurosawa film I've had the pleasure of seeing and I have to say, after all the hype, there's not a whole lot to recommend. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it but I think it's time that some of the overzealous praise died down.Here's the basic plot: There's a huge war raging and two looters, a samurai and a princess are trying to make it across enemy lines. And, well, that's about it.Now listen, before I go on my rant I have to say that there were quite a few things I appreciated about this film. Kurosawa has a great eye and the film certainly looks good. I also liked some of the subplots, especially the one about the captive woman who is rescued by the princess and becomes something of a bodyguard to her. That was a really nice touch and I thought it was sweet how that woman was willing to put her life on the line to save her rescuer.The best thing about this film, though, is the subtle humor. There's lots of situational humor here, and the amusing performances from the two thieves makes for plenty of much-needed laughs. The whole film also has a great sense of adventure to it, so that's worth recommending too.Unfortunately, there's just not a lot going on here. The film runs over 2 hours and yet I still didn't feel satisfied at the end. For the first hour not much happens; just the two theives repeatedly making fools of themselves and Mifune laughing his ass off at them. When the actual 'journey' begins, there's not much noteworthy about it. Just a lot of sneaking around. No real chase scenes, no battle scenes -- nothing.Now, I know this is a 50's movie. I didn't expect this to be an action bonanza a la MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2. But there just weren't thrills in this film to quench my Hollywood-bred self. I wanted more!!! More duels (there *is* one -- and it's snore-inducing), more explosions, more ANYTHING!Another thing that really bothered me was the performance by the gal who played the princess. She's *constantly* yelling -- in fact, everything she says sounds like she's screaming at the top of her lungs. She's not necessarily a bad actress, but her grating voice did get on my nerves after a while.Overall, I'd definitely recommend THE HIDDEN FORTRESS -- but to *rent*, not to *buy*. This is NOT a masterpiece, it is NOT flawless and it is DEFINITELY NOT an action film! You've been warned!",
