            "content": "My mother kept an old clipping for years describing SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS when it opened at Radio City Music Hall and received a rave review from newspaper columnist Westbrook Pegler. He usually wrote about politics but on this occasion he took time to devote an entire review to Disney's new film. He called it a \"masterpiece\" and said that when the projectionist slipped those reels of film on the projector, the audience at the Music Hall witnessed one of the greatest motion pictures ever made.Coming from him, that was high praise indeed. And seeing the film now, restored for its video bow, we can appreciate his words. There are faults, to be sure, but basically it has to be admired for the innovative techniques it used in the art of animation. There are memorable sequences thanks to daring use of the multiplane camera: Snow White's flight through the woods, the Queen and her Magic Mirror, the Queen in the thunderous transformation scene as the camera seems to whirl around her, the Dwarfs in the mine and their march over the bridge as they sing \"Heigh-Ho\", the dwarfs chasing the witch in the thunderstorm. Even the rippling effects of the water in the wishing well scene.And, of course, there are the genuinely comic moments that made even the great Charlie Chaplin applaud in admiration. Dopey's antics are always a delight, as are Doc's and Grumpy's. All of the dwarfs are given inventive and funny things to do.The music is a standout: Someday My Prince Will Come, Heigh-Ho, I'm Wishing, The Yodel Song, etc. The young in heart will always love this classic. It belongs in the top tier of Disney's crown jewels, along with Pinocchio, Bambi, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella. Summing up: an inspired work of art on every level that will remain a timeless classic.",

            "content": "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)**** (out of 4) The beautiful and charming Snow White comes under attack by a man who has been hired by the evil Queen to kill her. She ends up taking shelter in the forest with seven dwarfs but soon the Queen has more plans to destroy her.There's no question that this is a legendary film and a very important one to history as it was the first feature-length film from Walt Disney Studios. The film was a tremendous hit when it was first released and it really broke new ground in regards to what people would be willing to sit through. After all, it was a mystery if people in 1937 would be willing to sit through a feature-length cartoon and whether or not they'd be able to show emotions towards animated characters.As for the film itself, it's certainly a great one from Disney's original Golden Age. There's no question that the most impressive thing is how great the actual animation is. I've seen plenty of cartoons from this era and the quality is usually good but there's no question that the amount of detail was just taken to a new level here. Just take a look at how much detail is in the forest scenes. Look at the detail to the seven dwarfs. Look at the terrific detail in the Queen's potions.SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS features a memorable and lovable lead character, a great villain and seven great comic relief characters. I also liked the fact that the darkness of the Grimm's Fairy Tale was also left in and this certainly makes the film more adult in a way. Disney would make a major breakthrough with this film and it remains refreshing all these years later.",

            "content": "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the very first animated film featured by Disney and one of the most charming. While it's a bit different from the original fairy tale, Walt Disney took this familiar classic and turned into a family film that is still talked about over 60 years later. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is such a charming film and is another example of beautiful animation and a terrific story that could charm it's way into your heart. I still enjoy watching this film to this day, who could love the seven dwarfs? They all were so funny to watch and are so memorable. They pretty much represent our moods, they're kinda like a mood ring that's put into one room, lol. But Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the perfect family film that is still holding up very well all these years.Snow White is a lovely princess who one day is just traveling through the forest. She comes across a house where it's a total mess, she decides to clean it as a favor to those who are living there. It turns out that seven dwarfs live there and when they find her, they realize they got a good thing going here, a hot girl who'll clean for them. But not everything is happy, the evil wicked queen wants to be the fairest in the land and Snow White has just beat her by a land slide. So she disguises herself as a witch and offers Snow White an apple, she eats it, and dies. Now the queen's the hottest girl in town, but the dwarfs come up with a clever plan to get her true love, the prince, he must kill the queen and save Snow White so they could live happily ever after.I'd say that's a nice summary, I try my best anyways. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is just one of the greatest Disney films ever made. It's such a charming film and is very much apart of our pop culture today and as far as films go, this is just a great one. I can't wait to show this to my kids one day, they'll probably laugh thinking how old this movie is that it's hand drawn, but I think that's what makes it so special. The voices, the songs, the animation, everything about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was just beautiful. I highly recommend this, it's a great family film.10/10",

I've read where it took somewhere between two to five years to make, and the artwork still stands up to today's standards. It still looks good, especially with today's DVD technology and great-looking television sets. This film, along with Bambi, exhibit some fantastic watercolor-type artwork with the latter being ever more spectacular than this one.The story is \"cute\" because of the seven dwarfs. The evil character - the queen - doesn't have that big a role so most of the time it's just a sweet, enjoyable film with nice characters. It's one of the those movies that makes you feel good as you are watching it.To be honest, some of the scenes lag a bit and Snow White's operatic voice is a bit much for me, but those are the only complaints I could find in this classic film, one of the best ever from Disney.",

            "content": "To call Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs a classic goes without saying that practically everyone has called it such. It is a great film, but there are certain factors that make it so, and without them the film could've gone the other way and become important more for its technical breakthrough(s) than for the content. The fact is a story with the utmost simplicity like Snow White, the chief characters- Prince Charming, the wicked Queen/witch, and of course Snow White- are all very basic, simple, if not one dimensional than basely two-dimensional characters. It's appropriate, to be sure, as it is based off a Grimm fairy tale. Despite the beauty and charm of the early scenes, its really on par entertainment-wise with the Silly Symphonies Walt Disney produced in the 30's. This also goes without saying that Snow White's run through the woods is one of the highlights of the film, still bringing a sense of terror and the surreal for the adults in the audience (if you're a little kid it could be one of the scariest things you've ever seen). But then- just as Snow White settles into her little 'hide-out' in a house she thinks occupied by messy, orphaned children- we're introduced to the seven dwarfs, and this is where the film picks up most of its energy, laughs, and complete and total balance. In a way, not to analyze too deep for a filmed fairy tale, they each represent the different sides of men, and so it gives the film the appropriate human dimensions it needs (in this, also setting up practically all the hand-drawn Disney films of the next seventy years or so). It's tempting to say which are my favorite, or whom I got the most enjoyment out of. There would be three, two for more obvious reasons, one for subtle ones.Dopey, who is almost a perfect re-incarnation (in Disney Dwarf form of course) of Harpo Marx- he's a lovable idiot, with barely two sounds in the course of the film, who (and I hate to sound sappy) brings out the laughing kid in anyone. Grumpy, who I found to be maybe the most complete character in the film, has attitude to spare, and gets comic bit after comic bit happen to him from the animators- and yet, there is heart behind him, and when its revealed in key parts of the film, they act as the most emotional points. There is also Sleepy, who also barely says a word, but who's physical movements are really divine little moments among the big, inspired musical numbers. Indeed, there are little moments throughout the film that help make up the greatness: the mood and atmosphere in the Queen's dungeon of witchcraft; the scene where the dwarfs go to sleep (a fly that rests on Sleepy's nose); the traits given to the animals in the forest (that little turtle is hilarious).All these parts help to add to the basic structure of the story- Queen wants the good looks, goes after her once the hunter fails, gives her the poison apple, then it goes even more predictable from their (though in a good way). The detail of the animated scenes, the backgrounds, the visual effects, are often mesmerizing. And the songs, which were some of the most standard I heard from the Disney oeuvre as a kid (they were always on those Disney 'Sing-along' videos) are still whimsical most of the time. Then there is also the icing on the cake- the voice of Snow White, Adriana Caselotti (who got contracted into this being her only film role, based of producer/uncredited director Disney's insistence), brings something to the film that's hard to describe, except to say that it's, well, serene.Even if she's not the strongest character, her main goal of making people around her feel good and inspiring happiness makes her watchable, and in a way lovable. It's a very curious, though important, factor that she (and Prince Charming and the Queen pre-witch) are animated very traditionally, apart from the cartoon-like dwarfs and animals. Its a reminder of the film's, and Disney's, strongest success- that as an imagined and visualized fairy tale, the representation is strong, and touching. In the new century studios move away from hand-drawn animated films, but it's a good idea to look back to the early Disney films, if not for just nostalgia (or to watch with your kids) to get a sense of the experimentation, the purity of it. It remains one of only several animated films, from any country or style, to have the crucial elements come together- music, voice-talent, usage of colors, and cinematography.",

            "content": "I loved this movie 10 years ago, and I still do. Sure it isn't the same as animation is now, but let's face it, most animation nowadays isn't very good. I can name a plethora of reasons why I love this movie. The animation is beautiful, with one or two stiff movements, but have a heart, it is the first Disney animation. The songs are mind-blowing, as well as the gorgeous incidental music(music similar to Great Expectations, 1946) that hardly anybody has mentioned. My favourite is \"Someday my Prince Will Come\", I cry every time I hear it. The characters are legendary, and the writing is top notch. Who can forget those adorable dwarfs, who added such a lot to this movie. Snow White is the weakest character but I like her innocence very much, and about her singing voice...it sounds weak, but in real life it must have been strong, and let me explain why. The colouratura soprano Amelita Galli-Curci was given the praise \"a beautiful and limpid voice\" yet I heard it on cassette and it sounds quite quiet. It has nothing to do with the size of the voice, but the quality of the recording. The best character was the wicked queen, who had the most classic animation scene I have ever seen... when she turns into a hag, which freaked me out big time when I was about 9, like Malificent from \"Sleeping Beauty.\" To me the Queen is probably one of the scariest Disney villains ever. The scene at Snow White's coffin was heart-rending, and it was the music that made it so. All in all, a beautiful, funny and touching movie, and I can't believe some people hated this. 10/10.

            "content": "Where would the animation world be without the humongous success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?  If the movie failed back in 1937, there would be no Disney Company today, no Lion King, and no Disneyland.  Disney's Folly, as critics first called it, would probably have scared any other industry from attempting such an ambitious and innovative project.  Pixar may not have ever had the chance to put out their groundbreaking features, and even the Disney- and fairy tale-bashing Shrek may never have been made if Snow White didn't set the course for the world of the animated feature.There must have been tremendous pressure on everyone involved in the making of Snow White, but they did not disappoint.  The end result includes a timeless story, classic songs, and beautiful imagery that will live on for future generations to enjoy.  In fact, this was only the second movie that captured my nieces' full attention spans (The Lion King being the first).In my opinion, the story was great but not perfect.  It's not as exciting or filled with as much witty remarks as today's animated features, but as soon as the dwarfs are introduced, the movie takes on an endearing lighter side. For the record, my favorite dwarf is Doc, because I can relate to him being a strong leader with some very humanistic follies, such as always getting tongue-tied (I do that myself all too often).  All the songs stand out in their own way.  `Some Day My Prince Will Come' is a classic, fairy-tale ballad.  `Heigh-Ho,' `Dig, Dig, Dig,' and `Whistle While You Work' are great songs to pick up your spirits when you have to go to work, do chores, or do homework.  And my favorite, `The Silly Song,' is just a great, catchy, and funny song.  As for the imagery, it's just breathtaking, especially considering how early it was introduced.  The colors are rich and lively, and the multi-plane camera does add some great depth to the movie.As you can tell, for an animation and Disney fan like myself, Snow White is a perfect milestone in the movie world.  Even compared to the animation and storytelling styles of today, Snow White still stands the test of time. Kudos to everyone involved in this picture as their work will live on forever.My IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A+ (Oscar-Worthy)",

            "content": "There isn't much that hasn't already been said about \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", Walt Disney's first feature length animated film. Suffice it to say that it not only fulfilled the studio's hopes beyond their wildest dreams, it made possible the Disney films that followed it. From the famous Grimm fairy tale about a beautiful princess who flees her jealous stepmother and finds refuge with seven friendly dwarfs, Walt Disney created a cinematic milestone. At the time the film was in production until the day it was released, rival producers were supposedly referring to it as \"Disney's Folly\".Although this myth has been recently debunked in film historian JB. Kaufman's magnificent new book (''The Fairest One Of All:The Making Of Walt Disney's Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs''Weldon Owen/Disney Press, 2012)it's true that only after it's huge success, did fellow movie makers attempt their own full-length cartoon features. Upon it's debut, at Hollywood's Carthay Circle theater, (December 21, 1937)the film was embraced both by critics and audiences, grossing many times it's then record (for an animated film) $1.5 million budget. Eight successful reissues have kept the movie in the public consciousness now for over six decades, during which time the field of animation has grown by leaps and bounds. Still. despite the cinematic advances and the passage of time, \"Snow White\" stands alone. While the classic story is but a framework for the film (a fact which troubled me for years), \"Snow White\" can be fully enjoyed for the pioneer it truly is. Along with a splendid cast of voices headed by Adriana Caselotti (Snow White) Harry Stockwell (father of Guy and Dean, as the Prince) and Lucille La Verne (The Queen), there are songs which can truly be called timeless: \"Whistle While You Work\", \"Heigh Ho\", \"Some Day My Prince Will Come\", etc.). Much time and effort went toward developing the characters of the Seven Dwarfs and giving each a distinct personality (absent in the original story) which went a long way in making audiences care for Snow White's plight. Interestingly enough, although the fairy tale was toned down considerably to make it more \"family friendly\", the overzealous way in which the film makers transformed the Wicked Queen into a hideous hag at the climax was the subject of an incredible amount of controversy at the time. In fact, it was under a partial ban in England which made it off-limits to children under 16 years of age! Nevertheless, it was the recipient of a special Academy Award in 1938.To go on about the impact made by the film would be redundant. It simply must be seen to be appreciated. In 2001, it was released on DVD as the first of Disney's \"Platinum Editions\". And many months before it was in stores, there was great speculation about the content. All the anticipation was justified when the DVD finally arrived. Critics and consumers were overwhelmed (just like the audiences back in 1937) with both the content and the painstaking restoration (beyond that done for it's 50th anniversary reissue) and made it THE DVD for the subsequent holiday season. Without going into detail, it looks as if it were made yesterday, and sounds better than a film of this vintage could ever be expected to. But the streamlining has not diminished it's charm--only accentuated it. And when you think (before you are drawn into the story, and you ARE) that \"Snow White\", unlike today's computer-drawn animated features was entirely done by hand, that makes it even more of a miracle.In one scene, when Snow White is scrubbing the steps of the Castle, and pours water from a bucket on them, the effect is remarkable-and that one, near the beginning, is just one small sample of the film's artistry.Back to the DVD. Instead of listing the already well publicized bonus features, let me say that this \"Platinum Edition\" is like a self-contained history of the film, with hours worth of delights the most astounding being a pieced-together commentary by Walt Disney himself. Out of print for years, it is well worth the effort and expense to find. And although Disney made it a point to announce that they planned to go even further with their subsequent \"Platinum Editions\", they have yet to top this one. And I doubt they ever will. Incidentally, this year marks the film's 75th anniversary, and I can think of no better way to celebrate this movie milestone than picking up Professor Kaufman's beautiful new books The second volume '' Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs:The Art And Creation Of Walt Disney's Classic Animated film''is also published by Weldon Owen/Disney Press.It's a very extensive and fully detailed catalog of the ''Snow White'' exhibition,(currently at the Walt Disney museum in San Francisco,California).Here, the emphasis is more on the beautiful art as well as rough sketches and background paintings. Along with it's companion book ''The Fairest One Of All'' it will educate and enchant anyone who cares about the history of Film, Disney Animation and especially ''Snow White'' They are, without a doubt,the definitive tributes to a Timeless Classic, and together, they make perfect souveniers for both the film's 75th Anniversary and and a once in a lifetime event.",

My mom took my sister and me to see it at our little home town theater. I have to tell you, those things they say about Disney and little kids are true. I have never seen anything since that affected me as profoundly. There was the sense of evil. The Queen with the mirror. The fact that she is sending a child into the woods to be killed. My gosh. I'm five years old and a child is about to be murdered. Then there are those little guys, each with a character trait to match his name. The story is one of vengeance. The queen transforming herself and then going on the prowl with those apples. The scene of her death is horrible. And then there is a death experience. She lies in that crystal coffin. Will she be OK? Everyone was crying in the theater. And then, of course, the prince comes along. It's just a masterful telling of a simple tale with memorable characters, violence, and purification through suffering. When Grumpy cries...well I tell you.There are things in my life that I am so grateful for. Walt Disney's empire may be the most overwhelming in entertainment.

            "content": "Before Cinderella lost her slipper and before Aladdin met the Genie, Walt Disney did his most crazy and insane project ever - a feature animated movie, the first of its kind. The title of the film is Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Parents and kids loved this film decades ago and, a generation later, families can now enjoy this beautiful classic in Blu-Ray.Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a musical with catchy, and beautiful singing done by Adriana Caselotti, (Snow White), Lucille La Verne (Queen) and others. There is also a sense of adventure, and a magical romance, between Snow White and the Prince.The story begins when the Queen discovers that she is not the fairest of them all, and that Snow White is. Out of jealousy, she orders the death of Snow White. However, Snow White gets away. She comes upon 7 dwarfs which she befriends. The Queen angrily learns about her failed death, and decides to poison the young princess!Since this is the Diamond Edition of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, it is packed with extra features including a tour of the animation studios in the 1930s, actual interviews with Walt Disney, cool facts, (Did you know Snow White was originally designed to have gold hair? Who knew!) and so much more. My favorite part concentrates on how Walt Disney hired over 300 artists, how he spent so much money on making it perfect, and just how much speculation and hate he got for attempting to make (and being very successful as a result) a 90 minute animated film.Even though this film was made almost a century ago, the quality of the animation is as good as films made today. Hand-drawn animation has a quality of from the human touch that CGI can never achieve. In terms of the soundtrack, Walt Disney had a knack for making his animated films not only have background music, but he created it in such as way that the music becomes an integral part of the story. For example, when Snow White and the Prince first meet, they sing a song together and it represents almost, \"Instant love,\" better than words ever could. This story is based on a classic European fairy tale, and Walt Disney hired a few people who specifically made European-styled drawings, to make the film feel like the original fairy tale, which was perfect for the film. The voice-over sound quality is also top notch, amazingly so since again, it was made almost 100 years ago. I would easily compare it to the voice over acting and quality of the late 90s. This film was ambitious in terms of being the first animated feature film, but also was first feature film to have a female lead.My favorite scene is the meeting of The Prince and Snow White. In the scene, Snow White is cleaning outside and she explains to her bird friends what a wishing well is. A prince overhears her fantastic singing and is love-struck when he meets her. This scene is one of my favorites because the music is beautiful, the animation is spectacular and this scene specifically illustrates my point about European artists designing the backgrounds. It really looks like a European castle of some sort.This film was designed for all ages and I still agree. I recommend it for ages 6 to 13 specifically. Younger kids will enjoy the bright colors, dancing and singing. Older kids can appreciate how difficult it was to make this film and the storyline itself. Adults who have happy memories of seeing this film years ago will also enjoy it. Overall, it's a great film for the family. I rate it 5 out of 5 stars because of the spectacular animation, exciting story (typical of films made by Walt Disney) and clear voice acting.",

Although much of the praise this film receives, may be due to the fact that it was it's creator's first attempt at an animated feature, I think it's obvious merits and artistic triumphs are enough to maintain it's place at the top.First, there is the artwork, which is stunning. The color isn't at it's most vibrant, such as with, say, \"Cinderella\" (1950), but it is suitable and lovely all the same. A virtual watercolor painting come to life. The details in the animation never fail to amaze. Just look at the raindrops in the chase sequence towards the end. Look how they hit the rocks, and slip away. Such attention to detail was rarely matched in an animated feature, except maybe, in \"Pinocchio\" (1940).The characters are of various degrees of interest, with Snow White, probably the least of these. The dwarfs are all charming, and it is they who carry the film during their screentime with the princess. However, one should not deny, that the true star of this film, is the evil queen. Both in her presence of glamour, and in her transformation as an old crone, she is fascinating to watch. I don't believe another Disney villian has ever been both frightening and enchanting, like she has.Lastly, the music in this film is truly memorable. The \"Heigh Ho\" sequence is visually impressive, and the dwarfs song as they bathe is a great comedy bit. Not to mention Snow White's anthem \"Someday My Prince Will Come\"; another gem in the Disney library. All in all, a tremendous production. Beautiful, thrilling, and memorable.",

            "content": "There are just some things you just can't beat and Disney's version of Snow White still can hold its own to many other animated fairy tale films that are being put out today. In this animated feature film, there is absolutely nothing that any viewer can't adore. The main premise of Snow White is still the same; the queen wants her dead and she wishes to be the fairest of them all. But in Disney's first ever to be released film, there are a few other added ideas to the story that make it a true Disney treasure.Let's begin with the characters first. Adriana Caselotti plays the voice of Snow White. Caselotti's voice, when it is either singing or just talking, is wholesomely beautiful, sweet and cute and matches the way her character is drawn quite nicely. It is by far, one of the most amiable voices a viewer could hear. As for the Queen/Witch who tries to have Snow White killed, is voiced by Lucille La Verne. She too makes her character very memorable. Her cackle as the witch sent chills up my spine.As Snow White flees from the Queen she also befriends a large amount of the forest animals; which all have the ability to some how understand her. But I really don't care because it is just as amazing to watch this movie now as it was for the viewers of 1937. But the supporting characters that everyone loves and remembers the most are the seven dwarfs voiced by multiple radio sensations of the time. And the great thing is, every fan has seven dwarfs to pick from to be the one they cherish the most. My favorite is bashful, just for being...well bashful. Tying his beard into knots and such. What a goofball hahahaha.The other two great elements in this picture are the musical numbers and the animation. Whatever made the animation the way it was for its time, is truly something. I can't put my finger on it, but the animation is made in a way that not many other films were made in this category. This is probably due to the technology of the time. But none the less, this creates a nostalgic feel to the film. The same goes for the background music composed by Paul L. Smith.Finally, along with Smith's score, are the musical numbers the characters perform. If it's the \"Whistle While You Work\", \"Heigh-Ho\", \"I'm wishing\" or any other song I can think of, all have really fun tunes and leave a lasting impression. Plus, they are fun to join in and sing along with as well. A very interactive film for its time and did wonders for Walt Disney's business. You just can't beat a classic like this one.The Disney version of the Grimm brothers' fairy tale is colorful in animation, as are its musical numbers and lively characters. A true sense in the word classic.",

            "content": "It's spellbinding! I've just watched Snow White for the umpteenth time, and decided it's still as wondrous and lustrous as ever. The music, humour, and animation are stuck magically in the 1930's but it all seems as timeless as the story itself. The best place to see it is in a cinema of course, the same as my daughter and I did over and over again before Disney released it on video in '94.All available positive epithets (magnificent, amazing, stupendous etc) apply to this one, nearly a 10 in my book. For good or bad SW will never be surpassed, because of capitalist pressures to ensure everything makes money: animation designed and drawn by human beings has lost out to the precise but soulless computer. Ditto music with tunes and marvellous lyrics played well. Gentle humour that the entire family can appreciate has given way to appreciation of smut and cynicism. And that's just Disney! My favourite bits: The song \"Wishing\", and looking up the well at SW; the dwarfs first seeing her SW in their beds asleep; the dwarfs' washing sequence and song. The only thing I never liked was the apparently rushed ending - the dwarfs are looking after SW's \"inanimate\" body through the seasons, this handsome guy comes along, kisses her and they both skedaddle into the massive sunset at warp speed! I think I wanted it to last another couple of hours.Overall, to my feeble mind this is High Art! Highbrows probably don't like it because it was charming and incredibly popular, so does any normal person in the world dislike this film, and if so, why?",

The Queen asks everyday to to her trusted enchanted mirror who always replies that she is until one day another name is given.What I enjoy about Walt Disney's classic fairy tale is true beauty comes from within. The Queen is stunningly beautiful, but on the inside an ugly witch who wants nothing more then to destroy her step daughter who was pretty within, caring and sensitive. Snow White cares for the men who took her in, cleans their house, cooks dinner and pumps them up everyday before they go off to work in the diamond mines while her mother takes life for granted. The visuals are stunning, the music enchanting and the characters enduring making it a true testament to filmaking with limited technology available at the time.A problem I had with the story itself is the prince who was the only one not fleshed out or given personality and only there to serve as a love interest. He's bland, boring and perfect without any flaws making the romance feel a little rushed. The first half was exciting as Snow runs for her life, meeting her prince and the huntsmen's death, but it mellows out once she reaches the closet stuck with chores to do.I was captivated by the evilness the Queen displayed with her suave body language, her shivering crackle and frightening transformation into an old hag straight out of tales from the crypt. While there have been complaints from special interest groups on the artist merit of the picture and its portrayal of women I found her to be the most courageous, brave and daring of them all.",

As such, it opened up new ground, established some of the formulas we still see today in animated films and is still darned entertaining. Had there been an IMDb back in 1937, I surely would have scored this one a 10--no doubt about that. However, despite being one of my favorite and sweetest Disney films, I also have to admit that the film, though wonderful, does suffer a bit on two accounts. First, Snow White's voice and singing is hellishly awful. What was wonderful for 1937 is just cringe-worthy today. Second, the ending is very abrupt and lacks depth. Still, the animation is wonderful, the story terrific and the film is easy to love. If you don't love this one, then you must be insane or just plain evil!",

It should also be pointed out that, for all of the adorable animals and dwarfs, there are some genuinely spooky parts, too. Snow White fleeing through the shadowy forest is possibly my favorite scene of the whole movie. The Queen's ultimate fate is also quite dark. It's really a terrific film.

Snow White, cut loose from the castle, stumbles upon a hut where seven dwarves are living - which is where the Queen comes for her, in disguise, with a poison apple...This has classic written all over it. Disney's first major feature, the grand debut, cements the major features of those to come. It draws from very dark but fantastic material, Grimm's Fairy Tales, and alternates scenes of evocative darkness (the Queen's castle, the man sent to cut Snow White's heart out, and the forest that's alive, are some brilliant examples) with scenes of superlative cuteness and song and dance numbers.\nDrawbacks:There are some beautiful compositions, but the movement of the animation is not as fluid as it would become, even with Pinnochio, Disney's very next feature. Plus, the singing styles are very 1930's opera-style. I can see why i always used to just think of songs during musicals as things i had to wait through till the story got going again - its because almost every song in Snow White doesn't advance the story. Great musical numbers, like the ones in West Side Story, do. They don't feel like we're just waiting around. When most of the Snow White songs come on, the story gets put on hold.Snow White is too naive, plain and perfect a character to hold our interest these days. Contemporary audiences just don't worship \"perfect\" people like this. Plus, the attempts at animation of real people is not good. Snow White and the Prince in particular just don't work - whereas the cartoony dwarves really come alive. Try watching her face when she talks.Highlights:All of the Queen's scenes are absolute gems, actually. And the dwarves are great. Seven great characters.One of the best things Disney ever did was the Queen's angry walk down the staircase to the dungeon, and her subsequent making of a potion to transform herself into an old witch. The way the liquid she's mixing comes alive is fantastic, and the close-ups on the crow sitting on the skull are a nice touch.The poison flooding towards the centre of the pot, engulfing the apple, and the jack o'lantern face on it afterwards.Some of Disney's most classic songs come from Snow White: Whistle While You Work, Heigh Ho (its off to work we go), and one of the most beautiful Disney songs ever, Some Day My Prince Will Come.There's also a very memorable piece of theme music that plays during the climactic storm scene.10/10.

            "content": "The Walt Disney Studios went a long way towards earning its nickname of The Magic Kingdom with the release of Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs. There will never be another version of the beloved Grimm Brothers fairy tale because you couldn't find all the elements that make this one work so well.I imagine that with today's computer generated graphics you could come up with a more realistic animation. But it would probably frighten the children and in all the wrong places. More than the wicked queen would be frightening folks.Snow White is a tale of imagination, something that lets the kids work their minds and really get into the characters. The voices selected so perfectly match the animated figures. And with the exception of Billy Gilbert they're not known players. Snow White is first and foremost a character driven story. Today the Disney Studio would probably take from their stable of TV and film personalities for voices, but the emphasis would be on the celebrities not the story. I don't think Disney Studios alone would be guilty of that however.Much as I like the simple story, the thing I love best about the film is the musical score that Frank Churchill and Larry Morey wrote. This is the Annie Get Your Gun of animated films, so many different and beloved hits come out of it. Even today you can hear people offhandedly humming 'Heigh Ho, Heigh Ho' and they might not realize where it's from, it's so ingrained in our consciousness, almost like Happy Birthday.A favorite song of mine is the operatic ballad One Song that the prince and Snow White both sing. I have a recording of it that Allan Jones did and it's a gem. It could have come out of a score by Sigmund Romberg or Rudolf Friml, it's that good.The movie DVD is still a hot seller, it's like White Christmas and the other Christmas songs that Bing Crosby did which still keep his name before the public every Yuletide season and keeps making money for his estate. Why is Snow White so popular? Very simply it's one of the best cartoon features every made.",

I guess that I don`t have to tell you much about the story, since most of you are familiar with it, but I`ll tell you some of it(in case some of you have missed out on this classic). Snowwhite(a princess) is the most beautiful woman in the country, which her stepmother(the queen) doesn`t like.  The queen orders her best hunter to kill Snowwhite when she is picking flowers.  The hunter is not able to kill Snowwhite, and she runs deeper into the forest.  The eventually discovers a small house, which is the dwarfs` house.  The queen finds out that Snowwhite is still alive. Snowwhite is a true classic, with superb animation and stunning soundtrack. It was also a groundbreaking movie, which meant that Disney could produce more high-class cartoon-movies to an audience which was gasping for more. 9,5/10",

            "content": "For all its historical importance, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) is not treated well by most Disney fans. It is tolerated, but not respected or loved. Common complaints fall upon the heroine being too passive, the music being too dated, too much padding, etc. No film is perfect, even great films, but my God, people are too harsh on this one.No other Disney film possesses the innocence of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It has a freshness, an excitement to it. It's as though you could feel the animators' joy in every frame. There is no hip irony or cynicism on display, no need to be subversive or cool. The whole thing is a fairy tale played straight and with tons of heart. It isn't hard to see why weary Depression audiences so readily took it to their hearts and declared it \"the happiest thing since Armistice\".Snow White is not complex or super interesting as a character, but she has more of a personality than she is given credit for. She is also tougher than you'd think: she's a young teenage girl from an abusive home, yet she still believes she should keep a positive view of life and tries her best to stay optimistic through all her troubles. That's admirable. As for her warbling soprano, many will not favor it and yes, it is dated. However, don't be too harsh there. After all, I doubt the modern pop hit \"Let It Go\" in Frozen (2013) will gracefully age either.Of course, the dwarfs are all lovable and entertaining. The Queen/Witch is chilling, one of the finest Disney villains. The Prince... well, he's rather dull. Honestly, I don't get the criticism of Snow's supposed lack of personality; she has it all over her prince.The animation is still beautiful, even if there are a few awkward moments due to rotorscoping and experimentation. The muted color scheme is lovely, a great contrast to the exhausting bright colors which saturate modern animation (I mainly think of the garish Hercules (1997) or The Lorax (2012)). The backgrounds give one the impression of a children's storybook come to life.Overall, this is a great film and we are still feeling its influence (for better or worse, since American animation is rarely allowed to leave the Snow White model). Without a doubt, it deserves more respect from modern audiences.",

As a kid, I had wanted to watch this movie in its entirety for the longest time, and didn't get a chance to see it until it was released on video, finally, in the 1990s.This film was better than I had expected, with catchy and sweet music (especially the Dwarf's Silly Song), memorable characters and beautiful sceneries and animation. This is what I think the best adaptation of this classical fairytale. Songs that you grew up with were probably introduced in this movie like Heigh-Ho and Whistle While You Work.This story really portrays the gentleness, kind-heartiness, beauty and innocence of Snow White and the silliness, humor, yet selfless characteristics of the Seven Dwarfs. The movie also did a good job in portraying the mystery, eerie and horror surrounding the Evil Queen and her chamber full of black magic. The design for the Queen and the Magic Mirror is the best in any adaptation of this fairytale - animated or in real life.This is the perfect film to start off a long list of Disney's Full Length Animated Feature Films. When comparing this film and the more current ones, you can see how far these films have come and the difference in style. While some of the newer films are great, others are sub-par, and none can surpass those films, including this one, that had Walt Disney's personal touch.If you are a Disney fan or an animation/family movie genre fan in general, this movie is a must-see for you.Grade A",

            "content": "I have a lot of complaints about Disney; what he made personally and the lumbering beast his studio has become.In particular, he murdered one of the most precious literary structures we have in Alice. But in his first big project, he did well enough to change the world. In its day, this was a rule- changer, the Star Wars of its day. Everything that happened afterward was different. Many people credit the characterizations, which Disney never did as well afterward, creating a vacuum for Pixar to fill. I admit that except for the \"swallow the soap\" trick, I liked that element.But I think there is something more fundamental at work. Movies are basically about visual notation. Its less about what the stories are than how they are told. One of the evolutions that I track is the business of outside awareness. But this, I think is something different, sort of in the opposite direction. We had comics before, where objects were not masses but boundaries. We had cartoons before, where large blobs of grey and then color defined shapes that we assigned identities to. But this has two things. They were revolutionary.The first is the narrative long form. It isn't complex; it has only one arc. We even know what the arc is and how it will end, the only mystery (for the original viewers) being in the cinematics of the thing. Disney would stumble later, on understanding the nature of long form storytelling but here he does what must have seemed impossible.The second is more visual. At the time, this seemed more natural and organic than anything that had gone before (except for the Prince \u0097 Disney always has trouble with men). We focus on the dwarfs, but the girl has mannerisms that are beyond anything we had seen before, the best being Betty Boop before the censors intervened.But there's something deeper, and to explain it, we need some history. Light is magical. Reflected light isn't very special, light like you see bouncing off a magazine page. The colors you see are dimmer than real world colors because of the strength of the light of course, but what you see is what is not absorbed. You see the leftovers. In stained glass, the light comes through, directly from the source. The colors you see are more vibrant. Ancient glassmasters formulated glass that the moderns do not, so if you have a chance to see one (like the Tree of Jesse in Chartres) you will see millions of facets in each color because of the way that the color was layered on in a \"flashing\" process, creating refractive crystal boundaries.These windows are a profound experience because of this scintillation effect that is subliminal. Like these old cartoons, the beings and objects are blobs of shimmering color with outlines that infer identity. Its a deep art that exists no where else, and not even since in stained glass.Now another fact. Snow is not white. Snow is a collection of ordered microcrystals that refract light in all colors. The combined effect adds to white, but as you move ever so slightly, you will be receiving millions of millions of flashes of pure color. And now a final fact. In 1952, when I saw this on a huge screen, the screen technology involved faceted grains of silica that had this snow-effect of micro-refraction. Today's screens use microspheres, tiny balls with smooth surfaces, so the effect is not the same. And obviously digital screens are another matter. They all preserve this \"transmitted light\" effect of stained glass, as do all films. (But the new mastering of the cartoon for DVD does increase the purity of the colors, emphasizing the stained glass semiotics.)I recently saw this on DVD, and was instantly reminded of the viewing 55 years ago, which washed over with a blizzard of snow scintillations with medieval weight, both in the story and the stained glass. I've never lost that thrill, and I wish it for you. This changed me and it changed film.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this.",

I also acknowledge that it has its flaws--Snow White's submissive character and her squeaky voice are often criticized. I also don't think the songs are that great, but where I will defend this movie is in its storytelling. Yes, it is a very simple plot, but that is its strength. It relies on visuals and keeps things uncomplicated, which means that very young children can understand some of the action, even if they aren't able to follow the entire story arc. It's the same reason that the first half of Wall-E gets so much praise. Both have breathtaking visuals, also--they way that Snow White and the witch move is actually more interesting to watch, for me, than almost anything else in animation. I think I read somewhere that they were rotoscoped, which is a process that has been used before and since, but for me, this is the pinnacle of what the technique can do.So many of the animated movies of the last 20 years are filled with adult-level in-jokes, sarcastic sidekicks, and rapid-fire pacing that plays to short attention spans. It would be nice to have more stories that didn't try to be so full of irony, and instead focus on the things that make a story truly timeless.",

            "content": "Disney has made many animated feature films, and there are still animated movies aplenty being made out there in modern times, but very few can eclipse the very first one of all, which is the story of a beautiful young princess called Snow White who is under the watch of the wicked Queen, who forces her as a maid in the house. This movie is now so highly rated and acclaimed that in 2007, the American Film Institute named this animated flick the 34th best American film of ALL TIME.Even while watching it as a little kid, watching it again as a grown up teenager still brings back awesome memories, proving that the story, the characters and beautiful music is gripping and makes this a fascinating tale. Snow White herself is drawn so beautifully that you can't help but simply admire her, and the incredibly adorable voicing from Adriana Caselotti is a child's fascination. The Seven Dwarfs are very united and usually do things together- they live together, work together etc. But they are all different in personality and even in appearance. One example is Grumpy, who is for a while reluctant to accept Snow White and cold towards her, but is still one to play a part to rescue her from the Queen when danger arrives. They are the other backbone of the story, and are my personal favourite in this.This one animated film has received a lot of praise and attention over the years, right up until now 3 quarters of a century later, because by 1937 standards this is just phenomenal. Kudos Walt Disney for having the far-sightedness and innovation to create this stupendous movie in Technicolor back then and making it fun and realistic. Even now, all children should watch this- perhaps even with their parents who will not mind it!",

I still love this movie after all these years.The seven dwarfs are cute, comical and each of them as cuddly as a teddy bear - including Grumpy! Without the comic relief of the dwarven the movie would be a good drama.Snow White has all the inner and outer beauty that a person could hope for. She's cheerful, helpful, charming, polite, friendly and fun. Quite a nice character.Queen Grimhilde is the picture of all vanity. She wants to be the only beautiful woman in the kingdom. She is quite beautiful on the outside but she lacks the inner beauty that Snow White has which makes her more angry and jealous at Snow.Prince Florian is a dashing and daring guy who has his eyes on the beautiful Snow White. Prince Florian is another \"Prince Charming\" and our hero of the film.Yes this is a great Walt Disney classic that should be seen if only once in you lifetime.10/10",

But an animated princess (or a live-action one) needs no certain fan age group, and this is the film that started it all, Snow White.Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is based on the German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm. It was the Walt Disney Studios' first full-length animated feature film, as well as the first American animated feature film in film history. The story is a familiar one: Raised by a wicked and vain queen after her royal parents died, beautiful Snow White is taken into the forest to be murdered. However, the huntsman cannot commit the horrible deed, so she flees and finds refuge in the home of seven diamond-mine workers/dwarfs: Doc, Happy, Bashful, Sneezy, Sleepy, Grumpy, and Dopey.My favorite musical scenes are the wishing well/balcony scene and the \"Bluddle-Uddle-Um-Dum\" scene. To me, that washing scene is like teaching cats to wash like humans instead of using their tongues. So overall, I love this beautifully animated film from beginning to end.",

            "content": "Before the beginning of the World War II in the 1940s, an entertainment industry was born and while most of the movies were made in the early 1910s and 1920s, a man named Walt Disney and several of his workers created a company known as the Walt Disney Company, a light-hearted entertainment industry, by releasing their very first animated full length feature, \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" based on the Grimm fairy tale of the same name.It tells the story about Snow White, a girl dressed rags who meets a prince. The queen, after becoming jealous of her beauty which will result in taking the queen's place as ruler of the kingdom, sends his huntsman to take her far into the forest where he can kill her. When he tried to kill her, he apparently lets her go after telling her of the Queen's plan. She runs into a forest, but after making some encounters with some forest friends, they take her to a cottage where she along with the animals clean it up. Little does Snow White know that this cottage belongs to the seven dwarf men, who then find her and decided to make friends with her and let her stay for as long as she likes. Meanwhile, the Queen, having found out the Snow White is still alive, transforms herself into an old hag and makes a poison apple so she can give it to her and will result in sleeping death.For their first attempt at an animated feature that will lead to their success and create other classics, Disney has done a fantastic job and to me, I remembered watching this as a child and it finally grew out on me which is why I'm giving this a full 100%. The story is very original with an emotional feeling to it and the pacing is really good with some scenes that aren't drag. The characters are extremely likable. Snow White, although the weakest of the other Disney princess, is at least decent, the prince only appears in the beginning and the end, but was OK. The seven dwarfs are so funny. Doc, Happy, Sleepy, Grumpy, Happy, Dopey, and Sneezy are great and the hilarious moments with them are enjoyable to watch, but the only character who steals the show the most is the Queen who is by far a great Disney villain. Her motives are excellent and her old hag form scared the living soul out of me as a child. The voice acting for the characters are what I would like to say \"excellent\", but the strongest aspects goes to the memorable songs (I'm Wishing, Whistle While You Work, Heigh Ho, The Silly Song, Someday My Prince Will Come) and the beautiful animation I've ever seen in any film out there today.Overall, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs will always remain to Disney-fans as one of the most classic films in cinema history before MGM would later do the same thing by making The Wizard of OZ, an adaptation of L. Frank Baum's classic book. This deserves a higher thumbs up from me!",

            "content": "Having just picked up quite possibly the last copy of the recent Diamond Edition of this film, and watching for the first time in 15 years, I am compelled to write this review. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is 74 years old this year, and it doesn't feel like it has aged a bit. What everyone thought would be a flop is the reason we have the likes of Pinocchio (1940), Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), The Lion King (1994), Toy Story (1995) and Tangled (2011). This film blew away audiences back then, being hailed as one of the greatest cinematic achievements and even being proclaimed the greatest film of all time by Russian director Sergei M. Eisenstein. The amazing thing is, Snow White blew people away when it was re-released in 2001 in the Platinum Edition, reminding people that the older Disney movies are timeless, and will never be topped.Adapted from the Grimm Fairytale and made family-friendly, Snow White follows the story of...Snow White (Adriana Caselotti), who is proclaimed the \"fairest of them all,\" much to the distaste of her stepmother, The Queen (Lucille La Verne). A hunter is hired to take Snow White out into the woods and kill her, returning her heart to The Queen as proof, but having a change of heart, lets Snow White escape. She stumbles across an old house in the woods, which houses seven dwarfs.The re-master is gorgeous, highlighting just how beautiful the animation is, and why hand-drawn will always be the best. The animals are cute as ever, the \"evil woods\" scene looks stunning, The Queen's transformation still frightening, and the final scene in the storm is just as epic as it was when I was five! I forgot just how many fantastic musical numbers this movie had, with \"Whistle While you Work,\" \"Heigh Ho\" and \"Someday My Prince Will Come\" sounding as good as ever.This film spawned some of the greatest family films of all time, with Pinocchio, Bambi, Dumbo and Fantasia following straight after Snow White's success. As a 20 year old guy, I thought the magic may have worn off, but this film is a lasting legacy, a testament to the brilliance of these old Disney films. Watching this again, I found myself smiling at the antics of the dwarfs, singing to songs I'd long forgotten, and crying with the dwarfs over Snow White's body. Snow White has managed to enchant audiences for 74 years, and will continue doing so for as long as I can imagine.5/5",

            "content": "Disney's \"Snow White\" was the very first full length animated film and without it, we most likely would have never had the classics that came years after.Snow White lives in a castle with her stepmother who is jealous of her stepdaughter's beauty and wishes to kill her so she will become \"the fairest of them all.\" Snow White runs away into the forest and comes across the cottage of the seven Dwarfs and they agree to let her stay but the Queen decides to take care of Snow White herself upon discovering that she is still alive and living with the seven dwarfs.For starters, the animation is fantastic and you can only imagine how long it must have taken the animators to draw out one frame alone. The studio was also used to animating characters in a silly style like Mickey Mouse at the time and the training they went through shows how determined Walt Disney was to make this film happen especially considering he put a mortgage on his house to get the money to make the film and would have ended up homeless if it failed.The voice cast is also fantastic, especially upon learning that this was Adrianna Caselotti's first role in a motion picture. Most modern Disney fans criticise her voice for Snow White and label it \"annoying\" but I feel the voice fits the character perfectly since Snow White is 14 years old in the film. Lucille La Verne is also great as the Queen and captures the wicked nature of her cruel intentions perfectly.Many also complain about the changes from the source material despite the fact that not everything from a book can be adapted into a film. I feel that making Snow White 14 in the film instead of 7 like in the original tale was a better choice as seeing a child go through certain events in the film such as the forest scene may have been traumatising.Overall, this is one of the studios best animated features with impressive animation, a great cast of voices and is the reason why we have the classics we know and love today.",

            "content": "Before Snow White, animation was three minutes of motion as chickens sang, cows and dogs played instruments and all to tinny pre-school music. For this film, the animators under Walt Disney's supervision had to create an entirely new process, they had to create not just well-rounded characters but they had to reinvent an entirely new film method of language in order to design a film literally from scratch.It wasn't enough to simply put together a cohesive story. The world inside Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is populated in every inch of the screen with supporting characters: rabbits, birds, turtles, deer, skunks, chipmunks, squirrels, mice, etc. They packed the frame so that everything is always in motion and we are never faced with any negative space. Where most films are interested in the two or four characters in the center, the animator's genius was to create a population, a full-rounded world that suggested that space existed just off camera. That, in our minds, creates an orientation of three-dimensional space onto a film that doesn't have any. Live action films always have space off-camera, but in animation, it doesn't exist.The technological marvel was the multi-plane camera which allowed objects in the foreground and the background to move independently of one another and independently of the central action. It also allowed the objects in the frame to move at various speeds and various distances to create a three-dimensional feel. This was long before computers, when animation was a painstaking practice in which each cell was drawn and painted one-by-one by hand (production on this film actually began in 1934). On the multi-plane camera, pieces of the artwork were lain on various platters on the camera that moved independently of one another so the various cells could move opposite of one another. The result was that a house in the background could have objects moving independently in the foreground.The animators had the talent to create a palette that was alive. Take, for example, Snow White's nightmare journey through the forest as the branches of the trees reach out and the eyes bear down upon her. It would be enough just to have a girl frightened by the forest but to see it through her eyes to visualize the nightmare is part of the extra step, the further burst of inspiration. It wasn't entirely necessary to give the trees eyes or to draw them in such detail that they have twisted, angry faces, but it adds a level of generosity to the visuals.But the palette would be nothing without expressive characters to put in front of it. The seven dwarfs have faces that are expressive, with big eyes, wide mouths and soft-round bodies, much like a child. And with the details in character design, they were also infused with emotions. Take for example the scene in which the dwarfs mourn for Snow White, their teary faces hung down in true expression. It would be one thing if the dwarfs simply cried, but note how the light and shadow play across their sad faces. No two characters are alike, no two characters move alike. There's real sadness in that scene. The whole movie is like that. The Dwarfs are seen as individuals, and we can easily tell them apart by more than their names and corresponding tics. The same can be said for the wicked queen, whose face glows with stunning beauty and whose disguise, an old crone, is round and somewhat inviting (we can understand the trap that Snow White falls into).Ironically, the least impressive characters are Snow White and Prince Charming. They look and act and movie with such realism that they aren't quite as interesting. How would Snow White have lasted in history if the Disney animators had given her more animated dimension, more to the tone of the dwarfs? And despite the title, the dwarfs and the evil Queen actually dominate the picture. They are so exaggerated that they have more room to play. The Queen too has exaggerated movements but only after she is transformed into the old crone.What Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs offers is the full experience of what the canvas of an animated feature can do. It explores a storytelling medium that would be severely limited in a live-action movie and frees it up to expand imagination. Others have come along and others have done better, but Snow White came first and it's was a major step from what had come before. What genius. What generosity of the visuals. What imagination.",

            "content": "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a Walt Disney production based on Snow White by The Brothers Grimm. The rest, as they say, is history. Famously said to be Disney's folly prior to release, Snow White has gone on to be one of the company's biggest earners; few, if anyone, can deny it's not the most deserving from Disney's back catalogue of being released every once in a while on different home formats. Very much a landmark movie for being the first full length animated feature, it also deserves its accolades for the high artistic quality that seeps from every frame. The advancements from Steamboat Willie ten years earlier are nothing short of incredible, the richness of the animation is a joy to behold, as the woodland creatures dart about with purpose, or the way the terror comes to life as Snow White runs thru the forest, the depth and clarity dazzles the eyes. Then of course there's the songs, most of which have formed part of pop culture ever since they were first heard. \"Whistle While You work,\" \"Heigh-Ho\" and \"Someday My Prince Will Come,\" each one a standard uplifter on a dreary day. That the film is accessible to all ages obviously helped it gain universal appeal. Yes, very young kids are quite easily spooked by the darker moments that lay within, but around the corner is a treat, most notably in the form of 7 little dwarfs, each one with an identity and character that the young and old can fully embrace. One of the finest quotes I can remember about the dwarfs came from Charlie Chaplin, who straight out insisted that Dopey was \"one of the greatest comedians of all time\", and he's right of course. True enough it has some minor rough edges that time has inflicted upon it. Snow White is voiced by Adriana Caselotti, her voice is very 30s, very shrill and much too childlike for a character meant to be a young woman. Whilst she's not exactly painted in a good light, bit of an air-head is our Snow White, but to do down the film for its social portrayal of women in the late 30s would be churlish in the extreme!Pixar, presently, keeps raising the bar, as computer-perfection-animation thrills the modern day crowd. But make no bones about it, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is still the benchmark animation movie. As technical advancements ensure we are wowed by this particular art form, Disneys folly watches over proceedings as the rightful lord of the manor. Masterpiece 10/10",

Seriously, by any standard, it's stood the test of time beautifully and it's a wonderful piece of cinema.The story we should all know. You have Princess Snow White - perhaps the most stunning cartoon woman ever? Not only is she beautiful, but she's extremely lovely and pleasant. If she existed, she'd be the next Princess Diana or Mother Teresa. It seems that everyone who meets her grows soon enough to adore her. But not everyone loves our dear Princess. Her wicked step-mother hates her and is terribly jealous of her. That's because Snow White is thought to be the 'fairest in the land'. So the Queen plans to have her killed by a Huntsman. When this plan fails, Snow White runs away and finds a place to stay - the house of 7 utterly lovable dwarfs! In a short time, they are completely crazy about her and love having her around. She's the ideal woman! But the Queen discovers her plan has failed and decides to take matters into her own hands...It's a very simple but thoroughly captivating story. The characters are superb and wildly likable. They are marvellously given life by the great work of the cartoonists and the actors who voiced them. This is an excellent collection of some very fine voice actors, especially Adriana Caselotti as Snow White. She sings like an angel and her innocent voice is very lovely indeed. The music is well suited to the story and memorable, particularly the infamous 'Hi Ho' song.The fun bits are fun; the serious bits are serious; the awful bits are awful; the feel-good bits make you feed good. 'Snow White' doesn't seem to do anything by halves. It's a truly charming gem of a film. I can hardly praise it enough. Walt Disney didn't put a foot wrong with this one. It was Walt Disney's first full-length film and in my opinion it will always be his finest hour. It's a masterpiece of entertainment. It even had me shedding a tear at the end! It's just a brilliant film - a classic. Few films have or ever will be as good, original and ground- breaking as this one.10/10",

Of particular note is the scene of Snow White running through the forest and the scenes involving the forest animals. Those forest animals are the single most impressive thing in the movie, flowing and swirling like leaves in the air, almost constantly in motion yet never unpleasantly chaotic. At the same time, these scenes have been so well parodied in other movies that at times they seem a bit absurd. Even before the parodies, there is something over the top about the dainty, domestic princess with a way with animals.For me, the movie lost a little momentum with the entry of the dwarfs, whose broad humor interested me less than the more serious earlier animation. This is not to say that the dwarfs weren't funny, in that mild, Disney way (both now and as a child I preferred the sharp, sarcastic style of Warner Brothers cartoons to the genial Disney style), but the focus on comedy meant less of a focus on pure artistry. The movie is also very much of its time. Snow White is the small-town girl ideal, a sweet and trusting princess who wanders into an empty house and immediately starts cleaning it. She has the girlish voice of Betty Boop without the attitude, and I found her a bit bland (although less so than Sleeping Beauty, many years later.Overall, this is a very entertaining movie with moments of greatness.",

This film could be classified as a musical too.Originating from a Grimms tale this is a magical moral story that will entertain one of any age as it's message is timeless. The story centers around a beautiful and kindhearted princess named Snow White and shamefully she is forced to be a working slave that scrubs floors and all this comes from her wicked and jealous stepmother the Queen. Still that doesn't hide the charm that this princess has as she charms every creature in the kingdom. Interesting and somewhat of a fortune telling experiment is the Magic mirror telling the Queen that Snow White is the fairest one of all. This enrages the Queen as she has deadly plans for Snow White so it's time for this little princess to get away.Snow White goes on an uncertain journey adventure fleeing into the forest where she meets cute animals and later she befriends the odd and strange but lovable seven dwarfs named Doc, Sneezy, Grumpy, Happy, Bashful, Sleepy and Dopey. Lessons are learned and love is developed as these little guys learn to be neat and clean and whistle and \"Heigh-Ho\" while they work at an old diamond mine! Only a favor is returned to Snow White as the Queen's wicked transformation is pushed over a cliff with help from her seven friends. And a nice beautiful return to life from the deadly apple is provided in the form of the prince's kiss. And they live happily ever after in this wonderful fairy tale.Overall one of Disney's best a good moral tale of good against evil proving that friendship helps and that beauty will win over the wicked.

Many people dismiss those films, mostly because they consider them to be \"only for kids\". In fact, it is not only Disney films: Many good animation films are ignored and labeled as kid's stuff, disregard of the quality of the histories or the visual beauty of them. Even in the recent year, with the success of cartoons such as \"The Simpsons\", \"South Park\", King of the Hill\" and even \"Family Guy\" (Though I hate that show), animation is still considered a \"minor\" genre, with the children always being considered as the main target of it. Personally, I don't care about those prejudices: I have seen many animated films and series during my whole life. Some of them were good, others were bad\u0085Some were excellent, and also, there were some animated films that had more artistic value and were more mature than many live-action films, even those that are considered \"classics\".And even when \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" it's a movie \"for kids\" (I prefer to say that it's a movie for the whole family) that doesn't avoid it to have many artistic qualities that could be appreciated by the adults: In fact, I have to say this is one of the most beautiful films ever made. Not only the quality of the animation it's incredibly good even by modern standards (Actually, the animation from this film seems much more fluid and \"alive\" than many of the recent movies made with CGI, with splendid sceneries, and a lovely use of colors) but also the story of this film, (despite that it could be considered way too simple by modern viewers) has a unique feeling of magic that not many movies have, being comparable with classic movies such as \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"The Thief of Bagdad\"\u0085That \"magic\" is present in every single scene from this movie, where everything seems to be made with love and effort, an honest work made for the enjoyment of the audience, a quality that most of the modern movies have forgotten in order to became heartless product for the mass consumption.They don't make animated movies like this anymore, which is such a shame. \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" totally deserves to be considered as a classic.

He was told it was a folly that would bankrupt his company, no one would endure bright colors and little creatures fooling around on a big screen for more than an hour\u0085 but since when do geniuses listen? \"It all started with a mouse\" loved to remind Walt Disney, as an encouragement for people to believe in their dreams and never underestimate the magical value of the smallest creations. The road for success is paved from these little ideas, visions and intuitions \u0085 even the iconic Mickey Mouse would have been named Mortimer if it wasn't for a precious advice from Disney's wife. And starting with his iconic mascot, Walt Disney established a real laboratory on the field of animation. It was the famous 'Silly Symphonies' era that brought up to screen so many enchanting cartoons, featuring animals, trees, flowers and music in the purest tradition of European storytelling. When you compare \"Flowers and Trees\", first animated cartoon in colors made in 1932, with the unforgettable \"Band Concert\", made three years later, you realize how impressive the progresses were but when you see \"The Old Mill\", 1937 classic masterpiece of realism, you immediately get the feeling of a crucial step finally reached, and asking for something more adult, more revolutionary \u0085 Mickey Mouse and the 'Silly Symphonies' contributed to the success of the Walt Disney company but what Disney needed was a flourishing empire, a bigger project that probably started with an innocent 'what if' question. Making an animated feature \u0085 think about it, in term of works, it's probably equivalent of making ten or twelve animated films with the same level of artistry as \"The Old Mill\" with the whole gallery of emotions we would expect from a film: thrills, laughs, passion, endearing characters and memorable songs. I make it sound like a 'business plan', but we're talking of the then highest grossing film of all time on which the whole existence of the Disney Company was jeopardized. If only for that, \"Snow White\" deserves all the praises for having been one of the most groundbreaking creations, on the same sensational level as \"Star Wars\", 40 years later. And Disney couldn't have thought of a better story to begin with. \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" is in total aesthetic harmony with the 'Silly Symphonies' (the setting, the presence of animals) and the drawing, especially of the dwarfs as cartoon characters, was the final step of what was developed during a whole decade by the Disney studios, inspired from the old classic European drawings that always had a sort of cartoon feel. \"Snow White\" stylish simplicity makes it appealing on a universal and timeless level. It can look old but never dated, and Disney proved his international ambitions by allowing the foreign animation studios to adapt the frameworks to their own language. Disney meant business \u0085And the result is a triumph of both storytelling and perfectionism, Disney didn't think animation and made it into a film, he thought of a realistic film first, hence encouraged his staff to use classic designs to draw the face of Snow White, the Prince, and the Evil Queen, they might look very basic compared to Disney's following works but they're human enough to suspend the disbelief that we're watching a cartoon, an important element in order to catch the interest of the adults and awakes their inner child. And the film respected the viewer's comfort so much that the use of relief, perspective, zooming and lights and shadows was made in a constant attention to the smallest realistic details, and on that level, the making-of of \"Snow White\" is an inspirational encouragement for work and perfectionism, with dreams fulfillment as the pay-off. Another interesting aspect relies on the character of Snow White herself, so unfairly mentioned as one of the least interesting Disney heroines, when her main interest was to be a foil for the dwarfs and the villain. The dwarfs prove how intuitive Disney was for his first film, as they allowed to provide a set of seven different personalities with an almost three-dimensional value, this is the fantastic trick of the film, try to watch the other versions of Snow White, and you'll see how cruelly lacking a personality the dwarfs are. It's almost impossible to think of them without visualizing Dopey, Doc, Sneezy, Grumpy, Sleepy, Happy and Bashful. And Snow White is the central of that universe, like the emotional core of the film that justifies the dwarfs' comicality, the Prince's passion and the Queen's evilness, another aspect of the film that provides it a timeless feel. The Evil Queen embodies the combination of beauty and vanity, she's so cold, she looks like a modern woman with an undeniable sex-appeal, and if one thing, she's the very proof of the Disney Golden Rule, there's no good Disney film without a great villain.And thanks to a final and successful pacing, the rest is history and like every classic masterpiece, each scene of \"Snow White\" is a classic on its own, the forest with eyes, the dwarfs coming from home, the Queen's haunting metamorphosis, so many songs forever engraved in our memories, \"Whistle While you work\", \"Heigh-Ho\", \"Someday my Prince Will Come\" the party and a finale that would make all the people, kids or adults, in the world cry and laugh, and finally cheer \u0085 discovering the Disney effect, that for each laugh, there would be a tear, a feeling that would last for many decades over and over again.Thank you, Mr. Disney for your contribution to the world of animation, film-making and entertainment!",

The movie boasts of a score that you will love and come to respect. Disney's beginning was so good that you just have to dip your hat to the dream of Walt Disney himself. It features the depth of imagination from the Disney crew that has long be welcomed and has been their trademark for years, nothing beats the names of the seven dwarfs and their characters. Before Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Disney studio had been producing animated short subjects in the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was to be the first full length cel animated feature in motion picture history, and to be able to keep up with the high production cost of over 1 million dollars which is considerably high for any movie at all in 1937, Disney had to mortgage his house.The plot foundation is taken from the Grimm stories of Snow White, and Disney's seven dwarfs twist is what stands in the memory most as the story of Snow White.Disney's gamble at that time was seen as foolishness, with many trying to talk him out of it, but after the movie was done and the first viewing was over, not only did Disney get a 10 minutes standing ovation, he also received a full size Oscar statuette and seven miniature ones for his work, this was presented to him by 10 year old child star actress Shirley Temple.It has also received many other notable recognition in its time, it is listed as the 34th greatest movie of all time in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) and it is listed in their AFI's 10 Top 10 animated Film, as the number 1 Animated film of all time. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs provided enough revenue for Disney to build his studio, and also provided enough for them to make another two animations, Pinocchio and Fantasia. Snow White is the first of its kind, and the great thing about it is that it is not just a celebrated mediocre of an attempt at something different, the movie is a good animation, one you will most enjoy. www.lagsreviews.com",

            "content": "This is the first animated feature length film produced by the Walt Disney Productions. There will be spoilers ahead:This is, in my opinion, the greatest animated film of all time. It is certainly the greatest animated film ever produced in the US. It's a remarkable piece of work and, for its time, a monumental undertaking. It was in production for over three years and cost close to $1,500,000, a massive amount at the time. It was a smash hit when it was released and won a special Oscar from the Academy. While it was nominated for its musical score, none of its songs were nominated in the song category.The story is quite familiar at this point, so I'll briefly summarize it here. Snow White is a princess whose stepmother is a vain and vindictive woman, jealous of her step-daughter's beauty. When the queen's mirror declares Snow White \"the fairest one of all\", the queen plots to have her killed. The plot fails and Snow winds up coming to live with seven dwarfs, winning them over and taking care of them.The queen learns that Snow still lives and decides to take matters in her own hands, poisoning Snow with an apple which puts her in a deep sleep. The queen is killed and Snow is awakened by her true love.The animation is breathtaking and still looks great even after all this time. The songs and the score are catchy and memorable and the characterizations are excellent. This is a first-class achievement in all respects.This film is available on DVD and Blu Ray and is well worth having. Most highly recommended.",

This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family with lots of humor, romance, and laughter. This story is told through classic characters. For a full-feature movie, there really aren't that many characters. Besides Snow White and the Seven dwarfs (Doc, Happy, Sneezy, Dopey, Grumpy, Bashful, and Sleepy); the only other characters were the Wicked Witch, the mirror (surprisingly having a personality of it's own), the prince and the Woodsman.Like any good Disney movie, it's filled with lots of animals who behave more like people: Birds (Doves, Raven, Vultures, owl, etc.), bats, alligators, rabbits, squirrels, deer, raccoons, chipmunks, butterflies, rats; there is even a mouse, fly, and horse).Of course, there are songs in good Disney movies as well. Famous songs from this movie are \"I'm Wishing,\" \"Whistle While You Work,\" \"Hi Ho,\" and \"Someday My Prince Will Come.\"A couple negatives in this movie: I wasn't partically too keen on the Prince. Snow White's voice was a bit annoying.Some parents may want to be cautious of the Wicked Queen's scene. She mixes a potion and casts a spell. There are skeletons and skulls that were obviously human at one time.",

A masterpiece of art that laid the foundation of a new genre, resisted the test of time and to this day it keeps its place at the top of best movies of all times. Despite the progress of technology, even after 80 years, few cartoons reached this level. These days cartoons are not made by hand and the production process is much faster and easier, but movies are mostly tragically bad. That's sad. By today's standards I would give it 8/10, but considering that it was handmade 80 years ago and influence it has on everything that came after, even 10/10 is not enough.And of course, we must not forget fantastic songs led by \"Heigh-Ho\".",

            "content": "In the name of Christmas, I dare to tackle Disney once again! Watching thisrecently, I was struck by how simple and straightforward a watch it is. It really is the most simple fairytale you can get, and it seemed so much bigger when I was little. But nonetheless it still tells a great story of good and evil, wonder, and of course the happy ending, that's such a joy to get into. It looks like a storybook come to life and has such a charming quaintness to it that gets right in your heart and stays there! I can't help but marvel at all the endless rich small details there are in everything, there's such magnificent artistry on display here. The lush outdoor scenes, and the incredible realistic use of light and shadows. The animators took everything they learned from the wonderful training ground that was the Silly Symphonies and poured all of the best elements and techniques into this, and you can feel the spirit of what they were trying to express in animated form and it's beautiful and quite amazing. It's simplistic but it was their very first film. The next one though has a great complexity of emotions and dark undertones to it. Not by any means that this doesn't have its grim touches. Words such as dead kill death and blood are spoken, the excellent early scene where Snow White gets overwhelmed by her own fear and sees the woods as monstrous faces feels like a bit of a homage to the early more twisted animations of the Fleisher Brothers to me. There's the macabre prospect of an actual heart the Queen holds in an ornate box that's left to the imagination, and the climactic scene where the Dwarfs charge after the Queen - my goodness, they clearly mean to kill her! And finally when through her own doing she falls to her death very ominously. Snow White herself is so impossibly lovely and adorable that it's like she represents happiness and innocence. She's just a sweet singing girl in the woods with apparently a superpower to command the animals! You ask me if a person can watch \"Whistle While You Work\" without smiling or feeling lightened at all then they ain't got no heart... She has the voice of an angel and children have loved her for generations. Not to criticise too harshly, but I noticed that apart from supplying many cute and funny sight gags, the animals also serve the purpose of making Snow White seem larger as a character. And when it's not them it's the Dwarfs. And in my opinion it's actually the Prince who's the real cardboard cutout character, but that's not his fault! And ah, the Queen, if nothing else you couldn't say that she's not a proactive woman! I love her, she's so ice cold and commanding. Her malicious intentions to Snow White alone make her one of the scariest Disney villains ever, for she plain old wants her dead, simply for being too pretty! My favourite scene is the exquisitely animated sequence that skillfully builds the malevolence where the evil Queen concocts a potion comprised of the most menacing of ingredients to transform into a cackling old crone. Her disorienting transformation from second fairest in the land to hideous hag is like a formula created by Alfred Hitchcock. And as she turns around and reveals her new face, every child in the theatre was compelled to jump in horror. Very witch-like, right down to the wart on the nose. From an adult's perspective however, the before and after makeover is truly a trick and a treat. It makes me laugh every time when the crow is in the skull! The Dwarfs are what most people always remembered. It's in the collective consciousness because of them. In Gremlins, everybody knows what \"Hi-Ho!\" is! My favourite one is Grumpy because he pretends not to care, but he cares very much. It means something to me when he secretly blushes at Snow White's kiss, when he warns her not to let anyone in the cottage, when he cries out \"We gotta save her!\", and at that sad scene that's like a wake he sobs more than any of them at her supposed death. Good character, gruff and mean on the outside, kind on the inside. At the time before it came out they said that a feature length 'cartoon' couldn't work, that no one could emotionally connect to a character that was hand-drawn. How wrong they were. This film's true impact on popular culture is untold, I mean for one thing there wouldn't have been a Wizard of Oz movie without it, and that picture is a whole phenomenon in itself, nor would there have been a Disney legacy as we know it without the success of this film. It's certainly archaic, but to me it doesn't particularly feel like something that's pushing one hundred years, which is something that truly makes it, as Disney would say, timeless. The \"greatest folly\", ended up being the greatest triumph. I always love watching this, I feel the same way about it that I do about all the Disney films that I love, watching them is like 'going home...'",

With excellent humor, charming and very lovable characters (for the most part), and songs that still hold up today, Disney had succeeded in transforming animation into anything but a genre, which, sadly, is what most audiences think of these types of movies today. Appreciate not just the importance to animation, but also the character development and the story. This was a movie that I could see frequently, for my grandparents have it on VHS, and it has been a family favorite like Aladdin, The Jungle Book, and The Fox and The Hound.

            "content": "[May contain slight spoilers, but who doesn't know the story of Snow White?]Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is said by many to be the first and the best. The first feature length animated motion picture- yes, no doubt about it. As for the best, I'm not that sure. Don't get me wrong, I could definitely see why many people would say that this is Disney's best. For me it would be very hard to say what was Disney's best of the best but if I had to choose top 10 our dear Snow White would be amongst them. It's quite an extraordinary film, especially considering the time it was made. It features characters you're bound to bump into at Disneyland, the characters who perhaps shaped future Disney characters to come. First we have- who else but our heroin a girl with lips red as the rose, hair black as ebony and skin white as snow... did you guess yet? Of course this is Snow White, and no wonder from that description why the Queen, her stepmother is so jealous of her. The Queen in Snow White if you ask me is the coldest and one of the cruelest Disney villains to have ever roamed on movie screens. In fact she was deemed so scary that in England children under the shocking age of 16 had to be accompanied by adults to see this movie. You can clearly see the effect the Queen had on Disney villains to come, after the animators' lesson with her, no villain became as cold and scary and usually from then on the villains were accompanied by humor and sarcasm, which the queen does not have. No, she is out for Snow White and does not stop for jokes- how does Snow White dare be prettier than her?! I tell you if this Queen was to attend a beauty pageant I pity the other contestants. And so the Queen hires a hunter to kill Snow White but who (but the queen) could kill Snow White? Such a young beautiful and lovable woman? The hunter warns Snow White and off into the forest she runs and that forest scene is still one of the scariest Disney animators have drawn. Soon enough we meet the seven dwarfs whose names reflect their personalities. I always believed that everyone on earth has a bit of each trait of each of the seven dwarfs in him. There's Doc (the 'leader' of the dwarfs). There's Happy, Sleepy, Bashful and Sneezy (who I am often compared to seeing that I can probably get into the Guinness Book of Records for most sneezes). And finally there are perhaps the two most memorable of the little men- Grumpy, the grumpiest of them all and Dopey who can't speak, he never tried. Dopey is also the more childlike dwarf and the only one without a beard. But do you really think Disney could let Snow White off that easy? Nope, neither did I. The Queen soon finds out that the heart that her huntsman gave her was not that of Snow White, but that of a pig's. Well then, dear Queeny here will not let Snow White be prettier than her (even though she's living in a little house somewhere in the woods where the only people who can see her are seven tiny men... just shows how cruel this queen was). She transforms into an old peddler woman, the transformation being one of Disney's most unforgettable scenes. She tricks Snow White into eating a poisonous apple and just when all hope is lost Prince Charming comes and kisses her and she awakens and... they lived happily ever after.Flawless? No, is there a flawless movie? I highly doubt it and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is no exception, but like many other Disney movies it has very few and rather irrelevant flaws. The biggest thing that bothered me was the simple fact that the prince was to effeminate (as was the one in Cinderella but Sleeping Beauty proved that Disney could draw a more masculine prince). The songs include Some Day My Prince Will Come (a song which many girls, I know have sung to themselves), Whistle While You Work (which many people have heard so much that they have forgotten it is from Snow White). And of course who hasn't hummed Heigh Ho while in rush hour on their way to work? God knows, I've hummed it way too many times. The animation I will say is spectacular, of course more sophisticated animation was yet to come but it still remains very well- especially the animation of the evil queen. Ranks high up there, though maybe not at number one as one of Disney's greatest achievements and greatest motion pictures of all time.",

If you ask me, the queen (voice of Lucille La Verne) was truly diabolical. Still, she was very attractive. On the other hand, Snow White (voice of Adriana Caselotti) was very beautiful. In addition, as the magic mirror said, nothing could hide her beauty. Also, she could truly sing. Well, despite the fact that everyone in this film could sing, Snow White was the best. This would probably be because she did most of the singing. To me, the scenery was beautiful, the cast was well chosen, and the writing was strong. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this charming Disney masterpiece which is very romantic to all of you who haven't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",

It is a singularly amazing triumph, with memorable characters, catchy songs, and a fairy tale setting, this film outlined the recipe of old and upcoming films, like RAPUNZEL.The most chilling part of this film-the dramatic villain-the Evil Queen, who turns herself into a hag to kill Snow White, so she can be \"Fairest in the land.\"And this film has it's place as the most fantastic DVD debut of all time for a Disney film. I do not have the discs, but borrowed them from a friend once, and I was in deep shock with the dazzling restoration in picture and sound.The comic relief is a most spectacular hilarity in this film. With the Seven Dwarfs-Happy, Bashful, Doc, Sneezy, Grumpy, Sleepy and most memorable of all Dopey, this film is a pure treat with it's innocent charm in the department of comedy.All in all, this film is a sheer joy-Spotless.

            "content": "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is often overlooked, for several reasons, including (but not confined to) \"it's sexist\", \"it's boring\", \"Snow White can't sing\"...etc. However, in comparison to most Modern Disney movies, Snow White is brilliant. It was an artistic achievement in 1937, and it still stands up as a landmark in movie history. The story is (as most people will know), a princess is orphaned and is 'looked after' by her stepmother, who grows increasingly jealous of the young princess's growing beauty. The princess, Snow White, is forced to slave away for her stepmother, the Queen, until the Queen decides to have her killed. However, the huntsman chosen to do the deed cannot go through with it, and Snow White is forced to run away into the forest where she is taken in by seven dwarfs. All is fine, until the Queen realises that Snow White is not dead. Cue the transformation scene and the poison apple...and that's as far as I'll go. Although the heroine is, admittedly, two-dimensional and the movie comes across as bordering sexist...well, it's a product of it's time. I'll leave it at that. The fact that the beautiful animation can still stand up next to more recent Disney movies is an achievement in itself. And the fact that you can compare the two and probably say that Snow White's animation is superior is an even greater achievement. The songs are beautiful, Snow White's singing *is* proper singing, she has more talent then many of the recent Broadway princesses put together. Product of the time maybe, but still outstanding. 9/10",

Just as Disney's SNOW WHITE was a \"Landmark\" in 1937, being the first feature-length animated film, now, the 2001 DVD Platinum Editon (two Discs) release of SNOW WHITE is likely to be considered a \"Landmark\" in the field of DVD's! The feature itself has never looked and sounded any better then seen here -- it's state of the art! And the EXTRAS (and the access to them) are absolutely amazing! More then 3 hours of material are contained on the second disc -- and choice material it is.

With an impressive and creative work from the designers, the characters come alive in a captivating way, and the public was mesmerized with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The audience was thrilled, many come to tears after Snow White ate the the poisoned apple, and the success was so astonishing that the movie became one of the most watched movies in history, and it still continues to captivate millions of people around the world. This was Walt Disney's cornerstone, all that he made after was based on this unique movie, and because of it he was one of the few persons in the world able to fulfill the most of his dreams.

I saved this for last because, let's face it, I'm a guy who's more at home with a good Western than a Disney fairy tale, and it would look pretty silly to be seen watching this picture by someone pulling up the driveway and looking though the bay window. So for this viewing, I grabbed my two year old granddaughter for cover, and casually mentioned to her mom and my wife that \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" was about to begin.You know, I must have seen this as a kid because I remember a fair amount about it, especially the 'Heigh-Ho' song and the talking mirror business. Watching today I was a bit surprised by some of the scary elements in the story, starting off with the Evil Queen's command to the Huntsman to bring back the heart of Snow White in a box. I thought about that for some time, and then wondered what ever happened to the Huntsman. Someone spilled the beans about the pig heart gimmick, but the Queen never got her revenge as far as I could tell.Since everyone knows the story, I'll mention some of the things I thought about in context of the picture's release in 1937. The term 'Jiminy Crickets' was used twice in the story, but the character of Jiminy Cricket didn't appear in a Disney picture until 1940's \"Pinocchio\". Up till then, using the term was sort of a sanitized way of taking the Lord's name in vain, sometimes exclaimed as 'Jiminy Christmas'. Judy Garland's character Dorothy in \"The Wizard of Oz\" says it when startled by the Wizard's lightning and thunder display - \"Oh! Oh! Jiminy Crickets!\" There's also the Evil Queen's use of a poisoned apple to put Snow White to sleep, reminiscent of the Bible story of Adam and Eve and the forbidden fruit. But the thing that really intrigued me was when my daughter questioned Snow White's brown eyes. I didn't think much of it until my wife joined the picture in progress about ten minutes later. She remarked on the same thing. It never occurred to me that Walt Disney avoided the blond, blue-eyed stereotype that seemed to be the characteristic of an ideal princess. I haven't read any other observations on this, so I'm just throwing it out there.Anyway, as an animated classic, this one holds up pretty well after seventy plus years, paving the way for a Disney industry that's still going strong. Considering that the animation was all done by hand makes it even more amazing - the characters, the animals, the Seven Dwarfs all come to life in a magical way that enthralled my granddaughter, keeping her rapt attention until the very end. There's only one thing you can say to that - 'Jiminy Crickets'!",

            "content": "Of course one of the things about animated movies is that no matter when they got made they never look old. \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" got made in 1937 but it looks just as good and the same as Disney movies- and other full length animated movies that got made in much later decades. You can say that \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" was the movie that set the standards for animated movies and was a sign of things to come. It's also the reason why the movie won a special Academy Award for 'pioneering a great new entertainment field'. It was not awarded on simple Academy Award but also 7 smaller ones along with it. A nice and fitting tribute.Even though it's the very first full length animated Disney feature it's also actually one of the most daring ones. Some moments are truly scary done and the movie features some real horror like moments and even a skeleton in a shocking scene. No way Disney movies would allow these sort of imagery these days. It shows they were still looking for the right style and approach for their movies at the Disney studios.But it's funny to note how little the animation style had actually changed for the Disney movies over the years. Right till the '90's Disney movies used the same animation style and were just as good and smooth looking as this movie. It makes it all the movie obvious what a great accomplishment for 1937 this movie was. Not only the characters and their movies are looking fine but also the backgrounds and all of the other little details in it.So it's not a movie that is outdated with its style but it of course is with its story. As a matter of fact \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" story is shockingly simply and there hardly is any story development. It also is disgustingly happy and friendly with all of the cuddly animals in it and the sweet character of Snow White herself. But yet this at the same time is definitely part of the charm of \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\".While the comedy is not as good or much present as would be the case in a Disney short, featuring Donald Duck or Mickey Mouse for example, it still is a very fun movie to watch, which is due to the overall atmosphere of the movie and the likability of the characters.The characters from this movie are still among the best and most memorable ones out of all Disney movies. Not just Snow White herself but also obviously the seven dwarfs, who also make the movie mostly entertaining to watch. The Queen/Witch is also a good memorable Disney villain, even though her role is actually quite small in the movie.Also this earliest Disney movie already featured songs in it. Some of them are still classics and it's must better stuff when compared to some Disney movies which got made in the first years after \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", with the exception of \"Pinocchio\", which was the first next big Disney project after this one.Still just as good and watchable as it was at the time of its release.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

The title is a reference to purity and influence. It is something Walt Disney joined in favor of its seemingly mystical translation. She labors for her evil Queen mother who grows frustrated when her magic mirror informs her that Snow White is the fairest of them all. Perhaps she needs to learn how to take criticism. She orders that Snow White be killed but she flees into the forest and befriended by seven dwarfs. They each have distinguishing qualities in which their names are based. Soon the Queen tricks Snow White into eating a poisonous apple leaving a Prince to break the spell with a kiss. This is problematic because the idea of an enchanted kiss is never explained but just accepted as a romantic notion. Beautifully animated with imaginative storytelling and directing by David Hand. Adriana Caselotti voices Snow White whose wakened kissed came before over the counter drugs. Lucille La Verne steals scenes as the evil Queen. The Prince is an absolute bore. The seven dwarfs are identified by their name glitches as oppose to personalities. The huntsman refuses to slay Snow White. The result is an enchanting landmark spectacular.

We all know the story, so I'm not going to write it all out, just use IMDb's synopsis: Snow White, pursued by a jealous queen, hides with the Dwarfs; the queen feeds her a poison apple, but Prince Charming awakens her with a kiss.The animation in the film is gorgeous, even by today's standard (save the Huntsman and the Prince, they look somewhat odd). Snow White genuinely looks like a young girl, and the Queen looks like a real woman. The way the Dwarfs are drawn is enjoyable, and so are the characters. Snow White is kind, cheerful, good with animals, and has a good personality (not to mention the fact she became a mother to the Seven Dwarfs - a tough job). The Dwarfs are all memorable and lovable, with Grumpy and Dopey being the most liked. The Queen is a great villain. Her drive to kill a young girl so she can be the most beautiful, which makes her go insane is incredibly disturbing and creepy, and the way she looks as the Witch is great. The film's music and songs are also perfect and memorable, with \"Heigh-ho\" and \"Someday my Prince will Come\" as the standouts. This is also perfectly paced, with sweet moments, scary moments, and time for character development.So, what else can I say? Gorgeous animation, memorable characters, perfect music, and a brilliantly constructed plot. A true cinematic masterpiece not to be missed.",

There isn't much that hasn't already been said about \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" 1937 version, Walt Disney's first feature length animated film. Suffice it to say that it not only fulfilled the studio's hopes beyond their wildest dreams. The movie that made possibility of the Disney films that followed it. From the famous Grimm fairy tale about a beautiful princess who flees her jealous stepmother and finds refuge with seven friendly dwarfs, Walt Disney created a cinematic milestone. At the time the film was in production until the day it was released, rival producers were supposedly referring to it as \"Disney's Folly\".Although this myth has been recently debunked in film historian JB. Kaufman's magnificent new book (''The Fairest One Of All:The Making Of Walt Disney's Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs''Weldon Owen/Disney Press, 2012)it's true that only after it's huge success, did fellow movie makers attempt their own full-length cartoon features. Upon it's debut, at Hollywood's Carthay Circle theater, (December 21, 1937)the film was embraced both by critics and audiences, grossing many times it's then record (for an animated film) $1.5 million budget. Eight successful reissues have kept the movie in the public consciousness now for over six decades, during which time the field of animation has grown by leaps and bounds. Still. despite the cinematic advances and the passage of time, \"Snow White\" stands alone. While the classic story is but a framework for the film (a fact which troubled me for years), \"Snow White\" can be fully enjoyed for the pioneer it truly is. Along, with a splendid cast of voice actors/ actresses headed by Adriana Caselotti (Snow White) Harry Stockwell (father of Guy and Dean, as the Prince) and Lucille La Verne (The Queen). Much time and effort went toward developing the characters of the Seven Dwarfs and giving each a distinct personality (absent in the original story) which went a long way in making audiences care for Snow White's plight. Interestingly enough, although the fairy tale was toned down considerably to make it more \"family friendly\", the overzealous way in which the film makers transformed the Wicked Queen into a hideous hag at the climax was the subject of an incredible amount of controversy at the time. In fact, it was under a partial ban in England which made it off-limits to children under 16 years of age! Nevertheless, it was the recipient of a special Academy Award in 1938.",

Also Lucille La Verne also voiced two characters - The Queen and The Witch.Many animated versions have been produced of this charming fairytale and this one out stood them all with it's animation, songs, characters and that Disney touch! This animated version was the original and simply is the fairest of them all!! JCJ",

I love it in the movie when Sneezy sneezes and it causes the dwarfs to go flying like a Hurricane wind and Grumpy says You crazy fool! By time you you pick to sneeze! I also liked Doc and his spoonerisms like when they arrive back at their house from the mines and Doc says Look! Our house the lits light uh the lights lit. That was hilarious! Filled with wonderful characters, music, story, comedy, and animation Snow White is a true animation treasure that no matter how old Snow White is as she's turning 72 years old this year she'll always be the fairest of them all! Walt Disney was a genius when he made Snow White in 1937. He deserved the award given to him by Shirley Temple in 1938 for the movie. God bless you Walt Disney and thank you for showing us what animation can do when you tell a wonderful and great story. Snow White will always be the fairest of them all!",

But now I have.The story is familiar - this is a fairly faithful adaptation of the Grimm Brothers' original, albeit nicely tweaked to point up (for instance) the humorous role of the dwarfs and, frankly, to pad it - there are a number of sequences which are very entertaining but not very plot relevant. The drama works well, the character design is excellent, the animation is very good (and the effects animation is stunning), several of the songs are classics (and several aren't), and there are places where it is genuinely scary, especially for small children.It's not perfect.

But you wouldn't have been able to be able to watch forty-three animated hits, plus many semi-cartoon classics like Mary Poppins if it weren't for the first fairy tale adaptation:SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS.You've got to like it. One must appreciate it was the first of its genre. I must admit I prefered Pinocchio (the second Disney classic which followed) as a child. And that's not saying Snow White is rubbish. It's a beautiful and jolly film. It's got a lot of good points, as well as bad points. Note possible spoilers.The film opens as a white book helping set the scene that the Queen is vain and selfish. We then zoom into the Queen's bedroom in which see her see who is beautiful and if she's the sexiest woman in Cartoonland. Unfortunately, the Mirror says Snow White is. The Queen starts to show her evil by her bid to kill ther mysterious princess stepdaughter. The Queen's dialogue is beautiful, similar to that of Lady Macbeth (Walt did partially base the Queen's character on the Shakespearian villainess). The language is at it's beat in the transformation scene.The next scene is where we meet Snow White. This is where the film falls flat. Snow White is a giggly bimbo with a freaky voice. If a pop singer had that kind of voice these days, she would fade away. Since when did Britney Spear's voice vibrate rapidly in a nausiating fashion? What's more, as the film progresses, the character gets even more nausiating. Snow White is even more stupid than the Mad Maddame Mim from Walt Disney's Classic The Sword in the Stone. In the last scene where she talks, she lets a strange stranger in, despite the warnings from the Dwarfs. And that didn't get her anywhere, did it now?The Prince is equally as stupid. Unlike in Sleeping Beauty or The Little Mermaid, the Prince did not join in the Let's-Kill-The-Witch scene, which destroys his character as a Robin Hood hero and changes him into a lazy slob of a Prince.The Dwarfs, on the other hand, are loveable and believable, mainly due to the fact that everybody is like one of the Seven Dwarfs. But my favourite character is the Henchman. By keeping him out of the story a lot, he is the only fully believable true-human character. Just shows how Disney works wonders with people, doesn't it?",

            "content": "After watching the recent Disney animated feature-The Princess and the Frog-I decided to finally see the recent DVD I bought of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs-Uncle Walt's first attempt at a full-length cartoon-for the first time ever. Now, despite the bland characterization of the Prince-not to mention his stiff drawn movements which caused the animators to reduce his role-and the female title character only marginally better personality-wise, this is still a very entertaining initial attempt at an animated feature from the Disney studio. That's largely due to the way each of the Seven Dwarfs become charmingly charismatic in their personalities due to both movements and voices. I mean, Dopey is the perfect Harpo-like character with the way he communicates without saying a word (though we do hear him express shock and sadness when those moments appear, courtesy of Eddie Collins). Also perfect are the characterizations of Sneezy-with Laurel & Hardy player Billy Gilbert doing his iconic sneeze-and Grumpy-with Goofy creator Pinto Colvig giving his grouch a touch of likability that makes one identify with him. And Lucille La Verne is just suitably atmospheric voicing both the mean Queen stepmother of White and that Queen's later change to the Witch. While Ms. White is not a vibrant personality, she still has some naive charm that makes it understandable why the Dwarfs, even eventually Grumpy, fall for her. That's all due to her voice of Adriana Caselotti when she's both singing and speaking. It's too bad Mr. Disney didn't allow her to do any further outside work (though it's nice to know her voice can be heard in both 1939's The Wizard of Oz-as part of the Tin Man's thought-and my favorite film of It's a Wonderful Life-as a singer in the Martini's Bar sequence). Many classic sequences include the \"Heigh Ho\" number, Grumpy's bath, the Queen's transformation, and the chase sequence involving the Dwarfs, the forest animals, and the Witch Queen's attempted escape. So on that note, while I don't think this movie is one of the best animated features-Disney or otherwise-ever, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is still pretty compelling as such things go. P.S. The Prince's singing and speaking voice is that of one Harry Stockwell, father of child and adult actor Dean Stockwell.",

            "content": "What was the first X-rated animated film?  Most people who have any kind of clue at all would say `Fritz the Cat', but they'd be wrong.  It's `Snow White'! - which received the equivalent of an X-rating in South Africa. (Parts of it ARE grisly, even if the Grimm brothers' story was more grisly still: in the story, the Queen asked for Snow White's lungs and liver - with the intention of eating them.)  This should dispel anyone's idea that the film is all cloying sentimentality.Here's another one: `Gone with the Wind' was the biggest box office hit of the 1930s, but what was the second biggest?  Oh, well, I guess everyone here knows the answer to that one.  It must be said that the second-biggest hit deserved its success far more than the first.`Snow White' can boast other things, too.  But let's not get carried away and say that in addition it's the BEST film of the 1930s, or the best animated film of all time, or Disney's supreme masterpiece, or something silly of that kind.  It clearly isn't any of these things.  Let's distinguish between `good considering that it's a first effort' and good simpliciter, and see how `Snow White' rates.Many things are good simpliciter.  Although the visual spectacle is dwarfed by that of `Pinocchio' and `Fantasia' - to name but two - it's still visual spectacle, and it still works.  Some of the special effects can still startle us.  (I have absolutely no idea how they managed to get that shot of Snow White's reflection in well, for instance.)  The art direction vividly creates a world of cosy dwellings surrounded by choking forest.  The use of colour is as marvellous and subtle as anything the studio produced after 1942 (if not quite up to the standards set by `Fantasia' or `Bambi').  In fact, every single feature after `101 Dalmations' (1961) fails to measure up to `Snow White' so far as colour is concerned.  A muted, watercolour effect (achieved WITHOUT actual watercolours) is enlivened by the rare splash of brilliance on the Queen's cape or on the poisoned apple, but there's more to it than that.  Note how we're not shown a wide palette of colours until the dwarfs appear, when it seems that every hue under the sun makes its way onto the screen.  The dwarfs are the only rounded characters, representing, between them, all aspects of humanity.  (Brilliantly animated, by the way.) It's surprising, or perhaps it isn't, that in an age in which computers allow art directors to fiddle around with the colour balance as much as they like, no-one seems to be able to use colour nearly so effectively.But there are also signs that the art wasn't yet ripe.  The most obvious one is the limited range: `Snow White' never does anything more than a particularly good pantomime might do (which is more than you might think), and while this isn't even a flaw, it does mean that the film simply can't compare with the broader masterpieces Disney produced immediately afterwards (`Pinocchio', `Fantasia', `Dumbo', `Bambi').  In 1937, Disney (and Hand and everyone else at the studio) still didn't know what to do to make a well-proportioned cartoon over an hour in length.  After the dwarfs have been around for a while the film starts to lose its way.  It even has to resort to title-card narration, indicating that while the first part of the story had been thought through properly, the rest hadn't been.  And there are minor technical difficulties throughout, with awkward animation of Snow White here, a clumsy use of the multiplane camera there.Don't get me wrong.  It's a lovely film, among the better ones the studio has produced.  We do it no service when we exaggerate its virtues.",

Still the most successful if you account for inflation. And there is a reason for all that success, and not just the fact that it was the first. It's the crown of Walt Disney Studios. There might be gems that shined brighter later on, but this is the base, the foundation of the studio's brilliance.And no, it's not a perfect film. You can still see that the animators were still learning away from the brief animated shorts they were more used to doing. The whole film is very episodic, with most of the time spent on general gallivanting and merriment. Especially with the dwarfs. There's a whole segment dedicated to them washing their hands. Actually, I lie. There's a whole segment AND a song dedicated to it. And sure, the dwarfs are great character, each a unique personality with hiccups and all, so the viewer doesn't really mind that the plot is pretty much forgotten much of the time, but you can nevertheless see that it's a work in progress as far as feature length storytelling is concerned.Luckily we have the Queen. And oh, what a way to introduce us to Disney villains. To this day she's one of the greats and it can be argued that the movie is actually about her, not Snow White nor the dwarfs. She's the first character we see, has pretty much the most dialogue and her scenes are the most captivating and actually move the plot forward. And she's a menace. Always plotting, scheming, cackling, being absolutely terrifying. The first look she gives us after her transformation is one of the scariest looks in cinema history.You've all seen this movie already.

It spawned a whole new line of motion picture entertainment. It still sets the standard for animated features today. And it was a simple good story incredibly well told. Snow White herself is only mildly interesting. But give her a cast of quirky and funny side characters, and you've got a brilliant picture. Snow White does not focus solely on plot. It slowly moves along, giving room for the scenes of her interacting with the dwarfs and animals to draw us into to the atmosphere. We really get to know all of the characters well. The storyline may be familiar, but it is spiced up to create something fresh (compare it to taking ordinary soup broth and then adding a perfect combination of seasonings to make the best soup you ever had). Snow White also has some of the best music ever recorded. A lot of what Disney would later use to lesser effect in other films was birthed here: The animals who are there to give Snow White something to relate to, the animation timed out to song movements, the glorious foreground and background animation panels filmed to give a 3D effect. And the artistic detail rendered by hand in each frame is breathtaking. Only Pinocchio bettered this masterwork in terms of sheer artistry. The dwarfs naturally steal the show, but the scenes with the queen are given full weight in their creepiness. Not too scary but scary enough to send shivers down kids' spines.

            "content": "Contrary to common belief, Walt Disney's 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' is not the earliest feature-length animated film. This title goes to Quirino Cristiani's now-lost 1917 Argentinian film, ''El Ap\u00f3stol / The Apostle.' Even as far as current availability in concerned, you can turn towards Lotte Reiniger's 'The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926)' for a brilliant animated film, featuring endearing silhouette animation and an exciting tale of heroes, villains and monsters. Released in 1937, 'Snow White' was Disney's first feature-length effort, as well as the first technicolour animated movie, and also briefly the most successful film of all time (until the release of 'Gone with the Wind' in 1939). After the excellent 'Fantasia (1940),' this was the second feature-length film I'd seen from Disney's early era, and I was instantly able to appreciate why it is so revered. One can only imagine how much effort must have gone into the 83 minutes of animation, and, despite this relatively brief running time, the film manages to flesh out so many wonderful characters and effectively evoke a range of emotions.The story is roughly based upon the German fairytale by the Brothers Grimm. A beautiful and wicked Queen (voiced by Lucille La Verne) learns one day, through her Magic Mirror, that her stepdaughter \u0096 the beautiful Snow White (Adriana Caselotti) \u0096 has surpassed her in beauty. Enraged, the Queen orders the princess murdered, but the kind-hearted servant cannot bring himself to commit the act. Abandoned in the forest, Snow White is aided by the gentle animals of the forest, and she stumbles upon the modest dwelling of a group of seven dwarfs, respectively named Doc, Dopey, Sleepy, Grumpy, Sneezy, Happy and Bashful, each with a personality that mirrors their own titles. Though initially hesitant about having a woman in their home, the little men eventually come to appreciate her presence, and all is going well until the Queen learns of her servant's disloyalty, and so crafts a new and terrible revenge for the sweet and innocent Snow White.Visually, 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' is nothing short of a masterpiece. Compared to the primitive cut-out silhouettes of 'The Adventures of Princess Achmed' just a decade earlier, the animation in this film is nothing short of staggering; every single frame is simply alive with vibrant colour and movement. In fact, the film proved such a monumental advance in the field of animation that it took until the arrival of Pixar Studios and CGI before anybody truly progressed beyond what had been achieved here. Colour is used magnificently to create intense moods, and the chasing of the Queen (transformed into a witch) through a raging thunderstorm is an absolute triumph of film-making, equal to anything produced before or since. Notably, a flawless 1937 Silly Symphonies short, 'The Old Mill,' served as an essential testing ground for many of the techniques used in 'Snow White,' including the animation of animals, rain, wind, lightning, ripples, splashes and reflections. Additionally, 'The Old Mill' also served as the trial-run for Disney's revolutionary multiplane camera, which was also used to remarkable effect here.",

Snow White is, truth to tell, a bit of a bore, not a character who acts but one whose mere existence inspires others to act. The mistake of most of Disney's countless imitators over the years has been to confuse the titles of his movies with their subjects. \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" is not so much about Snow White or Prince Charming as about the Seven Dwarfs and the evil Queen--and the countless creatures of the forest and the skies, from a bluebird that blushes to a turtle who takes forever to climb up a flight of stairs. So complex were his frames, indeed, that Disney and his team of animators found that the cels they used for their short cartoons were not large enough to contain all the details he wanted, and larger cels were needed. The film's earliest audiences may not have known the technical reasons for the film's impact, but in the early scene where Snow White runs through the forest, they were thrilled by the way the branches reached out to snatch at her, and how the sinister eyes in the darkness were revealed to belong to friendly woodland animals. The trees didn't just sit there within the frame. \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" was immediately hailed as a masterpiece. (The Russian director Sergei Eisenstein called it the greatest movie ever made.) It remains the jewel in Disney's crown, and although inflated modern grosses have allowed other titles to pass it in dollar totals, it is likely that more people have seen it than any other animated feature. The word genius is easily used and has been cheapened, but when it is used to describe Walt Disney, reflect that he conceived of this film, in all of its length, revolutionary style and invention, when there was no other like it--and that to one degree or another, every animated feature made since owes it something.",

            "content": "Disney's first feature film!! Hard to believe this thing was released in 1937 when my grandparents were just toddlers. This classic is of course the story of princess Snow White, the FAIREST in the land, and her being on the run from the evil queen who desires to be the fairest in the land. She plots to kill Snow White so that she can be the fairest, but as in all Disney animated classic, good will always win, and there's a handsome prince to help. This classic fairytale still holds up today, it's great animation, ESPECIALLY for 1937! It's very fun and entertaining, complete with catchy songs and well written characters like the dwarfs. The dwarfs are: Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey. They all of course behave exactly like their name and they work in a nearby mine, they stroll in single file every day singing their work song, hi ho hi ho..... Snow White stumbles upon them and their cottage and she begins to stay there with her while in hiding from the evil queen. The evil queen, who is a FANTASTIC Disney villain all the while is plotting a way to kill Snow White. I love the scene where she creates an elixir that will transform her into an ugly old hag so that snow will not recognize her as she offers a poisoned apple. One of the best scenes in animated movies if you ask me. Overall everyone knows about this Disney classic and if you or your family have not seen it then what are you waiting for lol. I highly suggest watching if you if you have younger children because they will LOVE it! Perfect for a family movie night with young kids. 9/10.",

Although the story is simple, it does make up for that because of its entertaining characters. Thanks to Disney each of the dwarfs got a name and personality, something that was lacking in all the Snow White stories I have read in fairy tale books. The songs are unforgettable especially the hey ho song when the dwarfs go back home. As a kid I found the witch very scary and think she is the scariest of all the Disney villains. Snow White never gets old as I still enjoy it as much as the first time I saw it at 6 years old in theater. I would give it a 10 if it wasn't for the story to be that simple.",

            "content": "I feel ashamed that I only watched Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in order so that my hard, cynical heart could launch itself into an anti-Disney rant. The most sentimental of the major cartoon studios, I was determined to ravage this one after seeing isolated, treacly clips.Yet seen all together I have to admit that I was softened by a talented picture that is genuinely charming. The somewhat dated animation resembles cut outs from a picture book with its pastel hues, and looks and feels more natural than the angular, jerky computerised movement of the modern Disney features. It helps that they also employ someone who can actually sing in the titular role, with an operatic blend to the proceedings. And it would take the coldest of people not to warm to Snow White's genuine innocence. I concede, I did wince a little at the cutesy blue birds, but this is vastly more charming than I had been led to expect.It's pacy, too: whereas some of the older Disney films tend to drag (I remember catching the aptly named Sleeping Beauty one Sunday afternoon), this one is suitably brisk in its portrayal of events. And while modern cartoons (or \"Animated Features\" as they pompously like to be known) blow up the role of the \"director\", this one really has its eye on cinematic technique. Just look at the early wishing well scene, shot from the perspective of the well bottom or the blend of images and dissolves when Snow White's in the forest.Many of the songs are classics, of course. Whistle While You Work is still something you can find yourself humming or whistling while doing the hoovering, The greatest contention for me though was the seven dwarves, who always struck me as far too self-consciously cutesy and grating to really like. Yet, come on \u0096 It's Off To Work We Go is a belter, isn't it?The actual plot, which is largely sidestepped to make way for the leisurely song sequences, is more than a little macabre. Even when Snow White's heart (her severed heart!) is substituted; it's replaced with a pig's heart... and all for a family audience. I'm not saying this one is morbid, but they deem Snow White (Or Snow, if we may call her that) so \"beautiful, even in death\" that they refuse to bury her and place her in a transparent coffin. In a parallel universe somewhere there's an offshoot of this movie where the Prince arrives too late and her rapidly decaying corpse turns into a flesh-eating zombie. Maybe they should do that as one of their special straight-to-video sequels \u0096 after all, they're grave robberies, aren't they?It's a slightly strange plot, too, with Snow White spending the duration being plotted against by a bitter old Queen. And people say Elton John didn't get involved with Disney until The Lion King. Yet in order to elicit Snow White's trust she transforms herself into a scary-looking old hag? Why not just stay in her own image? And if she can transform her appearance like that, then why not use the same magic to make herself the sought-after \"fairest of them all\"? Yet I guess if she didn't then we wouldn't have a story, and the apple ofference does have some religious connotations. This is a one-note plot, though, and subtext isn't the order of the day. Rather, it's the colour and flavouring of the piece that are there to be enjoyed, not the somewhat redundant narrative. And while, after the initial thrust, the film does lose momentum slightly, enjoy it I did, a delightful and wonderfully made cartoon. Yes, you can read into the white = good/black evil assertions, but for me I'd rather marvel at the songs and images, or make cheap jokes about MOR pianists.Just two minor points: why are they called \"Dwarfs\" and not Dwarves in the film's title? And seven dwarves working in a mine? Is that an example of positive discrimination?",

            "content": "\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", a film that has long been treasured and regarded with awe and amazement by audiences for seventy long years. Whether or not the viewer knows about the incredible painstaking work it took to make the animation in a film like this convincing enough for us, we do still look at the film and enjoy it despite the fact that its animation and style is far outdated. \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" is short, wonderful, and unique. Had it been made today, it may not have worked out. First of all, it would have had to be longer and with more interaction between several of the characters.However, there is something classic and timeless about \"Snow White\" which still works today. While I do strongly believe that the love story, although a major point in the plot, was exercised weakly onto the screen. The real reason for this is that the prince, whose name is never revealed, has such little screen time. I estimate about three minutes, maybe less. In my following research, I discovered that it was because of the incredible difficulty the animators found in drawing in frame-by-frame. That's how it was done back then.Putting aside the flaw with the character of the prince, the other characters were very well-done with both animation and development. Snow White is well-realized in looking innocent, kind, and depending on one's point-of-view, a beautiful Disney character. The seven dwarfs, the other title characters, were also well-done and they are the real stars of the film. Snow White provides the drama and heart-felt sympathy, while the dwarfs provide everything else except for antagonism. But they are the characters who make us laugh, or at least grin. And each is given a specific personality which makes them memorable. The evil queen, the villain of the story, is one of the coldest that Disney studios ever pulled out. Whichever physical form she is in, the queen, also unnamed, is a ruthless baddie. Her horrifying personality and decisions ultimately earned her a place in the Top 50 Villains of film history.So while \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" is an old, outdated film which does not always meet the expectations of audience members today, there is something about it that does work. It has been selected for preservation by the Library of Congress. I myself think it is worthy of such a position. I don't really know why, it's just a wonderful animated film in its own right. I liked it as a kid. And recently, I saw it again for the first time in years. It proved out to be more effective than I thought it as going to be. It just shows that films like this will probably last forever.",

Is it as good as I remember it? Will the re-visitation tarnish the precious memory of this film that I have?I am happy to report that, upon a fresh viewing of the first full length animated film every, that I can still declare SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS \"the fairest of them all\".Made in 1937, by the visionary Walt Disney, this film defies the odds - many calling it \"Walt's Folly\". No one had attempted a full length animated film before and the skeptics were many, but what Walt knew is that he had all the standard elements of a good story - a heroine we can root for, an evil villain, some comic characters that can help us laugh (and cry) and, more importantly, he had the skillful craftsmen of the Walt Disney Studios that can pull off such a feat.And...pull it off they did! This film is gorgeous and lush to look at. Upon this viewing, I was drawn to the background, and the edges of the frame, marveling at the detail that was interwoven into each, hand drawn imagery - giving this tapestry a lushness and thickness heretofore unseen on the screen.As for the story of the film - and the film itself - Disney was smart enough to know that \"less is more\". The film is compact - running a relatively quick 83 minutes - this was a two-fold solution. (1) It helped move the film along at a sprightly pace, never once resting or losing energy and (2) this means that the artists only had to draw what was necessary for this streamlined story.The music, of course, is wonderful and important part of this film. This was one of the first movie musicals, and was the first film to release a Soundtrack Album. From \"Some Day My Prince Will Come\" to \"I'm Wishing\" to \"Heigh-Ho\" and \"Whistle While You Work\", the songs moved the story forward and added depth to the characters portrayed on the screen.If you haven't caught this film in awhile, I heartily recommend you check it out - it works for young and old alike. A good film to share with children of today, to show them what lush, hand drawn animation looks like. Come for the fun of the Dwarfs and the Villainy of the Evil Queen, stay for the richness of the tapestry and the attention to detail that a true classic film portrays.Letter Grade: A+10 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)Next Month: WRECK-IT RALPH and (of course) the sequel RALPH BREAKS THE INTERNET (coming to theaters in November).",

            "content": "Derided as Disney's Folly during its production Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs would turn out to be Disney's greatest triumph. How different the world would be had Walt Disney failed with Snow White. This was the first full-length animated feature. If it did not succeed there wouldn't be any others. At least not for a very, very long time. No Pinocchio, no Bambi, all the way up to probably no Toy Story. Because if Snow White failed there would be no Disney as we know it. And if there's no Disney the history of film, animation and all of entertainment is quite different. So much of what we have known and embraced all these decades goes back to a fairy tale princess and seven of her closest, shortest friends.Considering an animation project of this magnitude had never been undertaken it is quite remarkable just how magnificent this film looks. The colors pop, the backgrounds are fabulous, the attention to detail is tremendous. The dwarfs look absolutely terrific. Brilliant character design executed wondrously by Disney's team of animators. The personality of each dwarf shines through before any of them even speak, the visuals are so good they tell each character's story perfectly. The animals, and this film's got plenty of animals, all look great. The villainous queen, in both her incarnations, is a sight to behold. Oddly, perhaps the least visually appealing thing in the whole film is Snow White herself. She's really not all that much to look at. A flat, almost featureless face. She's an iconic film character, Disney's most famous and beloved princess. But truth is she's a bit of a plain Jane. Fairest of them all? In this case the visual doesn't quite sell that story. And her prince is a bit of a dud too. But as a whole the art and animation on display here is quite terrific, and considering the laborious process by which it was created, a little miraculous.Could the world truly be captivated by a cartoon? In 1937 most people didn't think so. A five-minute short, that's one thing. An 83-minute feature? No way a cartoon could hold the attention for that long. Wrong. Admittedly there are times when the film's story does drag. Some sequences do nothing to advance the plot, they just pad the running time to an acceptable feature length. Snow White herself is not a particularly interesting character so the film doesn't really kick into high gear until the dwarfs are introduced. They give the film its personality. They give the film a song you'll be humming for hours after the film ends. They gave the film its humor but also gave it its emotional heart. The bond they form with Snow White is what allows the film's ending to pack such an emotional wallop. Yes, a cartoon can provoke genuine, heartfelt feeling. As it is that ending may be a bit rushed. The story wraps itself up and it's The End before you know what hit you. When it's over you can look back and see there is so much to appreciate. Walt Disney gambled big and won. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is not a perfect film, some parts work better than others. But there is no denying it was a magnificent achievement for its time. It is still thoroughly enjoyable all these years later. And it is well worth its iconic place in film history.",

It contains very fluid animation on top of very detailed backgrounds. It is also very atmospheric, with the mood changing from scary to happy and joyful a few times. The songs were very wonderful and catchy. The actress who voiced Snow White had a very nice and unique voice. I also thought Hi Ho and the other song the dwarfs sing were very fun and ridiculously catchy. And of course it also had a very beautiful score.Although there were some things keeping it from a perfect ten. The character of Snow White can at times be irritating in her flawlessness and purity. It felt like the prince was tacked on last minute as a deus ex machina. It seems with most Disney films at the time, the only enjoyable characters are the side characters and the villain. This movie is mostly loved because of the dwarfs. And who couldn't love those guys? They were hilarious. And the Queen was, of course, very menacing and scary.It could also be argued that the movie had a lot of filler. Almost all Disney movies were full of filler in Walt's time. But most people don't really care, probably because of how entertaining the filler usually is.This movie is definitely recommended to all animation fans, and those of us who are still children inside.",

However, the very first of them all was \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", an adaptation of the version of the story from the Brothers Grimm. This 1937 motion picture turned out to be groundbreaking, and although seven decades have passed since its original release, it is still remembered as a classic, well-deservingly! Snow White is a princess, and the stepdaughter of the evil, vain Queen. One day, when the Queen asks her Magic Mirror \"Who is the fairest one of all?\", she doesn't get her usual response! Instead, she learns that Snow White is now the \"fairest one of all\"! The Queen immediately grows jealous, and sends a hunter out to kill Snow White! Luckily for the princess, the hunter decides that killing her just wouldn't be right. Wanting her to live, he tells her to run away, which is just what she does. Looking for a place to stay, she ends up in the house of the Seven Dwarfs (Dopey, Sleepy, Sneezy, Doc, Bashful, Grumpy, and Happy), and begins to live with them. Meanwhile, after the Queen learns that Snow White is still alive, she intends to do the killing herself!This was one of many Disney films that I saw when I was a kid, but my memory of it wasn't as clear as some of the others. A few months ago, I watched it for the first time in many years, and didn't think much of it. However, I was more impressed when I watched it again shortly after, and even more impressed with a third viewing! I found Snow White's singing voice somewhat annoying at first, and with more viewings, I still didn't become a big fan of it. However, this certainly didn't totally ruin the film for me. \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" has some good dialogue (some of which I may not have noticed before), excitement, and memorable characters (including Snow White, even if she's not the greatest character in Disney history, along with most of the Dwarfs, who often add humour to the film).After my most recent viewing, I'm not sure whether to give \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" an 8 or a 9 (out of 10, of course). I certainly wouldn't give it a 10 (it's not absolutely perfect in my book), but I was very impressed with most of it. I don't know whether it was enough for me to give it a 9 rating or not. Well, nonetheless, I can still understand why this first full-length piece of animation from Disney has been labelled a classic by so many people throughout the decades! For hardcore fans of Disney or animated family adventures in general, and probably for some moderate fans as well, there's lots of fun to be had!",

While I understand most the context of the story is dated, it still wants you to suspend disbelief. Keep in mind, the girl talks to woodland creatures. In Walt's mind, he probably thought no one is stupid enough to take this seriously. Not so, apparently. So, here's the thing...the message. What exactly is the message? Simple: envious, bitter people will do a lot to stop people with a dream. Yep, the people who dogged this film are those people.

It is as impossible to dislike this movie as it is to dislike Snow White herself. The songs are memorable,the dwarfs unforgettable and the Queen menacing. This was one of the first Disney movies i saw, and it is as good now as it was the first time i saw it ! It's timeless masterpiece about a wonderful person(Snow White)and her quest to find love and you root for her all the way. This also has a great Swedish dubbing courtesy of Doreen Denning the queen of dubbing animated films to Swedish. Her dubbs always keeps high quality! and this is no exception.This movie comes highly recommended !",

I have asked myself the question \"is this movie really 80 years old by now\"? and the fact that it actually is still astounds me. In my lifetime the company has made movies which looked less than half as good as Snow White despite the available technology, therefore it has a special place in my heart. But that said, I honestly think that Snow White as a character is quite a bore. She surely has the beautiful singing voice of Adriana Caselotti, but she is too cute and innocent to be interesting. In addition to that, the scenes involving her and the prince are just awkward, both of the times they meet. The dwarfs and the evil queen are by far the greatest characters in this movie.\"Snow White and the Seven Dwafs\" is highly recommendable if you like animation as a craft.",

            "content": "The first of Walt Disney's historic features was a pleasure to watch. Beautifully animated with deceptively gentle strokes, we are delicately guided through the Brothers Grimm's fairy tale. But this is still a fairy tale and a 1930\u2032s film, made at a time where stories were not so toned down for our children, and a healthy dose of fear and horror was not shied away from.Snow White is definitely a ditsy princess, so innocent that her counter has to be the personification of pure evil and she certainly is. The Queen, represents some of our darkest emotions, and there is little effort to tone this down, which I liked, a lot. She is evil, driven by her vain jealously to firstly attempt to have Snow White murdered, and then failing that, to poison her into a narcoleptic state and have her buried alive! Is this what you now think of a s Disney film, with a U rating? No, but thanks to this and the following films successes, this is a prized classic and untouchable. I think that this is a true family movie, with as much darkness as there is light, with some great musical numbers, indelible characters and an animation style which is truly timeless.I mean this is a musical which was made in Technicolor less than ten years after the innovation of sound was introduced to black and white films. This is a film which children feel a part of and don't even compare to black and white's of the same era, which of course, they hate and don't feel are real.Hats off to Walt, who I must admit, I've never really been a fan of, but I'm working my way through his classics and am liking what I am seeing so far",

Maybe the songs are not the best, or the animation is less than perfect. Certainly the voices (particularly Snow White herself) are not the voices you wan to hear necessarily. But put it all in context.This was, for all practical purposes, the first full-length animated feature. One can argue about earlier films (and rightly so), but this is the one that took the world by storm, sold millions of tickets and became part of American culture.

The characters are all intriguing (except the Prince), and you are rooting for the good guys. Snow White is a sweet, naive protagonist and even though she is not the most active Disney Princess, you want her to get her happy ending. The Dwarfs each have their own unique, and funny personality, and they are clearly the most interesting characters of the film. Queen Grimhilde is just so bitter and ruthless, and she does her job as a villain extremely well. You don't see much of the Prince, but he is an alright guy, and is good for Snow White.The animation is pretty good for the time it was made in, but it does have a few inconsistencies, like the movement of the characters, but it was the first animated feature, so it's alright.The story is pretty close to the Fairy Tale book, and is dedicated to that. There is no problem with the plot at all, but the filler scenes are a bit too long. All of the films in Walt's era has filler in it and that is alright, but in this film, it is a bit too long and some drag o. longer than its welcome. The songs are brilliant and bring you up. Th classic songs like \"Heigh Ho\", and \"Someday My Prince Will Come\" add more depth into our characters and the story. PerfectIf you are on a nostalgic trip, and/or want entertainment for children, this film is perfect. It is iconic for a reason",

I saw it again 7 years later (back then Disney films were reissued every 7 years at theatres) and was bored silly. Just saw the digitally restored version on DVD. It LOOKS incredible with bright colors and beautiful animation but I still don't like it.The story is sssloooowwww and the character of Snow White is given NO characterization at all! She's just SO sweet and SO innocent that you just want to hit her. The Prince barely figures in this. The music and songs were terrible! \"Whistle While You Work\" and \"Someday My Prince Will Come\" were (kind of) cute but way too sweet. Also they're sung at such a high pitch they could break glass! The dwarfs are annoying and obnoxious and act like a gang of badly behaved children. Their \"comical\" antics were anything but. Only the animals come across as nice. Also the sexism is horrific. Snow eagerly agrees to keep house for the dwarfs for no good reason whatsoever. Yet when the Prince awakens her she has no problem running off with him to be \"happily\" married! I realize this was made over 70 years ago for kids but that doesn't excuse it. I acknowledge the film does have an important place in film history but I found it slow, stupid and boring.

One of those films was \"Snow white and the seven dwarfs.\" one of the earliest animated films based upon an old fairy tale.

She doesn't really have a name, just the Evil queen. she owns a magic mirror, whom she asks \"Who's the fairest one of all?\" and that mirror is supposed to say \"you, fair queen.\" but one day it decides to mention Snow white's name. This forces Snow White to run away.The fairy tale of snow white strikes a chord in everybody's heart, and the film itself is epic, even by today's standards.However, I think it's one of the scariest children's films of all time, and if the Walt Disney company ever made another film like this today, All the soccer moms and high school musical crybabies and fanboys would call for it's boycotting.I give it a full 10/10.

            "content": "So, I've decided to watch and review all Disney animated classics, their sequels and TV shows. Naturally, I started with \"Snow White,\" which (prepares body armour) I'd never seen.The story is based on the Brother's Grimm tale,and was the first ever fully animated motion picture, released in 1937. It was Adolf Hitler's favourite movie. The more you know.Within, we have Snow White, a pale skinned, raven haired beauty who trusts everyone like a derpy puppydog, but is so nice you can't help but enjoy her. She is the prettiest in the land, much to the unease of her stepmother, the Evil Queen. Queenie orders her loyal huntsman to off Snow, but she is just so smexy and innocent that he balks, and lets her go. Snow runs through the forest in terror, only to come across some friendly animals, who guide her to a humble cottage owned by seven dwarfs. The dwarfs agree she can stay, and in return Snow offers to keep house. Everything is fine and dandy, until Queenie discovers that Snow is NOT dead, that the heart she requested is a pig's, so she magics herself into an ugly hag, creates a poison apple and sets off to do Snow in herself.The story is simple, and Snow isn't the most amazing heroine, but she is nice. REALLY nice. She happy and chipper, yet quite assertive in the do-as-your-mother-says way. Her curiosity and innocence is both endearing and grating; her excitement over a tiny chair is just too sweet, yet her swooning over this hunky prince dude is just blegh, but maybe I'm just a cynic. Snow meshes well with her dwarf pals, and has a likable, soothing aura, which is saying something for an animated character. The dwarfs are good fun, and are easily the highlight of the movie. Each have their own distinct personality and each gets to shine through, hell they even look very different, kudos to that! They couldn't do that in the Hobbit where there was like, twenty of them? My favourite was Grumpy; I just love the old curmudgeon with the heart of gold. When he's the first one to jump on a deer to save Snow I was cheering on the inside, haha.Where the film truly stands out is the animation and backgrounds. The colours, even though not as bright as the later Disney films, are still vibrant. The backgrounds are stunning, and I hope Disney do something like \"Bolt\" and bring painterly backgrounds in again. The animation is so smooth, and the musical and comedic timing is spot on, especially in the \"Whistle While You Work\" sequence, however they did that was amazing, it is easily the best part of the film for me. The shading is amazing too, the shadows and different tones make the film come to life. It's truly a moving painting. The music is pretty neat too, what with the score (was some of it reused or used in homage in \"101 Dalmatians years later?) and the timeless songs. Except \"Someday My Prince Will Come.\" Oh my Lord. I'll take the same stance as Grumpy on that one! Overall, \"Snow White\" does hold up pretty damn well, especially in the animation and technical department. The message, well I'm not sure if there is one, but that doesn't matter much. I mean, Snow just barges into the dwarf's house and cleans up the place, she takes the apple from Queenie-Hag after being told by her new pals not to trust anyone. Yet there's the whole never judge the book by it's cover, listen to others, don't trust strangers and be patient. The ending where hunky prince charming comes along to smooch Snow had me thinking, is he like the Grim Reaper? Carrying her up to his castle on the clouds, while the dwarfs say goodbye? The ending was more bittersweet than happy to me, which is interesting.\"Snow White\" is truly a timeless classic, and a magnificent foundation for what was to come from Uncle Walt.",

            "content": "Now I don't want any hate mail (just kidding I do...I love getting emails) but I am scoring this beloved classic a 6. Not because its a bad film, no movie that is considered a stone cold classic and the starting point of one of the biggest film heavyweights in history could be a \"bad\" movie but I review my films on entertainment value to me. I could list pros and cons for this film all day and all night because I feel like it has a lengthy list in both columns. On one hand if you look at it from its conception date in the late 1930's, it is brilliant, breathtaking animation. The artistic value on this film is a 20 out of 10. Still today you have to marvel at the beautiful hand drawn art and characters. But you could argue against me until you're blue in the face but I believe this is a movie that could have been told in ten minutes. They drag it out and there is many scenes in the film that are simply too long. Its an extremely dark film (as many of Disney's adventures tend to be) so much so that I personally wouldn't let very young children watch it. And while most of the songs are iconic and lovely, they are far from the best in the Disney animation classic repertoire.Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs created some of the most iconic well known figures in animation history or film history for that matter. Out of all the Disney princesses I have always felt that Adriana Caselotti was the least impressive of the bunch. There are times when her singing voice is almost irritating like sandpaper and her tones are off in various scenes. I don't know why Walt Disney took such a liking to her but she didn't do much else outside of this so I think I may be closer to hitting the nail on the head than you would think. Lucille La Verne is very good as the evil Queen cementing her place in animated villainy quite purposefully. I felt like in this most recent viewing that she was actually almost underused in the film but she does get some terrific and terrifying scenes. Each one of the seven dwarfs are fantastic. They all have such unique (albeit blatantly obvious) personalities. Everyone will find their favourite and while some get more scenes than others, they are terrific. Harry Stockwell as the Prince...well I can't say much of anything about his performance because he is probably the most underused Prince in Disney history. There is no build up to their romance and every scene he is in is very rushed and forced.That is perhaps my biggest issue with the film. So much of it dragged and too much time was spent trying to fill empty void in an effort to make it feature length and then when you hit the climax of her eating the apple...it rushes right through to the end and credits are rolling before you even know what happened. The last ten or fifteen minutes are far too rushed and compact. This film holds its credibility because of what it did for Disney studios and animation and the characters that became so iconic. The six directors that worked on this film deserve most of that credit because it really is a beautiful film to look at. Even the background of each sequence is just lovely. For me, it was a bit of a dud in a few ways but I can appreciate artistic beauty and this film is full of that at the very least. 6/10",

            "content": "Walt Disney's first full length feature, animated, and in color, is now regarded as a classic above criticism. Well, while it is a huge achievement, especially for 1937, it IS a little thin on story.Set in a European-esque fairytale world, Snow White is the pretty young Princess living under the shadow of her evil stepmother the Queen. Envious of her beauty she orders her huntsmen to lead her out into the woods and cut her heart out. He gets the first bit right, but chickens out on the actual heart-cutting. Instead he banishes her to the woods where she promptly invades a private home, claiming it for herself, and enslaves the forest animals to do her bidding.When the rightful owners return they are first alarmed but then happy to have a woman living in the house to seize their passions and cook their dinners. I assume that all dishes served in Casa De Dwarf are all vegetarian since we never actually see Snowy kill, skin, and butcher the animals that she has enslaved.Eventually the Queen learns that Snowy is still alive and aims to kill her with a poisoned apple (that can be reversed by a kiss from her true love). Why she doesn't just slit her throat or burn the house down is beyond me.There are not really enough developments in the story to maintain the 83-minute running time, with a lot of space devoted to singing and rhythm-timed animation in the style of Silly Symphonies. But the animation, and especially the backgrounds, are wonderful to look at and really do create an atmospheric, beautiful world. It's a shame Disney didn't indulge in them more.Still a classic, but perhaps a little too quaint from a modern point-of-view.",

            "content": "A man named Walt Disney changed movie goers lives forever when he started his first film called Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs. Before this of course was Steamboat Willie(which is now used in the Walt Disney Animation Studios as its logo). Everyone knows what this film is about,a young princess named Snow White is threatened by her evil stepmother the Queen who wants her dead(cause she wants to be the fairest one of all)so Snow White hides out in a nearby cottage with her animal buddies to keep her safe and its turns out that the cottage belongs to seven dwarfs including Dopey,Bashful,Sleepy,Sneezy,Grumpy,Doc and Happy(all these are personality traits that each dwarf has). So when the dwarfs arrive on the scene Snow White explains to them that her stepmother is trying to kill her and so they help her out. But when later on in the film,when the wicked queen catches her in the cottage disguised as an old begger woman,its up to the dwarfs to save her from the evil woman.Lets face it Walt Disney wouldn't have happened only for this film. Disney today sure has changed as gone are the hand drawn films and now its all CGI films like Frozen,Big Hero 6 and of course Disney's 50th Tangled. As far as I know I think Snow White was the film that I watched as a child and now at the age of 24 I still love Disney movies to this day no matter what age I am.Good: The Animation is beautiful and the characters are engaging. The songs are memorable too especially the cute love ballad Someday My Prince Will Come.Bad: Snow White is a really irritating character. She has this piercing voice that drives you mad it even gets worse when she sings. Also does anyone of you notice that Snow White,Aurora and Cinderella all have one thing in common........there princes. I swear Snow White's prince is so bland,so boring his just not that great at all and it was a shame that Snow White hadn't got any screen-time with him except for the I'm Wishing song. Also the ending is a bit weird,like why was the castle up in heaven for anyway?But still having said this I truly loved this movie. Is it the best animated film(well its a yes and no answer for me cause like I said without Snow White we wouldn't have DisneyLand or Euro Disney or anything Disney and our lives well wouldn't be as engaging without the man himself who died in 1966 and now its over by John Lasseter(the man responsible for Pixar in 1995) who changed Walt Disney Pictures to just Disney.8.6/10 B-",

This film alone is the reason why animation is so strong and how Walt Disney became a king in the full-length animation industry. Certainly a lot better than the CG biz that we're seeing today. This film has got everything that we could hope for, a golden story, fantastic animation, & great characters, also there are a combination of emotions felt throughout the film, charm for Snow White and the Dwarfs, but at certain moments, that charm is outweighed by the horror elements from who might be the best Disney Villain to date. All in all, this film can either make u cry, laugh hysterically, or, like I was when I was little, make u jump off of your pants when u see the Witch, but either way, this piece of history is something that we all should see at anytime of our lives.",

Snow White is a \"slave\" to her stepmother, \"The Queen\"( voiced beautifully by Lucille La Verne), but while doing all her work, she thinks of a prince and a brand new life for herself. Through many different events, (such as running through a dark and scary forest) Snow White reaches a cottage which is home to seven dwarfs. I wont say anymore, but the events that happen here are truly magical and add up well to the films exciting and maybe a little scary climax.For a film made in 1937, this was quite ahead of its time. No one ever heard of someone producing a full length animated feature, and they thought the idea was completely absurd. Boy, did Disney prove them wrong! Modern film and animation owes a great deal to this film and all of the innovative things about it.If you are looking to view this film and you don't currently own it, it might be hard to track down. The DVD version of the film is in \"The Vault\"(Disney has a nasty way of doing this sort of thing) and the only way to get it would be through a site like eBay or Amazon, or seeing if any Used DVD stores or your local Video Rental Store has any to sell. An alternative would be to see it on VHS if you have VHS player and the Snow White VHS.All in all, this has to be one of my favorite films of all time, and I still like to curl up under a blanket with some popcorn whilst watching this movie.10/10= Highly Recommended",

            "content": "Since the 1930's, Disney animated films have been a strange collection. Some are made to present new ideas in story and animation and push the limits of the genre of animated film.  Others have been purely formulatic and meant as little more than money makers.  But overall, there have been more hits than misses (at least with their feature film animation).  Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs really did push the revolution.A few years shy of 70, the film still holds up really well, especially with the remastered print and even moreso on DVD.  It's the other animated character (besides a certain mouse) that built the house of Disney, and it's obvious as to why when seen.  It's a beautiful film, with great animation, a simple story and at the risk of sounding like a press release, truly unforgettable songs and characters.  It's a part of American film history, up there with \"Casablanca\" and \"Citizen Kane\", and even the more modern classics like \"Star Wars\" and \"Indiana Jones\".  It's aged well, and it shows why sometimes simplicity is truly the way to go in terms of presenting a story.  It has a straightforward manner with plenty of visual marvels, especially when you sit back and realize how long this film has been around, and how even some animation of today still can't compare.The DVD itself is filled with more background information than a person can watch in one sitting.  It really makes up for the initial discs released by Disney DVD, and bodes well for later classics such as \"Aladdin\", \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"Lion King\" and \"Sleeping Beauty\" (Can you tell which ones I'm waiting for?).A must see for any film animation fan, but you probably already knew that.",

It follows the story of a young girl who doesn't know that she's the fairest one of all. But the evil Queen does know this and will stop at nothing to rid the world of her beauty. Even if it means losing the Queen's own beauty.The Queen sends someone to kill Snow White, but the man who has to fulfill the dirty deed cannot go through with it and sets Snow White free into the forest. She stumbles upon a vacant cottage in the heart of the wilderness. She naps there and is awakened by what she describes as little men.These men learn to love Snow White as a friend and they live together in peace until the Queen learns that the beautiful girl is still alive and must destroy Snow White herself.Even today that storyline is a little complex for most children. Yet everyone who sees it seems to love it and cherish it in their heart. It was the first of its kind and who knew that it would also end up being the best? This put Disney on the map as a major studio and also paved the way for the animated feature film.It's definitely something you can't pass up and something you must show to your own children while they are young.

When Snow White flees into the forest, we see what she sees--that the whole world is suddenly out to get her.  The trees come to life in demonic fashion, and the floating logs become crocodiles.A note on the songs--while today in America it seems kind of silly to have songs about working and cleaning, work songs have been a part of nearly every culture throughout history.

This landmark film, the very first full length animated feature, belongs on the short list of the most influential American movies of the Twentieth Century. If Mickey Mouse was the rock on which the House of Disney was built, then SNOW WHITE and the SEVEN DWARFS was the cement that helped form the Disney conglomerate as we know it today.Rudimentary by today's standards, SNOW WHITE nevertheless remains a masterpiece of animation because it possesses two qualities totally lacking in most of today's computerized works : Heart and Soul. Despite the advancement in technology, regardless of the magic of pixels and virtual imagery, most present-day animated features lack basic storytelling skills, relying rather on the easy clever remark and an annoying tendency to preach than tell a good tale. And nothing can compare to the inspired and solid craftsmanship of Disney's original \"old man \"team of animators who bravely learned their trade while creating this nascent work of art. SNOW WHITE is the cornerstone of all of Walt Disney's greatest animated films : an involving story, characters the audience can care for and identify with, superbly drawn animation put into brilliant motion and heightened by the innovative use of the then revolutionary multi-plane camera ( a device that dramatically changed the look of cartoons, giving scenes a third dimensional look). Added to all these innovations were the remarkable songwriting contributions of Frank Churchill and Leigh Harline, responsible for the superb musical score.\"Someday My Prince Will Come\", Heigh Ho\" and \"Whistle While You Work' are just three examples of an entire soundtrack that is a model of perfection and to this day one of the great movie song scores of all time. One could go on and remark on the incredible detail afforded the dwarfs' home, the wood sculpturing that adorns everything from the little mens' beds to stair-posts and doorknobs.The detail is astonishing, and the blood and sweat of the animators' labors will forever be enshrined in this lasting work of art.",

Our impressive little minds were not tarnished by any stereotyping of the dwarfs or the ugly witch or anything else.

Eventually, this movie would become the blueprint for their future work and, after all years, the timeless fairy tales are still their most enduring trademark. Fortunately, they have the financial means to maintain their work and this movie has been restored already a couple of times and it looks quite amazing. Of course, they would improve and/or diversify their technique through the years but this one was already quite gorgeous to look at. To be honest, even though the story was charming and the dwarfs pretty hilarious, the plot was decent but not really strong, in my opinion. For example, they spent half of the running time with Snow White getting to their home and getting acquainted with those fellows while everything involving the prince was seriously underwritten. Indeed, nowadays, this whole concept of this prince coming up from nowhere and basically saving the day seems rather hard to swallow for the modern audience (see 'Frozen' and 'Maleficent', also both Disney productions).

I will give my undying gratitude to Snow White for starting the undisputed greatest tradition in film history.And honestly, for turning 70 this year, the old dame's held up pretty well. No, it has never been my favourite Disney fairy tale, but it has far more merits than detriments.OK, OK the titular character is about as flat as the paper she's drawn on , gratingly dense, and there's no accounting for taste when choosing the voice (It feels like they were honestly going for 12 years old, which just disturbs contemporary audiences). And the animators definitely showed their weakness when it came to the prince, HOWEVER, the rest is superb. The forest and anything involving the Queen are genuinely terrifying. Many scenes I could not endure when I was little without throwing back my head and howling. So much care and individual quirks are put into the dwarfs.

Snow White is hardly a character. Like the dwarfs, her name is a description; unlike them it is a descriptor of her appearance, not her personality. \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" must have looked like magic up on the big screen in 1937 for adult and child alike, but nowadays there's just not enough going on on screen to hold our attention.

            "content": "Since everyone knows what happens here, I'll talk about a few aspects. In the Grimm brothers' original version, the dwarfs didn't have names; Disney added those and the respective personalities. Also, whereas here the dwarfs are slobs, in the original story they were very tidy - so why did they need Snow White to be a housekeeper? Today was the very first time in my life that I watched the whole movie (and I only watched it for a class). The first time when I saw any of it was in \"Gremlins\", when the mean green guys watched it. Also, I remember once on \"The Brady Bunch\" when the Bradys put on a production of it in their back yard to raise money for a retiring teacher.One thing that comes to my mind is the fact that there are seven dwarfs. We all like to say that seven's the lucky number. Considering the names and personalities given the little guys here, one could infer that they represent the seven deadly sins: Grumpy is anger; Sleepy is sloth; Sneezy is greed (maybe he thinks that everyone owes him something because of his excessive sneezing); Bashful is lust; Doc is pride (if he's smarter than the others, he must be full of himself); Happy is gluttony (you may recall that he's pretty fat); and Dopey is envy (maybe he wishes that he was as smart as the others and talk like them). Expanding on this, maybe the dwarfs correlate to the characters on \"Gilligan's Island\": Gilligan is Dopey; the Skipper is Grumpy; Mr. Howell is Sleepy (he'd rather sleep than do work); Mrs. Howell is Sneezy (she seems like the type who's allergic to many things); Ginger is Bashful; the Professor is Doc; and Mary Ann is Happy. Speaking of dwarfs in general, I think that dwarfs are people whose limbs or other body parts are disproportionate to the rest, so the men here would be midgets.Oh, wait a minute. I haven't even mentioned Snow White. Well, we all know that she's benevolent beyond credibility - and she's rather flat-chested for a grown woman. Watching the movie in this day and age, a person may feel tempted to throw out comments like on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\". When Snow White looked down the well, I said that it was like \"The Ring\", and when she entered the dwarfs' house, I suggested that she was guilty of breaking and entering.So, that's my take on \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\".

            "content": "Disney's first full length classic animated film, now at 85 years old, is the epitome of what classic animation has strive to be since it was filmed. It's obvious that even \"The Wizard of Oz\" was influenced by this in many ways even though that was a live action film and this is a cartoon. Lucille La Verne is an actress whose name has faded to history, but those who research the film will be surprised to discover that she was once a very famous stage actress who even had a Broadway theater named after her for a short time. For classic movie fans, she'll be always remembered as hag characters in two French revolution-based classics, \"Orphans of the Storm\" and \"A Tale of Two Cities\", and is well known to me for playing memorable supporting roles in \"Little Caesar\", \"Pilgrimage\", and a larger part as a loveable Southern matron in the Wheeler and Woolsey comedy \"Kentucky Kernels\". She is sensational in the voiceover role of both the wicked queen and the hag at the end, with photography of her aged face used as the influence for the drawings which created the character in the last part of this film. Watching her in those two French Revolution classics makes it obvious that her appearance was used in the creation of the old hag who brings Snow White a poisoned apple.It's obvious that kids who watched this when it first came out and in subsequent re-releases were frightened by the horror elements of the film which obviously influenced a great HBO movie featuring Sigourney Weaver as the wicked queen. Other movie versions of the Snow White tale have not been as successful, nor several misguided appearances on the Oscars. Adriana Caselotti provides both the acting and singing voice of Snow White, her voice perhaps a little shrill for modern audiences, but the light operatic style was definitely popular when this was made. Harry Stockwell's singing voice reminds me of Allan Jones who was quite popular in 1937, having had a big hit that year with \"The Donkey Serenade\". Other voices are perfect as well, including the magic mirror, the huntsman and of course those adorable seven dwarfs.So while they're definitely are some elements of this that are extremely corny, corn is one of the sweetest vegetables out there, and the animated animals are quite cute. This film grips you from the very beginning and never let go, and it's easy to see that the structure of the film would continue in other animated classics made beyond the living Walt Disney era into the decades after. This is one of those films that even the most cynical of adults can watch again years after first seeing it and begin to whistle as they watch while Snow White is whistling while she works. And of course there's the classic \"Heigh Ho\" song that totally stands the test of time. This is the type of film that if possible I would rate far beyond perfect, that if you end up in a sentimental mood while viewing it, tears are bound to follow, both out of the joy that this film provides and the sadness that they just don't make films like this anymore.",

I appreciated the animation and the details, especially because of the when this movie first came out. However I was bored to tears, during my childhood I use to watch a lot of Disney movies but this one just didn't stand out to me. It really plays upon a girl's dream of Prince Charming showing up and saving the day from all the troubles of the world. It's cool for when this movie came out, but that doesn't mean I have to act like I enjoyed it or anything like that. I can't call this a timeless masterpiece of anything like that, but I appreciate it. Since this movie was probably the pioneer for other good and great Disney films. I think the only thing that stood out for me when it comes to this flick was the \"Heigh Ho\" part where the dwarfs are singing while going back home from mining. Overall, this is in my opinion a movie to watch in order to see the beginning of Disney and the animation, which was top notch at that time. No offence to Disney or others that liked this, but I personally was very bored with this one.5/10",

In fact, the films true strength is heightened by the simplicity of the story because it allows the film to communicate on a deeper level. The story itself can almost be followed without thinking at all, which lets the subconscious mind grab the film and run with it. One of the best films I've ever seen and currently my favorite Disney movie. It's missing some things that other Disney movies have, but it replaces those elements with something more primal and harder to define.",

            "content": "(WARNING\u0085This is the Adult Disney Review Series. I have 51 Original Disney Cartoons to tackle, plus multiple \u2013 and forgettable \u2013 direct-to-Disney-Video misses. My goal in 2012 is to brave the task of watching all, many for the first time and commenting on each\u0085all with an adult POV. Now, as soon as I can find an adult to do just that\u0085)Ahhh\u0085 Number one. Snow WHITE and the seven \"little men.\" Like Walty Boy isn't trying to say something there. Don't count him out of adding subliminal messages throughout his works. And I'm not just talking about the Little Mermaid's Little Penis. I'm talking even smaller, as in using the phrase here \"Jiminy Cricket\" (repeatedly) or his hatred for things, well, not (snow) WHITE.Admittedly, I'm not the hugest fan of this animated film. Sure, it's groundbreaking, for 1937, and against all odds, they made the first (of thousands) of feature-length animated films. Keep in mind: just because a movie's a milestone doesn't mean it equates greatness.Example? Episode IV, A New Hope, formally just plain Star Wars. Sure it was ahead of its time, light-years, in fact, but wasn't it a fraction of the movie, Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back, formally just plain Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back?Why was this, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, not the \"Great\" movie tons of critics attribute it to be? Oh, I don't know\u0085because there's a lot of racism in here \u2013 from mocking the Chinese to the Native Americans? Because the lead singer (and voice) of Snow White sounds like she's sucking on chestnuts (not the dwarfs, I hope) whenever she opens her lips? Or is it the painful pacing?That last one got me. Sure, they wanted to make the first full feature length cartoon, but it still felt like a couple-of-minutes-long short stretched far too long in most scenes. It is said, in the truthful, and masterful sometimes Walt Disney-HIMSELF!, commentary on the DVD, that Walt wanted only scenes that enhanced the character development. Unfortunately, it still felt like scenes dragged longer than they should.I'll give it creativity. It's beautiful for what it was trying to be. It's also VERY adult. There's more than one scene of someone trying to kill someone else. Only, the Queen's evil plan was a little misconstrued. See, she sends her minion (apparently, she's just got one servant) to kill Snow White so the Queen can retain the \"Fairest of them all\" status. But then, she spends a good portion of screen time to transform into an ugly hag in order to trick Snow White into eating an apple and fall asleep. Luckily the writers caught the obvious flaw of a cure, but not the fact that there were plenty of opportunities for the witch/queen to simply stab the beauty instead of just putting her to sleep.More things that irate me: Grumpy, apparently one of the \"main characters\" \u2013 due to a higher amount of screen time than many of the other Smurfs in the movie, is a dick. Plain and simple. Sure, he evolves and Snow White spends a good portion of the movie attempting to get him to like her. But, he's still a nasty character in any lighting. Also, the extremely over-dramatic Snow White is no princess\u0085she never, EVER, shows appreciation for any of the nice things anyone does for her. I.E. the animals bend over backwards to find her shelter. She never, ever offers or says: \"thanks.\" The dwarfs care more about her than themselves in many occasions, such as places to sleep or when she \"eternally\" sleeps, and when she awakes, it's all about her wishes. Bitch.For die-hard Disney fans, it's a watch. It's not terrible; it's a good beginning and despite its flaws, I'm glad they (and the box office) had faith in Walty Boy to grant him further production deals, leading up to Disneyland, et al. Just don't be proclaiming it the \"masterpiece\" that people on the surface call it.Now\u0085onto Pinocchio",

The characters of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs are all charming, lovable and memorable. They all stand out in there own way, but my favourite is Dopey even though he doesn't say anything but as Walt Disney himself put it \"He's nice but sort of silly\". But that's what I like about him; he's clumsy and funny. This film is a classic in it's own way and it was one of the highest grossing films ever around the time it was first released. And it's enjoyable for both kids and adults. And it's also one of the few films that made me cry. I mean, yes, the film made me smile a lot because it's such a charming feature but the scene where Snow White is in sleeping death and the seven dwarfs gathered around her and crying is such a sad scene that it made me cry as well. But it's ending is very uplifting when the Prince kisses Snow White and breaks the sleeping death and they all live happily ever after.",

            "content": "Nowadays it's hard to imagine the impact, the popularity and the fascination cartoons and comic strips had for the American public \u2014 especially in the Golden Years from around 1930 to 1950. \"All newspapers have news, but only one newspaper has The Gumps!\" proudly proclaimed The Chicago Sun (and scores of affiliated newspapers across the country). Such a slogan would be meaningless to 99% of today's readers (and absolutely risible to the other 1%). Since the 1950s, cartoons and comic strips have generally been regarded as third-rate fodder for children. However, there are always riders to every sweeping statement. The exceptions here are Fantasia (especially in its 1970's re-issue when it was taken up by the hallucinogenic generation) and \"L'il Abner\" which enjoyed a surprising bout of adult popularity in the 1960s and 1970s. In my childhood days, the comic strip and the comic book were regarded as less than praiseworthy amusements that older children were encouraged to out-grow; and the theatrical cartoon was a mindless diversion for backward youngsters whose limited attention spans were incapable of taking in a whole feature like Lassie Come Home or National Velvet. In my home town, the situation was even worse. There was never a cult following for Tex Avery, and adult cartoons like Fritz the Cat fell flat at the box-office. Despite his macabre humor, Disney was always regarded as strictly for kids. Adults couldn't care less whether Mickey Mouse had three fingers or four, whether Bambi lost a hundred mothers, whether Snow White lived or died. Because I loved cartoons, I was regarded as brain-damaged or eccentric. Often I found myself the lone adult in an audience of irritable children who found films like \"Dumbo\" way above their heads. I have similar happy memories of Pinocchio, Alice in Wonderland, Gay Purree, The Lady and the Tramp, Ichabod and Mr Toad and Mr Bug Goes To Town. (Hey There, It's Yogi Bear, and A Man Called Flintstone, I loathed. I felt they were designed for mental zombies!) However, the animated feature I love best of all is Snow White. It's a film I can enjoy over and over. Snow White herself may be a bit pallid, but the Wicked Queen and the seven dwarfs are brilliantly characterized. The songs are a joy, the animation often dazzlingly inventive, the colors and compositions a visual delight. The story has pace, charm, atmosphere, humor and excitement. If you are immune to its call, and if its music doesn't stir your soul, you're missing one of the seven wonders of the cinema.",

I mean I'd rather watch this film (which is not perfect technically regarding today's standards) than watch Godzilla, The Avengers or Mission to Mars again. I honestly must say that the theme of the film has an approach that is well kind early 20th century but hey that's when it was made and although I didn't like that aspect very much I still enjoyed this film more than I did 2001's Artificial Intelligence (just to name one). The execution of the theme might be a bit old as may the animation techniques, but the good thing is that great humoristic scenes never lose their effect. My favorite dwarf? That's easy DOPEY.

The songs are pretty amazing too, they're really memorable, some are pretty catchy, some are beautiful to listen to.In terms of the characters, they're pretty entertaining too, i admit that i wasn't too crazy about Snow White herself but boy, do i love the dwarfs, each of them have their own personalities that make then distinct, and they're also pretty funny, especially dopey, they will really make you laugh, and i absolutely loved it every time they were on screen, and the queen herself is very intimidating, she doesn't really come off as a generic villain, her serious facial expressions and the ominous music that plays when she's on-screen really make her somewhat intimidating.In conclusion, Snow White is pretty much a masterpiece, it started both the disney animated canon and animated feature films on a very high note.

It has an unintentional negative message for children in the ending as well.Still, this movie is important & not just as a historic first. This movies success is a primary reason that the 1939 Wizard of Oz was produced. Because this film sold so many tickets was a major reason for the way Oz was produced & why MGM spent so much money & time producing it 2 years later. MGM wanted to make the kind of money Disney made on this one.Snow White has declined because of the story factors, but she usually still graces Disney World with her presence.",

            "content": "It is not an surprise that I think that Snow White is one of the greatest and most important movies in history. It is the start of the medium animation, and the first of an almost continuous line of fantastic movies by Walt Disney. Does this film still hold up after almost 80 years? Of course it does.Let us begin with the animation. Even after 77 years, it still is one of the best examples of Disney animation at it's best. It is flu- wend, colorful and the use of Walt's multi plane camera (a device that created the illusion of depth) is fantastic.Because this is Walt's first feature animated movie, they use a simple story. I won't tell the plot in this review, because you all have seen this film so it is pointless to tell something that you all already know. There is no point explaining the plot because this is the kind of film in which everything else is more important than the plot.And now the characters. To be honest, Snow White is not the greatest character in this film, even Walt Disney him self sad that she is basically an plot device. I do not say that she is a bad character. she is good, but the only other complain I have with her is that her voice is ridiculously high. I have heard Adriana Caselotti in the Wizard of Oz and there she sounds normal. And now the thing everyone remembers of this movie: The dwarfs. Thy are some of the best characters ever created in any movie. The evil queen is also great, especially when she is turned into the witch.All the songs are great and fantastic. My favorites are: High Ho, the washing song, the silly song and some day my prince will come. For some reason Disney didn't own the rights of the songs ever since 1937, because it didn't have his own music department yet.It still is one of the greatest Disney movies ever, and one of the greatest movies ever. To the one or two people who didn't saw the movie: Go to the store and buy it!!! it is an must own for everyone.",

This full-length movie was a plan of Walt Disney's to make after he and the studio earned enough revenue to pay for its production by many cartoon shorts with some including Mickey Mouse, known as the \"silly symphonies.\" The movie/cartoon Snow White is a very special family film intended for children of all ages.

            "content": "Disney's first foray into feature filmmaking finds the now legendary animation studio scripting history, for Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs was the first full-length traditionally animated film back then and is still counted amongst their crowning achievements. Its creative brushstrokes, simplistic storytelling & childish humour does have a charm to it but this was still a chore to sit through.Directed by David Hand, the story is based on the German fairy tale of the same name but this adaptation is a tad too simple, sugary sweet & excessively juvenile for my taste. And while I do appreciate the craft behind every frame rendered on screen with care, colours & creativity, the bland storytelling & saccharine execution is just too much to handle sometimes and makes the ride almost unbearable.Considering what the premise is all about, its 83 mins runtime is rather overlong & spread out to allow the animators to conjure their hand-crafted magic on screen. It is visually arresting at first but the interest begins to fizzle out soon & patience also starts to run thin, for there isn't enough material to keep it afloat and even the gags don't have that amusing quality to them anymore. It is tiresome, boring & tediously paced.Overall, Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs is no doubt an aesthetic & artistic triumph and can still surprise some newcomers but it nevertheless left me unmoved & unstimulated for the most part just like few other classics of the same era. While there is beauty in its simplicity & innocence on its surface, there is also boredom in its drawn-out narration plus the film hasn't aged well either. In short, one time viewing is more than enough.",

            "content": "An evil queen takes out her jealousy on her sweet natured step-daughter Snow White.There is plenty of information out there telling you how the movie was made so rather than go into detail, I'll just say that it's staggering to think that it was hand drawn by a number of animators who had not done anything of this magnitude before.Everything about the visuals are absolutely mesmerising when you consider how well it holds up to an audience in the twenty-first century. My daughter has no concept of its age and she reacts the same to the spectacle of Snow White as she does to Frozen.I can think of so many examples of artistry in the film that I never get tired of watching, so I'll highlight my 3 favourites. Firstly, the reflection and water ripple sequence as Snow White makes her wish at the well. Secondly the brilliant scene as she runs frightened imagining the forrest coming to life and grasping for her. Thirdly all the use of shadow and lightening to create atmosphere in so many different classic scenes.The plot based on the Brother Grimm fairytale contains a Disney Princess formula much used since. Musical numbers, evil older female antagonist, handsome male love interest, transformation, resurrection, cute animals and comedy relief characters. Disney did this to death in the coming years unfortunately, but not in 1937.This is a product of its time. Snow White is not a strong character, she embodies the old fashioned sexist ideals that a woman is a homemaker and her sole purpose in life is to find a man. As bad a message as this for young girls to be given by a piece of pop culture, as long as parents compliment this with plenty of positive role models and an explanation of how the world has changed, there is no need to let it spoil the enjoyment.I have a particularly fond memory of watching this movie with my daughter when she was a three year old looking at the prince kiss Snow White and carry her off to live happily ever after in his castle. I'll never forget her puzzling over what was happening and then asking me if he was Snow White's daddy. In her mind who else could it be? I was absolutely heart broken by the innocence of it.",

The story of seven miners who take in Snow White to avoid the Wicked Queen and to keep house for them is a timeless classic. Almost everyone in the US has seen this feature at least once; and several more than once. The characters created in the film are classic and timeless.

I don't know what achievements world cinema had seen in Animation by 1937 when Talkies were running riot at Box Office and Award shows but i know this that Walt Disney brought Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs and changed Hollywood cinema forever. I don't need to mention how Animated classics have been loved over the years but it is important to acknowledge that it all begun with this film. Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs is so amazing, beautiful, amusing and sweet film that i just couldn't hate it for moment. A fairy tale with fine touch of realistic world doesn't fumble at all and becomes a nostalgic mania. The story itself is so fascinating as we meet a Young and charming Princess who works as a Maid in her own palace because of her stepmother, a vain queen. She falls in love with a handsome Prince then runs away and starts living with Seven Dwarfs in the hills but cruel fate doesn't stop chasing her. I must say, the originality and completeness of the writing made many people to borrow the elements and bring stuff inspired from it. It has been influential for years and will remain so forever because such captivating stories will always work in any era. Creators put all the creativeness and innovative ideas into presentations and how? Possibly upto the last level of thinking of how could you present this scene with magical yet fascinating way. I genuinely felt what else could you derived in cinematic Liberty than this? So freaking awesome it is. Music is fantastic and pleasing which has the legacy for valid reasons. One of the biggest victory for the makers is speeding of the film because audience was experiencing something like this for the first time and if it had been slow and glide then engaging factors would have faltered. Fortunately, the film doesn't have a single useless and boring scene that can be overlooked or skipped even in repeat watch. Direction is just perfect I don't know how to explain it as i am not a kid but still enjoyed it like a kid. The commercial succe of this film was needed or else Hollywood would have never dared to make more Animated flicks and we would have missed many classic films. Nowadays we have so many animated films with innovative and highly intelligent ideas but what Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs archived 8 decades ago is REMARKABLE ! Disney kick-started the animated fantasy world with the bang and with and unforgettable experience. A Must Watch for any age, on any day and any time.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

Directed by David Hand and produced by Walt Disney, it has the participation of great voice actors. The soundtrack is a responsibility of Paul J. Smith, Frank Churchill and Leigh Harline. Nominated for an Oscar for Best Soundtrack, this film earned to Disney the honorary statuette the following year.This film immediately won a place in history. Having been the first Walt Disney feature film, it was decisive for the evolution of what we know as animated film. Since the thirties, this movie has been in the lives of successive generations, despite having had few awards. In fact, its the definitive proof that awards don't immortalize a movie. Its ability to win public every year and persist in people's lives is, ultimately, the absolute consecration of a work of cinema.The script is simple but extraordinarily effective, adapting (almost rewriting and polishing) Grimm Brother's story. Snow White is a pre- teen girl, very naive and pure, as it was considered correct at the time (current audiences prefer a less candid approach). The Queen is the incarnation of evil and the perfect antagonist. The prince is the representation of the honest and faithful man, who saves the girl. And of course, we have the famous Seven Dwarfs, supporting characters who serve as comic element and come directly to the hearts of children, with their defects or characteristics, a rather clumsy way and a huge sense of generosity.The drawings are not as visually pleasing as will become in future films. Pencil lines are quite obvious and the colors are slightly alive. However, this technique was starting so that's something natural. The soundtrack is essential for any movie lover and contains one of the most famous songs from Disney films, \"Heigh Ho\", sung by the dwarfs when they return from their mine. The music perfectly accompanies the film and speak to the public with the same eloquence of the drawings.",

If Snow White would've been a disappointment, perhaps Disney wouldn't even exist today. But instead, the risk paid off and today, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs still stands as one of the best animation films. The film did well in the box office back in 1937 and it allowed Disney to start producing a lot of timeless classics in the years that followed.Snow White is a princess, dressed in rags and reduced to work for the evil queen, who fears the beautiful princess. The queen sends a hunter to murder Snow White and to deliver her heart in a box. The hunter can't commit the murder and tells Snow White to hide herself from the evil queen. Snow White finds a little cottage in the woods were seven dwarfs live, who work in the mines during the day, digging for diamonds, although they don't know why, as they mention in the catchy song 'Heigh Ho'. She cooks for the dwarfs and they start to care for Snow White. Even Grumpy, although he wants you to believe he doesn't. While they are off to the mine, the evil queen pays a visit to the cottage, disguised as an old, ugly beggar. Snow White is unaware of the fact that the beggar is actually the queen, so she invites her into the cottage, takes a bite out of a poisoned apple and dies. The forest animals warn the dwarfs, who chase the queen before she drops off a rock and dies. They bury Snow White in a glass coffin, because they can't bring themselves to bury her in the earth. She gets kissed by a prince, comes back to life and they live happily ever after.The first Disney Classic holds a special place in the hearts of many Disney fans and it's easy to see why that is. Snow White is very enjoyable from the start to the finish. It's not a perfect film, like Beauty and the Beast, but still, it was really groundbreaking for 1937. Just 9 years prior, Disney released Steamboat Willie and it's just unreal considering what Disney managed to accomplish in those 9 years. The animation looks tremendous. There's definitely an eye for detail, as was common with most of the early classics. I really appreciate that style of animation. Details can add a lot. In Snow White, they don't distract from the narrative, which is important. Now what really makes this film such a success are the dwarfs. They are a great collection of compelling characters. I especially like Grumpy, he brings a lot of fun to the table. The other dwarfs are memorable as well. Snow White may not be very interesting and her singing voice is the only thing about this film that feels outdated after 77 years. But her character works good enough to make for a great film. The ending may sound clich\u00e9, but it was the first time they did it, so I don't mind it very much here. Snow White is just an enchanting film that is definitely worth the view.",

When the Queen finds out Snow White is still alive she enacts a plan to get rid of her forever.Released in 1937, Walt Disney's ambitious adaptation of the Grimm Faerie Tale Snow White was met with skepticism from many, including Walt's brother Roy. With the exception of a aborted animated adaptation of Edgar Rice Burrough's John Carter novels at MGM, animation was mostly used for short subjects or featurettes, such as Disney's Silly Symphonies and Alice Comedies. Production was rife with obstacles to the point Disney ended up taking a second mortgage to cover the film's budget. Many Hollywood insiders at the time predicted the film would flop nicknaming the film \"Disney's Foley\", and upon it's release became the highest grossing sound film of all time until it was displaced by Gone with the Wind. All these years later, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarves still carries with it the same glorious animation and emotional resonance that helped redefine the capabilities of animation.It's pretty pointless to critique the plot of something like Snow White (down to the fact Disney themselves seem to do it every other day) and much like the source material from the Brothers Grimm story, you can point out logical leaps, plot holes, or any number of things you can read \"too deeply\" into for the sake of a smug laugh (as the Shrek franchise has built itself upon). The reason the story in Snow White works is because it plays on an emotional level. Snow White representing goodness, kindness, and humility in the face of a queen who's cruel, vindictive, spiteful, and sadistic creates the right dynamic for this type of story to work and draw the audience in making them forget about the fact they are watching a movie let alone all the technical details that have gone into the animation.The animation in Snow White is a gold standard for a reason, and a big reason for that is in how dynamic and versatile it is. The animation is beautiful, it's funny, it's intense, it's atmospheric, and covers pretty much all of the emotional spectrum getting all manner of reactions from audiences which helps create the needed audience investment. Every scene is rich in detail from the first frames with even scenes as seemingly minor as watching the Seven Dwarves sleeping filled with detail and vibrancy. While the dwarves are more rubbery and typical of animation standards, they serve as good points of balance against the more realistic looking woodland creatures or human characters that helps give the film a dynamic movement of all varieties. The animation on the Queen in particular is great because there are two versions of The Queen with a beautiful but very hardened starting model that oozes contempt and superiority, and a disguise model used later that works at bringing the \"true\" form of her character to light.Snow White and the Seven Dwarves along with Wizard of Oz is not just an important film in history, but also an enjoyable and emotional experience that you can't help but get wrapped up in. While years of homage, parody, and nitpicking have etched their ways into our collective minds leading to of course Shrek and its many, many, many clones, even after nearly 90 years its still left an impression and it probably still will for years to come.",

The dwarfs still look fantastic, but Snow White herself and the world itself don't quite look exquisite; Snow White is rather dull, especially her facial expressions. I still have massive respect for those who created this though, obviously.The voice cast, as was usual in the early decades of Disney, are a little forgettable. Adriana Caselotti (White) and Lucille La Verne (Queen) do fine jobs, though it's Pinto Colvig who is most memorable as Grumpy.The premise is a pretty light too, with the main saviour hardly featuring and the antagonist disappearing for relatively large portions. Nonetheless, it's a great film to watch with family as Disney's first production is good fun - the music plays a huge part in that regard.",

But it also stands tall on its own merits, from the bold, unforgettable character designs to the lasting, catchy musical interludes. I'm not sure the studio has ever matched this soundtrack, actually, both in terms of staying power and sheer sing-along-ability.A few unsightly seams might show - clumsy little tricks to avoid the difficult camera angles and puzzling plot machinations to trim troublesome characters (which explains why the charming prince disappears for most of the film) - but animators were literally flying by the seat of their pants here, experimenting on-stage to test the viability of their chosen medium. I could nitpick about a whole lot of small items, but in a broad sense, it's the rare film that can still easily captivate a willing audience after eighty-plus years in the can. That alone is an incredible testament to the dedication, tenacity and enduring skill of the whole team, and the quality of the finished product.

She's not perfect but really who is? Her qualities are overlooked nowadays and it's very disappointing as the morals she teaches us are the ones we should be telling our children and not JUST to do everything independently.

It's weird because I obviously remember the broad strokes of this movie but I definitely forgot a lot of the details and little story notes. I find myself experiencing some real Orwellian doublethink now that I watch this. From a storytelling standpoint... This is not good. Yes, there are some dark moments that were surprising but the actual story here is pretty minimal. The evil queen wants to kill the pretty princess, the princess escapes and then just randomly becomes the house guest of these odd little dudes and teaches them to all stop living like pigs, and then she falls for the MOST OBVIOUS EVIL APPLE EVER. Prince eventually shows up, kisses her, and then just... Done? How is that true love? The princess is so young... Are the dwarves all crotchety old men or are they wee youngins with flowing beards? Regardless why is she just breaking into someone's house and messing with stuff? The animation on Snow White feels... Weird and not quite right. It feels so much like a proto-story that acts as the building block for something else but on its own...But that's where the doublethink sinks in. On the surface, just watching the movie and thinking of nothing else, I'm underwhelmed. But when I start thinking of everything this did for cinema, for animation? Snow White really was the foundation that Disney has built itself on. It changed the game with Snow White and by doing that gave birth to one of, if not the, largest and most successful studios to date. How does that stack up? How exactly do you properly weigh the significance of a film that spawned so much even if it's not necessarily amazing on its own? I often make the argument that Iron Man is the best Marvel movie because the whole franchise owes itself to Stark and Snow White is the exact same thing, I just don't feel that same connection to the material here.I really have to put this on that list of films that are fun to watch for historical purposes, for the cinephiles out there, for the impact is has on cinema but I don't actually enjoy it all that much. In that way, I put it in the same realm as Citizen Kane. The realm of films that, intellectually I am glad to have seen but I have no resonance with them, they don't linger with me as anything other than strictly academic achievement. With that in mind, if you're interested in checking out a formative piece of film history? This is obviously available on Disney+, making it pretty easy to find and check out. If you're looking for entertainment or a story though, I'd really recommend one of the myriad other Disney animated films that owe thanks to Sleeping Beauty but also surpass it in a number of ways.",

She comes of as almost too flawless which is annoying. The Prince has no personality (or name?) except prancing around being romantic. I never found the dwarfs very entertaining either. I found them mostly annoying and I did as well when I was a child, so I never enjoyed watching this movie even when I was young.The pacing of the movie is also a big problem for me. So much time is spent on walking around, looking at things, investigating at snail-pace.

            "review_title": "Disney's First Animated Film!",
            "content": "Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is more than just a classic. It is a movie, which was released in 1937, that changed the style of filmmaking, particularly within the world of animation. Prior, animation was just seen as a bunch of gags pushed together with talking ducks to keep the kids occupied for several minutes before the main feature. Mr. Disney himself drastically changed that notion. In addition to be the first full-length animated film in color, the film also introduced some very important technical techniques. Even with the hubbub surrounding the historical nature of the film, I feel like it is important to note the film is legitimately a good one. The story is basic and simple, but the characters are well-developed, the songs are great (and would set a standard for future Disney flicks), and the film is still great to look at-especially the sequence involving Snow White's dash to the forest, which still manages to freak me out (something modern horror films often fail to do).The film entered development in 1934. Prior to this project, Disney and his company focused on simple, short features such as the Mickey Mouse series. Then, Disney came up with the idea to create the first animated feature-length flick. There was lots of pushback including from his brother and business partner, Roy Disney. During pre-production and all the way until the film's release, the unfortunate nickname was \"Disney's Folly.\" The budget exceeded a million dollars, which was an incredible amount of money for the time. Disney even had to put down a mortgage on his house to help pay for the costs. I bet those people wish they could take back the negative comments now.During production, a new technique or illusion if you will called \"the multiplane camera\" was invented which is the process of placing several layers of drawings and moving each layer at a different speed, which gives off the illumination that the background is moving. It gave the animation process a sense of realism and was used until computers came along. Also, the creative team, which used cels to create their cartoons, needed larger cels to fit Disney's vision. Of course, this would add to the basic footprint for future animation films.The story itself is based off the fairytales written by the Grimm Brothers. A very simple story in which Disney did not want to just focus on Snow White, but mainly the background and gave each character an importance to the story, which is why the dwarves are a huge standout. Of course, you know the names (Doc, Grumpy, etc), and he wanted to detail each dwarf by each of their names, almost like caricatures you see in the newspapers. And one cannot help saying \"ooooohhh\" and \"awwww\" at the very helpful animals. So, in short, the production did a great job with the visualization of the film.As for the story goes, the treacherous and evil queen hires the huntsman to take Snow White deep into the woods and murder her. Why, you may ask? The queen is simply afraid that the beauty of Snow White (voiced by Adriana Caselotti in her only acting role) would surpass hers. Thanks to an act of kindness, the huntsman spares Snow White's life. She stumbles upon the humble abode of the dwarves and makes herself at home. The dwarves are surprised by her visit, but they decide to take her in. When the queen gets wind of her being alive, she decides to personally pay Snow White a visit...with a poisoned apple.The music definitely set a high standard for future Disney (or animated films for that matter). Disney's music team created memorable hits such as the lovely \"Heigh-Ho.\" In fact, this is the first time that a soundtrack was ever released with a film. Prior, many studios did not really care about a musical companion for their films. The award-winning songs and their popularity did change some minds!It is easy to see why Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a classic, but its more than a classic. It is a movie that changed the world of animation. It goes from a short, kid-friendly series of shorts to a film behemoth that inspired millions of adults and children. If you like Pixar or modern Disney films, you have Walt Disney to thank. He and his creative team took the world by surprise with this movie's success. At its heart, it is just a beautifully-animated feature with great music, stunning visual sequences that still manages to make the heart jump, and a memorable albeit simple story. The film is not just about Snow White, but it is also about the dwarves, the wretched Queen, and the cuddly animals. The dwarves really stole the show, with Grumpy being the most-developed dwarf (and my favorite). Historical footnotes aside, I recommend the film on sole merits of the film itself.My Grade: A-",

That is definitely the case with Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs, the very first animated feature from the studio led by Walt Disney, and the first feature length animated film as a whole for that matter, which even after all these years, still manages to hold its place as a classic.Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs is, simply put, outstanding. It's outstanding not just from an animated perspective, but from a cinematic perspective as well. Being the first full-length animated feature, it proved that a film didn't have to be live action in order to be a work of art. This film is truly a work of art, it's well written, well produced, and of course, it's beautifully animated. One thing I know that Walt Disney aimed to do with the various animated features that he produced during his lifetime was to prove that animation wasn't just strictly for younger audiences, and this film proves it. In fact, as an adult, I find animated films like this to be even better than I did when I was younger.Where do we begin? Let's start with the content itself. The film basically follows the plot of the classic fairy tale, Snow White is a princess who is targeted by the evil queen, who comes up with a plot to silence her, and will try to do so by whatever means necessary. Eventually, Snow White manages to escape, where she comes meets and befriends Seven Dwarfs, who eventually decide to protect her from the evil queen. But of course, it puts a few spins on the tale, something that would become a staple of nearly every Disney animated feature that came after. Basically, it's the trend is like that of every Disney film that's based on a fairy tale, you know how it will end, but you just need to know how to get there from Point A to Point B. And in between those two points, the results are something to see.Then there's the animation, which is simply beautiful to look at, as it simply flows from one animation to the next with relative ease, to the point that one might forget that this was actually drawn and painted. Then, of course, we have the characters, who are very well written, from the titular character, to the seven dwarfs, down to the evil queen, everyone is written in a way that they are believable and where you want the good parties to succeed and the villain to fail. And did I forget to mention the music? This film features another trend in Disney films, sublime music. Here, we've got some classic tunes, such as \"Whistle While You Work\", then there's the Dwarfs marching tune, \"Heigh-Ho\", and who could forget the wonderful \"Someday My Prince Will Come?\"And for the negative things? I honestly can't think of anything to say about it. To say that Disney struck platinum with his first full-length animated feature is all that needs to be said, and they would end up making many more animated classics in the years to come. And furthermore, it's proof that no matter how one tends to look at it, animation is an art form.Needless to say, this is a monumental achievement that you might consider essential for film education, as it (not to sound repetitive) was the first full-length animated feature film, and it shows that animation can be a work of art, as the film itself is a work of art. To say that the film deserves its reputation as a masterwork is putting it lightly, as it was a gamechanger, not just for animation, but possibly even for cinema as a whole.",

He just stands there and tells the other six Dwarfs what to do. I thought it was interesting and amusing that when Disney made Snow White they left that in there, as a small detail, unnoticeable to someone not paying good attention.

There is something undeniably charming, even if long outdated, about the old 2d animation and simple fairy tale within. Part of what made Disney's first feature length endeavor so successful was, of course, the well thought-out animation. There is such great attention to detail within, between the wonderfully drawn animals and beyond fitting character designs. The backgrounds and establishing shots are completely unanimated drawings, though they do prove drawn well enough to not be all that distracting. The only suffering aspect is therefore the dull faces of Snow White and the Prince. Along with good animation, the voice casting is excellent. Highlighting the characters on this front is La Verne's turn as the evil queen, whose various tones enhance the wickedness of the stepmother beyond just a scary design. The picture additionally has much to offer musically. The score is great all throughout and each song is thoughtfully distanced from one another. Starting off with \"I'm Wishing\" and \"One Song\", it is a rather promising musical. Unfortunately, it is a mixed battle thereafter. \"Heigh Ho\" and \"Some Day My Prince Will Come\" shine, but the other half are only decent at best. Many of the bottom tier songs also receive an overbearing amount of screentime, as the story simultaneously begins to lose focus in favor of these songs. Luckily enough, the movie lacks any complex scheme or twist so the third act can still work after a second act that practically ignores the evil queen on the whole. Both the queen and Snow White are easily understood, one being hateful and the latter joyful. Another important element to the story is then the mild horror associated with the stepmother which heavily contrasts the sweet songs of the princess. Snow White is however a bland character that while enjoying some personality, has no motivation beyond staying alive. The prince goes disappointingly much less explored. More debatable is the controversy surrounding the seven dwarfs that while lovable, do admittedly depict the mythical humans like children that need to be told to wash and want bedtime stories. It is therefore clear how the film could perpetuate offensive stereotypes. Regardless, the characters are very likable. Highlighting the seven are Doc, Grumpy, and Dopey, each having especially quirky and fun personalities. Though, the treatment of Dopey is questionable for the mentally challenged nature he is assigned. This makes you think twice about laughing along to the fact that he cannot or has never tried talking, among a few other jokes throughout. Either way, the film is brought ever so slightly down by its insensitivities. Ultimately, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs stands up to the test of time, proving to be worth the watch.",

I mean, judging 76-year-old cartoon characters on the basis of hotness is kinda creepy, but I'll risk creep accusations. The Queen is a babe. Too bad she's a murderous psycho who's obsessed with winning a beauty contest. It's like she's trying to one-up her mirror. \"I'll show you who's more subjectively beautiful, you glass devil!\" We're all a little vain sometimes, but don't you have a kingdom to run, lady?Not that the dwarfs are above reproach either. They're sitting on a fortune in gems and they aren't even spending any of it to improve their lot in life...or the lot of those less fortunate than them. Plus, they tend to wallow in filth. Geez, what a motley cast of characters. Snow White is one of the shallowest movie characters in history, but she should have just bailed on ALL these weirdos. Take the hardworking woodland creatures and split for Oz or Neverland or Belize.But I do love this movie. Irrationally, really. It's the dwarfs! Dopey is the cutest nitwit of all time and Grumpy is pretty much always right. Snow White DOES bring them misery and they would've been saved a lot of heartache if they'd just kicked her out. Still, it's sweet that even Grumpy relents. How can you not relent and fall for this gorgeous little trifle of a movie? The American Film Institute sure did, putting Snow & The 7 on five of its Best Of compilations, including both of the \"100 Years, 100 Movies\" lists.So, yes, the Queen is evil and everyone else in this movie is absurdly pure at heart, but I still think I'd like to live under the Queen's reign. Apparently she spends most of her time gossiping with a mirror and not, you know, doing her job. You could get away with murder, maybe even step-daughtericide! The Queen herself almost does.If you dug this snapshot review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the \"Podcasts\" section for our 31-minute Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs 'cast...and many others.

The colours are beautiful, and there are some charming ideas (the cuckoo's clock that contains a frog, for example). But still: the film is far from perfect, even by the standards of the 1930s. The plot is more than thin and drags in many places (for example, the dwarfs take ages to discover Snow White sleeping). Moreover, Disney needlessly cutified it: Snow White is not supposed to clean and tidy the house (let alone with the help of assorted animals), but rather to eat and drink of the food left by the dwarfs and to leave the room in a mess. But of course, a woman's role was cleaning, if not in the Grimms' early 19th-century Germany, then in the mind of Walt Disney. And finally: I simply dislike Disney's style of drawing. I dislike it intensely. That is of course no more than a personal antipathy, and I realise that someone brought up on this kind of material probably feels differently. Still, I could not watch the film with more than a kind of detached interest. On balance, 6 stars feels about right.",

It's a feel good movie that I remember well from my own childhood, but now in my old days I have some critiques. It's a good adventure, but it evolves as more like a musical, a type of genre that I normally greatly dislike. A few songs could have been skipped, and the choreography in the dancing scenes are too \"nice\". However, this fairytale from the brothers Grimm that I read as a child, was very exiting, and done good on the big screen. It has great animation with good colours and a marvelous depth in the frames. And the dwarfs are fantastic characters; all seven from Grumpy to Dopey.Yes, this movie was ground-breaking when it hit the silver screen, and I think all animated features from Disney is very good - well,up to the end of the 70s.

            "content": "\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" is one of the most important films of all time. As the first ever full-length animated feature, Walt Disney was continuously mocked by the press for risking the future of his studio on such an experimental project. Luckily for Walt, \"Snow White\" shines as a marvel of animation, and is still a heartfelt viewing experience over eighty years after its release.Snow White (Adriana Caselotti) is a scullery maid and the step-daughter to the evil and vile Queen (Lucille La Verne). The Queen is told by her Magic Mirror (Moroni Olsen) that Snow White is \"the fairest of them all\", which prompts the Queen into getting a huntsman (Stuart Buchanan) to kill her. Snow White flees and finds solace in the home of seven dwarfs who mine gemstones.It's a pretty simple story. The movie is only 83 minutes long, and much of that run time is merely music and dancing characters. While it lacks much substance, it is the style and beauty of the animation seamlessly blending with sound effects and music that make this little movie such a treat. The dwarfs and the forest animals are also cute and funny as more comedic characters. Particular favorites of mine are Dopey and the tortoise.Overall this comes as an absolute recommendation for anyone who is in love with animated film and fairy tales. Although the Disney formula and the art of animation would both improve and be refined in later works, this is an essential jumping off point for anyone who wants to get into these movies.",

The songs \"Whistle While You Work\" and \"Heigh-Ho\" are particularly memorable and have become beloved staples of the Disney canon.The characters in \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" are also noteworthy. Snow White herself is a charming and innocent heroine, while the seven dwarfs - Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Dopey, and Sneezy - are lovable and memorable. Their individual personalities and quirks add humor and heart to the film and make them stand out as some of the most memorable Disney characters of all time.Overall, \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" is a must-see for anyone who loves Disney films or classic animation.

            "content": "Yeah, this is a weird setup, but it's pure unalloyed fairy tale par excellence. It's not meant to be taken seriously.Snow White is a cheerful and innocent girl who can talk to animals and convince them to do chores for her. Her stepmother hates her guts because she has a magical mirror that says Snow White is more attractive than her, so she puts a hit on her head. The guy who's supposed to make her sleep with the fishes can't do it and tells her to shove off and never return.Well, she runs into the forest and meets 7 dwarves who work in the mines and the dwarves grow to appreciate having a feminine presence around the house.This is a visual feast. Not only is it superbly animated, but most of the characters, particularly the dwarves, are very expressive (in fact most are named after their most salient characteristic).Oddly the three main human characters' faces are ill-defined. Perhaps that was on purpose as they just represent archetypes? (Snow White representing ebullient feminine youth, the queen representing female jealous a la Hera, the prince just a deus ex machina). Nevertheless, it doesn't extend to every human. The scene with the hunter unable to deal the coup de grace is superbly dramatic and the queen's face comes alive with giddy wickedness as the old hag.As for the backgrounds and settings, they're full of grand scenes you won't soon forget. The dungeon scene and the final confrontation on the cliff might just stay with you permanently.The plot is pure fluff but this movie isn't about plot. It's about recapturing the wonder of traditional European fairy tales, which themselves are only rough outlines of the most primal of human archetypes and the barest of universal human scenarios.It's a brick house. Built to last.Honourable Mentions: Game of Thrones (2011). Peter Dinklage brings the character of Tyrion Lannister to life. Without a doubt the most serious and nuanced representation of a dwarf character I have seen in a work of fiction.",

            "content": "Well, here is the film that started an empire. Not only was it Walt Disney's first foray into feature length animated films, it was also the first full length cell animated film ever attempted. I suppose it's needless to say that the gamble paid off for him. Especially when you take into account the fact that Disney, after just buying 20th Century Fox entertainment, now technically owns about a third of the entertainment industry.Walt Disney first came across the tale of Snow White when he was about fifteen years of age after reading The Brothers Grimm tale of the same name. He later stated that he couldn't get the story out of his head and he would be constantly playing the story over in his mind. After the success of his Mickey Mouse and the Silly Symphonies series, Walt pooled everyone together and started work on Snow White in early 1934. The film was finally released in December 1937, and received a standing ovation from an audience containing that of Judy Garland. Snow White went on to do exceptionally well at the box office, and in 1939 became the top grossing sound film of all-time.Snow White at the start of the tale has been forced into the life of a scullery maid. This is being enforced by her incredibly jealous and equally vain stepmother, the Queen. This obstinately vain monarch is particularly fixated with being the fairest in the land and believes her beautiful stepdaughter, Snow White, to be a growing threat to her. Her worst fears are realised when the Queens magic mirror declares Snow White to be the fairest in the land. Overcome with jealousy, the Queen hires a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. The huntsman however is struck by Snow White's innocence and beauty, and tells her to flee into the forest in order to escape the Queens wrath. There she bumps into a company of dwarves, all with distinctive personalities and loveable quirks. The dwarves allow her to stay after learning she's on the run and especially after learning that she can cook and clean (I don't think sexism was a big thing in the 1930's unfortunately). Meanwhile, the Queen is hatching more maniacal schemes to find and kill Snow White. Snow White as a lead serves her purpose well enough. These days however she pales in comparison with Disney's latest and more stronger and self-sufficient movie heroines, such as: Moana and Frozen's Anna and Elsa. Since Snow White's only noticeable qualities is her uncommonly kind nature, naivety, and Betty Boop esc singing voice (which is also a little dated). She tends to come off a bit bland, but fortunately the dwarves more than make up for the leads short comings, and outright steal the show. The dwarves themselves all have different personalities, which are reflected in their names, in their timeless designs and exquisitely differing animations. The stand out has to be Dopey, his animation and musical cues made me chuckle a good few times. The dwarves serve as the charm and heart of the film, of which I am sure, has played a big part in this films continued success amongst children even today. I've heard a few people say in their reviews that they didn't think the Queen was a very effective villain. I can understand that point of view, especially since some of her schemes are not the cleverest. However when I watched the film as a kid I found the Queen to be absolutely terrifying, especially when she disguises herself as the old crone. I am pretty sure that I had nightmares over that old crone, and that for me has to show a definite level of effectiveness to a villain. The first thing for me that stands out is the terrific design. She looks menacing and intimidating as the queen, with her tall slender frame and pointed features. While her truly frightening design, as the old crone, allows the character to reveal her evil and deceitful ways. There is one character who gets cast aside and receives basically no development at all, and that would be the prince. He shows up a bit at the beginning and then again for the finale at the end. The problem with this is they have no interaction with each other in-between these events. This makes the relationship between the two characters very unbelievable by modern standards. Perhaps if he was given some more scenes to expand his personality a bit, or maybe even a name, his appearance at the end would not have been so jarring. The musical numbers for the most part are brilliant and truly timeless; such as \"Heigh-Ho\". This particular tune is extremely hard to get out of your head once it's ingrained itself in there. However the \"I'm Wishing / One Song\" and most others sung by Snow White herself have a tendency to sound a little dated, and as I mentioned before, a bit Betty Boop like. When I re-watched the film for this review, I couldn't help but be amazed by the extraordinarily lifelike animation that Disney and his incredible animation team had achieved. I hadn't watched the movie for a very long time and for some reason expected the animation to be, not bad, but dated compared to the more recent animated movies. Boy was I wrong. Eighty years on and it still looks practically flawless. There's nothing better than watching true masters of their craft and Disney's animators are in top form here.Apart from occasionally showing its age and having some key characters shockingly underdeveloped. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is an enduring classic that will most likely be passed down for generations to come. If you're looking to entertain your nostalgic side a bit. Or perhaps looking into the origins of modern day animation and cinema, or maybe even trying to entertain your children for a couple of hours, there is not many finer options out there than this Disney classic.",

She honestly sounds like she's on drugs or something; sing-songy, vapid, weird inflections, really off-putting. The dwarves dialog and voices aren't as bad, although a lot of it is also silly.

It may not quite have been the world's first animated feature, but was without doubt the genesis of the modern animation industry.The film holds up remarkably well on a technical level. Multiplane shots are not as smooth as we are used to nowadays, but the backgrounds and characters are still as vibrant and enchanting as ever.Rather than technical details, the biggest drawback to \"Snow White\" is its lack of narrative substance. A very literal adaptation of the classic Grimm fairy tale, the story is limited to basic interpersonal conflict: queen tries to kill girl, girl is saved by prince. In later films like \"Pinocchio\" and \"Cinderella\", the leads were blessed with personality -- flaws, an arc -- which made their stories relatable. Snow White and her prince are just two pretty faces moving as the stories requires them to. The simplicity is charming in a way, but not cathartic.But is it fair to be harsh on such a pioneering effort? Seeing how Disney produced two of the greatest masterpieces of animation immediately afterwards, I'd say it is.

She helped clean up the mess the dwarves made in their cottage house. She did become a homeless woman after the huntsman sent her running away from home.I liked the 7 dwarves Doc, Bashful, Sleepy, Sneezy, Happy. But I liked Dopey the funny man and I liked Grumpy as I relate to him. The 7 dwarves were nice enough to provide Snow White shelter since she became homeless. I also liked the dance party and they fought the Evil Queen and won.I did like the Huntsman as he stood up to the queen and spared Snow Whites life and tricked the Queen.The Prince Charming character I didn't know much about as the Disney animators didn't give him enough screen time, I would've like to know more about his life. But thankfully he saved Snow White's life with a kiss and they both got hitched and possibly married in the castle.I didn't like the Stepmother Queen at all as she was a serial killer and a murderer in her heart. She ended up growing old like a creepy old beggar woman and tried to kill her stepdaughter with a poisoned apple. Thankfully she came to her untimely death falling off a cliff.I also didn't like the Magic Mirror masked man who deceived the queen and told her lies about her and Snow White her stepdaughter. I wish her stepmother would've broke the mirror and change her evil murderous ways.Overall this is a fairy tale movie but there's some PG-13 content stuff involved in this movie. But it's a very good movie to watch and I highly recommend watching this movie, it is a slow movie but still worth watching.For the rating of this movie I would rate it PG-13 for scary scenes, peril, brief violence.",

It certainly set a standard.I'll outline the plot for you, although it is common knowledge... an innocent young girl with an evil, jealous stepmother (who incidentally wants to kill her) finds refuge with 7 little dwarfs after a series of events. It is a classic fairytale story where the girl is completely stupid and useless, unable to fight for herself. But anyway.This movie made an impression on me and was one of the first scary movies I watched. In all honesty I do not think this is really appropriate for children as I was really frightened and disturbed by it when I was two or three. Now I'm a teenager and I still cannot bring myself to watch it. A great piece of movie history... but don't make me watch it.",

            "content": "Walt Disney was only 14 when he saw \"Snow White\" for the first time. The year was 1915, and the black-and-white silent movie made a profound impression on him. So Disney took a correspondence course in cartooning. A few years later he moved to Los Angeles: the city at the center of the animation industry. It was here that the first official Walt Disney Studio was established in the early 1930s.The story in \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" originated in Europe during the Middle Ages. It tells the tale of a wicked Queen who tries to kill her beautiful stepdaughter. Fortunately, the girl manages to escape into the forest, where she seeks refuge with seven dwarfs in a small cabin. But the evil Queen doesn't give up that easily...In the mid '30s Walt Disney ran the most successful animation studio in Hollywood. With \"Steamboat Willie\" he had made the world's first talking cartoon, and with \"Flowers and Trees\" the first one in color. Now Disney aspired to try something new. He wanted to make a full-length animated movie. And he had an old favorite in mind. Walt Disney Studios was to film \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\".It turned out to be a shockingly complicated venture. The costs soon broke all calculations, and Disney had to mortgage his beloved home to be able to pay the large staff of cartoonists. When, after three years of hard work, they were finally finished, the project was widely known as \"Disney's Folly\" in Hollywood. No one thought the film would ever be able to recoup the money Walt Disney had put into it.Luckily, they were all wrong. The movie became a global sensation. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until \"Gone with the Wind\" displaced it in 1939. \"Snow White\" was also the first movie to release a soundtrack album. At the Academy Awards that year Disney was given one normal-sized, and seven miniature Oscar statuettes.",

Little Diane cried uncontrollably but instead of Walt turning off the film and taking care of his daughter, he asked a Disney employee to take the girl outside so his employees could see the end of the film. So what did we get? A film that is more for adults than for children Thus proving that animated films are really for adults than children.I ask myself why then is Disney's current film is just kiddie fare.",

I've also been forced to watch recent Disney fare like Frozen in recent times and can remember my feeling about them. It is years since I've watched Snow White.What a difference!This is an actual, proper attempt at a meaningful film, not some marketing or pandering exercise with paper thin intent, tiresome & predictable design & characters, and an OD of sugar or saccharine. Very refreshing.It feels far more like the masterpieces of animation that are still possible in Japan and were possible with Pixar but which Disney's shallowness has made impossible from them in decades.The quality of animation of figures has a naturalistic movement that is simply so far ahead of current Disney it isn't funny. And the backgrounds. Even with modern day computing power recent stuff is weak, while the second half of the 20th century stuff is just plain cheap and childish in comparison.There is also actual atmosphere. The noirish shadows, the angles, there is genuine foreboding.Pus it thankfully, so very thankfully, doesn't suffer from the pregnant pause face shots and poses that plague ends of scenes of so many of today's productions, animated or live action. If anything the transitions move a couple of seconds too quickly. But I'd still far rather have this older style of film making than the soapish current vogue.The music is also wonderful. I don't know whether they work because I've heard them all my life or because they are actually good. But they do.So, after all that, why not a 10? For 2 reasons.1) Snow White herself. She is so matronising and privileged. Not a pleasant characterisation. The singing voice is also rather twee.\n2) The denouement simply isn't believable.If this film was made today like this I'd probably mark it 8, but given when it was made it deserves more, so a 9.Wonderful.",

Snow White wasn't really made as a kid's movie it was made as a family movie perhaps, but was definitely aimed at a more adult audience (and parts of it are scary for kids) with the peculiarity that it is animated. When you watch Snow White you are watching an art that was almost better in it's infancy that in it's so called adult hood, now there are few hand animators left and instead of sweating over a flip board they are hitting buttons on a computer...and it's missing something somehow.

The animation and visuals are way ahead of their time. I'm still trying to figure out how they achieved certain scenes. The most astonishing aspect of the visuals is the use of shadows. It's a Technicolor masterpiece that should be enjoyed by children and adults alike. Although I must admit, some parts of the film are dated, notably the dialogue and the storytelling and the fact that Snow White is a stereotypical housewife. She cleans the house, cooks dinner, makes pies, and is not very bright. Nevertheless, she kicked off the Disney Princess trend as well as the animated film trend. Few films have captured the imagination of millions quite like Snow White. Because of that, I'm giving her and her seven little dwarfs an 8/10 RATING.",

I just hate Snow White. From her tacky primary colored dress to her stupid sounding voice and naive actions, this is one character who will forever annoy me with her ignorance.The only reason I give this a three is because I like the dwarfs in the movie. That's it. Other than that it's a completely idiotic film that will waste years away collecting dust on your shelf when you realize how crappy it is yourself.",

While the complexity that is in today's family movies isn't present in this film, and some of its themes may be seen as problematic today, I still think this is a lovely story about vanity, greed and the power of kindness. Visually, it has to be one of my favourite Disney films... It's just incredible. The illustrations of the deer and birds and rabbits has me in a choke-hold. I wish Disney was still creating illustrated movies of this aesthetic.",

            "content": "Walt Disney's \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" succeeded even though Snow White herself is a bland character who primarily serves to inspire all of the fun side characters. She could be more expressive and funny, and other than being happy and cheerful doesn't offer a ton as a character in terms of personality or character development. The prince, suitably named The Prince, gets the same amount of background and character growth as thought that went into his name; none. At least Cinderella got Prince Charming. The Prince only shows up a few times in the movie and doesn't speak once. On top of that, Disney hardly follows the source material from the Brothers Grimm. This film was also very experimental, being Disney's first feature-length animated film and the first ever full-length animated feature in color. These aspects should have spelled disaster for this movie, but Disney knew what he was doing.\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" is as much fun as it is because Disney made sure to build the world of \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" without worrying too much about the story. Of course, the story is a classic fairy tale with a jealous evil witch, a prince and princess, and danger to overcome. Still, the fun side characters and cute animals make this film a classic and not just a historical milestone for animation. All the dwarfs aren't just given their personalities with their names but express them exaggeratedly and charmingly. When things get scary or tense for Snow White, the cute forest animals help her and provide relief for the kids watching. This movie moves briskly and doesn't waste any of its 83-minute run time, filling every frame with detail and moving swiftly from one classic song to another (\"Heigh-Ho\").Some of that detail was realized due to Disney's innovation of the \"multiplane camera,\" simulating depth in animated films by having multiple drawings at different levels and moving them at different speeds and directions. This technique would be used for animated films for the next 60 years before computer animation took over. While \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" may feel clich\u00e9 upon viewing in 2022, this all-time classic is what helped create most of the fairy tale movie tropes and clich\u00e9s we've come to know, and the impact Disney made on the animation industry with this film in 1937 will be felt forever. 7.5/10.",

            "content": "I enjoyed watching this movie as a kid and it looked awesome! When I watched it with a friend, it just sounds so cheesy and predictable. It's the first animated movie ever so I give them credit for it's creation and dedication. It won't be all adventurous and complex like Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, but it's simple and lighthearted (a good path for Disney's first movie).I got to be honest with you, but I can't stand Snow White! Her voice is do pitchy and annoying. She's so naive and sweet ugh! If I want a princess being my role model; I would turn to Belle for a Disney princess. I just don't like her. The Evil Queen is a lot prettier than Snow White. The Queen is one of my favorite Disney villains alone with Scar and Ursula. The Queen may have awful plans to become a hag (she should have turn Snow White into a hag instead of herself), but she's a ruthless and cold person in and out. She's arguably the best character that this movie has to offer. Second place are the woodland animals and third is the boulder.The animation looks really good, even from 1937. I really like the colors that the animators used and it looks nicely done. No CGI was used to animate this movie so don't expect Snow White to look like Rapunzek or Princess Fiona from Shrek (her ogre form is prettier than Snow White is). And the scene with the Queen's transformation is nicely done- if this was done by hand, why can't animators these days draw backdrops and things and such? As you read my reviews, I'm not a fan of CGI except Tangled and a few other films.Snow White may not be Disney's best work, but it is the first animated film ever created. Watch it when your kids are young and discard it when you are older.",

What was he doing there?), then the woodcutter goes looking for Snow White and tries to kill him but he can't and asks him to run away because the queen wants to kill him , listening char eso Snow White flees with all her might until she hallucinate that everything around her wants to attack her (So far it seems crazy to me how Disney made that scene by giving it a macabre touch, like the desperation of the character itself) seeing that it was an illusion of her head comes across the house of the dwarfs, she knocks on the door and seeing no one decides to go in, she starts to clean with her singing animals (I love that scene how the soundtrack goes to the rhythm of the animation and that everything looks like a party at cleaning time), Snow White feels tired and decides to go to sleep, some time passes and the dwarfs at work begin to sing the iconic song. Seeing that it was lunch time they decide to leave, when they get home they find everything clean changed and with the food cooking, they decide to go investigate and send the funny tontin (my favorite character, so innocent and charismatic) they get scared and decide running when Snow White wakes up they see that she is a very beautiful woman, they talk to her and decide that she stays. The next day they tell her before leaving that she be careful with the queen that she can disguise herself as any object or person. Snow White is left alone; the queen prepares something evil and decides to go looking for her disguised as an old woman, she goes and meets her and gives her the poisoned apple, Snow White falls asleep, the dwarfs arrive and follow her until she falls off the cliff and dies, Snow White is put in a coffin and is adored by the dwarfs until her prince charming comes and wakes her up with a kiss, and they live happily ever after.Conclusion: A spectacular movie from start to finish, I really don't get bored of watching it, and how can I not forget the dwarfs who give the film a bit of humor, every time I saw the dwarfs I felt like I was transported to cartoons like Looney Tunes or Tom and Jerry, it has a little bit of everything. The queen as a spectacular villain despite the fact that she appears in few scenes, she still receives praise as a villain. I love animation and music, I admired how Disney, despite being his first film, did it too well. Excellent.",

            "content": "The first full length animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is certainly a masterpiece. The animation is stunning, the music is timeless, and so on. To be honest, each scene is more heartwarming and cozy than the last. Besides the first and last five minutes of the movie, nothing bad really ever happens to the main characters. That's a refreshing change. If I have any gripes with the movie, it's that dumb Prince Charming guy. We first see him when he creepily sneaks up to Snow White and startles her. Snow White obviously flees, and Prince Charming has the nerve to be surprised. What a dope. Snow White then fantasizes about him for the rest of the movie (for some reason) until he shows up again at the very end. Somehow, he's even stupider by then. He kisses Snow White's corpse on the lips. A few things are wrong with this. First of all, I'm pretty sure that's illegal, for a number of reasons. Secondly, corpse germs are a real thing. Once Snow awakens, she runs off with him into the wilderness. I'm pretty sure he kills her, because we never hear from Snow White again. There's not even a bad Disney sequel about her. Now you might be wondering, why does Snow like this guy in the first place? Well, apparently she's only fourteen, so I guess it's just her teen hormones tricking her mind. Also, apparently there were supposed to be a bunch more scenes of Prince Charming in the middle parts of the movie that just didn't make the cut. I guess Walt realized that the Prince is such a simple transparent character that we didn't need any more scenes to explain his motivations. Anyway, besides it's little kinks, the movie does hold up incredibly well in the 21st century, especially considering it was made in the freaking 30's. The (mostly) lovable characters, along with the brilliant talents behind the scenes, make Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs one of the greatest Disney, nay, one of the greatest FILMS of all time. It's certainly the most watchable 30's film by today's standards. P.S. Doc is definitely the best dwarf!",

Up until then, animation was usually only regulated to just being a little five minute short you saw before the actual movie started. But this showed that animation was capable of so much more. If it weren't for this, all of the animated movies that we love would have never existed. And how well does this incredibly influential piece of entertainment hold up over 80 years later?It's not bad.Okay, I'd imagine that when this first came out, people must have been blown away by it. Then again, they didn't really have anything to compare it to. But today? Animated movies are now starting to rival live-action films. In my personal opinion, a lot of them even surpass live-action films. So when I see an hour-and-23 minute movie whose story could have been told in 30 minutes or less, don't expect me to compare it to something like \"Wall-E\" or \"Soul\" Yes, the story has quite a bit of filler and some of the scenes are pretty forgettable. Not only that, but a lot of the songs aren't exactly the best. Some of them are good, but others you won't remember for very long. A few days after watching it, you'll be able to remember maybe a few key scenes, but about 70-75% of the movie you'll forget about.(Side-Tangent: Did anyone else notice how much of a creep the Prince was? Like, he broke into a woman's house, a woman whom he doesn't even know, and then at the end of the movie, he goes out to find her and then kisses her while she was under the effect's of the evil step-mother's spell. He did not know about that spell, so as far as he knew, he was making out with a corpse. Tangent over.)Alright, now onto the good stuff, which there is plenty of. The first thing that jumped out to me was the animation style. All of the human characters are animated in this very unique way. It's as if they drew over a real-life actor doing the motions (if you saw the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about). In fact, I think that is how they animated it. It give the movie such a unique look that's unlike anything else today. It almost makes me wish that there was a whole movie animated just like that. Of course, all of the things that are animated normally still look great. I mean, it's Disney animation, it's kind of a given that it's going to look amazing and push boundaries. Now, I know that before that I said a few of the songs weren't amazing, but the songs that are good are pretty catchy. Something else this movie does really well is the writing. This goes for a lot of the movies during this early era of Disney, but this movie isn't really written like a movie. It written almost like a storybook or a fairytale, which is pretty fitting, I suppose.All of these factors combined make \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" a unique experience unlike anything else made today, for better and for worse. So, should you watch this piece of Disney history? Sure. I mean, it's \"Snow White\" it's a classic. But just know that it's status and importance doesn't automatically mean you're going to enjoy it.",

            "content": "Yes, \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" was the first full-length animated feature and yes, it does look tecnically beautiful, but I feel that it isn't the best Disney film (that honer goes to \"sleeping Beauty\"). There are reasons why I don't like it a lot (Spoilers might be coming).First off, the queen (voiced by Lucille LaVerne) is one scary villian. Scary enough to even scare the s*** off a grown-up. The queen's transformation is still one of the scariest scenes I have ever seen in a animated film. When the queen is around, the movie turns into a dark fantasy and it overshadows the child-like elements of the film.But the scene I hated the most was the \"Heigh-Ho\" sequence. For me, the scene just didn't do it for me. It is a scene that seems more like it overplays itself. This scene could have been two other things. We could have just heard them talking or they could have gotten rid of the scene altogether and used the deleted \"Music In Your Soup\" number. For almost eleven years, I was scared of this scene until I saw \"Gremlins\" recently where they used this scene. I wasn't afraid anymore, but I was unmoved by the scene.But I did say it was great at times and it is. This is mainly evident in the film's conclusion. It's conclusion is well thought out and in the end, it pays off big time and it shows. I wasn't even disturbed by the title-card narration. I actully thought it was quite inventive , but the title-card narration was actully animated and it was not used for almost the same reason the \"Music In Your Soup\" sequence was deleted. Due to time. Walt Disney himself said in 1955 on his television show that it was cut due to this very reasonThere was only one scary sequence I liked and it was when Snow White went in to the forest. Another good sequence involves the dwarfs washing up. It is very funny and interesting. The climatic chase sequence between the Queen and the dwarfs is easily the film's best scene and the scene where the queen poisons Snow White with the apple is made great by its trick photography.In the end, I have mixed feelings about the film. Some scenes are great while others fall flat on their face (like the \"Heigh-Ho\" sequence), but under its many flaws, it is still a very good film, but its not the greatest of them all. I might be 15 years old, but I like the film anyway.But it still gets a good rating from me *** out of ***** or 6/10",

The way water moves in the movie looks great. The character movement is smooth and looks great. It's just a very beautiful movie. Story wise it didn't really do much for me. The plot of the movie sees Snow White a pretty basic character moving into a house in the woods with the Dawfs. This is largely just used to set up some fun slice of life moments with Snow and the Dawfs which are fun to watch but nothing incredible. The queen villain was a fun character to watch as well despite being pretty basic but other than her I found the end of the movie very dull. It probably doesn't help that this is one of the most well known endings to a film so it's not like I didn't know what to expect but it's somehow more boring than I thought. The prince who rescues Snow White is barley present in the movie except when he kisses her at the end and he is shown briefly at the start. But he does nothing the entire movie. I genuinely don't remember if he is even named in the movie. He is such an incredibly dull character and the movie would have lost nothing without him. So it's baffling to see him be that important to the ending. Overall the movie is a fun watch for the animation and slice of life bits. But has little to offer outside of that. It's obviously historically significant but I still wouldn't call it a must watch.",

The worst part of this film is that the story takes painfully long to progress and this personality gives me a immense headache, to the point where I consider turning of the film.

            "content": "\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" is at the same time the first Disney animated feature and the first feature-length animated film of all time. Without it, who knows of we'd ever get animation as we know it today, since these things were unimaginable back then. And that alone makes it worthy of some mad respect! And the fact that it holds up so well to this day only furthers that point.Now, I like 3D animation, but I prefer the old-school, 2D animation style. And this really looks gorgeous, especially considering the time it was made. There's not as much work put into backgrounds compared to some later Disney films, but the backgrounds still look like paintings anyway. The movements look pretty nice too, except for the prince looking a bit odd, but supposedly he was really hard to animate. The characters themselves are pretty likeable too. Some might find Snow White annoying because of her high-pitched voice, but I think she's adorable. This Snow White is THE Snow White, as she will probably be the first to come to mind when you mention the character. And while there might be seven of the dwarfs, not one of them feels pushed aside and each one manages to have his own distinct personality in less than 90 minutes, which is kind of an amazing achievement when you think about it. One (Grumpy) even has a character arc which actually enhances the emotion largely in some scenes near the end, I'd go as far to say that he's the overlooked emotional drive of the third act, just not put into focus of the situation. Let's take a look at the human characters now. Snow White is a Mary Sue, there's no denying that. But this was the first Disney princess, I think we can forgive that. Same goes for The Prince, but he's actually barely in the movie, so does it really matter? The Evil Queen is such an iconic villain in both of her forms throughout the movie and sets a high bar for Disney villains yet to come, a bar that still managed to be surpassed. The Huntsman has something unique to him as well, but he's not much in the movie either. There is, however, one side character that I found very mysterious and intriguing: The Magic Mirror. It's creepy, has an incredible design and oozes with mystery. The story is pretty thin and slowed down by random scenes that feel like filler, but hey, they are a fun filler that helps develops the personalities of each of the dwarves. And keep in my mind that Disney was starting out with storytelling, so it needed some time to improve. However, this movie isn't so much about what is done, it's about how it's done. And don't even get me started on the ending, which I consider among the greatest of all time. With barely any talking at all, it mostly relies on the technical aspects. Haunting music leading to a triumph and heavenly imagery that makes the eyes pop out, it's a thing to behold and might even tear you up a bit if you're a nostalgia freak.While it's not a perfect movie and it has its flaws, its charm and the fact that it's a cinematic milestone makes it more than deserving of a 10.",

Sure it isn't the same as animation is now, but let's face it, most animation nowadays isn't very good. I can name a plethora of reasons why I love this movie. The animation is beautiful, with one or two stiff movements, but have a heart, it is the first Disney animation. The songs are mind-blowing, as well as the gorgeous incidental music(music similar to Great Expectations, 1946) that hardly anybody has mentioned. My favourite is \"Someday my Prince Will Come\", I cry every time I hear it. The characters are legendary, and the writing is top notch. Who can forget those adorable dwarfs, who added such a lot to this movie. Snow White is the weakest character but I like her innocence very much, and about her singing voice...it sounds weak, but in real life it must have been strong, and let me explain why. The colouratura soprano Amelita Galli-Curci was given the praise \"a beautiful and limpid voice\" yet I heard it on cassette and it sounds quite quiet. It has nothing to do with the size of the voice, but the quality of the recording. The best character was the wicked queen, who had the most classic animation scene I have ever seen... when she turns into a hag, which freaked me out big time when I was about 9, like Malificent from \"Sleeping Beauty.\" To me the Queen is probably one of the scariest Disney villains ever. The scene at Snow White's coffin was heart-rending, and it was the music that made it so. All in all, a beautiful, funny and touching movie, and I can't believe some people hated this. 10/10.

Disney's Folly,A Movie MilestoneWhere would the animation world be without the humongous success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs? If the movie failed back in 1937, there would be no Disney Company today, no Lion King, and no Disneyland. Disney's Folly, as critics first called it, would probably have scared any other industry from attempting such an ambitious and innovative project. Pixar may not have ever had the chance to put out their groundbreaking features, and even the Disney- and fairy tale-bashing Shrek may never have been made if Snow White didn't set the course for the world of the animated feature.There must have been tremendous pressure on everyone involved in the making of Snow White, but they did not disappoint. The end result includes a timeless story, classic songs, and beautiful imagery that will live on for future generations to enjoy. In fact, this was only the second movie that captured my nieces' full attention spans (The Lion King being the first).In my opinion, the story was great but not perfect. It's not as exciting or filled with as much witty remarks as today's animated features, but as soon as the dwarfs are introduced, the movie takes on an endearing lighter side. For the record, my favorite dwarf is Doc, because I can relate to him being a strong leader with some very humanistic follies, such as always getting tongue-tied (I do that myself all too often). All the songs stand out in their own way. `Some Day My Prince Will Come' is a classic, fairy-tale ballad. `Heigh-Ho,' `Dig, Dig, Dig,' and `Whistle While You Work' are great songs to pick up your spirits when you have to go to work, do chores, or do homework. And my favorite, `The Silly Song,' is just a great, catchy, and funny song. As for the imagery, it's just breathtaking, especially considering how early it was introduced. The colors are rich and lively, and the multi-plane camera does add some great depth to the movie.As you can tell, for an animation and Disney fan like myself, Snow White is a perfect milestone in the movie world. Even compared to the animation and storytelling styles of today, Snow White still stands the test of time. Kudos to everyone involved in this picture as their work will live on forever.My IMDb Rating: 10/10. My Yahoo! Grade: A+ (Oscar-Worthy)",

This is one of those few movies where I honestly don't find anything truly wrong. It tells a simple and easy to follow story and it does it perfectly. The characters have clear personality and motivations. The lead, Snow White must be one of the best Disney protagonists. She is a very simple character, but there's anything wrong with simplicity. She is one of the most wholesome characters I've seen in an animated movie, like, my God, she deserves heaven. The movie, just like Pinocchio a few years later, shows perfectly the naiveness of a child and how sometimes being too kind to others can lead to bad results (She's supposed to be 14 but she looks older, probably because of the actress that served as a model).  Again, it's a simple story, but it works wonderfully. After all, this was from a simpler time in movie history. The songs are beautiful. The emotional moments hit really hard in the feels (I wanted to cry with the ending, so beautiful). This is pretty much a flawless movie. Not the best Disney movie, but what a great start for what would become a giant in the animation industry. My only issue is some dialogue, like some of it has not aged well, making some lines come out as sexist, but it's not a real problem, because it's not like the movie is portraying sexist acts as the correct thing or anything.Pretty much a must-see for anyone interested in animation and cinema in general.",

The jealous Queen orders her Huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. She further demands that the huntsman return with Snow White's heart in a jeweled box as proof of the deed. However, the Huntsman cannot bring himself to kill Snow White. He tearfully begs for her forgiveness, revealing the Queen wants her dead and urges her to flee into the woods and never look back. Lost and frightened, the princess is befriended by woodland creatures who lead her to a cottage deep in the woods. Finding seven small chairs in the cottage's dining room, Snow White assumes the cottage is the untidy home of seven orphaned children.In reality, the cottage belongs to seven adult dwarfs\u2014named Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey\u2014who work in a nearby mine. Returning home, they are alarmed to find their cottage clean and suspect that an intruder has invaded their home. The dwarfs find Snow White upstairs, asleep across three of their beds. Snow White awakes to find the dwarfs at her bedside and introduces herself, and all of the dwarfs eventually welcome her into their home after she offers to clean and cook for them. Snow White keeps house for the dwarfs while they mine for jewels during the day, and at night they all sing, play music and dance.Meanwhile, the Queen discovers that Snow White is still alive when the mirror again answers that Snow White is the fairest in the land and reveals that the heart in the jeweled box is actually that of a pig. Using a potion to disguise herself as an old hag, the Queen creates a poisoned apple that will put whoever eats it into the \"Sleeping Death\", a curse she learns can only be broken by \"love's first kiss\", but is certain Snow White will be buried alive. While the Queen goes to the cottage while the dwarfs are away, the animals are wary of her and rush off to find the dwarfs. Faking a potential heart attack, the Queen tricks Snow White into bringing her into the cottage to rest. The Queen fools Snow White into biting into the poisoned apple under the pretense that it is a magic apple that grants wishes. As Snow White falls asleep, the Queen proclaims that she is now the fairest of the land. The dwarfs return with the animals as the Queen leaves the cottage and give chase, trapping her on a cliff. She tries to roll a boulder over them, but before she can do so, lightning strikes the cliff, causing her to fall to her death.The dwarfs return to their cottage and find Snow White seemingly dead, being kept in a deathlike slumber by the poison. Unwilling to bury her out of sight in the ground, they instead place her in a glass coffin trimmed with gold in a clearing in the forest. Together with the woodland creatures, they keep watch over her. A year later, the prince from the beginning of the movie learns of her eternal sleep and visits her coffin. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, which breaks the spell and awakens her. The dwarfs and animals all rejoice as the Prince takes Snow White to his castle.",
