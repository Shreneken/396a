That he did so, winning the 1938 Best Picture Oscar, is immensely to his credit.Hobbling on the crutches that signaled the crippling arthritis that would soon confine him to a wheelchair, Lionel Barrymore is the focal point of the film as the grandfather of a wacky clan that believes in doing whatever makes them happy. So they dance, make fireworks, bake candy, paint, write novels, and construct toys with equal joy - laughing through the Depression with much love & great contentment. Jean Arthur, James Stewart & Edward Arnold co-star, with a mammoth cast of supporting players.This is the movie for viewers who want to feel warm & safe & cuddled & protected.",

            "content": "You Can't Take It With You won for Best Picture of 1938 and got Frank Capra his third Oscar for Best Director. Looking at it now it is firmly anchored in the decade that spawned it and the Oscar is a tribute to authors Kaufman and Hart and their popularity in that time. You Can't Take It With You came off a Broadway run of 838 performances for the 1936-1938 Broadway seasons. It's a tale of two men and their families. Edward Arnold plays Anthony Kirby millionaire banker and industrialist who is obsessed with both making money and his social position, though the latter is more in deference to his snooty wife Mary Forbes. Their son James Stewart is preparing uneasily to step into his father's world. What really is Stewart's main interest is the romance he's got going with the only normal member of that other family, Jean Arthur.Her grandfather is the second man with a family. A very extended family that all lives under one roof because that's how Lionel Barrymore as Grandpa Vanderhof likes it. He's got a daughter who writes unpublished plays, a son-in-law who likes to experiment with fireworks, a granddaughter who aspires to be a ballerina, her husband who is a xylophone virtuoso and an iceman who was so taken with the house he just quit his job and stayed there. I can't really blame Halliwell Hobbes the iceman. If I was being supported by Jean Arthur's salary as a secretary and Lionel Barrymore's investments, I'd quit working myself.In fact I can understand Barrymore's sentiments. I had an opportunity to retire early myself and took it and don't regret it. Of course I'm not supporting a whole extended family either. Let Sanuel S. Hinds, Spring Byington, Ann Miller, and Dub Taylor go out and earn a little and then become bohemians.Both Arnold and Barrymore are extreme in their philosophy and the play and film are weighed heavily in Barrymore's balance. But looking at it objectively, Barrymore has a more realistic outlook for most people. There are a couple of dinner scenes at the Vanderhof house and it looks like quite a feed. Who's paying for it?This was James Stewart's first and Jean Arthur's second film with Frank Capra. Next year they would do their second and last in the much acclaimed Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. In doing the screen adaptation, Capra and screenwriter Robert Riskin created a whole new character in Mr. Poppins played by Donald Meek. Poppins is an inoffensive little bureaucrat who would rather make little toys than add columns of figures all day. One meeting with Lionel Barrymore persuades Donald Meek to follow his dream. He blended so well into the Vanderhof household that Kaufman and Hart praised his creation.Though You Can't Take It With You is dated it is still funny as all get out. And you haven't lived until you've heard Brahm's Hungarian Dance Number 5 done as a xylophone solo.",

            "content": "George Kaufman and Moss Hart, the playwrights of the original play in which this film is based, seemed to have been keenly aware that most people in their pursuit of wealth and success in life basically forget the most important point of all: To live life to its fullest, enjoying every minute of it and sharing with loved ones and friends everything, good, or bad.\"You Can't Take it with You\" is an enormously satisfying theater play, which must have drawn Frank Capra's attention to bring it to the movies. In fact, it meshes well with most of his films, in that this is a film with a social conscience, after all. The screen play by Robert Riskin has some awkward moments, but the finished product proves that Mr. Capra could turn any script into a movie with great success. While this film is not in the same league as his other masterpieces, it is still a good way to spend some time with good company.Much has been said in this forum about the merits of YCTIWY. The cast of this film is Hollywood at its best. Lionel Barrymore makes a great contribution with his Martin Vanderhof, the patriarch of the crazy household where happiness lives. Vanderhof's life is full because of his family and the friends he welcomes to share whatever he has, asking nothing in return. He is a rich man, indeed.By contrast, Anthony Kirby, the Wall Street millionaire, is a miserable human being. His whole aim in life is to amass a fortune that he will not be able to spend at all. He is reminded by Vanderhof that his life is worth nothing because he has no friends. Edward Arnold does wonders portraying this unhappy man, in perhaps, the best performance of his long film career. Mr. Arnold was a great actor.The other notable character in the film is Alice Sycamore, the young secretary that happens to fall in love with the rich Kirby heir. In fact, she has the pivotal role of telling off the father of the man she loves because she sees the older Kirby for what he really stands. As Alice, the wonderful Jean Arthur takes the role and makes a splash with it.James Stewart has a minor role in this film, in comparison to the above mentioned ones. Ann Miller is charming as the happy would be ballerina Essie. Spring Byington makes a great Penny, the woman who can write plays in the middle of all the confusion going on in the Vanderhof household. There is a small scene where the incomparable Charles Lane, an actor that has been seen in innumerable films in minor roles, who plays a tax collector. The rest of the cast is excellent.",

            "review_title": "It Always *Is* A Wonderful Life...",
            "content": "I wouldn't exactly call YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU (YCTIWY) Capra's forgotten movie--after all, it *did* win the Best Picture Oscar in its year. And I *have* heard of this film by word of mouth previously, though perhaps not as frequently or with as much ubiquity as some of Capra's other films. Compared to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, for example, YCTIWY distinctly has the status of a 'minor classic'. I don't believe this is deserved, even if themes and (co-)stars are shared between these movies: YCTIWY should definitely be far better known and remembered than it actually is.First of all, the story-telling is flawless. It very cleverly sets up the two very different families, the Vanderhof/Sycamores (an offbeat family trading most importantly in happiness) and the Kirbys (a stiff up tight banking family trading mostly in weapons). To complete the biggest deal of his career, Anthony Kirby Sr (Edward Arnold) must buy up the last house in a neighbourhood, and of course, this house belongs to Martin Vanderhof (a delightful Lionel Barrymore). The movie pleasantly surprised me in *not* having young Tony Kirby (James Stewart) be assigned to get Vanderhof to sell his house and thereby falling in love with Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur) and her zany family. Rather, he was in love with her to begin with, and loved her regardless of what he thought of her family. (Though it would be impossible to hate any of them, I feel!) The story really is simple: Tony loves Alice no matter what, and doesn't want her or her family to put on a show to impress his own family. When he surprises her by turning up a day early for a dinner engagement, the Kirbys meet the Vanderhof/Sycamores for who they truly are, wind up in jail, and along the way, learn a little bit about being real human beings. There are several delightful scenes in the film as well, all beautifully filmed and connected such that the story is a coherent whole. I'm especially partial to practically any scene with James Stewart wooing Jean Arthur (those two, quite seriously, make the cutest couple imaginable)--I love it when he sort of proposes to her. \"Scratch hard enough and you'll find a proposal.\" Or that lovely intimate scene in the park where he directs her to a seat like he would at the ballet, or when they start dancing with the neighbourhood children. The scene in the restaurant was also amusing, when Tony kept warning Alice that there was a scream on the way, building it up so perfectly that *she* wound up screaming before he did. It's hard to beat the scene in night court too, when Capra foreshadows pretty much the exact same scene and sentiment in the forthcoming IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, when all of Vanderhof's friends chip in to pay off his fine. It's sweet, it's real, and it's something you really do wish could still happen in this world. Even the littlest things like Grandpa Vanderhof's dinnertime prayers are enough to remind the viewer of what a world could be like if we kept our values simple, our wants satisfied, and ourselves happy.Second of all, the acting is superlative. How could it *not* be, with a cast like this? Evidently I was completely charmed by James Stewart and Jean Arthur, who are both incredibly believable both as real people and movie stars, and who together make Tony and Alice an utterly credible, true-to-life couple. Edward Arnold was great as the stuffed shirt Anthony Kirby Sr too--his eventual 'thawing' was something that could easily have been played in too exaggerated a fashion, but both the actor and director, I suspect, are too good to have allowed that to happen. I also had great fun watching Ann Miller in her secondary role as Essie Sycamore, Alice's dancing sister. I sincerely hope that every person making this film had just as much fun as I did watching it, because the whole secondary cast was excellent, and I loved all the characters we were introduced to, particularly the entire Sycamore family with their attendant friends (the ex-iceman DePinna, or the toymaker Poppins) and even their servants Rheba and Donald, who were treated almost as much as part of the family as could be expected at that time. But my greatest praise would have to be reserved for Lionel Barrymore as Martin Vanderhof--a sweeter, lovelier old man you just couldn't imagine, and a complete change from his much-better-known Mr. Potter in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. He really does make Grandpa Vanderhof very much a real person, from his reminiscences about Grandma Vanderhof, to his messing around with the IRS agent, to his harmonica-playing and evident love of life and people. I really could not say enough good things about this movie (which I prefer to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE). It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and quite frankly, it'll make you glad to be alive. Not many movies can do that. And it's most certainly true that you can't take your money with you... but what you *can* do is take this movie and its message to heart. 10/10, without a doubt.",

            "content": "With many of the same themes, and indeed many of the same actors, 'You Can't Take It With You' can be considered a sister film to 'It's a Wonderful Life', though preceding it by eight years. It's a romantic comedy but also a study in class differences told at a fascinating point in history, with America still in the Great Depression, and with the world in tumult. A wealthy banker (Edward Arnold) seeks to monopolize the munitions industry prior to the world going to war, but needs to purchase the house owned by eccentrics led by a whimsical old man (Lionel Barrymore). In a convenient coincidence, the banker's son (Jimmy Stewart) is dating the old man's granddaughter (Jean Arthur), and the pair want to get married, so there are two conflicts here.Barrymore is in the role of the good guy, the one who's figured out that material things are less important than having friends and enjoying life. He also understands that you've got to let people be free to explore themselves, and be who they are. He has a charming scene early on with Arthur, listening to her describe her new love, and reminiscing about his deceased wife. He's also the voice of reason about extremism in the world, commenting that everybody was running out to 'get an ism' to solve their problems, e.g. communism or fascism, as opposed to sticking to the principles of America. \"With malice toward none and charity to all,\" he quotes Lincoln, \"Nowadays they say think the way I do or I'll bomb the daylights out of you.\" It's a wonderful character, and well played by Barrymore.Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur are endearing in their roles as well, and they also turn in very good performances. Watch Arthur's small facial reactions in the aforementioned scene with Barrymore, and later when she's with Stewart when he's clowning around in the restaurant and threatening to scream. The idea that the innovation Stewart's character wants to pursue harvesting energy from the sun's rays like plants really made me smile, seeing as this type of green energy sounded so crazy in 1938. The film isn't bullish on the idea per se, but it gets across the point that it's better to have the courage to follow one's dreams, than it is to bury them in a hum-drum existence.There is a joy to the film in this house that Barrymore runs, with inventors in the basement letting off firecrackers, Jean Arthur sliding down the bannister, and her sister (Ann Miller) twirling around to her ballet instructor's direction. On the night Stewart decides to drop in on them as a surprise so that his family can see Arthur's in a true light, Miller is dancing about, Barrymore is tossing darts, his daughter (Spring Byington) is working on an awful old painting of hers with one of the guys posing as a Roman discus thrower, and the servants are dancing delightfully in the kitchen. Everyone is simply being themselves. No one cares how good they are, or exactly how they'll monetize what they're doing. They simply do what they want to do, and have fun at it, letting the money sort itself out in some mysterious way that isn't immediately apparent to us.A lot is made of director Frank Capra's idealism, which may seem na\u00efve to the modern viewer. It's true that this is movie of hope and optimism, but at the same time, Capra was clear-eyed about what was happening in the world. When Barrymore asks the Russian ballet teacher (Mischa Auer) \"Did you bring me any Russian stamps?,\" the latter replies \"No, nobody writes to me, they're all dead,\" which considering Stalin's purges in 1937-38 is a chilling comment slipped in to the script. Capra also recognized the danger of a climate of fear, and through Arthur's character (actually quoting Barrymore's), says that he has a special aversion to those \"the people who commercialize on fear, to sell you something you don't need.\" He's also spot on when it comes to satirizing the ultra-wealthy, and pointing out how unfair the world is when the wealth gap is so large. Edward Arnold's character buys influence in Washington and has a squadron of lawyers and yes-men to help him push his weight around. On the personal side he turns up his nose at the idea of eating humble fare, and his wife (Mary Forbes) haughtily looks down on everyone. As he's about to explain to a bunch of guys in jail how unemployment is \"an emotional problem\", he tosses a cigar away and a horde of them go after it, which is such a perfect metaphor. Capra was a beacon in the darkness, and with his ability to deliver such stirring social messages in delightful movies - making them work on both levels - he should be considered a genius.On the other hand, it's interesting that Barrymore's character has such a casual attitude about money, I mean, one does need to be able to eat. It's a little disturbing that when an IRS agent calls on him, he admits that he's never paid income tax because he \"doesn't believe in it.\" He then goes on to ask where all those dollars go, ridiculing the idea that America needs battleships since they haven't been used since the Spanish-American War (hmmm not so prescient in that comment), and not seeing the irony in the fact that his own servants are \"on relief.\" He'll later say that he was just joking about all this, that he doesn't owe the government a dime, but I just thought this smacked of such backwardness, and counter to all of the programs FDR started that were helping Americans. Later we find out that he was once an executive himself, until one day \"it struck me that I wasn't having any fun.\" I admire the sentiment to prioritize life over amassing a fortune since, after all, you can't take it with you, but it seems a little tone deaf to not recognize the need for some amount of wealth to have this luxury.There are lots of parallels to 'It's a Wonderful Life', including the rich industrialist who has lost his sense of values and is poor in the more important ways in life, the 'little guy' who resists his plans for a monopoly by not selling out to him, and a spontaneous cash collection from friends when one is in trouble. In addition the obvious actors in both films, you'll also find Papa Bailey (Samuel S. Hinds) here, as well as the same raven (Jimmy the raven), who apparently had quite the filmography and collaboration with Capra. In this case Stewart is the scion of the industrialist, not the little guy, and he ultimately quits his dad's company to pursue his own dream, as opposed to finding himself forced to stick around at the ol' Building and Loan. The biggest difference, however is that this film imagines that rich men have souls, and that there is a place deep within that can be reached through friendly overtures and some harmonica music. Perhaps recognizing this was idealistic even by his own standards, it's notable that eight years later, that wasn't the case with Mr. Potter, who was never reached.",

A familiar face on the screen in the thirties and forties, with his round face, solid body, and trademark pince-nez, Arnold surpasses himself in this filmToo often type-cast as a plutocrat, Arnold nevertheless demonstrates nuance and sensitivity as a man who, despite many flaws and faults, is redeemed by his love for his son.  Arnold is seldom credited with the subtlety and poignancy of his characterizations, probably because he generally played greedy capitalists in a time when greedy capitalists were even more frightening than they are (and properly so) now, but this is an omission that should be corrected.  His characterization in this comedy is a powerful performance, and grossly under-appreciated.  He was one of the masters of American cinematic acting, with never a false note on his performances, and it is shameful that he is not so acknowledged.",

            "content": "I've watched this a couple of times, always hoping this time would be an improvement over the last. It hasn't worked. I hate saying that. Not just because there is so much talent invested in what appears to me to be a relative failure -- play by Kaufman and Hart, screenplay by Morrie Riskind, directed by Frank Capra, a cast including Jimmy Stewart, Jean Arthur, and a host of other accomplished performers -- but because my not being able to enjoy it as much as I properly should deprives me of smiles and laughter that there are times I desperately need.Basically, Jimmy Stewart is the scion of a -- well, a not merely \"rich\" family, but an immensely wealthy family able to spend a quarter of a million 1939 dollars a year on lawyers alone. They're humorless, driven, and arid. All except Jimmy, who falls in love with his peppy blond secretary, Jean Arthur.She's normal, but her family and their friends are outlandish. A visit to their household is like a child's fantasy of a mad house. There is the cheerful, tolerant patriarch, Lionel Barrymore, who hasn't paid income taxes in 20 years because he doesn't want to own any battleships. There is his daughter, Ann Miller, imitating a clumsy would-be ballerina who, under the tutelage of her lunatic Russian instructor, dances wildly to Hungarian dances played prestissimo on a wooden xylophone by her sulky husband. One old man poses as a discus thrower for a lousy painter. Another builds fireworks in the basement, which we know are bound to explode sooner or later.It all sounds hilarious, and it must have been a considerable success on the stage. I understand there were a number of changes in the adaptation designed to introduce \"serious\" ideas into the story.Yet, it comes across as thoroughly schematic. The peasants are lively, spiritual, loved by their neighbors, generous, proud of their independence. Their goal is to \"have fun.\" The rich are materialistic and emotionally bankrupt. Until the predictable end, when they are converted to the First Church of Epicurus and its pursuit of ataraxia.If you haven't seen it before, you might not want these comments to discourage you.

Perhaps the closest to the above is \"It Happened One Night\". \"Lost Horizon\" is about rediscovery and peace of mind. \"Mr Smith\" is politically and small town oriented and \"Mr Deeds\" deals with the same except without some political yawn.  George Bailey should have had a better dosage of the \"You Can't Take it With You\" policy in \"It's a Wonderful Life\".\nHere is a play that exercises Frank Capra's famous adage with all humour already built in. Why shouldn't it work? The stage version was a phenomenal success, written superbly by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. If their story is slightly lacking, look no further than the delightful cast of characters. Mr Poppins, toy and mask maker. Alice's Father who meddles with fireworks. Essie the ballerina, Penny the playwright and the wonderful Russian ballet teacher. The uptight Kirby banking corporation. Then there's the \"Mr Smith\" duo, Tony (Jimmy Stewart) and Alice (Jean Arthur). The stand out performer here, is naturally the lovable Lionel Barrymore as Grandpa Vanderfhoff. Although the first film in which the damaging effects of his arthritis began to show, Capra had his leg put in a cast and had him move around on crutches. He relishes his performance. I have heard of complaints which discuss the fact this film fails to address corruption and greed in a similar manner to \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" which successfully played its part going against the American capital. Once again, Capra emphasises his favourite theme of the little guy up against the world and succeeds, but \"You Can't Take it With You\" basically does not even make a mild attempt to criticise the American system of government, past or present, even though I know very little about it. On different levels, look at this film in the light of discussing heavier issues, as the aforementioned greed and corruption. I just don't think Mr Capra would have liked it as much for one of his works to be remembered like that, especially with the basic message staring at us right in the face. \nNevertheless, it is another of Capra's life saving feel good movies. All it is encouraging us to do is to have a little fun. Rating: 8/10",

But the different lifestyles of the two families comes between the couple after a crazy night where everything that can go wrong does.A sheer delight from one of the legendary directors of yesteryear. This is the first of three collaborations between Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart. I doubt I have to tell anybody what the other two were since they're well-known classics. Well this one deserves wider praise because it's simply magical. The four leads are all perfect. Stewart and Arthur have amazing chemistry that they would repeat the following year in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.

Two immensely talented actors that never gave a bad performance (that I've seen). You always get your money and time's worth with these two.

It's one of those films, like Sullivan's Travels or Lady for a Day, that just gets better and better each time I see it. The first time I saw it was probably close to twenty years ago. I liked it then but I love it now. This movie leaves a huge smile on my face and I think, unless you're an extreme cynical type, it will do the same for you.

Kirby (Edward Arnold). Kirby Sr. is dealing a monopoly in the trade of weapons, and needs to buy one last house in a twelve block area owned by Alice's grandparent Martin Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore). However, Martin is the patriarch of an anarchic and eccentric family where the members do not care for money but for having fun and making friends. When Tony proposes Alice, she states that it would be mandatory to introduce her simple and lunatic family to the snobbish Kirbys, and Tone decides to visit Alice with his parents one day before the scheduled. There is an inevitable clash of classes and lifestyles, the Kirbys spurn the Sycamores and Alice breaks with Tony, changing the lives of the Kirby family.The humanist Frank Capra certainly was a shine man. His movies, at least those I have seen again and again, are very beautiful, with wonderful messages of love and harmony and many nominations and awards. I have just watched \"You Can Take It With You\" for the second and third time, sixty-nine years after its release, and again I loved his direction, the story, the performances, the cinematography and mostly, the awesome message in the end. Lionel Barrymore and Edward Arnold have a magnificent duel of philosophies of life, and Jean Arthur and James Stewart a perfect chemistry in this lovely romantic comedy. The crazy Sycamore family is responsible for the funniest moments, in a house that looks like an insane asylum. Men like Frank Capra give hope and make our world better, and I believe right in this moment Frank Capra is in Heaven listening to \"Polly Wolly Doodle\" and dancing the \"Big Apple\". My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Do Mundo, Nada Se Leva\" (\"From the World, Nothing is Taken\")",

            "content": "Anthony P Kirby is a wealthy banker. In order to clinch his next deal his company, Kirby & Company, is buying up all the properties in a neighbourhood. Everyone has sold, except one. Martin Vanderhof won't budge, not for any offer. He is happy where he is, living with his daughter, son-in-law, two granddaughters, grandson- in-law and a few other people in a community largely free of life's pressures. Mr Kirby's son, Tony, is a new-appointed Vice President of Kirby & Company and is in love with his secretary, Alice Sycamore, Mr Vanderhof's granddaughter. Their relationship, and the property issue, puts the two families, the Kirbys and Vanderhofs, on a collision course. It's more than a clash of families but a clash of outlooks, ideals and what's important in life.Directed by Frank Capra who later went on to direct It's A Wonderful Life. Like It's A Wonderful Life, You Can't Take It With You has a warm, fuzzy, sugary-sweet yet noble and liberating central message. In It's A Wonderful Life, Capra surrounded that message with a wonderful plot, beautifully and sensitively executed. With You Can't Take It With You, the execution is flawed, to the point that it negates the message.From the beginning of You Can't Take It With You there is a folksiness and raw, na\u00efve idealism that makes the movie seem more like a children's fantasy than profoundly-themed adult drama. No subtlety at all and it only gets worse once we meet the collection of oddballs in the commune. They were meant to provide light entertainment but for the most part they are silly and irritating. Particularly irritating was the Russian guy. I presume his schtick was meant to be funny, but really he is just an obnoxious dickhead. Xylophone guy was also pretty bad \u2013 pretty much a rednecked simpleton.So, little to no engagement with the \"good guys\" of the piece. Add to this the fact that Capra draws Kirby as a pretty much stereotypical, one-dimensional heartless villain and we have a movie with little in the way of character depth. In fact, I was so disengaged, the more silly the \"heroes'\" antics became, and the more Capra turned Kirby into a cartoon villain, the more, out of a sense of rebellion, I rooted for Kirby!Ending can be spotted a mile off, the movie is that predictable.Thankfully Capra didn't try to duplicate the formula when he made It's A Wonderful Life.",

            "content": "Let's face it--time has not been kind to this one.YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU is played so broadly and written with such simplistic and obvious platitudes coming from the mouths of its cast, that I can't possibly see why the Academy voted it Best Picture of 1938. After all, everyone knows money isn't everything.Today, whatever charm it may have had has dimmed very much over the years and it appears more dated and foolish than ever. The household of eccentric bohemians are supposed to be wildly funny, but instead they become more than mildly annoying, especially when they have anything to say--which, unfortunately, is quite often. As is often the case when a film is based on a stage play, there is too much fast paced dialog going on at almost any given moment.Not even stars like JEAN ARTHUR and JAMES STEWART can overcome this sort of Capra-corn which is so thick you could cut it with a pocketknife. You have to be in a mood to watch this, willing to suspend all belief in reality and succumb to the notion that doing nothing for a living is better than having an honest job or worrying about the rent. So simplistic are the messages trying to get through that it becomes clear we are just supposed to sit back and watch the shenanigans of a bunch of eccentrics play out to a silly and predictable conclusion.In a year that included such standouts as THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, considered a classic piece of cinema entertainment in gorgeous three-strip technicolor, it's sad to learn that Capra's stagey comedy, hammed up by a large cast that plays the comedy for sledgehammer delivery, was the winner in 1938. Furthermore, most of the unrestored prints available today are not easy to view, with a muffled soundtrack and dark prints.Whatever social significance the Academy found in this one is buried under tons of broad characterizations and contrived situations.",

            "review_title": "Two Reasons Why This Movie Is Not Very Funny",
            "content": "Though Frank Capra movies are typically classified as comedies, yet they really are not that funny. One reason is that they come across as homilies, and as there is nothing humorous about moralizing, there is an inconsistent tone throughout. Worse yet, the moral of his movies tends to be so simplistic as to have no practical value. Some of his movies are better than others, of course. But notwithstanding the fact that it got the Academy Award for Best Picture, this is not one of them.The message in this movie in particular is that everyone ought to just do whatever he wants to do. Well, I don't know about you, but if I did what I wanted to do, no one would pay me for it. I like watching movies and writing reviews like this, and if someone wants to pay me to do so, I'll be happy to take his money. But until I retired (and could finally do what I wanted), I spent thirty-five years holding down a job that wasn't much fun. It wasn't a bad job, as jobs go, but it was not what I wanted to do, which was mostly just take it easy and have a good time.The movie centers on a family that embodies this principle of doing whatever you want to do. Grandpa Vanderhof supposedly collects stamps and is able to make money off his expertise, even though it is not clear how. His daughter writes plays, though we doubt she publishes them. His son-in-law and another man fool around with firecrackers in the basement, supposedly selling them from time to time. One of his granddaughters, Essie, takes ballet lessons, so she represents an expense rather than providing an income. And so it goes. There is only one person in the household, Essie's sister Alice, who holds down a real job, as a secretary, which would seem to violate the principle of doing whatever you want to do; but in any event, her income could hardly support the rest of the household. I suppose I should mention they have a full-time maid, who also is their cook, and they live in a house worth $25,000 in 1938 dollars, which adjusted for inflation would be over $400,000 today (at one point they are offered $100,000 for the house, or about $1,670,000, adjusted for inflation).Doing what you want apparently includes not paying your income taxes. When an Internal Revenue Agent shows up to talk to Grandpa Vanderhof because he never files income tax returns, he says he doesn't believe in paying taxes because he doesn't care for the things the money is spent on. This completely confounds the IRS agent, as if the agency had never had to deal with that attitude before. When warned by Alice's fianc\u00e9, Tony Kirby, that he might get in trouble, Grandpa says he really doesn't owe the IRS any money. I guess that stamp-collecting expertise hasn't been all that remunerative after all.By now you may be thinking that I have missed the whole point, that this is just a comedy. Well, that brings us back to my original point. The movie just is not that funny. And because it is not very funny, I had time to reflect upon the sermon being preached by this movie, which I concluded was absurd for the reasons just given.The ridiculous moral lesson of this movie is not the only thing that works against the intended humor. The movie is more manic than funny. We are supposed to be delighted by this crazy household, when in reality, none of us could stand being in that living room for more than a few minutes. You would not have to be a stuffed shirt like Tony's father or a snob like Tony's mother to be appalled that your son wanted to marry into a family like that.",

I have found most of the comedies (the Marx Brothers are an exception) of that time period aren't very funny these days. Humor has changed a lot.There is a crazy family in this film and these crackpots are pretty humorous the first time you see them, in their first scene, but not the subsequent ones. They only get more and more annoying as you hear them.The romance between Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur is sappy and bogs down the film. How they advertise that Arthur is the beautiful lead female romantic in here amazes me. She was talented actress but \"beautiful\" or \"glamorous?\" Hardly, plus she had an awful voice. She does better as a comedienne or straight dramatic actress than playing the \"beautiful romantic\" as one known national critic labeled her. Maybe it is just this film because normally I like Arthur, but she's awful in here.When you add Lionel Barrymore, Edward Arnold, Micha Auer and Spring Byington and have the famous Frank Capra directing, you would think this is going to be topnotch, but the movie is anything but impressive or entertaining, especially now in this day-and-age. In fact, many parts of this story have such an absence of credibility to them that you'll cringe watching. With the big awards it won, I expected a better movie.",

I just get bored.The idea of a house of free-spirited eccentrics is an appealing one, but the film's determined effort to show wackiness and chaos feels forced, and the characters are, for the most part, determinedly one- dimensional. Much of the problem is there's no true philosophy behind it. It's a movie where the grand patriarch makes vaguely Libertarian remarks but ultimately just seems to be into a sort of Americana ethos with no specifics to it. It's a movie that says we should follow our dreams, but the residents have no money worries and employ (black) servants who are not themselves encouraged to follow *their* dreams. These aren't artsy bohemians, these are just people with a lot of time on their hands.Thus, I not only find the movie dull but, as I continue watching, increasingly objectionable.

            "content": "The combination of director Frank Capra and actor James Stewart resulted in two of my favorite films of all-time: It's A Wonderful Life & Mr. Smith Goes To Washington. As such, I decided to give this effort a try. What I found was a movie that takes a bit to \"get going\", but when it does produces a satisfying conclusion and quite a bit of fun along the way.For a very basic overview, \"You Can't Take It With You\" is built upon this premise: banking tycoon Anthony Kirby (Edward Arnold) desperately needs to acquire one plot of land for his next money-making scheme. The holder of that land? Free-spirited Martin Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore)--whose granddaughter Alice (Jean Arthur) just happens to be smitten with Anthony's son Tony (Stewart). Hilarity ensues!Unlike \"Wonderful Life\" & \"Mr. Smith\"--two rather serious flicks at heart--this one is more of a screwball comedy in tone. Many scenes and characters are played more for laughs than anything, and the first 30-40 minutes of the picture will make you wonder if anything substantial will come from it whatsoever.Yet, as Capra is known to do, he manages to use that wacky early character development to set the stage for the message of the film to arise, that being a sort of \"what is the nature of happiness?\" theme. The Kirbys (stuffy, uptight money barons) are contrasted with the Vanderhofs (free-spirited artists) in rather interesting and meaningful ways. Though the setting, clothing, and manner of speech are of course different from more modern films, the overall themes do a remarkable job of remaining relevant through Capra's lens.\"You Can't Take It With You\" was also a sort of \"history lesson\" for me in the sense that I noticed so many interesting Old-Hollywood details. For example...-Seeing Stewart in a supporting role (not the lead) was intriguing.-Having Barrymore--the ultimate villain Potter in \"Wonderful Life\"--as the sympathetic good guy here was a bit dis-jointing at first, but his acting talent quickly won me over.-This being a Columbia production, I recognized many actors and locations from the old Three Stooges shorts produced by that studio.Overall, I have to say I enjoyed \"You Can't Take It With You\" far more than I ever thought I would. The romantic comedy genre isn't my favorite as far as films go--so this will never eclipse Capra's more serious efforts for me--but I found this to be masterfully directed with the way Capra focuses the screwball nature of the flick's beginning to real character payoffs in the end.",

            "content": "Unjustly forgotten screwball comedy about class differences, marred only by a sappy, antiquated message that money won't buy happiness. Having no money and playing the harmonica apparently will. But then again, this was made for Depression-era audiences, so the notion of money as the root of all evil and being happy derived without benefit of money must have been a sure crowd pleaser in its time. Very populist, right down to repeated crowd shots of everyday folks in a courtroom scene. Jean Arthur lives with an eccentric, extended family that does not worry about money (although its is made plain early on that family patriarch Lionel Barrymore earned quite a bit of moolah in his time, so no one in this crazy family need worry about where their next meal is coming from or whether they will have a roof over their heads. Heck, they even have a pair of black servants! Arthur falls in love with her boss at the bank, played by rising start Jimmy Stewart. Stewart's stuffy old dad, bank president Edward Arnold, is all about money and status, nothing else. A plot element has Arnold trying to buy Barrymore's house for some nefarious project. Arthur insists on Stewart's family meeting her family before they tie the knot. You can imagine what transpires when they finally gather (collide might be a better word) for dinner at the Barrymore household. We get a little bit of \"A Christmas Carol\" thrown in when an old tycoon and crony of Arnold's, now destitute, confronts Arnold about his greedy and sinful ways. For this scene, the camera is stationed behind and to the left of the old tycoon, with Arnold standing several feet away intently and silently listening to him. We never get thee expected reverse shot as the tycoon delivers his sermon. Only after he finishes his speech and turns to leave, do we see him plainly. In this way, the fellow seem almost spectral and unreal, like Marley's ghost, and this makes his speech all the more powerful. Or maybe it's just me. A stellar supporting cast includes Donald Meek, Spring Byington, Mischa Auer, Eddie Anderson, Harry Davenport and several others. By today's standards, the film is much too preachy and dated. But it is still lots of fun. Wait until you see the wildly improbable jail sequence about halfway through.",

I remember, years ago, preparing for and appearing in this great play for the Academy of Dramatic Arts. Our class never had so much fun putting it together, even though we missed a few lines here and there, but regardless, it is the very best example in story telling, if not one liners. You also come away with the feeling that there's a tad eccentricity in all of us, combined with a lot of good will, AND maybe that's what its all about.

Even if there are problems with his films, I do think there is something to be said about the expressed ideals at the end of the films. This one concerns a Bohemian household living in New York City, led by a benign Grandfather played by Lionel Barrymore. His granddaughter (Jean Arthur) is set upon marrying her boss's son (Jimmy Stewart), who is also deeply in love with her. Stewart's father (Edward Arnold) is a bank president, and he only needs to buy Barrymore's property in order to complete the biggest business deal of his life. When the Bohemian household meets up with the cold-hearted banker and his wife, sparks fly, sometimes literally. The movie is pretty radical, basically promoting anarchy. Barrymore doesn't think he should have to pay taxes, even though no viewer can miss that members of his household pose a major fire hazard with their basement-produced fireworks. But, really, these characters are broad and extreme for the sake of comedy. In reality, You Can't Take It with You is a powerful statement of the values of individuality. The bank president villain is often thought of as shallow, but the point is that he, his business associates, and the members of his social class are set on looking at anyone who is below them as unimportant. Individualism is a cornerstone of the American culture, and, despite some major flaws in the corners of this film, its message is an overwhelmingly positive one.",

The patriarch, played by Lionel Barrymore, is an ex-businessman who believes in simple values, in following your dreams, and in loving thy neighbor. His granddaughter, portrayed by Spring Byington, writes plays because a typewriter was mistakenly delivered to the house; her husband plays with fireworks in the basement; her daughter dances en pointe around the house; the dance teacher eats with them and has the maid do his laundry - etc. It's a chaotic, fun household where the nightly prayer at dinner ends with \"We have our health. We leave the rest to You.\" Jean Arthur is Alice, Barrymore's granddaughter, who lives with her family in the house and works in a bank. She falls in love with Jimmy Stewart (in his star-making role) and there the fun begins, as Stewart introduces his staid, money-grubbing, social-climbing parents into his future wife's household. What follows is a delightful clash.It seems that post-depression and pre-World War II, there was an emphasis on basic values and family - not so much the strict \"family values\" of today, but more a live and let live, and what's the point of killing yourself to make a living if you're not happy. \"The Magnificent Dope\" has a very similar theme. It's refreshing to see these kinds of films and to be reminded of this wonderful philosophy. \"You Can't Take It With You\" is a brilliant playing out of this lifestyle, filled with delightful performances, right down to the neighbors. I don't agree that it's dated - I think it's as timely as ever, right down to the references about solar power.",

Capra wants us to think that these nutcases, because they do whatever they please and spend so much time together rather than accumulate money, are living a perfect life. If such a bohemian philosophy leaves you dirt poor and acting like a bunch of escaped mental patients, then get me a job as a 9-to-5 bank clerk pronto.If you disagree with the central premise, then you really have no room to maneuver. I suffered through scene after scene of sappy speeches and events pertaining to the views of Mr Capra, each one more tiresome than the last. Rich = Unhappy and no idea of community. Poor = Salt of the earth and always there for each other. What a crock. Capra's other films may have extolled the same virtues, but at least they didn't ram them down our throats. And they had the added advantage of having non-annoying characters and well thought out plots. Watching this is was for me akin to listening to a lecture by a BNP representative... I don't agree with your opinions, and that's all you have to offer. So... I quit. 4/10",

Fair enough I suppose.You'll find a lot of those in the 30's, where America was trying to find itself and was toying with socialist ideas that today seem radical. At the same time, movies were trying on several ideas in a quest to discover what they were.Both of these exploratory periods are largely forgotten today and the options they offered aren't grieved as they should have been.This play was a sentimental screed on the terrors of capitalism, and how it necessarily destroys the soul of everyone who participates. The bad guy drives competitors to death, aspires to be the world's largest arms provider, a monopoly in fact. Bankers = bad. Dropouts - good.There's an inserted bit where our hero (Barrymore) refuses to pay taxes on the grounds that they do nothing useful. And another (from the play) where inept cops arrest the crowd as suspected Soviet revolutionaries. They are tossed in a cell with folks obviously there because of financial injustices.Its entertaining enough, and if you thought \"Wonderful Life\" was a great film, you'll like this too. You'll probably like \"V for Vendetta\" also, as it is a similar simpleminded polemic wrapped in a minimum of cinematic sugar. Same core, different sugar.And it is the sugar, after all that makes this work.In the similar, later one for Stewart, \"Pot O Gold,\" the characters weren't comical. They did comical things, but none of them were ridiculous, even the greedy capitalist who, like in this, needs to buy a house and is thwarted by happy campers.This script is different (Pulitzer-winning, incidentally). Silly characters populate the thing: A girl who imagines herself a ballerina and can't stop dancing; her dope husband who still thinks he is on the College football team; a man obsessed with fireworks; another with mechanical toys and so on. A large Russian visitor who comes for the free meals and whose opinion of everything is: \"It stinks.\" Black jitterbugging servants.Beware, you'll like this little confection, and even buy the message within as a result. Or you'll wish you lived in a so-called \"simpler time\" during which this simple wrapper and message worked.If you come to these old things because you like one of the actors, let me point out Ann Miller as the dance-obsessed wife. She was 14 at the time, having lied about her age to get the job. What an amazing presence she was, even then.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",

            "content": "YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU The film is a romantic comedy that at times treated very serious topic. The rich snobs against wacky, eccentric but, it seems to me very nice people. Conflict of family, property and way of thinking. Meeting of two different social categories shaken \"most beautiful\" thing in the world - love. My impression is that most Capra's protagonist finds happiness in small things. Of course, there must be a difference between a good and successful man. These little things may act strange, but certainly not negligible. Source of happiness and satisfaction is at hand, only it needs to be open.Martin \"Grandpa\" Vanderhof's (Lionel Barrymore) house is the film's utopian space. All are happy and satisfied, somewhat eccentric and definitely crazy. Of course, everyone is doing only what they want. Penny Sycamore (Spring Byington), Vanderhof's daughter, writes plays because a typewriter was accidentally sent to the house eight years ago. Her daughter, Essie Carmichael (Ann Miller), practices dance even though she exhibits no talent for it. Ed Carmichael (Dub Taylor), Essie's husband, plays xylophone in order to accompany her dancing. The house in which all are welcome. The basement is the right valley of creativity.Important segments of the story are the government and capital. One individual resists both. Grandpa Martin Vanderhof is incredibly calm and positive character and he \"protest\" in a specific way. You Can't Take It With You also subtly links class with gender. Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur), of the lower middle-class, is engaged to Tony Kirby (James Stewart), son of millionaire. This proportion is slightly idealized. How important vision is? The vision is temporary? At different moments of most of the characters accept the truth in this or that way. For this reason I do not like the idyllic ending of the film. I convinced myself that this is a romantic comedy.Capra has again been very careful with cinematography, framing and dialogue. Acting is at a high level. Of course Lionel Barrymore is masterly. The film is a good way out of the dark for two hours. It's very funny.",

The eccentric scenes are great, with dancing and music for no real reason. There is a discussion of income taxes and what good they serve.

Not to mention, the creative (to this day) storytelling devices used (harmonica, Mr.Vanderhof's home, Big Apple, to name a few) to drive film's point. Jimmy Stewart looking handsome as ever and playing his rich boy role to perfection. Jean Arthur, despite having a less important role than usual, still looking as gorgeous as ever. The rest of the cast, most of them are incredibly funny. Some scenes with Poppins & Donald would make you pause so you finish laughing before the next funny moment comes. Its not just laughter, the movie has an important message that's just as relevant today. Lionel Barrymore plays Mr. Vanderhof, the grandpa everyone of us love to have. It drags a little towards the end, but never stops being funny & unpredictable. On a side note, I felt sour that Alice was very unfair to Tony towards the end! Also felt Ed Arnold's Mr. Kirby was not such a bad father as the movie tries to portray him as. He obliges when his son takes him on an adventure to his secy girl friend's madhouse! And held is composure for the most part. Definitely being rich alone could not be such a sin; I wish he was a bit more unenlightened as he seemed. Due to this reason, Capra, usually very sharp in his social commentary went overboard a bit there, I thought. But all that made up by that super entertaining climax scene! So beautifully shot by Capra. I'd watch the whole movie all over again just to embrace that gorgeous ending Capra manages everytime (a la It Happened One Night, Its a Wonderful Life)",

But it's still a nice dream and it's a pleasure to be carefree for two hours while watching this wonderful movie. James Stewart was fine in this picture, but he didn't really figure that prominently in it; I was much more interested in the Lionel Barrymore grandfather who long ago decided to have some fun in life and leave everything else behind, and Stewart's stuffy old rich father (well played by Edward Arnold), who eventually learns that money really means nothing in the end. ***1/2 out of ****",

As these folks are now facing older age & death, they are finding out they can't.

And the chunk of plot that was added for the movie version--the lengthy courtroom scene--attempts to open the movie up and give us some of that traditional Capra aw-shucksness, but it feels like exactly what it is--tacked on material that was never meant to exist in the first place and only succeeds in making the film feel longer than it should be.It's got a good cast though. Jean Arthur is always adorable, and I'll watch a movie just because she's in it. Spring Byington plays the dotty family matriarch, a stock role in 30's movies, very well. The best performance probably comes from Lionel Barrymore: he seems beleaguered by a world that just won't let him and his family *be*, and your heart goes out to him.Not a bad way to spend a couple of hours, but you'd do better to watch \"It Happened One Night\" if you have a taste for screwball Capra.Grade: B",

            "content": "I don't believe in following any crowd, getting involved in trends I consider ridiculous, and hanging out with people I consider pretentious or fools. That being said, the eccentric family lead by Lionel Barrymore is by far the wackiest on screen, sometimes a bit too much, but oh how much fun they have. Toss in the staid wealthy Kirby family, secretly trying to buy up all the surrounding family and get them out to put in a smelly factory. Once again in this Frank Capra comedy (based upon a much revived Broadway play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart), Edward Arnold is the heavy, as powerful here as he would be in \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" and \"Meet John Doe\", but not nearly as evil. It's only because he's in a comedy that he's not classified as a villain, and to lighten his load (as only he can), Arnold shows a sly amusement to the surroundings he's thrust into when he shows up on the wrong night with wife Mary Forbes and some James Stewart, who just happens to be engaged to Barrymore's granddaughter (Jean Arthur).Several normally \"straight\" actors get to show off their comedic side, having a ball, but oh what a silly bunch of funny entertainers there are, including Spring Byington as Barrymore's playwright daughter (complete with a live paper weight kitten), Ann Miller as Arthur's ballerina sister, Lillian Yarbo and Eddie \"Rochester\" Anderson as the servants, treated like members of the family, Donald Meek as a wacky inventor and Mischa Auer as a wild Russian lothario. Two of Hollywood's snarkiest character actors (Charles Lane and Clarence Wilson) are foils for Barrymore who get a great comeuppance.While this doesn't have the social messages of Capra's original comedy dramas, it does show the ridiculousness of the elite, whether the snobby Forbes or the power hungry Arnold. Barrymore even gets to take a swing at the IRS (Charles Lane as the exasperated auditor), giving plenty of laughs to a country coming out of the depression. While I don't consider the best film of 1938 (certainly though in the top 10), it is one of the best screwball comedies of the 1930's, and nostalgic and popular enough to still be revived on Broadway as evidenced by a recent hit production with James Earl Jones in the Barrymore role.",

            "content": "\"You Can't Take It with You\" is an American black-and-white movie from 1938 that is based on a play and was directed by Frank Capra, one of the most successful filmmakers from his time. It runs for over 2 hours, pretty long for back then and as you can see by the poster here on imdb, this one has a pretty big ensemble cast. You can say that it is in the widest sense also a bit of a Romeo & Juliet story line thingey without the real drama and tragedy as this one has a young couple with very different families fall for each other. The families only somewhat despise each other, well the male's despises the female's for the most part if we ignore the happy ending. But on the road to that, there are many obstacles to master. The most known cast member here is probably James Stewart still under the age of 30 and maybe not yet at his very best because to me his over-the-top turn playing the male protagonist was perhaps the thing that did not work out the most in this movie. It's tough to say if it was more the script that is to blame here or his performance, maybe a mix of both. And I am not even talking about his idea to arrange the meeting a day earlier than expected, which was pretty unsurprising because it went os much against his initial plan to avoid the meeting at all that he now wants his parents to see the other family how they really were. Also how did the man's father not realize they are at the house that they just cannot get? I mean there was so much talking about the trouble it causes, so I would have thought he'd know right away. Aside from that, I hought the woman's grandfather's decision and execution when it came to selling the house really out of nowhere felt also rushed. If one man I would have thought discusses this with everybody, his family, maybe also his naighbor who sort of rely on him, then it would be him. And my last criticism has only indirectly to do with the film because I am really baffled to see that Spring Byington got the only Oscar nomination from the cast here. No clue why though, she had no material really and she also did not elevate a nothing character into something great. If anybody had deserved the nomination here, then it is Lionel Barrymore who was simply amazing. Probably five other people would have deserved the nomination more than Byington, perhaps all or almost all of them men. There are many female characters in here too, but they hardly have the material to really make an impact and that also comehow includes lead actress Jean Arthur. Still sometimes they manage to light up the screen like Ann Miller does with her dancing. So do the males too like Poppins and Kolenkhov, who are both amazing scene stealers, every time they are on. Take the former's talk about his inventions, his masks or the latter's references to ulcers. In general, it is a pretty established cast, some Oscar winners, others Oscar nominees and those without awards recognition have still enjoyed long careers in the industry.Now as for the movie itself, I thought it was really charming and had great attention to detail. I am pretty surprised though it did win the Oscar not only for Best Director, but also for Best Picture, while coming short in the writing category and for all the other nominations it scored. There is a lot of tongue-in-cheek comedy in here with a story-line that also resembled Asterix a bit. I can't be the only one who thought of that. Anyway, nonetheless there is also some emotional and dramatic relevance. One of my favorite scenes was when we have Grandpa talk about the more serious reason why he wants to stay in that house, namely that he feels his deceased wife is still in every corner (another reason he would never sell it, come on!). Or the parallel between how he stopped torturing himself with strenuous worklife and how Stewart's character's father eventually does the same when he decides to go down in the elevator. The harmonica on the table is also a constant temptation, there they are playing a bit with the audience because everybody who did not know the film probably thought he'd take it and play on it on his own when everybody left the room. But he wasn't that far yet at this point. And the title reference I really love too. Pay close attention or you may miss it. I will spare you the explanation, it is better if you experience it yourself. It sounds like such a random sentence, but it rings very very true for everybody who was in a similar situation once or just thought a lot about the subject of disposable wealth. Lets call it that, that should not spoil too much, even if I crossed the field next to \"spoilers included\". Another brief moment I liked was when the female protagonist realizes it is her family who is the better one and there is no need to be ashamed of them. Not one bit. This also goes well with the many friends the grandpa has. Even the judge thinks it is unusual. At some point the mess int he courtroom just becomes too much and even the judge surrenders and smiles. Maybe in terms of law and authorities, this film should not be taken too seriously, also referring to the guy who leaves after being shocked by the loud fireworks noise. Back to the smiling judge, these minor smiles are fun on several occasions. One hilarious example is too when the female protagonist's sister says to the male protagonists' mother that spirituality is nonsense and we see the mother's husband chuckle. That was great fun. Edward Arnold was really good in general, he deserves special emphasis on his performance, also because he is perhaps the one character with the biggest transformation and that means quite something because he is just a supporting player, even if he has more screen time than most others, especially in the second half. I hesitated for a little while if I should give this film really 4 stars out of 5 and not just 3, but the joyful ending with the music and even the man's mother suddenly softening up (that was surprising, amybe slightly unrealistic even with how she was before thatg all the time) made it easy for me to make this decision and from all I have seen from the year 1938 (which is admittedly not much in terms of full feature films), this is at this point my favorite film of the year pretty much on par with Leni Riefenstahl's amazing documentary work about the Olympic Games that took place in Berlin 2 years earlier. But lets not drift away now. \"You Can't Take It with You\" is a film that you should definitely take the DVD with you from your local story and also if there is one thing to take with you from this review, then it is that you really should not lose out on watching this one. I highly recommend it, unless you really really hate old b&w films, but maybe even then, it is a good choice because it can open things up a bit and you will see that there is great quality out there from this era.

            "content": "Nearly forty years ago, I had the role of Kolenkhov in my high school's presentation of \"You Can't Take It With You\", and it took all that time to get around to seeing the Oscar winning film today. Watching it brought back some great memories, along with a question. How is it that this film hasn't achieved the type of recognition accorded to \"It's A Wonderful Life\", also directed by Frank Capra? Both explore similar themes with stellar casts, and defined life's simple values against a backdrop of big business greed. One can only wonder.What's not hard to understand though is how quickly the Sycamore Family grabs you with their zany lifestyle under patriarch Grandpa Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore). He's clearly the voice of reason in the maelstrom of a New York City neighborhood in the shadow of Wall Street. He's also the conscience of a community that comes to rely on his status as the lone holdout against a major munitions manufacturer that wants to buy up the block for a new business enterprise.As daunting as that task sounds, it's the subtle and sometimes not so subtle subtext that comes across more forcefully in the day to day life of the Sycamore home. At any given moment, different members of the family take center stage, each with their own unique personalities precariously balanced above a basement filled with home made explosives. When the inevitable Fourth of July demonstration finally erupts, you've already been conditioned to accept it as just another day with Grandpa Vanderhof.Though most of the movie followed along the lines of the play as I remember it, there was a great additional scene in the park with Tony Kirby (James Stewart) and Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur) where the local kids teach them how to do the 'Big Apple'. As a couple, you just knew Alice and Tony were destined for each other, no matter what the script threw their way.And what a gold mine of supporting players! Edward Arnold as the magnate Kirby, Mischa Auer as Russian ballet instructor Kolenkhov (It steenks!), Spring Byington, Dub Taylor, H.B. Warner and most surprising of all - Eddie Anderson as household servant Donald. He and Lillian Yarbo were generally afforded dignity in their roles as domestics, though there was an unfortunate 'boy' reference thrown at Donald along the way.Even after all this time I was still able to pick off lines before they were spoken, and couldn't help recalling classmates that filled each role. It was especially a moving way to recall my best friend at the time who portrayed Grandpa Vanderhof; he received standing ovations at each performance. I found myself wishing he were watching the movie with me, but he passed away a dozen years ago. That added another dimension to the harmonica duet, a scene that already had enough poignancy to elicit a couple of tears.",

            "content": "As a lifelong fan of It's a Wonderful Life, I always like to cite players from that-my favorite movie-whenever I review other movies they got involved in. Besides director Frank Capra, there are the players of James Stewart, Lionel Barrymore, Samuel S. Hinds, H.B. Warner, Ward Bond, and Charles Lane that would eventually do that one. One other note before reviewing the movie proper-Having just seen Dub Taylor playing the government official who gave Andy Griffith's Will Stockdale his draft notice and accusing him of being a draft dodger in No Time for Sergeants, here he is in his film debut some 20 years before playing a character not too different from Will as he's just as happy-go-lucky here as Stockdale was there! Okay, so after 30 years of reading about this-not to mention having once auditioned for the part of Mr. Henderson when in high school and not getting it but enjoying the performance of my fellow drama club members when playing it just the same-I finally got to see this on Netflix disc and it was as enjoyable as I imagined it could be. Besides those players I just mentioned, I also liked seeing Eddie Anderson-just before becoming Rochester on Jack Benny's radio show-as Donald, Donald Meek as the guy who quits his job to invent things, Edward Arnold as Stewart's father, leading lady Jean Arthur as the \"crazy\" family's ing\u00e9nue, Spring Byington as Ms. Arthur's mother, and Ann Miller as the ballerina. With Capra on board, there's as much good drama scenes as comedy and while there may be some logic problems as the way things end, there's mostly a feel-good atmosphere throughout that's simply infectious! So on that note, I highly recommend You Can't Take It with You.",

            "content": "\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\", though replete with exaggeratedly patriotic idealism and sharing the white hat/black hat dualism of contemporary westerns, worked perfectly well because at its core it painted a true picture of government's susceptibility to corruption, a picture that rings even truer today than when the picture was made. It also boasted a script that had some real dramatic tension, beautifully carried out by Jimmy Stewart.However, this effort, released just a year earlier, tries to hang the same ideals - faceless, heartless, and greedy corporate (as opposed to governmental in \"Mr. Smith\") anonymity versus the charming goodness of \"little folks\" - on much shakier plot devices. The quirkiness of the Vanderhof/Sycamore household is totally contrived, and the aristocratic snottiness of the Kirbys is drawn with an absurdly broad brush. Jimmy Stewart, who carried \"Mr. Smith\", has much less to do here and does it much less effectively. The whole thing just doesn't ring true enough to give us any sense of sympathy at the final resolution. As an aside, note how the Judge, wonderfully played by Harry Davenport, foreshadows the role of the Senate President in \"Mr. Smith\", even to the odd way he rests his head against his right hand as he surveys the chaotic chamber before him with resigned bemusement. Too similar to be done other than intentionally.",

            "content": "We all have dreams, aspirations and desires that never seem to come to fruition. Maybe it's because they seem to frivolous or unimportant or impossible for our time. Whatever the reason, we can all learn a lesson or two from the Vanderhof and Sycamore family; a family so tightly bound with one another it would make any dysfunctional family insanely jealous. What is so unique about these people is how they all do exactly what is the desire of their heart. The mother writes plays, the daughter dances, the father makes fireworks and a few other people find their way into the house and get swept up in the same fervor.The patriarch of this clan is Grandpa, played with incredible joy and sincerity by the great Lionel Barrymore, who is unquestionably one of the finest and most versatile actors of all time. He was perfect as the curmudgeon Mr. Potter in It's A Wonderful Life, and here is the complete opposite; a man who loves life and knows the importance of spending your time wisely doing something you love.What shakes everyone up is the fact that their daughter, Alice, gets involved with Tony Kirby, son of the famous and ruthless banker AP Kirby trying to seal a deal which requires him to buy out the Vanderhof house. Of course they refuse, and one very funny scene leads to another until the stuck-up and pretentious Kirby's get a culture shock when they meet this eccentric but completely genuine family. Directed by perhaps the most genuine of all American directors, Frank Capra, the film balances the story line ever so delicately, never making the Vanderhof/Sycamores seem too weird or bizarre but making them totally lovable as well. This is thanks in no small part to the acting, led by Jean Arthur in one of her most serious roles as well as the aforementioned Barrymore.James Stewart got his big break here and despite being underused, still is quite effective as the wide-eyed son who despite being born with a silver spoon in his mouth seems troubled about the way his family sees others. Edward Arnold is very good as the elder Kirby, always looking to make a deal but also gets some big news flashes in the process. This is a film that just makes you smile; some scenes more than others. But Capra knows how to use the emotional factor in his films and with great bravado, creates a stirring climax certain to put a smile on any viewer's face.The main lesson here, obviously, is to devote your life to do something you want to do, not just something you are able to. There is also the notion of young love and two very different families coming together. Here you can see the seeds of films like My Big Fat Greek Wedding and others of the type. But what Capra is able to diffuse into the story and into our hearts is something that will probably never be resurrected.",

            "review_title": "So many spoonfuls of syrupy sentiments it gets indigestible pretty fast...",
            "content": "\"You Can\"t Take It With You\", adapted from George S. Kaufman's play by Capra's long partner Frank Capra is one of my least favorite Best Picture winners. There, I said it!They say you shouldn't use negative sentences during a job interview; even if the intended effect is positive, \"I'm a doer\" is a wiser choice of words than \"I'm no quitter\" and somehow \"It's a Wonderful Life\" works far better than \"No Man is a Failure Who Has Friends\". So maybe that overlong, negative and preachy title cast a spell on my own appreciation.I enjoy a good Capra film like the next movie lover, there's just something in my heart left cold by an avalanche of good sentiments and interminable lectures about the value of money vs. Friends. There's a fine line between telling a moral story and moralizing the audience, which Capra crosses way too often, feeding the viewer with so many spoonfuls of syrup it gets indigestible pretty fast.The film opens with two families as opposed in values as the Montaigues and the Capulets: the Kirbys, a wealthy conservative family where being a businessman is an evidence from one male heir to another; the son, Tony (James Stewart) is already young Vice-President by the sole merit of being the son of Anthony (Edward Arnold). And the Vanderhorfs/ Carmichaels/Sycamores, a family where anarchy doesn't run but gallops on the horse of insanity and whose offspring Alice (Jean Arthur) works as a stenographer for the Kirbys and is incidentally Tony's sweetheart.Tony compares Alice's family to characters that could have emerged from the imagination of Walt Disney. I wish it could be Disney for they're closer in spirit to the Looney Tunes. And the grandfather and patriarch Martin Vanderhoff (Lionel Barrymore) is perhaps the wisest of all (which isn't saying much). His establishing moment consists of persuading a timid bank clerk (Donald Meek) whose hobby is to manufacture little toys, to quit his job and leave in his big house (how he figured he didn't have a family speaks volumes about his capabilities to read into people).I wish the family's portrayal could have lived up to that madness-with-a-heart spirit but, the Sycamores form such a nutty gallery it makes the patients of \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" feel like a Bergman cast. The mother, Penny (for some reason Oscar-nominated Spring Byinton), works on a play not out of passion but because she wanted to use a typewriter, her husband designs firecrackers in the cave, the little cousin (Ann Miller) keeps dancing so much it's a miracle there aren't blood spots all over the tapestry, her husband played by a young Dub Taylor plays xylophone, ... there is also some Russian dancer (Mischa Auer) who looks like a Rasputin after a haircut and the two Black helps whose seem to have been moderately infected by the whole environing nonsense.The so-called hymn to freedom invoked by Capra confines to sheer cacophony, which allows us at least to appreciate the true moments of genuine tenderness like when Martin talks about his wife to Alice. Lionel Barrymore is one of the best things about the film, with Edward Arnold who was born to play businessmen-like types. And the little scene with Alice allows us to understand why Martin doesn't want to sell the house hence preventing an important project to be built in a 12-block area of New York City, working against the interest of Mr. Kirby and his shareholders. It's a matter of sentimentality, not some rebellion against the system or against taxes that could have been used against Capra during the HUAC commission.Sentiments are as integral to Capra's appeal as horses in John Ford's movies. The romance between Stewart and Jean Arthur is touching and sweet but while Stewart does act his age (he was 29), Arthur looks way too mature and lacks a little sparkle of juvenile innocence. Or was it deliberate? Alice is perhaps the closest to a straight person, making her somewhat the 'black sheep' of the family, which means a tad more likable than the others.That's my beef with the film, what Capra basically asks us is to choose between a family that is way too hard to like and a family he tries too hard to make us like. The film went well for the most part but I kept feeling the psychological maneuvers here and there. One in particular annoyed me: in the scene where Mrs. Kirby (Mary Forbes) started to talk about her own hobbies, Penny dismissed them as 'ridiculous'. If anything, the Sycamores should embrace ridiculousness, so why so categorical? The reason is simple: the script wants us to dislike the Kirbys' but here's the Gordian knot of the film: one family can't be liked for ethical reasons, the other for practical ones.And while the edifice seems steady for two thirds of the film, everything stumbles in the third act when they all go to jail and Mr. Vanderhorf gets his bail paid by people, which is the Capraesque usual reward, and we know what comes next is the \"change of heart\" that will redeem father Kirby, after getting not one but two 'reasons-you-suck\" speeches. But even when the two old men start playing harmonicas, I kept thinking of that very death that occurs in the film, way too dramatic for the whole material.And growing tired of the whole 'let's all play and sing and wrestle' mess, I was thinking of that canceled project: wouldn't have it created more jobs and allowed people to improve their living? Money can't buy happiness but didn't it make Mr. Vanderhorf a free man? Despite some truly likable moments and an adorable James Stewart, this is just Capra's least subtle contribution.I guess this was the Great Depression and Capra's films were people's antidepressents, but you know what happens when you take too many pills at once?",

It's been said before that other superior Capra movies were less well rewarded than this one which unaccountably for me won the \"Best Director\" & \"Best Film\" Oscars of its year, this in a vintage year with \"The Adventures Of Robin Hood\" and \"Angels With Dirty Faces\" amongst the shouldn't-have-been runners up.Of course it's not without its charms, with the seniors leading the way in the acting stakes, especially Lionel Barrymore and Edward Arnold, followed by the always watchable James Stewart and Jean Arthur, both, like so many others on view, Capra perennials. Capra demonstrates his gift again for crowd scenes, choreographing his players skilfully, not easy when these include a careering Negro servant, forever pirouetting ballet dancer and old man Barrymore permanently on crutches. And yet I found this satire on greed had too much of the velvet glove about it and some of the serious scenes just too bleak when set in counterpoint to what has gone before. Never mind that Edward Arnold's \"Tammany Hall\" prototype AP Kirby drives an innocent man to an early death; within minutes he's leading the party in a jamboree by playing a mouth-organ duet with Barrymore to salve his conscience and get us to the predictable happy-ending.Certain scenes are redolent of other films, for example Stewart and Arthur's goofy dance in the park prompted by a bunch of what look like refugee kids from \"Our Town\" was reworked better in \"It's A Wonderful Life\", while the couple's embarrassing entrance and exit at a society dinner pales alongside Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn's hilarious doings in a similar scene in Hawks' \"Bringing Up Baby\". I've also just watched Preston Sturges' lesser known \"Christmas in July\" and got more sense of community there than I got here, and it plays a full 50 minutes less! I could also comment yet again on the subservient stereotypical roles doled out to the Negroes in the cast but this was par for the course I appreciate for many Hollywood films of this era. Enough, already; for me Capra is at his best when there's a dark undertow to his work, as in all four of his other films I mentioned earlier. Here the whimsy comes over as flimsy and no amount of amusing eccentricity on display can displace the feeling that this creaky old theatrical adaptation is now showing its age and doesn't belong in the vanguard of this great director's work.",

            "content": "Directed by Frank Capra, \"You Can't Take It with You\" won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1938. With a screenplay by Robert Riskin, based on a stage play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart, it involves two conflicting families: the wealthy Kirbys, the father of whom is a tough, no-nonsense banker and munitions tycoon, and the carefree Vanderhof/Sycamore family, a bunch of eccentrics who spend their days passionately imbibing on their own little childish whims. In his opening scene, the kind, lovable Grandpa Martin Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore) rescues Mr. Poppins (Donald Meek) from his dull day job and brings him to his wacky home so that he may spend his time doing what he loves to do the most. This becomes one of the central attitudes of the picture.Frank Capra was a genius when it came to casting. Grandpa Vanderhof is my favorite character in \"You Can't Take It with You,\" and who better to portray him than Lionel Barrymore? The sweet-natured Vanderhof is the most lovable and delightful character in the picture, always encouraging his family and friends to do the things that they really want to do, and believing that money should be spent on all things enjoyable since it cannot be taken with you when your time comes. (This is entirely opposite of Barrymore's Scrooge-like Mr. Potter character in Frank Capra's classic 1946 film \"It's a Wonderful Life.\") The heavyset Edward Arnold was perfect for the stern role of munitions industrialist Anthony P. Kirby. The super-wealthy, money-conscious Kirby learns from Vanderhof that there is more in life than business deals and that if he is not careful, he shall become a failure because of the eventual loss of all his friends. My favorite actor James Stewart, even though his role is not nearly as flashy as Barrymore's or Arnold's, seemed to be just right for the part of Mr. Kirby's son Tony. The shy, warmhearted innocence (and the light touch of humor) that Stewart brings to his role indicates that he was maturing as a young actor with only a few years of experience in Hollywood. Not to mention Jean Arthur as the friendly Alice Sycamore, Tony's secretary and perhaps the only \"sane\" member of Grandpa Vanderhof's clan; Mischa Auer as the pompous Russian choreographer Mr. Kolenkhov; Spring Byington as Grandpa's daughter Penny Sycamore, who writes plays that are never produced; Samuel S. Hinds as Penny's husband Paul, who spends his time in the basement with his friend Mr. DePinna (Halliwell Hobbes) lighting firecrackers; Ann Miller as ballerina Essie Sycamore, daughter of Penny & Paul and sister to Alice; Dub Taylor as Ed, the vibraphonist husband to Essie; Donald Meek as the eccentric toy maker Mr. Poppins; and the two fun-loving African-American servants of this wacky family, named Rheba (Lillian Yarbo) and Donald (Eddie Anderson).Here are my favorite highlights from \"You Can't Take It with You.\" During their first scene together in Tony's office, Tony tells Alice that he could always get what he wanted if he yelled loudly enough, and he gives her a sample. Vanderhof shares a quiet moment with granddaughter Alice before her date with Tony, and later on Vanderhof has a little fun with an IRS agent (Charles Lane) who tries to confront him about owing the government years and years of back income taxes. While sitting on a park bench during a quiet evening, Tony tells Alice of a solar energy experiment that he took on with a friend. At the posh restaurant, Tony comically describes an impending scream rushing from his feet up to his head; Alice is so frightened that it is she who does the screaming. An overwhelming mass of fireworks blows up prior to everyone getting arrested. At the jail, Vanderhof tries to console Mr. Kirby but soon loses his temper and confronts him about his accumulated wealth and power; later on in the courtroom, Alice very loudly confronts both Tony and Mrs. Kirby (Mary Forbes) for similar reasons, and chaos erupts as photographers invade the premises. Mr. Kirby's business competitor Mr. Ramsey (H. B. Warner) warns him that he will have a crackup if he's not careful, and shortly after that, Tony tells his dad that he wants no further part in his business ventures. And finally, the song \"Polly Wolly Doodle\" accompanies the final merrymaking at the Vanderhof home celebrating Mr. Kirby's reformation.One particular author wrote that nothing could be more tiresome than having to sit through \"You Can't Take It with You\" in its entirety, but I strongly disagree. As a screwball comedy it is wonderful, and its message is quite clear: enjoy your life to the fullest, and as long as you have friends, you will never be a failure. As if to prove the point, Grandpa Vanderhof says one line in the play that (regrettably) never made it in the film: \"Never take life seriously. No one's lived through it yet.\"",

Case in point: \"You Can't Take It With You.\" Certainly there are other equally antiquated films that retain their freshness. But comedy is an art form that notoriously \"dates\" almost before it is performed.Frank Capra captured some timeless and impressive moments from his timeless and impressive cast, here. Most especially the remarkable Lionel Barrymore \u2013 literally on his \"last legs\" from crippling arthritis. You'd never know it from his performance on crutches (conveniently excused in the film as a misadventurous slide down the banister in his home).More of Barrymore (the REAL actor: not the alcoholic eye-shadowed ham his brother John became) momentarily.Watch the initial scene with James Stewart and Jean Arthur. Their amazing line delivery makes every word seem spontaneous. Capra's direction is so innocently sexy as to be almost shocking! Locked in a romantic clench, Miss Arthur (as Stewart's secretary) attempts \u2013 and succeeds \u2013 at answering the phone with her teeth so as not to break the embrace. Though there may be double and even triple entendres underlying this brilliant bit of business (pure Capra), it plays like the innocent goodnight kiss on your first date \u2013 though in fact it's a proposal of marriage.Or watch Miss Arthur and Mr. Barrymore in the bedroom scene, where he reveals why he'll never sell this house, and she reveals how much she loves James Stewart's character. Watch how the scene is shot, in front of a mirror. You can only play this scene this way on film, not onstage. Watch these two consummate actors play grandfather and granddaughter with a sweetness and lilt and a lifetime of love that belies the fact that they barely knew each other as actors.Watch Edward Arnold's arc from arrogant financial tycoon to lost father. He seldom got to play a range like this (though if you get a chance, catch him in an old kinescope of \"Twelve Angry Men\" from \"Playhouse 90\" on television and marvel at how LITTLE really fine actors ever got a chance to do, on film.).Supporting players are uniformly perfect. Donald Meek's \"Poppins\" is the embodiment of the playful, creative child who lives in all of us, finally released from the drudgery of an anonymous 9-to-5 job. Mischa Auer, Samuel S. Hinds, H.B. Warner, Spring Byington, Ann Miller, Dub Taylor, Mary Forbes, Eddie Anderson and Lillian Yarbro (as the Sycamore's black servants \u2013 and if you think white character actors were and are ill-served in films, think about the situation in which black actors found and find themselves) \u2013 all are superlative. \"There are no small parts,\" goes the old theatrical chestnut, \"only small actors.\" Not a small actor in the bunch, here.Towering above them all, even on crutches, even soon to be forced to play roles in a wheelchair because of his arthritis, is Lionel Barrymore. While his brother John, \"The Profile,\" may have been, and be, more famous, it is Lionel who is the better actor for the ages. Lionel eschewed \"stardom\" for talent. He submerged himself into every role, unlike John, who made every role \"serve\" his erstwhile star status.Compare Barrymore's playing here, on crutches, yet!, with his portrayal of Kringelein in \"Grand Hotel\" a mere six years earlier. Nothing about these two characters is remotely similar. Except their humanity. Watch Barrymore's desperation in \"Grand Hotel,\" as a man who knows he is dying and grasping at whatever is left of life's bounty and goodness . . . (his all-but-silent \"drunk\" scene alone in his hotel room is virtually an exercise in pantomime to rival Marcel Marceau) . . . and contrast his playing here, as Grandpa Vanderhof, who has lived and survived his beloved wife's death and his decision to leave the rat-race with easy gusto, ready humor and sheer delight at the human condition.Or contrast his thoroughly detestable \"Mr. Potter\" in Capra's \"It's a Wonderful Life\" eight years later, and confined to a wheelchair.THIS Barrymore played roles long after his younger brother, John, died of alcoholism and stardom.Not to slight James Stewart and Jean Arthur. Their scenes together are magic.So is \"It's A Wonderful Life,\" which weaves a spell that still captivates long after all its participants have left us. In this case, left us laughing, loving and longing for the days when actors and films were powerful enough to last for decades and make a mockery of Time.What? You think \"Basic Instinct\" or Spielberg's \"War of the Worlds\" will be required viewing in 70 years?--",

The other lives in relative poverty and spends his life creating moments of personal happiness. This film unnecessarily places the two men in opposition, but it's an expected construct given the common belief that the two viewpoints are mutually exclusive and constantly at battle.Edward Arnold is banker Anthony P. Kirby. He plays Kirby with a veneer of gruffness that allows viewers to see the man beneath. His performance is a kindness that adds nuance and complexity to the man whose world is about to be challenged. Lionel Barrymore is Martin Venderhof, a man who has assembled an enclave of artists and dreamers around himself because he believes that love is the greatest currency. Barrymore's performance is also nuanced. The script allows both men to occupy their universes without an excess of speechmaking or exaggerating.Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur are the star-crossed lovers at the nexus of the two disparate families. They truly seem to be in love and they keep the focus on their relationship. Though the script may be a little sloppy at times, the story itself is the driving force in this film, not to be overshadowed by any one character.Capra directs with an eye to magnifying the common man and, once again, accomplishes his task. It would be difficult to argue against the film's Oscar wins for Best Picture and Best Director in 1938.",

The play of YCTIWY was marvelous. I loved the script so much that I, a very shy person, auditioned for my local theatre guild's production of it. (I was cast as Rheba.)I rented to movie and what I saw disturbed me. With the exception of the scenes lifted line for line from the play, the rest was unrecognizable. Why the subplot about the land purchase? Why the gradiose \"commercial\" for \"goodness?\" A smart, snappy play with its wonderful and uplifting message about the wonders of being oneself became a sticky bowl of treacle. Did they think the American public wouldn't \"get it?\" It was sad to see such a first rate cast in a second rate version of something that was excellent to being with. (Speaking of cast -- I guess this movie put a lot of folks to work in the 1930s. The play had a fairly large cast for a straight play to begin with, but the production company seemed to have more than quadrupled it!)",

            "content": "You Can't Take It With You (1938) :\nBrief Review -Genius Frank Capra teaches new meaning of Life in this Entertaining Classic. 'Life Is Beautiful', well i am not talking about Italian film this time but I'm saying it genuinely. Life Is Beautiful but we just need to see it deep and of course from different perspective. Frank Capra chose this topic from the stage drama and delivered a life-changing entertaining film for all generations. You only live once in this life and if you don't have fun then you haven't actually lived it so have fun not money. Because when you will feel alone in this world you will need friends not Money. Genius Frank Capra just delivered couple of life lessons through this film. You Can't Take It With you is maybe the most thought provoking and positive film came out in 30s along with several other classics but what makes this one special is humanly point of view and not cinematic one. There's a love story which isn't explored much and thank god it wasn't or else the main content would have been overshadowed. Now you know why i call Mr. Capra a Genius, he knows what to explore and what to not. More than a Love story it's a story of ordinary people, story of a family, story of free spirited people and that's the most lovable thing. James Stewart, Jean Arthur makes a good pair but the film shines because of Lionel Barrymore & Edward Arnold's amazing acts. There were couple of things which could have been repaired to make it a Perfect film but as they say, a Perfect film never exists. It is about being close to Perfect and this one is close to it. Frank Capra entertains but also he tells a new meaning of life with strong narrative and extrafascicular characterisation of the cast to add another Timeless film in his legendary Filmography. This was the film to win Best Director Award for Frank Capra and his last to win Best Picture too. Coincidence doesn't happen with ordinary things, this is something more subtle than it looks. You Can't Take It With You surely deserves higher reputation among movie buffs.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

He wants to marry her but she lives with her VERY eccentric, poor but loving family headed by her grandfather (Lionel Barrymore). Stewart's parents do not allow him to marry her...and Arnold is trying to run them out of their house.I never saw the play this based on, but the movie is wonderful! Barrymore is in top form as a warm, lovable man (a totally different character from what he played in \"It's a Wonderful Life\" 7 years later), Arthur is fresh and appealing and Arnold is very good too. Also Spring Byington and Ann Miller are good in supporting roles. Surprisingly Stewart is just so-so--he seems uncomfortable.The plot itself is old (rich vs. poor) but the screenplay is great and the cast give it their all. Barrymore telling Arnold off in a jail cell is a highlight. The only debit here is the last half hour--the laughs stop, the film becomes quite dark and it gets too preachy. Still it has a happy ending (totally unbelievable but I loved it). This deservedly won Best Picture and Best Director of its year. I give it a 10!",

            "content": "You Can't Take it With You (1938)Screwball Madcap Hilarious Insanity to a TeeNot only is this an archetypal screwball comedy, where love goes wrong in all the wrong ways, and goes right by the end (of course), but it includes a cast of total nutjob characters. That is, the format is pure insanity the way Bringing Up Baby is insanity, but this isn't a clash of fairly normal types, here, but a celebration of delightful loonies. Yes, it can be ridiculous and a bit predictable, but that's the format of this kind of film. It's not the destination, but the journey.It goes without saying on a journey like this there isn't a calm moment. And good thing! In fact, the non-stop fireworks (literally and metaphorically) as well as the requisite Frank Capra \"feel good about being an American\" aura make this a really heartwarming movie, too. The bad guys aren't bad, the good guys get what they want, and along the way is a series of classic conflicts and confusions. Capra is a terrific thinking director, whatever his fuzzy sentiments, and he leads the viewer with cinematic sophistication, so we anticipate certain turns of plot and love them when they occur--the harmonica being a symbolic and obvious example.There is certainly an overt message behind all this--money can't buy love--but there are lots of smaller built-in aspects like the notion of community triumphing when people stick together (repeated in It's a Wonderful Life, which has several echos of this earlier movie). Or the idea that the meek inherit the earth--Jimmy Stewart being hopeless meek in the face of his father's corporate giddiness, and the terrific \"regular girl\" Jean Arthur a prototypical strong but humble woman.So--watch for clever and fast writing, for great (and not always hammy) acting by the four or five main characters that holds together even in its exaggerations, and for fast editing. But also watch how well filmed the movie is, both sets and camera-work. Capra was brilliant at squeezing every square inch of space out of a scene, but without drawing attention to itself (at least not until Arsenic and Old Lace, when it is part of the point to be self- referential). Even the busy, layered up sound is pushing boundaries for the time.Lionel Barrymore, the main character (in case I seem to have forgotten him) is as lovable and admirable as he is hate-able in Wonderful Life. Note how his disability, apparently from a fall in 1936 (and so not a factor in an early classic like Dinner at Eight), is incorporated into the plot. He was such a transcendent actor, directors like Capra built movies around him. Great movies.",

While Frank Capra, Jimmy Stewart, and Lionel Barrymore later had more famous collaborations, they also work well as a team in this picture. It must have been especially satisfying for viewers in the Depression, and it's still worthwhile now.The story makes good use of the set-up between Jean Arthur's family of eccentrics and Stewart's stodgy upper-class parents. Barrymore is believable and entertaining as the head of his household, and the house full of oddballs contains a lot of talent as well, with Spring Byington, Ann Miller, Mischa Auer and the rest all getting some good moments and some opportunities to use their talents. Some of the best sequences come when their characters are simply being themselves. Edward Arnold also adds a lot as Stewart's powerful father.Capra puts it all together nicely, and makes the story work even when the developments strain credibility. Although the movie has a clear message, all of the characters are treated sympathetically, which is not an easy task. This type of innocently upbeat feature is not appreciated now as much as it once was, but that's just a whim of current fashion that will end someday. \"You Can't Take It With You\" still holds up quite well for what it sets out to do.",

            "content": "This is a very uneven movie. There is a lot of filler, a lot that just isn't that funny or interesting.But when it reaches its stride, in the last part of the picture, there are some remarkable scenes, in part because of Capra's direction, in part because he had assembled a cast capable of very good acting.The courtroom scene, for example, where we first see Mr. Kirby begin to question his own life, has a whole series of great touches. Harry Davenport, as the judge, is one of them, foreshadowing Harry Carry's great turn as the president of the Senate in *Mr. Smith Goes to Washington*, which Capra would direct the next year.In fact, from this point on, the movie is about Mr. Kirby's slow realization that he has made a mess of his life. Today, that could all be done in one unconvincing scene. Here, Capra lets us watch the great actor Edward Arnold slowly come to the realization that his financially very successful life is hollow. When he finally begs Lionel Barrymore for help, we can see that he is a broken man, and it's deeply moving because Arnold plays it so well, and because Capra directs his scenes so quietly and with such understatement.Yes, there is a lot of excess here, especially with the Vanderhof family. They are too crazy. But there is also a lot of fine, understated acting here, brought out by Capra at his best. This is not a movie to be dismissed, as some previous reviewers have claimed. It is certainly not perfect. There are certainly slow spots in it. But at its best, it is a very fine movie.",

Capra's films often deal a lot with the essence of community and family that trumps all. This film does just that and does it to perfection.It stars James Stewart but the entire cast is incredible. Stewart is very young and in the early stages of his career so the rest of the actors really nail each and every scene they are in. In particular, Lionel Barrymore has about as good as of a performance you can have and the entire Vanderhof family gets their time to shine. Much like It's a Wonderful Life, this film is not only very enjoyable, but it's highly re-watchable. Capra does a great job of directing his actors to some of their best performances of their career, along with creating a unique household full of what is probably one of my favorite families in film history. Everyone loves the Vanderhof's, and so do I.The film is very light hearted and I can understand if people think it could be corny, much like It's a Wonderful Life, but I don't think there's anything wrong with having a story that everyone can enjoy. It's the classic tale of Romeo and Juliet/Cinderella but it's told and structured in a unique way that really hits home. It's a predictable but really sweet script that plays out just that way on screen.

Sadly, we can't always do what we want and it isn't cowardice when we don't. I don't find Kirby's final actions to be in character and there's not enough to explain the character arch. The country was still recovering from the Great Depression when this was released and it is vulgar to not care at all about material well being at that time. But that is mostly quibbles. The cast is charming, funny and oh so endearing. Grandpa is easily Barrymore's career role and Stewart does a great job of splitting the difference between his parents and the Vanderhof clan. Likewise, the script is filled with deft touches, witty zingers and a ton of pathos.I was struck today how much deeper this film is than a mere comedy of manners. It is about class, your aim in life and what means to be alive. This is a piece of entertainment that is also trying to say something. It is great.",

But this one ranks above them all. Why? Because I love the feel, the message, the theme inherent in the plot. Put very simply, it is this: life is too short to waste it in the pursuit of wealth, which ultimately brings no happiness. It makes infinitely more sense to spend it bringing joy into your own life, and the lives of those around you. Why, you might ask, do you need to spend over two hours watching a movie just to hear this idea reiterated? Because, I would answer, the journey, from the opening scenes of a day in the life of a wealthy Wall Street banker to the final scene of saying grace before supper, is just so much fun - good, clean, heartwarming fun, at that. Also, there is the not inconsiderable merit of Mr. Lionel Barrymore playing the harmonica and railing against the \"isms\" of the world.Under Capra's expert direction, a mix of acting talents so perfect the cast must have been blessed from above, comes together to create one of the most down-to-earth, enjoyable, and hilarious screwball comedies of all time. Oh, but be warned: the firecrackers do tend to go off with a real bang from time to time.It's the story of Alice Sycamore, a relatively normal young woman - normal considering she comes from an offbeat clan of free spirits, including her grandfather Martin Vanderhof, her aspiring playwright mother Penny, and one old gentleman who came to deliver the ice one day and never left. She's a secretary for the son of banking magnate Anthony P. Kirby, and she falls in love with the boss's son - or rather, with the back of his head, as she tells him herself. But the horribly sane, dull world of Anthony Kirby, Jr. isn't so well-suited to the topsy-turvy, go-with-the-flow lifestyle adopted by Alice's family. The rest of the film deals with the juxtaposition of the two very different ideals and lifestyles, and whether or not Alice and Tony can find happiness together.Some ridicule this film as an over-the-top fantasy slamming work ethic and responsibility, and making the rich look like poor fools. While it's true that life can't always be as simple and beautiful as it is for the fictional Vanderhof family, it's a gentle reminder of what's really important in life, and how we need to take the time to live in the moment, sometimes even with joyous abandon, and never forget to have some fun.Consider the fictional Vanderhof family this way: each person seen as a unique individual; free to do whatever it is they want to do most; never overlooked; never judged; but always loved. I like to think that almost every person secretly, somewhere deep down inside, would want to live that way. I know I would.",

What makes it considerably less simple is the cast of wacky characters that live with the old man. This quirky bunch of individuals are something that I can't imagine ever seeing in the real world. In fact, they are almost so over-the-top that they don't make sense in a movie, particularly when they all break into insane dancing and song. It's like something out of a spoof comedy rather than anything realistic.It took some time for me to buy into You Can't Take It With You. I was so put off by the unusual characters, and their insane shenanigans that I was questioning whether Capra would ever sell me on a grounded story. I think it took them delving into the star-crossed romance a little deeper before I got invested in the plot. There are some good moments particularly when the 2 families have to deal with each other, since they are such polar opposites. It made me think of The Birdcage if there was no attempt at deception about who everyone was in reality. The humor doesn't always work for me (probably because I wasn't fully buying into the odd family,) but I still laughed on occasion. You Can't Take It With You is certainly entertaining, and perhaps all it would take is for me to be in a better state of mind to truly love it, but I still found it worthwhile.",

That's the formula that Kaufman and Hart employ so engagingly (if rather superficially), in this fairy tale advocation of anarchy, so superbly acted by Barrymore and Arnold we tend to accept all the moralizing at face value and occasionally believe it's true. All the same, there's maybe a bit too much of the cracker-barrel philosophizing and occasionally we are unintentionally reminded by long stretches of dialogue that what we are actually watching was originally a stage play. Despite these strictures, it's still a rewarding and entertaining movie, produced on a grand budget (around $1.65 million \u2013 a staggering amount for Columbia), appealingly acted and characterized \u2014 and absolutely must viewing for Jean Arthur fans who'll be pleased to find their idol so brightly and attractively photographed (especially in her close-ups).What is surprising, however, on a recent viewing of Sony's splendid DVD, is how hollow the characters actually are. Vanderhof continually passes himself off as a good guy, yet actually he has a cruel, mean streak. Notice the way he treats Charles Lane's IRS man who is simply following up two or three letters to Vanderhof which the old man didn't even bother to open, let alone read. He flays Lane unmercifully, and having driven him out of the house, he then claims that he did in fact pay his income tax, \"every cent of it.\" Tony Kirby, also cast in the heroic mold, is equally repulsive, as the whole plot centers on a particularly mean, selfish and utterly stupid trick that he plays on every single member of the cast (except, of course, himself). Other characters, described in the synopsis as \"good natured\" such as the heroine's dad and her sister's husband are equally selfish, thoughtless and irresponsible. In fact, of all the principal characters, only Jean Arthur's Alice emerges with any credit. (I almost gave a tick to Edward Arnold. His utterly ruthless arms profiteer has been considerably cleaned up for the movie, but he's still hideously repulsive as the brief scene with H.B. Warner amply demonstrates. I wonder why Capra left that very brief encounter in the film? Maybe he thought Arnold was making the character too sympathetic?)",

            "content": "A critique of the film; You Can't Take It With You could start with the character Poppins ( wonderfully played by Donald Meek) who is the culminated end product of The Wealth of Nations originally initiated by the celebrated Scottish philosopher Adam Smith. (B. 16 June 1723 \u0096 D.17 July 1790) That is the capitalist's Utopia of the spread of wealth. When this wealth spreads, its gravitational pull ends with a man performing a mundane task for a pay cheque that ties him there. Ironically, Poppins is counting the wealth of his rich, miserly boss. As such Poppins is the extrapolation of Charles Dickens' Scrooge's hand found in the Auther's classic, Christmas Carol fable.This causes Poppins to rebel against his mundane life by creating innovative toys in his spare time. The problem is such innovation and creativity are hampered from reaching their full potential by his miserable job, which he feels he must do to pay the bills. That is until Grandpa turns up and (Lionel Barrymore) shows him the light.Grandpa invites Poppins to live with him and his family who are living the 'utopian' dream, full of creative bohemians. All are really a bunch of 'freeloaders' dependent on Grandpa. Likewise, Grandpa is dependent on his tenants who rent properties on his estate, for his income. Therefore Grandpa is similar to his nemeses Anthony P. Kirby (Edward Arnald). The difference lies in how their wealth is spread and the purposes it is used for. Where the latter wants to use his to accumulate more wealth, the former wants his to live a bohemian lifestyle in a type of pre-hippie era commune.Apart from these differences, Grandpa and Kirby both like power of sorts. Where Kirby gains his through the accumulation of wealth, Grandpa gains his through utilising his charisma and the propagation of his ideals. The mens' differences lead to a confrontation where one tries to undermine the other with their own specialised brand of power, one being charm, the other money.The power that winds up winning is Grandpa's as his is sentimental and appealing, and none threatening in an obvious way. It is further irony that Grandpa rejects the power of Bolchavic communism, Italian fascism and Amercan capitalism only to have amassed such power himself. But Grandpa's power is that of humanity, which prevails and triumphs in a predictive ending.This film could have influence Orsen Welles' Citizen Cain (1941) as it deals with the detachment from reality and humanity that obscene wealth brings. Nevertheless the film is quintessentially Capra. Its sentimental persona belies its more complex multi-layered story of power, corruption, humanity, greed and value systems.Overall You Can't Take It With You is deeply political which makes it controversial. Nevertheless, this is a great film, with a great scrip, production, direction and acting from a brilliant cast.",

            "content": "I've seen a lot of praise for this movie and assumed it would be good; after all, I love James Stewart, I love romantic comedies, everyone else seems to love it, so how can it possibly go wrong? It can. It did. I had to force myself to sit through the entire movie, hoping it would get better. The message of the story is something akin to the more commonly known \"A Christmas Carol\". Unfortunately, where \"A Christmas Carol\" was an easily enjoyable read with a moral to it, this movie was a moral forced into the form of a romantic comedy. What it lacked in subtlety must have been made up for in something, but I can't exactly imagine it was the comedy or the romance.Where I should have loathed Kirby parents, I found myself feeling pity for the most part. The story at parts was so blatantly one-sided... even though Alice Sycamore's entire family enjoyed themselves and did only what they wanted (to a such a degree that was even illegal), there was no real consequence and no real lesson on their part learned. They may have been, in part, in the wrong, but they're still not in the wrong. This makes no sense, but whatever. It's not meant to make sense, it's comedy - so goes the excuse. The house should have burnt down when the fireworks in the basement went off, there should have been a more extreme fine and the revolutionary pamphlets were completely forgotten about after the single mention.Kirby Sr. eventually does make a bit of a change because of the ordeal he goes through (and in my opinion it was an ordeal. For me if not for him!), but there is no real change to Alice's family (whom I spent most of the movie wishing would end up in jail if not for their illegal activities, then for their unwarranted obnoxiousness). It was good to see the older Kirbys end up in jail, but the whole manner of it and the way things went made me feel very sorry for Mr. Kirby even as the moral of the story was repeatedly being thrown about by the dialog. Okay, we get it... rich, selfish, stuck up banker will die friendless and alone if he doesn't change - got it, can we move on yet? Apparently not.The comedic parts were more obnoxious than humorous, or was of such a humor I couldn't enjoy it even for the romantic parts, which I actually felt were decent.Overall, the sense of humor wasn't great, the \"villains\" weren't anything to be awed about (honestly, even in comedy I don't want to be caught dead feeling sorry for a villain), and there was a lack of reality that even comedy can't cure. As a comedy, it might fly for a lot of people, but to me it's a near total failure.Recommended for: people who can ignore reality and absolutely hate rich bankers so much they willingly side with eccentric old men who refuse point-blank to pay taxes. If you can get past those things, which I could not and shouldn't be forced to, then go ahead, by all means... maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did. Maybe.Rating: 3 out of 10 because that's about as much enjoyment as I got out of it (though that's me being generous, I'm afraid, it was more like a 2 out of 10, but the popcorn was good...).",

Kirby, is a kind of revelation in his role. You can see the transformation in his face as he realizes--finally--what a farce his life has been.I may be overstating this film's effectiveness, but it may not be a stretch to say it can change someone's life if they watch and truly pay attention to its message.

George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's Pulitzer Prize-winning play gets the Frank Capra treatment, meaning that the early comedic scenes are great fun while the third act is weighed down with lessons-to-be-learned. Jean Arthur and James Stewart are a whimsically off-center pair of young lovers whose fuzzy, low-keyed chit-chat bubbles with comfortable chemistry. Even better are Arthur's devil-may-care relatives: Ann Miller as her ballet-minded sister, Dub Taylor as her xylophone-playing brother-in-law, Spring Byington as her fanciful mother, and Lionel Barrymore, wonderful as her grandparent (on crutches).

She was up for best supporting actress but to lost to Fay Bainter for \"Jezebel.\" Edward Arnold and Lionel Barrymore should have easily been considered for best supporting actor, the latter as the unconventional head of a dysfunctional,zany family and the former as the definition of Mr. Capitalism.The picture provides non-stop hysterics as the Vanderhoff family comes into view. It turns much more serious after the hysterical scene where everyone is carted off to jail. In the following mayhem, we see the distinction between rich and poor in the cells as Arnold and his wife, fabulously played, by Mary Forbes,seems to only have contempt for the impoverished jailbirds.How Arnold eventually comes to his senses is marvelously depicted.

            "review_title": "It's Truly a Wonderful Life",
            "content": "You Can't Take It With You follows the Sycamore/Vandrerhof household; the ultimate eccentric family. In fact eccentric probably isn't the right word, they're complete nuts. They live a counter-cultural lifestyle of not working or paying taxes (and somehow getting away with it) and doing whatever makes them happy without a care in the world; people who aren't afraid to live. There are like cartoon characters who can twist their way out of any situation with people more in tune with reality, such as when Grandpa Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore) manages to convince the timid Mr. Poppins (Donald Meek) to stop throwing his life away working as a bureaucrat and start having fun. The Sycamores/Vanderhofs are families we probably can't be in real life but wish we could.Even with a large ensemble cast, Lionel Barrymore is the actor at the heart of the film in a role which is the polar opposite of his part of Henry F. Potter in Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life. The scene in which Vanderhof is confronted by a government official played by the always miserable looking Charles Lane feels like a dig at big government. When Grandpa asks the official what the government gives him for his money he is given the response of \"The government gives you everything\", emphases on the word everything, followed by Vanderhof's humorous but thought-provoking rebuttals. The family's refusal to pay taxes may be ethically questionable but it's a movie fantasy and could never happen in real life. Don't you wish you could deal with bureaucracies as easily as Grandpa Vanderhof?One of Grandpa Vanderhof's other fascinating moments is his monologue on \"ismmania\" although I'm quite sure what to make of it (\"when things go a little bad nowadays you go out and get yourself an 'ism' and you're in business\"). The message feels similar to a 1948 animated short \"Make Mine Freedom\" in how the danger of isms can cripple the people. All we need is our Americanism as Vanderhof proclaims, which itself is an ism but I digress. Regardless his line which following this, \"Lincoln said, with malice toward none, with charity to all - Nowadays they say think the way I do or I'll bomb the daylights out of you\"; that gives me chill every time.One the sweetest, most heartwarming scenes in any film ever is when Grandpa Vanderhof tells Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur) about his love for his deceased wife and how the room still smells of her perfume. Ugh, it just kills my poor little soul; a perfect display of Capra's gift for directing very intimate, emotional scenes in which the rest of the world ceases to exist. Likewise, there doesn't seem to be any actress whom James Stewart didn't share a great dynamic together. James Stewart and Jean Arthur share a perfect chemistry together, pairing the embodiment of the everyman and the embodiment of the everywoman.Non-conformity is the name of the game in You Can't Take It With You. Grandpa Vanderhof understands the preciousness of life as he pursues his own interests and his own forms of fulfillment. He encourages others to follow their dreams and not submit to the will of others. In one scene Alice speaks of Grandpa's thoughts on how \"most people are run by fear, the fear of what they eat, fear of what they drink, fear of their jobs, their future, their health, scared to save money and to spend it. People who commercialise on fear scare you to death to sell you something you don't need\". Amen sister! - The only thing to fear is fear itself.You Can't Take It With You promotes what we would now refer to as a libertarian mindset, live and let live as long as you're not hurting anyone. As Tony Kirby (James Stewart) tells his father Antony P. Kirby (Edward Arnold) towards the end of the film, \"I think this business is great. It's good for you because you like it. I don't, and I never will\". In many ways the Sycamore/Vandrerhof family is the embodiment of the American Dream. They own their property, each member pursues their individual dreams and they are above all happy. They live their life without inference from the government or other such bodies: Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.One of the other messages derived from You Can't Take It With You is the same as that to come from the ending of It's a Wonderful Life in which the townspeople come to George Bailey's aid, giving him money so he won't have to do jail time followed by the final message from the angel Clarence; \"No man is a failure who has friends\". A very similar incident occurs in YCTIWY in which friends and neighbors of the Sycamores pay for their fine in night court so they won't be locked up. Likewise, the family's arrest for being mistakenly identified as communists feels like a foreshadowing to McCarthyism. Then again they should have thought that a fireworks show based on the Russian Revolution as well as advertising it perhaps isn't the greatest idea; it stinks!There are those who will hear the name Frank Capra and have a reaction along the lines of \"Oh Frank Capra, sentimental, saccharine, manipulative rubbish\". I don't make apologies when I say that dismissing a film for being sentimental is the nonsense film criticism to end all nonsense criticisms; it stinks! Newsflash, stories have been manipulating people's emotions since the dawn of time. Pulling of effective sentimentality is a skill and I have not come across a single good reason as to why it is a problem. You Can't Take It With You is Capra at his most sentimental, manipulative, saccharine and all those other dirty words and I love it for that. So if that's the crime of the century, then lock me up for life. Capra-corn and proud of it!",

But if you watch You Can't Take It With You with fresh eyes, what seems to come across is weird capitalist propaganda.The message seems to be: it's okay that some people have ALL the money, because they're not really happy. And it's okay that the average family is getting screwed over, because... well, they know how to dance, and play the harmonica. (And the slaves really didn't mind picking cotton twelve hours a day, because they got to sing those great Spirituals. Yeah, right.) Sandwiched in between the Great Depression and World War II, that sort of message seems particularly evil. \"First, we swindled you out of your life's savings, now we're going to send you off to die for us. But it's okay, because, heck, we're not really happy about it.\"I can't believe that's what Capra meant to say. But that's what came out.On a story level, too, there are some really ugly messages. In a film like Mr Smith Goes to Washington, for example, the Everyman character fights like hell and manages to win one small point of justice. In You Can't Take It With You, the big, fat rich bastard MIGHT not knock the poor family's house down, depending on his mood... but either way, there's nothing they can do about it. If only this dismal view were presented with irony! Instead, we're apparently meant to cheer for these beaten people, no longer capable even of facing reality.Think how different the Sycamore family would have been had a Mr Smith lived there: letter writing campaigns, protests, picketing... membership in the communist party... Whoa; that can't be right! Hmmm... maybe it was exactly that inevitable conclusion that prevented Capra from following through his own logic. In Mr Smith Goes to Washington, the villains have committed several heinous crimes; in You Can't Take It With You, the property developer is operating quite legally. Mr Smith wins out by reaffirming the inherent rightness of the system; in the case of the Sycamore family, only overturning the capitalist system would help. Fortunately, we're spared that unsettling revelation, because, conveniently, the big, heartless property developer actually has a heart of gold. See? The system works! (Unfortunately, it's the feudal system.)You Can't Take It With You has many entertaining moments, and nice performances by some of Hollywood's most wonderful stars...

In the case of You Can't Take It With You which I watched for the first time last night as part of a Frank Capra season I found myself divided even as it unspooled. On the one hand I was prepared to succumb to its charm, applaud the eccentric family at its centre, led by Lionel Barrymore and boo their natural enemy, ruthless capitalist Edward Arnold, but even as it became obvious that Arnold was going to develop into a latter-day Scrooge, and join the metaphorical 'workers', my practical mind was saying that bankers just don't become bums in the real world however much we would like them to. It was more than interesting to watch with hindsight Lionel Barrymore opposing big business with the knowledge that ten years later in yet another Capra film he, Barrymore, would play a character (Potter) that made Edward Arnold seem more like Bob Cratchit than Scrooge.

The movie is an unofficial prequel to It's a Wonderful Life, i felt. Lionel Barrymore has given a performance that will be remembered by every movie buff.The son of a banker falls in love with his secretary, who hails from an eccentric family. I wondered how on earth would they would be a couple, considering the weird people in her family who are insouciant. They have no steady income, don't pay their taxes and make explosives without a license. Tony loves Alice for what she is and gets along with her family for being unique.Tony brings his parents to Alice's place and the Kirbys couldn't have been more terrified. When a police raid results in the accidental explosion of explosives, all the Sycamores and Kirbys are sent to the prison. Anthony Kirby disparages the lower and the middle classes much to infuriate Vanderhof. Vanderhof tells money doesn't matter when you have no friends who would lend a hand at the time of crisis. He also says \"You can't take the money with you\" when you die but you'll leave with the memories and the people who have made your life worth it.Alice leaves the town to stay away from Tony and her pompous snob mother. When the Wall Street collapses, Anthony's counterpart loses his trade and dies with a heart attack after enlightening Anthony that money doesn't matter in life. Tony pulls his father out of the living oblivion by offering his resignation as the vice-president to lead a more moral and ethical life with people around. Anthony cancels the biggest deal that could skyrocket his bank and goes to meet the Sycamores who are about to vacate their house and apologizes for being rude. He realizes how many helping hands the so-called \"eccentric middle class family\" had at the time of vacating their house for their harmony and friendship with the people of the remaining blocks. He turns a new leaf.The Kirbys and Sycamores merge into one single entity.The movie was surely a laughter riot. I love the scene in which Mr.Vandehof rejoinders to the questions put by the man from Revenue department. This movie will remain the one close to my heart for a long time.",

I read something about him and I discovered this is a typical Capra's film once it's `funny, well produced, has a great cast and is enchanting'. Now I know I must go and look for more of his movies, and I'll do it!A young man (Stewart) falls in love with a beautiful girl and they set their parents meeting in her house. Her family is made of eccentrics: her father gave up everything in order to enjoy life, her mother writes plays, her sister dances in the middle of the room while she's assisted by a funny Hungarian teacher and her husband plays the music. They have a bunch of employees in their house who make fireworks in the cellar without any license. There's no necessity to say the young man's parents can't believe their eyes when they get there and witness all those scenes.\nCapra's way of showing all these facts is great. Everything is shown in such a pure and innocent way, that it's impossible to not have a good time while we watch `You Can't It With You'. The highly talented cast is also important in your enjoyment. Although the way of telling the story may seem innocent, there's a lot behind it. Capra was really worried about giving us a little more than just fun. There' a beautiful message in all those apparent madness, once the movie is about making friends and making good to other people, not only spending the time just thinking about financial success. That's the treasure the movie hides. I'm sure I didn't spoil the surprises, because you discover them as the story goes on. My rate 9/10",

It's generally considered that the award didn't mean much until the following year with Gone With The Wind, with It Happened One Night as an exception example. Capra was the president of the Academy and all. Nevertheless, You Can't Take It With You is a solid film, one that doesn't get great until the second half. It's bogged down by its stage obligations. The first forty minutes are incredibly unfocused, following plot threads that have no intention of going anywhere and its contrived eccentric family stick out like a sore thumb. Naturally, nothing about it is organic. But it owns its classical themes of greed and generational pressures like it doesn't exist in any other film. However, its best moment was later topped in the exact same way in It's A Wonderful Life's climax, which explains how it didn't have a shot at a Picture win. It's sentimental, with no sense of what makes for good visuals, but it's likable. That's Capra for you.7/10",

Hinds, H.B. Warner, Dub Taylor (in his screen debut), Spring Byington). Stubborn Grandpa Vanderhof (Barrymore) refuses to sell his home to bank magnate Anthony Kirby (Morgan), who plans to build a munitions plant over the land; affable Anthony Jr. (James Stewart) is in love with Vanderhof's granddaughter Alice (Jean Arthur) over the objections of his class-conscious mother. Eager to please his potential in-laws and placate his airless folks, Stewart convinces Alice to host a dinner at her home to acquaint the wildly disparate families\u2014let the fireworks begin\u0085 Vanderhof's home is an oasis of sorts to a collection of eccentrics, some blood-related, who, tired of the daily grind, lead guiltless lives of blithe creativity and freedom of movement, nurtured by the patriarch's simple code: treat your neighbor well and do what you want. He's emblematic of utilitarian themes Capra will endorse again and again, and in him, Capra finds an endearing rebel who defies the notion that men must lead lives of \"quiet desperation,\" giving timid, powerless sorts like Poppins (fittingly named Donald Meek) freedom from thankless toil. The great scenes of the multi-functional Vanderhof living room aglow with activity from all corners of the frame are simply and masterfully staged in long shots that give the impression of tiny particles of energy joyously unbound, zipping around a defined space. Here on, Capra will become more restrictive with his camera set-ups. The scope narrows in, for example, on one perfect shot in which the Vanderhofs and Kirbys are locked in a prison cell together after a hilarious night of intense culture-clashing and miscalculation, as the elder Kirby dumps a barely lit cigar in the direction of a hypnotized row of inmates who dutifully pile onto the ground to claw away at the prize. Although Capra will eventually say much more, here he indelibly expresses a troubling social imbalance that the remainder of the picture will earnestly attempt to rectify. It's a paradigmatic moment for a director not usually associated with evocative displays of visual rhetoric.",

I can't believe this won Best Picture, let alone being held up as a classic still today.Edward Arnold's moral reversal is telegraphed so far in advance you swat your forehead in amazement at how unsophisticated audiences must have been back then. And then his old rival literally haunting him before closing the big deal? And then the guy dies! The perpetuation of \"money can't buy happiness\" is so tritely bludgeoned into our heads (the audience) you wonder whether there was ever any room for nuance.I really enjoyed the way this movie starts. In fact, I thought I was waiting for another Hollywood screwball classic, only with a little more heart and a little less slapstick to go around. Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur are a total delight, their chemistry is absolutely authentic and invigorating. It's when old man Barrymore keeps peppering this over-salted ham of a movie with his optimism and joie de vivre that you want to jam a fork in a toaster just to make the brow beating end.Some films are dated so poorly you can barely stomach them. The house staff is a particularly ugly reminder of black stereotypes perpetuated in Hollywood. I noticed after a while that neither of the two black actors spoke a line of dialogue without a white actor in the frame.Some of the shortcomings of this film are the dated message, for which you really can't blame it. But the real problem is the 3rd act nosedive. It spends the first two acts building a mannered, satiric social comedy only to see it literally blown sky high in exchange for maudlin monologues about harmonicas and the little people.I've heard of Capra-corn, but come on. What did this beat to win Best Picture? Errol Flynn's Robin Hood and Renoir's Grand Illusion! This should be taught in film school as the classic example of how not to end a movie.

I seem to be an exception to this rule in that I see things as they are. But one thing seems to bring everyone to agreement: You Can't Take It With You is not a good movie under any circumstances.So what is the story behind this film? As cartoony as it sounds today, it's actually about a man who gets engaged to a woman from an anarchist family following the advice from his rich, greedy father who wants their lot for themselves. The only problem is that they are a household of crazy nihilists that sees money as valueless, and cares only about living a good, fun life, because as the movie repeatedly tells us (even in the title), 'You Can't Take It With You.' That is kinda a good theme to go for, and let's face it, it's very much true, but do we really need a movie to tell us this? The theme is not that significant and it is, for the most part, common sense. The problem here though, is that the film literally criticizes those that seek profits and contrary to what the family tells us, money has value in the world, and it is important. Not only does the family borderline hates money and criticizes those that makes it, but the loony residents are supposed to be the sound mind that we are to side with (the irony is that the real world looks sane to us, but not to them. Ha. Ha. Ha.).There are a few good things going for it though; the acting is all around good (the irony that Lionel Barrymore's the hero in this film, and would go on to play Mr. Potter in It's A Wonderful Life, another Capra film). It is amusing seeing the crazy antics of that particular household too. And it makes a sound argument against the Income Tax; in a better movie, this would probably have left a significant impact on our nation. But as is, it just reached out to us without leaving a dent in the Income Tax laws in the least.So yeah, I personally didn't like this one either, and even for back then, the fact that it won Best Picture and Best Director (the film's sole wins) was considered an upset. There's very little reason for me or anyone else to recommend this film other than the possible hardcore film buff or, less likely, the most hardcore of Capra fans. At a ranking of 4 out of 10, this is film is a chaotic mess I would personally stay away from.",

I don't usually go for such brash, in-your-face optimism, but something about this ragtag group of merry, welcoming, open-hearted characters really struck a chord. Though it brims with loud personality - new faces pile in by the fistful each time we visit the house - there's a shocking level of character development at play here. That can be partially attributed to its roots in theater, and the associated volumes of dialog that are breathlessly peppered in, but I think just as much credit must go to the actors, who commit wholeheartedly to their roles (no matter how silly) and smoothly grant fast, earnest credibility. Stereotypes abound in the plot, from the sinister banker looking to tear down a merry little village to the happy-go-lucky grandpa who's always got the perfect sentimental speech prepared, but that legitimacy of character (plus the film's age) makes it all feel like a natural fit.

In the residence of Grandpa Vanderhof people live together and do exactly what they want and only what they want: children, grandchildren, sons-in-law or simply people who went there and did not leave.This anarchic family-community, perhaps a harbinger of what, thirty years later, would become the hippies contrasts sharply with the other family plot, the grumpy banker JP Kirby who, investing in the design of an ammunition plant (the movie is prior to World War II), needs to buy a whole neighborhood, but his investment is frustrated precisely by a resident who insists on not selling his property: Vanderhof that regards more the family values than any value in money.But another quarrel makes the fate of families intersect: the romance between J. P.'s son and vice president of the company, Tony, and his secretary Alice, by chance Grandpa's granddaughter who does not want to sell the house.The scene of the rich family's visit to the Sycamores house is worthy of the so-called screwball comedies of the 1930s, though the film lacks a vocation for laughter, drifting to incredibly modern themes like greed for more and more money, impoverishment of the population (would the 2008-09 Recession be a remake of the Great Depression?), and even the fear of the \"red peril,\" the Communist threat that has been attending America's electoral agendas.The ending of the movie is a good example of what was called in the Capra-corn era, movies that extol the best that was (and still is) in human nature: sensitivity, gentleness, humility, and good humor.If we understand that mankind is governed by greed, selfishness and lack of love, it is easy to understand how the solutions of You Can't Take It With You lead us to moments of pure enlightenment and dream. As Vanderhof persuades the accountant Poppins to leave the bank and move to his house to make masks and toys, he, still wary, says: \"the die is cast\".",

Most of the really critical comments come from people who saw the play first. It's quite common for fans of a book (or in this case, a play) to be disappointed in the movie. Maybe it's a good thing for me that I never saw the play. I happened to think the movie was terrific. It wasn't hysterical, but it was very amusing. It may have been preachy, but the message is as relevant today as it ever was. The acting was as good as it gets, at least from the main players - Lionel Barrymore, Eddie Albert, Jean Arthur, and Jimmy Stewart. If you don't enjoy this movie, you either have a heart of stone or you're analyzing it too much. Movies today that rely on potty humor (or worse) to get laughs, or special effects rather than truly talented performances to make points, can't begin to compare to this one. There's not an actor or actress around anymore (at least in Hollywood) who can deliver lines like Jean Arthur or Lionel Barrymore. It is a great film that makes you feel good all over. Who cares if every single aspect isn't 100% believable. If you can't tolerate anything less, watch a documentary.",

Frank Capra stated in one of the Barrymore books he visited Lionel in the hospital to approach him about doing this film. Not only did he have a broken hip that wouldn't heal (and he was in some god awful traction at the time, one can only imagine back then) he also had a flare up of rheumatoid arthritis complicating his issue.Capra said his body was a mess but not his verve! And he could only envision Lionel as Grandpa Vanderhof. I concur! So it was with this wonderful enduring thespian! One of greatest actors ever!One of my favorite scenes is him and Jean Arthur in her room. He is reminiscing about his departed wife. Just watch him here. He is not acting there, he is reflecting.. It is so\nwonderfully done! And the two in reality probably didn't know each other too well. Such pros! Actually Jean Arthur and Lionel Barrymore both were quite underrated. They were in reality two of greatest actors of the Golden age of cinema!I often think what a shame his lasting impression is Mr. Potter. There were so many other great diverse roles, this one, Dinner At Eight, Grand Hotel, One Man's Journey, Captains Courageous, Key Largo to name a few.My other fav scenes are his prayers. Wonderful and so simplistic. What a shame we didn't hold on to those values. Still holds true today.Great casting Jimmy Stewart, Jean Arthur you could not go wrong with that. They are believable and so charming together! Some criticize saying this is too unrealistic and zany of a film. Who cares? But it also has a very pertinent message even for our modern times.",

Harry Cohn, as much of a total ass as he was, was smart enough to know what an asset he had in Capra--- by 1938 (thanks to Capra) Columbia was no longer known as the biggest pile on Poverty Row-- it was a major studio. Audiences in the 30's wanted to see a Frank Capra film after the relative failure of Lost Horizon, he scored a corker with this adaptation of the hit Broadway show (begging the question whether it can be called a 'screwball comedy\"). For my cable-TV fees, it's much better than \"Holiday\"--- Jean Arthur is far more appealing than Kate Hepburn. Great cast; I wonder how hammy Lionel Barrymore got L.B. Mayer to loan him out? It's great to see a 20-ish Dub Taylor, an apparently even younger Ann Miller, Eddie Anderson (minus Mr. Benny), Donald (living up to his name) Meek, Stewart's perennial dad, Samuel S. Hinds (one can only assume Beulah Bondi wasn't available as mom) is on hand as Jean Arthur's dad, who oddly subordinates his paternal role to Mr. Barrymore. Everyone shines--- even a despondent H.B.

In `It's A Wonderful Life,' are we really meant to believe that the whole town and everyone in it would have fallen apart if James Stewart had never been born?  Please!  In the ever so tolerant household of Grandpa Vanderhoff, everyone is encouraged to be happy and live out their dream, but no one with the exception of Jean Arthur seems to be gainfully employed, so how do they keep enough food on the table to feed everyone? Most of the drudge work seems to be done by two black servants, but I notice that you don't see them eating at the same table with the white folks.  And how come the IRS hasn't clamped down on Grandpa long ago for his refusal to pay taxes?  And how would a real neighborhood feel if some nut had enough fireworks in the basement to disrupt the entire block when they go off?  The movie's class-baiting, anti-capitalist subtext is so virulent you might almost suspect Capra of being a closet Red (could this household be a Socialist commune in disguise?).  The sermonizing under the whimsy can get pretty thick.  (I understand that the whole subplot with Arnold evicting everyone on the block to make room for a shady business deal was not in the original play.)  So what's still good about this movie?  The very funny nightclub scene with Arthur and Stewart is 30's screwball humor at its best, and the whole sequence in which the Kirbys arrive for dinner one night too early is exquisite comedy of embarrassment.  Finally, the performances are so engaging that the fairy tail sentimentalism often persuades you against your better judgment.",

            "content": "Frank Capra's work a window on a time before American idealism was replaced by the more modern trend of cynicism, the age that was washed out by the devastating experiences of World War II, Vietnam and Watergate. This kind of early positive Americanism is long gone and it is such a gift to have Capra's work to remind us of a time long gone. In that way, his films are invaluable In 1934, Capra hit the ground running with \"It Happened One Night\", a film so successful and with such a far-reaching effect that it basically invented the institution of the screwball comedy and the romantic comedy. 80 years later, it still holds up. He won the Oscar for that film, and four years later won again for his adaptation of George Kaufman and Moss Hart's stage success \"You Can't Take It With You\", which had been so successful that it won the Pulitzer Prize. Capra's adaptation won Best Picture yet, while it contains all of Capra's trademark, time has not been kind and, in spite of its status in Oscar history it has more or less slipped into the dustbins of history.The movie isn't bad, just dated. The story is clunky with over-sized characterization and an antiquated theme about the value of friends over money. The story involves Capra's favorite kind of villain, the heartless corporate businessman, in this case a certain Anthony P. Kirby (Edward Arnold) The C.E.O. of Kirby and Co., a bank that seems to be booming despite the depression. Kirby wants to expand his business to get in on the munitions market and needs land to do it. He has been successful so far at buying out the residents except for one hold out who won't sell even when offered four times what the house is worth.The man causing the trouble is Martin Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore), a genial Joe who plays the harmonica and refuses to work in favor of having fun. His reason for holding out on the sale is simple: He places a value on the memories that he has tied to the house over any kind of money that Kirby is willing to shell out. Kirby is the kind of bullish business man who doesn't take no for an answer and orders his underlings to get Vanderhof and his family out of the house by any means necessary.Meanwhile, Kirby's sweet-natured son Tony (Jimmy Stewart) has become engaged to Alice Sycamore, his secretary. Unknown to either party, Alice is actually Vanderhof's granddaughter. She's actually the only normal member of the family. The rest are defined by their quirks. Sister Essie (Ann Miller) dances everywhere she goes. Her husband Ed (Dub Taylor) plays the xylophone. Penny (Spring Byington), Alices's mother bangs away on the typewriter. Paul, Alice's father (Samuel S. Hinds), plays with erector sets. A defected Russian named Boris (Mischa Auer) hangs around the house and acts as Essie's dance instructor. And a new member of the household, Mr. Poppins (Donald Meek), likes to make things.Everyone in the house has a personality quirk and they are so quirky because Mr. Vanderhof allows their qualities to flourish. He describes his household as \"a place where everyone does what they want.\" Naturally, it isn't long before the blue-blooded Kirby's and the bohemian Sycamores have a culture clash that brings Vanderhof to full-froth over Kirby's greed and lack of humanity. It's all too obvious.Nothing seems to work here. The message is inane and dated. The characters are all types, not people. The romance is dull, which is surprising given that they are played by Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur. The movie has no grace or reality. It is the kind of movie that is set up to push its message and does so with the hammer. What once seemed fresh and original has dated badly, especially in the wake of similar social message pictures that Capra would make later like \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" and \"It's a Wonderful Life\". What we have here is third-rate Capra, the work of a director whose films would improve over time.** (of four)",

            "content": "...at Grandpa van der Hoof (Vanderhof?)'s house. I actually think I dream of it.It's been a long time since I last read the actual Kaufman/Hart play, but time never lapses long before I find myself wanting to see Frank Capra's screen version of \"You Can't Take It With You.\" If Robert Riskin's screenplay mutes some of the socialist fervor of the original, where certainly Grandpa wouldn't have suggested substituting \"Americanism\" for \"Socialism,\" it does create a dichotomy between an uptight social-climbing society, symbolized by the \"Kirbys,\" and the happy if rather chaotic society of Grandpa and his family.I don't think it is entirely a mistake that, in the fictional New York City of Kaufman/Hart/ Riskin that Grandpa is a representative of the city's (Dutch) past, i.e., \"van der Hoof\" and that the symbol of predatory capitalism is Kirby, representative of a \"modern\" WASP point of view that desires an exclusivity it can never really possess. I also don't think that the law's preoccupation with the unintentional--or at least harmless--gaffes of the Vanderhofs and their friends are unintentional on the part of the writers or the director. In a sense, I find it entirely fitting that people who ostensibly come from a much older heritage might find some of the statutory adventures of modern society constraining.Andrew Carnegie is supposed to have said \"The man who dies rich dies disgraced,\" which is a hair's breadth away from \"You can't take it with you.\" (In fact, I once proposed that a portrait of Carnegie along with \"You can't take it with you\" be a symbol for my non-profit management school, but they just didn't get it.)As a happy beneficiary of Mr. Carnegie's fortune, and as a lover of American cinema, I suggest that this film is one of the greatest ever made, and certainly the summit of Capra's contribution. It epitomizes the idea of the freewheeling American spirit of which capitalism is merely a part, contrasted with the narrower point of view that encourages homogeneity and acquisition. The Vanderhof/Sycamore clan lives in a big old house that has room for everyone, even for people with whom they don't agree--and others are lessened in comparison.The cast for this film is incredible, and Capra brings out the best in them. It is undoubtedly the best of all Lionel Barrymore's roles, which is saying a lot, but there's a lot of Dr. Gillespie in Grandpa, isn't there? Spring Byington, Jean Arthur, James Stewart, Donald Meek, Harry Davenport, Charles Lane, Dub Taylor, Mischa Auer, and Edward Arnold were all wonderful. It would be remiss for me not to point out that Ann Miller never had a better role--or was better in a role--in her entire career. (Whether or not this is the fault of MGM's \"Freed Unit\" may be debated, but I think it is.) She's adorable, and legend has it that she was 14 at the time!The film has its ironies: the whole neighborhood is depending upon Grandpa to void it's agreements to sell its property to Kirby and Co, to which it, individually and severally, has already submitted.There are also little jokes: DePinna's was once a famous New York department store, and Mr. DePinna was the Iceman that came and never left; my personal favorite is when Dub Taylor (Ed) is playing Chopin's \"Grand Valse Brilliante\" on the xylophone, and \"Essie\" (Ann Miller) says\"Oh, I like that, Ed. Yours?\"\"No, Chopin.\"\"It's got a lot of you in it!\" The thing to remember about this film is that everybody in it is SANE, and its message is that we depend upon people like Grandpa to keep us going. As I said: I think I have always wanted to live in that house: there's room enough to be oneself, room enough for others, and when somebody stops by, they find you just as you are, not as you're supposed to be.",

The whole movie suffers from that whole early Hollywood \"wholesomeness\" that directors were either forced into or chose to stay in those days. Now the play was by no means dark, but it had a sort of edge that caused the family to be depicted as truly unique. Here, they're just a little strange, but nothing that would be noticed. I like how they really tried to add scenes outside the home, to make it more than just filming the play, but the added scenes don't have the charm of the original Kaufman/Hart script. They could have used a few more rewrites.\nThe underlying story is good, and I especially liked seeing Lionel Barrymore playing the same role I did (I have to admit, he did a much better job).

Grandpa spends his days playing his harmonica and attending the graduation ceremonies of people he doesn't know. His daughter, Penny, decided to become the next George Bernard Shaw after someone dropped a typewriter at the home by mistake. Granddaughter Essie dances very, very badly, and her sister Alice, rebelling against her family of rebels, decides to become a banker's secretary (she still finds time to slide down banisters, though). Grandpa, it should be known, hasn't paid his taxes, well, ever, and his defense of this fact to the rather dunderheaded IRS agent who comes a'calling has been lauded by Tea Party types and abhorred by modern- day liberals as a polemic in favor of bathtub-sized government. Yet it should be noted that another resident of the house is on government relief and Grandpa seems totally fine with that. He may have thought through his rejection of soulless corporate America, but that doesn't mean he's right or consistent about everything. SPOILER AHEADWhat's more, for all his praise of the virtues of friendship over money, he actually betrays his friends pretty epically when he agrees to sell the house to a company trying to take over his neighborhood. While he does this in order to move closer to Alice, it nearly gets all his neighbors evicted. Not very friendly, right?END SPOILERDoes all this mean that Grandpa is a bad person? No. Is he a questionable role model? Yes, and Frank Capra's attempt to make him a populist hero doesn't quite work. But you should watch and enjoy the hell out of You Can't Take It With You--it's touching, hilarious, and does contain genuine insights on how to live a good life. But don't go to it for a ready- to-serve political belief system. Go for the wish fulfillment: the chance to imagine doing exactly what you want with your life without fear of failure or poverty. I've got a good idea about what I'd do (drawing, acting, college classes on film appreciation, etc.), and I suspect you do too.",

But, finally I sat down to watch it in its entirety. No question, this is definitely \"Capra-corn\", and it's delicious.For me, one of its most interesting aspects was the performance of Lionel Barrymore. A few days earlier I had watched a film where he was the villain, and here he was his most charming, lovable (and crippled) self. What a wonderful actor he was.And there is the bevy of character actors...some recognizable by name, others just by sight. But in this film, they are the core of the story -- a bunch of eccentrics living together in a huge house that is the target of a rich corporation...owned by the father (Edward Arnold) of Jimmy Stewart, who just happens to be in love with Jean Arthur, the granddaughter of Lionel Barrymore. But before I move onto them, let me get back to the character actors: including the delightful Spring Byington, a very young Ann Miller before her MGM years, Donald Meek (you'll definitely recognize him), and Eddie \"Rochester\" Anderson...just for starters.Jimmy Stewart was well established in films by this point, but he is still so young looking. He is great in the love scenes...plays them in a rather understated manner that seems very real. Jean Arthur is an interesting actress...so good...and yet I have always had the feeling that she fit perfectly in that particular era of films, and after World War II never quite fit again. Probably the strongest performance in the film, though it develops mostly later in the film, is that of Edward Arnold...watch for his change of perspective...a true acting gem.",

Not so. they portray the reality of how life really is and for 1938, it was very difficult. His movies also show how simple life can be if you don't get involved in too many intracacies. (A lost art in itself.) As a person who was not living in 1938, but have several relatives who were adults and are still living from that era, it is a comedy that can identify with many people's problems from that time. It is a movie reflective of Frank Capra's values of getting to where he was by hard work, instead of people going to college to make movies and today give us nothing but a lot of noise and flashing lights and who have always had it easy and have nothing in their background to show anything.",

The problem is that this is the one household that won't sell out to Stewart's father who wants to buy all the lots in the surrounding neighbourhood to build a factory. The film's message is: don't worry so much about making lots of money because \"you can't take it with you\" to the afterlife - spend your time enjoying life to the fullest.

            "content": "Frank Capra saw the play You Can't Take It with You by George Kaufman and Moss Hart and immediately wanted to make a film of it. Using his power as president of the Academy in contract negotiations with Harry Cohn, president of Columbia, to buy the rights and grant the assignment to Capra, an effort that led to his third Best Director Oscar and second Best Picture win. Released after one of the major dips within the Great Depression, it's a wholesome tale of the common man finding common cause with the upper classes in their common humanity. It feels like textbook Capra, written by Robert Riskin, and it has a wonderful impact more than seventy years later.Anthony Kirby (Edward Arnold) is banker who comes home from Washington DC having secured the approval of Congress to proceed with an attempted monopoly of arms manufacture in America. His son, Tony (James Stewart) is something of a dreamer whom his father has been grooming to enter into the banking business, in the family tradition. He is in a relationship with his stenographer Alice (Jean Arthur) who is part of a large family led by the patriarch, her grandfather Martin (Lionel Barrymore), a dreamer himself who uses his modest wealth to maintain a household of people encouraged to pursue their own passions. Her mother Penny (Spring Byington) writes plays. Her father Paul (Samuel S. Hinds) makes fireworks in the basement. Her sister Essie (Ann Miller) dances under the instruction of Potap (Mischa Auer) while her husband Ed (Dub Taylor) plays the xylophone. There's a small subplot where Kirby is trying to buy up a section of the city to build a munitions factory, a section that includes the central house that Martin politely and good-naturedly refuses, even going to the real estate office where he meets a bookkeeper Mr. Poppins (Donald Meek) with a propensity for making small toys in his spare time, a skill that Martin appreciates and invites Mr. Poppins into the house for a spell.The heart of the film is, surprisingly, the elder Kirby, and I think that's a change from the original play (that I've never read nor seen performed). It's less about the zany antics of the Martin household and more about the melting of the icy heart of the upper classes who have lost connection with the common man in the pursuit of material wealth. The path of that is through the relationship between his son and Martin's granddaughter.The first half of the film is dedicated to the building of the wide array of characters, setting up the framework for the latter half of the film, and it's solid fun. The interplay of the characters within the house is amusing, especially when Mr. Poppins is introduced to the household (our introduction), and when Tony comes to visit, a proposal hanging in the air, there's a very fun little episode as he watches Martin politely and kindly tells off a representative of the IRS when he comes to collect back taxes (that Martin had never paid on principle). Martin may be odd, but he's not some gadfly without purpose. He's a man dedicated to keeping in touch with what he finds important in life, and that is the people around him.The back half of the film revolves around a dinner between Martin's family and the Kirbys. Tony intentionally brings his parents on the wrong day, hoping to find a way to get his parents to discover the charm of the family he's marrying into, but it turns into a disaster. There had been plans for a big fireworks spectacle that Mr. Poppins had had the idea of theming with the Russian Revolution. Ed had handed out pamphlets to get people excited about it in candy that they sell, and it attracted the attention of the police because they thought he was organizing a real revolution. They come to arrest him while the Kirbys are there, but the fireworks all go off in the basement at once because of an accident. This leads to everyone getting arrested.It's in jail where the senior Kirby is brought down the most, trapped in a large cell with the bums of the city and his potential in-laws. It leads to him letting out his true feelings about Martin and his family, about how there's a world of difference between him and the rest, and it leads to Martin being angry for the only time in the film, telling off Anthony Kirby about how he has nothing.This gets demonstrated in classic Capra fashion with the people of the neighborhood coming out in the middle of the night to night court to give Martin their support naturally while Kirby has to beg and plead to get into contact with his own lawyers, the only ones who show.There's a great use of images through the film that really helps carry the emotional implications and delivers the emotional punches that the film puts out. First is the obvious one: a harmonica. A gift from Alice to Martin early in the film, it's a common connection with Anthony whom Tony describes as having played the harmonica in his youth. Martin drops the harmonica into Tony's pocket in the prison, and he carries it through the rest of the film, using it as a visual device that gets literally thrown back and forth on a table at one point as he goes back and forth on his desire to continue as he is or forge a new path. The other image is talked about early, about how Martin had had a good job thirty-five years earlier, but one day, as he rode up the elevator to his job, he decided that he wasn't having any fun. So, he just went back down and never went back. This gets repeated late, and that it doesn't get explicitly commented on is what gives the moment its power. It works wonderfully well, capturing everything we need to know about the character in that moment.There's a resolution that brings everyone together in heartwarming fashion, and it never feels cheap or unearned because the characters created are so rich and detailed, the events so clearly designed for the development of those characters, and the performances always feel so genuine. The obvious centerpiece if Barrymore as Martin, and, despite the physical pain he was evidently going through during the whole shoot, he is a delightful rock on which the film is based. The supporting cast is well utilized, especially the young Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur, but it's Edward Arnold's performance as the elder Kirby that really provides the emotional core of the film. The story ends up his, and his subtle shifts over the film culminate in the film's best moments.This is a treasure of a film. Frank Capra working at the top of his powers in Hollywood to intelligently and effectively translate from another medium into cinema.",

            "content": "You Can't Take it With You was the second Frank Capra film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture (after It Happened One Night) and the third to win him a Best Director Oscar. Like It Happened One Night, it's a screwball comedy and although it is very entertaining, it is very much a product of its time: it's hard to imagine it being Oscar winning material nowadays.\nIn keeping with screwball comedies of the era, You Can't Take it With You features fast-talking dialogue, farce, and a central relationship between a strong female lead and a somewhat put-upon male lead. The story sees Tony Kirby - the son of rich banker Anthony P. Kirby - falling in love with a stenographer named Alice Sycamore, whose eccentric family just happen to live in a house that Kirby senior wants to buy in order to secure a lucrative deal. Alice's grandfather Martin Vanderhof however is determined not to sell, leaving the happy couple caught in the middle. Cue much wrangling and clashing of family members on the way to the inevitable happy ending.\nIt's quite good fun and frequently very funny, for example during the disastrous family dinner that culminates in numerous illegal fireworks exploding and both families being arrested, and during the slapstick restaurant scene. When it isn't laugh-out-loud funny, it's often amusing, from amateur toymaker Poppins being entranced by Grandpa's advice and deciding to quit his day job, to Grandpa Vanderhof's good-natured argument about income tax with increasingly frustrated IRS agent Wilbur G. Henderson. At times however, the eccentricity of Alice's family feels very forced and some of the humour falls flat.\nThe best scenes are the more philosophical ones that focus on the characters rather than the plot. Tony Kirby and Alice Sycamore are ostensibly the leads, but it is Grandpa Vanderhof and Anthony P. Kirby who get the best scenes together, as the former's outlook on life - which emphasises fun over profit - gradually wins over the latter. Lionel Barrymore is endearing as Grandpa, whilst Edward Arnold gives an excellent, often subtle performance as Anthony P. Kirby, who undergoes one of the biggest character journeys in the film. The scene near the end when Grandpa and Anthony sit down and play harmonica together is hard not to like.\nWhilst overshadowed by their relatives, Tony and Alice work sufficiently well that the audience is likely to want them to overcome the obstacles to their happiness. Jean Arthur gives a vivacious performance as Alice Sycamore, who is capable of answering a phone even when Tony is holding her hands, whilst James Stewart is well-cast as Tony: essentially, despite his posh upbringing, he's the most ordinary character in a film filled with eccentrics and ruthless businessmen, and therefore provides the story with its heart and Stewart brings a disarming innocence to the role.\nAs in most of his films, Capra eschews flashy techniques, instead letting the performances shine, but his direction is as skilful as ever. The cinematography makes good use of wide-angle shots that show off the complex sets of the Vanderhof house. The film champions the little people, as demonstrated by Grandpa's steadfast refusal to sell his house and taking on the financial might of Kirby in the process: this sort of a thing is a common theme in Capra's work. You Can't Take it With You now mostly just looks quaint, like the relic of a bygone Hollywood age that it is: compared to other Best Picture Oscar winners from the era, it seems over-rated, but it is nonetheless quite good fun.",

            "content": "I'd forgotten how therapeutic a bit of Capra-corn could be. I sat down to a pleasant romantic comedy about two lovers overcoming their class differences, but ended the film practically in tears \u0096 tears of joy, as only Frank Capra could produce. 'You Can't Take It with You (1938)' was the first of the director's collaborations with Jimmy Stewart. However, the heart of the film actually centres around another familiar Capra face, Lionel Barrymore \u0096 who, never to be forced into retirement by his painful arthritis, acts the entire film on crutches. Forget the dastardly Mr. H.F. Potter, his Martin Vanderhof is the \"richest\" man in town, not because he has very much money, but because his kindness and sense of community has made him more friends than he can count {this is a theme that Capra used regularly; see 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936)' and 'It's a Wonderful Life (1946)'}. But the daughter (Jean Arthur) in the hopelessly-eccentric Vanderhof family has fallen in love with the son (Stewart) of a rich banker (Edward Arnold), incidentally the poorest man in town.An evening with the Vanderhofs is something akin to a Marx Brothers movie, with each character doing their own thing without regard for what outsiders might think. While some family members test fireworks in the basement, sister Essie (Ann Miller) practices her ballet to the xylophone music of her husband (Samuel S. Hinds), as her uptight Russian instructor Boris (Mischa Auer) complains that everything \"stinks.\" Mother Penny (Spring Byington) attempts to finish writing a play, and Alice (Jean Arthur) slides down the staircase banister. With twelve activities happening at once, it's the farce of 'Arsenic and Old Lace (1944)' without those troublesome murders. But behind all this chaos is the unmistakable unity of a close-knit family, and (as in many Capra films) it only takes a recognisable musical tune to bring together the Vanderhofs \u0096 and the snobbish Kirbys \u0096 for a collective performance that is genuinely charming in its sincerity. At least you can always be assured that a Frank Capra film will always leave you feeling good about yourself, the world, and the people in it.Alongside the compassionate performances of Barrymore and Edward Arnold, enjoyable performances are also given by James Stewart and Jean Arthur, such that they repeated their love affair in 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939).' 'You Can't Take It with You' was adapted by Capra-regular Robert Riskin from a successful play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. I found it interesting that the screenplay bore what appeared to be a socialist slant, with Martin Vanderhof decidedly rejecting capitalist labour in favour of performing his preferred tasks for a minimum wage. This approach, we are shown, leaves one happier and assists the wellbeing of the entire community. I'm not so certain, however, of Vanderhof's insistence on not paying income tax, on the basis that he's not getting anything back from the government \u0096 this doesn't seem socialist, nor does it sound particularly \"American,\" either. Even so, everybody can sympathise with the notion that money isn't everything, and that a single kindhearted gesture can go much further than a thousand dollar bills.",

That is most evident here, where it is clear that all the performers completely enjoy each other's company. The great Jimmy Stewart, himself the acme of understated performance, noticeably defers to Barrymore time and again.

I am a big fan of Jean Arthur (Grandpa Vanderhof's granddaughter) and Jimmy Stewart (Mr. Kirby's silver-spoon fed son and love interest of Ms. Vanderhof) as well and their chemistry in this movie was very good.

            "content": "Tosh - pure but not entirely simple, and not entirely benign.  Like most of Capra's output it concerns paternal and paternalist authority, and how they ought to function in an authentic American ideology where family-oriented conservatism and individual libertarianism have to come to some sort of accord.  As in \"It Happened One Night\" the central problem is a father figure who has to be converted (the mother here *doesn't* have to be converted, except gesturally and as a joke once the drama is over - maternal authority is an irrelevance in Capra's fatherly world).  The conversion can carry no conviction whatever at the level of characterisation in either film; Walter Connolly's sheer talent carries it off handsomely in \"It Happened One Night\", but it was expecting too much from any actor to do the same for the ludicrous role of Kirby Sr., and Edward Arnold isn't in Connolly's class.Of course it shouldn't be a drawback that a comedy is ludicrous, but this is a desperately serious, self-important comedy, scattered with deadly speechifying that the script can't then laugh off.  The result here is embarrassingly juvenile as political discourse and rather too slow, talky and stagy as film comedy.  Capra the director has great fun with some individual scenes, though others are very slackly edited and directed without much imagination, and he presides over lovely performances from Stewart (playing the same character as usual) and Jean Arthur (in a dullish, underwritten role), notably in their first scene together (she on the telephone); Lionel Barrymore looks generally rather joyless, which actually makes the role more palatable than as written - one gets the impression that all his jollity is forced, and that the spectral presence of his dead wife is what really drives the film.  This is curious, because the principal living wife (Mary Forbes, imperious as Mrs A. P. Kirby) is, as I've said, a mere figure of fun, designed to make her husband look salvageable by comparison.The argument appears to be that all of society is one big extended family (the whole block calls Barrymore 'Grandpa', not just his own household) and the film hopes to use the model to justify a paradoxical conservatism in which the good really do know and like their place, but have also chosen it. It wants to imagine a proto-drop-out society within the heart of old-fashioned communities, in which everyone is doing what they love most, yet still have black servants; in which everyone looks out for each other, but you can allow the eviction of all your neighbours of decades' standing, to run off after your own daughter (there comes a point where nuclear family and extended family don't pull together any longer).  It gets more and more inconsistent the more you think about it.  But it does have a few good laughs.",

            "content": "With this delightful and very 1930s creation, Frank Capra produced his second Best Picture winner and earned his third Academy Award for Best Direction. It is also the third time he had been granted permission to have his name above the title. Ah Vanitus Vanitatum! Methinks the glory had gone to his head somewhat.You Can't Take It with You is, as it happens, very well directed, so let's focus a little on that first of all. In contrast to his over-sized ego when it came to packaging his productions, Frank Capra at least was pleasantly subtle behind the camera. He concentrated most on simply and clearly framing the actors with long takes and uncomplicated backgrounds. He rarely uses attention-grabbing techniques, and when he does it is usually worked neatly into the flow of the picture \u2013 for example a whip pan in the fast-paced opening scene, or the matching up of shots between the closing of the lift doors and the opening of the serving hatch, which gives a memorable introduction to the home in which most of the action takes place. His simplistic approach to the quieter moments of intimacy gives them a lot of weight, especially when compared to the bustle of most of the other scenes.But there is much more going on here that cannot be attributed to the able hand of Signor Capra. We have another great script by that genius of the 30s screenplay, Robert Riskin. It's a fairly loose and very cinematic adaptation of the George Kaufman/Moss Hart stage play, which is in itself a lovely story. But Riskin has given it a pace that will work on the screen, as well as adding many of his own touches. The character of Mr Poppins is Riskin's invention, as are many major scenes, such as James Stewart and Jean Arthur's talk in the park, the subsequent \"Big Apple\" routine and the business in the restaurant. The result is faithful to the tone of the original play, but also feels as if it was original material written for the pictures.And now we come to the cast. This was an era in which most performers, leads included, were not so much chameleons becoming absorbed in character as we expect them to be today. Many of them had one persistent persona that allowed them to fit into the right kind of role. This wasn't a weakness because they still acted well and engaged the audience, and indeed it was the familiarity and likability of these players that made their pictures work. You Can't Take It with You is one of the best examples of this. Take the wonderful Jean Arthur. You could really believe this is the sort of family she comes home to when she leaves the studio at night. When you look at Jimmy Stewart across his career, it's as if you're seeing the same man at various stages of his life. Watching him here it's easy to forget that he was relatively unknown at the time, but still his demeanour must have made audiences immediately warm to him. Through and through this is a tale of characters \u2013 the Lionel Barrymores, the Spring Byingtons and of course the Donald Meeks.Frank Capra, crafty director and shrewd producer as he was, could still not have made a joy like this without equally skilled collaborators. Although he was yet to make two undisputed masterpieces after this (Mr Smith Goes to Washington and It's A Wonderful Life), this is probably the personal highpoint of his career. Capra's failure to accept art as a committee was to be his undoing, and he would find it harder and harder to get a consistent team. Yes, the name above the title was a great one, but the ones under it were pretty special too.",

This is a wonderful feel good film with some beautiful comedic and romantic scenes as well as some decent dramatic moments.Jean Arthur, always disarming, is at her most beguiling in this movie and the park bench scene where she playfully entices Tony to continue kissing her is utterly adorable.  The hilarious nightclub scene is without a doubt one of the most perfectly crafted comedic scenes ever- I end up hiding behind my hands (right along with James Stewart) every time and few other movie scenes still have me laughing out loud 20 years after originally seeing it.While not providing the same dramatic opportunities of (say) Mr Smith Goes to Washington (undoubtedly the quintessential Capra movie which is nevertheless not my personal favourite), this film does ably demonstrate how Frank Capra knew that James Stewart would be up to the task of handling the final scenes in Mr Smith.  Mr Stewart, as Tony, seems genuinely bereft in his scenes with the Vanderhoffs and his father following the dinner party debacle, to the extent that I often find myself looking at him wondering if he has lost weight!  One further point to James Stewart's credit - he had the sense to recognise Jean Arthur as `the finest actress I ever worked with'.As always with Capra, the quality of the performances of the supporting cast is superb and the scenes between Lionel Barrymore and Jean Arthur are lovely as are the Vanderhoff ensemble scenes but for my money (hopeless romantic that I am) James Stewart and Jean Arthur on screen together is where this film shines - they made the cutest couple of the thirties, if not longer!",

I don't usually go for such brash, in-your-face optimism, but something about this ragtag group of merry, welcoming, open-hearted characters really struck a chord. Though it brims with loud personality - new faces pile in by the fistful each time we visit the house - there's a shocking level of character development at play here. That can be partially attributed to its roots in theater, and the associated volumes of dialog that are breathlessly peppered in, but I think just as much credit must go to the actors, who commit wholeheartedly to their roles (no matter how silly) and smoothly grant fast, earnest credibility. Stereotypes abound in the plot, from the sinister banker looking to tear down a merry little village to the happy-go-lucky grandpa who's always got the perfect sentimental speech prepared, but that legitimacy of character (plus the film's age) makes it all feel like a natural fit. And really, don't some themes ring eternal? A true classic that warms the heart and reminds us to slow down and ensure we're still getting all we want from life.",

Donald Meek played charming inventor Mr Poppins, stuck in a mundane job and rescued by Vanderhof; though his character faded away and seemed quite pointless given the initial screen time.

Many of the Depression era movies seem to have a somewhat anti-capitalist tone in them and it is understandable given the heavy emphasis on profit making just before the market crash. This movie has an engaged couple (James Stewart and Jean Arthur) with one living in high society (Stewart) and the other in a lower class community with eccentric relatives. The movie has a common theme of class and status conflict that comes out of attempted unions of differing backgrounds. Edward Arnold plays the rich dad while Lionel Barrymore plays the lower class grandfather. The movie's main message of not putting too much emphasis on making money and to enjoy the simpler things in life fits with many of other Capra's films. There is even a scene involving an IRS agent who tries to collect on back taxes from the lower class family. The scene was taken in a rather humorous light with the Lionel Barrymore refusing to acknowledge any debt to the government. His rationale sounds much like many of the stances taken by tax protesters of the current time. This movie seems to share the theme and casting from \"It's a Wonderful Life\". Lionel Barrymore who played the money grubbing villain in the later movie instead is the anti-profit \"hero\" in this movie. James Stewart's role in this movie appears to not be central as the George Bailey role in \"It's a Wonderful Life\". The movie is a good screwball comedy that won the Best Picture and Best Director Oscars in 1938. Personally, I think the storyline and plot were better developed and acted in \"It's a Wonderful Life\" than this movie. The later movie also received Oscar Best Picture and Best Director nominations, but did not win any Oscars.

It tells the story of two totally different families in all aspects, which end up related and accused of an absurd legal matter where it reveals the principles of each family. Obviously all this has the usual sweetish touch of the director and treats it with a lot of comedy and little solemnity.It's a good movie taking context in that year, but it ends up being a bit monotonous and you can notice a certain filling. It is enjoyed but until there. In the technical aspects everything is correct: direction, script, production, etc. It cast is very good although Lionel Barrymore's beast stands out and not only for being the protagonist, the simplicity and warmth that his character generates is great. The voice of Jean Arthur became unbearable and her love drama with James Stewart was necessary but it was nothing that transcended. Spring Byington is nominated for 'Best Supporting Actress' in this funny and unusual role that it was noticed. In general the whole cast was neat.I understand the Oscar for 'Best Picture' because that year it was quite weak with films, they are all correct but none are surprising.I suppose that this tape was helped by the human message that comes more than the familiar and makes the phrase that says: \"You work to live or you live to work\" resound in a United States that is growing more and more industrially.",

His take on high society and the what's best in the soul of the common man is clear and dead on.  The best thing about Capra is that he brings out the best in you. (Why can't they make movies like this today?)The cast is outstanding. Many of the faces from all the other great Capra films. It's wonderful to see Lionel Barrymore play the completely opposite role from his Mr. Potter in Wonderful Life.This movie is required viewing for all Franco Capra fans. It's no wonder that it won both the best picture & director Oscar for 1938.",

            "content": "This is a great movie. Loved it in all it's silliness and great moral lesson. In 2016, this is a great movie for the USA culture lost in the values of \"Money is king\" and \"Following your passion will always lead to success.\"The movie does a great job showing how \"wealth at all costs\" breeds arrogance beyond law and the common good of humanity. It also does a great job showing that the root of happiness is creativity, even if creativity doesn't lead to success, and seeking the common good of society. It shows a Utopian ideal that everyone can be happy if we allow everyone to just be themselves and each person pitches in to help the common good of everyone regardless of their station in life.A great perspective that even a \"rich kid\" who is in love still cannot fully grasp respect of persons despite his love. (The restaurant scene.) He had ample opportunities not to embarrass his beloved but takes advantage of her situation for the pleasure of a laugh. Hence, he's drawn to her innocent courage and freedom from fear but still is tied to the conditioning of his parents. He is own pursuit of happiness is bound by his family's wealth until he finally breaks from it.Great - awesome in fact - portrayal that the rich aren't just accepted. One has to earn their way into the hearts and lives of others regardless of the size of their wallet. And, earning your way into the lives of others is something we must all work towards.No doubt, there are some flaws against reality. One example is a person not paying their income taxes for 20+ years. Also, the viewer is left wondering how does the poor family maintain their livelihood. Friends coming to the financial rescue (but this drives the moral that if you seek the common good, there is a tangible payback). There's scenes that will offend some post-modern sensibilities - sexual harassment in the workplace, early 20th century buffoonery from black actors, Russians are uncouth, etc.Interesting how the movie pushes the common good but adds just a small subtlety of how communism is bad. The middle class is the hero and the \"right way\" for humanity. It has a strong Republican message but a Republican view that supports the common good of the middle class and not serving the wealthy alone.Grandpa is an interesting central character. All wise, ever loving, willing to sacrifice self, creative, free, and capable of enjoying rest, reconciling with enemies, not burdened by ecclesiology but religious. His sprained foot could be interpreted as the cross he bares for loving his children - an inconvenience that cannot rob him of his intrinsic joy. He even doesn't give into temptation of throwing a dart yet speaks the truth that hurts the ego of people who are lost in a life of oppressive wealth. He finished his work years ago and \"came down the elevator\" to enjoy his creation and family. He is an image of the Christian god or at least the Christian ideal. If Grandpa is the Christian God. Anthony Kirby is likened to Satan, who oppresses everyone around him and even causes the death of a person who once was his friend. He has worldly power but it cannot withstand the common good or Grandpa's wisdom and charity. But eventually, he repents of his sins.Another Christian motif is the harmonica. When one is focused on the wrong things in life, there is no song in his heart. But if one is right with God (be like Grandpa), life becomes a song which invites others into the joy of it. Definitely a classic in my book. Hollywood doesn't make them like they use to.",

Obviously, I don't remember much about the play itself, except that it did involve an unusual family in their home. Frank Capra's film version is yet another notch in his \"feel-good\" movie belt, which includes \"It Happened One Night\" (1934), \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\" (1936) and \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946).Lionel Barrymore (great-uncle of actress Drew Barrymore) seems quite at ease at Martin Vanderhof, patriarch of the family (and host to the eccentric guests) within his home. Edward Arnold's performance as Anthony P. Kirby would seem almost clich\u00e9 by today's standards. It would seem that his acquisition of property in order to construct a factory in order to force his rival to do business with him is his only goal. As for Jimmy Stewart, he's always been good in \"aw-shucks\" roles, and this one is no different. As Kirby's son, Tony, Stewart comes across (quite accurately) as a young man who is an idealist and dreamer, and not the future banker his father wants him to be. I should note that Tony once thought about the possibility of solar power, something as fictional in 1938 as faster-than-light travel is today. But I digress...The entire Vanderhof household consists of people who pretty much do as they wish, whether it is dancing all the time, writing plays (simply because a typewriter arrived by mistake), playing the harmonica, even making fireworks in the basement! The message in \"You Can't Take It With You\" is simple: The pursuit of the pleasures of life will give you more riches than all the money you make.This is a nice little film, very whimsical and very Capra. It's not his best work, but it still holds up pretty well.",

A couple sitting in a dimly lit porch, necking, and dancing with children was my favorite scene. There was a lot of humor that i enjoyed in the film, simple little humor that some wouldn't pick up on, but for me it struck a cord. I enjoyed the look back into the eyes of the social scene in the 1930's. The clash between classes, the way of words, and the styles are all something that really stuck out for me.

Tony (Jimmy Stewart) and Alice (Jean Arthur) become engaged and bring their families together for the wedding. Tony's family is The Kirby's, the rich snobbish Wall Street business-types and Alice's family is The Sycamores, the eccentric, good-natured Southern folks. The best parts of the movie are the Sycamore family, particularly with Grandpa Martin (Lionel Barrymore), who, despite his physical handicap and lower social status, is an optimist and supportive of his family. He's such a cheery soul, even when playing his harmonica, you have no chance but to give into his joyousness. On the downside, the main leads are pretty, but thoroughly forgettable characters. Also, Meriam Kirby (Mary Forbes) is just as bland, except she's the typical rich snob stereotype that might as well grumble and utter quotes like \"Most unorthodox\" or \"How revolting,\" but that's part of the point. Playwrights George Kaufman and Moss Hart wrote the play in tribute to the tropes of Commedia dell'Arte, so I can't fault the actors for playing stock characters. Furthermore, this especially works in a conventional and fun movie like this. While not as classical as It Happened One Night, You Can't Take It With You contains as much charm and joy as any other comedy.\n\n(4 Crows Carrying Fireworks out of 5)",

It also garnered Capra his third win as Best Director.\n\nThe theme is a simple yet poignant one, kindness and love are much more important than money and things. Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur) is a young woman from a very happy yet financially meager family. She falls in love with Tony Kirby (Jimmy Stewart), a vice-president at a bank run by his father. His father is close to settling a business merger that will make their wealthy family even wealthier. After Tony proposes marriage it becomes time for the families to meet.\n\nThe movie is based upon a play, and I can see Alice's family faring well with a live audience. But rather than coming off as quaint and eccentric on film, most of them come off as one dimensional equivalents of a brownstone Addams Family. In the basement a new comer spends all hours making scary masks, another older family member continually sets off fireworks in the house, Alice's mother continually types, and daft sister Essie (Ann Miller) spends every upright moment pirouetting and jet\u00e9-ing throughout whatever room she is in. Their household is headed by Alice's grandfather Martin Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore) who encourages everyone to live life doing what they want to do.\n\nBy comparison, Tony's parents are extremely superficial and concerned only about status and wealth. As expected, the Kirby's disapprove of their son's choice for a wife, and their first meeting with her family ends up with everyone going to jail. In Capra-esque fashion, Mr. Kirby (Edward Arnold) eventually reevaluates his priorities and abandons his lifelong superficial ways in order to finally enjoy living and to share in his son's happiness.\n\nThe message is a splendid one that is applicable for all generations. With that said, the movie is quite dated. One can't help but notice the irony of Alice stating how everyone in her home is encouraged to do whatever they want to do in order to live life happily, while simultaneously they are being doted on by two African-American household servants who obviously aren't able to entertaining such a philosophy. It is a fine \"feel good\" film that reflects the America idealized by many from the time period.",

Perhaps it's the lumping of all eccentrics into the box of some enlightened upper echelon while more practical people are condemned to live half lives. Maybe it's the fact that morality is completely binary in these films. Perhaps it's the tendency for Capra to base the resolution for his conflicts on some antagonist realizing the error of his ways and throwing their entire character out the window. I have a suspicion it's simply because time has revealed that, as Cassevettes suggested, \"there never was an America ... it was all Frank Capra\", and in America, the idealists never really win.

This film is one of his many successes as it won the Academy Award for Best Picture in the same year that Angels with Dirty Faces (1938) and Of Human Hearts (1938) were released. I really liked it even as I could feel it aggressively tugging at my heartstrings which made me feel rather guilty for loving it so much. When a film emotionally manipulates you so well however I do believe it's deserving of praise for it's performances, writing and direction which are completely sublime.\n\nAlice Sycamore, Jean Arthur, is the youngest member of the eccentric Sycamore family, led by Grandpa Vanderhof, Lionel Barrymore, and her mother Penny Sycamore, Spring Byington. She is in love with her boss, the wealthy Tony Kirby, James Stewart, and they get engaged despite the disapproval of his snooty banker parents Anthony P. Kirby, Edward Arnold. Complicating things further is the fact that the Kirby family needs to own the land that the Sycamores live upon in order to put his business adversary out of business. When the Kirbys show up for dinner at the Kirbys house on the wrong night they encounter just how kooky they are and prejudices are revealed.\n\nThe story was so sweet, love prevails despite significant obstacles, that I couldn't help but be charmed and the characters were sketched with more detail than in more modern versions of this story. We actually spend time getting to know Alice and Tony before their families come into conflict and when we know why they love each other you really want them to stay together. The dialogue given to the haughty Mrs. Kirby is also fittingly infuriating as my hatred for her as a villain grew more and more the longer she was on screen. The film never asks you to be charmed by this insufferable woman as she is but asks you to want her to change. Seeing both Mr. and Mrs. Kirby overcome their prejudices was joyful and the image of two very different families happily united is a beautiful one.\n\nThe performances added to the brilliance of the film as Jean Arthur proves why she is one of the greatest romantic comedy leads of all time and James Stewart flexes his comedy muscles. They are both so lovely together and the fact that you believe them when they deliver sappy dialogue about how beautiful the other is helps you accept the tone of the film as a whole. Lionel Barrymore gives a performance that has weathered the 81 years since this film was released rather well as he is cantankerous and lovable all at once. Spring Byington managed an Academy Award nomination for her supporting role as Penny and she is deserving because she's absolutely luminous as the dancing sister who just can't help herself.\n\nDespite the powerful screenplay and performances this is Frank Capra's show as his usual style is applied to a story about a \u00ef\u00bf 1/2~little people' that is wildly and pleasantly sentimental. There is such a warmth to his direction as each scene naturally flows into the next and the film never really reaches a fever pitch but remains disarmingly appealing for 2 hours. He won the Academy Award for Best Director, his third and final, which I really appreciate because quieter films like this generally don't get rewarded as they should.\n\nThis film never matches the perfect opus that is It Happened One Night (1934) but no film could and this is still better than the majority of films released in the 1930s and has aged remarkably well. When considering 1938 as a year in film it wasn't particularly strong, especially when considering the fact that it was followed by the greatest year in cinema history: 1939, therefore I believe that the Academy chose the rare Best Picture winner correctly. If you like classic films then this will suit your needs perfectly as it features some of the biggest stars of the time and possibly the greatest mainstream director of the 1930s doing some of their best work at a point in time where there was still a large audience for this type of film.",

It was well paced, full of wit and developed a natural bond between its leads. YCTIWY is more than 2 hours long, and I don't think it got a more than 1 or 2 earnest laughs out of me. It feels like a funny script was written, then the jokes were removed, and they filmed what was left. It's implausible and, even worse, hypocritical. It preaches against wealth, yet the leads live in a big house, and no one seems to have much of a job, so how do they get by? It wants to constantly remind us that family and friends is what's important and money doesn't matter. So remember everyone, the next time you need groceries, go down to the supermarket and try paying in family and friendship. Exactly. I loved Jimmy Stewart, because its nigh impossible not to love Jimmy Stewart, but he's not given a lot to do, and I couldn't help feeling that the film would have been much more effective fi we could have seen the love interests meet for the first time, and spend more of the film with them, rather than constantly enduring the antics of the wacky Vanderhof family. It feels like a modern-day rendition of A Christmas Carol, only without the ghosts, and its ironic that the thing people love about it most, what made me enjoy it the least.",

In order to clinch his next deal his company, Kirby & Company, is buying up all the properties in a neighbourhood.  Everyone has sold, except one.  Martin Vanderhof won't budge, not for any offer.  He is happy where he is, living with his daughter, son-in-law, two granddaughters, grandson-in-law and a few other people in a community largely free of life's pressures.  Mr Kirby's son, Tony, is a new-appointed Vice President of Kirby & Company and is in love with his secretary, Alice Sycamore, Mr Vanderhof's granddaughter.  Their relationship, and the property issue, puts the two families, the Kirbys and Vanderhofs, on a collision course.  It's more than a clash of families but a clash of outlooks, ideals and what's important in life.\n\nDirected by Frank Capra who later went on to direct It's A Wonderful Life.  Like It's A Wonderful Life, You Can't Take It With You has a warm, fuzzy, sugary-sweet yet noble and liberating central message.  In It's A Wonderful Life, Capra surrounded that message with a wonderful plot, beautifully and sensitively executed.  With You Can't Take It With You, the execution is flawed, to the point that it negates the message.\n\nFrom the beginning of You Can't Take It With You there is a folksiness and raw, na\u00efve idealism that makes the movie seem more like a children's fantasy than profoundly-themed adult drama.  No subtlety at all and it only gets worse once we meet the collection of oddballs in the commune.  They were meant to provide light entertainment but for the most part they are silly and irritating.  Particularly irritating was the Russian guy.  I presume his schtick was meant to be funny, but really he is just an obnoxious dickhead.  Xylophone guy was also pretty bad - pretty much a rednecked simpleton.\n\nSo, little to no engagement with the \"good guys\" of the piece.  Add to this the fact that Capra draws Kirby as a pretty much stereotypical, one-dimensional heartless villain and we have a movie with little in the way of character depth.  In fact, I was so disengaged, the more silly the \"heroes'\" antics became, and the more Capra turned Kirby into a cartoon villain, the more, out of a sense of rebellion, I rooted for Kirby!\n\nEnding can be spotted a mile off, the movie is that predictable.\n\nThankfully Capra didn't try to duplicate the formula when he made It's A Wonderful Life.",

Though it brims with loud personality - new faces pile in by the fistful each time we visit the house - there's a shocking level of character development at play here. That can be partially attributed to its roots in theater, and the associated volumes of dialog that are breathlessly peppered in, but I think just as much credit must go to the actors, who commit wholeheartedly to their roles (no matter how silly) and smoothly grant fast, earnest credibility. Stereotypes abound in the plot, from the sinister banker looking to tear down a merry little village to the happy-go-lucky grandpa who's always got the perfect sentimental speech prepared, but that legitimacy of character (plus the film's age) makes it all feel like a natural fit. And really, don't some themes ring eternal? A true classic that warms the heart and reminds us to slow down and ensure we're still getting all we want from life.",

The Best Picture win gave him five of the six Oscars he would win, he would win an Oscar for Best Documentary in 1943.  In his film career, Capra made \"rags to riches\" stories about self-made men, and in tune with his political beliefs (he was a lifelong Republican who opposed Roosevelt's New Deal programs), were entirely made without the assistance of government.  His characters were the common man up against those who are greedy.  His films often had a moral character to them as well relying upon the goodness in human nature, the value of unselfishness and dedication to hard work and feel-goodness of his films led film critics to refer to many of his films as \"Capra-corn\" or \"Capraesque.\"\nThe film begins with Anthony P. Kirby (Edward Arnold), a shrewd businessman, returning to New York after a trip to Washington, D.C., where he notifies his staff that his plan is in motion to become a munitions monopoly won't be interferred with by the government.  Kirby realizes the threat of war and the possibility of making millions.  His plan can only be realized if he is able to put a competitor out of business.  He plans to do this by buying up a 12 block radius around his competitor, he is notified that there is one holdout, Grandpa Vanderhof, a kind, old gentleman played by Lionel Barrymore.  Kirby gives explicit orders to his real estate broker to make him sell his property by any means possible, even force if necessary.  The real estate broker John Blakely (Clarence Wilson) is a stressed out man with an eye twitch, who is denied his commission until Vanderhof sells.  Kirby's son, Anthony Kirby, Jr. (James Stewart), called Tony, falls in love with stenographer Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur), who is Vanderhof's granddaughter, and proposes marriage to her.  Unbeknownst to everyone is that this is the house that refuses to sell.\nTony and Alice come from different worlds.  Alice came from a family where her grandfather stopped working in order to have fun and taught his family to value fun over anything else.  Tony has been brought up in a banker's family told that he will be a banker.  Alice's family is much more accepting of Tony then his family is of them.  Capra has always shown the upper class to be snobbish towards the everyday working class in his films.  Alice comes up with an idea, she asks Tony to invite his family to her house to meet her family.  The families are so different and contrast each other.  The Sycamores are a madcap mischivous bunch just trying to enjoy life in the simplest of terms.  The Kirbys are stiff, snobby and absolutely uncomfortable and embarrassed to be out of their elements in the Sycamore home.\nDuring the first meeting between the families, everything that could go wrong goes wrong.  The police comes to question them about leaflets they have been printing going into the granddaughter's Love Dreams cookies that say things like \"Watch out for the Revolution\" and \"The Red Flag is sweeping the country.\"  The police come to the conclusion that they are Communists and suddenly dozens of fireworks go off.  Now the Kirbys and Sycamores are locked up in the drunk tank in the local jail.  The film leads up to a courtroom scene that shows Kirby starting to have a little change of heart, though his wife isn't exactly warming up to the idea.\nLionel Barrymore is absolutely delightful as the kind grandpa Vanderhof.  He steals the show amongst a great cast.  The movie has some great moments, but it has a slow pace.  It builds up for two hours to an unsatisfactory ending.  It's a bit more dated than other great Capra films like \"It Happened One Night,\" \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" and \"It's a Wonderful Life.\"\nKirby may have all the money in the world and all the power, but as Vanderhof points out to him, he has no friends.  What's all that wealth worth?  You can't take it with you when you're dead.",

This film does just that and does it to perfection.\n\nIt stars James Stewart but the entire cast is incredible.  Stewart is very young and in the early stages of his career so the rest of the actors really nail each and every scene they are in.  In particular, Lionel Barrymore has about as good as of a performance you can have and the entire Vanderhof family gets their time to shine.  Much like It's a Wonderful Life, this film is not only very enjoyable, but it's highly re-watchable.  Capra does a great job of directing his actors to some of their best performances of their career, along with creating a unique household full of what is probably one of my favorite families in film history.  Everyone loves the Vanderhof's, and so do I.\n\nThe film is very light hearted and I can understand if people think it could be corny, much like It's a Wonderful Life, but I don't think there's anything wrong with having a story that everyone can enjoy.  It's the classic tale of Romeo and Juliet/Cinderella but it's told and structured in a unique way that really hits home.  It's a predictable but really sweet script that plays out just that way on screen.  I love everything about You Can't Take it With You.\n\n+Sweet story\n\n+Everyone in the family is interesting\n\n+Twist on the R&J story\n\n+Barrymore carries the film\n\n10/10",

The whole main house does whatever they want to do and they live in a nicely furnished house with very little to want for. In real life, the tortured artist is a reality, you go broke following a passion without a Medici backing you up. As Mike Rowe would say, bring your passion where you go, rather than blindly following it, though no one would go amiss using their spare time for amusement and following dreams. It is true however, as the film says, that blindly trying to cut out the feet from all competitors, thinking you are better than everyone else because of your financial station, and solving all of your troubles with money will leave you friendless and with nothing at the grave. A happy medium would probably be better taken, or using the funds of the wealthy to, as a Medici, fund innovation and efforts to help the less fortunate. I love Jean Arthur and Jimmy Stewart and the whole rest of the cast (who can almost universally be found in It's a Wonderful Life, barring Arthur), but instead of hitting a note of inspiration, the film tries too hard to placate the dreams and notions of actors and artists and inventors. These are not bad people of course, but their kind of work leaves plenty of empty mouths when they don't go anywhere, and there are many working in Hollywood fast food right now trying to make it into the movies that never will. As the character Kolenkhov noted, he got paid and fed by teaching Essie how to dance, but frankly, she stinks and will never get anywhere. Often I feel this is the route of the college, fill the heads of students that they have talent, and so we feed and pay university teachers and deans, but really they know deep down that unless we win a life lottery, our degrees are worthless. I thought the film itself didn't drag and was fun, but by taking such a contrasted liberal view, they, as the character Kirby Sr. related, used emotional arguments that fell flat against the logic of reality.",

            "content": "PART OF MY CLASSIC VIEWINGS OF 2014 LIST\r\n\r\n\"Lincoln said, \"With malice toward none, with charity to all.\" Nowadays they say, \"Think the way I do or I'll bomb the daylights outta you.\" \"\r\n\r\nOut of all the film directors in the history of Hollywood cinema, there's never been a director that hasn't been as uplifting as Frank Capra. His films might feel a little corny in today's standards, but even so, with films like It's a Wonderful Life and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, you can't deny that Capra's uplifting stories of peace, happiness, and the joys in life are just timeless. But I've also known Capra for over-sugarcoating it a bit in his messages, which was why I wasn't that crazy over It Happened One Night. So when it came time for my experience with You Can't Take it With You, a comedy that, like It Happened One Night, won Best Picture (known for beating out The Adventures of Robin Hood, one of the greatest adventure films of all-time) and was a massive success among Great Depression struggling audiences, I was a little hesitant of whether I was going to like this film or not, especially since I disliked one of his most acclaimed films. But the good news is, You Can't Take it With You is not overrated in any way, but instead, an optimistic, funny, and heartwarming Capra classic.\r\n\r\nThe film is about the Sycamore family, headed by Grandpa (Lionel Barrymore), a former businessman who gave up the riches of life in order to focus on what truly matters, and by doing so, the rest of the family does what they desire to do in their own house, and are always optimistic even in hard times. His granddaughter Alice (Jean Arthur), the only one that feels \"normal\", has a job as a secretary at a highly successful bank, headed by the wealthy Anthony Kirby (Edward Arnold), who intends to make his son Tony (Jimmy Stewart) the next president in the company. Tony ends up falling in love with Alice, and in doing so, meets her kooky and eccentric family. But the hardest part comes when Tony invites his parents to meet Alice's family, and things then get super complicated.\r\n\r\nWhen I first turned the movie on, I didn't know what to expect with You Can't Take it With You. After being seriously disappointed with It Happened One Night, I almost gave up with watching more Capra films outside of Wonderful Life or Mr. Smith. But hey, the film had Jimmy Stewart, Jean Arthur, and Lionel Barrymore, who were great in other fantastic Capra films, so I decided to try out another Frank Capra, and I was impressed. \r\n\r\nFirst off, the comedy is great, more so than the dated humor in It Happened One Night. When we first get a good look at the eccentric Sycamore family, I knew this was going to be an entertaining film, and I was right. Scenes in the house were certainly the laugh-out-loud funniest, from Lionel's reasoning for why he doesn't believe in income taxes (to an IRS agent), the firecrackers in the basement, the Russian ballet instructor, and especially the reactions of the Kirby's when they come in the door. A problem I had with It Happened One Night was that the film turned into oober-cheesy melodramatic territory that made the film feel sugarcoated, artificial, and dated than what Capra was trying to make. The film does go dramatic in its final act, but unlike It Happened One Night, Capra's message about eternal optimism and the simplistic, laid-back approach of life can still appeal to today's faster-paced world like it did to the original audience that was still struggling to get by in the Great Depression.\r\n\r\nWith a strong cast like Jimmy Stewart, Jean Arthur, and Lionel Barrymore, I knew that these three talented stars can impress in a motion picture, especially when they have appeared in other great Capra films (Stewart being in this, Mr. Smith, and Wonderful Life; Arthur being in Mr. Smith; Barrymore being in Wonderful Life). The best when it comes to acting in this one is Lionel Barrymore as Grandpa. His laid-back approach to humor and life is something I haven't seen before in a motion picture (Cars doesn't count, cause that's a cartoon, but its similar message is still original for an animated film). Jimmy Stewart, Jean Arthur, and Edward Arnold are great in the more dramatic moments on the film, with the most effective being the moment where Jimmy reveals his real thoughts to Arnold.\r\n\r\nYou Can't Take it With You is a film that I was surprised that I would really enjoy. It's comedy is effective, the optimistic message still carries out to today's time, the acting is flawless, particularly Lionel Barrymore, and the film confirms the fact that Frank Capra is a great classic filmmaker. I will definitely attempt to watch more films from Capra now after enjoying this film, as I still need to watch films like Arsenic and Old Lace and Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.",

If you do, you're a dull-witted fool, Mr. Kirby. And a poor one at that. You're poorer than any of these people you call scum, because I'll guarantee at least they've got some friends. While you with your jungle and your long claws, as you call 'em, you'll wind up your miserable existence without anything you can call friend. You may be a high mogul to yourself, Mr. Kirby, but to me you're a failure - failure as a man, failure as a human being, even a failure as a father. When your time comes, I doubt if a single tear will be shed over you. The world will probably cry, \"Good riddance.\" That's a nice prospect, Mr. Kirby. I hope you'll enjoy it. I hope you'll get some comfort out of all this coin you've been sweating over then!\"\n\n[offering grace] Quiet, please, quiet! Well, sir, here we are again. We've had quite a time of it lately, but it seems that the worst of it is over. Course, the fireworks all blew up, but we can't very well blame that on you. Anyway, everything's turned out fine, as it usually does.

The reason why it isn't successful is because there's no way the Sycamore family could function the way they do. None of them have jobs, so how is it that they're all living great in a large apartment in New York City? And why did it take so long for Grandpa Vanderhof to be arrested for tax evasion? The list of improbabilities goes on and on. Of course, none of this should matter because of the film's overall message, which is incredibly sweet, but it does. The outcome of 'You Can't Take It with You' would be entirely different if realism was taken into account, but seeing as the film is essentially a fantasy that was designed to appeal to an audience looking for hope in a time of depression, I can't fault its creators for making it schmaltzy. Capra made it with the best of intentions and it shows, but in today's time, the whole thing just seems kind of ridiculous.",

            "content": "Alright so finally I get to the last best picture winner to review from the 30's. So let's finish this decade with You Can't Take It With You.\n\nPlot: Tony is the son of a wealthy banker, Anthony P. Kirby who has fallen in love with his secretary, Alice. Alice tries to arrange to have Tony's parents meet her eccentric family, but they all find out that her grandfather, Grandpa Vanderhof is the person responsible for stopping Anthony from destroying his neighborhood for a large deal.\n\nThis movie is kind of hard to review because it's definitely one of the very nice, very charming kind of films that are a little hard to find anything particularly unlikable about it. While it can be a little slow and more or less predictable at what happens at the end, it's for the most part a light and simple film with charming characters, a great cast to perform them, some cute comedy that's rarely used but is still done pretty well, and a good fun simple story all around. The most notable actors/characters are Lional Barrymore as Grandpa Vanderhof with his optimism, wit and wisdom, (though I can't believe that's the same guy that plays Mr. Potter in It's A Wonderful Life), Mischa Auer as Kolenkhov mostly because of how her delivers his lines for whenever he says that something stinks, and of coarse James Stewart as Tony. Why? BECAUSE IT'S FRICKING JA-...you know what? Most of you regular viewers out there have probably read my review for The Greatest Show on Earth, so you know how I feel about the guy. Anyway, the only real complaint with this film that some people seem to have is how it's message can seem preachy. And I can see why people would feel that way with how it plays a bit more into the 'money can't buy you happiness\" kind of theme more or less, but for the most part, that's what make this film so simple, it leaves a good message that is a cliche today but isn't necessarily less important then it was back them it came out. Plus they told it in a rather unique way considering how particularly eccentric the Vanderhof family are, and that's a good thing to have I think with such a message.\n\nAnd that's my review for You Can't Take It With You. Even if it's somewhat slow and predictable and has a message you've probably hear before, it still has a fun cast, with unique characters, and a story that make this a nice, simple enjoyable film to watch.",

I'm essentially politically aligned with Capra's left-wing compassion, but the characters seem more motivated by the director's political arguments than they are motivated by specific characterizations or the story's demands.  \nI also found the antics of the Sycamore household ridiculous.

This is a timeless story, as relevant today as it was in 1938. It bravely tackles the pitfalls of Capitalism and the greed it feeds. This is a story of one family that throws out modern ideas of success and lives for the moment with spectacular humour and life!\r\n\r\nThe horrendous greed of banks is once again causing havoc in the West. Banks and commercialism dictate whether we are successful as in 1938.  Power is corrupted, life is dulled and peace and happiness are left in the sticky hands of those with the means to enjoy life without having to work menial jobs just to look the part.\r\n\r\nBut then there are people like the Vanderhofs who refuse to play the modern game and instead live out their days doing exactly what they want. Grandpa Vanderhof (Barrymore) is under pressure from banker, Anthony P. Kirby (Edward Arnold) to sell his house so the developers can move in and build an ugly old warehouse producing goods, increasing their wealth! Grandpa stands his ground refusing all attempts of bribery, holding on to his way of life.\r\n\r\nEnter Alice, the Vanderhof granddaughter. She works for Kirby Jnr (Stewart) and they are madly in love. Here the fireworks literally start flying as the two families collide; one wildly weird with all kinds of eccentricities and the other prudish and materialistic. A huge dose of humility, humiliation and perspective gets thrown into the mix and you have a story and a half.\r\n\r\nThe characters make this film. And I'd like you to meet (most of) them. Grandpa is father of Mrs Sycamore (a budding amateur playwright), Mr Sycamore (plays with fireworks), Essie Sycamore (granddaughter, sister of Alice and try-hard dancer = hilarious), she is married to Ed (who seems to spend all his time playing the xylophone and peering out windows), two servants, a few more tinkers (who work in the basement on all kinds of STUFF) and the dance teacher Boris Kolenkhov (Essie's teacher who only comes to the house for the food).\r\n\r\nAdd to this list the Kirby family who bring their wealth, their power and their manners. These contrasting characters serve a greater purpose than simply humour. It is a comment on the western world; how money consumes us and puts us on unhappy paths where we no longer do what we enjoy, rather, we get bored to death in order to serve the mighty dollar. In the end, as the title suggests, you cannot take all this stuff with you!\r\n\r\nOn the whole this is a highly entertaining and soulful film. My favourite scenes were: the child band in the park (cool kids with cigars demanding a dollar for their services - including some crazy dancing), Alice sliding down the bannister in front of her future in-laws, the restaurant scene (classic slapstick), the russian dance teacher wrestling Kirby Snr. These are just a few. You must see this movie. It is beautiful, funny, deep and ultimately satisfying!!!!!!\r\n\r\nYou Can't Take It With You Trivia:\r\n\r\n* Budget - $1.5 Million dollars\r\n* This film is based on the Pulitzer winning play by Hart and Kaufman\r\n* Lionel Barrymore was suffering from severe arthritis during the shooting of this film which is why he uses the crutches. He had to have injections every hour to help with the pain. Poor Grandpa!!!\r\n* Ann Miller, who played Essie, was only 15 years old and cried after every take as the dancing took its toll on her body. James Stewart sent her chocolates to make her feel better. Sweet!\r\n* Frank Capra (Director) shot the film in 2 months and used over 41 times the amount of film",

I enjoyed the film, but it's overrated, and maybe not necessarily deserving of Best Picture. The problem is not the message or the acting from an excellent cast (which includes a delightful Lionel Barrymore), but the execution. The first half is slow, meandering, and thigns don't really pick up or get interesting until the latter half. Even then, the film is predicatble, and doesn't really do anything new or groundbreaking.\n\nHowever, it is still pretty entertaining, well-meaning, and humorous, so, despite it's flaws, it's an old fashioned feel-good film worthy of a watch.",

            "content": "You Can't Take It With You is a screen adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Broadway play by Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman. It centers on the Sycamore household headed by Grandpa Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore), a former businessman who proclaims that he once went up the elevator and then proceeded back down because he realized he never had any fun in that kind of life. In the household, everyone pretty much does what they please. Grandpa's daughter Penny Sycamore (Spring Byington) has become a novelist because someone mistakenly delivered a typewriter to to her home. Penny's husband Paul Sycamore (Samuel S. Hinds) makes firecrackers in the cellar with the help of Mr. DePinna (Halliwell Hobbes), an iceman who showed up one day at the doorstep of the Sycamores and never left. Their daughter, Essie (Ann Miller), is an amateurish ballet dancer who thinks of her dancing skills very highly, although her Russian teacher, Boris (Mischa Auer), expresses his thoughts of her skill as a simple phrase, \"it steenks!\" Essie's husband, Ed (Dub Taylor), is man who would much rather play his xylophone than work, spends most of his free time selling Essie's candy, wrapping each package in paper that is from a used printing press that dispenses anarchic slogans. The other daughter, and probably the most sane person in the entire household is Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur) who is in love with the wealthy Tony Kirby (James Stewart). Tony proposes to marry Alice and decides to have his parents meet hers for dinner one night. Naturally, when the two families meet each other, the event is a disaster, eventually leading to the arrest of everyone in the household because Grandpa Vanderhof has not been paid his taxes.\n\nBecause Frank Capra has become more well-known for the fact that he directed It's a Wonderful Life, Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, and It Happened One Night, You Can't Take It With You has become a sort of minor classic. Although it isn't deserving of that title. It's much much better than it suggests. It has it's own charm and is quite often funny, it also has as much pathos and sentiment as Capra's later masterpiece It's a Wonderful Life. The script is very well written and it also has some of Frank Capra's best direction; his Oscar for Best Direction was very well deserved, the dinner scene and the courtroom scene were both excellent. The film also has many of the finest comic actors of the time including Spring Byington, Dub Taylor, and Mischa Auer. It also has two of the finest dramatic actors of the time in James Stewart and Lionel Barrymore. One thing that makes seeing this film interesting after having long ago seen It's a Wonderful Life is that Lionel Barrymore, who plays the sympathetic character Vanderhof, would later play the villainous Mr. Potter, a character very similar to Edward Arnold's character in You Can't Take It With You. I much rather prefer Barrymore in this film than It's a Wonderful Life but one can't deny that Potter is one of the screen's greatest villains. Along with It's a Wonderful Life, Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, and Mr. Deeds Goes To Town, this is one of the films that truly defines the adjective \"Capraesque,\" the definition of the \"American Dream.\" It's a film that I very much recommend watching. It's a great romance and a great screwball comedy that I think most will find it hard to not enjoy. 10/10",

Both are afraid to have their families meet and sadly for them, it happens, with nasty consequences. The art direction, the toys, and the chaos scenes in the restaurant, Arthur's house, and courtroom are quite good. The acting also is good and it is worth the watch. I just wish it was a little shorter. The other interesting thing is that Anne Miller, who is most well known for the musical \"On the Town\" was only fifteen in the film and she was already married, which was interesting casting from the producers. Overall, a nice film. You can tell that this film paved the way for Capra's other famous works \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" and \"It's A Wonderful Life.\"",

This comedy also improves on the acting as it moves along, and with famous stars like James Stewart (a scary young James Stewart) and Lionel Barrymore, shame on me for doubting them.\r\n\r\nThis movie does improve in it's directing as well. At first it's on set design and filming style was a bit too cliche for me, but as the story evolved, so did the directing. More in depth shots started so arise to capture the emotions of the characters in great ways.\r\n\r\nThis movie was one that took me by surprise. It's only for people who love the classic movies, but this movie has a great charm to it if you let it sink in.

            "content": "In the 30s and 40s no filmmaker captured the essence of Americana like Frank Capra.  His films were the very epitome of the triumph of the human spirit especially when intertwined with great adversity.  During his illustrious career he won three Oscars for his direction, and two of his films won the coveted Oscar for best picture.  He was a bold representative of a time in Hollywood when films did not need to be dark and foreboding to be considered award quality, and he capitalized on that notion with style and grace.  YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU is easily one of his most memorable and greatest achievements.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i51.tinypic.com/2w53p00.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nBased on the Pulitzer Prize winning play by Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU tells the story of the eccentric Sycamore family and their grandfather and ringleader, Mr. Vanderhof.  More than 30 years prior Mr. Vanderhof was a successful business man who abruptly left his office one day in order to have some fun with life and never returned.  His passion and free spirit became a staple in his household, and now all the Sycamores spend their day doing whatever they please.  Penny, Vanderhof's daughter, writes novels because someone delivered a typewriter to the Sycamore house by mistake 8 years ago.  Her husband, Paul, makes fireworks in the basement with family friend and resident Mr. DePinna.  Their eldest daughter Essie dances around the house like a ballerina and makes fudge, and their youngest daughter, Alice, likes to slide down the banister into the great room on her way to work.  Worlds collide for the Sycamore family when a wealthy Wall Street banker wishes to buy their property and the surrounding properties in order to build a factory for the manufacture of weapons for the looming war in Europe.  Grandpa is the last holdout, and banker, A.P. Kirby will do whatever it takes to get him to sell.  Little does Mr. Kirby know, but his son and newest vice president, Tony, is dating Alice Sycamore.\r\n\r\nAs a stage play YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU is an absolute delight to behold.  I recently had the opportunity to see a wonderful professional production here in my home town, and it was an intensely gratifying experience.  Without the constraints of live theater, (the entire play takes place in the great room of the Sycamore household) the film is able to expand locations in order to flesh out detail only hinted at on stage.  Under these circumstances the film becomes an exciting and entertaining companion to an already entertaining play.  For me this really helped increase my satisfaction with watching the film, but mind you, you do not need to see the play to enjoy it.  Capra's skilled direction drives the story effortlessly from start to finish, never slowing down and never leaving the viewer wanting.  It is easy to see why he was so highly regarded in his day.  Lionel Barrymore is deliciously elegant as Grandpa Vanderhof.  He delivers his lines with emotion and picture perfect comedic timing.  (I must add an exchange between him and an I.R.S. agent about paying taxes as one of my favorite scenes of all time.)  For those of you who are fans of another Capra work, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, Barrymore's performance adds an interesting and stark contrast to his portrayal of the malicious and ambitious Mr. Potter.  Jimmy Stewart also shines as Tony, the bridge between the Kirbys and the Sycamores and the son of a wealthy man who has already learned that wealth isn't everything.  Stewart has always exceeded at capturing the essence of the everyman, and it is easy to see why Capra chose to work with him on several occasions.  He portrays Tony with warmth and class, and one can't help but see true love and devotion between him and Alice.  Jean Arthur is also exceptional as Alice, a woman who loves her family and loves her man and hopes that the two will find a way to meet in the middle through her.  All in all, expert direction, stellar performances, and emotionally uplifting storytelling make this film a treasure that should not be missed.\r\n\r\nYOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU is light-hearted but not a product of simpler times.  Keep in mind that the U.S. was caught in the grip of The Great Depression and Europe was on the brink of war.  With that in mind Hollywood was interested in audience friendly escapist fare, and YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU fits that need nicely.  Is it silly and unrealistic at times?  Yes, I can admit as much, but its central theme still resonates true to this very day.  \"Don't become so entrenched in the grind of daily life that you forget what's truly important.\"\r\n\r\nThat's my opinion, and I'm sticking to it.",

This is not the case with You Can't Take it with You, mainly due to the brilliant direction of Frank Capra, creator of Lost Horizon and It's a Wonderful Life. I didn't quite like the video version of the live performance, but I most certainly enjoyed this movie, enhanced with great performances, a flurry of high comedy, family drama, and genuine emotion, its Capraesque style, an expanded New York setting, and a fine story. The characters (most of them quirky people that live together at Mr. Vanderhoff's house) are just as colorful and full of personality as in the live performance, which was its best asset. But, maybe this film could've worked on its own without the IRS? And plus, it didn't quite get to the good stuff until an hour in.",

It feels self-aware, not as genuine or heartfelt as his best work and too often had elements that only managed to remind me of his superior work (It's A Wonderful Life especially). What happens to the Lionel Barrymore character is so obvious and improbable that it is laugh-inducing. You Can't Take It With You is not without laughs but, for Capra's standards, it fails. It is also depressing because of its cast, Jean Arthur in particular is spectacular in this. If she's not careful, she will become my favorite actress ever. Yes, I know there is nothing she can do about this since she's been dead for nearly 20 years. You know what I mean. And if you don't, pretend you do. Jean Arthur rocks.",

Set in NYC in the final years of the Great Depression, Capra takes a typical rich-poor mismatch and turns it into a poignant commentary on what is really important in life.  As the film's title suggests, there are more important things than those that society values.  You Can't Take It With You should cause you to do some self-reflection and assess your priorities, and that is a powerful accomplishment for a 72 year old film.",

In this film, the son of a wealthy banker wants to marry a girl who has a very strange family. The banker's family doesn't approve and the film deals with everyone trying to get along.\n\nStars in this film include James Stewart, Lionel Barrymore, and Jean Arthur. Considering the strong cast and the fact Capra was the director, I assumed I would enjoy this film. In actuality, I found this film very strange and most of the characters quite irritating. I didn't care about what was going on and you knew how it would end right from the start as that's how these kind of movies always end. After watching this film I can't believe it won best picture. Of the other nominees, I've seen two - The Adventures of Robin Hood which is a film I found more enjoyable but doesn't really seem best picture worthy either and Jean Renoir's Grand Illusion which is one of the greatest films ever made. No foreign language film has ever won best picture even today so it's no surprise it didn't win either.\n\n68/100\nD+",

What do taxes pay for? Schools, roads, public works that are keeping people in jobs. Hey you know when the fire department showed up to save your house from going up in flames???? INCOME TAXES THAT PAY FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT! \n\nI think this is the movie here Capra turned around for me. I love his early works- which were all slightly subversive and about having sympathy for the culturally  unsympathetic characters that stick in your craw afterward. This is the start of the over-sentimental Capra that most people think of when they think of him. Now, that's not to say I HATED the movie. Bright spots are for sure Jimmy Stewart who is young, funny, affable, and sweet. Jean Arthur is also quite sweet and natural in her role. If the movie had just been about those two I might have liked it a lot better.\n\nBut oh no, we get bashed over the head with a fairy tale \"free spirit money is super evil\" moral that sounds all well and good on the surface but lacks any real introspective in trying to find any happy medium between being happy and having friends but still having responsibility.",

Frank Capra's \"You Can't Take It With You\" won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1938, but I found it only slightly entertaining. There are some very funny and charming scenes, but there are far more that are quite flat. The film is also overly long, suffering from a terribly slack editing job. The direction I found to be predictable and pedestrian, and I didn't find anything special about the acting.\r\n\r\nIt's surprising to me that this film won the Oscar. Capra also won for Best Director. The Academy appears to have been excessively in love with Capra in the 30s. He was nominated for Best Director five times that decade and won thrice! He's probably the only director in history to dominate the Oscars for an entire decade. His films were also routinely nominated for Best Picture, although they only won twice (\"It Happened One Night\" is the other). \r\n\r\nThe storyline of \"Can't Take It With You\" focuses on a young couple (James Stewart and Jean Arthur, neither of whom were nominated for Oscars) who wishes to wed. However, he's from a wealthy upper-crust family, and she's from a family of modest means. As is often the case in 1930s films, class tensions abound; and of course the rich people are depicted as bad guys.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about the film is the girl's quixotic family. Every person in the brood is encouraged to discover his or her unique talents and live them to the hilt. A typical evening with this family involves one child spinning across the room in pirouettes, another playing the xylophone with passion, another showing off his latest invention, which usually involve fireworks, and Mom and Dad watching proudly. Music, art, and fun are everywhere. There seems to be an unlimited supply of money, despite the fact that no one works. That is of course never explained.\r\n\r\nThe family also attracts strays, people who couldn't make it in ordinary society. They join in the fun as well. When the film is at its best, it presents a shangri-la of joie de vivre. I was impressed by the fact that some of the hangers-on were black. It was quite radical in this time to cast black actors, and the producers deserve extra kudos for that.\r\n\r\nBut none of the characters have any depth. They are ultra-crude caricatures, and most of the time the zaniness is predictable. Capra doesn't do much more than give them a big set and have them prance across it.\r\n\r\nEqually predictable and shallow is the struggle between the families, which rides hard on every stereotype imaginable. Nothing original is brought to the table.",

The dialogue is snappy and clever, like many of the quieter comedies of its era, and is great fun to follow along with. The ending is a bit sappy but fairly satisfying. James Stewart, Jean Arthur, and Lionel Barrymore are all fantastic in their individual roles. And I have to say the family in question reminded me of my own at times. As fireworks go off outside the window, or a dance lesson takes place right in the middle of the sitting-slash-living-slash-dining room, everyone remains calm and continues doing their own thing.",

Of course Frank Capra is a genius.  There are many hilarious scenes, such as the scene where Alice and Kirby (I forget his first name) went to the restaurant and they meet the Kirby family.  But this movie also shows the problems in society back in 1938, which we still face today.  People are too worried about having a \"normal\" family, about how much money they make, and about being successful according to society's standards.  I love this film!",

And it's almost equally as good, which is really saying something.  If there is a flaw to this film, it's that it takes a little while to build up, but I hardly minded it by the time the film really hit it's stride (when Stewart's impossibly snobby parents met Arthur's wacky family).  When you really think about it, though, Stewart and Arthur's romance wasn't even the main story- that, I think, belonged to Lionel Barrymore (Mr. Potter?!) and Edward Arnold as Arthur's grandfather and Stewart's dad.  At the heart of 'You Can't Take it With You' is a story about enjoying life and choosing between doing what you want to do (\"having fun\") or what people say you have to do (\"having no fun\").  All in all it's a great and touching film, and totally deserving of it's place in history as a Best Picture winner.",

The film employed a little bit of the kind of off-beat, jazzy noir that has trademarked a whole range of superb efforts in the history of film as we know it. Orson Welles' Touch of Evil, Altman's The Long Goodbye, several pictures by the Coen brothers. You get the general idea. Furthermore, the dialogue and story-progression in Anatomy of a Murder is very strong and thorough. The beautiful camerawork lingers just the right time in each juicy scene. \n \nReleased in 1959, the film came out at an interesting crossroads in time where it was clearly still a classic, major Hollywood production, but had a bit of controversial, daring content: i.e. direct references to rape, and some use of similarly strong language, which was - although used in a clinical fashion - still subject to controversy, and certainly impossible to have been found on a major feature a few years earlier. \n \nIn the film, a washed-up attorney Jimmy Steward and his even more washed-up partner take up a murder case that gets ever more ambiguous at every turn. Each person's motivations and reactions are depicted commendably well. The score (and cameo) by Duke Ellington is also very excellent.\n \n---------\n \nWith that relatively lenghty review it's sad to say I have little energy left to comment on the rest of these films, each of which would deserve just as much praise, if not more.\n \n---------\n \n[b]You Can't Take It With You[/b].

The jury has to reach a unanimous decision. Luckily it seems like an open and shut case. NOT TO HENRY FONDA IT DOESN'T! 12 men, one room, one life at stake, lots of heat. A classic by Sidney Lumet.\n \n---------\n \n[b]Mr. Smith Goes to Washington[/b]. One U.S senate, one boy scout James Steward, one filibuster. Another electrofying classic from Frank Capra.\n \n---------\n \n[b]The Philadelphia Story. [/b]Katharine Hepburn in superb form. James Steward in superb form. Cary Grant in superb form.

Once James Stewart's character's parents show up, things change for the better with a good mix of screwball-ish comedy, and heartfelt sentiments.  As with Capra's other movies, he's unbridled his message with optimism, and he might be giving a simple answer to a complex problem, but it's hard to deny the power of the ending when Stewart's uptight father is shown that life is much more than money.",

Perhaps I've grown out of screwball comedies, but I am just not enjoying them lately - not \"Bringing up Baby\" or \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" or this film. Though it got some laughs, I found myself bored and irritated as well.\n   Tony Kirby (James Stewart) has fallen in love with his secretary, Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur). And now it's time to meet the family. His folks are as snooty as could be, wealthy bankers for generations. But hers are just plain eccentric. Led by Grandpa Vanderfhof (Lionel Barrymore), a harmonica-playing, stamp-collecting free spirit, the whole Sycamore family does just as it pleases. Alice's sister Essie (Ann Miller) is training to be a ballerina, under the tutelage of Boris Kolenkhov - who always manages to arrive at the house in time for dinner. Essie's husband Ed, a former college football player who likes to print Communist propaganda just for the fun of it, accompanies her on the marimba. Alice's mother spends her time writing plays, while her father has a fireworks factory in the cellar. And Mr. Poppins was just plucked out of an accounting job to become the newest member of the household, designing toys and masks. None of them seems to care about career or money, but they certainly don't lack for anything. When the Kirbies meet the Sycamores, there's bound to be a difference of opinion, to say the least. But whatever trouble comes their way - whether it by IRS auditors, arrests for disturbing the peace, or the prospect of having to sell their beloved house - the Sycamores face it all with joyful spirits. Happy endings abound, and the problems of the world are solved to the strains of \"Polly Wolly Doodle\" on the harmonica.\n   Of course, this being a Frank Capra film, there's always a message (and a crow, which makes multiple appearances). Here, the message is the same as always: be a good person, live life fully, do what you love, have as many friends as possible. Compared to \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" or \"It's a Wonderful Life\", I think Capra does a better job with his message without the screwball comedy. The problem is that whenever Capra gets serious, the film gets boring. The last 30 minutes, when all the realizations and character changes are being made, are a positive drag.\n   Still, there are more than a few interesting aspects to the film. For a start, it's almost disconcerting to see Lionel Barrymore playing the exact antithesis of Mr. Potter, the role he would become inextricably bound to 8 years later. Then there's Tony's great aspiration to design a working solar power engine, something we're still struggling with 70 years later. And I wonder how Grandpa's declaration that he won't pay income taxes until he's shown exactly where the money's going would be handled these days. The film's certainly not naive: there are plenty of mentions of the coming war and the lingering depression and the Communist threat. Also, for the year before Hattie McDaniel won an Oscar for \"Gone with the Wind\", this film has two very interesting roles for African-American actors - yes, they are the hired help, but at the same time, they are definitely part of the family. \n   So it's not that the film isn't funny and meaningful and well made - the acting and directing and writing are all in the right place. Stewart and Arthur do a fine job at romance and the characters and story are enjoyable. It's just that the film can't escape becoming a soapbox for ideals that have long since become passe - sad, but true.\n   Overall, an amusing screwball romantic comedy with a great cast and writing, but the pacing drags and the film is a bit too preachy for its own good.\n   [img]http://i567.photobucket.com/albums/ss112/medicatherine/you_cant_take_it_with_you.jpg[/img]\n[/size][/font]",

    "rt_summary": "Sweet-natured Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur) falls for banker's son Tony Kirby (James Stewart). But when she invites her snooty prospective in-laws to dinner to give their blessing to the marriage, Alice's peculiar extended family -- including philosophical grandfather Martin Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore), hapless fledgling ballerina sister Essie (Ann Miller) and fireworks enthusiast father, Paul (Samuel S. Hinds) -- might be too eccentric for the staid Kirbys."
