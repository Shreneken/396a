            "content": "It was an ongoing debate in my family if we should watch the movie or not. My mother is from Srebrenica and we lost a huge part of our family and amongst them my grandpa. The wounds are still open and will be no matter how long time passes and my mother's memories are still as vivid as if it was yesterday. Having seen a few bad movies left us not wanting to se another one on that subject because directors ( particularly Jolie) tried in a way to romanticize the war even though there is NOTHING ROMANTIC about that war. A huge loss, suffering and vivid memories of near friend and family being killed and tortured is something that my mother lives with daily. So I watched the movie first and later we saw it together. And it hits you to the core. I think that Jasmila Zbanic accomplished something great by leaving out horror scenes and making us just imagine. Because no scene can ever compare with the reality of crime and horrors that happened. In a few segments of the movie we had to pause because they felt so real to my mother that she started to look for my grandpa in the scenes with people outside the UN zone hq. We highly recommend everyone to see this movie and to never forget about Srebrenica.",

Damn, I was struck by it.The plot is real. That makes it even more devastating. They told the story in such a brilliant way that I had a little bit of hope every time Aida had a bit of hope. I would lose that, and regain that. Of course in the end I lost it for good. Another thing they did really well is the helplessness of the Dutch soldiers. I really felt like they couldn't do anything, and that made the feeling of hope and sadness and anger and all that, so much more real.The acting was terrific. I hadn't heard of any of the actors involved, and I actually kind fo like that. It makes it way easier to slide into the story, seeming as you don't associate the people you see with anything other than their role.I saw this film, I was devastated about the whole situation that was portrayed, and than like most people probably it went out of my head and I didn't think about it anymore, after 4 days or so. But then, 1.5 week after seeing it, a friend posted about not forgetting about this slaughter and that most people don't know about it and everything, and BAM, the whole film popped back in my head and I thought about it again. I shared it with my friend (who is part Bosnian) and it felt like a proper ending to my connection to this film, and I'll never forget about this tragedy again.",

A powerful, heartbreaking & devastating account of human injustice & global apathy, this Bosnian war drama is one of the best films of its year.Written & directed by Jasmila Zbanic, the drama centres around a fictional family in the middle of a real-life conflict but through their predicament, it effectively captures the utter despair & helplessness the refugees faced, not only from their persecutors but also from their supposed saviours. Zbanic lays bare the grave incompetence of United Nations whose lack of action only ended up enabling the wholesale killings.Zbanic makes sure the family the story focuses on looks & feels as real & authentic as possible, and the drama she conjures around them is compelling throughout. It's disturbing to watch UN delegates failing to do the one thing their organisation exists for and how they simply stood aside as mere spectators after letting the fox into the henhouse. Jasna Duricic leads from the front with an outstanding performance and she is strongly supported by the rest.Overall, Quo vadis, Aida is a brutal, harrowing & profoundly upsetting example of its genre that provides a scorching account of the lifetime of pain & trauma that warfare leaves behind and also exposes the failure & indifference of the international council that indirectly pave the way for such atrocities. Bringing the horrors of Srebrenica to screen with cut-throat intensity and leaving us shattered with its gut-punching finale, this Bosnian war film is essential viewing by all means. In a word, unforgettable!",

The UN promised that this would be a safe zone, but doesn't back up its ultimatums with action, leaving the small contingent of UN peacekeepers helpless in the face of stronger Serbian forces, who step-by-step get bolder, take over the town, and eventually the civilians seeking safety at the UN base.I saw this as a digital screening of the Toronto International Film Festival, with writer / director Q+A. The writer put together the story based on actual transcripts, together with survivor stories. Many were composited into the main character Aida. Aida is a translator for the UN troops, and she also tries to keep safe her husband and 2 teenaged sons,. Thus she could move between the \"defenders\" and the defended, and tell the stories of both.The characters are well-played and believable, and there are little touches that are illuminating: some flashbacks to pre-war life, a reference to neighbors turning against neighbors, etc. My one complaint is that, as a composite, some events seem to happen too quickly.",

            "review_title": "The Return Gaze of a Genocide",
            "content": "The Bosnian entry for the Best International Feature Academy Award, \"Quo Vadis, Aida?\" is better than the odds-on favorite to actually win the Oscar, \"Druk\" (a.ka. \"Another Round,\" 2020), being that it's actually about something that matters and is emotionally devastating--so much so that the eponymous Aida literally begs to make a Sophie's Choice at one point. The protagonists in both are teachers, and neither one ultimately affects any real change, but one is living history while the other rambles to high-schoolers about his famous favorite fellow drunkards. Both pictures are alienating: this one forcing us to witness the horrific Srebrenica massacre that we're unable to alter, and the other makes one feel like the designated driver to a bunch of binge-drinking dolts whining about their so-called mid-life crises. As opposed to waiting impatiently to drive the inebriated teachers home, however, \"Quo Vadis, Aida?\" does well to pull the spectator into the chaos. There's nary a dull moment in following Aida (as played rivetingly well by Jasna Duricic--seriously, Academy, you missed a nominee) around a makeshift UN refugee camp as she frantically tries to save the lives of her husband and two sons from the approaching slaughter by Ratko Mladic's Bosnian Serb Army and as the United Nations and their so-called, shorts-wearing peace keepers impotently stand by and refuse to help.I want to note, too, that Aida being a translator, or interpreter, as the case may be (that \"piano player\" as \"messenger\" part early on, e.g.), makes for an interesting dynamic in the subtitling of the picture, among other things--much of it disregarded as unnecessary because of it. There's actually a good deal of English here beside other languages. Another good reason for the Oscar category name change from \"Foreign Language Film\" to \"International Feature.\"Additionally, amid all that, writer-director Jasmila Zbanic and company also do something reflexively interesting cinematically. While the real war is nothing more than a one-sided genocide slaughtering Bosniak Muslim males, there's another battle here for the cinematic control of the narrative. On one side, there's Mladic with the cameraman he continually tells what to shoot, and who in return reassures the would-be convicted war criminal that he'll fix his inane monotony with montage. We never see that film here, though--only its making from the outside, where its propagandistic lies are all the more apparent. And, on the other side, we have the faces of the people in the outer, film proper that is \"Quo Vadis, Aida?\" We see this in intermittent series of return gazes--of people looking directly, or close to, at the camera and, thus, us, the audience. They're the victims of the genocide within the narrative and, as the case may be, interpreting the real tragedy onto the screen, but through these return gazes, seize control of the narrative. This is their movie.",

A mother, who's also an interpreter, tried to get her family to safety while the civilians were being transported by the Serbian force.Coming in, I didn't know anything about the real life story. However, after watching about 10 to 15 minutes, it was abundantly clear what was going to happen. For the rest of the movie, it became a desperate, maddening, and heartbreaking descend into the inevitable. This was shown through the lens of our main character, and her desperation was relatable, like if you were in her shoes you would do everything she did.The color and cinematography also heightened the desperation. The movie looked monotonous. The overwhelming color of the ground during the day felt hot, dry, and reflected the dire situation the civilians were in. Even more, the movie felt so raw, making me feel like I'm actually there with the people.And then the ending hit. I knew it was coming, but still I was in silence as the camera slowly moved away. There's no need for showing actual violence. Just the sound was enough to convey the horror. The last scene was a strong testament of the director about the unjust event.Overall, a devastating movie that i would not want to see again. 9/10.",

It's a gut wrenching, sensational film.Jasna Djuricic carries the entire movie as Aida, a U. N. translator who spends the entire film trying to use her minimal influence to keep her husband and two sons safe. The movie isn't about the Bosnian war in general but rather about the events leading up to a massacre in Srebenica. Substitute school buses for train cars and the whole episode was chillingly reminiscent of something you would have seen during the Holocaust. The movie is a matter of fact rendering of the desperation and chaos surrounding that terrible event, and it's refreshing to find a movie that knows its subject is powerful enough to speak for itself without needing to manipulate our feelings with a bunch of cinematic editorializing.In no scene is this choice more effective than the one that finds Aida wandering around a room with a bunch of other women who've been asked to identify piles of bones that used to be their male relations.And that last scene. Good Lord. I can't even imagine sitting at a school concert among the very men who murdered my family. It's movies like this that make me feel like I've literally never had a real problem in my entire life.Grade: A.",

Or better, it is a film that is able to portray the events of Srebrenica yet focus on the personal story of a handful of characters.The main character, Aida, is an interpreter for the UN military unit that was sent to Srebrenica in 1995, and is determined to save his all-male family from the butchery of their invaders. Her character is the center of virtually everything that is depicted, and allows to give a wide glimpse at the most recent genocide occured on european soil. While several of the main characters are invented, they interact at various points with really existing people: Mladic, the \"butcher of Bosnia\", colonel Karremans of the UN military division, among others.One element which I found relevant was how the film underlined the fact that the post-jugoslavian conflicts were a conflict between neighbours, between people who belonged to the same communities, and the epilogue depicts this in a most shocking way.",

My field of interpretation has never seen anything as severe as what the movie depicts. Nevertheless, it's an important focus on the sheer terror of the situation in 1990s Bosnia (although I doubt that any movie can fully show the horror of it).Definitely see it.",

            "content": "Films that depict a historical event are always such a tricky business. On the one hand, they can shed light on that event, and thus offer the audience education and information about events they may not have known, on the other hand, it happens again and again in film history that the events were distorted for the purpose of their own propagandistic ideology, at the expense of the individuals who experienced those events. These events are then given a dramatic narrative, which in itself (for many critics like Mr. Haneke) represents a moral dilemma. Is it allowed, or should it be allowed, to re-stage such historical tragedies at all? Even in the context of art, one should not extract moments of tension from certain real events in order to manipulate the audience into having an emotional reaction to these cinematographic elements.I understand this criticism, but I think that such a re-enactment of historical events can work, especially if it is done from a personal, artistically tasteful, non-commercial point of view. And this is exactly what Quo Vadis, Aida? Manages to do, in my opinion. Especially the feelings of tension and fear that are so masterfully brought out by Jasmila Zbanic's staging do not feel contrived and clich\u00e9d, but thoroughly human and sensitive.Quo Vadis, Aida? Could very easily have fallen into the category of classic Oscar bait, but the film offers us the complete opposite. Instead, we are presented with unadulterated moments of Bosnian genocide, moments of frustration and horror. Moments that remind us how cruel humanity can be. Overall, this is a war film that comes closest to the suffering of Come and See - cold, painful, inescapable. Yet always honest, emphatic towards those who suffer, and with such an unimpeachable staging elegance that is rarely seen in contemporary cinema.Influences that I could detect based on the film language were definitely traces of Villeneuve due to the visual iconographic elements - especially the camera work and lighting design. For a european film and considering the budget, the film looks operatic and massive, yet intricate simultaneously.It's a shame that Jasna Djuricic couldn't achieve more recognition at the various awards ceremonies, but we're already used to that. The performance will live on, and speaks for itself, it doesn't need a decorative yet ultimately unsubstantial trophy.",

The last genocide that the book extensively talks about, is of the Bosnian Muslims by the Serbians, at Srebrenica. This is set smack in the middle of that tumultuous time.*What I liked about it* - The pacing and the scripting. It is 100 minute long and packs so much in that century. The chief protagonist, Aida, a UN translator, might be the one of the most true flesh-and-blood characters written for screen. Her personal and professional battles form the crux. The UN soldiers, tasked with enforcing truce between the Bosnians and the Serbs and the Serbian warlords, intent on capturing the city and relocating its citizens are vividly drawn. The acting is so natural that you feel at times that you are watching a documentary, rather than a thriller.It reminded me of our very own _The Kashmir Files_ at times. The terror that you are being hunted just for your religious identity, is as real here, as it was there. The brutality, much of it off screen here, would make your fertile imagination churn up many scenarios. It is telling that this was sent to the Academy Award by the country whereas The Kashmir Files was reviled by a section of the intelligentsia and political class as conjecture and not fact based.This is a great film and is surely going to be seared in the memories of those who choose to watch it.",

            "content": "War movies so often glorify battle, downplaying the human cost. Dramas that unfold with armed conflict in the background tend to minimize the brutality at hand. 'Quo va dis, Aida?' is a film that pointedly zeroes in on that human cost, while also ensuring we get a clear picture of military involvement.Writer-director Jasmila Zbanic gives an unflinching portrayal, in a microcosm, of the Bosnian War, and the absolute terror it brought with it. At only 14 minutes into the duration we get a shot surveying a vast sea of refugees seeking entry to the United Nations base at Srebrenica, a scene that is instantly awe-inspiring and horrifying. From there the film mostly focuses on individual characters, specifically UN interpreter Aida (Jasna Duricic) and her family, yet the tension remains direly palpable.Zbanic gives stark focus to the glaring inhumanity of the invading Serbs under war criminal Ratko Mladic, the startling inaction of the UN - and the unconscionable slaughter of civilians. At every turn the film gives a vivid depiction of the Srebrenica Massacre, and the haunting power it still holds over all those whose lives were changed irrevocably. The sheer scale of the bloodshed is difficult to process. It's impossible as a viewer to not be deeply affected.'Quo vadis, Aida?' also inherently highlights just how appallingly little attention has ever been paid, overseas, to the conflicts in the Balkans. Whether one grew up in the 90s and only dimly gathered a sense of a war going on thousands of miles away, or spent a decade of adulthood consistently watching news, war in another corner of a world was little more than a footnote. Watching this feels like learning about an event, nearly 30 years past, for the first time. This speaks at once to the shameful inadequacy of media - but also the stunning potency of this feature.'Quo vadis, Aida?' and Jasmila Zbanic deserve every accolade they have been awarded, and more. It's not an easy movie to watch, but it's of the highest craftmanship - and essential, spotlighting a heinous moment in history that must not be forgotten, or repeated.",

I can see why he thinks Quo Vadis, Aida deserves a nod. It is shocking, brutal, emotional, suspenseful and confrontational in depicting the atrocities of war, and telling in terms of the failure of the UN to prevent a mass human genocide. The film is a tough, yet must-see, watch, and I think It will take a while before I can brace myself to go through another movie experience like this.",

Rwanda is one dark example and Srebrenica another with 8,000 men and boys slaughtered at the hands of the brutal Serbs.Shown from the perspective of a translator to the UN forces in Srebrenica, Quo Vadis, Aida, ramps up the tension as the Bosnians try to survive in the 'safe camp' manned by Dutch UN troops.The trains and cattle trucks of the Holocaust are replaced here by buses but the effect and consequences are the same.It is ironic that the international court of justice is based in the Hague, where the Serb war criminals were tried. Yet it was the impotence of the Dutch forces on the ground in Srebrenica that led to the massacre.The Serbs were clearly guilty of mass murder but the Dutch were culpable too for gross dereliction of duty.This is an important film and one that I hope as many people watch as possible.",

There are no good and bad guys here. Literally everyone under given circumstances is capable of committing such crimes. The question is (and always has been) whether we are ready to forgive (or at least neglect) and look ahead or wait the perfect time to hit back.

It is quite probable that right now a new generation of Bosnians who experienced those crimes are waiting their chance for revenge. This is the world we live in.

Its subtle direction and intricate psychological nuancing create a deep sense of dread and hopelessness in the viewer, as much as they do in the characters facing the brutal and primitive forces of war. The Serbian actors Jasna Djuricic as Aida, and Boris Isakovic as Ratko Mladic, are masterful in their portrayals of two opposing forces, that of a mother and wife powerless to protect her family, and that of an all-powerful warlord stage-managing his place in history.It is definitely Zbanic's best and most powerful film, even if its topic lends itself to a lot of side-conversations that take away from its undeniable artistic power.",

When the Serbian army takes over the town, her family is among the thousands of citizens looking for shelter in the UN camp.What this film shows to me , is how toothless the UN are and were during this war .The Dutch don't come out of this looking well but their hands were tied because those in authority were to reluctant to attack the Serbs.This is a subtle war film. Too subtle in my opinion .You never really see in graphic detail the atrocities that the Serbian army carried out and I think this needed some shock value to give it some impact .It's impressive how they got so many people to do the refugee shots at the camp and the performances from the cast feel very natural , especially Jasna Djuricic who played Aida.The thing I'll take most away from this film is that the Muslims knew their oppressors before the conflict , some were even friends , and those that survived had to mix with those same people after the war . The same people that may have have killed family members .The futility of war.",

It's so human, no heroic actions, no extraordinary characters that you would see in every Hollywood production. Even the typical Balkan hyper dramatization and \"overplay\" was missing here.It was so realistic, so well played. I even went and started to compare the scenes to the real footage and videos in youtube about those events and found the scenes horribly horribly realistic. You'll not see the \"glory\" of the war scenes or the naturalistic scenes of the atrocities as in the Holocaust movies but you will feel all those amazingly realistic emotions of anger, desperation, lack of power and confusion, expecting the inevitable horror and even... hope.There is another aspect of the movie I wish to highlight. We all watched all those great movies for the WW2 concentration camps but even if we feel sorry for the victims, the feeling that those are events of another time when the people were different, minds were thinking different and this so so fake feeling of security because \"it will not happen to me or my generation or in Europe again\", BUT here in this movie you'll take that cold shower that will wake you up.This is a movie to be watched to be lived through the screen.",

Is that even though it deals with the 1995 Serbian massacre in Bosnia-Herzegovina, she never dwells on the bloodshed itself. Rather, Zbanic is focused on the psychological toll, personified here by the title character, Aida (a superb Jasna Djuricic), a Bosnian interpreter for the United Nations.Aida, a schoolteacher by profession, is working at a U. N. camp in the supposed safe zone of Srebinica. As the Serbs close in on the facility, Aida's attention to her duties get increasingly distracted by the prospect of her husband and two military aged sons falling into enemy hands. Aida's struggle reflecting that of her people.Zbanic (who also the screenplay) gives her production an immediacy lacking in many a war story. The weakness of the U. N. personnel isn't presented as an abstract lack of political will, but she makes it palpable by focusing on the individuals in the camp. The horror of the situation similarly isn't shown on a grand scale, but, on a human one. The Serbian troops also aren't a faceless enemy. General Mladic (Boris Isakovic; Djuricac's real life husband) is an implacable foe - outwardly calm and yet menacing. He smiles as he lies. He smiles as he tells the dark truth. Djuricic's Aida represses her outward emotions as much as humanely possible under the circumstances. He inner turmoil building.In Zbanic's treatment, there can be no true catharsis for Aida, nor her fellow countrymen and women. Only steely determination. The title itself compels the viewer to consider 'Where are you going?\" It's not a question aimed at Aida - but, at the audience themselves.",

Especially because they did it on all occupied areas just like Nazi's did.I found especially difficult to watch the scene where UN is delivering Aida's children sticking to \"procedure\" while choosing to ignore their destiny just to save their own skin.It's almost unbelievable that this was happening in Europe on the end of 20th century while one could say that memories of ww2 are still fresh.All war criminals should be prosecuted regardless on nationality. All lives matter regardless on their nationality, religion or race.The end of the movie portrays that perfectly, where the war criminal has everything, a family and happy life (even Aida's apartment) while Aida has nothing and is \"forced\" to live only to hold the memory for her love ones she lost.Even though prosecution of the war criminal would not return her family but at least society would condemn this kind of behaviour and maybe it would make someone somewhere think twice knowing that even in war you are accountable for your actions.I also think that UN officers should have been prosecuted as well since their failed to fulfil their duty and protect the civilians.One can only hope that politicians (all ex yu nations) will finally stop twisting history for their personal gain and let people to heal and start living their lives far from hatred.",

            "content": "\"Quo vadis, Aida?\" (bad title already with the pseudo-important Latin and Aida being mentioned instead of Srebrenica) is a relatively new movie and I will not list all the countries of production here because it is simply too many. You know where to look that up. The most frequent language is Serbo-Croatian, but there are many others as well, so chances are close to 100% that you will need subtitles for the watch here. If you want to watch. You probably shouldn't, but I will get to that later. You can already see it from my rating. The writer and director is Jasmina Zbanic. She started making films, i.e. Short films, back in the final years of the new millennium, so she has been active in the industry for over 20 years now. This one here, however, is her big breakthrough you could say and it also resulted in her being given the chance to direct an upcoming episode of the new television series The Last of Us that is based on the really successful video game with the same name. Anyway, we are not talking games or series today, but movies. Zbanic is a filmmaker who usually comes up with her own scripts, so no surprise she did here and she also scored two BAFTA nominations thanks to this movie. The film runs for minimally over 100 minutes, so not a particularly short film, but also really not too long and I am glad about that. The latter I mean. This is book-based by the way and the one who inspired this film was Hasan Nuhanovic and maybe you have come across him somewhere in the documentary genre already. The woman you see in the center of the film is the one you also see on the poster here and her character Aida is also mentioned in the title of the film, probably in pretty much every international title too. The actress is Jasna Djuricic, who started acting around the same time her director and writer here started making movies, so also over two decades ago already. Zbanic is almost a decade younger though.The rest of the cast I cannot say too much about. Most actors are Eastern European, but the international impact of the story also results in performers from other countries. The actors are not the problem though, at least not the supporting actors. There are many films out there with unknown actors that are still really good and sometimes also really successful despite a cast without big names. They are also doing a solid job for the most part and it's probably my loss that I don't know them. I don't know lead actress Djuricic either, but this is not my loss I am sure. I thought she was majorly disappointing and offered two or three different face expressions from beginning to end. Basically, it is really all about her being and looking shocked as you also see it on the poster here on imdb. I mean her character sure has enough reasons to be and appear shocked, but it somehow felt awkwardly wrong from beginning to end. She deserves major blame, but major blame should also go to Zbanic here for the writing. I think the scenes that did not feature the title character directly were sometimes okay, but when Aida was at the center of the story, which she was sadly way too often, it was a weak, sometimes even terrible watch. This refers mostly to those scenes where they present her to us as desirable, wonderful and amazing and in a way where every woman should want to be her. It reminded me of female characters on ARD Degeto films. Maybe German readers know what I am talking about here. This is also a German co-production by the way.I will mention some scenes and examples where this film really hit rock bottom when it came to depicting Aida. I mean I agree that we are in need of more female-led movies with strong women characters, but this is absolutely not it. It all feels so gimmicky. Take a look at when we see her party with much younger woman and take part in a beauty (I think it was \"Best Hair\") competition and she looks so dressed-up all of a sudden with all this makeup too and yeah, it's of course very accurate realism and enough that she does not win... Everything else about that scene is of course also realistic, isn't it!? Then there is the scene when she is up there working as an interpreter and offers that she can do the job that the guy in charge wants from somebody else in the crowd. How she keeps talking to him, almost begging him and still implies she belongs with him and not with the people down there in terms of class and power and dignity. Then there is a doctor or something and he is of course pretty attractive and amazed by Aida when they talk to each other on a few occasions. Especially when he asks her what is next on her agenda. Romantic tension there and he clearly thinks she is an amazing woman. But she is of course married and faithful to her husband. She also brought up two boys that mean the world to her. Now men. And her response is that she wants to go back to teaching eventually because of course she is also an inspiring educator and dealing with kids and making an impression on them, preparing the next generation for the world comes easy for her. Then there is one scene in which we have three people walk together towards the camera and Aida is of course in the middle although the other two are much more important in terms of professions. Also all her negotiation moments felt so strange and just not authentic. In reality, she never would have done anything else really than used her linguistic talent, maybe (if at all) asked on one occasion to make a greater impact and that would have been it. The begging moment was also not good. The writing for once was not a key issue there, but the protagonist's overacting really was. Also a bit doubtful if she really knew what tragedy was coming her family's way as it it implied here.And what happened was the Srebrenica massacre, a genocide that happened back in the 1990s and this is when this film is set. We do not see people dying really, but we see guns fired almost at the very end. I must say this also felt a bit like the easy way out and I think this massacre deserves a much better movie to be honest. To me it almost felt like an insult to those killed and their relatives when we, right before the closing credits, read on the screen for whom this film was made. Whom it is dedicated to. I cannot accept it. It was a shoddy female character study for the most part. Here and there, as I stated earlier, it was okay and even a bit on the watchable side, for example when the soldiers basically want to get in there and check for weapons etc. When Aida is just a small character for once. That was okay and really tense too. But these moments where clearly not the rule. Almost everything else was just not on a high level. I have not read the book that inspired this movie, so I cannot say if the problem is there already or if it lies exclusively with the execution here. The ending was also pretty messy. I already mentioned the guns being fired. Actually, this could have made for a solid ending if the closing credits rolled in right there. Not a good one, but a solid one. But of course instead the movie must give us another unrealistic scene with how Aida ends up in an apartment and randomly runs into a former tormentor (by the way the one who kept hating against Muslims earlier if I remember correctly, what a fitting inclusion for a 2020/2021 release). What a coincidence! And in the desperate attempt to still make it a somewhat happy ending, we see her watching a performance including young people that shows us how despite her loss she did not lose her humanity and her believe that good will prevail. And that she focused on helping young people.Overall, I find it baffling how many people loved this film. Viewers, awards bodies and critics. It felt very shallow to me and not even close to bringing the emotional gravity that Srebrenica deserves. Let's be honest here. This film could have been entirely fictitious and still almost nothing would have changed. A true disappointment. You should watch a documentary instead. There is just too much wrong here. It's really a joke if you take a look at how all male characters are written. At best flirty, but really either cruel and ruthless or incompetent, but in any case not on par with how much of a strong woman Aida is. And how smart. I mean look at these inferior men telling Aida about younger and much more attractive women how they cannot deal with stupid women implying that Aida is of course leagues above those. Aida takes it the most humble way possible of course. She may be the best there ever was, but also she is of course as modest as it gets. Degeto alert once again. I suppose that you could say that how much you like (well \"like\" as I am not sure that is the right word given the tragedy in here) the film is closely linked to how much you care for the protagonist. I almost did not care for her at all because of the actress and how the character was written. This film was even nominated for an Oscar and maybe the only film with a minimal chance to upset the far superior Danish entry. I am truly glad it did not. This movie here is one you really wanna skip. Even if you are a bit of an Oscar completionist like myself, there are many, many others you should go for before checking this one out. I give it a thumbs-down, but who knows, maybe you are also one of the many who will like it. But as I just said, my suggestion is to go for a documentary instead of seeing this one and it's another bad thing probably that it will take many more years for another film on this subject with this (allegedly) good movie delaying things now because many filmmakers think they cannot come up with something better. Go for it, if you read this. I'm sure you can. For Srebrenica.",

            "content": "Quo Vadis, Aida? Is a compelling and very harrowing film that focuses on a translator for the UN at a camp with thousands of civilians whose lives are in danger, with her family among them. Most of the film concerns her trying to survive and keep her family alive while the Serbian army threatens to execute those who are seeking refuge.You're thrown into things very quickly as a viewer, but not in a way that's confusing. I had no idea about the history of this event, but the first 15-20 minutes expertly lay out what you need to know while wasting no time in getting to the core of the story. As such, it's very engrossing, and rarely lets up for its 101-minute runtime (and it felt ever shorter than that).It's excellently shot and the acting is great across the board. You understand what's going on and what's at stake extremely well, and it makes much of the film tense and emotional. While there's little to no on screen violence, the violence that happens off screen still has a great impact, and the threats and tension the characters face is always palpable.It's not afraid to criticise the UN for their role in things going out of control, and overall it condemns the way systems are set up to allow bad things to happen to ordinary civilians in a war setting, as well as the way that many can hold themselves not personally accountable for tragedy by blaming it on others, or by blaming it on the set of rules they \"need\" to follow because of the system they're under.Rules and regulations clash with common sense and humanity to devastating results, and that's what Quo Vadis, Aida? Puts across to viewers expertly. I suspect it's not going to be for everyone (maybe it was too much for the Academy, because as much as I like Another Round, this was the better film when it came to the nominated foreign films released in 2020), and it's not a movie I could see myself casually rewatching. But it was gripping and almost flawlessly made, with exceptional acting and pacing, and I can't imagine someone watching this and having it not leave at least some sort of impact.",

            "content": "As a work of art, \"Quo vadis, Aida?\" is a success. The cinematography is great, the acting is good to excellent, and the dialogue is adequate (more or less). However, when it comes to historical accuracy, things get complicated. Here are two examples that may seem trivial compared to the massive real-life suffering that served as the basis for the film, but still deserve mention because they misrepresent real individuals and events.1.) Much of the material involving General Ratko Mladic and the Bosnian Serb army is based on real-life video recordings (available on YouTube) made by Mladic's own cameraman. \"Quo vadis, Aida?\" recreates most of these scenes faithfully, with one glaring exception. In the scene where three civilians from the UN camp are sent to negotiate with Mladic, one of them, a 40-year-old woman named Chamila, is groped by a Bosnian Serb soldier as he hikes up her skirt while searching for weapons. In contrast, the real-life video clearly shows that the real Chamila was not frisked or touched at all by any of the soldiers.2.) As stated in the end credits, the film was \"inspired by\" a book written by Hasan Nuhanovic, a real-life translator at the UN base in Srebrenica. In fact, Mr. Nuhanovic was involved in the early stages of production, but withdrew due to disagreements over the fictionalized elements of the screenplay. One piece of dialogue to which Mr. Nuhanovic objects made its way into the final version of the film: After returning from the negotiations, Aida's husband, a fictional character based on Mr. Nuhanovic's late father (who took part in the real-life negotiations), has an argument with Chamila, and then says \"I can't stand stupid women!\" According to Mr. Nuhanovic, there is no evidence that such a dialogue took place in real life.In the film's defense, the opening credits clearly state that it is \"based on true events.\" Ultimately, \"Quo vadis, Aida?\" is worth watching, as long as you keep in mind that it's not a documentary.",

Instead, I will make a comparison with the Serbian Oscar candidate named \"Dare from Jasenovac\", who was described and declared as nationalist propaganda against I don't know who, Croats or maybe Ustasha and that's completely ridiculous when we have all that testimonies and documents that described Jasenovac as one of the worst nazi's concentrational camps where 700 000 people was brutally murdered including women and childrean. (Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and Croats).So, Jasenovac is a perfect example of genocide, and Srebrenica was an attempt at ethnic cleansing and a terrible war crime, and if you don't agree with me, I can't help you, especially because even UN confirmed that it was not genocide.It will be the biggest shame of great Serbian army, or at least a part of that army, and we'll had to deal with it as a country and as a society, just like Croats will have to give up Ustasha crimes, and Bosnians will have to give up Naser Oric crimes if we want to go forward.Bottom line, it's a great film and it's good that one film from the former country is a candidate for such a big award, even though we've all known that it's not just about movies for a long time, but also lobby for this or that.Good luck on 26th April !!!",

Sometimes the movie felt a littel campy with its forced imagery of dispair, but it was managable.Characters felt well performed and motives were clear. Acting was fine, not super great but more than enough to be passable. Some editing was jarring, but not too much that it made it offputting.All in all, great movie wich handles its subject very well, but as a standalone you can't really praise it the same.7/10: good good.",

Best is acting of Emir Hadzihafizbegovic, and was he there more, this would be more funny and interesting. Bit funny vulgar language and threats, which are funny in real life too, at least to me. Also important historic topic from my area, which shows bareness of human life, war, hunger, enemies, etc. This would be more relevant if made at least 10 years ago. Bit shallow but still authentic and bare killings of victims, meaning no gore as in better movies. So, I am neither amazed, nor disappointed, but satisfied.",

In Quo Vadis, Aida? We follow Aida, a teacher working for the United Nations as a translator in a UN protection camp with a thousand citizens. Thanks to her work, Aida believes that she and her family are safe from the genocide taking place outside the camp. However, she gets to feel in a brutal way that a war knows no justice.The plot always focuses on protagonist Aida (Jasna Duricic) and her iron will to bring her family to protection. Because no one is prioritized in such an exceptional situation, Aida often does not get what she wants. Yet she was hoping for exactly this consequence due to her special position as a translator. This results in some heated discussions and arguments with UN commanders and soldiers, who regularly refuse Aida's wishes. Duricic especially succeeds in this role in drawing the audience to her side and making them suffer with Aida. Of course, her actions are perfectly legitimate and it's frustrating every time to see her rebuffed. As an audience member, on the other hand, it's difficult to put ourselves in this situation. After all, for the most part, we have no idea what these struggles for survival in war feel like. Accordingly, it's not my place to judge the characters' behaviors, which don't seem particularly ethical to us. As much tension and back-and-forth tugging as this caused in me, unfortunately Duricic couldn't quite reach me emotionally. The nightmare she personally finds herself in with her family, and especially the mission to deliver bad news to the suffering survivors, can't be beat for incomprehension and emotional weight. However, I always felt as if the actress was always in a certain stage of empathy and self-pity that she couldn't get out of for the entire film. To me, there's a bit of a lack of breakthrough below that surface, where you could have bought into her suffering even more. Sure, she has scenes where she has outbursts and comes out of her equilibrium. However, these have been in short supply and once they are due, they are either too short or lack emotional impact for me.This is one of the few criticisms I can give the film. But even in this respect, it would not trigger enough emotions in me, it is successful in the end. Because I left the cinema with a heavy blow in the pit of my stomach and struggled for composure and words because of the, not really unpredictable, outcome. The subject matter sits too deep for that and leaves a layman, who was lucky enough not to have had to experience a war yet, shocked. Besides the fact how recently the event happened and the geographical proximity, I would have wished for some more impressions and information about Srebrenica. Thus, Quo Vadis, Aida? Is not really a war film, but rather a character study that creates an eerie and authentic atmosphere.",

July 1995: Aida works as a translator for the United Nations in the Bosnian city of Srebrenica. When the Serbian army comes to power, her family is one of the thousands of citizens who seek protection in the UN camp. Negotiations after negotiations, Aida translates critical information with fatal consequences. The war ends, the UN withdraws, so where do you go - quo vadis, Aida?Zbanic's depiction of Europe's latest war resembles a modern holocaust just too much. This is the uncomfortable truth, that only 25 years ago, thousands of hungry refugees were sitting in their own excrements begging the UN for shelter. However, the screen becomes hard to look away from as Zbanic's screenplay flips the United Nations the bird for their empty promise of bombing the Serbs if they attack.Nevertheless, the film finds love and hope in the title's question Quo Vadis, Aida? (Where are you going?) when Aida reveals, that she will return to school, which is where she is the happiest. Brief flashbacks of a dance night, the romance of a medical worker with a Bosnian civilian and the unexpected birth of a child keep the audience warm during the cold, monotonous nights at the UN shelter. It is courage, love and resilience that nourish Jasna Duricic performance of Aida to survive this war. Not knowing where you will be at the end of it, Quo Vadis, Aida? Is a slow ride into the abyss of Europe's past that's only for strong nerves.",

There is no heroes in this war.Like many war movies, the film makes the audience ask, what is the point of all this hatred and killing. Is it just because the synthetic idea of nationality? And how come UN was so helpless in preventing it? It is stomach-wrenching to see how after the war they continue to live together with the prior enemies, they may be your neighbors or colleagues.Sometimes it was hard to watch and at the end it made me angry.

Just doesn't do it. I guess it's hard to get passed the events portrayed and judge the movie for what it is: a poorly constructed story, with bad acting and poor direction. The title makes no sense in the context, other than attempting to appear smart. It fails.The story is unfocused, the characters are badly written and - I must sadly say - the protagonist failed to make me feel sympathy for her. And I must say this: if you are making a movie about a real massacre that happened less than 30 years ago in a country relatively close from mine and your main character doesn't make me feel for her, that's a failed story and portrayal in my book.",

Maybe this was a missed opportunity to create a better movie on the subject, especially from the artistic standpoint, but also to pack up the whole story to be more accurate and without going into exaggeration and politisation. All victims deserve to be heard in any case, especially since portraying of situation is should have been more accurate and fair to all stakeholders.",

For example, a teen girl is pulled away from her mother as they try to board a bus to leave Poticari - she wasn't pulled away just to go on another bus, if she ever made it to any bus at all. Some have complained that she didn't \"show\" enough of what happened. Visually, no she didn't and that's ok. The atrocities are implied and anyone that is interested in the gory details can just go to YouTube and Google Srebrenica Refugees. There are countless videos of the people as they arrive in Kladanj and Tuzla and you can hear their stories as they are interviewed. There are also plenty of Srebrenica survivor testimonies on YouTube, as well. Overall, great acting and a very good movie!",

I simply disagree with this approach, as personally, I am more interested in the actual historical events. So if you are too, then I surely don't recommend this movie for you to watch!3. Not sure of how historically accurate this movie is, but is nevertheless shallow at all aspects.

Throughout the 101 minutes, viewers are taken on a harrowing journey through crowded UN bases to wartorn towns and cities.\n\nBased on a true story, 'Quo Vadis, Aida?' follows Aida Selmanagi\u0107 (Jasna \u0110uri\u010di\u0107), a translator for the UN, from a small town known as Srebrenica. When the Serbian army takes over the town, her family is among the thousands of residents forced to leave their homes and seek shelter within the UN base where she works. Despite her family being in imminent danger, Aida must remain calm and collected while Bosnian General Ratko Mladi\u0107 (Boris Isakovi\u0107) engages in negotiations to maintain the civilians 'safety'. Will Aida be able to save her family while translating crucial information?\n\nJasna \u0110uri\u010di\u0107 gives a sensational performance in the leading role. Her portrayal of Aida is effortlessly fuelled by a mother's love for her family. Her need to protect her family oozes off the screen and only makes viewers sympathise even more with the character. The supporting cast also gives exceptional performances. Boris Isakovi\u0107 plays General Ratko with a perfect amount of arrogance, he portrays him as the monster he is without being too in your face. Izudin Bajrovi\u0107, Boris Ler and Dino Bajrovi\u0107 all provide performances that show just how daunting a situation they're in.\n\nDirector Jasmila \u017dbani\u0107 delivers such a devastating and brutal film to viewers, all the while keeping them interested and keeping the film moving. As well as directing, \u017dbani\u0107 also serves as producer and writer, providing the cast with a beautifully written script to work from. Christine A Maier's cinematography is utterly captivating, with imagery ranging from tight close-ups to wide shots framing swarms of helpless civilians, shocking viewers and giving them something to sympathise with that isn't Aida's struggle. Frequent handheld shots make viewers feel even more immersed in the gut-wrenching tragedy unfolding in front of them.\n\n'Quo Vadis, Aida?' does an excellent job of showing Aida's struggle as well as the wider problem, Aida's family isn't the only family displaced by the horrors of war. \u017dbani\u0107 also includes scenes that help viewers to realise just how many people had been affected by what was going on at the time. The numerous close-ups of character's faces throughout the film add yet another layer of emotion for viewers to sympathise with, and maybe even relate to. The film also does a great job following Aida's struggle as a mother to keep her family safe, begging on her knees and hiding them in machines in an effort to keep them near to her and away from whatever fate may lie ahead.\n\nThe film will appeal to many people as not only does it explore themes of family, but it also explores the idea of war. 'Quo Vadis, Aida?' isn't the first film made about the Srebrenica massacre, films like 'Srebrenica: A Cry from the Grave' and 'Circles' both follow the horrors that occurred during the Bosnian War, which only ended roughly 25 years ago. Overall, 'Quo Vadis, Aida?' is a harrowing tale that depicts the savagery of war and the desperation to keep your family safe.",

By a quirk of fate l was able to identify what was happening in my life at the time depicted in the film. I thought l was having a bad time. Man, oh man. A couple of other thoughts. It's impossible to watch this and not think about what is happening in Ukraine. And you cannot escape dark thoughts about Serbs, Russia's only European allies.

Machell, cine-vue.com\n\n\u2026 made even more urgent amidst the Russian war against Ukraine! The indifference masked as collaborative action is startling, and so weak. It continues to cost lives\n\nTo my mind, I've seen only one other wartime film as harrowing, stark and shocking as QVA, and that is Schindler's List. Of a different era, telling of a different genocide, it is as impactive, and sadly shows a number of similarities to WWII\n\nAn incredibly powerful and sombre movie, filled with emotional performances, and overseen by a masterful Director.

Set in 1995 Bosnia it's historical fiction with characters weaved in with the tragic and awful Srebrenica massacre. Central to the film is Aida, a teacher who has been co opted to be an interpreter for the UN. The film begins with Serbian forces laying siege to Srebrenica forcing the citizens to flee to the nearby UN base. Sadly the base can only take so many people with the rest stranded outside fearing for their lives. Aida's husband and two sons are among the stranded. All of this leads to a tense standoff between the UN and the Serbian forces led by General Mladic. This incredibly impressive film manages to weave together the strategies of war and diplomacy with the overwhelming human story of Aida's family and the besieged Bosnians. It's a tense ride as each second is filled with impending doom. Jasna Duricic is superb in the lead role, her character is filled with integrity, intelligence and bravery. This was an awful period in human history and this important film brings it lucidly to light.",

            "content": "This was the first film I'd visited the cinema to see on my own (the best and blissful way) in a very long time, and I'll make no bones about it, Quo Vadis Aida is quite possibly the best film I've seen so far this year. That's certainly not to say it's an easy watch, there are moments in the film where you can barely look at the screen, and much of that is down to the true story at the heart of the film. Set mainly over the course of a few days in 1995, Aida (a staggering performance by Jasna \u0110uri\u010di\u0107) is a translator for the UN in the small town of Srebrenica, in Bosnia. Despite promises from the UN to protect the town amidst an approaching Serbian army invasion, their assurances are backed up by a horrible no show as the invasion begins, and the town is forced to flee, a small percentage of them managing to take refuge in the UN camp on the edge of the town, until the camp closes its doors; restricting the remainder of the town to remain outside the camp's gates. This in itself is harrowing, but Aida has more problems than rushing about translating between the townspeople and UN soldiers; her husband and two boys are somewhere amongst the thousands of homeless Srebrenicans. She repeatedly tries to barter for their safety, and then as things take a nasty turn, their escape. We are left in no doubt of Aida's priority, it's a truly breathtaking portrayal by \u0110uri\u010di\u0107, the performance equally as powerful when she's not front and centre. What makes the film so disturbing is that through Aida, we appreciate and feel what all the families in Srebrenica were going through. The Serbian forces, led by the lunatic General Mladic, offer a way out for all the people after a hastily arranged negotiation between himself and three wildly unqualified Srebrenicans, including Aida's husband. The elation of the townspeople when it seems Mladic has offered a way out is palpable; it seems inevitable all won't go to plan for them. Quo Vaids Aida is beautifully shot, you feel like you're right there with the unfortunate habitants of Srebrenica, feeling the claustrophobia and stench of the camp. It's far from an easy watch, but it's a topic that really should be addressed more, especially to younger generations who seem to know less and less about the real world. The fact that this sort of thing (without trying to give too much away) goes on today and we know little about it, makes the film even more hard hitting, twenty six odd years on. The final quarter of the film is a masterpiece in emotional grief, acceptance, and an astonishing grit; the film is hard to pin down as a genre, and the final twenty minutes or so toughen an attempt to do so. I left the screening in tatters, returning to my car, only to switch on the radio and hear that the country was crying about a tweet that a teenager had written nine years ago, and as a result should apparently have his promising career stripped from him. After watching Quo Vadis Aida, and seeing what some of the real world has to deal with, this particular news left a disgusting taste.",

            "content": "The massacre of Srebrenica is unfortunately known to too few people - but above all, most people do not have on their radar how relatively recently this tragedy of July 11, 1995 occurred. In Quo Vadis, Aida? we follow Aida, a teacher working for the United Nations as a translator in a UN protection camp with a thousand citizens. Thanks to her work, Aida believes that she and her family are safe from the genocide taking place outside the camp. However, she gets to feel in a brutal way that a war knows no justice.\n\nThe plot always focuses on protagonist Aida (Jasna Duricic) and her iron will to bring her family to protection. Because no one is prioritized in such an exceptional situation, Aida often does not get what she wants. Yet she was hoping for exactly this consequence due to her special position as a translator. This results in some heated discussions and arguments with UN commanders and soldiers, who regularly refuse Aida's wishes. Duricic especially succeeds in this role in drawing the audience to her side and making them suffer with Aida. Of course, her actions are perfectly legitimate and it's frustrating every time to see her rebuffed. As an audience member, on the other hand, it's difficult to put ourselves in this situation. After all, for the most part, we have no idea what these struggles for survival in war feel like. Accordingly, it's not my place to judge the characters' behaviors, which don't seem particularly ethical to us. As much tension and back-and-forth tugging as this caused in me, unfortunately Duricic couldn't quite reach me emotionally. The nightmare she personally finds herself in with her family, and especially the mission to deliver bad news to the suffering survivors, can't be beat for incomprehension and emotional weight. However, I always felt as if the actress was always in a certain stage of empathy and self-pity that she couldn't get out of for the entire film. To me, there's a bit of a lack of breakthrough below that surface, where you could have bought into her suffering even more. Sure, she has scenes where she has outbursts and comes out of her equilibrium. However, these have been in short supply and once they are due, they are either too short or lack emotional impact for me.\n\nThis is one of the few criticisms I can give the film. But even in this respect, it would not trigger enough emotions in me, it is successful in the end. Because I left the cinema with a heavy blow in the pit of my stomach and struggled for composure and words because of the, not really unpredictable, outcome. The subject matter sits too deep for that and leaves a layman, who was lucky enough not to have had to experience a war yet, shocked. Besides the fact how recently the event happened and the geographical proximity, I would have wished for some more impressions and information about Srebrenica. Thus, Quo Vadis, Aida? is not really a war film, but rather a character study that creates an eerie and authentic atmosphere.",

However, after watching about 10 to 15 minutes, it was abundantly clear what was going to happen. For the rest of the movie, it became a desperate, maddening, and heartbreaking descend into the inevitable. This was shown through the lens of our main character, and her desperation was relatable, like if you were in her shoes you would do everything she did. \n\nThe color and cinematography also heightened the desperation. The movie looked monotonous. The overwhelming color of the ground during the day felt hot, dry, and reflected the dire situation the civilians were in. Even more, the movie felt so raw, making me feel like I'm actually there with the people. \n\nAnd then the ending hit. I knew it was coming, but still I was in silence as the camera slowly moved away. There's no need for showing actual violence. Just the sound was enough to convey the horror. The last scene was a strong testament of the director about the unjust event.\n\nOverall, a devastating movie that i would not want to see again. 9/10",

Even knowing the outcome, the film pulsed with energy and dread as Aida frantically tries to figure out the right path forward. I loved the film.

Told from the perspective of a UN interpreter who struggles to find safety for her family during the crisis, the film follows the ordeals of Muslim refugees fleeing the onslaught of merciless Serb militants and the United Nations' inability and ineptitude in providing the protection promised them. Director Jasmila Zbanic's latest puts viewers in the middle of the unfolding genocide, re-creating the horror and anguish experienced by those caught up in it without ever becoming graphic or gratuitous but nevertheless palpably unnerving. The excellent ensemble cast, led by the award-worthy performance of Jasna Djuricic as the desperate protagonist, sell this story so effectively that one can't help but feel what they and their peers are going through. \"Quo Vadis, Aida?\" will undoubtedly leave audiences uncomfortable and heartbroken, but it brings to light the unspeakable atrocities that occurred during this conflict in hopes that we never experience it again.",
