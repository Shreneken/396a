Heartbroken she gets her own back at him with help from her friend Aiden(Madison Pettis) by making a bet that she can transform any nerdy guy into a prom king. She decides to place her bet on an antisocial photographer named Cameron Kweller(Tanner Buchanan) who isn't all that popular. At first she is enjoying her little bet,but she later finds herself falling for Cameron (after he got a makeover).Will Cameron and Padgett end up being together in the end?. Well you betcha they do.Overall I thought it was OK. The original one was way better in my opinion as this seems like a product placement for Tik Tok.Also stars 2 of the original She's All That actors as different characters Rachel Leigh Cook as Addison's mom(she was the nerdy girl in the original one) and Matthew Lillard as Principal Bosch(who played the douchbag Freddie Prinze Jr's ex girlfriend dated). And a surprise cameo by Kourntey Kardashian as Jessica.Shame Freddie Prinze Jr didn't make a cameo.",

This movie had all the aspects of an unrealistic, poorly written, amateurish, predictable, high budget but with untalented casting staff movie.

Literally the lead \"actress\"/not an actress must of read the script's notes: \"Cameron enters room and his handsome face takes Padge's breath away.\" In that scene she is literally panting when she see Cameron's newfound hotness.

I thought maybe I missed a scene where she was doing aerobics for a bit before he came out of the bathroom but no, that's just how she played it..

            "content": "Everything for the eyes of a pretty rich girl. This is pretty much what I think when I saw this movie. There is so many talented artists out there, but for the remake of She's All That, executives has chosen privilege over artistic awareness. And by casting Ms. Addison Rae as their lead, they have sent a message: \"If you a rich and pretty, you will be given priority over other poorer artists.\" This isn't new but this is also very sad. And that kind of choices have consequences.Here, we are talking about a dull remake with very questionable acting skills from the main actress. The thing with bad acting is this. Watching an actor embracing a character should give to the viewers an immersive experience: We forget that we are watching a character and we start to believe that we are watching real life people being filmed. When a bad actor tries himself in the production a movie, that immersive experience is ruined and instead, we realize that we are watching an actor painfully reading his/her lines. And this is exactly what one will experience by watching Ms. Rae on He's All That. You are not watching a character, you are watching someone 'trying' to be an actor in an average budget movie. And I hate to say that about a (wannabe/would be)actress, but the all thing smell 'fraud'.The silver lining is that the other professional actors did very well (and the difference is noticeable in every scenes) except from a cameo from a famous reality show contestant, that I won't spoil for you here if you are still interested in watching the movie. And it's always a pleasure to see Rachael Leigh Cook on screen, even though she looks way to young to be playing this lady's mother.The story is very typical and you couldn't do more clich\u00e9. But usually, with that type of predictable movie, there is always an element of charm to them. You know how it will end, but you appreciate the ride. We sadly do not get that here, apart from a few moments with Tanner Buchanan and especially Isabella Crovetti (the best actor here). The all thing seems a bit un-naturally manufactured, as if an AI had generated a movie by mixing and using all the elements that have been done in every teen rom-coms before it. The movie is also too fancy and clean whereas the original was a bit gritty in a few aspects. The humor also fall flat.I would have loved a good gender swap remake of She's All That as the concept wasn't a bad idea in itself. But I just wish Hollywood would drop the habit of privileging non-talented people to please the rich and beautiful who suddenly feel like they are actors, because they have money in their bank accounts (and because they said so), instead of choosing quality and talent. How many times have we seen privileged people steal the place of poorer better talents? A habit that I wish we would leave behind in 2021. I don't know much about her talents as a dancer though, and maybe she's very good at that, but Addison Rae simply isn't an actress.I am putting a 2/10 for Isabella Crovetti, but there is not much else here.",

This is not awards season fodder. This is also not meant to excite any acting or story driven fans. I would expect that people who are looking forward to see this, would be aware of this. If you weren't I hope you are now.Does this have flaws and does the ugly duckling story have issues all over the place? Yes but the charisma of the actors involved may make that obsolete.

This is not one of them.The Bad: This may legitimately be a list of every aspect of film and filmmaking. I'm not joking. This movie is competently made; it's a movie with a plot that goes from A to B, it conveys information adequately and it looks (kinda) like a movie. Aside from that baseline, pretty much everything - the acting, writing, editing, cinematography, costumes, set design, dialog - is absolutely awful. I'll mention two things: Addison Rae is REALLY trying here, but for most of the movie she sounds like she's pitching an ad, not speaking to actual people. To be fair, most of the actors here are REALLY, REALLY bad. The other thing I'll note is how poorly the writers understand youth, and particularly,\ninternet, culture. Why would you even make this movie, if not to take the original story, but modify it for a new audience? They think they're doing it, but there's no explanation or representation for how this generation is different from the kids of the original. To me, that's such a missed opportunity.The Ugly: This movie is so insanely stuffed with brands, I almost couldn't believe it. Then I realized that maybe, just maybe, it was an inadvertent reflection of how seemingly half of all kids nowadays are intent in building a future via sponsorship by large corporations.

I went into this saying I'd give her a chance, just to see how she did (even though acting isn't just something people can do, let alone do well, without experience, training, and talent).But it is honestly a shame they cast her. She is purely presentational, trying to \"act\", but it's surface and superficial, what a person with no experience believes acting to be.Because of this, and her being the lead, she basically brings down the entire film, and it makes it very difficult to enjoy, despite the rest of the film having all the other elements to be a guilty-pleasure.",

The lead actress was basically reading from a script. The pacing was too rushed, the dialogue was awful (even some of the re-used lines from the original fell flat). 0 chemistry between the two.

            "review_title": "A soulless cringe-fest created for rich white influencers",
            "content": "Auditions exist for a reason. We all know of them -- they're the process where the creators of a movie check to see if an actor actually has talent before casting them in a role. This is exactly what the creators of HE'S ALL THAT, a new Netflix high school rom-com, should have done before casting TikTok influencer Addison Rae in the lead role of their film. To be fair, Rae's casting in this film is the least of its problems, but it is still confounding that such a popular movie has such an uncharismatic and bland lead performance anchoring the story. With that being said, HE'S ALL THAT is a failure in almost every possible way. If a person above the age of 50 viewed this movie without any context, they would want to purge the entirety of Gen Z from the Earth after viewing. Not only is it awkward, cringe-worthy and painfully predictable, but it promotes a privileged, rich and LA-centric version of life that I wish would only be documented in a negative connotation.The film is a remake of the 1999 rom-com She's All That, except this film is gender-swapped and centers around a social-media influencer. Essentially, Padgett Sawyer (Addison Rae playing herself) must regain her social media fame when an embarrassing incident causes her to lose followers. In order to do this, she places a bet with her friend that she can make the biggest loser in the school to win prom king with her. After she chooses Cameron Kweller (Tanner Buchanan), an old-fashioned guy with no social media presence who likes Bad Religion and Kubrick, thus begins a romance that everyone has seen a million times before except far better. I understand that rom-coms like this aren't supposed to be judged based on their predictability, but when during any point in the movie I found myself being able to predict beat-for-beat how the next few scenes would play out, I'd say there's a problem.The only things that weren't contributing to the mediocrity in this movie are Tanner Buchanan, Rachael Leigh Cook and Matthew Lillard. The latter two are only present because they were in the original 1999 film, so it's only natural they're far better than the rest of the cast. Tanner Buchanan attempts to pull his own weight here (he was very good in Cobra Kai, the Karate Kid sequel show), but neither him nor anyone else can really do anything with the atrocious material they are given to work with. The dialogue here sounds like the wealthy L. A. screenwriter wrote it half asleep without knowing anything about public schooling and sent it to production without proofreading it. On top of that, the acting, for the most part, seems like a middle school play where the students are reading their lines straight from a piece of paper. The scenes near the end where characters have to get emotional are so badly acted that I laughed about ten times more than when the movie was actually trying to make me laugh.What bothers me about many high school movies that get greenlit recently is the focus on rich, white and affluent neighborhoods and an ignorance of the high school stories that are actually interesting. HE'S ALL THAT is that trend on steroids, to the point where the message of the movie involving influencers on social media is only relatable to those who have the time and money to indulge in this culture. The film seems like it was made for and by rich white people in Los Angeles, and seems to be a symptom of people like Addison Rae being able to do literally whatever they want with no consequences. The ultimate irony of HE'S ALL THAT is the fact that the message involves how influencers are more interesting and personable than the fake pictures they post online, yet this film is the most soulless and fake product from Netflix all year. Way to prove the haters right.HE'S ALL THAT is worth watching if you and friends want something to ruthlessly roast while eating snacks or doing something else that will require more of your attention. Other than that, I'd say this film is one to avoid unless you enjoy cringing for an hour and thirty minutes straight. Supposedly Addison Rae has a deal with Netflix to executive produce and star in at least three more projects, which sounds like the worst idea since producing a live-action version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats. Giving this movie money by watching it is the cinematic equivalent of driving an SUV and contributing to the destruction of the environment. For the love of God, buy an electric car instead.D-",

We really have a very shallow character that actually works hard to try and make her likable.. Or a real relatable person and succeeds at neither.I actually watched it for Tanner Buchanan who I really liked on \"Cobra Kai\". He's not a great actor either. But definitely better than this.I am not even a huge fan of the original. But the plot worried at least even though I still find the slam poetry scene cringy as hell. Unfortunately this film basically starts with that and never isn't cringy. Packed full of advertisments for everything under the sun.It's not even a bad idea over all.. but the other characters are just so dumb and even the progression is awful. It just stickers around. The main character should be shallow and even a bit unlikable but the film goes to lengths to make her like super awesome. Which is wrong and she can't pull it off anyway. They should have made her warm up and it never works.The one bright spot for me was the original cast members. It's just a brief appearance but still more acting than anyone else in this \"production\" put in.A real shame because the original wasn't spectacularly original but had such sweet and even genuine performances from actors who seemed like real people. Unfortunately none of the teen cast in this can make that claim.",

Only thing good was Matthew Lillard and he barely had any scenes. But hey claps to Addison for trying. I feel like remakes of original movies always turn out badly but this one was just on a whole other level. The 1999 version is wayy better so I encourage people to watch that one instead.",

Sure, it's predictable and silly but at the heart of it is a good message and it's very sweet and funny.He's all that just feels like a cynical cash-in of the original. The plot is pretty much exactly the same, except of course being 2021 it features social media and people on their phones all the time.It isn't to say the film is totally without merit. The ending, though totally predictable, is kind of sweet, with a good message, but the whole film just feels so unnecessary. We all know Hollywood exists these days for sequels, remakes and reboots!Rachel Leigh Cook and Matthew Lillard from the original She's All That do appear in this movie and their roles are kind of fun and take a little look back at the original. Rachel Leigh Cook could almost be playing a 40 something Laney Boggs in this!I don't know, maybe it's age and rose tinted glasses, but He's All That just doesn't have the feel good factor of She's All That. I know, I know, I'm 43 now so the film isn't really aimed at my age group, but as I loved the original so much I had to see this Netflix effort. I think had I not known the original this movie would have seemed like an OK typical high school movie about popularity and the boy getting the girl etc.It's alright. But to be honest if you want to watch a \"makeover movie\" watch the 1999 original. Yes it's old and dated now, but it's far superior and sweeter.",

Well, Addison as your lead role was already a complete failure of a movie even though she wasn't the worst thing of this movie, although that would be just about everything in it. I really thought Alden was gonna be a nice friend but they instead made her the bad guy which was horrifying and kind of poetic in the worst way possible . Don't even get me started on the terrible pacing and dialogue of this movie. Right after something happened it jumped right into another scene. People were talking 24/7, and I get its a movie, but the amount of dialogue is ridiculous. If your going to include tons of talking at least make it good writing and interactions. The acting was subpar at best and the plot of a girl betting on a guy to \"transform him\" feels like it's been reused so many times it's tiring. Matthew Lillard was easily the best part of this movie and he only had like 15 minutes of screen time. Quinn and Padgett's mom were the only other somewhat tolerable character's in this movie. Don't even get me started in that horrific what, 2 minute dance-off between the \"bad\" and \"good\" guys. There's also no one in their right mind who would forgive someone who only had romantic interest in them because of a bet in less than a day and act like nothing ever happened. Also riding in on a horse on school grounds doesn't seem like something that could happen . . . Ever. Not even in a damn movie if you want said movie to be good and not be considered a joke. Even the great Tanner Buchanan from Cobra Kai couldn't elevate this movie in any way, shape or form. The writing was just too awful and unbearable to work from the get go. This movie is so bad that it's funny, and that's the only reason I gave it 2 instead of 1/10 stars. Oh, and Addison, please just stick to your TikTok dances, it's whats in your best interests.",

Yes, the guy was already hot before it, but so was Laney in the original movie, let's not forget about that. The real problem was how terrible the script was : the pacing was terrible, the situations were cringe, the product placements were so obvious, the movie could have just broke into an advertisment, it wouldn't have changed anything and the dance battle was just... diabolical,100% of pure cringe juice. The guy playing the popstar was just....... No ? Tanner Buchanana has no acting range and was monotone and emotionless the whole time. Madison Pettis.... what was she doing here ? She needs to get booked for real movies ASAP. Isabella Cramp was probably the best actress (and a great one) in that movie. She's only 16 but I think she can go far into acting. Addison wasn't so bad but... Maybe she should take acting lessons ? To go from average, to good ? At least she did better than the D*melio sisters.In conclusion, to my very very long review : Don't watch that movie. It's a waste of time. Isabella Cramp could have saved it if she had more screentime than Tanner Budapest. The scriptwriter needs to go to their room and think about what they've done. Netflix ? You need help.",

Or they just gave him cruddy directions and poor script notes. Either way, he never even looked like ugly duckling boy, instead they made him a little dirty but that's it. He mostly just had that deer in headlights expression when standing there. And I'm ashamed of Cook & Lillard who are legitimately good actors. What motivated them? Promises of gold and rubies??

She acted like a typical influencer, all giddy. I appreciate the dance routine thrown in the movie. Adding a Kardashian in the movie is fitted as the main character is an influencer. It could have done with at least a couple known actors to help the movie. I agree with the others that Rachel should have played herself to associate that in the story, same goes for Matthew Lillard. They just wasted the potential of linking this to the original as a sequel instead of a remake. It might have made a better story. It is an average movie, one time watch only if you have nothing else to see.",

            "content": "2021\n12A\ndirector: Mark Waters\nstarring: Addison Rae, Tanner Buchanan, Madison Pettis, Rachel Leigh Cook, Mathew Lillard, Peyton Meyer, Isabella Crovetti, Annie Jacob, Myra Molloy etcA teenage girl sets out to give a nebbish classmate the ultimate high school makeover. An updated remake of the 1999 film, She's All That. This film really wasn't that bad at all, people are being way too harsh. I think certain people who review it need to realise the target audience for the film.My first few positives would be the performances, likeable characters, and humour. As well as the chemistry between the cast and the fun cameo. The performances in this film were pretty good. Tanner Buchanan did a great job here, his performance was charming and the character he portrayed was relatable and funny and he stole the show. And I have to say Addison Rae did a good job here. She has got unnecessary hate. For her first big acting role she showed a lot of charm and promise, there are obviously a few things to work on, but respect to her for doing a solid job. The film was also funny, at least in my case it was occasionally for the wrong reasons. But the film was funny due to its extreme self-awareness, and the chemistry between the cast members. There were also some pretty funny lines from Tanner's character. The cast also had fantastic chemistry here. Addison and Tanner had great chemistry with each other. They worked together well, and their romance was sweet and charming as they grew as characters. I also liked the chemistry between Addison and Rachel Cook, their mother and daughter relationship was sweet. The cameo from Kourtney Kardashian was also funny as well, it was very cringy, but I found it entertaining that she used a different name for the film.My first few negatives would be the script and dialogue. As well as how generic and predictable the film is. Also, the odd main concept. The script was extremely poorly written, adding absolutely nothing new to genre and following every genre trope you can think of it was very generic, formulaic, and safe which is fine as long as you know what to expect. The film was also painfully predictable. You could tell how the film was going to play out and predict the different plot points before they even happened, it's a shame as they could have tried something a little out of the box. But once again this was expected, but it was still poorly handled. The Dialogue was also extremely corny and eye rolling. There were certain lines that have been used in countless other teen rom coms and it made me want to vomit slightly in parts. I also found the main concept strange. Tanner was already attractive before he had his makeover for the film, all they did was cut his hair and make him dress smarter. However, the bare minimum was done in the original film as well.My next few positives would be the decent set up for the main plot point, as well as the great set locations and character development. As well as the charming tone and fun scenes. I thought the set up for Padgett and Cameron meeting was a decent way to set up the main plot point of the bet for prom king and to have Padgett develop as a character. I thought the film had great set locations. The films sets were beautiful and set the mood for some fun scenes with the different events and parties and it helped with the films visual appeal. The film had decent character development. Padgett really grew as a character as her relationship with Cameron grew. She became a lot less self-obsessed and a lot more thoughtful and started living her life as herself instead of a fake personality for social media. And Cameron really grew and came out of his shell, Padgett made him be himself more. And the development about his family and his mum was sweet and gave him some decent character depth. I also thought the film had a harmless and fun charming tone, it didn't take itself too seriously, it knew what kind of movie it was, and the cast had good chemistry, so I found it very charming a lot of the time. There were some fun and entertaining scenes with the different parties that despite being very cheesy were sweet and fun to watch.My final few negatives would be the corny set up, lack of character background and unlikeable character decisions. The whole set up with Padgett losing her followers and popularity was extremely corny and just lazily set up. The set up for her redemption was good enough but this was poor. I also thought there was a lack of character depth and background to most of the characters. The supporting cast was likeable, but they were all very one dimensional and didn't deliver too much to the story. I also thought there was some unlikeable character decisions. It just felt a bit strange that Padgett was still going with the bet with Cameron for so long even when she grew feelings for him. I get the needed conflict, but it was oddly structured for me, and it made her character unlikeable for parts of the film.My final few positives would be the villains, good LGBT representation. As well as the fun final act, good themes, and uplifting ending. I thought the film did a good job with its villains. Both villains were very unlikeable and did their roles well. And when they eventually got what they deserved it was satisfying. I also liked the good LGBT representation. The film didn't shy away from having LGBT supporting characters which is great to see, Annie Jacob and Myra Molloy actually got their own storyline in the film, and it was a nice little bit of representation. The final act was also fun. It was entertaining and completely harmless. I was smiling so it did its job at having solid character arcs and good themes on accepting yourself, and not being fake on social media. The ending was also uplifting, due to being party invested in the main characters relationship them getting together was satisfying and very corny but it was a good cheesy ending.Overall, He's all that is far from a masterpiece. But nowhere near as bad as what people are saying. Despite being painfully predictable and generic, and adding nothing new to the genre. It is surprisingly watchable. Due to the films charm, chemistry between the leads and its self-awareness. I watched the film knowing exactly what it was going to be and who its target audience was, so I enjoyed it a lot more.Overall score 58/100.",

But can't help that the movie is cringe... so many unsettling rather stupid scenes, like, the fight between Cameroon and Jordan, and he was put his precious camera next to the pool when he can hand it to his sister and/or best friend. No body as dumb as that....\nAnd The prom? Dance competition? Damn cringe - also the themed is under the ocean, and The main character is the ONLY GIRL use RED? Kinda forceful.The fact that he come with horse at the end is so predictable. But then the sister come with car?So... you ride horse for what? CRINGE MOMENT.

This is the writing I wanted for the first one! It was sweet and witty and funny and clever and smart and brilliant and thoughtful and sincere and above all honest and it made for a fun barn burner! I really do feel this way! I loved it! And I think everyone did a great job , who knows perhaps this handsome lead might be the next Batman or something, lots of great up and coming talent but for me, the writing on this one was superlative, not a single complaint something didn't flow right or something terrible jarring and disgusting (meaning something that tramps all over the incipient stages of it's own writing) there was none of that, it built on itself , it worked through the characters, it handled the whole modern content very well which is not easy owing to all of the extra intel flying all around , it seems like the world is hauling major ass sitting on top of a major wave dashing against all sorts of different ways of distracting ourselves , and this captured this zeitgeist and ran with and made something I believe to be truly special!

It was another romcom with its cheesy / \"been there done that\" moments like most Netflix's shows. Addisons acting was not at all bad . It wasn't Oscar worthy , but I didn't cringe , yeah she needs vast improvement if she's gonna follow a career in acting (which I presume she won't) but it's not like I wish it had been anyone else but her, in her place . Lastly , i feel like the hatred is mainly directed and coming from Addison being in it. Say what you want to say about other worthy actors who don't make it far in the industry, despite having talent, cause people like Addison who don't deserve it , take roles just cause of their following and name (and ure valid) , but the girl is succeeding , she's just branching out and making money.

I picture my 14 year old actual teen in there trying to explain the audience to a bunch of old guys clapping themselves on the back and howling as they come up with such clever ideas as the bf turned ex getting caught in the act. NOBODY WILL SEE THAT COMING.However, seeing the turning of the tables of the beyond stale makeover trope had the potential to be refreshing. Lead guy being actually good at things rather than a \"loser\" was a good play. Him being pretty confident but uninterested in the superficial school atmosphere was less cringe than other standard plots.The idea that it was actually her that needed the makeover was well done. Just SUPERBLY POORLY EXECUTED. Figure out who that one writer was and keep them on. Fire everyone else. Stat.",

But this is a rom-com, a cheesy, over the top, rom-com.It's a fun watch after a long day, nothing too serious, and has some light-hearted laughs. People are wayyy too hard on TikTokers than they need to be.",

It was like they were unafraid to feel how they really felt.I will say this, I hate the Kardashians and when I saw Kim I rolled my eyes but in this movie she was exactly who I expected her to be so it all worked out. I miss these kind of feel good movies. This would be more for teenagers then grown adults so that is why so much hate. This is a clue, if you read the story of the movie and it ain't you cup of tea, then MOVE ON! For me it was like mean girls, she's all that and a few other high school drama movies all in one.The leads were beautiful to watch the whole time and the drama kept me in my seat. Never a dull moment, and could they dance! I would not say this was a rom-com it was more like a rom-dram! Lol And for me I loved it. Imagine that, an adult enjoyed this movie.

Not by a long shot (people giving these low reviews have obviously never seen Lifetime movies or low budget horror films-now THOSE are truly bad) it was more that it was disappointing. They had a chance with this one but they botched it.I think it's safe to say that this is a product of the generation coming up now and the times. People don't have attention spans anymore due to social media. It's all been boiled down to seconds long clips and emojis. I haven't been able to find a truly decent movie in awhile now because audiences only seem to want to watch Marvel movies. If someone takes a risk and makes an intelligent movie - it doesn't do well because people can't get into anything unless it's non-stop in your face action. As a result we have one dumbed down movie after another and people wonder why. That is why this film didn't surprise me. I knew it wasn't gonna be great and I knew it'd be dumbed down because an Instagram star is the lead. Although honestly I didn't think AR did that bad of a job. She's not Kate Winslet but this wasn't what they were looking for.I'm usually a very harsh critic but as far as teen movies go you could do a lot worse. If you are comparing it to She's All That well then yes this is terrible. That's a classic and frankly you can't have lightening in a bottle a second time. There's only one Freddie Prinze Jr.I didn't think this was that bad. The lead guy and the lesbian Asian friend were standouts to me. Rachel Leigh Cook is usually great but she wasn't given much to work with and so she was basically phoning it in. Matthew Lillard was in this for a cup of coffee and he has gotten old which threw me for a loop. Also the thing that made me roll my eyes is - the lead is NEVER shown working out. He doesn't play sports nor do they show any weights in his house and yet...when the obligatory makeover scene happens he takes off his shirt and he's movie star ripped! I'm not talking a little bit of definition...I'm talking he looks like he did a 10 month strict regimen of eating and working out like it's his job ripped and that's just soooo unrealistic. My son worked out and followed a strict eating regimen from the time he was 15 until now (he's 24)...I'm talking working out EVERY DAY on a specialized program with NO steroids and he doesn't even have a stomach like that kid. You only get that way from working out all day and only eating chicken and fish every couple of hours. It's a full-time job. It's ridiculous when they show stuff like that like \"He's just a normal HS kid and just naturally built like that.\" So unrealistic.This was very cutesy and generic and cliche which is what I had a problem with. Also I thought we were moving away from all white movies but nope here it is 2021 and we are still putting out movies with all the leads being white. They had different races represented but they were only tertiary characters. I thought the industry was trying to do better with that but you'd never know it by this film.I swear if aliens came down and watched these teen films they would think all the high schools on earth are the same but honestly where does this kind of H. S. exist? Yes kids are cruel and bullies etc...but the way things are portrayed in movies you'd think things were like this everywhere and really it's just not that way.This movie is a representation of everything that is wrong with the world. Our society has turned into something that quite frankly can't sustain itself for very long. We are churning out a bunch of mindless individuals who don't know what it means to make a commitment to anything (quit at the slightest bit of pushback), care about holding down a job, learning proper grammar or holding up anything more than good looks or likes on social media as the measure of success. Many people today are shallow, uncaring and unfeeling and that will come back to bite us at some point. Watching this just made me frustrated more than anything.If you want to watch a good movie go back and watch She's All That.",

It should not have been a copy of the original twisted into this generation. We really didn't need a hot duckling being remade into a slightly more hot duckling just for social media presence. I feel like the main girl didn't really learn her lesson as things sort of fell in place for her.

            "content": "The film is bad in so many different ways, number one acting is awful on the behalf of Addison Rae, it was so bad to point I was cringing the hole time. There were certain moments where the acting and the editing combined was a complete mess for example, there was a scene where Addison Rae was talking to her friends and she hasn't even moved her mouth but she still spoke. In addition the scene where Addison was handing out leaflets she put her arm in to pick up the leaflets but never actually picked one up and just moved her arm out in motion of handing a leaflet out when she didn't even pick one up and that happened 3 or 4 times within the space of a minute. The second reason this film is awful was because of the editing / camera work, the camera work and editing was unimaginative and simple boring to the point where it kept cutting from person to person in conversation making it very boring and not visually eye appealing and if I'm being honest it looked plain lazy! The third thing was the plot , the plot to the story was so bad and cringy and that's all that need so be said about the plot. So overall I gave this a 2 because although it's awful and I don't like it it isn't fair to give a 0 out of 10 or 1 out of 10. The last thing that needs to be said it that people only watched this either because they knew it was gonna be bad or to watch Addison Rae which in my opinion was the worst part of the film.",

Then all they did was reveal that Laney had huge boobs in the first film and Cameron had a six pack in this one and the other lead characters started drooling over them. It's pointless. What's the moral? \"If you're hot, go ahead and show it and you'll find love. But if you're not, you're just out of luck\"?

(Who didn't love FPJ in the 90's?) Therefore, when I stumbled upon this movie on Netflix, I had to check it out. I must admit, though, that I was left wanting.The story was similar to the predecessor, \"She's All That\" so I knew the protagonist would find a nerdy to makeover and bring to prom. He'd become \"hot\", and they'd fall in love at the end.I didn't appreciate the acting. The characters didn't seem real enough. Tanner Buchanan who gave a brilliant performance in Cobra Kai, was not up to the mark in this one. The Addison Rae's character- a social media addict who only seems to care about her social hierarchy- lacked depth. I didn't connect with either of them. In short, the story was tired with nothing to look forward to, and the lackluster performances didn't help much either.I wish I could find something that I enjoyed about the movie but there is nothing notable.

A concept story about an instagram influencer Padgett (Addison Rae) who is popular and obsessed with having many followers. When she catches her boyfriend cheating on her. And her reputation is ruined. She makes a bet that she can turn an unpopular guy to a popular guy. She finds Cameron (Tanner Buchanan) who is unpopular and does not care about followers or what people think of him. She does a make over on him and falls for him.Plot is similar with a gender twist. The film is a lot of fun with humor and heart. The films direction being modern with tiktok or media influencers on popularity was a fun addition. Seeing teens being obsessed with media. Cast is great. The film does have some entertaining and fun moments.",

            "content": "THE PITT NEWS\n\"He's All That\" Review: Addison Rae should stick to dancing, not actingNetflix's new rom-com \"He's All That\" is the gender-bent remake of the classic 1999 hit \"She's All That,\" starring TikTok influencer Addison Rae.Katy Perry karaoke pool parties and \"Drop it like F. Scott\" Great Gatsby birthdays are just the start of the over-the-top elements incorporated in Netflix's new original movie, \"He's All That.\"\"He's All That\" is the gender-bent remake of the classic 1999 hit \"She's All That,\" and just another example of a clich\u00e9 teenage rom-com revival that didn't need to be made in the first place.The story follows Padgett Sawyer (Addison Rae), a social media influencer from California, on a mission to regain her followers and sponsorship money after an embarrassing video goes viral of her walking in on her cheating boyfriend. She makes a bet that she can win back her reputation by building a new prom king \"it\" boy, in loner Cameron Kweller (Tanner Buchanan).Essentially, the plot follows the same basic story line of every coming-of-age movie - a popular conceited high school student resolves a problem by giving a makeover to an outcast and uses them for their own personal gain.The two leads fall in love, bonding over the loss of Cameron's mother and his love for photography. Once again, we have another teen movie involving a tragic backstory death of a parent. To no one's surprise they fall in love, but their bliss is derailed when Cameron finds out about the bet. They fight and then inevitably make up once Padgett apologizes with a long speech about her insecurities.The only true difference in this film compared to other rom-coms is that instead of using real actors, TikTok star Addison Rae plays the protagonist. Her performance should be off the charts considering she basically plays her real-life self, however, that isn't the case. In truth, by casting Rae, Netflix has made it clear that anyone with money can be on TV and has taken roles from countless talented actors.Tanner Buchanan's performance is better in his role as the mysterious loner transformed by Rae into a gorgeous pretty boy. However, the \"makeover\" really only consisted of a haircut, which in my opinion didn't need changing in the first place.The magical makeover is a far too common trope for movies and TV shows. While it may be entertaining to watch the characters get spruced up, it reinforces the idea that acceptance from others solely comes from looks.In other un-shocking news, \"He's All That\" incorporates way too many current references, with conversation overloaded with talk of social media followers, duck faces, livestreaming and internet memes. This obliterates the element of a timeless movie feel and can only be enjoyable to a 14-year-old Gen-Zer.This movie chooses to promote spoiled teenage rich kids who live in fancy mansions and wear expensive and frankly unattractive clothing. Even the food consumed is extravagant, from red cherry pop rock mocktails to almond flour croquembouches.On a more positive note, besides Rae, the acting isn't terrible. There are actually a few stars that make an appearance and a few newcomers who had a solid performance. Rachael Leigh Cook from the original film plays Padgett's mother. Matthew Lillard plays the school principal and, with his 10 minutes of screen time, has better acting skills than Rae during the entire movie.Of course, no Netflix film is complete without a guest appearance by a random unneeded celebrity. In this case, Kourtney Kardashian plays Rae's wealthy sponsor.There is also a pretty diverse soundtrack with the songs \"For A Minute\" by WizTheMC and \"Kiss Me\" by Sixpence None the Richer. This song parallels the original \"She's All That,\" as it was used in both ending scenes.I was excited to see some former Disney actress familiar faces, such as Madison Pettis from \"The Game Plan\" and \"Cory In The House\" and Peyton Meyer from \"Girl Meets World\".My expectations for \"He's All That\" were extremely low, and they weren't exceeded. I did, however, find myself laughing out loud at some cringey scenes and enjoyed a few heartfelt moments from the side characters.Hiring Rae inevitably forces viewers to focus solely on her indecent acting, and turns the movie into a joke. The only thing worse than unprofessional acting is an unnecessary and random dance off - even if Rae and Pettis' dance off was pretty solid choreography wise.If you're looking for a movie to watch, I would recommend this film but for all the wrong reasons. The plot is more comical than the actual jokes. Instead of being let down by another failed movie remake, stick to watching the original \"She's All That,\" and enjoy a '90s throwback filled with nostalgia.",

This film is awful in all aspects, from the casting to the plot, to the dialogue to the general characterisation. This is an hour and a half of second-hand cringe, and I question why people like Matthew Lillard and Rachael Leigh Cook wanted to be involved. That said, Matthew Lillard was the only redeeming part of this mess and he gave an excellent performance as expected.It is badly constructed with generally questionable shots and editing that is more reminiscent of a GCSE student film than it is a professional production company, and considering Netflix have put out some real winners prior to this, I am amazed that this went into post-production and no one said a thing about the quality of the work in front of them.As many reviewers have already pointed out, Addison Rae cannot act. She's a mediocre dancer and I'm sure that with her following on TikTok she must have some redeeming and entertaining qualities, but she is painful to watch and I do not understand the thought that went into casting her in a lead role beyond Netflix's desire to cash in on the currently popular clock app. None of the lead cast are particularly good, but she stands out among the worst.Overall a hot mess. 1/10.",

That being said, setting aside the god awful on trend writing, the acting wasn't awful. However, Addison is very clearly not an actress and I think that was more than prevalent in her performance.

Actually, I dont really understand why most of this cast was casted. Most of these characters were not charming, or charasmatic, or had any sort of personaility that would make me want to keep watching this movie.I found the acting from most of the cast to be incredibly flat and subpar. I understand this is Addisons first role, but nothing about her performance in this movie made up for the fact that she came from a platform like Tik Tok. It doesn't even seem like she even wants to act. I am all for creators from platforms such as Tik Tok, YouTube, etc.. breaking into the entertainment industry. But that usually is because that is something that they have been wanting to do. Addison's performance does not lead me to believe this was actually something she wanted to do, and that she would improve upon.Finally, I just really wish that this movie did not exist. Where was the demand for a reboot of this movie??? This movie added absolutely NOTHING to the first one. I understand that this is not a sequel, but at least add something to the story. It's such a well known movie, so if you don't add anything of substance, how is anyone going to want to watch this?

There were awesome cameos (RLC and Matthew Lillard), cute homages to the original (the jerk best friend, the spunky little sister, the dance off, the \"why do I know this song?\", etc.), and typical Gen Z social media material.I really DO NOT understand why everyone is hating on this so bad. Addison Rae was endearing and adorable, Tanner Buchanan was an awesome lead, and all the rest of the characters were believable.In my opinion, if you're a true She's All That fan, you should appreciate this.

            "review_title": "Meh",
            "content": "TLDR: The title of my review sums up the entire film in my opinion, it is lacklustre, predictable and all round rushed.I'd first like to discuss the camerawork in this film; its pretty trash for the first half. The first scene literally makes no sense regarding the camerawork, its shoddy with the common mistake of having the secondary camera take on the properties of the primary such as featuring the chat and reactions (this is while Addison is doing an live stream), however they do this fix this later in the film which it isn't that large of a point, they fix this by adding the chat and reactions to the sides of a wider display while having Addison film in vertical, which I feel is a far more realistic setup and an actual improvement. This film often feels like there were 2 directors or at times the director would just leave the set because the first half is far worse than the second. Another point on the camerawork for this film is that it is ameuter and frankly poor at times. While Addison and her mother are having breakfast the camera is shaking constantly the scene is unwatchable and I was thinking it was to reflect that Addison was in a rush or something but she clearly has rigid schedule and the only delay was having a chat with her mother. Another critique would be the fight scene; here the angles are terrible, but like below standard and I feel if they worked on the camera work for this scene it could've turned into a proper highlight of the film but it just ruined the scene for me.The Writing: honestly not bad, despite being a very predictable plot with some holes in the writing it actually presented a relatively premise in a moderately watchable style. I feel the writing and plot doesn't get as much credit as it deserves. From the second act where the bet is made that Addison would transform Tanner's character we know that as there relationship develops there would be eventual reveal that the only reason Addison is interested in him is because is a bet. However the unnecessary antagonizing of Alden's character is kind of out of left field so to speak. On one hand Alden is established to be sort of a veiled antagonist as her and Addison had been pitted against one another due to the bet and obviously the stakes were as high as 2 spoiled kids could place them. However the writers believed that adding another motive of just jealousy needed to be added and Alden just becomes a heinous and unwatchable character, shaming poverty and nurses which I felt was beyond uncalled for and unnecessary. The main antagonist for the first half was also pretty poorly written with a moderate critique on the immunity of an absurdly famous personality which brings me to a side point which is the unbelievability of this school; which is expanded on during the search for the bet person. There are too many bums and over successful people. The only middle ground characters are Tanner's sister and friend. There are literally no other characters who aren't either geniuses or internet-phenomenons or drug dealers. Also I simply cannot believe that these people are seniors like Jordan looks 25. Additionally they felt the need for Addison and Tanner's friends to get together, you know, just cause they're gay so they should be together, it was kinda unnecessary but I'd be lying if I didn't guess that the second it was revealed that both were gay. However that is about all the conflicts with the plot the rest follows a relatively steady if anything rushed pace as alot of these plots lead nowhere like they turn the whole Alden plotline into a joke that she wasn't even in the running for Prom Queen. While Jordan's popularity appears untouched even though that was supposed to be a massive plot point while also completely ignoring Tanner's popularity which turned into an absolutely ad hoc plot point of people filming his fight.Addison Rae: ruined this film, her acting is bland, unemotional and all round terrible. She acts as though it were a skit or joke; she looks as though she is rushing or barely knows her lines or had to have someone read her lines to her during shooting because her delivery is so off at some points. In other situations I simply don't like her delivery because the lines are cliche and cringe but that's just my reaction to it and shouldn't really be considered a review point. Addison shouldn't act anymore or if she did she really needs to learn how to act because I personally have never seen a worse display.Tanner Buchanan: loved him Cobra Kai, and kinda love him here, he was a serious redeemer of this film but there a lot of things that are simply not explained about his character, he has crazy abs just because, and he has serious fighting proficiency just because. Despite this his acting was fantastic and he really played the antisocial role well.Matthew Lillard. Another serious highlight of this film, his performance was masterful and a genuine redemption for the first half of the film.In conclusion, this film was meh, it tried too hard to be a tv show and not a film, it introduces unnecessary relationships and conflicts which just took and screen time and led to a 1hour 30 film feeling incredibly rushed with simply not enough focus on the main plot which was to make Tanner prom king; I guarantee that if you ask anyone what the bet was after watching this film they won't remember because the directors forgot. Nonetheless even though Addison is terrible, removing her from this film, its not bad. After it is a rom com, not much you can do with that.",

So, for a remake to be full of 2020 cliches, cheesy, and predictable wasn't exactly a big issue. The ''big difference'' is only a gender-swap between the leads. Now we have Padget (played by Tik-Toker Addison Rae), a popular girl who makes a bet that she could turn a nerdy guy Cameron (Tanner Buchanan) into a next prom king. If you've seen not only the original, but basically any rom-com in the last 30 years, you'll guess 85% of where this is going. Still, this sub-genre isn't exactly known for its creativity, no? It serves to shut your brain off for awhile and have fun. So, if you enjoy stuff like The Kissing Booth Trilogy, Tall Girl, or any of the Noah Centineo Netflix films, this will do. It's okay that it uses the social media concepts to update the plot, but it went too far in relying on it for my taste. The actors did fine for what they had to, and there is a nice moment or a funny joke now and then. It is still a predictable teen rom-com, so don't set your expectations too high, but it's not a godawful film either.",

            "content": "I'm gonna be completely honest... if I could go back, yes I would watch it again. But only for like 3 or 4 of the actors.To start off, there was WAY too much music used for unnecessary reasons that I can't even begin to imagine why. Like it wasn't even good soundtrack music. If there was music playing in the background of a character doing something, such as a kiss, I would expect not \"in your face\" fast paced music. I would expect slower and I guess quieter paced music. Some made sense but others? Not really.Secondly, I'm a sucker for romcoms, right? The original was a romcom. This one? Not really. There was maybe one funny part about the whole movie. They tried but it was a valiant effort that just came short.Third, I'm so beyond disappointed in the casting. I was giving it the benefit of the doubt at first but I don't like the acting like at all. The only actors that I could really lose myself in were Tanner Buchanan, Madison Pettis, Isabelle Crovetti, and of course the original actors that were present. It was painfully obvious that Addison Rae was acting for one. There were others as well but as the main character, I expected more. I wanted to get lost in it but I just couldn't because you could tell it was scripted.As a remake? This movie was absolutely butchered. However, if you think about it as it's own movie and you go into it expecting a \"Netflix cheesy movie with bad acting\" you might get more what you're looking for. I was so beyond disappointed because the original is one of my favorite movies. I knew going into it that it wasn't going to be the original but I wanted to like it.I'm only leaving it as 3 stars because of the original stars and the fact that Tanner Buchanan really gave me the Laney vibe I wanted so desperately to see in his character. He really did an amazing job and bringing his character to life. I also really liked how Madison Pettis brought the Dean Sampson vibe back. I mean, she truly made me not like her character. Isabelle Crovetti also did a great job as being the little sister. And I truly wish I could've wanted to react the way she did at the end of the movie.",

Addison Rae already does this in her daily life, didn't need to make it into a movie! Addison Rae, the acting skills are horrible. I'm not trying to be mean or rude but the only reason why she got a roll to begin with is because she's TikTok famous! It felt as if I was watching a 1 hour and 30 minute TikTok video! Not everyone that becomes famous due to social media should be a senior actor. It seems that everyone is transitioning into that, I believe everybody is good at some thing. But not everybody should go into things like that because it does not work out for them. Overall this movie was so bad and the fact that some actors from the original \"She's All That\" are in this reboot/remake but they had nothing to do with their roles from the original. I'm very happy that Freddie Prince Jr., Was not in this because that would be the biggest fail and disappointment in his acting career.",

Kourtney kardashian - what was her part? Strange and seemed as though Addison just got her friend a random part in the film, could've left her character out completely with no detriment.4. The fight scene - although tanner is good its too cliche with the air kick (made 0 sense why he knew those moves but of course because of Cobra Kai they had to put it in there).5. Tanner riding in on a horse at the end even though he said he was in the room watching her speech.6. The whole \"hiding being poor thing\" - it barely gets mentioned and yet they make out like it's such an issue at the end \ud83e\udd23 Tanner and Addison don't even have 1 scene where its discussed.7. The constant talk about followers and social media referencing - we get she's a famous tiktok girl but wasn't the point in the film to become an actress who's taken seriously?Overall Tanner definitely did the best he could but my god it was so rushed, so cringey and so...aimed at 10 year olds. Had potential so it's a shame!

A lot of people are saying how horrible Addison Rae was and I'm just wondering if we saw the same movie? She was pretty good for a girl with no prior acting skills, very natural and believable and honestly carried the movie. Tanner Buchanan on the other hand can't act- it's actually painful to watch (and I love Cobra Kai) but this kid is like a wooden stick or robot, just horrible!

I think this movie was a breath of fresh air and is a great way to relate to the younger generations. It is 2021. There is TikTok, there is vlogging. That is life today and there's no reason that it can't be portrayed the way it is in this movie. People are rejecting it because it's different. Which is also what the movie is trying to say....it's ok to be different.Also, I thought the cast did a great job. There are many other movies or shows that have some corny scenes or lines. It makes it more fun. Have an open mind and stop hating on everything. I'd definitely recommend this movie to others and I would watch again a million times.",

And if you watch Cobra Kai, you'll probably be a fan of her male counterpart as well.Overall it was very easy to watch and not too cringe.The fact that this is my first review in my 10+ years of being an IMDB subscriber is a testament to how the film was more average than awful.Normally I'd rate it between a 5&6, but I'm giving it an 8 to boost the average.People love to hate.",

After an untimely live feed, Padgett's life starts to spiral out of control. To help get her back on top, she decides to turn the school's social outcast, Cameron Kweller (Tanner Buchanan), into prom king.Since this is a remake, the story isn't that original. The writing team did a good job of updating it and making it relevant for today's audience. The use of social media connects well with viewers. The sets throughout the film are what stand out the most in the production. The wardrobes, specifically for Buchanan, were another area of success for the film.The acting is bearable with some performances that stand above others. Buchanan and Rae have good chemistry throughout. Some bit parts worked well and moved the plot along as they were intended to. It was a nice touch to add Rachael Leigh Cook and Matthew Lillard to the cast, even though they did not reprise their roles for the original film. As Principal Bosch, Lillard stole the show.This film could have worked under a different name if some tweaks were made. Some marks were missed throughout and minor adjustments could have helped this film. Nothing production wise really stood out. Unfortunately, this film feels like everyone was running through the motions to complete a film with no originality to it. Doing the social media framing device was clever, but it has also become redundant in today's films.He's All That doesn't bring anything new to the table, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it. There are well timed jokes, a sense of nostalgia, and some characters you can get behind. While it may not linger in your mind for days after viewing, you will have a good time watching it.",

Addison was definitely, not bad, but is that enough for such a high production movie? However I feel like even with a different actress, the movie would still be kinda the same.Really I haven't seen anyone say this but the actual problem is the writing. The characters have the emotional depth of a chicken nugget and they pretty much have zero development throughout the movie. It is reminiscent of the good ol' 2000s' but not in a good way.On another note, the soundtrack was good, Addison and Tanners' chemistry was great and some scenes were definitely funny.Lastly, I think many would enjoy this movie going into it just for their monthly cheesy and cringy shot of energy.

Even that random TickTock chick gave a pretty solid performance which I wasn't expecting. I don't like tiktok- I think it's pretty cringe but I have to be fair in saying her acting skills are fine. I'm not the most sentimental person but there were a few scenes that actually got me going \"awww that's actually pretty sweet and heartwarming\". And some of the jokes and lines delivered were pretty funny and clever. The script writer was the same writer for the original \"she's all that\" so at least there is some consistency in the quality of storytelling. It was also nice to see Rachel Leigh Cook and Matthew Williard again albeit in different roles. Matthew was pretty funny as always. And Tanner Buchanan gave an impressive performance. Id say the one scene I didn't like was the dance scene at the prom. Honestly, the dance scene from the original was much better.

Think about that for a minute before hating on Addison. Plus, I bet you couldn't have done any better at acting, so don't even.

Why after all these years some filmmakers can't figure out how to be a little subtle is baffling, or just tell their bankrollers that less is more when it comes to product placement. Hitting people over the head with it doesn't inspire to buy, it does the opposite.",

The cast of the original was the only thing it had going for it. The remake suprisingly has a better setting.The post \"family vaule 98\" MTV generation period was a weird backdrop for the original. Making it flat, cynical, mean-spirted, and just kinda lame.Setting the remake in the tik\\tok- instragam generation actually made for a more interesting backdrop and plays to being a character itself \\story device (and an effective one) for the netflix remake.

I've seen a lot of hate towards Addison Rae and her performance but honestly she's doing a solid job through most of the movie, with some weaker moments but what did you expect. The production is smooth as in the story actually makes sense which in and of itself is more than could be said about some movies in this realm and the quality is better than I expected. The writing is solid and more importantly, the dialog actually feels natural for most of the movie. Which, again, is more than can be said about other similar movies.I never liked the original, always finding it too shallow and without any real depth. While this movie isn't the Mariana trench, it's at least a stream and not a puddle. The lead more so learns to embrace herself and falls in love with the guy for his personality and what he brings out in her rather than for the \"makeovered\" version she creates of him. (although, of course she finds the more put together, styled version more physically attractive, which isn't a weird thing. That's true for any and everyone. Humans prefer other humans who look put together, that's just how it is). Also, her qualms about her friends picking him for the bet isn't that he's ugly (as is supposed to be the case in the original) but rather because he is socially undesirable at school, constantly clashing with the popular kids, which will obviously get in the way of the popular vote for prom king.All in all, it's not an amazing movie but it managed to do what the original did not but movies like this should i.e. Make me feel good and as such it's a good update for the original. Now, the original has NOT aged well at all and this one maybe won't do any better in that department but then again it's solid enough now that I can't be mad at it.",

            "content": "Oh boy, there's a lot to unpack here. Let's lay our cards on the table, shall we? This movie was for me. I loved She's All That and know every line. We thought we were so cool and enlightened in our Williamson bubble of snappy and precocious teen dialogue. She's All That subverted expectations and convention with a no nonsense protagonist, sympathetic villains, a friggin awesome dance number, and our leading lady did NOT win the crown. Yes!I'm not saying the original is good, I'm just saying it's why I watched this movie, obviously. I put off watching this movie for a while. Look at the user reviews, the ratings, and the people involved, this was going to be a trainwreck, and to be fair, I'm not calling it a 'Little' trainwrech, but it did go off the rails a few times. I relented for a few reasons, morbid curiosity, nostalgia for RLC, and Lillard. I'm also a fan of Buchanan and his really good work in Cobra Kai, admittedly, that's his only work I'm familiar with. But that was it, otherwise, I only tuned in to validate my suspicions.This movie is bizarre, in the spirit of subverting expectations we went a little beyond gender swaps here in most places, in other places we stuck with it, we moved a couple of aspects around regarding the social economics structure, and have slightly fewer parents that exist in the teen comedy world. The bet is lame and doesn't pivot the action through the first plot point in an organic way, the antagonist is rotten and fails in comparison to an early career Paul friggin Walker!! (may he RIP). I'm sure most of the jarring oddities and forced dialogue was in context to my 1999 comparisons but I tried to watch this movie on it's face, which was just as hard even if it wasn't a a remake.Mark Waters directed this movie, he also directed Mean Girls...What?! How do you get so dispirit results from someone who obviously has an ear for the teenage voice, is this just about the script? The editing is all over the place and I felt like connecting story elements were deleted. Characters were in different places without transition or context and I was confused about the character's motivations a lot while watching this. We know the script is trash but that doesn't explain the direction, editing, production design, world-building, and continuity issues. At one point Buchanan busted out his greatest karate hits as well...for some reason. Why?! I make a mean banana bread but that doesn't mean it should be put into a scene, especially an important plot point scene that drives the homecoming king portion of the bet (that doesn't have nearly enough weight in this movie as it should BTW).But I laughed...I laughed at four places in this movie, I kept track. These were not internal chuckles or chortles as if to say, \"huh, how amusing\". I laughed out loud and couldn't help it. The jokes were all delivered by Buchanan. I know he is still relatively early in his career but I like him. I fear that he will fall into the same trap as Britt Robertson, falling for his own hype. He's not that good but he shines against his costars, which doesn't mean much with projects like this.This movie had all the same trappings as The Duff but not as good of a central underlying theme, which is inexcusable for an almost shot for shot remake. I found myself wanting to watch The Duff instead of this which is never good for the movie in question.If you watch this movie for Buchanan, I think he is doing just fine, if you're watching for an updated version of She's All That, just watch the original, even if you're not of that generation it will be what you're after if you're considering watching this trash. RLC's presence in He's All That is not worth it, Lillard cracks one funny joke, after that I felt like he had worn out his cameo welcome, the only constant underlying theme with respect to the entire cast of this movie...tragic.",

So I watched it...Watched it and my main issue is that the characters really lacked emotion so it was hard for me to feel bad for the them and you can tell who they're trying to make their character come off as, felt a bit like watching a school play in the front of the class. Then many of the scenes looked like they got filmed in only 3 attempts and this movie didn't remind me of high school at all, the party and prom give off too much rich, famous, modern vibes plus many of the actors looked like they were over 25.I will give it that the movie is still watchable because the scenes do switch up quick enough. The characters at least do move around a lot instead of sitting in the same spot talking to each other back and forth for several minutes in a blank background (which botherd me in many movies/shows.)

The 2 leads bounced off each other without even coming up for air. Could've just been poor editing, but YIKES.It was bad.Just REALLY bad.IDK why people are surprised by the prom dance off.Same thing occurred in the original and I thought it was cringe AF back in '99 before \"CRINGE AF\" was even a thing!

Cam's character (played by Tanner Buchanan) was actually much better than I thought he'd be, he was surprisingly well written for a movie like this, and I actually related to him at times. Addison's character on the other hand was as generic as you could get in a movie like this, and even though you can tell she tried, she wasn't a very good actor at all, looking out of place in almost every scene she was in. I think one of the main problem of this movie is how cliche and predictable it is. I played a little game where I tried to guess what would happen next, and every single thing I guessed came true, the story is the exact same one we've seen in other Netflix teenage romance movies, and the \"villian\" is about as shallow as you can get.

Absolutely 150% NOTHING even close to the original, but are we really surprised? Lol. I tried going into this with high spirits considering She's All That is my mom's favorite movie, but sigh.

And especially a brat who thinks she's talented in everything when she ain't???? Poor guy had to force himself to have some nonexistant chemistry with her, and it's like she's reading directly from the script and for info THAT IS NOT ACTING , and don't let me begin on the weird camera angles and sponsorships and the nonsense that a Kardashian had to be in this, we don't want stupid gen Z cliches, we want a real movie with a consistent plot and characters with PERSONALITIES and actors that make us jump in the movie and feel like we're watching real people's lives. I also want to say that my review isn't based on my hate for Addison, and that some of the actors had talent but it wasn't enough to save the movie \ud83d\ude14",

Very typical and if you don't like it, then obviously it's not the genre for you. It was nice to see the main girl character from the original. There were some funny moments and I loved the side WLW relationship.However, Addisons acting was mediocre at best. Was very stiff and when it wasn't stiff, it felt like a little bit too much, especially with the constant head nodding. The karaoke scene was somewhat nice, however the tiktok dancing completely ruined it and upped the cringe factor. As well as the dance off. It doesn't make sense to me how someone so against people (in this case; the main guy) would just automatically jump in the karaoke to help out someone, and would also allow her to just cut his hair. Wouldn't he have had his hair that long for a reason? It could just be me over thinking though.Overall, it has some good aspects and some bad aspects. Me, being someone who enjoys the cliche rom coms, liked it. But there were many things about it that I didn't like.",

And, in this days, tiktok and other social medias are what they like, that's simple. I'm a nostalgic too - I watched She's All That because of this, not because it's a masterpiece - but I try to forget nostalgia when I'm watching a high school movie from 2021.I could give it a 7, even an 8, but what did they do with Kiss Me exceeded the limits of my goodwill.

It was so painful to watch him on the tv I actually felt a couple of my brain cells dying while watching him \"acting\".in my opinion, you can find better acting in the cheapest Mexican, Turkish or any low badges soap.

You can't redo a classic. In fact, I would've given this one star, but I gave one extra star for Rachel Leigh Cook & one extra star for Matthew Lillard. Otherwise, the entire premise is a snooze fest - influencer gets snubbed by boyfriend & loses her sponsorship. And who hired the Kardashian for god's sake? She can't act to save her life, yet she gets multiple cameos. Did she sponsor the movie or something? Or did her mother sponsor it?Overall I give 1 star, but the fact that there are 2 original actors from the actual classic, I gave this abomination 2 additional stars.

I did cringe at the dance scenes and a moment at the end when Cameron comes riding up to the high school on a horse. At least they showed a truck and horse trailer in the background so it seemed more believable cheesey in that moment.I think the 1 star reviews are incredibly unfair and perhaps only so because of 'tiktok' hate. I'm in my 30's and looking at this objectively I would normally rate it a 6. Pleasing, cutesy, teen rom com. I would even watch it again. Rated a 10 to balance the absurd 1 star reviews.",

This movie was pretty much what it claims to be, in all regards, and if you set your expectations properly before ever hitting play.Cons: Maybe there's no avoiding it, but influencer culture is so depressing, so I hated that aspect of the movie; I hate that aspect of modern society, too, so that was never going to be a win for me.Pros: Tanner Buchanan is really growing as an actor, and I hope that he continues getting roles, and catches the attention of casting directors outside of the scope of Netflix. I liked him in Cobra Kai, but thought his acting there was a little forced, and lacking; I was pleasantly surprised with his performance here! Seriously... a lot of growth, and I will be glad to see him continue to get roles.Also... the addition of Rachael Leigh Cook and Matthew Lillard, plus the Sixpence None the Richer song \"Kiss Me,\" was a bit of fun for watchers of the original film. Found myself feeling more nostalgic than I expected, and that's from someone who, as I mentioned before, was not really a huge fan of \"She's All That\".This movie hits the marks/checks the boxes, if you're expecting a teen rom com, and not a Scorsese movie. If you're looking for a lot of depth or a challenging film, obviously look elsewhere. If you're looking for a formulaic movie that's the equivalent of junk food, this title is fun enough.",

Also let me let my girl lady gaga and beyonce know that i love them and to make sure that their water glasses are always full because you are going to the met gala (walmart version clearly) as a waitress on my momma. I wanna give a shoutout to the bruhs grandma who somehow survived the filming of this cardiac arrest of a movie.",

I've seen his other performances and he can act pretty well. He pretty much carried the entire movie.Overall it was an alright movie. It was cute, clich\u00e9, and definitely guided more towards young teens. If you don't like typical teenage high school movies, then stay away.

If you want to see what I mean by haters, go look at the demographic on who is rating this ones, females under 18 who probably haven't even seen the original.If you saw the original you'd appreciate this a lot more. The woman who plays the mom was the original \"She's All That\". The acting was fine for a teen movie. I really think a lot of the reviewers here just hate that a Tiktok star is making it big. I also liked the plot and thought the chemistry was good!",

She has absolutely zero emotion but that's why it was so funny. Plot was pretty decent, obviously, because its from a 90's movie. I could actually muster some hate and liking towards some of the characters so at least there's that. They definitely could have gotten someone different than addison but come on she's the only reason we watched it lets be real. It wasnt THAT bad. Random? Yes. Cringy? At times. Enjoyable?

The acting by a non-actress was bad and her character was still trash at the end.I feel bad that these BS rolls are the kinds of things they are offering tanner buchanan because he is actually good young actor.Netflix could have done much better on the remake, tanner buchanan was still a good choice for the character but the old cast should have been their old characters. And maybe Laney's kid should have been tanner buchanan's character because it would have made more sense based off Laney being the artist mom.
