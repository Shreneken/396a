            "content": "Nicolas Cage has steadily built a reputation for being a kooky actor, with recent performances seeing him dialling the craziness up to eleven; Sion Sono is a director who seems to be trying to outdo Takashi Miike in terms of surreality. Prisoners of the Ghostland, from the producers of Mandy, sees Cage and Sono teaming up to bring us what has to be the most thoroughly contrived piece of bizarre cinema I have ever seen. It's wall-to-wall weirdness, but everything feels so meticulously calculated to confound that it proves irksome in the extreme.The basic plot sounds like exploitation heaven: when wealthy warlord The Governor (Bill Moseley) discovers that his adopted granddaughter Bernice (Sofia Boutella) has hightailed it into the badlands, he springs a notorious criminal (Cage) from jail and offers him his freedom if he can bring the missing girl back. To ensure compliance, the criminal is fitted with a leather jumpsuit with explosives fitted to the neck, arms and groin, which will explode if he fails to follow orders.Sadly, Sono's approach makes the movie an impenetrable mess, every frame an exercise in the absurd - if the aim was to make a film guaranteed to bore, irritate and confuse in equal measures, then he succeeded. The director captures some stunning visual compositions with breath-taking use of colour, which makes it all the more frustrating that nothing in the film makes any sense, and most of it is just plain annoying. I have my suspicions that Cage didn't know what was going on either, but he was probably just grateful for the pay check, and does his crazy routine obligingly.1/10. By all means watch if you absolutely have to see Cage holding his own bloody testicle after it has been blown off by one of the suit bombs, but don't say I didn't warn you.",

            "content": "That was director Sion Sono's vision, and he did not disappoint putting it on film.However, having actors-turned-wannabe-writers Aaron Hendry and Reza Sixo Safai with barely to no writing experience come up with this screenplay, was wackadoodle. I got annoyed with the number of production companies displayed in the opening credits, you'd think at least one would've invested in a seasoned writer to at least look over the final script. Safi and Hendry wrote a bunch of incoherent, convoluted, plot-hole and technical-issue riddled nonsense.The 103 min runtime, sub-par pacing, and many long dragged out and unnecessary scenes, made this film seem like it was 3+ hours long.Luckily, with Sono's directing and Sohei Tanikawa's near-perfect cinematography, the eye-candy sets, crazy costumes and props, and stunning visuals kept me hooked. The score was fitting and on point. The casting and performances were excellent, especially Nicolas Cage (who this role was made for) and Sofia Boutella.It's a shame no one babysat the writers, as this could've easily been a cult classic. But as is, I'm thinking this would've been a much better music video backdrop for Pink Floyd or Metallica album. It's a very generous 6/10 from me.",

Does he even read the scripts? Or is it just about money for him? Will he just do anything as long as you pay him? Prisoners Of The Ghostland is another movie with Nicolas Cage that is painful to watch. Not visually though, that was actually fine and that's why I scored it with three stars, but the story, or more the lack of a comprehensible story, that's what makes this movie bad. Nothing makes really sense, you almost know it from the start but you continue watching it in the hope something will change, but it doesn't...

There is also some kind of Ghost in the middle.Nothing really makes any sense; stages have a na\u00efve style like in 60s movies, acting is unbearable (Cage seems to be fooling around). The rest are cartoonish.Sofia Boutella tries but it is impossible for her to save this mess.If you see the comedy \"The Play that went wrong\" well is basically the same but without any comedy intent.Sion Sono has made some interesting movies in his country Japan and perhaps this have some kind of cultural meaning; but in America is just shamefully absurd for everybody including the viewers.Do not lose your time unless you have to see it to believe it.",

            "content": "Sure, the poster/cover for \"Prisoners of the Ghostland\" definitely looks really interesting, I will say that much. And yeah, I opted to sit down and watch this 2021 movie given the fact that it was a new movie that I hadn't already seen, and also because it has Bill Moseley on the cast list.Well, \"Prisoners of the Ghostland\" is a strange movie, even for a Nicolas Cage movie. Even by his standards, then this movie is out there, way, way out there. From the whacked out storyline to the insanely bizarre imagery, props, costumes and sets.I found the storyline in \"Prisoners of the Ghostland\", as written by Aaron Hendry and Reza Sixo Safai, to be very odd and bizarre. It was so far out there that the movie suffered from it, as it grew annoyingly and frustratingly tough to sit through, as most of the things made little to no sense, or was just so wacky that you just don't get it.The acting in the movie was as to be expected. I wish that Bill Moseley would have been given more on-screen time, because he was - hands down - the best thing about the movie. Sure, it was nice to see Sofia Boutella on the screen, but she seemed to be running on auto-pilot. And this was, for better or worse, just another notch in the strange movie career of Nicolas Cage.The characters and the dialogue throughout the course of \"Prisoners of the Ghostland\" was pretty bad, and that reflected rather poorly on the overall movie.I am sure that there is an audience out there for director Sion Sono's movie \"Prisoners of the Ghostland\". But as it happened to be, then I wasn't the target audience. And I can't claim to have found much enjoyment or entertainment in this particular movie.My rating of \"Prisoners of the Ghostland\" lands on a generous two out of ten stars.",

Even the visual quality of the movie would need some serious editing and reworking - everything looks like some takes from pre-production status. How Nicolas Cage and Sofia Boutella got involved into this movie, I can't understand. For sure, Prisoners of the Ghostland is not the worst movie ever but rather a disappointing and unsatisfying experience. Not recommended, or only to those who want to watch everything that got Cage and/or Boutella casted. This is not a trip on acid but rather a hangover after a night with too much cheap beer involved.",

Hero's former partner Psycho (Nick Cassavetes) is a real psycho.This is Escape from New York and Judge Dredd and whatever craziness coming out of director Sion Sono's brain. Nick Cage is doing more of his weirdness and I applaud him. I want to him all the room he needs. In this case, it's too weird even for me. It gets unwieldy. There's one small example. In the first group tick tock moment, not everybody is moving their heads in the same way. Sono needs to sell that by doing disturbing unison movements. I'm willing to go with the weirdness but it has to be done better. This is style over control. This is walking on a knife's edge.

I already had them watered down by others. And even though I did not want to believe them, I have to admit, after watching this - it is rather weird if I were to put it mildly.It still is well done and shot - visually speaking it works. It still has a lot of Nic .. Cageirisms (or whatever you would want to call them). Especially when he holds a speech to rile people up ... while simultaneously cursing them out too.If that is enough for you and you don't mind the craziness - you could do worse. But if you do expect a bit more of a movie that has or rather could have been so much more ... well, do not feel too dissapointed ... unfortunately it was bound to happen (no pun intended).",

That said, the way that it's all put together seems almost random, and the story and script progression are just super weird. The dialogue very rarely makes sense or has any solid purpose, but I guess if you consider that the director Sion Sono has a background in poetry, the abstract dialogue is a bit more understandable.I applaud the studio for making something original and distinctive, which is harder to find these days. However, I wish they had done a lot more with the dialogue and story. You can't just string together random quotes and scenes and expect anything coherent to happen, no matter how good the stage and visuals are.",

            "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Nonsensical. Absurd. Ridiculous. Just plain stupid. These words usually serve to describe an incredibly awful movie that I try to forget forever and ever. However, some extremely rare pieces of absolutely crazy filmmaking are also characterized by the adjectives above, offering me the most entertaining time I can possibly ask for. An example of this case is Prisoners of the Ghostland. It's exceptionally dumb, follows a narrative completely devoid of any logic, and mixes up dozens of many genres by using different costumes, all sorts of epic scores, and character archetypes.Boasting an impressive production and set design (major Hollywood studios should be envious), Sion Sono offers the audience precisely what they expect from a film starring the maddest actor alive, Nicolas Cage. From the well-choreographed, well-edited, explosively bloody, hilarious action sequences to the infinite storylines, the viewers either accept whatever lunatic plot point or device the movie throws at the audience, or this is going to be a festival of pointing out what's wrong with the whole film. Prophecies, nuclear wars, zombies, samurais, cowboys... every generic development and formulaic characters we always see in every genre are present in this amalgam of pure chaos.As expected, Cage shines in another role that will probably generate thousands of new memes, but this time Sofia Boutella and Bill Moseley also deliver two captivating performances that kept me invested when Cage was out. The only problem I have with this type of movie is the balance of the whole craziness. I don't mind every single minute being packed with utterly ludicrous stuff, but when it starts getting genuinely confusing, that's when it becomes too much for me to handle. Nevertheless, as long as you keep your mind open and focus on the protagonist's main mission - and solely on that - you'll be able to enjoy this movie as much or more than I did.Prisoners of the Ghostland is everything a film starring Nicolas Cage is expected of being. Possessing technical attributes of making the biggest Hollywood studios shamelessly hide with envy, Sion Sono's movie is as illogical, absurd, ridiculous, stupid, and insanely entertaining as I hoped it would be. By mixing up dozens of distinct genres, the straightforward premise gets sucked into a world of total anarchy, where samurais, cowboys, nuclear explosions, modern cars, and much more collide to surround an otherwise simple narrative with nonsensically hilarious storylines and awesome action sequences. Sofia Boutella and Bill Moseley help Cage tackle this chaos, but the latter is the absolute standout due to his remarkable experience in crazy films. Despite it occasionally crossing the line and becoming too much for me to manage - it becomes seriously confusing - as long as the viewers are well-prepared to accept every jaw-dropping new development, fun is guaranteed with this brilliant satire.Rating: A-",

            "content": "Nicolas Cage. Seems like that's all it takes to garner instant interest in a film, as the actor has achieved living legend status in the eyes of many genre fans (and for good reason). In his latest, Prisoners of the Ghostland, Cage plays Hero, a ruthless, imprisoned bank robber set free by a wealthy warlord known as The Governor (Bill Moseley, even more to get excited about), and tasked with finding The Governor's kidnapped \"granddaughter\", Bernice (Sofia Boutella, always exciting, in more ways than one). Taking place in the post-apocalyptic Samurai Town, Cage's Hero is strapped in a leather suit set to self-destruct in 5 days, including detonators located in the vicinity of each testicle (testicuule, The Governor pronounces it), and encounters gunslingers, ghosts, samurai, and a crazed cult. The film puts Cage in an Escape From New York meets Big Trouble in Little China scenario, and the end result is a movie just as wild as you would imagine, an enormously entertaining adrenaline rush that brings the Cage Rage.Once the film is set up and our Hero is on his journey, the film has plenty of unexpected laughs and is very funny at times. It almost works as a spoof of the Western, action genre. \"What a badass,\" \"he's so cool,\" say a couple of awestruck onlookers as Hero chooses a dainty bicycle with a basket instead of the black sports car when he leaves on his journey. He does eventually end up with he car because, tick tock, the clock is ticking on that deadly leather jumpsuit.While looking for Bernice, Hero is lead to a torched, windswept landscape with crumbling mannequins swaying back and forth, cracked and broken shells that conceal prisoners inside of them. Every turn in this world holds a different danger, a threat to end Hero's life at any moment. And all of this is handled with such confidence by director Sion Sono, creating a thrilling and playful and insane world of filthy neon. Imagine Mad Max as a supernatural Samurai Western.In the middle of all this madness is Nicolas Cage, wonderfully off the wall and right at home in such a place. It feels as though the film was inspired by Cage's reputation playing odd characters, giving the film a match-made-in-heaven quality. If Cage gives Prisoners of the Ghostland it's unlikely (anti) hero, it's Sofia Boutella as Bernice who gives the movie its glimmer of hope. It's Bernice we root for as she's the possibility for a brighter future in the Ghostland. What an exquisite performance from Boutella alongside the scene stealing Cage.There's a religious-like fixation on time in the Ghostland. The inhabitants hold the giant clock displayed on the bones-like structure of an old capital building at 8:14, fearing if it hits 8:15 the atomic blasts will once again wreak havoc. The people who live under The Governor refer to him as a clock, as time itself. In the Ghostland, everyone is a prisoner to a forgotten existence, to a lifestyle lost. Time has vanished for the prisoners of the Ghostland, only recognizable in the form of their rulers. This fixation with time really pushes Hero's race against the clock to the forefront, as well as any hope the future of the Ghostland has left.Prisoners of the Ghostland presents a unique vision from filmmaker Sion Sono ( it would make for a great double feature with Ana Lily Amirpour's The Bad Batch). A bloody, dirty, balls to the wall, gorgeous looking blast of color, chaos, and redemption in a land of hopelessness. Nicolas Cage leans into his Nicolas Cage persona, Bill Moseley has fun as a smooth talking, white suit wearing cowboy, and Sofia Boutella steals the show with a subdued, beautifully heartfelt performance. Big time entertainment, Prisoners of the Ghostland is a must see.",

It could even gain a cultstatus, but that's about all I can say that is positive about it.Unfortunately this movie is another FAILED attempt by the (brilliant) Nicholas Cage to star in a good movie. He has been starring in a lot of inferior B-movies lately, but occasionally he does create a new gem, so I am always on the lookout for new Nicholas Cage movies.This movie though can best be forgotten OR be turned into ANOTHER internet meme or into a cult movie...Below are some fun facts about this legendary actor, who has even become an internet meme.His uncle wrote and directed \"The Godfather\" (1972). Cage was married to the daughter of Elvis Presly. He has named his son \"Superman\". He discovered and introduced Johnny Depp to acting when he was his neighbour. His favorite movie is \"The Wizard of Ozz\" (1939). He lives in the former home of John Wayne.And he always sleeps in Swedish pyjamas, which he stores in the freezer. He once woke up in his bed in the middle of the night to find a naked man eating a fudgesicle in front of his bed. He didnt press charges. One of his wishes is \"to be Bob Denver on acid playing the accordion\".These are the lesser weird trivia facts about the life of Nicholas Cage, many much wilder gossip stories are out there for those who are interested.But Nicholas Cage is firstmost a brilliant actor, who got famous for his big action movies, but he has made much better, smaller pictures that are truly marvellous among which:\"Moonstruck\" (1987), \"Red Rock West\" (1993), \"Kiss of Death\" (1995), \"Leaving Las Vegas\" (1995), \"Adaptation\" (2002), \"Matchstick Men\" (2003) and his latest brilliant comedy \"The unbearable weight of massive talent\" (2022).Nicholas Cage is still THE MAN.

Among the bright spots here is the rather enjoyable and over-the-top sense of theatrics found in the rituals on display. Most of this comes from the utterly freaky and bizarre way the town lives, dressing like an apocalyptic band of road warriors, engaging in elaborately choreographed rituals, and outfitting captives in plastic pieces resembling disjointed mannequins while living in the squalor of an abandoned factory while spouting off ramblings of some strange curse involving an accident with nuclear waste creates an intriguing initial premise to work off. As well, when it offers up some action in a sword-fight of hand-to-hand encounter the gore here isn't too bad, but overall these are about all the film has going for it. There are some issues to be had with this one. The main drawback featured here is that, since so much of this is revealed so late into the running time, far too much of the film makes no sense. The band of outlaws living in the abandoned town with their rules and rituals creates a simplistic enough setup but there's nothing about how they tie into the group living in the town under the thumb of the maniacal governor who is constantly barking bizarre orders and commands to the obedient women at his feet or his servants. Even less sense is how the three separate factions are even connected with vague ramblings and nonsensical preachifying making use of just about everything taking place here in an attempt to bring these elements together which fails to do so. The other factor on display here is that there's so little action here it becomes dull and boring after a while. So little of this one features anything remotely resembling what could've been a fun, wild post-apocalyptic style feature involving the fight between a peace-seeking tribe of people stuck in the desert under siege by a roving band of mutated creatures prowling the desert. This one spends so much of its running time on other factors that there's very little interesting here that by the time it finally gets to the big battle at the end to take down the one in charge it's not interesting anymore and just comes off as a violent battle because that's the way the story has to end rather than tying itself together. All told, these features manage to bring the film down significantly from what it could've been.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",

I felt like I was in a Redlettermedia's \"Best of the Worst\". Never have I laughed so much and so hard at parts of a film that I did not think were intentionally funny. Never have I ever face palmed so many times or had to stop a movie due to pure confusion. Not confusion due to complexity or something like that but due to wondering \"why\" as in why did the filmmaker chose any of this? This film is astonishingly absurd and not in a good way.There was one scene that just screamed Mandy and low and behold this film is from the makers of Mandy. I did not like Mandy, Pig, tolerated Willie's Wonderland and skipped Color Out of Space. I'm coming to the conclusion that I just don't like Cage or his acting anymore. I don't really blame him though. The Rock, Con Air and Face Off will always be classics to me but this is pure grade A nonsense. I never put spoilers in my reviews but for this film I just have to mention something that happens in the begin that really doesn't spoil anything but if you are adverse this is your spoiler alert. Cage is given a car to go on his timed quest. He gets out of the car and takes a beat-up bike and everyone thinks he is so cool. At this point I thought the film was going to be intentionally funny and self aware. Nope, he gets about a hundred feet and is stopped by someone who throws him the keys to the same car. He than drives the car...What!? I am still so baffled.Anyways this is getting too long so if you like films that focus on Asian culture, Cage, decent scenery and camera work you might enjoy this more than me but I think I'm being way too generous giving this a 4.

Dick's The Man in the High Castle, the Japanese obsession with American culture runs deep, and Sono fuses the two sensibilities here - a frontier western mashed with a feudal samurai drama.On another level, Prisoners of the Ghostland is exploring the nuclear and cultural fallout of the atomic bombs that fell during World War II, as the movie searingly depicts in its final act. The ghosts of this movie are a slaves to that act, as they are slaves to time as commanded by Bill Moseley's deified Governor.Then there are the visual motifs and homages. It's no coincidence Nic Cage's Hero is dressed much like Max Rockatansky, and Mad Max II is clearly a reference point, another film haunted by the remnants of society in a dystopian wasteland. There's even echoes of The Wizard of Oz.Prisoners of the Ghostland will puzzle many and delight some, but ultimately it's a far more layered and intelligent piece of filmmaking than most will give it credit for.

So what the heck people?Now to begin with, the story is pretty razor thin. Basically, Nic Cage needs to rescue a concubine from an evil redneck who goes by the moniker \"The Governor.\" As Cage tries to track her down with a plethora of bombs strapped to his body, Cage traverses the fine line between a post apocalyptic wasteland and an Asian extreme nightmare. Cage stumbles into a weird society trying to survive, mostly by holding back a clock and keeping time from moving forward. It's a bizarre premise, but it works. And that is it. That's the story. Aside from some offshoot scenes to show how dangerous certain individuals are, there is not much left to talk about.I will say this...the movie is visually out there. Mixing elements from World Gone Wild and The Good, The Bad and the Weird, the visual aesthetic mixes westerns, Japanese period pieces and DIY post apocalypse. It doesn't always work but it looks wild. In the end, that is the saving grace, because the only real weakness was the script. While I have no issue with reading subtitles, I'm sure the pressure to get foreigners to speak English to help with the marketing was not really necessary. Part of the problem was understanding the character's speech, which was a challenge at some points due to the massive number of people shouting all together.Overall, between the four main films that XYZ Films has made, this is arguably the weakest. Cage obviously took this one due to the self indulgence of the character, which is fine by me. Oh well, at least it was cool to look at.",

Lovecraft's novella \"The Color Out of Space\" (2019), Cage played a conflicted father whose house sat on a portal to Hell. Afterward, he made the haywire occult comedy \"Willy's Wonderland\" (2021) where he uttered not one word of dialogue and waged a war against demonically possessed robots in a Chuck E. Cheese style rec center. Preposterous cockamamie from fade-in to fadeout, Japanese director Sion Sono's \"Prisoners of the Ghostland\" qualifies as so bad that it might be good, depending on your tolerance for its frivolous, infantile escapades. Quoting Cage: \"It might be the wildest movie I've ever made, and that's saying something.\"\nNow, in his first English-language film, Sono casts Cage as an anonymous bank robber given an opportunity to redeem himself. The first half-hour unfolds in Samurai Town, a cross-cultural synthesis of an ancient Japanese village and an American Wild West cattle town. The authorities are Asians dressed like Marshal Matt Dillon's deputies on TV's \"Gunsmoke.\" The town teems with giggling, kimono-clad geishas, pistol-packing Old West cowboys, and swashbuckling, katana-toting Yakuza warriors. The Governor's agile bodyguard, Yasujiro (Tak Sakaguchi of \"Yakuza Weapon\"), wields his razor-sharp katana like a demented wizard. The brief sword-fighting interludes evoke memories of bloodthirsty Asian martial arts epics. The dreaded Ghostland sprawls on the outskirts of Samurai Town and evoked memories of the dystopian, post-apocalyptic, \"Mad Max\" movies. Basically, chaos erupted when our nameless protagonist and his trigger-happy accomplice stormed into the Bleufleur National Bank and carried out an audacious daylight robbery. During this ill-fated fracas, Psycho (Nick Cassavetes of \"Blind Fury\") blew away eight innocent bystanders. One of the casualties was an adorable little boy who collected gumballs.Now, many years later, the ruler of Samurai Town, the Governor (Bill Moseley of \"The Devil's Rejects\"), a sleazy good ole boy with a countrified Foghorn Leghorn drawl, releases the bank robber from captivity. Clearly, the Governor dreams of being as villainous as Boss Hogg on \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" and attires himself in similar white apparel with boots and a Stetson. He wants Cage's character to infiltrate the Ghostland and find one of his euphemistic \"granddaughters.\" Actually, a courtesan in his harem, Bernice (Sofia Boutella of \"The Mummy\") sought her freedom, stole a car, and careened off into a landlocked Bermuda Triangle of phantoms. Although he believes the bank robber can retrieve Bernice, the Governor takes no chances. Not until our anonymous protagonist has zippered himself up into a black leather jumpsuit and snapped all the latches shut, does the evil Governor enlighten him about the explosive charges at his throat, elbows, and genitals. Indeed, this booby-trapped outfit could vaporize him if he tries to go AWOL! Anybody remember John Carpenter's cult sci-fi thriller \"Escape from New York\" (1981) where Kurt Russell's Snake Plissken fought the clock to rescue the President and receive the remedy for the poison in his body? The Governor promises our hero a reprieve if he delivers Bernice within five days. As it turns out, the \"Ghostland\" of the title is actually a nuclear wasteland. Incredibly, we're told that a bus carrying prisoners collided with a truck hauling nuclear waste, and the cataclysmic destruction irradiated the desert outside Samurai Town! Now, anybody who enters the Ghostland is forever trapped within its eerie confines. Some prisoners disguise themselves like department store mannequins while others struggle to turn back the hands of time on a monumental clock tower.A lukewarm, post-apocalyptic, supernatural, samurai western, \"Prisoners of the Ghostland\" depicts our hero's derring-do as he rescues Bernice but sacrifices some of his body parts. \"Suicide Club\" director Sion Sono and writers Aaron Hendry & Reza Sixo Safai must have been flying high on nitrous oxide when they concocted this psychobabble pabulum. Sono deprives the Nicolas Cage hero of any dignity. For example, when the Governor parades Cage from prison into the public, our hero is dressed like a sumo wrestler, with his haunches hanging out of a grimy thong. Similarly, Cage mocks his own image in \"The Rock\" (1996), \"C0n Air\" (1997), and \"Face/Off\" (1997) and often gets what he deserves when he behaves like a lout. Screwing up accidentally, he sets off an explosive crotch stud. BOOM! Predictably, our hero lost one for the team where it really counted. Few traditional heroes are made to suffer such ignominy. Later, after an explosion maims an arm, Cage augments that appendage, too. Happily, well-armed and quite angry, Bernice surprises the Governor. Altogether, a colorful Rorschach inkblot with richly symbolic imagery and ideology, \"Prisoners of the Ghostland\" will either enchant you with its grandiose farcicality or make you cringe in agony at its surreal shenanigans.",

            "review_title": "Against the odds, eventually it does come together",
            "content": "What is first pretty laborious, actually begins to coalesce into some themes along with a functional aesthetic, and an actual plot. I'm surprised as you. I was very close to bailing on this in the first 15-20 minutes.I have a few caveats before I get into my reading of this: Nicholas Cage was not good in this movie. The score was really forgettable; during the duel, arguably bad; and the script could have been a lot better. I feel like the director would have driven much of what was actually good to watch here, rather than pulling from the script like normal.So how did this become a 7? The town being ambiguous. Neither west nor east, felt like it was turning the orientalist aesthetic we see in much of sci-fi (especially cyberpunk) on its head. Here's some neon and some weird western brands lit up in Japanese architectural riffs. See how weird and kind of stupid it is?This feels like it ties into the white saviour angle. It had me puzzled for a while. Why is this person sent, of all people? He displays no real skill compared almost everybody else. But when we see that actually Bernice was not captive at all; she ran away and is now literally masquerading as something she is not within a mannequin. Trapped in a shell despite trying to find some kind of freedom. She has also lost her voice. Rather than someone capable, they send a white guy to return her, essentially a victim of sex trafficking, we find out later, to the white man governor. I think it's because it's assumed his morals would have no problem with it.And of course, the governor has no morals and has no intention of allowing him to go free, anyway. At which point the character we thought was mentally ill ends up trying to save her friend and show more moral fibre than anyone has so far. A nice touch, considering she is basically demeaned throughout until this time.By listening to his conscience in a kind of restorative Justice, Cage is able to actually be an effective fighter and enable the actually wronged party, Bernice, to kill the governor, who represents the institution that has imposed its will on this town. Where time has literally not been allowed to continue until his death.The only part that feels thematically discordant to me is the samurai warrior who is clearly better than everyone else, who fights to have his sister released from the Governor, ends up wanting to kill Cage, and dies at his hand. I'm guessing the samurai was the little boys brother, or something? I wasn't sure why he had to be the one to kill Cage and defended him until the duel; unless it was merely to see who was better. If so, that's pretty boring for a B plot, tbh.Anyway, I liked that Cage's freedom comes at the hands of Bernice. There was no indulgent sex scene and the only one who looks like a fool-as most Asians are made to appear in cinema, especially in Westerns-was Cage. (Another reason he shouldn't have fought a samurai and win, tbh).Time starts again. The town will be able to flourish. And the former mentally ill person, who was probably just gaslit bu the governor and the only sane person reacting to all the wild stuff happening, doesn't die; subverting another trope.In the end, it comes together fairly well and has some interesting themes it's playing with. It's over-the-top and silly sometimes, but it has a point and it's trying to look and be it's own thing. I respect that. It's disappointing, however, how much better it could have been with a better script though. It could have actually been quite intelligent and more interesting.",

However, where the film suffers for me is that the plot feels almost \"clunky\" without any natural flow, events seem to just take place. This bizarre world also isn't established too well, and it felt as if there needed some form of exposition, not too much, but more than it gives. Nonetheless, this movie is exceptionally entertaining, despite its flaws, particularly thanks to Nic Cage's performance.",

It is so condescendingly bad that it becomes insulting and a clear waste of time.The time I spent with this movie made me feel like I was stuck hearing a flat-earther describe their evidence, or a destitute 'professional' gambler explain to you their \"system.\" I hated every second of it.I still want to believe that there was a point to it, because it was pretty. So I would watch it again with someone who understands it, and could point out in real-time all of the metaphors, and artistic story points that I obviously missed. For now, I still hate it. I completely understand the reviews that say they were angry while watching.",

The main attraction Nicolas Cage and all the other actors delivers a performance that just looks okay but doesn't give any feel on top of anything. Both the screenplay and editing are all over the place from the first act till the end. The story itself feels like puzzle pieces that are put together without any proper idea or vision. Director Sion Sono made a movie where the audience can pass their time watching it but when it comes to the presentation the audience will have a hard time connecting to anything because of how janky and cringy it looks. Overall its a movie you can totally skip watching or if you have time to waste then you can definitely give this a try.",

Id wager that his movies are the favorites of mass shooters.This was so bad that I couldn't even finish watching the trailer with its terrible dialogue and absurd plot which we've seen a million times. Covering up the lousy story with a lot of glitter and sci-fi silliness won't fix this liability; that would be like putting a bikini on a 95-year-old which doesn't make the person sexier, it simply highlights their flaws.The more movies like this that are presented to the public, the more I stay away from the TV and read books.",

The mix of dress styles from Japanese Kabuki theatre, Cowboy fashion, Hobo tattered rags, a bit of Cyberpunk and a blend of traditional Samurai clothing works splendidly. The Martial Arts sword fights were very well choreographed, as was the town Gunfight shoot out wild west style and was not a balance out of place at all.The whole visual scene is outstanding but alas the script and the story flow are sadly missing altogether! Its confusing, crazy, outlandish, disjointed, totally wacky and comes across as if its a bunch of escaped mental patients stoned out of their minds on LSD. And that is why it only gets a 4 star rating from me; as well as for the segments that make no sense, are boring or pointless. Its a huge world apart from the style of his last film, 'PIG', which I really liked, so I am very curious as to what on earth he will do for his next film!",

But if you are expecting this to be a standard film, following the standard rules of entertainment ..Instead Ghostland is a film where everything is too much. Everything is over the top. But those who wrote this, knew what they were doing. Example:\nThe super-obvious copy of the Escape From New York \"exploding capsules\" trick; you can either believe that whomever wrote that doesn't know about John Carpenter, or you can believe that they totally do, not only do they know John Carpenter, they also know Fritz Lang - and have a massive onscreen reference to Metropolis, that NOBODY from the audience of this film has watched. They reference Lone Wolf & Cub, and a ton of good-to-mediocre, but well known japanese \"period\" (i.e. Samurai) films, but also some American 60s, early 70s films as well, some from B&W era. And Mad Max, obviously.And see the incredible photography, the gorgeous sets, the excellent costumes, everything about the production of this film is stellar.To be honest, it's not perfect. The pacing is off, and the film doesn't have that kind of \"breathing beat\" that really, really should have been here, considering what kind of product they were making.Ghostland is very similar in intent to Cabin In The Woods. It's easy for someone to watch it and completely miss ALL the references. To just see it as it superficially appears. And, in my opinion, the filmmakers should have added a few extra \"winks\" to the audience to let them in on the joke.I predict this film will become a cult classic in the coming years.Don't watch it, you wouldn't appreciate it.My vote: 7/10.",

Sofia Boutella gives a great performance as the heart of the film and Bill Moseley is really good, which cancels out some of the weaker and more annoying smaller supporting performances.Sion Sono's direction is fantastic, the film is consistently bold and weird and culminates in a really fun, stylish and gleefully violent final battle.

Its told in partially in flashbacks and who the characters are becomes clear pretty quick.It was okay but I'm certainly not calling it classic. Kind of a surrealist mad max with a few samurais, a few decent scenes of blood and violence but nothing too extreme. Its got nice visuals but its a little slow, and little light on story.When people who just want to see the next Nicolas Cage action flick get a strange, somewhat slow paced arty mashup of genres I don't know, I think there may be some disappointed viewers when this gets a wide release. There is some weird just for weird sake type stuff in the film, like scene where everyone is clapping or snapping in unison when Bill Mosley arrives, it just goes on a little too long. Same with the shot of the gumball machine, those scenes were kind of pointless and should have been edited down.But I didn't hate this. It looks cool. The actress who plays Bernice is lovely.

Nicolas Cage is surprisingly bland for most of it, with maybe one or two exceptions. It didn't feel like there were much stakes to it and I was pretty bored for most of it, which is a shame as the premise is pretty cool, but it didn't deliver much.To give some credit, the set design and aesthetics aren't too bad, as well as the costumes and violence (with little there is). The main villain guy didn't do much for me and I just didn't care at all for the characters. Maybe there were more scenes that were originally there that didn't make the cut? It seemed structurally messy and the weird stuff fell flat for me. This was not worth the journey at all by the end of it.3/10.",

The evil round eyes, Capitalist Pig Americans, take and control the Honest citizens. The real American devil in a fast car that would bust their left nut for immoral values. By the end of the movie I was asking, What the *** did I just watch? What in the *** did I just watch? I can only wonder if this was Frankenstein (Death Race) meets Mad Max meets Kill Bill in A Fist Full of Dollars. There are many scenes that capture the best Mad Max and Karate films over the decades that do not fit in with the rest of the movie. Then there are a number of scenes that fit the Mad Max type movies in the outland. There seems to be one common thread through the whole movie and that is the writer and director was on drugs while making the movie. This is more typical of the 60's drug induced movies than any of the ones mentioned above.This begs the question why did Nicolas Cage make the movie? This too is one of his strangest movies. It keeps switching back and forth from the Nicolas Cage persona we all enjoy and a poorly done psychotic Mad Max. Hollywood has flipped its lid and is putting out some of the worst trash in decades, but for Nicolas Cage to get caught up in this, he had to have owed someone big time for making this garbage.",

It was like a weird mixture of the Walking Dead, Waterworld, Army of the Dead and Army of Darkness... without necessarily having zombies... It does indeed play out like a live action anime. It's not your mainstream action flick. It definitely has an art-film vibe to it. At first, the far-east-far-west mixture was a bit too 'randomly odd,' but it ends up working pretty well in creating this very surreal dream land/limbo setting. If you're not a fan of art house, foreign or other niche film genres, you probably won't like this. I was expecting a pretty typical B Cage movie with this, but was pleasantly surprised. The story is pretty interesting, and the world building is very well done. I think for me the setting was the best part of the film. It somehow doesn't feel quite 'complete', but due to the whole strangeness of it I'm not sure what they could do to round it off a bit more. I would recommend this movie if you like movies on the weirder side, and especially if you like Cage and comic-book like fantasy worlds in general. I'd categorize it more on the fantasy side than scifi, personally. Could have been better, could have definitely been worse. 6/10 overall. 8/10 with some herb.",

But it's a convoluted mess.For those who only speak english i would advise looking for subtitles as there is a lot of non english speaking, you could get the gist but it's a slog cos there is long scenes with no english.If you here just for nic then you can probs skip any scene he isn't in and still get some enjoyment but as a whole this film is utter garbage and no amount of 'justification' or genre bending mumbo jumbo is holding water for me.It's terrible AVOID.",

Hollywood man, never change.Visually (In terms of direction) it was well done, a couple of off moments here and there, but overall decent. ALSO, a huge shout out to the prop master and set designer because some of those visuals were just super interesting to me... Just a shame they weren't in a better written film.I stopped at the 50-minute mark, just couldn't take it anymore, any movie I can't finish is an instant 1 unfortunately.

They could have amped it up a bit more, and except for two scenes (a ball explosion and a neck slice) it didn't have nearly enough gore for me.In summary - I really liked this movie, the cast, acting, writing wasn't too bad, direction etc; but it lost 1 point for not enough gore, 1 point for the cheap sets and unconvincing crowds, and 1 point for a lack of crazy.If you're a fan of Nic's other recent work, I'm sure you'll enjoy this, you might just need a couple of drinks to help you ignore the imperfections.",

This movie was pointless and never really made sense. Nicolas Cage has done several strange lackluster movies in recent years which is extremely disappointing because I think he's talented. Prisoners Of The Ghostland was nothing but lazy terrible writing and flat ridiculous boring characters. The acting was awful as well. Maybe that was supposed to add to the comedic aspect of the film? To me, it was just annoying. This is not a movie I would typically ever watch but my aunt rented it from Redbox and my grandparents wanted to give it a chance. I was ready to turn it off within the first 10 minutes but ended up watching the whole thing with them. It never got any better. I was glad when it was over. Adding this to the list of worst movies I've ever seen. It's listed as \"action\" , \"syfy\" , and \"thriller\". There's some action but it's definitely not a thriller. The only syfy aspect was the ridiculous unexplained costumes and zombie like creatures. Overall, this movie had no substance. I would call it terrible storytelling, but there's really no story to be told. Idiotic concept and equally poor execution.",

Can't remember the last time, I have witnessed such absurd yet ruminative execution. From testicles bursting to slitted throats, from people in weird dresses doing some weird stuff to sudden sightings of supernatural beings; trust me, you will be getting the full course of lunacy in there.However, at the same time, what you also get is a tangible story that allegorically speaks of Redemption, Retribution and Liberty. With the help of some stunning set designs and an outstanding Score; Prisoners of the Ghostland achieves a whole new tier of cinema. A world that is comprised of the dystopian rendition of our civilization as well as a ton of real-life elements derived directly from the community we currently inhabit.Now, coming to Performances, Nicholas Cage steals the limelight, once again. People may poke fun at him, make jokes about his script selections, but no one in their right mind would deny his dedication and talent. A film like Pig is nothing but a testimony to my argument! Barring Cage, Sofia Boutella as Bernice and Bill Moseley as the Governor are two other important additions as well. If only the character of Yasujiro had a nicer portrayal. Real shame!So to summarise, if you ask me, I had a good enough time, I was able to acknowledge the irregularities; even though I do realize that's not gonna be the case for everyone. It will depend upon your openness to creativity and the very craft of experimental filmmaking. If you are ever in a mood for some offbeat, quirky action; make sure to tune in. I assure you, it would be worth your while.",

            "review_title": "Visually Stunning, Wild, but Flawed Movie",
            "content": "This was a movie that I planned on seeing at the theater, but I couldn't make the times work. When I saw that it came to Shudder, I then decided to watch it there. I did hear some mixed reviews on it, so I was curious how this would be. It worked out as an interesting double feature on Journey with a Cinephile: A Horror Movie Podcast. The synopsis is a notorious criminal must break an evil curse in order to rescue an abducted girl who has mysteriously disappeared.For this movie, most of it is taking place in Samurai Town. There is also another name for it, but I didn't write it down. It is run by the Governor (Bill Moseley). We get to see a scene of Hero (Nicolas Cage) along with his partner Psycho (Nick Cassavetes) as they rob a bank. There is this child that is offering gumballs and Psycho aims his gun at this boy. Hero does what he can to prevent this.Coupling with this we have Bernice (Sofia Boutella) trying to flee the town. She is being aided by geishas and her friend Susie (Yuzuka Nakaya). In order to get out, they need to ensure that the guards are taken care of. They don't seem to get far though as something happens to them.That is when the Governor calls Hero before him. He is fitted into a leather suit that has bombs attached to the arms, neck and genitals. These bombs will go off he tries to strike a woman, if he gets fresh with one or he tries to remove the suit. He has five days to get Bernice and bring her back to the Governor, or he will die.This begins the journey into what is dubbed the ghostland. We see monstrous man that was killed. It appears he was a notorious criminal and now he is holding everyone prisoner there. He has an army of mindless soldiers and even what looks to be samurais. Hero will do whatever he can to save Bernice and break this curse before it is too late. The real question though, who is the real villain here?Where I want to start then for me actually breaking down the movie is that I did see part of the trailer for this when Jaime and I went to the Gateway Film Center. This movie is visually stunning and I knew that from what I saw. It is quite interesting as well as there is a lot of allegory and referencing that we are also getting here. The imaginary is well done by director Sion Sono as well. I was braced coming in that this was going to wild and it doesn't disappoint there. Not necessarily in the way that I was expecting though.The first thing that I should get into is that this movie is paying homage to westerns and the basis for those movies, the samurai tale. We are combining them in an interesting way. I'm not overly versed in westerns and I have not seen much in the way of the samurai films either. I do know that westerns adopted the nameless hero from this sub-genre and from Japan. It is a direct reference here that Cage's character is named Hero. Much like you'd get in westerns, he's a flawed character and this is a redemption tale for him. We are also getting a lot of traditional ideas mixed with more modern ones. The Governor is white. He is ruling this town as a capitalist. I can see that in westerns since the richest guy usually did run things. Yasujiro (Tak Sakaguchi) is a samurai forced to be his bodyguard due to Susie or at least that is what she believes. Plus we have Sheriff Takato (Takato Yonemoto) and Deputy Shin (Shin Shimizu) who provide the Governor almost an army of cowboys. The other things that struck me here were the amount of geishas while it still feeling like a western town. It is an interesting blend with the style of architecture of Japan. I found this to be visually interesting.There is also some intriguing social commentary here. I've already alluded to this movie speaking out about capitalism. Hero and Psycho are poor so they rob a bank. The Governor is controlling this town with money. He is a villain from the beginning. I like that this movie is trying to blur the lines of good and bad. Hero killed people, but he does what is right. The Governor and Psycho are worse. We are never getting that they're good, but I would say that the Governor does come off neutral in the start. The movie is able to be subtle with this to the point where you can ignore it if you'd like.The other commentary is the idea of nuclear power. It would appear this movie is speaking out against it along with the use of weapons. There was a power plant that melted down and how the waste was being stored caused problems. This again goes back to capitalism as well. I'm assuming this is in part to what happened to the nuclear plant quite a few years ago that melted down as well as the bombings from World War II. The demon that is holding everyone prisoner in the ghostland was affected by the toxic waste causing him to become what he has. This has vibes of The Toxic Avenger with this idea as well.I believe with that I've broken down the story enough. Where I should go would be how this is all conveyed. We have some beautiful shots here so I'll give credit to Sono along with the director of photography, S\u00f4hei Tanikawa. Together they are able to convey some things with showing us. There is a dream like feel to this and almost like a surreal take as well. There are many times I wasn't sure what was real and what wasn't. Going along with this would be the effects. We don't get a lot here which surprised me. What we do looked to be practical for the most part from what I can remember. The blood we do get looked good. This movie does get wild as it gets to its climax for sure. Aside from that, I'd say the soundtrack fit for what was needed. We get the atmosphere of being in a Japanese town while also mixing in some tracks that worked for the scenes.Then the last thing will be the acting. Nicolas Cage is an interesting actor to me. I think he is good, but he needs the right director. I think that for the most part Sono was able to rein him in. He does over act a bit out there that didn't work for me. Boutella is an actress I'm not overly impressed with. I thought she was okay here. Cassavetes was good as Psycho. He fit that role. I love how over the top Moseley plays his role. He seems like a villain from the beginning. Sakaguchi was solid along with Young Dais and Nakaya. I think the supporting cast was good for what was needed.In conclusion here, I was a bit let down by this movie if I'm going to be honest. I tried to temper my expectations, but it is hard when most things I've seen from Sono I have liked. That's not to say I hated this, because that's not the case. I enjoyed the references to westerns and samurai films, even though I'm not as versed in them as I should be. I thought that Cage over acted and I'm not high on Boutella, but the rest of the cast worked for me. The cinematography for this movie is amazing. I thought that the soundtrack fit for what was needed as well. The commentary under what we are seeing also worked for me. I'd say that this is still an above average movie despite my issues.",

            "content": "Nicolas Cage has had an interesting career. Academy Award winner, Golden Globe award winner, box office draw. Then a divorce and tax issues took their toll financially. A few films that didn't do the same box office business previous films resulted in him taking on nearly any project that came his way. Among those were some of the best performances of his career (JOE and MANDY among them). But like a number of actors who were strong in the late 80s through 90s the studios were tossing him less stellar roles. Which is sad.PRIOSNERS OF THE GHOSTLAND is not likely to raise Cage's profile. While a solid film it's a bit too strange for most viewers. Cage does a great job here but that's not enough to save the film from the oddness that is on screen.The film takes place in a future Japan ravaged by nuclear waste. Cage plays Hero, a big time bank robber who hits a bank with partner Psycho (Nick Cassavetes). In the course of the robbery a number of people are killed including a small child. Hero is captured and tossed into the dankest cell they can find in a place called Samurai Town.One day Hero is removed from his cell and brought out to meet the Governor (Bill Mosely), the ruler of Samurai Town. Given a new leather suit to wear he puts it on willingly and is then told why he's been summoned. One of the Governor's \"granddaughters\" has left the town and entered the Ghostland. In return for rescuing his \"granddaughter\" the Governor agrees to let Hero free.To insure that he doesn't run off, the new outfit he is wearing comes with preventive measures. Explosive devices are embedded in the outfit, two near his private parts, one on each are and two on his neck. Should he get excited and attempt to molest the girl the lower bombs explode. If he attempts to strike her the ones in his arms. And if he should fail to return her in 3 days all of them explode at once.Hero sets out to his task only to wreck the car he was in when faced with a mirage. Or was it? In any event he is rescued by the Ratman, a strange person who comes from deep inside Ghostland. He takes him to the main city, if you can call it that, and there Hero learns that no one escapes from Ghostland. He sees an odd assortment of people there from clock worshipping cult to scavengers of the land.Hero gets a lead on Bernice (Sofia Boutella), the \"granddaughter\" he was searching for. He rescues her and tries to leave only to be stopped. In a world where the strange is normal, where ghosts might be real and where the followers of a clock cult may hold the answer, Hero must find a way to escape Ghostland or face his own death.What sounds like a pretty straightforward film is far from it. The story her feels like a mashup of so many films we've already seen, in particular the MAD MAX movies. Toss in a western or two as well as some surreal Japanese fantasy films and you get the picture. The problem is that we jump back and forth from one to the other and zig zag back and forth in time and space so much that it's easy to get lost. Add to that the film is half in Japanese requiring subtitles and it makes it that much more difficult.Visually the movie is stunning, the Ghostland the least so as it feels like any other post-apocalyptic world we've seen countless times over. Dirt everywhere, mechanical backdrops and more. The sequences in Samurai Town are exquisite though with bright colors and fabrics as well as some eerie walls of faces that work well. The cinematography of the entire film is crisp and clean and well thought out. The best parts of this film are these.Cage does a fine job here given what he has but it is Bill Mosely who stands out among the actors. A slight touch of southern gentleman, prognosticating politician, slick con man and lecherous old man all come together in the character of the Governor and that's in no small part to his performance. Mosely has always been relegated to smaller roles or lead parts in some of the goriest films made. This shows he has deserved better.On the whole this movie looks spectacular but as far as an entertaining film to watch repeatedly it falls far short of that goal. Still, if you can't find anything better this week you might want to give it a watch.",

Personally, I'm all for it. However, from the looks of it, this particular blend of art house sensibilities and B-movie aesthetics seems to be rubbing people the wrong way.The core premise is a simplistic hero/villain/damsel in distress narrative that strings you along, but isn't winning any points for complexity. What sets the film apart is it's gonzo delivery. Jumping genres from Western, to Samurai, to post apocalyptic, approaching everything with a surrealism that favours the absurd over traditional logic. Action fans will inevitably complain that \"nothing makes sense\" and the art crowd will probably deem the violent fight sequences too low-brow. But if you find yourself somewhere in between, there's much to admire. The set design is glorious, juxtaposing Mad Max-esque junkyard future aesthetics with a lavish geisha brothel. The soundtrack is suitably epic, mixing Morricone and 80s synth. The patented Cage Rage may be somewhat underused, but it did provide him an excellent opportunity to yell \"TESTICLE!\" which will undoubtedly end up in the next freak out compilation.",

He doesn't deserve the extreme 1 star hit jobs.This film reminds me of the 'tongue in cheek' Cage. 'Tough guy but laughs at the situation around him' Cage. The sets are purposely designed to be kitschy like a horror comic. The references to Mad Max (Thunderdome not Road Warrior) is also on purpose.It's one of my favorite kinds of film.

            "content": "Honestly i wasn't expecting that much from this movie. The premise made it sound a bit like some Escape from New York/LA and with Nic Cage starring, could had been fun. I know his track record of Direct to Video ain't stellar, but the dude can be charismatic and funny at times even if the movie is subpar.Sadly this movie is not only the worst movie i saw in 2022 so far, but also the worst movie i watched from Nic Cage. A Score to Settle had a good premise, but end up being a boring drag fest, yet at least the story made some sense. It bored me, but not made me roll my eyes thinking \"wtf am i watching\".The problem with Prisonners of the Ghostland is not the direction, music, or even the acting (wich without being amazing, is not bad either). Its the story. It makes no sense !This is basically a simple premise you seen many times, in the afformentioned \"Escape from\" with Kurt Russel, only here, maybe it was a matter of budget, or filming location rights, but basically this is like a 20-25 minute short that they drag for an hour and 40 minutes. There is pretty much 2 locations in the whole movie.Scenes drag and drag with a bunch of nonsense, weird characters, some \"japanese stuff\" that just make you wonder what it is supose to be, only feeling like padding. Maybe if i was high on LSD i would had fun with the nonsense, but even tipsy on beer i did not one bit. So if you watch Jeremy Jahn, this is NOT a \"good time if you're drunk. Not even a \"won't remember it in T-minus 1 day\". But clearly his worst rating...I am somebody who is easily please with movies. I can apreciate a dumb movie, even more when im on beer. I had so much fun with Prince of the Sun with Cynthia Rothrock, this movie was so dumb but funny dumb. I watch Batman and Robin from time to time and just laugh with it.Sometimes i just watch direct to video cheap action movies cause among them there is some hidden gems. Often i finish them and i just think \"meh...guess it passed time\". What i mean is they not amazing, won't ever watch them again, but they were alright to watch once most of the time. Even the worst ones, i would usually give them a 4. They are clearly subpar, often boring, but rarely completely atrocious.Prisonners of the Ghost Land only had me look at the remaining time about a dozen if not more times, i kept rolling my eyes thinking \"wtf am i watching\". This movie make Jiu Jitsu (another Nic Cage DTV) looks like a Masterpiece. At least there is some action and the story make some sense.I think this may be the first 2 stars i ever give, don't quote me on it, but even some of the worst movies there is, i usually give them 3 or 4, as i can apreciate a tiny bits of them. Here i give 2 stars because the VERY few sword action scenes there was were decent. I mean they were nicely filmed and competent overall. But there is so few of them and they matter so few in the story, not making you engage at all, that i can't give them more than 2 stars.Even with what i said above, that the direction, music, acting, camera work etc, was all fine, you would think it would deserve more than 2. But NO, the issue is the story being so bad and dragging and dragging, making you go between \"what is going on\" and \"im sooo bore, does it end soon\" , i can't give it the same rating i would give a generic boring action direct to video.Alright, i know im dragging this review , but if you think THIS is dragging, oh boy do not watch this movie :PAll i wanted was a cool action movie with Nic Cage having to go into \"Mad Max territories\" to rescue someone important. :/",

            "content": "While not truly knowing what to expect, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enter this film with certain expectations. I've seen several of filmmaker Sion Sono's movies and enjoyed them (I especially loved 'Love exposure' and 'Why don't you play in hell?'). This comes in the midst of a strong period in recent years in Nicolas Cage's career, including 'Mandy,' 'Colour out of space,' 'Willy's Wonderland,' and 'Pig.' And while I'm less familiar with Sofia Boutella, any time I have seen her I've been impressed (Gaspar No\u00e9's 'Climax,' 2017 action-thriller 'Atomic blonde'). While not all equal, Sono's pictures commonly claim wild, unorthodox flavors of over the top, playful embellishment, so with Cage on board as such, who better to tackle a tale smashing together the western genre, Japanese culture, facets of horror, and traces of John Carpenter's 'Escape from New York?'As quickly as 'Prisoners of the Ghostland' begins what comes across is that, perhaps encouraged by the opportunity to make his first picture in English, Sono seized the chance to be as absolutely Extra as he possibly could be. Everything here seems cranked up to 11 and self-indulgent - the production design and art direction, stunts and effects, scene writing and direction, characters, narrative, plot development. Even at that, in many ways this still feels like it fits neatly within the filmmaker's oeuvre; if the feature were a wholly Japanese production, I don't think anyone would have batted an eye at all the overcooked abstruseness - a lot of people wouldn't get it, but 'Prisoners' would be passed off as Sono being Sono, and left at that. With the greater visibility that came with the casting and nature of this production, however, scrutiny has been heightened, as though folks suddenly feel license to be critical in ways they wouldn't otherwise.Mind you, this is definitely not to say that this feature is or should be free from critical eyes. In an off-kilter way I'm reminded of Sono's directorial debut, 2001's 'Suicide Club': for much of its length it built a strong, cohesive narrative that was distinctly building toward something, but it reached a point where the writing took a left turn or two (or three) and coherence fell away a bit. While 'Prisoners' can claim a complete and obliquely compelling story, Aaron Hendry and Reza Sixo Safai's screenplay, and Sono's realization of it, comes across as that same bizarre narrative turn, writ large and sustained over the entirety of these 100 minutes. I admire the unswerving daring to create a feature of such extreme, disjointed, complicated, and muddied storytelling, embracing every weird impulse and flourish. I would have admired the film itself far more if the excess and jazzed up frills were reined in even just a tad. As it is, this is kind of all over the place, and seems like it's barely holding itself together.I can honestly say that I do like 'Prisoners of the Ghostland.' I think it's made very well in all ways, such as it is, and though the cast is guided into chewing scenery - well, that fits the slant of the production, doesn't it? This is outrageous and totally overdone across the board, but only by intention. I just wish the slightest measure of self-restraint had been employed at any point, because in writing and in execution the movie takes the longest, strangest, most winding, least direct road to telling its story. This simply didn't need to be as much as it is. I don't even know who I would recommend this to except for folks who already know and are enamored with Sono's style, or similarly odd fare, and even then it will be hard-pressed to find appeal with all. I commend everyone involved for the work they put into it, and I believe 'Prisoners of the Ghostland' turned out better than not, but I also can't begrudge anyone for disliking a title that goes out of its way to be fancifully and outlandish.",

It is filled with continuity issues, or at best questions, loads of heavy handed symbolism missing the mark, and the thinest attempt at a plot I've seen in quite some time. The movie has subtitles for the Japanese lines, but none for a number of characters who speak in just mumble-groans, which is by design, but makes you question why even bother as it adds absolutely nothing.Partly produced by the same crew as Mandy and Color Out of Space. You get some of the weird with this one, but absolutely none of the enjoyment.You can start this movie at any random spot, watch for 15 minutes, and probably get the same out of it as having watched it in full.

            "content": "This movie is, to put it mildly, an experience. If you go in expecting things like fleshed out characters, a cohesive narrative, or even a three-act structure, you will be left frustrated and irritated. Instead of anything resembling a movie, Prisoners of the Ghostland is more of a collection of scenes and moments without any kind of logic or traditional plot applied.There is a concept of a story: Hero, a bank robber, is tasked with rescuing the Governor of Samurai Town's \"Granddaughter\" from the Ghostland, a cursed place, blasted and scarred by nuclear radiation. Hero is outfitted in a leather suit with explosives that will detonate if he, in any way, goes against his orders. With Hero setting off in a child's bicycle, the adventure begins.As others have said, the plotting and pace are bizarre. Nic Cage spends a good chunk of the first half unconscious, having repeated flashbacks to the failed robbery that led to his imprisonment, and his guilt manifesting in visions of a child who was killed on that fateful day. These flashbacks recur through the entire movie, even well into the climax. Granted, the sight of brightly-colored gumballs flying through the air in slow motion is beautiful, but after the sixth or seventh time can become a bit much.Similar to Cage's previous genre entry Mandy, almost all of the action and chaos is backloaded onto the second half of the story. This is where (in my opinion at least) the movie redeems itself. As a huge fan of Tak Sakaguchi, seeing him face off against Cage is worth the price of admission alone. Even though Sakaguchi does most of the heavy lifting on the action side of things - especially when facing off against a dozen enemy samurai - Cage does a decent job holding his own, especially at his age. As carnage unfolds in all directions, Sion Sono's style comes to the forefront, with gorgeous imagery and bonkers over-the-top violence that the director has become known for.In short, I really, really liked this one. I even pre-ordered the blu ray the moment I left the theater. However, every negative thing you've been told about Prisoners of the Ghostland is accurate. Whether it was due to time or budgetary constraints, it barely feels like a finished movie. There is no flow to the story, characters come and go from the story without reason, and the movie can't even respect its own internal logic.With that said, your enjoyment of this will be directly proportional to how much/little you care about conventional filmmaking, and whether or not you can enjoy an unfinished mess that features nonstop sakura blossoms falling while Nic Cage screams \"TESTICLLLLLLE\" to a crowd of confused onlookers. In other words: The critics and other reviewers are all correct: This is bad. Really bad. Unbearably and oppressively bad.But it's MY kind of bad.",

Cage does what he does best - work right on the edge of diving deep into over-acting hack territory and pulls out a performance only he can do - sincerely unhinged, often saying more by just reacting silently than pages of dialogue could do.I like many big, mainstream films. I like heartfelt dramas, some to the point of schmaltz. Comedies. Documentaries. But I'm always looking for something totally off the rails.

It started off with a silly scenario, and continued with dumb actions that Nicholas made to either be ironic or funny. The only creepy scenes were apparently in the trailer, and they weren't that creepy in the movie. I didn't understand what was going on most of the time. I didn't watch to the end, so maybe everything got straightened out. That's the only reason I gave this 4 stars. I'm not sure I will try it again. Very disappointed.",

It's just like Escape from New York except here it's Japan. Nic Cage goes into the wasteland to rescue a girl and fights samurai and meets all kinda weird while wearing a suit rigged with explosives that detonate if he doesn't meet deadlines. The movie has a decent budget, nice set pieces, okay fight sequences and you can't go wrong with Nic Cage and Sofia Boutella. But overall it falls flat because of lousy directing.

The best couple of sets of this year.Excellent editing. Colorful almost theatrical performances and some snippets of the man's genius.Not sure Nicholas cage was needed. He does do his usual performance. But you know you are looking at Cage.And that perhaps detracts from the sets and camerawork which is again excellent.Bundled with some of the best editing skills you get a movie with a pretty weak story but told in such a way that the time moves fast.BUT THE MEDIUM MOVIE , WHAT CAN IT OFFER.?The story should be the star and the rest should be a means. So I can't give it more than a 5.Sometimes during watching it I thought Sion Sono was giving Hollywoos the big middle finger. But now a couple of days have passed and I Realize he was trying to make the most of it. In the past he would have just shot it. Take the pay heck and work on his own projects.ANYWAY. To the credit of the producers it does seem that Sono had enough freedom to put his stamp on the movie. And instead of joining the list of movies I have to rate a 1. It passes with a 5. And that is really surprising.Do yourself a favor and watch his other movies. The ones he has written himself.",

And, I think, it would be perfectly reasonable for someone to expect that, especially with Nicolas Cage and Sofia Boutella in it.Trust me. It that's what you are looking for, Prisoners of Ghostland will be a disappointment. I think that is reflective of many of the low rated reviews here.Plot wise, essentially, it is a kind of \"Escape from New York\" set in a dystopian future resembling a mash up of Japan and the Old West. Nicolas Cage plays, \"Hero,\" a bank robber allowed at a chance of freedom if he finds a man's granddaughter. The man is called the Governor and runs a bizarre future town that has saloons and bordellos with gunslingers, geishas, and samurai. The Governor is played by Bill Moseley, doing every bit his best to channel his inner Dennis Hopper.So, Hero is imprisoned after a bank robbery gone horribly wrong, and to regain his freedom he must find the Governor's granddaughter as I mentioned.This dystopian future appears to be Japan, but there is no rhyme nor reason that I could detect why there is a Western styled town with gunslinging cowboys in it. There are a lot of fun set pieces and colorful geishas that might wear some people thin, but I found entertaining. As, Hero heads out into the wasteland, we later learn there was a nuclear disaster that created the dystopia. He goes on a few adventures before finding the granddaughter, played by Sofia Boutella. Each adventure is a little stranger then the last and is reminiscent of the film Road Warrior. If you try to follow the film as a straight narrative, you'll most likely get bored and/or irritated. But, if you watch it, with a sense of fun and let go and some of the more surreal elements, it can be just that. Fun.Since the film's strength relies on its visual elements, it's a little hard to describe each scene and I don't want to spoil anything. Safe to say, Hero, does make it back to see the Governor and that's where the Prisoners of Ghostland has its explosive climax.The film's director Sion Sono also directed the films, Why don't You Play in Hell? And Suicide Club. More accessible, in my opinion, but also on the strange side. I didn't realize, at first, that he was the director.This film aside, I must admit, I'm really enjoying seeing the journey Nicolas Cage is taking as an actor. Definitely hit or miss, but it's fun to see what he'll be in next.",

After writing the review I learned that the movie was originally supposed to be shot in Mexico as a spaghetti Western with an English-speaking cast, but they changed it to a movie with samurais and Japanese actors because of Sion Sono's health problems. That explains so much of why it doesn't really work and always seems a little off.",

All around his small town is what they call the Ghostland, a place where the radiated scum of the Earth live and die and kill. When Bernice (Sofia Boutella, Gazelle from Kingsmen: The Secret Service and Jaylah from Star Trek Beyond), one of the granddaughters, goes missing The Governor makes it Hero's (Nicholas Cage, again the California Kinski of weird roles in stranger movies) job to rescue her.\n\n\n\nThrough movie fate, Hero's old partner was Psycho (Nick Cassavetes), a man who will fill anyone in his way and was the cause of the accident which destroyed most of Japan. And then one of his balls explodes.\n\nYes, Prisoners of the Ghostland isn't your normal movie. It's directed by Sion Sono, who also made Suicide Club, Tokyo Tribe, Why Don't You Play In Hell?, Tag and so many more wild movies over the past few years.\n\nSono has called Wild at Heart his favorite Nicolas Cage movie and one of his inspirations while saying that Cage was \"The easiest person I ever worked with, brought me back from the dead.\"  That's because the film was delayed a year after the director had a heart attack.\n\nAs for Cage, he's referred to this as the wildest movie he's ever made. My jury is out on that one, but this movie looks, feels and acts as odd as its star and trust me, I wouldn't have it any other way.

The costumes are excellent. The town is excellent. The premise for the film is excellent. There just isn't enough logical narrative to hold it all together. It kind of looked like a Steampunk Convention where everybody was drunk. \nBut Nicholas Cage still did a fine job. He's a great actor, but there just isn't much here for him to work with.

            "content": "All questions.  I'll give this my best shot: this is about a hardened criminal (Nicolas Cage) in Japan.  He has been captured and presented with a deal for his freedom from the Governor (Bill Moseley): put on a bodysuit with explosive devices a la The Suicide Squad and bring back the Governor's granddaughter (Sofia Boutella).  This will be a challenge because she has gone to the Ghostland, which is a place that nobody can leave once they enter.  So this is one that made me excited.  The trailers looked to be over-the-top, and they even put on a quote from Cage on the poster: \"The wildest movie I've ever made.\"  Armed with excitement, I bought my ticket with friends.  Boy was I disappointed.  I want to say that I made an earnest effort with this, and I was on board for the setup.  Bill Moseley is doing his best Colonel Sanders impression, and he lays down all the rules, firmly establishing the running clock involved and the dire consequences if not met.  Even though I couldn't tell what to make of where this movie was headed, I was here for the premise and the tone.  Then the story proceeds to aimlessly drift for the next hour.  I thought we were about to get into a time-sensitive action thriller that would keep the tension taut, and I don't understand why they emphasize the countdown if they never planned to follow through with it.  Once we get to the Ghostland, it just stops making sense.  It is weird for the sake of being weird, and you can only show me so much random imagery before I start to grow numb to it.  I don't know if this is a positive or a negative, but they don't explain how any of this works.  Sure, they'll take a break in the middle to give you a literal slide show on what happened in the past, but they never establish any rules to this world, so there are no stakes.  No stakes mean no reason to care, and I don't blame the entire row in front of me in the theater for bailing at the hour mark.  I just wanted a crazy Nicolas Cage action movie, but any action is few and far between.  In fact, I would even go to say that Cage is underutilized in this movie.  This random samurai (Tak Sakaguchi) is given more to work with than Cage, and it's not a lot.  I was thankful that Cage was there since he is doing his standard wide-eyed performance, which was enough to keep me awake.  The writing and the pacing make Prisoners of the Ghostland D.O.A.",

I got annoyed with the number of production companies displayed in the opening credits, you'd think at least one would've invested in a seasoned writer to at least look over the final script. Safi and Hendry wrote a bunch of incoherent, convoluted, plot-hole and technical-issue riddled nonsense.\n\nThe 103 min runtime, sub-par pacing, and many long dragged out and unnecessary scenes, made this film seem like it was 3+ hours long.\n\nLuckily, with Sono's directing and Sohei Tanikawa's near-perfect cinematography, the eye-candy sets, crazy costumes and props, and stunning visuals kept me hooked. The score was fitting and on point. The casting and performances were excellent, especially Nicolas Cage (who this role was made for) and Sofia Boutella.\n\nIt's a shame no one babysat the writers, as this could've easily been a cult classic. But as is, I'm thinking this would've been a much better music video backdrop for Pink Floyd or Metallica album. It's a very generous 6/10 from me.",

Possessing technical attributes of making the biggest Hollywood studios shamelessly hide with envy, Sion Sono's movie is as illogical, absurd, ridiculous, stupid, and insanely entertaining as I hoped it would be. By mixing up dozens of distinct genres, the straightforward premise gets sucked into a world of total anarchy, where samurais, cowboys, nuclear explosions, modern cars, and much more collide to surround an otherwise simple narrative with nonsensically hilarious storylines and awesome action sequences. Sofia Boutella and Bill Moseley help Cage tackle this chaos, but the latter is the absolute standout due to his remarkable experience in crazy films. Despite it occasionally crossing the line and becoming too much for me to manage - it becomes seriously confusing - as long as the viewers are well-prepared to accept every jaw-dropping new development, fun is guaranteed with this brilliant satire.\"",
