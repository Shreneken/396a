            "content": "When ever there is a war, natural calamity or a terrorist attack, the first people to come out and protect is Indian Army, who selflessly support us with their act of bravery. With never-ending tension going between India and Pakistan, so many sacrifices are being made by our Indian soldiers whose duty is to save the citizen from the scum of the Earth. To honor the soldiers who have laid down their lives to serve the country, there are few movies being made to tell the stories of gallantry. One such movie is on the Vikram Batra biopic drama, Shershaah, which stars Sidharth Malhotra and Kiara Advani.Shershaah chronicles the life and story of the brave soldiers Vikram Batra (played by Sidharth Malhotra) who led a very difficult operation in Kargil War against Pakistan and even managed to pull down the enemy soldiers in hand combat, ensuring a solid victory for our motherland.Directed by Vishnu Vardhan, Shershaah is one such film which will keep you engaged right from the beginning till the electrifying climax. The powerful true story of Vikram Batra along with other soldiers who have sacrificed and struggled to ensure that safety of Indian citizen is their top most priority, The makers have done a fabulous job in portraying the stress, blood and sweat displayed by our honorable soldiers. Couple of scenes did caught my attention - Pakistani missiles hitting the Indian base in a surprise attack, the action scene at the police check point and last but not the least, the final showdown - which is the climax scene showing the ultimate sacrifice by Vikram Batra when he exposes himself to the enemy fire trying to drag the injured soldier to safety, and in the process was shot. We get to see the real heroes only through some newspaper articles or social media who fought for their country, sacrificed their family and could not even return back to their motherland. Thanks to films like Shershaah speaks the true events of making of a soldier and the hardship and struggle these war machines go through.The initial reels had romantic track showing how Vikram Batra meets his fiancee Dimple hampers the momentum of the biopic drama, though the chemistry between Sidharth Malhotra and Kiara Advani is sparkling. Also, it is high time, Bollywood can start making biopics without songs and melodrama which sometimes play the spoilsports. Nevertheless, writing by Sandeep Shrivastava is brilliant which should be lauded. Technically, Shershaah boast off brilliant cinematography capturing the beautiful locales of Kashmir and Ladakh. Art direction is mind-blowing while background score creates more tensionTalking about performance, Sidharth Malhotra essays the role of Vikram Batra with T. The actor successfully shows diverse expressions of Vikram Batra right from the beginning when he joins the Indian Army as a rookie to the gallant soldier who fights for his country till his last breath. Shershaah might be a turning point in Sidharth Malhotra's career who comes up with a brave performance. In the supporting role, Kiara Advani, Shiv Pandit and Nikitin Dheer have acted their part with equal justice.So overall, Shershaah is a spellbinding tale of a brave soldier which should be lauded and appreciated for its genuine attempt. Very good 3.5/5.",

            "review_title": "An Inspiring War Drama Of Braveheart's And Victories !!!",
            "content": "The Kargil War, 1999 - the toughest mountain warfare ever. Fought at a dizzying altitude of 17,000 feet, this historic war had a lot at stake. The Pakistani troops had infiltrated into the Indian side of the Line of Control (LoC), disguised as Kashmiri militants. The skirmishes quickly escalated into a full-blown war that also chalked the journey of a soldier from Lieutenant to Captain for his absolute dare-devilry and patriotic spirit to unfurl the tricolour at the highest point of conflict. Even if that meant laying down his own life for the cause.But before we get there, director Vishnu Varadhan and his writer Sandeep Srivastava take it slow. So we are taken right back to a childhood sequence of Captain Vikram Batra (Sidharth Malhotra) and shown his growing up years, finding the love of his life Dimple Cheema (Kiara Advani), before he is finally posted at the 13 JAK Rifles as a Lieutenant. While this build-up depicts the character's journey, it doesn't do so very sharply to merit so much screentime. In fact, most of the times, Kiara Advani's track and the romantic songs featuring her, feel like a distraction from the heavy-duty subject at hand. This also impacts the pace of the film that suffers from a slow first half.Of course, director Vishnu Varadhan had a mammoth task of doing justice to the copious amounts of data and milestones from the Kargil war, but the bulk of it is dealt with, in the second half. Sidharth Malhotra shines in the war scenes and his performance evolves through the film. His earnest efforts to recreate the aura of his character's larger-than-life persona shows on screen and this is one of his better performances. Kiara Advani looks her part as a resolute Sardarni, who loves her man with all her heart. But she doesn't have much scope to perform.Shiv Panditt is very aptly cast as Captain Sanjeev Jamwal, who is tough on the outside, but emotional from within. Nikitin Dheer is impressive as the cheerful Major Ajay Singh Jasrotia and so is Shataf Figar as the straight talking Col. Yogesh Kumar Joshi. Together, these men make for an able team that you will root for, at all times. Among the many other character actors, there are a few stereotypes and clich\u00e9s too, especially on the Pakistani side.The film's overall tone is obviously high on patriotism. Many combat scenes don't reflect the large canvas that the film is set up on, perhaps more deserving of a big screen experience. Yet, as an industry, Bollywood has seldom churned out epic war films that have been critically and commercially acclaimed. By those standards, 'Shershaah' ranks high than most of the recent war dramas and tells an inspiring story that needs to be told.The source material of this film is so strong that it is bound to grip you once the men in uniform take it upon themselves to drive out the enemy and reclaim our land. 'Shershaah's biggest victory is its effort to recreate one of the most important chapters of our recent history with characters, who lead the way to a rousing climax.",

            "content": "Shershaah (2021) :\nMovie Review -War Drama is one of the biggest genre in World cinema since last 100 years or maybe more. Hollywood celebrated this genre like no one else with World War 1 and & World War 2 subjects whereas foreign language cinema focused more on the realistic effects and horrors of the same. In Bollywood, 'Haqeeqat' set a benchmark which hasn't been crossed yet by any other film and for the commercial and massy elements 'Border' became a landmark. Even Border had that unrealistic jingoism but for 90s audience it was overwhelming stuff and the film still enjoys a cult following in TV audience. Recently, the biggest thing came in this genre was 'Uri : The Surgical Strike' which wasn't a great film at all but the timing was so accurate that people just went for it without thinking about anything. Those actual events happened around its release left people with anger and the outburst was already captured by the film hence the box office numbers surpassed all expectations. Shershaah is as good as Uri, so yes it also repeated the same mistakes but again, the same commercialized outlook has saved the film. A shocking thing about Shershaah is, it's extremely emotional film in those last 10 minutes which leaves everyone with teary eyes.Tracing the life journey of Param Vir Chakra awardee and army captain Vikram Batra, it stars Sidharth Malhotra in a double role, as Batra and his identical twin brother Vishal, while Kiara Advani plays the role of Vikram's girlfriend Dimple Cheema. The film does not have any defaming material as we have seen in few films recently and that's why the clean image of army and soldiers fills your chest with pride. Having a burden of relating to biographical genre, the film struggles to establish few important things and in between the love story and the songs do irritate a little bit. Thankfully, that's not too irritating so one can easily pass those moments to enjoy some great moments later.Performance of Sidharth Malhotra is the best we have seen so far. Actually, this is his only 2nd or 3rd acting oriented role while other times he was busy playing a cool, funky guy and here he gets that potential role to showcase different side of his talent. Kiara Advani is more of a powdered doll and if you exclude songs then Shershaah is like a cameo role for her. The Army gang is decent, nothing great which includes Nikitin Dheer, Shiv Pandit and Himmanshoo Malhotra in major roles. Music is fine despite having a misjudged timing in the screenplay. Editing and VFX are okay, though, more accuracy would have been better. Shershaah never bores you because it's a pacy film, the credit should go to the well written screenplay.War Genre is an open genre, it does not limit you with anything so it can be used for anything you want. Hollywood used it for patriotic films, for musicals, for biographicals, for controversial films, for hard-hitting dramas and for sensational theories. Even recently Hollywood made Masterpiece films like 'The Hacksaw Ridge' and '1917'. Well, Bollywood is far behind. When Hollywood made a film like 'Patton', Bollywood was not even making mainstream war films and what a freaking amazing classic Patton was and is even today. That high-quality filmmaking is missing now days and for bollywood it's like, almost 50 years ahead from Today. We can be happy with films like Uri and Shershaah as our masses and TV audience would never complain about it so Yes, Shershaah is definitely watchable. Director Vishnuvardhan has certainly made a watchable film. But never forget that the potential for Biographical-War drama is always unlimited, and like I said not every film can be 'Patton'. So, overall Shershaah has everything one can expect from a commercial patriotic drama and i strongly believe that it deserved to be viewed on big screen.RATING - 6.5/10*",

Most importantly - Siddharth Malhotra is such pathetic actor, sorry, he's not even actor as well. He's good in romantic movies of KJO only. When it comes to acting - most of the time he copies Shahrukh Khan, means only over acting. But - Bollywood directors don't know even casting.It's a over hyped movie. One can watch documentaries on Capt Batra, can read about him. That would be more knowledgeable and you will be better to understand about courage. And not by watching this movie at all..",

            "content": "An Indian Hindi war biopic drama; A story about the life of Indian Army officer Vikram Batra, awarded for valour for his actions during the 1999 Kargil War, an armed conflict fought between India and Pakistan from May to July 1999 in the Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir. The film outlines the affable and brave life of the soldier and pays homage to the hundreds of lives lost in Operation Vijay. However, it channels patriotism that limits the film's dramatic reach. The writer pounds the audience with dialogue about hero status when showing them would have sufficed. The surplus of scenes showing Batra facing ordnance and enemy fire forced spectacle to be the casualty. There are moving moments though, and nicely captured humour too, albethey confined to romantic interludes in Batra's civilian life. As for the war itself, there are some beautifully photographed landscapes and the action set-pieces are well choreographed in foreground. All in all, the film is watchable, flourishing in parts and the performances are all very good, but the direction is uneven.",

We need to take a leaf out of hollywood when make such movies without diluting the real purpose.Shershah tells the story of Capt Vikram Batra's exemplary courage during the Kargil war. The movie could have been much more effective if it would have been crisp and avoided unnecessary songs .Biggest drawback of the movie is no connect with the viewers as it lacked the soul, emotion or essence that a war movie and a great martyr s story should induce. Poor direction and screenplay does not add to the movie. Acting is average and Siddhartha Malhotra is not able to spark the exuberance and charm of Captain Batra which can be felt by his original clippings towards the end of the movie. Moreover, Karan Johar has taken care his love for Pakistan. The whole movie gets over before you realize who was the actual culprit .A movie that could have been a great treat on the eve of our Independence Day has been merely reduced to a poor commercial flick.",

For me it felt very rushed; their hardwork and efforts and risk-taking was painted rather loosely. I wish these sequences were executed in more details and more grit.Siddharth Malhotra performed very nicely and this is the second performance of his that I have liked after 'Hasee Top Phasee'.One major dislike I have about this film is the spoken Punjabi. It was simply terrible and a bit cringy. But I can ignore that cos most of the audience won't feel it.My major problem with this film is that it needed more time to develop and showcase all the hardships our soldiers, our boys went through. At times the film felt a bit cliched; same old Madhuri Dixit bit, Pakistanis were the typical caricatures.The best thing about this film is the depiction and look-costume-feel of the armed forces; very seemingly authentic. And the telling of this legendary story that is needed to be told again and again.My ratings: 6/10 ******\nDefinitely worth watching at least once. I wish it was so much more.",

Still, it packs some well-choreographed gunfire sequences, exhilarating action set pieces, catchy dialogues , a few soulful melodies and a solid, gritty comeback performance by Siddharth makes Shershaah a stream-worthy watch.Thoughts\nShershaah is average. A film dedicated to a braveheart of India and the intensity drastically keeps drifting due to the commercial elements and sometimes irrelevant conversations. As long as the film stays focused on relevant true facts it stays grounded and on top but when the commercial dramatization comes into play it shatters the screenplay. The film packs some beautiful songs, action set pieces in the second half is quite exhilarating and tension filled to watch too. A brilliant effort by Siddharth to regain his mane as a leading actor.

The portrayal of the adrenaline-rushness in war is a plus point. The biography of Vikram Batra as a courageous patriot is well shown. The script is tight, but characters are less deeply explored. The war scenes are impressive. The movie restricts itself to a few aspects of a soldier's life. Love career Duty and emphasize mainly upon the glorious tasks of the protagony. Siddharth Malhotra did well his part and is praiseworthy.Vikram Batra's job is itself an emotional issue that appeals to entire country. May he be in peace for his fearless devotion towards the Motherland. A full 73/ 100.",

He was an officer of the Indian Army, who got posthumously awarded with the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest and most prestigious award for valour, for his actions during the 1999 Kargil War in Kashmir between India and Pakistan.It's not just a typical war movie but is a life story of a national hero. This movie showed different sides of capt. Vikram Batra's personality which made us love him more. He was more than a war hero. He had a filmy, sweet lover in him too. The whole movie was a mix of so much emotions. Climax had me in tears. The love story was unique and beyond expectations. Really felt a big respect of Dimple mam.Starting from the promotional JaiHind ki Senaa; all the songs including Raatan lambiyan and Raanjha was masterpieces.Sidharth Malhotra He lived the character. Totally nailed it. Each and every emotion was nicely potrayed.Surely his best performance so far.Acting out a real life character is not an easy task.Talking about Kiara Advani, Kiara has done a good job and I am quite impressed with her accent particularly the Punjabi speaking skills she has shown in the film. Worth taking a note of it.Lastly I would say, you can watch this film more than once. So good is the film. I would also thank the makers for displaying photos and names of the original war heroes in the end part of the film. These army men deserve their glory and honor. We are all proud of them.",

He is one of the if not the most popular heroes of Kargil war. This movie tries it's best but the unseasoned director and writer failed to rise to the epicness that Cap. Vikram Batra was.What lacks here is the thrill that was present in Uri or LOC Kargil. Despite knowing the outcome, if you're still able to keep your audience on edge of the seat ... That's film making. Though the action was shot beautifully, due to lack of character development the stakes feel so low because we know we have won.Thankfully cinematography keeps you hooked to the screen. Never have I seen beautiful but deadly valleys amd mountains of Kashmir captured so beautifully. I wish I could see this movie in theatre. Another thing this movie misses out is the sound design,which Uri excelled in. The background noise of war, bullets, explosions were very one dimensional.VFX was good but shabby in bullet wounds. Background score was underwhelming. Acting of leads and support cast was strictly okay. Sidharth Malhotra delivers his career best but not apt for the legend he is playing.I cried tears of pride and loss when I watched Uri, LoC Kargil ...even Border. While I came close I didn't feel as much as I did for those movies. Unfortunately I won't be rewatching this but I liked it for one time watch. Hope someone else will re do and do justice to the hero Cap. Vikram Batra was.",

Infact the movie was so into the bravery of Bikram that every other Soldier is portrayed as coward. This isn't how you win a war or you justify the contribution of a brave martyr.Initial battle scenes shows no military strategy, fear, or risk at all.And here comes the worst part: The final battle scene is so rushed as if the actual war had lasted for an hour or so and the story moves like the soldiers are going for some kind of picnic at a hill station. Plus it lacks the intensity of a realtime war where nearly 600 men died. Perhaps to show that less gore is primarily due to Director's ego to show less damage to the Indian military.All in all the movie seems like someone is telling me the story rather than living through the movie itself.Instead try watching Dunkirk or 12 strong. You will know how the real war is like.Karan Johar will absolutely make huge money with this movie by cashing into patriotism but it brings the quality of bollywood cinema fairly down.I'm giving 2stars for few average scenes here and there.

Trust Karan Johar to bring romance and drama in a story that should be handled exclusively for the substance that the main subject of the movie should bring. The movie failed to inspire as it should have and it was a drag in the middle.The character building for the protagonist missed highlighting critical aspects of how Capt Batra joined NCC and was adjudged the best NCC Air Wing Cadet of Punjab and later was promoted to Senior Under Officer (SUO) and subsequently was selected for the Republic Day Parade (which is a matter of great honour) all leading upto his decision to join the Indian Army. However, he has been shown as a 'happy-go-lucky' guy who nurtures this boyish dream to join the army without any disciplined efforts towards that, which is of course not the case. Vikram (not then captain) trying to get liquor only meant for the army, was so misplaced and seemed so disjointed as a scene. Looked like it just had to be crammed in. Important aspect of character building was missed where he went for a commando course to Belgaum and got the highest grading possible and excelled in it. Clearly a part of character building, which has been ignored in favour of showing some other drama and romancing.The movie is factually wrong on minor accounts and for a biopic, it is unforgivable. Not sure how Capt Batra's family accepted some of these fallacies, if at all permission was sought from them.All in all, this movie, while a poor attempt, is an insult to a soldier like Capt Batra. Could have been made so much better, with the right intent.This move is avoidable and if you want to see a movie which has the capacity to inspire, watch 'Lakshya' or 'Prahaar'.",

            "content": "\"Yeh Dil Maange More\"Movies on Nationalism are often castigated for their commonly seen melodramatic appearance or the redundancy in the specific pattern they tend to follow. For a film that appertains to Bollywood's mainstream lineup; Shershaah is comparatively more grounded and respectful of the source material!Technical competencies aside, the Director (Vishnuvardhan) ensured that the film stays on the path of verisimilitude. Regardless, it gets ever so slightly exaggerated at certain points but for the most part; Vishnuvardhan's vision has been hell-bent on doing it in the most believable way possible.Sticking with my earlier statement, I find the technical sides to be pretty darn impressive. Given the fact that it is coming from Bollywood (They don't have as much budget as Hollywood or other foreign film industries); Got to admit, I was stupefied just looking at all those expertly choreographed combats, further intensified by an incredible Score that truly elevated the anxiety as well as the fervor in a few.Moving forward to the Performances...Since the day of the announcement; fans were eager to witness Siddharth Malhotra as Capt. Vikram Batra. Needless to say, he seized this opportunity and rose to the occasion! I firmly believe that this would be remembered as one of Siddharth's career highlights. On the other end, despite having a somewhat less important, short-lived role; Kiara Advani played her part with complete dedication and full commitment. Not to mention, the great chemistry these two seem to share.I see some reviewers are arguing about the Non-War segments; especially referring to the Love Story. I think they are completely missing the point. This isn't a film about Kargil War or Operation Vijay, it is utterly dedicated to Captain Vikram Batra's courageous feats. It was rather a necessity to rightly establish Batra's personal life so that we as the audience could connect to him at a more personal level.And I have to say, they did very well in that regard!Before I conclude, I would like to pay my respects to all the Soldiers, Army Personnel who have sacrificed their lives just to keep us safe. They do all that is necessary for the sake of protecting our beloved country from the enemy forces. I, as a responsible citizen of India, couldn't be more proud of them.Thank you for your service!",

So I would say the director,editor and the screenplay writer deserve an applause for their extra hardworks that's visible in the narrative. I was pleasantly surprised by the cinematography and the score of the movie, such a nice treat. Personally, I am happy for Siddharth for this opportunity to explore his craft and proving that he has lot more to provide as an actor. I have always loved him and so maybe my regards for him might have been subjective but still the movie left a mark for him. The supporting casts are good in their roles. Overall, a fine movie that hits the right node as a Bollywood entertainer. It's always a pleasure to see the real footage and the people that the movie bases on so it was an appreciative tribute to the real heroes. Even as a non Indian movie lover, I approve the message that the movie hits its audience in right sentimental values\nWhat did not work:\nMaybe I would have been happier if the movie had paused on the main character's introspection, his vulnerabilities, his moments at the camp or the training scenes so that we could gather more depth of his principles and his way of life as an army. Just an open suggestion.Final verdict: highly recommended. I would have been happier for Siddharth if the movie was released on theaters because it would have definitely banked some long term investment for him.",

            "content": "I can't evaluate how true Shershaah is to its subject, the late Capt. Vikram Batra who showed exceptional bravery during the Kargil war. But as a film, it comes off formulaic and pat. As played by Siddharth Malhotra, Capt. Batra's character has FILMI HERO written all over him - he makes cute wisecracks, is loved by all, barely breaks a sweat while putting down bad guys, and has an unimaginative romance track (Kiara Advani trying to make the most of an underwritten part, but then everyone in this movie is). Overall Shershaah has the shallow feel of a feature-length ad film rather than the emotionally involving saga of a brave warrior.Just skimming over the wiki article on Batra, I'm actually puzzled at the interesting things that were left out from his life to make it fit the generic hagiography template. POTENTIAL SPOILERS DISCUSSED AHEAD.Vikram and his brother Vishal were twins born just minutes apart. This could have made for an interesting running element in the narrative, but it is only kept for a poorly conceived last minute surprise (especially since it is Sid Mal's voice heard doing the voiceover for the eulogy at the start). Vikram's relationship with his family is depicted in a perfunctory and cliched manner, not even having the emotional attachment that classic Bollywood could be so good at.In a more important dramatic omission, before his last battle (for point 4875), Vikram was physically unwell, down with fever. It was when he saw that the enemy was gaining over the Indian forces, that he volunteered despite his illness to fight and several of his colleagues pleaded to go with him. If true, this was a much more intense narrative than the bland tick-marking manner in which his Kargil conquests are depicted on the screen.",

Later, Varun and Alia raced ahead with successful films while the Malhotra dude lagged behind. With Karan Johar's latest production Shershaah which released on Amazon Prime on Friday, Sidharth proves his mettle as a fine actor who can shine under the right script and a competent director.A biopic on Param Veer Chakra awardee Kargil war hero Captain Vikram Batra, Shershaah has some awe-inspiring battle sequences giving you a feel of actually being right there with our Indian Army jawaans as they take on the Pakistani infiltration of 1999. The technical aspects are first rate, the background score perfectly suits the context and the presentation consciously avoids unnecessary jingoism. Director Vishnuvardhan makes a super Bollywood debut and full credit to him for making a touching film which will make your eyes moist in the end.The performances are top class - Sidharth delivers his career best as Capt. Batra. Kiara Advani is earnest playing his lady love. Nikitin Dheer looks convincing as Capt. Batra's senior. So does Shiv Pandit. As the end credits roll, we get to see all the real life heroes of the war and it is then you realise how the actors playing them on screen are perfectly cast in these roles.Shershaah deserved a theatrical release but has made it to OTT in these covid times. I recommend a watch with family and friends. The film is truly inspiring and makes you feel proud of our army bravehearts for whom India is above their own life.

Here are the positives and negatives:\nPerformances:can i just say that kiara is too cute and sweet. She looks even more cute while crying. Apart from this, her acting is top class. Shiv pandit, sahil vaid, and every other cast member has given commendable performance in their limited screen time. Kudos to the casting director as well.Sidharth malhotra:this man has given every inch of his craft into this role. A preparation of five years has brought the result. A standout performance , nothing less. Especially in the war sequences, his eyes speak the most. That valour, that glory, that happiness is conveyed so beautifully. He has silenced all his haters astoundingly.Bgm amd music:the bgm is top notch. The tension, the thumpbeat is so well crafted. Music is excellent. Soulful and meaningful to ever last word. Personal fav remains 'ranjha'.Action choreography and combat sequences: one of the highlights of this film is its action sequences and war scenes. Wonderfully designed, detailed and masterfully done. The hand to hand combat is good as well.Vfx and special effects:special mention to red chillies entertainment. They in the whole vfx portion are by miles ahead of any other production comp. Realistic and believable vfx and special effects.Accent:sidhart's accent was good to be honest but kiara's accent looked a bit odd at times. It was evident that she was trying to be natural but could not. My only gripe with this film.Jingoism and patriotism: there is a fine line between these two things and thankfully shershaah does not try to be jingoistic and does not promote chauvinism. There are small details involving the pakistani flag which is worth noticeable. Patriotism beautifully portrayed.",

Sid has given a terrific performance and so did AB Jr. Then. The difference is that in this film, Sid is in main focus whereas in the latter case, he wasn't the prime focus.Third, the VFX! Well executed VFX was always needed in a war film and the makers have done a commendable job in this field. The explosions look real, the fires look real but the only thing that bothered me was the wallpaper like background in the mountains.Fourth, the action! Well executed and keeps you engrossed in those final moments.Fifth, the romance! Dont complain as this is an integral part of Capt. VB's life and it was pretty decent.Sixth, the emotional connect with the other soldiers which i felt was missing a bit and this is where a slightly longer film would have helped.Lastly, the climax.

After disastrous Gunjan Saxena and Janhvi's pathetic act Dharma productions did redeem itself to very well, this was definitely one of the best war/patriotic/biopic film to have come out in recent times.As we all know the story of Captain Vikram Batra's life, this film translates it onscreen very well. Be it his time on field, in romantic avatar or Kargil War Shershaah neither drags things out, nor does it rush it too soon instead follows the pace very well. And the biggest risk factor about this film was casting of Siddharth Malhotra, not only he gave he redeemed himself well but also gave his career best performance in his career best film! Hoping to see more of Sid in future, he's definitely bounced back compared to his other student fellows(Varun and Alia with 2-3 consecutive disasters). While Sid was definitely carrying the film on his shoulder, shouldn't ignore the support cast at all. Kiara Advani too supported the film beautifully, her chemistry with Sid was heart warming and didn't seem forced at all. Shiv Pandit, Nikitin Dheer, Anil Charanjeet, Sahil Vaid and Raj Arun all of them did equally fantastic job! My only complain remained was I wished to see more of Vishal Batra(Siddharth again in guest role and narrator) to give more insights into love of both the twins, sadly it was used only in childhood days.The best thing besides Sid's performance was its pacing, direction, screenplay, VFX shots, action sequences everything just looked pitch perfect! Despite of having some usual cliches like over the top patriotic dialogues the way how they were delivered was equally realistic. And just when I thought Bollywood directors are getting better, I realised it was directed by Vishnuvardhan, a Tamil director known for Tamil films like Billa etc, this might as well be even his best as I haven't seen his other work yet. I really wished this film was a theatrical release and not an OTT presentation, imagining this film releasing in theatres already gives goosebumps! Going with 9 stars as not every film is perfect.",

While varun and alia(with whom he debuted) became superstars with various critically acclaimed and commercial blockbusters, sid still remained struggling to find his place. Though he was versatile in film selection, he never got any role where he could prove his talent or charisma. But with shershaah, he showed that both.Shershaah is a biopic of PVC kargil war hero Captain Vikram Batra. Well, captain batra was already portrayed by abhishek bachchan in loc kargil, but here we get to know his life and career in detail. Film portrays the rise of captain batra in the Indian army and his contribution and ultimate sacrifice in the kargil war. Also, it showcases his love story with dimple cheema.What I liked the most about shershaah was its minimal tone of jingoism and patriotism. Its not overdone like those jp dutta war films. I liked its first half more than the second half because it was the right mixture of fun, romance, emotion, action and thrill. The love story of vikram and dimple was decent. War sequences were pretty good.Coming to performances, sidharth malhotra gave a sincere performance as Vikram Batra. For the first time, I saw his charisma on screen, thanks to vikram batra's heroic personality. He easily got into the skin of the character. Kiara advani also gave a very memorable performance as dimple and both sid and kiara's chemistry was good. Rest of the supporting actors had small roles and they did it well. Tamil director vishnuvardhan's direction is good.On the whole, shershaah is one of the best biopics which ever came in Bollywood. Its not only relief for sidharth malhotra but also for karan johar and dharma productions who received lot of flak last year.",

Why everyone keeps repeating the obvious things without any depth in sentences?2. Why such poor VFX when the base gets bombed by enemy or certain fire scenes?

Why his entire battalion and 3 levels of senior officers behave like his fan boys from the moment he arrives at the base?5. Were the romantic songs really needed? Did you not see how misplaced they were in 'LOC Kargil' or even 'Border'?6. And last .. why our Protagonist keeps hand grenades in front pocket of his shirt? And keeps taking them out like a pen to give autographs..!!!!I can go on and on.. but seriously pathetic attempt!!A biopic on a Real Life Hero's valour and sacrifice need to be celebrated but you guys turned entire exercise into a Caricaturish Attempt !!Sheer disgrace literally..PS Siddharth, Kiara and Shiv Pandit performed really well but how I wish overall script and execution were better thought through!",

            "content": "I try to look at movies based on heroic true stories from two perspectives - the actual real-life story and the actual movie + the storytelling.The real-life story:\nThe tale of Captain Vikram Batra, his and his team's role in the Kargil War are very inspiring. Makes you take a step back from the \"busy life\" and appreciate the sacrifices that armed forces and their family members have made and continue to make. It's one thing to watch a movie and say that, and a totally different thing to live that life. Simpletons like us would never know what it actually feels like to be on the frontlines or in the shoes of their families.The movie + the storytelling:\nMy initial thoughts were that, AS A MOVIE, it was a tad too filmy, but after reading about Cpt. Batra, I understand why it was made this way. Turns out, his personality was filmy and a lot of the dialogues/quotes in the movie were actually stuff that he used to say. I don't think this should be watched like it's a war movie, but the movie about the life of a soldier. And I say that to tame your expectations because you might leave with the feeling of something missing/not satisfied.The Good:\nThe music was good, the I really liked the VFX - loved this one scene in which you get an aerial view of a missile being launched on to the ground, the visuals must have been hard work. Looks like they've also filmed parts of the movie in difficult terrain, so props for that. The acting was also well done by everyone.You can tell that you're watching a movie about the real-deal until the final few mins and the montage that was well done. It hits you like \"Damn, I can't imagine what it must be like!\". It serves as a good transition to some real-life footage.The Bad:\nThe language, the accent - the characters saying the first few words in Punjabi and then abruptly switching to proper Hindi for the rest of the scene was very distracting. I get that you can't make a Bollywood movie with proper Punjabi, but too often movies seem to have this issue and I wonder if the writers can help in fixing this?The dialogues between the Colonel and the Captain sounded weird. Compare this to the chemistry that Amitabh and Hrithik have in Lakshya and you'll get what I'm talking about. This actor made made the orders sound like he was asking for too much, vs Amitabh's dialogue delivery sounded more authentic.I also didn't like this one particular scene around the 1:57:30 mark, like \"Come on, movie makers! Really? You've got to make it filmy NOW?\"\nOverall:\nThe story and the storytelling take me back to Lakshya, and I wonder if that was \"inspired\" by the story of Shershaah along with a bunch of changes? And because of that, I am unable to like this movie as much as I'd want to.Overall, as a movie, this was a good one-time watch but the real-life story though, much respect!

The antagonists in the movie are fleshed out a little as well, they have a reliable backstory and correct motivation, who know what to do next, but the Indian soldiers were the ones who stole the show, the Indian soldiers were given very well justice, and there was no agenda in this movie whatsoever which felt forceful.

Not that I didn't like the film, I don't understand the reason of giving this movie a perfect score when it doesn't seem like getting one. I watched the film uri and if you analyse both carefully, the pattern was almost the same - an Indian Army aspirant is shown, his love life is shown, he is depicted as a saint ( as if he never did anything bad in his life). This is followed by a sudden attack from militants ( whose side of story is never shown) and the hero's friends die. Then the hero gets agitated and pledges to kill every last one of them. Then there is sone covert ops where they slay the enemis... End of the story. And not to forget about some random patriotic slogans which fire up the viewer's heart and then he/she goes on to rate the movie 10/10, pff. I like movies like Haider where they show their side of story and tell how they end up being their own worst enemy, how they actually are pathetic, and how some of them are just dragged into this against their will. Shershaah has also shown some of such elements which I appreciate. I respect Indian Army but, doodh ke dhule shudh toh woh bhi nahi hain. Please don't get me wrong for this, the film was great, but a sound mind will get what I am trying to criticise here.",

And thankfully, they have made a superb film that will really resonate with audiences and pay due homage to the Param Veer Chakra awardee.Siddharth Malhotra's limited acting chops is adeptly managed by the director by using body language and a fantastic supporting cast that includes the brilliant Kiara Advani, Shiv Pandit and Raj Arjun.The iconic Barkha Dutt interview and the legendary 'Dil Maange More' catchphrase sequences are delivered with enough punch and verve to get your adrenaline pumping. This has to be the best Indian war movie yet in terms of production value with the high-elevation fight sequences shot with Hollywood-level panache.Director Vishnu Vardhan deftly switches between the soldier's life in the army and his budding romance with his college sweetheart, giving us a glimpse into both the warrior and the human side of the legendary war-hero.A special shout out is needed for the fantastic music and BGM from maestro Yuvan Shankar Raja that really elevates the narration, especially in the emotional sequences. The climax song will hardly leave a dry eye in the house.Captain Vikram Batra was a true braveheart and I am thankful that this is a tribute film deserving of the great man. Recommended!",

There is no great pride than wearing a soldier's uniform, and there is no religion greater than one's country.This movie does excellent job of portraying how difficult of a job being a soldier is. Those who we don't know sacrifice themselves for our sake.My girlfriend was crying after interval when she realised that Captain Batra will not be able to fulfill his promise to his beloved.One of the best war film ever made in bollywood just because this movie didn't care about the pseudo secularism that has destroyed whole Hollywood and slowly now destroying Bollywood.",

The film chronicles his childhood to his joining the army in his early years and his conviction to fight for the country. It superbly details the war fought, and is excellent in terms of documentation. Technically it's brilliantly made. But what it lacks is the emotional nuances in the characters. Still the emotional rawness of \"Haqeeqat\" released in the 60s hasn't been achieved in the recent war sagas. Overall, it makes a fair watch in terms of story; but lack of emotional nuances disappoints.Rating: 2 stars out of 4.",

Also as\na kid Vikram is super ugly but adult Vikram is pretty hot (no homosexual) but this made it pretty confusing to tell it was him. (I. D. K. If this is a spoiler) The original songs were very mid, but perhaps my expectations have been inflated since my viewings of the legendary 2021's 83 as well as the iconic 3 Idiots, both known for their groundbreaking musical numbers. In conclusion, this movie is mid. It is better than the steaming pile of horse s word that is 3 Idiotas, so it is a valid alternative. Thus, Rajesh somewhat recommends. It is not a waste of time to watch, but Rajesh will not be granting it a second viewing. I would much rather spend my 3 hours experiencing 83 for a seventh time.5/10\n-Rajesh P.",

And that is never a solution.URI disturbed me with it's army-mentality and millitary-bravado. Glamourizing wars!Because of all that, I was very hesitant to watch this movie.But Shershah has what URI lacked, i.e. EMPATHY and Heart.Also, I differ with people critiquing Kiara or her character for lacking depth. But I sincerely disagree. She has a character and a personality. She warns, disagrees, takes initiative and much more.Point being. This is a Vikram Batra movie, NO Character except the protagonist is given any extra screen time. The movie revolves around it.I respect and appreciate that the whole second half of the movie deals with the war only. But that half could've been better and felt underwhelming after the first half (jus too much firing and grenade).Of course, I could be biased here, as I'm anti-war. And also, battleground is serious business and not* supposed to be entertaining.Needless to say that, the music jus takes your heart away. And you'll keep humming it for days to come.Genuine doubt- why only Indians climbing the mountain are using grenade and cannon.

            "content": "Kargil War in 1999 was the first \"televised\" war that Indians experienced. Tales of valour and sacrifice against impossible odds were broadcasted every day to millions of people across the country. When the conflict ended in late July 1999, the towering peaks of Kargil and surrounding areas were immortalised with legends who continue to inspire today.One such legend is Capt. Vikram Batra of 13 Jammu & Kashmir Rifles who was awarded India's highest military decoration- Param Vir Chakra. While an earlier movie in 2003 (LOC: Kargil) had paid tributes to his ultimate sacrifice within a broader script about the Kargil war, SHERSHAAH is a movie made exclusively on the late Captain's daredevilry during which he led one of the most difficult mountain warfare operations in Indian history. His codename during the battle was Shershaah.What adds credibility to the narration is the late Captain's family involvement and also inputs and anecdotes of his life through his twin brother- Vishal Batra. The movie is very well made and touches on many aspects of the legend's life. This without doubt is Sidharth Malhotra's finest performance and will go a long way in resurrecting his career. In the second half of the movie and especially in the war scenes, he fits into the role of Capt. Vikram Batra amazingly well.The highlight of the movie is of course the execution of the battle sequences that will make the viewers understand the magnitude of the Kargil War and the next to impossible odds the Indian Army was faced with. The ending sequence of the movie will stay with the viewers for a long long time as it is so moving- captures the essence of the biopic perfectly and a great tribute indeed.As for the rest of the cast, Kiara Advani performs well in the role of the Captain's love interest. Shiv Pandit as Vikram Batra's colleague and friend- Capt. Sanjeev Jamwal is good. Also, Nikitin Dheer as Maj. Ajay Singh Jasrotia and. Shataf Figar as the commanding officer- Lt. Col YK Joshi are commendable.Overall, a very well made movie and a great tribute to one of the legends of the Indian Army. Like Capt. Vikram Batra who immortalised a cola slogan, I hope the viewers too have the feeling of \"Yeh Dil Maange More\" when the movie ends. Jai Hind!",

The story line is linear and potrays the young officer as a monochromatic chracter whose only ambition is to go to war albeit being borderline insurbordinate and reckkless. The movie glosses over how his superior officers send his company out on back to back difficult mission without regard to troop wearout.The performance of the cast is 7/10 with requeried bollywood cliches and dance numbers. In the hands of a better director, the moview could have been about the tragedy of loss of life of a promising young man in the name of war but here it is glorified into a masala flick ready to mint box office gold. 4/10.",

The film is terrifically made and is beautifully backed by superb acting, mesmerizing music, great action scenes and superb VFX. The best pat of the film is that the film doesn't have unnecessary masala and had mostly stayed with the facts.Acting is superb and both Sidharth Malhotra, Kiara Advani were perfect fit for the role and it seems that the roles was tailormade for them. Support cast were equally impressive.Screenplay of the film was beautiful and will keep you hooked, there was not a single moment that it seems that the film is derailing from it's path.

Tbh I am the kind of person who generally does not enjoy war films, but this movie literally kept me on the edge of my seat for the 2 hrs. The actors were especially mind-blowing. Sidharth finally gave a strong answer to the haters who said that he can't act, and Kiara also didn't failed to play her character at the fullest. The plot, the acting, the dialogues, the songs, the direction, everything is just so perfect that you wouldn't want to miss watching the filmAlthough I felt that the love story of the film seems a bit streched at one point, but then I understood that it's basically trying to tell us how the girlfriends/wives of army officers fall in love with their partners, without knowing that whether they have a future together or not. The ending part *SPOILER ALERT* where the Indian flag is waved at the end, it just fills your heart with patriotism and you feel proud of all the freedom fighters and soldiers who sacrificed their lives and are still continuing to do so for the country and it's people. And the way Kiara cries at the funeral just broke my heart into million pieces. That scene makes you feel the pain of all the people who experienced this situation in real life, it makes you realise how much heartbreaking it might be for the family members of soldiers who actually lost their loved one in the warOverall this film is one of the best films of 2021, and if u still haven't watched it, then u are committing a mistake. Don't pay attention to the negative reviews, I am sure u are going to enjoy this film.",

            "content": "Shershaah is a well-made biopic on Captain Vikram Batra. The tone of the film has been kept at a very realistic level, there are no over the top action sequences and no unnecessary shouting or chest thumping. Siddharth Malhotra looks really good on screen as a young army man, and he has done a decent job in the film, but one can see that his acting range is quite limited. Kiara Advani, who has a very strong resemblance to Suparna Marwah, looks extremely beautiful and has acted really well in the film. I was initially worried that the songs and flashback sequences would break the flow of the film and slow it down, but fortunately none of that happened, the flashback sequences were used really well in the film and the songs were quite enjoyable. In fact I was invested equally in the past as well as the present storyline. There was one particular flaw in the film that stuck out like a sore thumb throughout the film. The movie shows a lot of bonhomie between Kashmiri people and the army men, that's not exactly a correct depiction of how things are in Kashmir. I understand, that this movie was telling the story of a hero and also trying to stay away from controversies, but that was a bit too much.The song towards the climax really hits you hard, and while watching Dimple (Kiara Advani) cry makes you wonder how difficult it must be for families to send their children in the army, knowing that they might never come back. There are plenty of people in this world who think of wars as video games, get charged up just at the thought of it and want to finish every problem with guns and bombs, but they never think of what goes on in the mind of that soldier who actually has to enter the war-zone and fight. The soldier, who has kids as well, that he or she might never get to see again. Not everyone thinks about those soldiers, perhaps they should, only then we will understand the futility of wars.Shershaah is not at par with Lakshya (2004), Siddharth Malhotra is most definitely not as good as Hrithik Roshan, but it's a well-made film that deserves to be watched.",

            "content": "\"Shershaah\" (for the uninitiated, it is the codename for Captain Vikram Batra of the Indian Armed Forces, who led his unit to thwart the Pakistani army infiltration in Kargil) is a remarkable film that ticks all the boxes. It keeps the viewer glued to the screen, runs focused and taut, is an edge of the seat thriller with excellent production values, and is supplanted on a mammoth commercial scale. It is sleek, boasts of superlative editing by A. Sreekar Prasad, cinematography by Kamaljeet Negi, music by Y. S. Raja, and of some spectacular VFX by a team that should easily qualify for top awards. Shershaah, helmed by Vishnuvardhan is undoubtedly a film that's out to grab a whole lot of attention, admiration, accolades and leaves a strong imprint on the hearts and minds about the life of a fearless and exemplary individual.Shershaah achieves a lot more than just that. It doesn't waste time on gimmicks like Pakistan-bashing and remains steady on the biopic of Captain Vikram Batra, its key objective. It has an understated glamour keeping in tune with the protagonist's background, education, family, love life and his one dimensional determination to achieve his objective. It races down to the finishing line at an admirable speed, that left me at least with a an emotion of \"yeh dil maange more\"! Shershaah could play for a few minutes more, and I wouldn't complain.Siddharth Malhotra comes to life with perhaps what I would label as his best performance. He is uninhibited, impulsive, expressive in an understated manner and immensely likeable. I am certain that Captain Vikram Batra would have been proud and happy to see that Siddharth Malhotra has done justice. Shataf Figar as Col. Y. K. Joshi adds gravitas and is impressive as the officer who had faith in Batra, allowing him to lead a strategic fightback to retrieve lost ground. Kiara Advani has a brief role but is delightful. Shiv Panditt, Raj Arjun, Nikitin Dheer and Pawan Chopra are great support. In the end, Shershaah leaves you teary eyed and emotional, filled with passion, stirring up patriotism and a renewed appreciation for the armed forces. Don't miss Shershaah, it's perhaps the best film of the year.",

If that's the case, why are so many people siding with them? Instead of depicting flimsy bad people, a more fair and honest approach might make the film more engaging. Of course, the film is about the Indian army, and the camaraderie is brilliantly depicted. The battle sequences are excellent, and the romance element was unnecessary; if it had been omitted, the film would have been tighter, more organized, and shorter than it is now.Overall, it was a one-time viewing, and the final scene, in which the real Vikram Batra was seen, was quite moving.

Vikram Batra (Sidharth Malhotra) stays with his parents in Palampur, Himachal and his twin brother, Vishal Batra. Since the time he was a child, he was interested in joining the army. At college, he meets Dimple (Kiara Advani) and falls for her. She reciprocates his love and both start a relationship. At this point, Vikram decides to join the merchant navy instead of the army as it pays better. One day, when Vikram drops Dimple home, Dimple's father (Bijay J Anand) catches them red-handed. He tells Vikram that since he belongs to a different caste, he can't marry Dimple. Dimple, however, protests and even tells her father that Vikram would earn more than him since he's going to join the merchant navy. Meanwhile, Vikram starts getting second thoughts after his best friend Sunny (Sahil Vaid) insists that he should not give up his dream of joining the army. Vikram tells Dimple about his change of plans. This infuriates Dimple and she requests him not to make any more changes in future plans. Vikram then enrols himself at an army institute and passes with flying colours. In 1998, he gets his first posting at 13th Jammu and Kashmir Rifles at Sopore. Vikram is now a Lieutenant. His regiment comprises Lieutenant Sanjeev Jamwal (Shiv Panditt), Naib Sudebar Bansi Lal Sharma (Anil Charanjeett), Subedar Raghunath (Raj Arjun), Major Subrata Mukherjee (Abhiroy Singh) and Major Ajay Jasrotia aka Jassi (Nikitin Dheer), etc. In no time, Vikram proves his worth when he manages to capture a dreaded terrorist, Attaullah (David Browne), who's a part of the gang of an evil militant, Haider (Mir Sarwar). Vikram also befriends locals, unlike other soldiers. This proves to be of great help as a friendly local, Gafoor (Zahoor Zaidi), informs him that his son Arslaan (Afnan Ashia) has joined Haider's gang but wants to leave them. Meanwhile, Haider attacks 13th Jammu and Kashmir Rifles while they were moving as an act of revenge for capturing Attaullah. Naib Sudebar Bansi Lal Sharma loses his life in this attack. Arslaan helps Vikram as he tells the latter about Haider's hideout. In a risky operation, Vikram leads his team to the hideout and manages to capture and eliminate Haider. Before his death, Haider however warns Vikram that something big and devastating is going to happen soon. What happens next forms the rest of the film.",

Stories based on Army like this one will always have mass appeal if made well, as in this case.Fans of Sidharth Malhotra have reasons to celebrate because this is one of his finest performances and is easily the highlight of the movie. The scenes of his college life, his wooing of Kiara, and his interactions with his seniors/ colleagues are enacted well by him. Though a biopic with the customer stipulation that some real life incidents may have been modified for dramatic purposes, such variations are minimum because the inputs to the screenplay have come from living relations and Army officers who were close to Captain Vikram Batra. The movie is interesting and does not drag anywhere. The jingoism is kept under check.Since Vikram was a lively and humour loving lad, his character in the movie is sketched accordingly. This is in sharp contrast to a serious Army officer portrayed in \" Uri\". This is the different aspect of the film and director Vishnuvardhan needs to be complimented for making a likeable and realistic movie. The emotional scenes are sensitively handled. Is there an excess of war scenes.? Not exactly since the screenplay required it.",

            "content": "Shershaah is a great tribute to our brave Indian soldier PVC Vikram Batra, who laid down his life during the 1999 Indo-Pakistan war. The title comes from Batra's codename in Kargil. Vishnuvardhan's direction is top-notch and he makes an impressive debut in the Hindi film. He handles the film very well when it comes to the war scenes as well as in the emotional scenes it does not look overdramatic.The inspirational story is well-researched and the writer did not just keep their focus on Vikram Batra's achievements as an army officer but they also explored his romantic and emotional side. Sandeep Shrivastava's screenplay is fast-paced and gripping which keeps viewers hooked till the climax.The movie starts on a promising note with a war scene that will set high expectations for the audience. Sandeep Shrivastava's dialogues are good and go well with the scenes. And some dialogues are clap-worthy too: \"I would come back either with the Indian flag or draped in it\". \"We live by chance, we love by choice, we kill by profession\". \"There is no other status greater than the status of a soldier, there is no greater glory than the glory of a uniform, there is no religion greater than our country\".Sidharth Malhotra delivers the best performance of his career and his performance evolves through the film. He shines in the war scenes and completely done justice to the titular role. This film gave him a lot of scopes to showcase his acting chops. Kiara Advani gets an underwritten role and she doesn't have much scope to perform. The parallel love track between Sidharth and Kiara has some light moments. Shiv Panditt as Captain Sanjeev Jamwal is reliable. Shataf Figar, Anil Charanjeett and Raj Arjun were good in their supporting roles.Kamaljeet Negi's cinematography is eye-catching and he beautifully captures the locales of Kashmir. The war scenes need a special mention here and the production design was impressive too. All the action sequences are very well choreographed by Stefan Richter and Sunil Rodrigues. Especially, the terrific scene where Vikram infiltrates into Haider's hideout and kills him. The battle scenes where the Indian army captures the two critical points Pt 5140 and then Pt 4875.The music is average and the songs are well-placed in the film. John Stewart Eduri's background score is impactful. Do not miss the end credits, the makers beautifully pays an ode and list out the names of the soldiers in Vikram Batra's regiment with the photographs and the accolades won by them.Sheershah Movie Rating:\nDirection 3.5/5\nActing 3.5/5\nDialogues 3/5\nStory 4/5\nScreenplay 3.5/5.",

His undying enthusiasm and softness to fellow soldiers were nicely narrated but the script doesn't tell you who made him like that. Still the cinematography and music supplements the script . Why Producers engaged a bunch of music directors for a war film , I didn't understand.Kiara Advani completes the love angle of a soldier and the Bollywood touch is visible in few scenes and in the dialogue, 'soldiers live by chance, love by choice and kill by profession' .

Ik this is not exactly glorifying war but I'm pretty sure that no soldiers walks and serves with carrying that as a desire. Film has nothing to offer which ain't been already served, there are ample of articles about Capt. Batra which has more to offer than this film, this film is no doubt a subdued tribute to Capt. Batra. The elements of Capt. Batra 's life had so much potential for multi-layered storytelling but 'Sharshan' missed it's shot. The war front sequences were good especially the first hill recapturing, as it had lil details to offer but the rest were mediocre at it's best.",

'URI' was an exception, but it had an artificial patriotism injected into it.Shershaah/Lion King has the authenticity of a biopic, devoid of fake Hindu-Muslim unity and artificial patriotism and ofcourse a world class making.Vishnuvaradhan who propelled Tamil actor Ajith into stardom with his 'Billa' a decade back recreated his magic of flawless story telling- with no unwanted sequences, even with a romatic side plot, this does keep the audience engaged with a very believable screenplay and a subtle yet strong patriotic feel. Doesn't matter the story arc, this must be how an army film is to be made.Siddharth Malhotra who came into the limelight a decade ago with Karan Johar's 'Student of The Year' failed to achieve stardom despite being talented and carrying his model looks. This film surely does justice in casting him and he did justice in depicting Captain Vikram Batra.The music score and VFX is by far the best in any Indian made army films. Pleasantly surprised how the film makers finally grew a brain to hire talent instead of cheap labour from south for stunt coordination.This film is good. May not be everyones cup of tea.

Bollywood is coming close but still, they need to work on CGI to make it look real. Next, background music during the fight scene was like hyping which makes the fight look poor. The sound of an actual fight is lost because of blasting music. It's something that 90% of movies do to make people feel excited but if someone looking for real touch then they won't feel it. The real story should be told in a way it feels real. Our soldiers did the ultimate sacrifice for their countries and when their story is told with help of hyped music, slow motions then it feels disrespectful to them.",

Kiara is good in her small part & so is the rest of the cast, I can't find fault in at least the main supporting cast. The one romantic song is melodious and thankfully there's not many songs in the movie, which is how a war movie should be.Wish I could watch this in cinema.Definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to see a good, close to reality movie.",

This movie showed different sides of capt. Vikram Batra's personality which made us love him more. He was more than a war hero. He had a filmy, sweet lover in him too. The whole movie was a mix of so much emotions. Climax had me in tears. The best cast I must say...their expressions were on point. Everything looked really authentic, raw and real. The love story was unique and beyond expectations. Really felt a big respect of Dimple maam.Starting from the promotional JaiHind ki Senaa; all the songs including Raatan lambiyan and Raanjha was masterpieces.Sidharth Malhotra! He lived the character. Totally nailed it. Each and every emotion was nicely potrayed. He deserves a national award for this performance.Surely his best performance so far. So proud of this man! All the hardwork he has put in is seen in the movie itself.Acting out a real life character is not an easy task. He truly has out done himself in this.Sid-kiara chemistry felt almost real and had a rare purenes which enhanced the bond between dimple and vikram.Kiara Advani did a great job.If Sidharth was the soul of the movie; Kiara was the heart of it. &Their combo rocked.Kudos to the whole Shershaah team; specially the director Vishnu Vardhan, thank you for bringing this alive.All their 5-year-hardwork has really worked out. Get ready for all the love and hopefully loads of awards team Shershaah!If this was released in theatres, this could've been EPIC! But yet this a truly is a blockbuster movie. A must watch!",

Watch the end-credits, which has an interview of Vikram Batra & you'll realize how amazingly well Sidharth has embodied him in the film's same scene. Kiara Advani's cuteness gives her character Dimple an alluring touch. I am so happy with the supporting characters they won my heart.As this is a biographical movie of Captain Vikram Batra known as Shershaah in army, this movie takes you to a journey of a young filmy Punjabi boy who wants to serve his nation as an army officer, how he fell in love with Dimple, his journey from university to army and celebrates his bravery in army.The screenplay and direction of the movie is sharp and engaging. Usually I don't like songs in movies but the timing of songs in this movie, the tune, lyrics made me fall in the love with the songs too. This is probably my first time where I loved the romantic portion in a war movie. Kiara and Sidhartha's chemistry is something to praise. The VFX of the movie is so properly done that the blast scenes looks so real and the cinematography adds more beauty. I was so invested in the action scenes, the visualization of the movie that I wept out when Vikram was shot dead.There are also few drawbacks in the movie like its predictable, character's fake Punjabi accent and whenever a character talks about going home or his family he dies as it happens in almost all war movies.This movie undoubtedly deserves your time, watch it now on Amazon Prime.",

The film shows one of the highest and most difficult battlefields of the world where there is no cover. In these most adverse conditions, Indian soldiers took the opportunity to display their Supremacy over the geography and the Pakistanis as well.Param Vir Chakra captain Vikram Batra was one such Soldier who came out of a middle class sanatani Hindu family (both parents teachers) and brutally punished the intruders of Pakistan. The film has captured his whole life and the supreme sacrifice that he and his family made for the nation.

The main focus is on the direction which was good but not up to the mark, it felt like they were trying to rush the movie, and also fighting scenes could have been more realistic.Most of the people will not agree with my review but it is what I feel about the movie and I believe the movie could have been better.Finally, one could watch the movie and will come out with no regret in most cases.",

Vikram Batra, his journey of how he became an Army officer, small snipers of his life as told by his brother and family have been put together nicely.At times the story has become a little slow or the love scenes make it slightly boring. But a good acting by Sidarth Malhotra in potraying the charater.But baring that at a few places, it's a good movie to watch.This is actually a Real story in the world of REELS.To sum it up:Shershah is one of the best patriotic Hindi films you should never miss. Its a mix of two love stories. Love story of an army man with a girl from his college and on the other side, love story of an army man and his country.",

Also rather than showing an army officer as a robot always saying Yes Sir and No Sir, this movie showed the life as an army officer, that a soldier too laughs and have friends. This movie had beautiful dialogues and many emotional scenes.In this way, I would give this movie 5 out of 5 stars ...",

So that we can feel that essence more.Kudos to Sidharth and Kiara for taking up such project. It was a huge responsibilty and both did a great job.

His growth as a soldier and role in war\n2. The love story.If you connect with the emotions, not only on the basis of the role played but also with the real life story, you'll feel the Sacrifice done by him and her in their real life and will realize that only the ounce of it is depicted on screen.The representation of various expects of war\nThe acting at most of the time is to the point but Siddharth Malhotra being the lead actor could have done better, at some points he becomes a bit monotonous.

            "content": "This movie shows the passion and love (late) Captain Vikram Batra had for his country. It shows the extent to which a soldier can go to defend his country and to take back his country from his enemies. It shows that a soldier won't back down despite having completed his assignment and months of battle fatigue. It shows how a true leader will risk even his life to save his troops.The movie Shershaah (Captain Batra's codename in Kargil war) is the life-story of Kargil-hero late Captain Vikram Batra, who played a great role in getting back important peaks from pakistani infiltrators/terrorists during kargil war. This is his coming of age story from a happy-go-lucky school boy to a lover, to a passionate soldier to great leader who gave his life to see the tricolour planted on the last barrack on point 4875 during Kargil war.The movie isn't an out-and-out war movie. The movie is over 2 hours and the war really kicks in the last 45 minutes or so, but the movie is engaging throughout nonetheless. In fact there are plenty of action scenes before the war showing how Vikram was crazy and fearless from the get go.The only boring scenes come when Kiara Adwani is on screen as Vikram's love interest. She hams through her entire role as she always does.Siddharth's acting is effortless. In fact, he is the only character who will stay with you weeks to months after you have finished watching it. This is his best performance by a big margin.The movie also does full justice to the war story. It does cut some corners in story and takes some liberties, but otherwise it tries to stick very closely to the real events and dates etc. The action is very realistic too, but something it makes you wonder how Vikram Batra never gets shot even once despite being in line of fire so many times, except until the last scene where he does get fatally wounded.I am giving it 7 stars of 10. The things that could have been improved: The casting (all except Siddharth had better alternatives), music (could have been much better, remember Border?), movie's pacing (could have been cut short by 15-20 minutes by cutting some unnecessary scenes like love-related scenes, childhood scenes (which go on for too long).",

The movie showed the pain the family, friends and love of a martyr goes through when they can't even cry on his death as he deserves much more than tears. The movie has good war visuals, effects and sound. The movie showed the respect a martyr deserves and receives. It shows how a soldier doesn't remember anything at war except the target and victory.It must be probably Sidharth Malhotra best performance. He really played Vikram very well, and he must now be known as Shershah of Bollywood like SRK is known as Baazigar and Mr Bachchan as The Sehanshah.Apart from war movie Kiara Advani and Sidharth showed a great chemistry in this movie. Loved the songs & scenes of your love, the proposal, the first talk, the marriage, the stand-up against dad, the hug, the separation & the final breakdown.

The direction and combat scenes were soooo lame, half of the time director has shown the love story, which I agree is partially important, but was too much to handle. See the direction of Lakshya, Border, Uri the surgical strike, the direction and their actors made us feel soooo incredible, jump on our seats. This movie and this Student of the year failed to do so.... Abhishek Bachan played a better Batra in LOC tbh.",

The character is someone who is a hero of Kargil war and the story approximately matches the incident.Now Sid no doubt did a justice to the character for sure, Vishnuvardhan on the other side did a splendid job to portray the story in such a way that I got engaged to it. Now if I agree that romance could have been a little less in the movie, so how will I justify the tears came out in the end with Mann Bharrya?Lakshya was one of my best movie based on Vikram's valour but Shershaah is the best.Vikram Lived by chance, Loved by choice and Killed by profession so I choose to rate by choice ignoring it's a Dharma prod.

Vikram is a brave and full of energy right from the beginning and doesn't back down from a challenge be it relationships or terrorists. The depiction of army tactics, communication methods were on point. The outfits, gear, weapons being used at that time is very authentic. The visual effects were realistic. But unfortunately that's where it ends.What i didn't like about the film was the narrative style, given that it had been engineered more for a Bollywood loving audience so there were obviously many cliches which I don't want to discuss (One of the lead producers being Karan Johar). The story felt disjointed, almost no connection in first half military conflict with the second half full fledged war. Could have used more background on the Kargil War. The whole environment for war was what i felt was missing the most, since the real bond between army brothers wasn't established properly but rather hastily, which is very important in a war film because it makes the action scenes/casualty scenes more real and visceral. There should have been more screen time to show the actual struggle behind the extremely difficult mountain fight scenes. I understand this is story is based on Vikram Batra and not the Kargil war, but the war is a big part of his story. The ending was very rushed and due to lack of drama and tension, my adrenaline wore off really fast.This movie is a mixed bag for me with a little bit of what i wanted to see and a whole lot of what i didn't want to. Story was really good and would have done wonders if it had used the right creative direction.",

The good thing about this movie is that they tried to be real and not glamourised the story like bollywood do. Rather they have shown how Vikram was as a son, a brother, a lover and a soldier. This movie is not meant for Oscars but for the army and the countrymen. This movie honors Vikram and countless others who give supreme sacrifice for the nation. The combat scenes were fantastic and VFX are damnn good. The songs of the movie touches the soul. The background score is too good. It's dialogues bold yet hits the heart. And tbh the last 15 minutes of the movie were very emotional. I was unable to hold my tears. After seeing this movie, I can proudly say \"yeh dil maange more\".Jai Hind \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3",

Kiara was OK. The rest of the cast members did their job fine to the extend they were given their respective roles Direction and lack of punchy dialogues are the achilis heels of this film. He had to put more emotions and up the suspense and thrill ante. This was my take on Shershaah. Now I know many of Sid Malhotra's fans and probably jingoist minded fans would bombard me with verbal abuses but one thing I want you all to know that I love the movie for a fitting Tribute to Late martyred captain Vikram Batra. No doubt in that. But taking into consideration about the other aspect of this film which is Entertainment-I have to say I am not satisfied fully rather to an extent disappointed.

He was associated to this film from way back 2016 and trained hard to get into the skin of the character. The man deserves every ounce of appreciation he is receiving right now. His 5 years of fruitful prepration has given him the result today.The movie is exceptionally well made and technicially brilliant. The supporting casts show great brotherhood in the army and the film depicts the personal loss when they are martyred is great in all aspects. The vfx, war scenes, combat scenes in Sopore, combat scenes on road are just brilliant.Kiara Advani shines with Sid and adds great layer to the story. They look great together. The love story is all that had really happened between PVC Captian Vikaram and Dimple. She's excellent in emotional scenes and climax nervous breakdown.The movie standouts for it's racy screenplay, to the point story and no meankngless scenes. This movie deserves repeat watching.

The movie steers away from the jingoism, doesn't romanticize the war, but more importantly gives the Brave soldier a tribute he deserves. The VFX doesn't disappoint either. I've seen a lot of negative reviews about the movie, don't fall for that. These type of movies should be celebrated so that the sacrifices of those unsung heroes don't go in vain. It's very cliche thing to say but imagine giving your life for your country, not even thinking for a split second. Takes a brave soul to do that.",

So there was this interview of Dimple Cheema on YouTube i think on The Quint where she shared her love story with late Vikram Batra and i had tears in my eyes and couldn't believe such kind of love still exist. There love was so pure and am sure he loved her with all he has and made her feel so secure that his memories are enough for her to live the rest of her life.Coming to the movie i had least expectation since it was karan johar's movie they ruined some major facts in Gunjan Saxena and i was expecting the same with Shershah. Since, i am already a fan of both (Vikram and Dimple) and convinced myself to give it a try. I was in tears in mid of the movie where he held her duppatta for parikarma. It was exactly the same or even better i have imagined the two of them together. And through the ending what to say I was all in tears. Couldn't believe someone was so sure to be in army, dedicated and sacrificed his life for the country at the age of 24.Its surely siddharth's best performance but also the best acting i have seen after so long. Was so convinced and was so into the movie that made me feel he is real vikram batra. And Kiara with such a small screen time you made an impact, you are perfect Dimple. No one could have done better than you and we all cried with you in the last scene.For me it was 100/10 and its a must must must watch.",

But I wish, he came back, if not for anyone else, for Dimple Cheema and saw her in that wedding outfit and set another rare example of a true love story that was lived. After watching the movie, all I could think of was her, who never got any official recognition, never wanted or sought anything, but has been living the life of another Braveheart quietly for last 20+ years. Her valor may not have been came to light in the battlefields but it certainly shown its true self, in her utter devotion in keeping their love story alive for these many years. Hats off to you Ms. Cheema.",

A beautiful and healtfelt biopic of Late Captain Vikram Batra, martyred in 1999, during the Kargil War. The film totally justifies the character and bravery of the Captain. Also, it brings to light his jolly nature and his love life. Kiara Advani's performance is top notch throughout the film. Though she had a limited screentime yet she managed to bring out all the emotions perfectly. Be it the emotion of longing when he left for his military training or the feeling of grief and sorrow when she waited for years and he came back, wrapped up in tricolour, it made us weep like a baby. The soulful music and Bpraak's notes also deserve a huge applause and appreciation. I can vouch for him that no one else could have done it better. Did I miss anything? Yes, Siddhartha Malhotra's performance! He was ofc at his best. The way he portrayed the life of Captain is beyond praise. Best part is all the dialogues were inspired from real life and it felt so unreal. Yes, true love exists and Dimple is a living example. She's still unmarried and teaches kids. More power to her.

Remember before watching that it is more a biographical than a war movie so pls don't compare it with \"URI\" or \"Border\". The film it can be compared with is \"Lakshya\" as a journey of a common kid from small town to become a legend.The Goods\nExcellent directionRealistic approach. Simplicity is in its core.Siddharth Malhotra will be remembered for this film for long time to come. Other casts are good and does justice.Cinematography is breathtaking specially the war scenes.Background music is good. The music(songs) are fillers but does not hinder the story.A proper homage to the martyrs of Kargil War and their sacrifices-\nThe Bad\nAs i had feared in the movie the dare devilry of Capt Vikram Batra was far more heroic than portrayed here. Maybe the director thought that if they follow the details it will make the viewers not believe in the story.It seems that the movie was forced to be kept around 2 hrs run time. A little more run time would had been better.A bit more details on the operations of peak 5140 and 4875 would have enhanced the viewers understanding of heroism of PVC Capt Vikram Batra.A bit more insight of Kargil war was required.Having said that \"Shershaah\" is the movie for large screens and OTT platform doesnot do justice.",

            "content": "After viewing the first initial trailers, I was overwhelmingly excited for this biopic. However, at the same time, I realized that Bollywood is exceedingly inconsistent with quality. For example, in an industry where exceptional films like Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and Uri are created, underwhelming projects like Radhe and Coolie no. 1 are also produced. Fortunately for the industry, Shershaah is masterclass of storytelling, which expertly highlights the life of the late Captain Vikram Batra. Moreover, the film has been keenly edited in a manner that never allows it to drag or appear self-indulgent. Furthermore, the cinematography by Kamaljeet Negi shines in illuminating the grim war scenes, which are extraordinarily created by Red Chilies VFX. The VFX were another concern I had for the film since most Indian films lack in this department; however, Shershaah delivers on this end as well. Overall, with remarkable directing, editing, cinematography, and performances by the cast, this film has emerged as the finest Hindi film of the new decade. Sidharth's performance alone is enough to warrant this a watch. 10/10 Masterpiece.",

This movie allows him to potray an enthusiastic person is what i would say he has somewhat justified the role but i believe he could had done a little better.I really feel having a snack in between a war torn location where there are bullets being fired was silly to even predict. Secondly, no engineers are allowed to enter the enemy territory for the sake of re-capturing our lost peak. It was as silly as showing Kulbhushan Karbanda in border who was a cook picking up a gun in an hour of need. Similarly i felt there were many such instances.",

Many people in the reviews have said that they liked Siddharth's acting, but I found it as pathetic as in his previous movies.2. One thing that bugged me a lot was, over 80% of the enemy soldiers were killed by protagonist, which is slightly unrealistic.3. Another complaint that I have with bollywood movies, Why does every movie has a female supporting actress whose only role in the movie is to be a love interest of the protagonist. Why a movie about war can't be just about war.4.

It is a \"Typical KJ movie\"",

Close to reality with a very minimal amount of fiction.Secondly the cast of the film. It's worth an applause. Everyone play their part so well. Not a single frame exists where you feel it is going ott. Not just Siddharth and Kiara but others as well. All the supporting characters also make a mark.Thirdly the album of this film. Every song is new. No remakes. Tunes are catchy. Originality clicks. Also they come into the movie at an appropriate situation making their mark. The Mann Bharraya sequence hits at the right note and unexpectedly. Every song is amazing and stays in your mind.The direction of the film is noteworthy. Every shot that is captured shows the vision of the director and his demand for that perfect shot. The amount of hard work put in and the vision of the director is very clear. The thought process of showing a particular thing in a particular manner is visible and is an evident factor why the final cut has come out so well.The next part, the cinematography of this film is so beautiful. The locations and shots make it so appealing to your eyes.Coming to the action sequences which are bang on. Choreographed well and filmed brilliantly. All are portrayed in a realistic manner and make you feel as if you are just present there in the moment and witnessing them live.The best part is the VFX. VFX made the film more attractive in a way that no where you feel it is caricaturish. Doesn't look dramatic at all.The dialogues are the most important ingredients in the film. They are written so well. Connecting aptly with the audience and making you feel as if they are being communicated to you.The screenplay is flowing in a beautiful manner. Every back and forth switch between the war and flashes from the past are in a perfect sync.Shershaah is a must watch for every movie lover since it has an element of everything you would love to see in a film apart from the fact that this was actually a real story and Capt. Vikram Batra had actually lived this life with his family, friends, colleagues and Dimple ofcourse.It has the perfect balance and blend of romance, emotions, patriotism, comedy, etc. And the best thing being no emotion or portrayal overpowers the other or takes over the other. They are all in proportion.Definitely a 10 rating film.",

Whenever you are making a biopic of a real life hero, it not necessary to make it crispy or more dramatic as if it is a fictional story. The script should be written in a way that a viewer gets more information about the main character on whose life the movie is being made and his/her surroundings. This whole movie is made to make to make the audience emotional, sentimental by the songs. How you can say that a movie is masterpiece biopic when the makers are getting cuss words out of main lead's mouth (Sidharth Malhotra as Captain Vikram Batra). Does these kind of scenes really make a real life hero a hero as he was is real life.About the acting:\nSidharth Malhotra's acting was not good enough as it was required but Kiara Advani's performance was somehow good. The actors were really poor at speaking Punjabi. Vikram Batra, on whose life the movie is about, was a Punjabi and Sidharth Malhotra who portrayed his character didn't even had the basic accent to speak Punjabi on screen. The actors could have done some workshop on this matter. The supporting actors (Shiv Panditt, Sahil Vaid, Nikitin Dheer, Mir Sarwar, Raj Arjun etc) were good at their work.About the VFX:\nThe VFX was not really a great thing in this particular movie. Some scenes were good in terms of VFX but some were really a disaster. Can't say anything much about the VFX since it was just normal (not looking too real).

I don't watch much of Bollywood now, like for last two years, but couldn't resist watching it full. I am not going to compare to Hollywood, which I watch lot more, but that doesn't mean it's not comparable. Get this straight, this movie is great and will not give you a moment where you feel like, 'I should stop now'.Overall, liked it quite a lot. Now will show my parents too.Oh, by the way I too didn't expect that it was a Dharma Productions, got to know only after watching it.And many people who feel like it is the worst movie for various reasons, it's okay. But some went too far saying that they don't know how can Indian audience not see or do justice to the movie and are trying to make it super duper hit. Hear it from me, straight, 'Mind your language, and maintain the limits'. You're not our representative, first and second that you are no-one to ask such a dumb question. Everyone has different taste, and they can like to see different things from different point.Anyways, glad I found this movie through my brother on Prime Videos.And thanks to everyone who has taken part in its creation.

In fact if you take Vikram Batra's name out of the movie, the whole weightage drops. I still haven't figured out why 'Bharat mata ki jai' didn't roar in the movie when the movie is actually all about that. At lot of places, its made to look like there is no strategy required to attack, seniors' orders can be optionally complied with, I'm sure Indian army is much more about rules than that. It felt like a movie to develop Sidharth's fan following as an actor by playing nation sentiment similar to what we have seen in the past.",

Vikram Batra, the work that he has put in, and you can obviously see the outcome. If you weren't a fan already, after watching this, you sure will be.Kiara Advani was fantastic in her role as well, along with the other cast members. As the film proceeds, the writers and the director ensure to focus on each character, which makes you feel for them at various points in the film.As I said before, the film ticks all the boxes, right from the element of war and action, to the element of love, the background score and the music, the cinematography, everything is just right in this film. Brilliantly led from the front by the director, Vishnuvardhan. Overall, the film is fast-paced, plus you're invested in it right from the beginning, I couldn't find nor think of any flaws that would make the film less lovable.Shershaah is perfect. An exemplary example of a well-made war film, a Hindi film, a Siddharth Malhotra film. This film just took my breath away, so much so that even after 24 hours the film has definitely stayed with me and made a mark too. Couldn't recommend it enough.",

That was stupid execution only because the history states that Vikram becomes a martyr in the Kargil war . Show that his team tried to save him at least and not dance infront of him.In another scene, Vikram started running infront of the Pakistani bunkers to save his army man. He holds his injured friend, pulls him to safety, all while the Pakistanis continuously fire at both of them and no bullet hits them even when they are in direct range of 10s of Ak47s. That scene's execution also could've been done better.Lastly, Being a Punjabi Kiara's Punjabi hurt my ears. Apart from these three points, I liked the film, Vikram Batra's life story, Sidharth's acting, war scene, VFX, music, romance and no over the top dialogues or slow motion scenes like in Bhuj.",

            "review_title": "From REAL to REEL",
            "content": "There are only 2 reasons for writing this review. One - being a fellow technician in the film industry from another language (Kannada), the value & significance of how making a movie equaling a penance is not lost on me and the other - an acute lack of \"film appreciation\" by even the most mainstream reviewers.Not being one to watch movies based on reviews (where on the other hand, most people seem to form their opinions based on one and even decide whether to watch or not), I do go through them after in a bid to identify if grasping something was missed during my watch (the first watch is always to \"feel the movie\" and soak up the experience however, I do watch them again in case of compelling instances). The reviews by a few so-called mainstream reviewers seemed unduly harsh warranting this write-up.Let me try taking on a couple of common gripes from the scribes about SHERSHAAH.1. \"Too similar to many other war movies\"If a cricketers' biopic is made, it would be like saying \"the cricketing aspects are too similar to ones found in other cricketers' biopic\"!First things first, this is not a war movie. This is a BIOPIC and with the person being from the armed forces, war is a given. So, the backdrop is the most distinguished achievement of this individual, which was the Kargil war. As such, there is no getting away from the war zone. After all, the man is a martyr and at a tender age of 24 - when, most of us would still be trying to figure out how not to screw up our life!Technically, the film is very immersive during the war scenes. The locations, action, VFX and most importantly, the on-ground procedures followed are very impressive to say the least. Standing apart are the tactical gestures depicted, which clearly indicate that they have been thoroughly researched/consulted with. Such aspects are usually a casualty in the name of \"cinematic liberty\" as found in many other \"so-called films made in India that are based on the armed forces or even the police\". As such, a definite credit where it is due for sure.It is the camera work, editing and sound design that really takes one inside these scenes. Personally, for me, the RR (re-recording (mainly the BGM) was a mixed bag though.2. \"The love story track\"Yes, that is supposed to be an integral part of this movie since, the aim is to celebrate the man called Captain Vikram Batra. He is not a fictional character and hence, if he is shown sporting a smile, a bit of hair style, mannerism and a bit of persona that seems to mimic a certain Shar Rukh Khan then, that is reflective of the times he grew up in. If the on-screen love story seems to plain could the real life story be blamed for it? It need not be omitted for, that was the essence which kept the then adolescent chap's heart beating while safeguarding the nation's borders. Thankfully & correctly, things haven't been blown out of proportion to make it a \"filmy romance\".Coming to the good bits, a run time of 2 hours is a major plus. Also, the deliberate avoiding of \"high pitched jingoism/Pak-bashing\" by the makers is a relief too. There was a time when \"Doodh maangogey toh kheer dengey, Kashmir maangogae toh cheer dengey\" resonated with the audience however, an approach of dignified depiction works in favor of the movie here.Clear vision regarding the purpose of the movie is a good indication of the abilities/skills/craft of it's director. This clarity establishes that the most important language that a director should be aware of are the nitty-gritties of story telling. The makers need to be lauded for staying true to it through this effort.The point of cinema appreciation becomes relevant in such scenarios because, as viewers (general audience & reviewers alike), movies need to be watched for what they are and not what one \"wants them to be\". Yes, a reviewer can surely be constructive to indicate \"what could have been\" but surely not lose sight of what the movie is intended to be about in the first place. In that sense, SHERSHAAH is certainly an endeavor to authentically capture incidences visually that are documented in public domain with a mix of real life instances (which may not necessarily be too exciting). Being a biopic, it suffices if the family has found the movie to be graceful in saluting a martyr and true son of the nation. Together, we can all proudly say \"Durge maata ki jai\"!",

Role who is going for very important mission, for which they have given code name, talk to malhotra's character by calling him his name.Dying of Anil charanjeett character is so pointless and emotionless. He's an army naib subedar, a trained soldier, not a kid walking on street.Nowhere in movie they show big brother of malhotra's character who is telling itty-bitty thing of malhotra's character life, without being there.Switching punjabi to hindi whenever a important/complex dialogue delivering and then move again to punjabi when its over.Not feels like malhotra's character is from Himachal, feels like from amritsar.No point putting army canteen scene where malhotra's character buying liquor.

Sounds and visuals beautifully composed to immerse the viewer into the environment.The dialogues were perfectly written to blend into the character of Captain Batra. One of the things I've noticed was Siddharth shaking his feet into a rhythemic, restless tapping- a trait of Captain Batra which Dimple Cheema described in an interview, the reluctance to sit idle, to tap the table with his hands and when told not to, tapping his feet.If someone is here for the love story, it is cute and nothing overblown. It plays an integral part towards the core plot and again doesn't feel out of place or forced into the plot.",

Cinematographer Kamaljeet Negi's camera captures the urgency and tension, a lot of scenes shot in dim lit frames convey how hostile the conditions are. These are parts that grip us, some we can't help but see with moist eyes. It's commendable that the tone remains steady and never loud and jingoistic.Best part is the climax with a surprise song!That, to a certain extent, is how the film is. Just a little more cinematic firepower and flint might have taken Shershaah much higher - and further - as a war drama.",

Each and every thing was so nicely potrayed must say wooooow....the mix emotion and love. It shows 2 love stories one for a girl and other for the country as an Indian Army. As it was a biopic movie; they showed different side of Captain Vikram Batra's sir personality which made us love him more n more.Really give an appreciation to Siddhartha Mohlotra for his best career performance and hardwork has seen in the movie. As he is one of my fav. Actor i'm really got surprised and happy for his unlocked next level in his acting.Kiara Advani also done a great job. She potrayed the character of his gf to perfection as supporting his faugi bf.Director has well presented the movie without the unnecessary gruesome of patriotism, he made it simple,plain and realistic.

At beginning of the film it seemed even this one was just an other such films focussing patriotism, but just as you commence forward you'll get a very huge perspective of a army person and making war isn't the best result of victory. War costs many brave lives and and no one chooses to loose their one and only life for the sake of nonviolence, so this movie has done a great job portraying the consequences of real life war and the immense loss of a family member and the cast of course have given their maximum to enact the actual person.

Vikram Batra, PVC. His acting, spirit was highly appreciable for sure. There was that spark, that tenacity, that spirit.Kiara was also very appropriate in terms of depicting Dimple ma'am.Their chemistry was so good overall.The BG scores of the movie were amazing.Hats off to B Praak and Jasleen for such beautiful\nsountracks and such soothing melody.VFX were quite good too.

Moving upon the cast Siddharth Malhotra has done justice with the character... Kiara also has done her job amezingly.....

Vikram Batra's personality which made us love him more. He had a filmy, sweet lover in him too. The whole movie was a mix of so much emotions. Everything looked really authentic and good amount of detailing was put on the making of movie..Thanks to the maker of this movie to bring us heroics of our own Captain INDIA... PVC Vikaram Batra..\nThis story has to be told.... This story has to be remembered..\nTo be 24 and show such courage is something unparalleled.. I am not sure and can,t what inspires an human being to do so for his own country...Thsi has something to do with the upbringing definately... salute to the parents and the family..\ud83d\ude4fStarting from the promotional JaiHind ki Senaa; all the songs including Raatan lambiyan and Raanjha was masterpieces.Sidharth Malhotra! He lived the character. Totally nailed it. Each and every emotion was nicely potrayed. He deserves a national award for this performance.Surely his best performance so far. So proud of this man! All the hardwork he has put in is seen in the movie itself.. He truly has out done himself in this. He has such a charming personality which makes him pefect person to potray this role which needs a out of the top charm.Sid-kiara chemistry felt almost real and had a rare pureness which enhanced the bond between dimple and vikram.Kiara Advani did a great job.If Sidharth was the soul of the movie; Kiara was the heart of the movie.Other supporting actors were on point..Niketan Dheer specially has good moments in the movie.Get ready for all the love and lots of love..\nIf this was released in theatres, this could've been EPIC! But yet this a truly is a blockbuster movie. A must watch! And thss will make you feel the value of a soldier's so many twist and turns come in their ..\nJust fabulous\n\u2b50\ud83c\udf1f\u2b50\ud83c\udf1f\u2b50",

Kiara and Sid were too good, their story was so pure and true and I really liked how they have kept the movie so real... Sid when asking his team to fight and was telling plan it was real, as during war no one will have those filmy dialogues and that's what this movie depicted.

The story line flows, the intro, the love story is beautiful, the casting is perfect (particularly Sid and kiara). The ending I was balling my eyes out, I because so emotionally attached. Also they didn't the whole Pakistan is bad which a lot of films do, I liked this because the was supposed to be about Vikram Batra and his love for India.

I already knew about the Kargil War with Capt Batra and his brotherly soldiers alongside, about their brave sacrifices and victory by our fathers and their fraternity. But still, Capt Batra's traits and charisma as we had learnt was excellently pulled off by Siddharth Malhotra to the maximum extent! The style, the Charisma, from a romantic filmy flair to this exceptionally brave fauji! Everything seemed so original! There was no too much fauji-giri or too much of romance. Everything on point. The action sequences, ambush scenes, defence/firing formations and ways too good. Other soldiers and officers of the battalion were also played very well! Great display of similarities. Dimple, uff, her innocence, originality, simplicity just everything made us fall for her. Dimple Cheema aka Mrs Batra is our unsung hero! Kiara was absolutely the best! The songs, damn. You still can't get over them. Right choice of the singer and music! The very fact that 99% of this movie is totally true makes us all cry and praise at the same time. I can bet you, if you can't survive last 20mins of the film without tearing up or goosebumps with a heavy heart.The best part I felt was, the makers really should be appreciated as they honoured the battalion's officers and soldiers who were a part of the war too!Just felt that the scenes especially the funeral ones, the ones with dimple or while Capt Batra watching the tricolour unfurled, could be a bit longer so as to give us a lil extra time to cope up with it allAll in all, this was one of the greatest, best, heart-touching films till date, I bet you won't be able to get over it so soon\nFrom a fauji kid to you- always appreciate and remember what the soldiers sacrifice for you! It's just 1 film but narrates a thousand legacies of a thousand soldiers from our country.",

Sidharth did a terrific job as Capt. Vikram Batra. He carried himself extremely well and delivered a mighty impressive performance. The soundtrack was beautiful, with a few songs leaving you looking for tissues. The direction, of course, was fantastic. Some scenes left me crying and with goosebumps. That's just how good everything was. Kiara did a great job too. Towards the end of the movie, her performance is guaranteed to make you cry. The movie, as a whole, arouses a great feeling of patriotism in one's heart, besides taking you through heart-wrenching pain of the families of those valiant soldiers who proudly lay down their lives for the country, without so much as batting an eyelid. All in all, this movie is a must-watch. 10/10 go for it!",

The scenery at Kashmir was so beautiful. Siddharth Malhotra really outdid himself and he lived as Vikram Batra Sir. What a natural actor he is. Been watching him since SOTY and he just keeps on amazing me. Kiara was so simple yet elegant and portrayed Dimple Cheema the best. Director VishnuVardhan once again made all of us so proud. I was amazed when I get to know he's the director because the movie didn't had any South Indian touch it was as if some Bollywood Director directed the movie. Amazing job from the entire cast and crew. So good to see Shiv Panditt as well. Been watching him since Leelai Movie and he too really outdid himself. For me 10 Stars are just not enough to express how much I love this movie. Songs are just soul soothing that I'm listening to them on loop. Yeh Dil Maange More.",

The 'SHERSHAAH' movie fabricated under the direction of Vishnuvardhan was released on 12th August, 2021 at the OTT platform of Amazon Prime Video in which the main cast of Captain Vikram Batra played by the very versatile actor Siddharth Malhotra.Vikram batra (9 September 1974 - 7 July 1999) was born in a middle class family of Palampur, a small district of Himachal Pradesh. From his childhood Vikram had the ambition to join the Indian Army. His love for Indian Army inspired him from a serial Paramvir Chakra which telecasted on Doordashahan and this reverence transfigured into a passion. He met with Dimple Cheema( role played by Kiara Advani , lead actress of film) in college and their love story transformed from friendship to marriage. Then he joined India army at the age of 23 after completing the training of one and half years at IMA as a lieutenant in 13 Jammu and Kashmir Rifles.This person's stubbornness to do something for the country and the definition of love in a right way has been showed to audience by the film Shershaah. From nonage, Vikram was always set to fight and take risks for his rights and this type of attitude aided him and Indian army in the Kargil War and in search operation of Kasmiri terrorist, Haider. He had a congenial behavior to his fellow soldiers and Kashmiris and this made him successful in completing many missions. The best thing about this movie for today's youth generation is when the Vikram decides to sacrifice his dream to join Indian Army for his love and then his friend, Sunny (role played by Sahil Vaid) told him the very right thing, \"jab koi dusra banda aake sapna todta h na too banda sambhal jata h koi problem nhi hoti.........aur jab khud tu saare sapne todega na apne to aadmi mar jata h\" and this words is for those teenagers who do anything for their love and don't know the wack consequences of it. Dimple Cheema said, \"How do I describe a lifetime of memories, though made only in four years of association? I could go on and on, and the memories would still keep coming Not a single day in the past 17 years have I felt detached from you. It feels as if you are away on a posting. I know in my heart that we are going to meet again, it's just a matter of time\" and that is the definition of love in real life in which you sacrifice everything for your partner but in a right way which have nothing bad impact on both.Siddharth Malhohtra acted all the dispositions of Vikram Batra in a very realistic way and he suited in this character very much. Shershaah was the name given to Captain Vikram for secret talk in Kargil War and that'why this film was named as SHERSHAAH. This film is a salute to that country lover who called \"ye dil maange mor \" as a victory sign which means he wanted to get these all enemies out of country, this is a salute to a soldier who is ready to lay down for Mother India at all times.I request you to watch this movie once and whoever has the slightest desire to do something for his country take inspiration and courage from the life of Param Veer Chakra awarded Captain Vikram Batra.",

It skips and lurches (not referring to going back and forth chronologically).I am giving it a 6, perhaps my standards are a little high, but I guess I would overall 6-7.

It is fantastic, like I cannot really put it into words.The beauty, the pain, the laughter, the sorrow, the love, the leadership, and many other things are amazingly depicted in this one movie.I have been a great fan of Sidharth Malhotra since he starred in Student of The Year and I always always find him charming and talented. But in THIS MOVIE? Damn, Sidharth, you cannot be more spectacular. You are not acting in this movie, you are living it, and it is as if you are the Vikram Batra himself.Man, the highest appreciation for you. I have no idea about Indian history as I am Indonesian, but watching this, I feel myself as the part of the whole history. Gosh, Sid, how come this is happening. IT IS AMAZING. I wish the vote didn't stop at 10, I and so many people could give you MORE than a 10 in vote.This is my very very first time writing a review on a movie THIS LONG, let alone writing on IMDb.Sid, I wish I could meet you in person and tell you this.And Kiara, madam, what a performance. This is the first movie of you that I watch and you have captured my whole heart. THANK YOU for doing it so so so beuatifully. We couldnt ask for more. So blessed to see you here in this movie with Sid.My sincere thankful to the director and writer and Vikram Batra's family who has allowed Vikram Batra's stories to be published as beautifully as this. Like I cannot thank you all enough.Man, I have so many words, but I know this review could not even catch people's eyes, but I just wanna pour my feelings after watching this movie.THANK YOU!",

Mentally and emotionally, it teaches you something or inspires you.Shershaah is one of those movies. Never have I ever felt a surge of patriotism in me. I think last patriotic movie which all of us remember is Uri: the surgical strike.Shershaah is totally realistic and original. I thought some of the plots might have been taken from Uri, but I was wrong. This movie is very original in itself.The one thing which I really loved about it is that it not only shows the brave and audacious side of a soldier but also the human side of him.The location, the storyline, the casting, the songs, the way the movie flows and holds its audience till the very end, is just brilliant!!The cast has also played their roles very beautifully. Sidharth Malhotra, though an underrated actor in Bollywood has done a great job! And the way he has performed shows that he really did put in his sweat and blood to bring out the true character of Captain Vikram Batra. Even, Kiara Advani has played the role very beautifully. I can't even imagine anyone else playing the role of Dimple Cheema other than Kiara.Over all a great masterpiece!!",

All the songs are so beautiful and full of emotions. You feel all the lyrics and you get every feeling, whether it be love or courage or admiration, and it's amazing! Absolutely amazing! The music and their acting makes it seem as if you lived every moment with the characters and that shows just how authentic it is. Both lead actors have nailed it with their characters. They couldn't have chosen a better actor for Captain Vikram Batra's role, as Sidharth Malhotra portrays it perfectly with both his dialogues and the mannerisms. Kiara Advani has also done a wonderful performance in this movie as lead actress and I hope to see more of Sidharth and Kiara's chemistry on screen.And of course, Salute to the real Captain Vikram Batra and his real-life story that is being brought to the big screen. This is such an inspiring story full of courage and bravery and will certainly stay with me for the rest of my life.This is the best movie I have ever watched and this film will always have a special place in my heart. Hats off to Director Vishnu Varadhan, Writer Sandeep Shrivastava, Producer Karan Johar, and all others who have contributed to the making of this film. No amount of words can fully express how I feel about this film but I hope this sums it up well. Please go and watch this amazing masterpiece if you haven't already and show your love for India. You won't be disappointed!",

The last scene when she cries seeing last rites of Vikram Batra is extremely touching. Most importantly the movie is not just about KARGIL. Its actually about Vikram Batra's journey. Some people may say that first half is slow but that pace was necessary to build his character especially, portraying how he turned from a civilian to a lieutenant to a captain to a martyr. The best part of movie is that its not at all masala movie. Its actually a realistic as well as emotional movie.",

            "review_title": "An Amazing Patriotic Film",
            "content": "Film Review of ShershahThe first thing that springs to mind as Shershaah unfolds is this: a war hero deserved a far more engaging and energetic film. It is a suitably solemn, restrained account of the brief life and career of a 25-year-old Army Captain who died fighting in the 1999 Kargil war, but it takes inordinately long to get anywhere near full throttle. Shershah is a biopic movie dedicated on the life of the brave Indian soldier Late Captain Vikram Batra, an inspiring war drama of bravehearts and victories. It is one of the best war realistic films ever made in Bollywood. The film was released on 12th August 2021 on the OTT Platform Amazon Prime. The film consisted of Siddharth Malhotra as Captain Vikram Batra, Kiara Advani as Dimple Kapadia, Ankita Goraya as Nutan Batra, Raj Arun as Subhedar Raghunath Singh, Shiv Pandit as Army captain etc. The 2hrs 15 minute film was directed by Vishnuvardhan, Produced by Dharma Productions Karan Johar.Talking of the story, The Kargil conflict - the toughest mountain warfare ever. Fought at a dizzying altitude of 17,000 feet, this historic war had a lot at stake. The Pakistani troops had infiltrated into the Indian side of the LoC, disguised as Kashmiri militants. The skirmishes quickly escalated into a full-blown war that also chalked the journey of a soldier from Lieutenant to Captain for his absolute dare-devilry and patriotic spirit to unfurl the tricolour at the highest point of conflict. Even if that meant laying down his own life for the cause. But before we get there, director Vishnu Varadhan and his writer Sandeep Srivastava take it slow. So we are taken right back to a childhood sequence of Captain Vikram Batra (Sidharth Malhotra) and shown his growing up years, finding the love of his life Dimple Cheema (Kiara Advani), before he is finally posted at the 13 JAK Rifles as a Lieutenant. I won't be revealing the full story to spoil your mood.The film was a total justice to an army man's life. The film showed how the army is committed for the safety of Kashmir people, countering the terrorists, gathering inputs, the coordination, teamwork and how brave our army men are. Film was mainly shot in Kashmir and I was stunned by the way the film was shot and edited, especially the gun scenes and the way it was shot at high altitudes. It was incredible. The songs of these movies were so soothing and lovely that I can't express my words. Raataan Lambiyan by Jubin Nautiyal and Ranjha by B Praak were so good that it became an instant hit while Instagram was flooded with reels of these 2 songs. The film even had a touch of romance of Siddarth Malhotra and Kiara Advani for which bollywood is famous. I felt personally that the way Siddharth Malhotra acted in this biopic was truly the best. The way he delivered the dialogues like \"Dil Mange More,\" \"Live by chance, love by choice and kill by profession\" were epic.The film's overall tone is obviously high on patriotism. Many combat scenes don't reflect the large canvas that the film is set up on, perhaps more deserving of a big screen experience. Yet, as an industry, Bollywood has seldom churned out epic war films that have been critically and commercially acclaimed. By those standards, 'Shershaah' ranks higher than most of the recent war dramas and tells an inspiring story that needs to be told.The source material of this film is so strong that it is bound to grip you once the men in uniform take it upon themselves to drive out the enemy and reclaim our land. 'Shershaah's biggest victory is its effort to recreate one of the most important chapters of our recent history with characters, who lead the way to a rousing climax. For me this film is a 5 on 5.",

The movie is all about Shershaah. He has simplicity, and obviously he is emotional. I can't describe how Siddharth Malhotra has portrayed the Shershaah. He is definitely up to the mark. May be no one can do this character so very much good as Sidharth. So as Kiara. Vikram's father was too good in his part. Overall its a complete package. I didn't get bored when I had watched the war,mission scene. It was very much powerful and realistic.",

His contribution was significant in allowing India to win the war. The film ends with pictures and videos of the real heroes of this story.This film was superbly acted by all, in particular Sidharth came across very sincere and I felt he connected with his character very well.

I had only one question, that would it be able to surpass the near perfect standard set by Lakshya, who inspired thousands to join Army. The first scene of the movie itself reminded me of lakshya. Starting from the kargil, the movie went to college days. The movie progressed almost like lakshya. The movie didn't lost it's momentum at any point. The battle scenes and Army discipline was what I missed in the movie. Sidharth did good but was bit dull in comparison to Hritik in lakshya and even to vicky kaushal of Uri. The background score was also not so inspiring. The casting director also didn't gave importance to the actors for supporting cast and had an average supporting cast. But one thing I liked more in this movie, I.e., Army is not only about officers, it's also about jawan and the director showed it.Overall, I will say it's a watchable movie which is all about gunfire but nowhere near Lakshya, a masterpiece.",

In the last scene it is going to make people cry. Only two issues I find. Firstly the punjabi spoken by actors was out of place. I'm not a punjabi but i could see how they were not native punjabi speaker. It would be better to stick with hindi then using ithe uthe kithe tauda. Second is last song didn't match the moment.

Many were complaining about love angle of this movie from trailer and that shows the lack of research done by the audiences about our great hero Cpt. Vikram Batra. This movie is first biopic and war genre. And Capt. Batra 's romantic life is essential part of it, so it will obviously be there. Coming to the movie Sidharth Malhotra was extremely promising as Capt. Vikram Batra which shows that he obviously has more than his looks . This is his turning point of carrier and I hope he chooses more out of zone characters to play. Kiara Advani was also promising. The thing were she lacked for me was her punjabi accent and fluency. It was good but not as promising as I was expecting it to be. But overall she was great too. This movie has some interesting cast choices and I liked it. Actors were quiet similar looking to its real life person which was good they all did there jobs well. Another thing I liked about this movie is its sound design. Sound designers did great job. Vfx were also nice. Thing that impressed me about vfx was muzzle effect and grenade. Vfx guys have done there research. Literally most Indian movies have got these things wrong. Fight choreography was also nice. Only place were it got fucked was in fight scene with haider those puches really looked fake. That was the one of the little faults that I found in this movie. Overall great film definitely must watch. Hands-off to all actors and crew members for making this great film.",
