I worry about the dude. Then Frank Grillo, happenstance makes that I have seen three of his films this week, I was just saying how I wish he would get a break. Not for this film! Note that he is billed first, above Willis, and his role is at most 15 minutes from the film anyway.But what makes this film shine like a black hole is the story. It felt more than devoid of passion, like a spreadsheet that sucks one's soul away in the accounting department on a hot day after the air conditioning died. I mean, if a kid would have written it, it at least would have been fun. If someone was incompetent it would have felt like trying to send some kind of message, however badly. But no, it ... just made no sense, like someone hated writing for this film.Bottom line: it is so bad you can't even enjoy it wasted. It's a non-movie. It's like what's on the other side of the event horizon of TV static.",

            "content": "First,I adore sci-fi. And am willing to overlook A LOT. But this piece of.... What the heck where they thinking. The writing and scenes/environment are so sooo bad its just too distracting. I still (skipped after a point) to the end but this is one of the worst sci-fi movies I have EVER seen.\nThis is supposed to be happening in 2500s . And sci-fi is usually written by guys/gals who like the genre right? So you'd assume they're not dumb, this is genre for tech/gadget/future visions loving people/thinkers.\nFirst of all, its all happening in a city like today. Petrol cars, grunge plaid shirts wearing, beer drinking dudes everywhere and every single piece of the environment they are in is from like 2005. NOTHING is advanced anywhere except a CGI spaceship here and there. Everyone still uses regular guns with bullets propelled by gun powder and use petrol. They still use incandecent lightbulbs. Even we in Europe dont use them anymore, they dont even sell them anymore by law. TODAY.Or landing with a spaceship on a foreign planet and then they pitch up A TENT. A TENT!!! In 2500s and not a fancy,sci-fi redesigned/decorated for the movie to look special, hi-tech tent. Nah-ha. An obviously locally bought, regular, simple tent with old regular folding chairs and tables. They didnt even try to make anything look advanced.Also everything from clothing,storage boxes, various military tools, every piece of housing is from 2000s. You might think (for a milisecond), how about Firefly, combo of Wild West and space. Not even close,that beautiful show was an intelligent combination,smartly done,with foundations explaining everything. Insulting to even be considered in regards to this disaster.The story. Lets not even get there. The (IMO) very interesting plot summary that draws your interest to watch it is 100% misleading.\nIts so boring and slow it stops drawing your interest after 15 minutes. In then end its just confusing and silly. Never mind again, that so so many things just dont make sense or are ignored.\nI do not know how such a thing can get approved. It is so bad. And Bruce. What the heck. De Niro at least sold his soul for comedies that work in 50%. But Bruce lately... this movie isnt worth the few cents of material that the medium it is recorded on. Dont watch.",

            "content": "I noticed that \"Cosmic Sin\" recently made it to IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list and has a pitiful score of only 2.5! So, not only is it on the list...but it is way up the list at #39!When I first started watching this sci-fi film, I could IMMEDIATELY see why the film is so hated. It's a film set in the 26th century and at this time, there is space travel and life on many planets and moons. So, why do you see folks driving pickup trucks that look like they are from 2021? Why are the clothes pretty much what you'd see today and why are most of the weapons not much more effective or different than today's?! It honestly looks like they must have spend all their budget on securing Bruce Willis' talents and had nothing left to make it look like a futuristic story. Now I don't think you need expensive props to make a good film...but this is ridiculous and really takes you out of the story.The story begins with some form of life being discovered on some new planet. It seems that up until this time, humans have never made first contact with any intelligent species...even with humans inhabiting many new worlds. As you'd expect, this new form of sentient life is not sweet and friendly....as who would want to see a film like that?! And, it turns out that it is so deadly that in the entire galaxy (numbering many, many, many billions) the only guy that can stop the creatures is a war criminal, James Ford (Willis)!I have seen much worse films that never made it to the IMDB list...mostly because they are older, cheaper and more obscure. In other words, the Bottom 100 is very heavily skewed to new films...so although the film is bad, it's not the 39th worst film ever made! I think it's just that a lot of folks get Netflix and had a chance to see it...whereas far less folks have seen the films of Ed Wood, Al Adamson, Ray Dennis Steckler and William Grefe...all filmmakers who REALLY knew how to make terrible films...REALLY terrible films!So is there anything good about this movie? Some of the CGI space scenes are very nice and would probably look great on the big screen (though I assume this film, when it came out, only went straight to Netflix and Amazon Prime). Otherwise, the story is not especially interesting, the dialog often pretty bad and the acting not especially good. It is not completely awful...just mostly awful. And, unfortunately not so bad that it's fun to watch in order to make fun of the film.By the way, nearly all the reviews for this are extremely negative. With this and a score of 2.5, I am amazed to find some folks giving it 10s! A few admit that it's bad but are just trolling or love it because it's so bad. A few, however, are VERY short reviews that talk about how brilliant it is...a sure sign normally of fake reviews done by folks connected with the film...which is pretty shameful.",

An alien presence infects people and turns them into marauding zombies. James Ford (Bruce Willis) is a disgraced military leader arguing for the doomsday Q-bomb. Engineer Fiona Ardene (Adelaide Kane) is called in to prep the device. General Ryle (Frank Grillo) leads the soldiers while Dr. Lea Goss (Perrey Reeves) is awed by the aliens.First thing first, this movie opens with an info-dump in text form. It's a lot of gobbledygook. Someone should try to read it again. Then there is the awkward mix of present-day technology with the future tech. There is no logical reason for it. It's an obviously sign of bad budgeting and unimaginative set design. When that happens, they are better off putting the movie in a smaller space and as much future tech onto the screen. At least, put some effort in giving the characters some future-cars. Its greater sin is that it's boring. I think I must have spaced out. One moment, they're fighting zombies in the warehouse and the next, they're space-diving to another planet. It's a forgettable muddle.",

            "content": "Granted, I have to admit that I was lured in to watching the 2021 movie \"Cosmic Sin\" given the movie's cover/poster and the fact that the movie was starring Bruce Willis, Frank Grillo and Costas Mandylor.And let me just come right out and say that writers Edward Drake and Corey Large failed to deliver a wholesome movie here with \"Cosmic Sin\". While I managed to sit through the entire ordeal, then I must say that all throughout the course of the entire movie I was sitting with an overwhelming sense of pointlessness. I just couldn't find anything worthwhile in the storyline, and everything seemed just bland and without a cause.It was so difficult to indulge myself into the storyline because it was so linear and anything but interesting and exciting. So the end result that is \"Cosmic Sin\" from director Edward Drake was just a very forgettable and rather mundane movie. The storyline was just so amazingly generic and linear that you could have left the movie for a longer period of time, and returned only to be right up to speed with the storyline.Now, I am sure that die-hard fans - pardon the pun - of Bruce Willis or Frank Grillo might actually find some kind of odd enjoyment here in the movie. I, however, didn't. So this movie was a swing and a miss.I must admit that it felt that Bruce Willis wasn't really committed to this movie project, and his performance felt half-hearted, as if he was running on auto-pilot. And Frank Grillo just wasn't given enough on-screen time to manage to do much of anything to salvage the movie.The characters in the movie were every bit as bland and pointless as the storyline. So you don't really connect with any of them, nor do you form any kind of attachments to any of them. So whether they live or die, it hardly matters.Now, what did work for \"Cosmic Sin\" was the visuals. They had some nice enough suits for the soldiers of the Alliance. And the weapon effects were quite good. The aliens, however, they just felt like something out of a B movie. So that was disappointing to say the least.All in all, \"Cosmic Sin\" was exactly what the movie title says; a cosmic sin. This movie came and went without leaving much of any blast mark or memorable impression. My rating of \"Cosmic Sin\" lands on a mere three out of ten stars.",

            "content": "Bruce Willis stopped caring ages ago, he's here to collect a cheque while doing the least amount of work possible. He's acting like he doesn't care, and it shows, from his very first scene he looks bored and that never changes. The problem with Bruce's approach of not caring is this; if he doesn't care, why should we?Frank Grillo's always going to be a B-grade actor because he takes what he gets. I can imagine he turns down proper dumpster fire scripts on occasion, but for the most part I'd say he's in it for the cash. Although, he's hardly in this film.With those two being the main characters, I immediately knew it wasn't going to be a good movie. The story line is boring & nonsensical, the actors are bad to middling at best. The writer can't even properly weave exposition into natural conversations or set pieces. Here's an example:The scene opens with 'Guy 1' walking by someone smoking.Guy 1: No smoking behind the wire, specialist!Guy2: Yes, sir.Guy 1: I don't give a damn if your uncle is our boss or not.LMAO! The writer couldn't even be bothered to come up with a decent way to let us know this character (in my example 'Guy 2') was the nephew of their boss. Who wrote this dialogue?! This happens numerous times, why is it so bad?! Worst of all, Guy 2 later confronts his uncle to ask if he can join the war, he even goes on to say, \"you would send them off to war, but you wouldn't send your own family?\" lol why the heck didn't you leave it there? There was no need for the initial exposition if you were going to drop it in a scene later. OMG!Okay, there are plenty of instances of that happening, so I won't harp on it. Let's get back to Bruce. So, at the (roughly) 25-minute mark there's a scene between the main-ish characters - Willis, Grillo and a third person are all there. Each one is playing a high ranking official, but Bruce Willis is clearly not in that scene, he doesn't look like he's responding to them, he nods in their general direction as if he's in the room with them, but you can clearly see he's not there with them, they do no wide-angle shots... until they do! And when they do, it's a stand-in for Bruce LMAO it's clearly not him. It's so obvious! Their heads look very different! This happens several times throughout the movie, imagine paying an actor to act and they just go, \"Nope! But he looks like me, so....\" LMAO!Ladies & gents I could go on for a day and a half but let me stop here and say this... This movie sucks! any chance it had at being a movie (not even a good one, just 'a movie') was killed when Bruce Willis was brought on. I recommend you avoid. Don't waste your time. End of story.",

I hadn't heard anywhere that a full on conflict had erupted on this planet, and didn't really get whether this was the planet from where we first encounter the aliens... act 3 doesn't really exist, what was the whole thing with Bruce Willis on the space ship, somehow hanging on while taking off leaving the planets orbit... and then the chat in space on top the ship...

But when you're at the point where even I critique the cinematography and color grading you have to be at a very low point to the degree of college-first-indie-movie-attempts-bad.\nThis is usually stuff I can overlook quite easily because I don't notice.This film basically has everything bad a film can have. From every category. Take your pick what you think is the worst.",

In this case I at least thought I would get Frank Grillo as the actual star of the movie but as it turns out he's also phoning this one with Willis. Guest he can do that after making that money In the Marvel Cinematic Universe flicks.The movie has a complex plot about survival of the fittest on an interstellar level, which was pretty much wrapped up in the trailer of the film and never really goes any further.I would love to tell you how action packed this film is but that falls short as well. It feels set up to be fluffed with action but its all lame .The only thing I truly got a kick out of was the cheap Sci-fi. You could tell they were trying to turn 20 bucks into 200 million, but sometimes those failures can give a movie charm. They had some visual effects scenes that were filmed perfectly and some of the costumes were so stylish i could not keep my eyes off of them (Making it easier to see all their flaws)If you want a really good Bruce Willis is just on the poster movie checkout Extraction, it's perfect.

            "content": "In the year 2524 an Earth colony has first contact with a hostile alien race. General Ryle (Frank Grillo) enlists disgraced \"Blood General\" James Ford (Bruce Willis) who was infamous for his use of a Q-Bomb that killed 70 Million people. Ryle enlists Ford to lead an off the books team to eliminate the alien threat before they're aloud to spread through the galaxy.Reteaming with Edward Drake and Corey Large of fellow DtV Willis sci-fi film Breach, Cosmic Sin looks and feels like it's from the same filmmakers to the point they almost feel like entries in their own \"universe\". Instead of aping Alien or The Thing like Breach, Cosmic Sin is more in line with sci-fi action like Aliens or Edge of Tomorrow. In a way I suppose Cosmic Sin is a marginal improvement on Breach, but in other ways with a larger scale story and a similar production budget, it feels noticeably cheaper than Breach as well.Much like Breach the movie doesn't feel like it takes place in the future. At least with Breach once they were on the ship they at least had proper uniforms that fit with the situation, but in Cosmic Sin everything feels like it's straight from today save for some CGI establishing shots of spaceships and some \"armor\"(we'll get to that). It's clear the movie's reach far exceeds it's grasp with the \"high tech military facility\" using the same tricks as breach to make it look futuristic with harsh multicolored lighting and poorly integrated hologram effects. But the filmmakers luckily decided to give us some locational variety with their shoot....the woods! All of the colony scenes (save for one scene with a tent) take place in the woods and have the same feeling of rushed and economic one would expect to see in a LARP straight out of Role Models. The armor the characters wear in the second half of the movie makes no sense as the script says it's approved for \"quantum combat\"(whatever that's supposed to be) and with open faced helmets and massive bare patches there's no thought or care as to how these cheap bulky monstrosities function in combat or space.Outside of the bare bones production values, the movie's script is a hodgepodge of pretty much every other sci-fi film/video game you've seen(and a few you haven't) with the likes of the 2009 Star Trek, Stargate, Edge of Tomorrow, Screamers, Gears of War, Aliens, and even Ghosts of Mars. The movie's script also tries to address \"ethical issues\" in quite possibly the most ill fitting approach since 2005's Stealth tried to analyze the moral issues of unmanned drone warfare. Willis' \"Blood General\" James Ford is so named because he quelled an separatist rebellion by dropping a Q-bomb killing 70 million people. The movie is strangely uncritical about this character with many of the supporting cast spouting things about how Ford got a \"Raw Deal\", \"It's harder to give orders than follow them\", \"you need monsters to beat monsters\", and it's the kind of mindset that many villains use for justification in many films of this ilk that makes the film feel fundamentally confused. Not that the story will draw most people in as it's poorly delivered with bad camera work, poorly staged sequences, and sleepy performances from uninterested actors with Bruce Willis' voice never even breaking an octave.Cosmic Sin continues Bruce Willis' disappointing DtV streak with an embarrassing cheap sci-fi rehash that is put to shame by amateurly made fan productions. With a sloppy production, cut and paste script, and uninterested performances that leave the movie inert and dull the movie will give you the odd laugh or smirk from point out its stolen ideas and concepts, but aside from that it's yet another cheap dud from a once respectable actor.",

All is supposed to happen in less than 24 hours, yet the movie has characters and events that seem to have happened for decades. The mismatch of technological advances is ludicrous, with rifles with ammo alongside lasers, and gas vehicles with wormhole jumps.Absurd beyond believe, there is a pocket sized weapon capable of destroying an entire solar system. Unstable, it can't be rattled and can be activated if dropped. The encasing of this technological marvel of 500 years into the future? A glass cylinder.

So what happened to Bruce Willis' movie choices? Is he in a secret competition with Nicholas Cage to star in the most B movie bombs, or is he simply bored with too much idle time? The first three sentences of this script starts off with F bombs, as if this adds to its appeal (appealing to junior high kids going through puberty, perhaps). Then we hear an atmospheric breach signal from the computer (everybody hears it, by the way), but the highly-skilled astronaut/soldier does not, and berates his companion who warns him of a pending threat. He steps out of the tent and fires randomly in every direction to prove no threat exists? Who wastes ammunition in every random direction when silence to hear an approaching threat may be useful? Not a trained soldier or security expert, that's who. Then the infected Alliance personnel are brought to the base with no extreme biohazard precautions in place? Then when the infected personnel lash out like zombies, killing a top commander, the other soldiers bearing weapons just stand there and watch him be killed?

Sad to say, I was looking for Bruce Willis to break out of his recent string of dismal flicks to really make an impact in this one, but he just looked way tired of the whole thing as Blood General James Ford, the banished soldier who dropped a Q-bomb on planet Zafdie to wipe out seventy million people. All for a good cause of course, because they were on the way to secede from the Alliance with Earth and Ellora.

The Nostromo from the Alien (1979) had a way much better med unit. Early scenes after the good and bad introductory mystery have of course the requisite robotic servers and hologram (country?) singers and a barfight with a slight difference with again the old-fashioned side arms and the Calvary with an attempt at twinge of an alternative outcome that really is not.There are major storyline problems with the quarantine procedures even simple glass windows and even a typical \"gun\" fight, yet there was an initial attempt at fascinating underlying dynamic taking place however with the first contact encounter scenes and subsequent reflective commentary. Then somehow a brief firefight does not flow well, problems with editing arise, a scene very underdeveloped, and supposedly a well-manned defensive team becomes at risk of being actually overrun. Instead of a quickening climatic pace, the energy seems to dissipate and slow down along with almost no high-tech, futuristic surveillance networks to warn of impending attacks becomes more combat scenes from a mediocre World War II movie with elements from Stargate (1994) and worse yet the climatic battle is something that would be more like out of a World War I engagement and lame hand to hand sequences and a limp effort a riveting emotional end. The screenwriters were definitely not up the job and no actor could improve on a thin script that had the promise but not the actual substance to translate into a credible movie. This movie even reverted to absolutely unnecessary cowboy, western era musical harmonics while Bruce Willis strangely just seems to fade almost completely away by the end of the movie.The major problem with Cosmic Sin lies with the screenwriters trying too hard to be cute and offer up something substance, different, and try to incorporate too many fancy relational and philosophical ideas. They failed in their execution and omitted too many important backstories to offer audiences a sense of plot flow. Instead the audience is sort of just dropped into this movie without the understanding of what the real motives of what is going on. The audience is forced to play catch up. The writers fall into their own traps with the only way out of empty ideas is to create overly convenient ways to extricate themselves out of various corners (i.e., where a general loses face for backing down on his own orders, the awkward political dynamics of the military decisions being made, past undisclosed relationships).Maybe the only nice surprise of this movie is the character and what some people might call a cameo performance of Lochlyn Munro. He appears to have finally broken out of his typecast of either simple bad guy or side character in a slew of romantic comedies. Munro had a decent performance here.",

Too bad, this movie s8(!ks...The \"story\": .....Pfff... a 9 metacritics score, that is a new record low (before it was 12).In my quest to see ALL Bruce Willis movies I also watched this one. Let's not forget that some of the movies Bruce Willis is making nowadays is only because of contractual obligations. That's the reason why he is churning out 5 till 10 movies a year upon year. That's a lot. Of course you cant be picky when you are starring in 10 movies a year. He often only stars in each movie for no more than 15 minutes or so. Producers happy, because they sell tickets with Bruce his name on the bill. Bruce Willis happy because he got his paycheck and can pay alimony to his ex-wives.

And to put it politely, some of these newest Bruce Willis movies are \"a bit\" inferior to DIE HARD.At an (excrucially) important sidenote, let us not forget WHY we are watching Bruce Willis movies to begin with. We watch Bruce Willis movies because of DIE HARD (1988). THE ONE AND ONLY BIGGEST ACTION AMERICAN ACTION CLASSIC OF THE CENTURY.This classic is still standing strong after more than 30 years. Millions of people still REwatch it during every Christmas holiday.

The plot and premise were unoriginal but okay, with a good enough script this would have been tolerable, maybe good if you wanna stretch. It's paced all wrong too, with some scenes and pauses going on too long for dramatic effect but it just made me wanna fast forward. The CGI was all bright and neon, quintessential of low budgets sci-fi movies and series to make them seem more futuristic. Also, the whole mysterious alien wormhole gate and a rogue team heading to stop it feels like a farce take on The Expanse.

The real sin hear is how badly the human to alien dialogue plays out. The director is either laughing or crying. And Spoiler: the aliens never wanted peace. Ever heard that before? There's plenty of outright dialogue stealing from a number of other films: adding a degree of shamelessness to this quagmire.With a average rating of 2.5 it's clear Willis has totally given up on caring.",

After I watched the film I decided to look at its IMDB rating to see what others thought of the film and was relieved to see that I wasn't alone in thinking this was a stinker (it's current rating of 2.5 out of 10 speaks for itself).Although many other people will have doubtlessly explained the many flaws with this film I may as well throw my hat in the ring and give my two penneth...For a start, despite the film only running for around 85-90 minutes it is excruciatingly slow with a practically non-existent storyline; I mean there's no real definitive explanation for what the aliens wanted and why they were attacking these civilisations in the first place? At one point it's mentioned that the aliens don't believe that they can co-exist with other civilisations and therefore effectively rather than destroy the people within the civilisations. They embody the people and use them as hosts to continue their destruction (effectively creating an army). This is summed up in about 30 seconds of dialogue and isn't eluded to again. To say this film lacks depth would be an understatement!!!Still shallow sci-fi isn't always bad, but if you're not going to give your audience a deep and involving story then it's usually a good idea to provide a shedload of action, sharp dialogue, interesting characters and a sense of fun. OK it's asking a lot to see all 4 elements, but even 1 or 2 of these things may have made the film just about bearable, but honestly the film is so colourless and so devoid of personality that it becomes a challenge just to sit through it.The acting is pretty poor as well; Bruce Willis isn't the best actor in the world, but he has appeared in a lot of good films meaning that if he is working with the right director and screenwriter they know this and will play to his strengths. To be honest though, given how bad this film was I think Bruce knew he was starring in a turkey and simply didn't care and therefore put no effort in at all. Everyone else is no better with many of the cast reciting their dialogue in an emotionless manner as though they were reading from an autocue. Oh and by the way guys you're meant to be soldiers so something in the way of camaraderie wouldn't have gone a miss.Believe its abysmal IMDB rating and the 1 or 2 star reviews, save 90 minutes of your life and just skip this rubbish.",

In fact, nobody has even bothered to write a synopsis on Wikipedia.What is it about? Honestly, I'm not all that sure. Is it an alien invasion that the people of Earth have to stop, or are they zombies trying to take over the Earth, and the people of Earth have to stop them. Yeah, it is pretty confusing, and doesn't seem to really have a coherent plot. Also, what is this thing about going out and destroying the aliens before they can, well, take over the Earth? That doesn't seem to be the type of thing that we should be advocating.Yeah, this film was incredibly painful to watch, and I really couldn't wait for it to be over. Sure, I could have simply walked out of the cinema, but I really don't like doing that - at all. I pretty much like to hang around until the end.

Worst of all the story is bland and it looks like it was written by some teen fed on a bad diet of unimaginative comics and boring videogames.

This is Covid, Ragnarok, and the Sun going supernova all rolled into an aluminum foil-wrapped hot pocket in a microwave. How this ever made it from script to production is a question to which the answer, if there even is one, I can assume is safely tucked inside Pandora's Box, never to be known lest it lead to more abominations like this being made on the regular.Completely bland and boring, from the dialogue to the set pieces. Scenes just come and go, offering no substance other than merely padding the time. Anyone giving this high marks because it's \"hilariously bad\" is doing a disservice by inflating the overall score (currently 2.5).The only thing that could be considered slightly decent quality is some of the special effects work, which is still outclassed by most tv commercials. Everything else will leave you wishing you could go back in time and stop Bruce from destroying that asteroid so the world wouldn't have to suffer this.",

Most of the viewing experience was me and my wife going ''huh?\" \"what?\" \"This makes no sense.\" ''Damn this is bad''.I wouldn't even recommend this movie to my worst enemy.

This is a 3rd-rate movie that hitched their ENTIRE wagon onto Bruce Willis' name... without him nobody would even have bothered streaming this movie, nevermind watching it at the theatres.This movie HAS TO have had a budget below $15mil..... it would be an absolute travesty if they spent anything more than that on this terrible movie. And I'm sorry but if you're going to attempt to make a 'sci-fi space epic adventure film' on a budget of $15mil or less then you're just insane. 1 or 2mil probably went to Bruce and that left the rest of the movie with an already shoe-string budget. The CGI is bad. The editing is bad. The majority of the movie takes place in darkness, so they didn't have to spend money on set-pieces. There's an INSANE amount of vignetting, lens flare and vaseline-lens going on as well, which is a huge indicator of a terrible production. Easily 30% of the movie is show with vaseline on the lens, I'm certain of it.There's SO MANY things that this movie COULD have done differently to make it seem like it had a bigger budget. Upgrade (2018) is a FANTASTIC example of how to make a sci-fi film with NO budget. I mean Upgrade (2018) had a $3mil budget which is absolutely insane, and if you watched that movie then you'd know that it certainly didn't seem like a shoe-string budgeted movie. Really the fault comes down on the bad director of this movie and just the whole production team as well (since the editing and framing of this movie is terrible too).This movie has no real redeemable qualities and I'd HIGHLY recommend that you watch something else instead. This movie is literally a waste of time and the only one who probably benefitted from this experience is Bruce Willis since he can walk away with a cool couple million (although I respect him less as an actor because of this movie now).",

So I said I should watch this movie that had terrible reviews. After all I do know how to fast forward.The funny thing is that I never fast forwarded which is something I do on many bad movies. Normally I go through the major parts of the movie in detail but that is not necessary here as most are bad.Acting. Bad. We now know Willis's medical condition and indeed we can see his earpiece in several scenes. That's too bad but he is still bad. The fact he pumped out 18 movies or so in his last two years to grab cash does not mean we have to accept the acting job. Grillo is also barely in it so it is left up to the other actors, most of which are just okay.Plot. On paper it looks good but it doesn't flow. We go from potential first contact to a major battle scene to wiping out the enemy all in less than a week.The reason I gave it a two instead of a one was that there were a few things I think they did different and well.KILL THE ENEMY. We often see movies where humanity is fighting aliens. I can't remember one in which humans made the decision to attack first and wipe out the other species before it became a threat to humanity. And while there were a few nay-sayers to that policy in the movie - overall it stayed on point.QUANTUM JUMP. We've seen this before in different ways but I liked how they had suits that allowed them to jump, survive in space, \"fly\" in space, and land properly. It would make travel very fast allowing for much exploring. There was no discussion about how you got back home.MARS COLONY. Earth lost the Mars colonies and it seems like a throw-away piece of information that has no relevance to the story line. Yet the fact it is in the story makes you wonder why and how the Mars colonies were not part of the Earth alliance. I suspect it was not thought out but it makes us wonder.Q-BOMB. We've seen small explosives before but this one seemed especially dangerous. Although you had to be careful carrying it but it was okay to shoot it out a cannon.ENDING. In some ways a terrible ending all around. Yet I liked that Willis finished his drink, had the flashback of his ex-wife and then just walked out alone. It re-enforced what he said to the engineer, who now seems to be in a relationship with the jerk soldier. Might have had more impact if this was the last of the Willis. Aphasia - earpiece movies.Far too much wrong with the movie to go over but one thing that irked me and it could have been good filler would have been to see the black hole develop and watch all those ships get sucked slowly into it. They took the time to give us a huge cut and paste space fleet, they at least could have shown us the fleet's demise.",

It is entertaining.I almost didn't watch due to this being rated a 2.5 overall. I mean that rating would make this a steaming piece of garbage, which it is not! I was curious how possibly bad this could be so I watched the first 10 minutes then watched the whole movie. Yes, the special effects aren't that of a 100 million dollar movie but they aren't too bad.Overall this is a good SyFy movie, definitely watchable if this is your genre. Aliens, military, action and a good enough plot with dialog. Better than the movies the SyFy channel puts out themselves. Honestly I would have rated a 6 to 6.5 but since everyone rated so low I rated it a 7. Don't rush to watch it but if you like SyFy and Bruce Willis then a good way to kill some time.I wish you could only rate if there was proof you watched the whole movie or series.I want to make this clear. Here is how ratings should work! Since we can't give a zero an average movie is 5.5. So a 5 is a little below average and a 6 is a little above average. I just jotted these all down so I am sure they could be tweaked.1 Is totally unwatchable. Complete waste of time and money! I want my eyes and time back! These are movies Elvira said no to! Burn all of these as they have zero cinematic quality to anyone!2 - This movie was rejected from the B movie festival. I would not watch again, I would never recommend and I am upset I saw it! The only reason it might do well is people watch these because they are so bad it is funny.3 - This is a B movie and not a good one at that! I was at someone's house and I could not escape. Good date movie so they might like to do something else. ^ ^ Would not recommend and I am upset I watched.4 - Ugh, This wasn't very good. I watched too much so I felt obliged to watch the rest. I am not super happy I put it on! I guess B movies fit in here.5 - Slighty below average. Watchable and okay but would not watch again.6 - Slightly above average. Watchable and a enjoyed a few parts.7 - Good movie. Happy I watched it. Some good parts in it.8 - Amazing movie. I greatly enjoyed this movie! Very happy I watched it!9 - Wow. Not a blockbuster but really enjoyed this! I would tell anyone to watch this awesome movie. I will watch again! Great job!10 - One of the best movies! I would love to see this movie again!

            "content": "EDWARD DRAKE who directed this very low-budget t.v series like Sci-fi Thriller also had written it & also had written the other Bruce Willis Sci-fi Cheapy ANTI-LIFE (2021) also & that explains why both films are so similar & i thought that as I watching it, i actually said to my wife that Willis must've gotten Deya Vu making this!!!\nI actually liked ANTI-LIFE better of the two but to be honest they do make a chilled evening of a Double Bill of Willis Sci-fi Thriller's.\nNow COSMIC SIN is set like it's other half of the Double bill, in the future but this time the world isn't destroyed but just very futuristic (with what the small budget could do) with flying cars/vehicles as well as normal cars too still & robots for a barman in the bars (Similar to Will Smith's i,Robot 2004) & lots of glowing Neon lights & things & for the most part it looks good!!! Yes it's very low-budget but i gotta admit i was impressed with alot of the look & technology they pulled off with cheap c.g.i & practical effects & the basic story is our planet has finally made contact with Alien creatures but they're hostile & when a team return from another planet that they've been stationed on, they come back possessed just like in it's close brother ANTI-LIFE & start killing everyone in the station base & here we get our team of soon-to-be heroes with the rugged old infamous ex-Commander Bruce Willis known as a warmonger due to his brutal past & it's just nice having the old skool Action legend here in such a low-budget production, even if he's only here for the paycheck!!! Willis plays his part like most these days with a calmness & a Coolness & a bad attitude just like he did in Anti-life & many other of his DTV films but i like him here & just by having him lifts its quality.\nWe also get the great B-movie legend FRANK GRILLO who i have loved since THE PURGE: ANARCHY & his Cool, rugged & no-nonsense toughness is on display again in a leader role but to be honest he doesn't get to do the action i expected & wanted but again it's great to have the veteran side by side with Willis.\nThere's a few other familiar faces but it's these two stars is why i wanted to even watch this.I will say this though that i would rather watch this flick or Anti-life over any of the ridiculously mega budget TRANSFORMERS films & more so than many of the over-blown budget trash that is put on the Cinema, Cosmic Sin is small scale but crams in a fun little Sci-fi action story with a Cool Willis leading it all even if he's not exactly giving it his all, still miles better than the usual Steven Seagal DTV flick.\nSmall minimalist budget yes but i see alot of creativity went into creating the look & it's futuristic technology & it does look Good for it's budget!!!\nAt times i got the feel & vibe of a POWER RANGERS episode or movie, especially when they gear up with body armour suits & when they fight the Alien beings (that seem like possessed humans as you Don't ever see their faces or what they really are) the villains come accross as the type that the Power Rangers would battle but hey it's a Low-budget slice of Sci-fi Thriller cheese so i just took it for that.\nOur team are power boosted through space & land on another planet that is fine for Humans & the rest of the Cheese fest plays on the forest planet with rebels (like STAR WARS) & the action is fine for a cheap flick with laser guns & possessed warriors that also reminded of John Carpenter's Ghost's of Mars just like ANTI-LIFE did too!!!! Many Sci-fi flicks enfluenced this as did ANTI-LIFE & like i said both written by Edward Drake but only this one was directed by him.Cosmic Sin just like Anti-life is a cheap, trashy & cheesy but fun B-movie that's nothing special or great but an easy watch & does make a nice Double bill with ANTI-LIFE. Entertaining & fun.",

Ive seen better costumes in that D&D movie with the purple moron evil magician. The planetary defense cannon looked like a 60s carnival ride.DIRECTION: The director lacks a basic understanding of how physics works in space or low-gravity. Heck, he doesn't even grasp earth gravity.PLOTHOLES: Beyond count...Bruce, what the hell are you thinking? That some sort of a sad attempt for one last big job before retirement? That was SAD!

I thought this was an alien flick not some vampire zombie movie. Wth? What a pos movie. \"Go go go\" or \"move move move\" when getting shot at.....lmao..Believe all the 1s. I shut this off and didn't watch the rest...45 mins in, I turned on my Xbox damn this was painful to watch half way.Example of one of the many cheesy lines:Guy- \"who do you think I am?Girl replies- \"your worst drinking buddy\"Really? Who wrote this stupid cr@pOh and the chick with the yellow and black pig tails? Listen to her cheesy laughable acting and lines. How the hell could this acting get past the producer and director?

In still images, the sort of armor suits the characters wear look cool, however any time an actor moves, it's clear they're just plastic shells hastily velcro'd onto the actor in some sort of wetsuit.All that would be entirely excusable if the actual plot, or characters, or world was engaging.

It's a decent syfy movie.I've seen comments about the \"money was spent only on actor's salaries\" (The sets were well done) - \"it's not futuristic\" (There is no promise of plasma weapons in the future) - \"12ft sniper rifles\" (Don't exaggerate reviews) - \"I want my six hundred and sixty six hours of my life back\" (Everyone wants time back) - \"I didn't watch more than the opening credits\".This movie doesn't deserve the hate or 2.5/10 rating. The absolute lowest it should be at is 4/10. It's watchable, at least one time.These 1/10 reviews are dismissible. I'm giving this a 10/10 strictly because the ratings seem to be made up of people who don't actually rate movies based on what the film offers.I'd give this a 6/10. It's good enough to make me watch it again.If you want to see a move that is less than three stars, go watch the worst of Troma's home video releases.No this isn't a masterpiece, I'd argue it's better than The Hudson Hawk, which I can't bring myself to sit through again.",

Believe it or not, some of the most loved movies of all time had wide camera angles that didn't change every 0.3 seconds. Like Die Hard...Bruce Willis already did 5th Element. Unless you wanted to try to beat it, this is a waste of time. To involve him and make him the prime poster cover when really he's just a cameo most of the movie, is poor salesmanship. You would have been better to try a Fifth Element 2 than this Jason X meets Riddick.The directing was just awful, the lines were COMPLETELY unbelieveable from the start.

He still gave a solid performance, but the script was not put together well at all. Certain lines and scenes lead to nowhere. I mean, really, the sunglass scene with the kid and Dash? What was that? At least the sunglasses weren't on General Ryle like they were on Admiral Adams in Breach.SPEAKING OF\nBreach vs Cosmic SinWas this Edward Drake's and Corey Large's attempt at redeeming themselves from Breach OR just another attempt to ruin Bruce's image.Same movie, swap out actors center around Bruce, and make another bad film. At least the F/X were a little bit better (and that's not saying much).So Bruce still plays the same role. Clay young becomes James Ford. Former Hard Charging Military Combat Officer reduced to drinking but still a bad arse.They swapped out Thomas Jane for Frank Grillo (without shades but same disposition) and gave them the same fate. AND I mean THE SAME FATE! Instead of giving Grillo a daughter, we gave him a relative in Braxton (Brandon Lee) to be over protective of and with reverse love interest with the Fiona. Swapped out Timothy Murphy for Costas Mandylor (with accents) and slightly different outcomes but still the SAME FATE. And we are ready to ... Not do much but the same as before.PLOTS: Okay slightly different plot where we in Breach mess up the earth (which we are doing now) vs Aliens coming to claim us and the earth/galaxy. BUT still based on Aliens able to inhabit human bodies. I get why in Breach, but what was the point in Cosmic Sin? They already have bodies. Again BAD Alien visuals. Okay Horrible. The Cosmic Sin Aliens were in plastic Priest outfits. And please explain to me why a highly advanced alien race chooses to charge into battle with sometimes swords and other times guns? This contradicts earlier when Dr. Lea points out, \"they learned how to use our weapons in seconds\"? UHM, they looked just like the ones they were firing later on.Again please make up your mind about the weapons. Bullets or Lasers (same issue in Breach)?Noticeable mention/shout out. I carried a SAW in the military, and to see CJ PERRY (AKA LANA) one-handed carry around that cannon laser made question if i ever lifted a weight in my life. She was a beast.Scene transistion:\nWhen Ford went to the armory to get a weapon at the beginning of the movie, how did he end up with NOT what he grabbed in the next scene when he uses it? He grabbed big laser rifle but instead showed up in the following scene shooting what looked like a Rocket Launcher when he took out the initial invading force on the base? Not even going to get into the scene where he is escorted into a cave with the cast of Cirque Du Soleil at the entrance. Tell me why the one alien is one arm and foot hanging on the tree? Where the hell did Braxton come from? Oh and what was that fight scene about between Braxton and the Alien?It's as though the directors did not care about the set, yet again. We are five centuries in the future using quantum physics to transport people hundreds of thousands of light-years away, yet we are still showing 600-year-old technology in the form of combustible engine pick-up trucks. Couldn't borrow some vehicles from Elon? Oh, let's not forget the motorcycle. But yet we have scenes of flying cars in the skyline one scene then a freeway with old vehicles the next. Speaking of transporting. Those \"space suits\" are able to allow you to survive in outer space without any form of Oxygen tanks (must be that 500 year new tech) And allow you to zoom through outer space, re enter another planets atmosphere not burn up and LAND the perfect landing that would make any gymnast blush but not correct when you bump into your fellow soldier?

In 'Halo' they encounter the alien threat in the year 2525, after years of military government fighting rebels or insurrections in their outer colonies. And wouldn't you know it, in 'Cosmic Sin' they have first contact in 2526 after years of fighting rebels.Bruce and Frank... you two do not need to do this.

He just recently made another cheap sci_fi movie, Breach, so I guess he must like them-either that or maybe he owes somebody money or a favor. Anyway, this one takes place in 2524, when the earth has colonized some other planets, some of which were inhabited. Bruce was a war hero-he killed a bunch of aliens-but some people didn't like the way he did it, so he was discharged unceremoniously. Some aliens attack a group of earth people on a remote survey planet and Frank-a general-calls in Bruce to do what Bruce likes doing; putting the aliens in their place. Costas is a Sargent in the squad that is assembled and Perrey is a doctor/former love interest to Bruce. Some of the story is a little jumbled and hard to make sense of at times-the aliens are wearing long blazers with hoodies to probably hide the low budget. There are even times when it's hard to tell exactly who the good guys are-the humans or the aliens. Of course, that might have been the producers objective in the first place; to have a debate on war.\nIt's rated \"R\" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 28 minutes.\nI like bad movies-at times-but they do need a coherent storyline, at least. I wouldn't buy this on DVD. I wouldn't rent it either. If you really want to see it, I would wait until it shows up on cable.",

I have done since the 80s, but it's usually when you can see passion and effort put into something, even if it's rough around the edges.What makes me not only disappointed but a little sad about movies like Cosmic Sin, is that you can tell most of the people behind it simply didn't care. It's either so cheap that with a name like Bruce Willis it becomes profitable regardless of effort, or it's some kind of tax write-off.Of all the amateur writers and film-makers out there, I'm sure they could have found someone looking for an opportunity to make the best of a low-budget, and see it as an opportunity to make the best small movie they can. The resources are there... A few of the actors in Cosmic Sin are actually not bad, and known from other TV shows and small movie parts, and some of the visual effects actually aren't bad, so it's a shame to see the talents and skills of those people wasted on this dire effort. I suppose at least a couple of the effects people will have something half-decent for their showreel...The scriptwriter/s, director and editor/s should frankly be ashamed of themselves. A low budget does _not_ have to mean a bad film (not this bad, anyway), and when you have an opportunity and squander it like this, you should do the honourable thing and find a new career.

Bruce Willis should get himself a better agent and stop acting in B-grade movies like this. If he's not careful, he'll follow in the footsteps of Nicholas Cage and Steven Seagal.The movie started out well enough. It built tension and had a unique story - First contact with an alien species. But it went sideways from there. The movie for me had too many holes in the plot. I didn't like the slow-fast-slow-fast-slow pace of the movie. The director for some reason, like to cut into looooong meaningless dialogue that just slowed down the pace of the narrative. If the purpose of these slow parts was to build backstory for the characters, well it didn't work. It was just annoying. I found myself yelling at the screen \"...get a move on already...\"SUMMARY: Too many holes in the plot and the narrative, lack-lustre at best. The aliens where 2-dimensional. They were there just to serve just as the enemy. Not much is shown about them.RECOMMENDED? No.",

Frank Grillo gets top billing but is on screen for about 5 minutes.\nMid to late movie direction is particularly poor, as you sometimes enter the zone of \"spooky ghostly characters in the dark\" and dudes in plastic outfits that bear no resemblance or relation to the interesting type of antagonist encountered in the first act.The redeeming quality is that it makes you think about what a cool story this could have been if it had a giant budget.

I barely remember anything else about the plot but it doubt any of it was important. It was so lazily written that it might as well have been auto-generated by an Xbox 360.I don't know what anyone was doing or even thinking while they were making this lousy attempt of a film. Every single component of the film just seems so lazy and uninspired that its likely everyone involved was half asleep during the production process. From a technical standpoint its almost as bad as Snyder's Army of the Dead (I honestly don't understand the appeal). The film looks ugly in parts. Like AotD a lot of the background is out of focus, but here it appears to be an attempt to block the cheap production designs. The visual effects had the quality of a 10 year old episode of Doctor Who, and the sound editing was flat and lifeless. This is bad even by DTV standards.As for Bruce, what the heck has happened to him?! He looked tired and worn out, like a retired has-been who's desperate for money. There's one line of dialogue that summarizes Bruce's current state. When he puts on an exosuit and one of the characters say that it \"belongs in a museum\", he quips: \"They said the same thing about me.\" And he's not wrong.Just stay retired Bruce, nobody wants to waste 90 minutes of their time for useless fodder like this.",

The cinematography is OK, but there's minimal green screen usage. It's as if they intentionally spent absolutely as little as possible on sets and props; literally a shoe string budget.

It's terrible, don't get me wrong, but because of the recent news regarding Willis, I'm going to omit him from this review (he's barely in it, and his character serves nothing to the films narrative).What we get is a film about some people who get possessed by something and shoot black goo at other people, whom then become possessed. And this has something to do with other people dressed in black.It's as if the makers have filmed a lot of scenes, thrown them together, and just released it without nobody proof watching it for consistency and narrative flow.Frank Grillo is first billed, but he's hardly in it, and ends up in space, doing something that makes no sense at all. The same goes for Mandylor. He pops up in the first act, gets shot, and then he gets killed by one of his allies, because 'he was going to die anyway'.It's a seeing is believing film for sure, you have to see it because it makes no sense at all, and thats the reason why the film is terrible. Somewhere in this atrocity is a half decent film, begging to get out, but it's beyond comprehension, and it just finishes, and you are left agog, at what you have just experienced.Yep, it's a sin alright.",

Here he offers another low budget-feeling sci-fi action. The score, some sets, special effects are impressive but it's execution is a little stilted along with the script. That said, there's some breakout moments from the supporting cast, notably Costas Mandylor as frank talking Marcus Bleck.Boasting the likes of Frank Grillo and Willis, both actors are under-utilised. Cosmic Sin works well enough as an Aliens come Star Trek, even Ghosts of Mars derivative. That's said, it's reminiscent of a late 80s, early 90 direct to video science fictions, Nemesis, APEX, Terminal Force etc however, many made during that period were usually innovative, regrettably there's very little to write home about in the case of Cosmic Sin as it meanders from location to another, jumping from one scene to another. In between borrowing lines from other movies. At one point a character says, \"This is crazy, I don't need this...\" which is exactly how I felt watching. Viewers maybe left wondering how Drake managed to bag such talent on a seemingly lacklustre science fiction as Willis fires bullets into the infected.Overall, if this was made 25 years ago it may have been a VHS DTV hit but despite Drake's efforts and crisp visuals it sadly feels tired and worn.",

By the way, Neil Blomkamp called and says he wants his lauded integrity back.So yeah, \"Sin\" was released in March of this year (its title in India is actually Worthless Rip-Off). It's a direct-to-video flick that also poses as something you'd see on well, the Syfy channel. Cosmic Sin tries to be part Blade Runner, part Ghosts of Mars, part Elysium, and part Aliens. Sadly with its characters bickering back and forth like the Bickersons, \"Sin\" feels more like 2000's veritable bomb, Supernova.Cosmic Sin is poorly lit in a soft bulb sort of way. It also has action scenes that are choppily edited, actresses you feel sorry for (I'm talking about you Perrey Reeves), and a script that contains enough sci-fi mumbo jumbo to denounce any normal ritual. Bruce Willis stars in \"Sin\" and you know what that means. Aside from unloading a rifle, projecting his last shred of screen presence, and looking like Iron Man without full headgear, Brucie appears like he's in a coma with no chance of reverse stupor.Taking place in the year 2524 (that's random) and directed by Australian Edward Drake, Cosmic Sin is basically about Gen. James Ford (Bruce Willis) trying to stop a fleet of aliens that I guess look like humans. Willis doesn't do or say much but hey, he's Bruce \"I used to be a beast\" Willis. He probably got paid by the line (or any catatonic facial expression).Bottom line: Any way you cut it, I probably should've avoided watching Cosmic Sin. Its intentions are good considering but come on, it's more like \"cosmic\" debris (no pun intended for the late Frank Zappa). Forgive me for I have \"sinned\".",

It was hard to tell what stars like Frank Grillo and Bruce Willis were doing throughout the film. While Grillo delivers whenever he's on screen, Willis just doesn't seem interested. Also, while the film initially moves at a fast pace with some good action, it goes downhill the moment it tries to inject emotion through bland character conversations; not one of these scenes contribute to the plot and are merely a failed attempt. Even most of the action is dull. The second half is where it loses its only chance to end up a watchable film. Cosmic Sin is disappointing, and its poorly written plot could've been better if it was trimmed to a 1-hour TV film duration. Scenes to remove? Plenty.",

The \"futuristic\" armor pieces are almost comically ill-fitting and awkward but have enough detail to make it tolerable. Combat is rather non-sensical, they clearly did whatever felt cool and didn't cost any extra and paid minimal attention to any kind of real tactics or gunplay. The story progression makes sense if only by a thread. Nothing wrong with the acting. Cinematography absolutely feels like it's done on a budget but it's done well enough.

The reviews here are point on. I wish I could give this a movie a zero. It was the worst crap I've seen all year.I don't know if Bruce owes someone money or everyone in this film is hurting for cash because of COVID. It sucked BADLY. Seriously save your time and skip this one. It had everything bad that you could think of in a movie.The plot was weak and missing any details that would've made this movie somewhat interesting. The actors looked like they didn't care to be there, especially Bruce who seemed drunk or stoned most of the time. Also, the actions of the characters made absolutely no sense \"put your hands up\" to people that are decaying and zombie-looking. What the hell?!The editing was nauseating at best. The dialogs, oh god the dialogs were long and boring. Yak yak yak with pointless fillers that only extended the torture of trying to watch this.The CGI was mediocre at best. My pre-teen daughter plays with Blender and can do a WAY better job that what they did in this movie for CGI effects. The props were also pretty bad. Someone on here stated their suit of armour looked like plastic. No, it wasn't plastic, more like spray-painted foam with two colored LEDs mounted on each side of their heads. I have a 3D printer and I can make way better props than the ones used in this film. The music kept repeating the same annoying rhythms and drowning out the dialogs at times (may be I should be thankful for that).I found myself fast forwarding a lot through this movie HOPING for something good, for ANYTHING to redeem this crap that was wasting my precious time, but I was sorely disappointed. I can go on and on about how bad this was but I feel I've ranted enough. Please trust the reviews here, they are right. If not just trust me and avoid this one like the plague.",

They were barely in any scenes and they clearly skimmed in other places.Bruce Willis's right hand man was not the army type at all and we get one of the weirdest scenes I've ever seen where he is talking to a young girl who apparently appeared out of nowhere that he's going to \"save\" her. It was so uncomfortable. Before that we get about 45 min of one on one side conversations between characters that were just awful.The scene where they are flying through the galaxy I absolutely started dying. They looked like Power Rangers!! They travel 13 light years in minutes but when two of them crash into eachother they just go off course a little. Lmao. Who was their physics consultant? Joe Biden?There's reference to the Alliance govt but that is never shown. So the biggest event in human history is fought by a handful of rag tag military guys. Ohh and the Aliens sent a handful of soldiers to fight initially rather than send their ships through immediately and keep the element of surprise. They ran out of money for Bruce Willis and Frank Grillo so they kept them in those absolutely laughable Quantum suits and just used their voices. This could have been good. The set, the acting, the CGI all awful. Even the Entourage and Old School actress was awful in her role.This movie is a jumbled mess. It's so freaking bad but not even funny bad. It's mostly pointless side convos and horrible special effects. We never really even get to see the aliens and what they actually look like! Pathetic!!",

No amount of 'special sauce', extras in bikinis or a high body count will make up for a crap script. Trust me, I saw \"Batman vs Superman\" twice.Special effects are pretty Amiga. Maybe school film club should upgrade? Just a thought.And this film does give you lots of time to think. It does not try to monopolise your attention like \"12 Angry Men\" or \"One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest\". No sir, this film lets you indulge your free-thinking gene. Lots.

We want movies that require real thought to understand and use our imagination. The issue is that many people had very high expectations for this movie, due to the casting of Bruce Willis as the main character.In contrast, if the movie was cast of main characters that are not well known, people would have no real expectations for a top shelf movie, and would be impressed by the visuals and originality, and would have a rating in the 5.5 to 6.5 range.That being said, here we have a movie that gives us what we have been asking for... but how did we respond? With hyper-critical disdain and complaints, and worst of all, a 2.5 rating. Come on now people.. Don't be so hard on this movie.

Willis' character is supposedly the notorious character who followed orders to release a 'q-bomb' on another planet and killed lots of beings. Suddenly on a planet which is supposed to be uninhanbited, a few members of the \"alliance\" are attacked by an unknown source, believed to be an alien and no one knows for sure. And then, when it becomes apparent that there are problems, grizzled Willis must be brought back one more time to potentially do the dirty deed to protect the world because they think they need to... because it's an alien group.Frank Grillo enters and brings his usual A-game and is fine. He does what he can with his part to at least look interested and try to be convincing. The bit characters are mostly OK with some rough edges. Willis looks tired, annoyed and like he couldn't be more disinterested throughout the film. Even during one of the most \"intense\" parts when he could be destroyed, the camera pans on him and he's got a look of boredom.The problem is that most of the film feels like total filler. Characters use terms you've heard in numerous other space movies to describe stuff that is supposed to be \"space cool\" to make you buy into the fact that wearing spacesuits (and only spacesuits) to travel millions of miles is a good idea. Doesn't quite work.To sum up how poor the dialogue in this film is, one of the characters has problems with the space flight path. So he says \"AI, adjust flight path.\" Why would a human need to tell the AI to adjust a flight path? We don't even do that today, and certainly not hundreds of years in the future, which looks a LOT like it does today.So how does the story resolve? Like numerous others you've heard before, just far more talky, which is a very bad thing, and without much of it really making too much sense to be believeable. It's watchable for the laughs but totally pointless.",

Sometimes you know something's supposed to be happening, but between awkward angles, blur effects, and darkness, you don't know what they're trying to show you. Other times you know what they're trying to show you because half the scene gets it across, but another half doesn't match: like a shot with a main character staring out at the enemy, a cut to show enemies dying, back to the character now in close up even with some gun flashes, back to more enemies dying - but the character isn't actually holding up his gun.* There's no character development, yet key scenes are built around the assumption that there is. You're clearly supposed to feel empathy for the decisions they have to make, but you've never had a chance to build up any affinity with them in the first place. Not to mention they're all antagonistic towards each other, and yet in the end you're given the impression they've developed close bonds.* It can't decide what it wants to be. It's hyper futuristic in one case (their spacesuits border on high fantasy magic), while very mundane in others (a pretty standard pistol; no face protection on their suits, and some fist fights). It tries to be stylish (the Tarantino or Keanu kind) in some places, but attempts to be more grounded and dramatic (like Armageddon or The Day After Tomorrow) in others, completely failing at both. Sometimes it borderlines on arthouse, but isn't.Oh, and there are multiple hints at potential plot developments that go nowhere. Are they intentional red herrings? We'll never know, because the acting was so poor you don't know if some implications were accidental. Either way, any of those red herrings panning out would have made for a more interesting plot.Maybe one day there'll be a reboot that makes it all work.",

I didn't watch, however, because of Bruce; I watched it because of Frank Grillo, who has churned out a few lesser known B-movie gems in the past that earned my admiration. Unfortunately, this movie is not one of them. Pairing Bruce and Frank with this movie is like icing a turd, yeah, it looks pretty from a distance, but get close and it still stinks. Bad plot, bad FX, and bad acting make a bad movie. Skip this one.",

Lingering in slow annoying dialog with stupid ominous over the top music inappropriately place throughout. No real adequate thought put toward the future, the most futuristic thing in the movie looks like a laser-tag vest. The CGI is C-Class in that it feels so separate from the actors on screen, and then those ridiculous cheap SFX start again, every second there has to be some overworked SFX or dramatic music! It's reaally not that dramatic. I really feel like a movie can sometimes waste their budget on a big name actor and this is one of those. It's poorly designed and implemented which is a shame, but hopefully some of them had fun making it.",

Compared to most movies out there that starts with humans coming face to face with an evil alien race, this movie starts from the middle.That first contact already happened, they dropped a bomb that creates a black hole and 70 million lives were wiped out. This movie takes place after that tragic event. The humans now have a better understanding of the alien race and what they're capable of. So they set in place the \"Cosmic Sin\" protocol.Although the movie fails at making the action scenes interesting, they do help a lot at progressing the plot. What would have been better was that the movie would have spend more time expanding on the lore and background of the whole story.",

Everybody needs to start somewhere? I watched it twice. I'm a Frank Grillo fan plus I forgot I watched it already lol. I don't think Bruce was that bad. He didn't have much of a part to work with. Neither did Frank. The audio could have been better. So could the plot and the directing. I've definitely seen worse and it's not hard to find better. 2 years into covid and content is getting thin. The internet churns out tons of dodgy stuff so it's not hard to find something to be negative about. Narrow opinions and short sighted views abound. I like a bad movie with a friendly face more than just a bad movie so it's worth at least one star. This one has two. Watch it or don't watch it.

They walk around the woods for awhile and sometimes there is a bit of fog.The \"aliens\" are first introduced in the dark so you can't see anything at all. Attacking a planet where we are specifically told only 2 people live as a forward mining post but the \"survivors are brought back to earth\" and there are suddenly 8 of them. They walk in lock step, covered in alien sores, growling, turn their heads at the exact same time. The second they appeared on screen it was obvious they were enemies. It takes 3 minutes of this before the elite soldiers notice though.We will get a scene of a fleet battle in space very briefly but it's the first time we've seen a space ship so we have no idea who is winning, who is losing and how there is a battle going on when they only attacked a mining post with 2 people on it.It wasn't enjoyably bad or anything.

It's not told well at all. It feels like there are scenes missing, or someone forgot a voiceover. It just goes from random happening to all-out war with some unknown something. I'm used to movies where we know as much as the actors. In this movie, I get the horrible feeling that we know less than they do. We're left in the dark most of the time. Again, the feeling that scenes were left unfilmed, or edited out completely.The effects are passable. The scenery, what there is, is just a warehouse in Georgia and a bar set (probably at the same location). The rest of the time we're somewhere in the woods (probably in Georgia again).I get that this is a budget movie, but better movies have been made, and probably for less.

There were some young actors that show some promise. Willis said less than 50 words throughout the entire film. How can you justify, paying this guy a ton of money for a nothing part. They could have hired someone coming up that could have filled the space. Willis is one of my favorites, and like John Wayne, loved him but just doesn't hit the screen with that POP. I would much rather see Willis doing more drama, romance films, maybe. He really looked tired in this as well. Give him an early retirement. Go fishing Bruce, and leave the movie business to the new kids.",

And they aren't even sure of what is going on. They run for a nuclear bomb just because they've got a gut feeling. You don't get to sympathise too much with the carachters cause you don't get to know who the hell they are apart from military grades, so the suspense about their destiny gets killed too. There are some injustified \"visions\" implied. The aliens looks exactly like Lovecraft's Chtulhu, I mean, at least whip up something new. One of the final scene it's just unbereably stupid as it was written by an unsecure kid who represents himself as a big hero engaging a fist fight and then violently stabbing a nearly dead alien.

But the film says nothing. No soul, no real drama. I wanted to be on the edge of my seat having looked at the premise... I sincerely have had more tension and drama on the edge of my toilet seat than when I was watching this movie.Once the aliens appear then it goes full pelt into an alien-zombie type battle that is somewhat reminiscent of James Cameron's \"Aliens\" from 1986. The cinematography also is worth noting in its a throwback to \"Blade Runner\" at times, but these are rare and the body of the film looks good and reasonable, but nothing creatively new.Rather long-winded and somewhat boring sequences ensue, some with potentially romantic undertones, along with recollections of past war wounds and pathetic sentimental dialogue that smacks of being added as an afterthought once a first edit was screened, the studio realising the movie has no emotion. Which it still doesn't.Some of it is fun, the special effects although I usually hate CGI are passable, but the lack of humanity and drama, unfortunately, makes the film fail on an emotional level, where it really could have been something that excels.As I have said it also fails miserably on a dramatic level... they just phoned it all in. What a waste of money this was.\"Die Hard\" managed to pack in more drama and emotion, it's a shame that Bruce Willis and filmmakers of today don't seem to be capable or even willing to endeavour to achieve anything that even remotely compares. 2/10.",

Human crew made contact and are infected and are taken into decontamination. No protocol is used as the space ship lands. The wisecracking soldiers walk the individuals inside as if the granma just arrived for Sunday supper...even though one girl is shoulder twerking with a white face and an ugly blister on her nose, another dude has also abnormal veins on his white face, etc. They get \"decontaminated\" in a shower area that looks like it belongs to a fitness gym by a dude in a painters outfit with a fire extinguisher. When all hell breaks loose and infected start attacking, the base alarm goes off...but no soldiers really come aside of the two that just died and were hesitant to shoot even as base people were dying. The Doctor doesn't want them dead at this point b/c they're beautiful to her. When the base goes on lockdown, the lights go red--the lights are the kind you buy at Home Depot and stick them against the shower tile of this \"gym\". The battle area now cuts into a bigger warehouse, like the stock room of your local Target.The actors have blooper smirks(!) on their face throughout these scenes even as they're dying. The scene gets resolved with Bruce Willis \"John Wayne walking\" into the scene with a missile launcher and taking out the brood with an \"explosion\" that is weaker than a 4th of July kids party. The explosion is so wea(!)but takes out the brood at the extreme ends. LOL! At one point in an earlier scene, the Dr. Smirkingly says \"I'm a doctor not a God\" when one soldier asks her to fix his friend who's been shot in the head (YES!... Quality screenwriting!)OH YES! I wanna see the Director's Cut and actor commentary!Ok no more piling on the hate.

Some producer has pictures of you hitting pandas and threatened to release them if you were not part of the cast ?\nWhat's unforgiving is that you did another film with Mr Edward Drake called \"Breach\" which is already rated from bad to suicide inducing.\nWhy again ?Cosmic sin it is",

            "content": "As most of you already know, as of late Bruce has been in some pretty bad (but hilarious!) B level movies, such as: First kill, Hard kill, Survive the night, Breach and my personal favorite, Trauma Center. If you ever need a good laugh or feeling down, I recommend watching this movie. Trauma Center will make you laugh till it hurts. All his current movies have low rent, substandard acting, atrocious facial expressions, the plot is always dead weight and never makes any type of sense. No character development whatsoever, bad bad bad special effects. The list continues. But yet you are glued to the television to see how bad it truly can get. Also, his movies recently have something else in common. Frank Grillo, Chad Michael Murray and Bruce Willis performing like he is three sheets the wind. Does he show up to work on set drunk?? And on the day of filming he finally reads his script for the first time and in 10 minutes they start shooting the film?? Bruce has lost it. It's quite sad but it's hilarious. He has terrible facial expressions, acts like he doesn't want to be there and he is in these movies for about 10-15 minutes! Cosmic sin is the same exact way. Frank Grillo (who's a bad as* in the purge movies) went full Bruce Willis mode and acted drunk with terrible facial expressions and acted like he didn't even want to be there. Everyone in Cosmic Sin including CJ Perry a.k.a Lana from the wwe is absolute garbage in this film and is a terrible actress. 25 minutes into this movie I fell asleep. That should say something, right? It made zero sense. The special effects were laughable and it seemed like they were designed and produced by a kindergartner. The director, producer, and whoever wrote the screenplay should feel absolutely embarrassed that this disaster film was even made. But yet, I look forward to the next disaster in the Bruce Willis catalog. So, if you ever need a laugh, feeling sad, or even feeling miserable, I recommend watching this film or any of his recent films. I look forward to the day Bruce Willis and Nick Cage star in a movie together. Talk about classic!",

How do such stupid aliens (dumber than us and we're so dumb it seems contrived for a plot twist) build an inter dimensional portal that spans 680k light years only to let us blow it up with what amounts to a firecracker after letting us send a super nuke through. Oh sorry I spoiled it. Can such rot be spoiled? I mean - nobody reads these to see if they should see a movie. It's not like it's an actual movie we'd pay for at a theater. We come to see if we're crazy. Attack of the killer tomatoes has better acting. The plot could easily have been written during a morning crap. The shaky darkened cinematography wasn't fooling anyone as to the budget or scale of the lack of action or effects. Ok enough.",

They did do deep dives into the military and the practical side of soldiering as well as the ethics of war.

But then, I thought, why? What's the point? It's not going to get better. Will I feel good for having finished it? No, I decided. And that was that.It's too bad really. I love a sci-fi/space movie, so I tend to be quite lenient with them. Having said that, this one: terrible.The acting was okay. Not great. Some terrible spots. Bruce wasn't good. At all. Most others were just okay. Shoot, even the story might have been okay. But the screenplay was just bad. Bad dialogue. Bad scenes. I had a bad feeling when the movie opened up with like 5 F-bombs (just to be clear, I personally have absolutely no issue with bad language). Nothing screams \"I'm trying to be an edgy film, you better take me seriously!\" like opening up with 5 F-bombs. Ugh. And Bruce. I don't know if he needed some beer money, or this was a personal favor to a friend or something, but I would have figured a quick pass through the script and he would have been like \"Nope.\" But not the case. I attribute his wooden, \"I don't care\" acting to the fact that he must have agreed without reading the script, saw what he got himself into, figured it was too late to back out, so phoned in his lines.And then right at the beginning when the alien-human things land in the ship (I'm not listing this as a spoiler since it's literally like 20 min into the movie) at the base, and there is literally no containment or ANYTHING between the 5 people that showed up for First Contact (seriously - this is supposed to be a BIG DEAL, First Contact, and there are like 5 people there for it?) so of course when the alien-humans start killing people there is no containment, no quarantine. Just everyone right there, all ready to be infected or something. It's just simply stupid. It's lazy writing, it's clear that the plot requires it for Edgy F-bomb Action and Awesome Gun Shootings. It's terrible. Completely unbelievable.So I gave up. It's not worth the time to finish. But hey, it's nice to know people are driving what appear to be gas powered Jeeps 500 years in the future. Seriously, it's set 500 years in the future (FIVE. HUNDRED. YEARS.!) and the cars they drive on roads look exactly like what you see today. I weep for the future.Give this one a miss. Trust me.

But with a number of actors I did not recognize, and had all the markers of being a low budget looking film. Hmm... Bruce must have been bored and needed something to do and was paid a big chunk of change to do this or was doing a favor for someone trying to get their foot in the door of the film industry.As others stated, the advancement of humans and technology nowhere matched what one would expect for the time period set for this movie. This looks like it is set in say... the year 1994 with the exception of the space crafts.I've seen more futuristic characters, imaginative set designs, makeup, wardrobe and creativity in 22+ year old films like \"the 5th Element\",\"the Matrix\", \"Alien\"; a 42 year old movie which STILL holds its own and let us not forget \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" released in 1968 - a now 53 year old film.All this film delivered were a multitude of recognizable rip-offs from dozens of 90's sci-fi films and TV shows with a script sounding like it was written by a teenager and a forgettable story.Poor direction combined with horrible dialogue and poor acting make for a tedious film watching experience.Any moments that should be suspenseful fall flat and there's no chemistry between any of the actors. It almost feels as if they are all doing a dry run of the script while being filmed and in costume. Deaths and \"shoot-em-up\" scenes somehow lack any emotion, tension, or gravity; for me they evoked the same emotions as if I were watching a group of people standing in line waiting to check out at the grocery store. I was actually just distracted from the film just now by a number of birds that just flew past our office window and into a bush in the neighbor's yard - \"What's going on!\" I exclaimed. \"8 sparrows just flew into a bush across the street into the same spot!\" - \"I wonder what's in there and what's going on?\". Sorry, now back to my review - which I'm doing while sort of watching the film, but not really, anymore... as I've lost complete interest in it.Is there truly no imagination left in the film industry? This isn't the only piece of waste out there that somehow made it from script to screen instead of going to the scrap heap where it belongs. I'm sorry for being so harsh, but I just don't know how this movie ever came to be.This is definitely one of those films where one would say \"That's 43 minutes of my life that I can't get back.\" *I started doing other things due to how bad this film was, so all told, I saw about 43 minutes of the film.Sorry guys, I'm going to give this a HUGE thumbs down.Save yourself the time and invest your time doing anything other than watching this. You've been warned!",

The right cast was hired, and the story had potential.I can only assume that director Edward Drake never believed in it, or was looking simply for a quick paycheck. I can say Drakes career can only go up from here.The acting is sloppy, the dialog is 1999. The CGI had to been purchased off Fiverr to reduce costs. What could have been super cool the battle armor, was cosplay if you had a good budget but not skill. The scene where they try and put on their helmets was absolutely painful. They had to cut scene it because the actors could not get it on.As I said by the title we wanted Halo, we had hoped for a character to charm us like Master Chief. Nope. Instead we got a old grizzled character that we are introduced getting drunk and ends getting drunk. So everything in between is a hangover...which would explain the dialog or lack of.I would have like to cheer for some of the characters, but honestly they all could have died and we would have not noticed. The really only important person is the Engineer that everyone constantly puts down. Nice stereotyping in 2500.This is such a bad flick most reviewers never got past the first 20 minutes. I stayed for the whole thing, but wanted to fast forward after 15. This flick will be forgotten by end of the week, but it could have been amazing.

Although the special effects were okay the \"earth\" looked like it is today so I didn't have the feeling of 2500 or so (time period of the movie).Overall I can not recommend this, a waste of valuable time.

This would be a fine sci fi attempt as a budget movie, but having two mega stars brings to light they had money and seemed to use it all on these two.Props: So having being in the prop world for a very long time. In movies using polyvinyl (pvc) is almost a dead method, except for budget movies. Everything from their armour to weapons look like plastic, and no matter the skill of the artist you can't really be convinced it's metal. Willis armour is probably painted the bettern painted due to the use of colour. But everyone else's literally looks like plastic and even with the \"clang\" sound effects you can tell they're moving in plastic. Where I was done is the small woman carrying a 2 metre futuristic 50 cal sniper with one hand. It bounces around like it's made of foam. It doesn't help keep you convinced this world is real. Also at one point the enemy is carrying a sword and it literally looks like a foam sword used for casting. It's not even slightly convincing or menacing.CGI: Given the horrible props the CGI was actually quite good! I would have rather see CGI armour, while not a preferred practice I think it would have helped.Story: literally couldn't keep up or understand wtf was happening Haha. It was a choppy ridiculous mess.",

Sounds good?\"The movie is supposed to take place 500 years into the future. But nothing feels futuristic. Actually the feeling is rather that civilization taken steps back, and some generals and ex generals takes some decisions of erradicating a alien civilization without running it past the government. The future technology has no thought behind it, and seems just play a part in giving the author to this movie loop holes to build their story around.Why Bruce Willis takes part in this crap is beyond me. Once he was a somewhat regarded actor, but perhaps the deal i described above is too good to turn down.Nothing makes sense, not the scenery, not the acting, not the plot or the fact that aliens apparently prefeer to use spears and swords when attacking hoomans with automatic weaponry. Drake, Large and Willis has more projects going on, and my only lingering question is who the fxxx finance this crap? Does Drake or Large have rich family? I cant think Bruce finance any of it. And im not suggesting it has a big budget, but still some money have to gone into it and that is baffling.Dont waste your time on this one.

The best part, from my perspective, is that Sci-Fi can provide a deep and interesting framework from which they derive an engaging story, even with a low budget.This film failed to provide the deep and engaging material that one hopes for in a Sci-Fi movie. The scenes were rushed, thrown together, leaving the viewer asking way too many questions about how things ended up the way they were or blatantly laughing at the lack of thought put into the plot. It was empty-feeling, failing to draw me into the film. Perhaps others will experience something different, but this was not a well-made movie.

            "content": "To proclaim this as a (DvD), movie masterpiece, would streach anyone's mental capability.Amidst last 4 of 12, (since 2018 for Willis), this Sci-Fantasy film, shows every hallmark of being drastically under prepared once the principle actors were informed of the Pandemic restrictions pending & whole production went into 3 takes only mode.Around which some of the world's fastest editing must have been given only most rudimentary quality control.Real challenge for viewers is to comprehend the plot, and where the movie develops some creative purpose.It's production features elements akin to being a poorly realised 'Steam-Punk', story ineptly re-styled towards a convention centre cos-play re-enactment.Considering the strong evocation of themes within 'Edge of Tomorrow' and corresponding good visuals of Bruce and Frank, in enhanced armour; yet devoid of any true nihilist wit, the weakness surely resides with having a bland script.Putting aside, the main cast, manages to elevate slightly roles that would otherwise go completely ignored. Short co-star parts are common in established sci-fi / action films (especially female), and we are granted here two contrasting women co-stars that have to be given attention otherwise you miss key movie themes.Action scenes vary from generic to plain idiotic, so we can only hope stunt people attached get granted a hefty sympathy vote towards their next projects.Lastly, the soundtrack. Yes, it actually has one. Again, with contracted time involved, sound engineering must've been stressed to amass most basic of effects, such that during the few tracks played through scenes barely any emotional synchronicity can be found.With minimal scenes, the movies bankable featured actor, actually doesn't do himself any harm, nor favours. Placing Bruce's performance firmly aligned with 'Last Man Standing', just below 'Armageddon'.Overall - A par-boiled and half plucked turkey, that stands a slender chance of being that elusive future un-discovered stars mythical rare gem.",

Your attention is challenged as you try to keep up with a fast pace of visual effects and fill in (with your imagination) the gaps in the screenplay.It has quite alot of funny scenes and dialogues, but not as intentional as they should, and does not cover the over played gravity of the so called \"plot\". Visual effects are so erratical and rushed that watching this movie got me actual headaches.Characters endure the harshness of space and travel through wormwholes dressed in a partially closed suit and with a miracle helmet (I suppose the laws of physics does not apply in this movie).Other gap in logic is the planetary defense of a colonised planet made with one \"loose\" cannon with a big open door that relied on infantery defense.The good thing - it had about 90 minutes.The bad thing - the whole script and the fact that (perhaps) they cut so many things that eventually the movie did not make any sense at all and after you have seen it, you cannot forget it.",

I like Bruce Willis, I love SciFi so I thought this movie would have a bit going for it. How very mistaken I was!I don't think I've cringed this much trying to watch a movie ever. The dialogue was disjointed, screenplay I really think was written by a room full of illiterate monkeys on type writers just mashing keys, the acting was non-existent, the special effects look like they got someone on Fiver to do them (for $5), set design looked like they grabbed everything from a dollar shop and made do.I really think though that it all comes down to the director.... I can only assume that whatever budget was avalible for this film was instead spent of 8kg of blow which the director then spent snorting for the entire duration of making this film, pulled a kid still going to school out of film class to direct for him while he was f@$ked up on blow in his trailer. Whenever the kid had question, the director would just scream out through his closed trailer door between lines that the kid was doing great and just trust the process!I still don't know how this even got out of post production to actually be released.... I think post production likely consisted of a very strung out director stressing he had to deliver ANYTHING to justify the investors money (that he had taken and spent on blow) so did all the post production himself in a single day..... while strung out from all the blow!Maybe there was no blow and it was just a massive brain aneurysm that everyone just overlooked as this movie was nose dived off a cliff....I feel like they should have to pay me to reimburse my time wasted watching this movie.Every single person involved in the making of this movie should take a good hard look in the mirror and ask themselves \"WTF were we doing!\"Don't pay to stream this movie, its a waste of your money.\nDon't download it illegally, its a waste of your internet.\nDon't watch this even if its free, its a monumental waste of your TIME!",

Do not go anywhere near this if you want to retain any sense of fan loyalty.Where to begin??The 'Acting'...oh god Bruce..were you bored throughout, or just didn't care? You look and sound so disinterested. Sad...The 'Aliens'... god that's funny. To begin with they ALL move at the same time with neck twitches...think Michael Jackson's Thriller and you've nailed it! Then they are all dressed like Comicon fans in Assassin's Creed outfits. With masks (convenient cost saving on make-up).The 'Plot'...basically Kill'em All. But from start to finish there are perhaps 15 aliens in total. And the biggest one was killed with 3 pistol rounds.The 'Special Effects'...well, there's a 'SpaceGate' (guess #Stargate was already used?). There's a Kick-A## female soldier carrying an 8ft barrel from a Tiger tank and firing it with ease. There's a secret planetary base for the Orbital Cannon that is lit up like a NightClub in multi-coloured LEDs and has a Military logo projected on it's side (honestly!).The 'Pivotal' scenes... Bruce Willis is led into a cave by multiple Aliens. He has a meeting with someone under bright lights...then walks out later with no-one around?? A 3 minute conversation with a little girl asking if one of the characters can wear her sunglasses is another equally gripping scene.The 'Q-Bomb' Maguffin (from the infinitely better 1959 film -'The Mouse That Roared') ... \"if you drop it you'll wipe out from Earth to Pluto\"...next thing it's getting shot out of a massive cannon over thousands of miles?The 'Slow Motion' scenes... why?..just why?The 'Armoured suits'...made of thin plastic, there to 'protect' them - but then they say to 'self destruct' one? So your armoured suit has a bomb in it as well??The 'Scientist'...so she just stands around while the Aliens slaughter the humans and says 'don't kill them'?The Imperial Guard Tie-Fighter at 41 minutes... WHY?I could go on and on..but I'll summarise.Bruce - take a leaf from your Hard Rock pals Arnold and Sylvester.. Pick better scripts!! It's not about the bottom line. For the sake of your fans and your legacy - avoid piles of #### such as this. We love you as you are! x",

The pressure would have been off them and they could have had a bit more fun with it.Anyway overall a bad film with bad acting (even Bruce has his hammy moments) and a bad storyline, all because of a low budget.I mean, what do you expect?!",

Did I see something more terrible in my whole life? would I see something worse before I die ? I wasn't prepared for such life changing questions.Even the CGI for the alien spaceships were old school, maybe from the mid-eighties.. take one ship.. copy/paste the exact same ship x 50 times and you have the alien army.Because I try to be a positive person, I really hope this movie will help Bruce with his taxes, and maybe enable some of the other actors to pay for acting school.",

I can over look that for the most part though I have seen worse, but the I feel the nail in the coffin for me was the absolute terrible dialog, it felt awkward for most of the movie and alot of the scenes looked like what I could do with my friends when we messed around making movies for fun as kids. On top of that I wanted to see the aliens more and all we got was something that looked like the villans in the old power ranger shows when they attacked. If this was a high budget movie it was a waste of money to make. Definitely listen to the critics and other reviews and skip this one unless you have to see Bruse Willis in everything.",

A bit of a shame really, as it's a classic sci-fi adventure that revolves around exploring an interesting premise.This movie, if turned into a short-fiction novel, would make for a fun Sunday read, even if a bit geeky in nature.Where this movie loses some critics is that it is a low-budget film, with a big-name actor being the only surface-level attraction. If you accept it as a made-for-TV movie rather than a blockbuster, you may be more easily look past its limitations.The premise of the movie is how should terrains, spacefaring humans, react to first contact with a suspected aggressive alien race. Some movies with such a premise play out the notion of humans being being dominated by the aliens and enslaved, which is what critics love to see. This movie takes an aggressive opposing stance, even more so than Ender's Game, and argues for swift action over weakness.\"I was late once and so he broke my nose. I was never late again.\"Geeky Easter eggs exist in the movie, such as the space battleships you see appear to be StarCraft Terran Battlecruisers. It helps to explain the universe without needing to say much at all; something critics would miss.Like most of Bruce Willis movies these days, they run counter to modern liberal norms. I'm giving this movie a 7/10, as there were some cheesy fight scenes and some of the props looked a bit silly. The story was a bit abrupt at times, which might cause issues for viewers that need things spelled out for them, but I didn't have that issue myself.Overall, I enjoyed watching it.",

So the story flies all over the place, and the insane mish-mash of present and far away future features is not doing it any favours. As a movie, I guess its good for a hang-over morning... Press play, and fall asleep once in a while, and watch with half an eye. Thats how much you should invest in this one, because they clearly did not invest enough to make this script coherent and manageable...Bruce Willis career, and him as a person, deserved a better destiny than this... To be used as a commodity and forced into to movies, where he wore an earpiece just to be able to deliver the lines. The people around him saw him as a cash-cow and used him without regret. I wont remember Willis for this, but I will remember him for the Die Hard\u00b4s and The sixth sence.",

Bad writing, bad acting, clingy characters, clingy dialogue, bad and cheap costumes, bad editing, no chemistry between the actors, stupid aliens (why are they so humanoid and why are their face never shown, and if they are so advanced, why don't they have better weapeons than the humans?). Some many things in the movie just don't make sense or seems nonsensical. Like why in 2524 are people still driving cars from the 21st century? Why did the survivors need to walk through the base passing by many soldiers before they could be decontaminated? Why was Bruce's ex wife walking on top of the alien ship and what the heck was that orb thing? There were just so many dumb scenes and god awful dialog. Some of the action scenes seem to be copied from other better movies. If this is the quality of the movies Bruce Willis is doing now that he's in his 60's, I think he shoudl retire.",

The costumes were clearly made of cardboard. Next the camera work and editing were so bad that you couldn't tell who was talking to each other. They were likely being filmed remotely. Finally, characters would just appear like the little girl with sunglasses or the old couple with flannel shirts out of nowhere for no particular reason.  The fight scenes were hilarious. Let's find the cleaning lady and her husband and throw them into the fight with no armor and a gun to get killed then the main guy can fight the aliens off with a knife. \n\nThis movie might become a cult classic just because you can't stop talking about how bad it is.

Every time I backed up, I discovered that I had missed little more than poor dialogue and, what appeared to be a camera person who may have gotten lost on the set. At some point I thought there was something wrong with my brain. The sequences seemed out of order and scenes seemed to actually interrupt the flow of... of progress? No story here. I did find it entertaining that Bruce Willis seems to want to destroy any career he ever had. See Breach for a better understanding. Maybe Bruce is tired and he just wants to be left alone.

It is a hard movie to sit through.  Not only was practically every scenes terribly lit, shot and directed (and shaky) they couldn't be bothered to put names on any of the soldiers dog tags - in several shots you clearly see they are just blank prop dog tags - sure, a small detail but it's just one of many many lazy-factors that continue throughout the entire film.  And I haven't even started on the acting yet. I'm convinced Bruce Willis was doing a favor for a friend, he had to be. Even the other veteran actors were having a hard time keeping a straight face. \n\nThere is absolutely no redeeming features of this film. Not one.

Spacesuits that look like they were designed by high school students. (Not even.) Totally whacked timelines. Disjointed storyline. Ridiculous body armour. And on and on.\n\nWrap all this up neatly with the clause Bruce Willis seemingly has in his acting contract that he won't go over 80 words of dialogue in a movie. (Nice to get millions for a number of words you could easily write on your forearm, which most likely he does.)\n\nOne of the two writers on this catastrophe actually acted in it, doubling down on his professional setback. Masochism at its finest.\n\nOddly enough even thespian talents like Wayne Gretzky and Tommy Lees' sons aren't enough to save this chunk of mouldy cinematic cheese. Go figure.\n\nApparently, Netflix is more than happy to throw in ANYTHING to feed its streaming content grinder which we witness on a daily basis.\n\nPS... The 1-star rating was only earned due to an annoying housefly who was watching this movie with me having to end its existence from sheer dread halfway through by crashing into the screen like a Word War 2 Japanese kamikaze pilot.

This is about a group of rogue soldiers launching a preemptive strike to try and stop an intergalactic war before it starts.  Now I didn't know much about this one other than it the fact that it is the latest in the series of movies where Bruce Willis shows up to collect a paycheck.  Needless to say, I did not have high expectations for this, and the fact that this is currently rated lower on IMDb than Hard Kill made me assume I was in for the worst.  You can already make an educated guess for yourself on where this is going, and there is no point in pretending otherwise: there is nothing here to recommend.  Now I knew that I was in trouble as soon as this started.  They give you a rundown of CENTURIES of science fiction lore within the opening minute like you know what they are referencing.  You can tell that somebody clearly had big ideas at some point in this process, but you can also tell that the majority of this budget had to have gone to Bruce Willis.  This is what his career has become.  It's not like you have to pay for an advertisement budget here.  This and majority of his recent library exist solely for people browsing Redbox or scrolling a streaming service, and when they happen upon his face, they'll say, \"Hey, I like Bruce Willis.\"  He's sleepwalking through this, and at this point in his career, that is all you're likely going to get from him.  All of the actors here are amateurish at best with the one exception of Frank Grillo, and even he doesn't walk away from this looking good since he gets no energy reciprocated back to him.  Because all of the production money went to Bruce Willis, every aspect of this movie ends up looking cheap.  The war suits look like garbage cans, and you don't get a good look at the alien threat until the midpoint.  For a while there, I thought that they exist entirely off-screen when they aren't pulling the cheap option of having aliens mind control humans.  That would have been a better call to make because when you finally do get to see the enemy, they are just faceless men in hoodies, which is just comical.  Much like all of the characters here, this is a movie that has no personality.  You don't get to know what any of these people are about other than the fact that Bruce Willis committed war crimes, and all of the actors are just going through the motions.  I can't blame them since this script is nothing but a collection of clich\u00e9s.  I am not exaggerating when I say that the phone app for Star Realms has a better story with their opening preludes than what they put together here.  Cosmic Sin never offended me to the point of being angry, but it did offend my sense of taste.  You should go out of your way to actively avoid this.",

The VFX were scattered and too low budget for what this film claimed to be. The gun fights looked as though they couldn't afford even the better simulated muzzle flashes. The dialogue is stilted and awkward, and written by someone who thinks it looks good on paper, therefore translates to reality. Even the AI interjects countless lines throughout the movie, with very little of it making sense. The storyline left huge gaps in credulity, leaves the audience feeling as though they were cheated out of a proper story. There was an extreme lack of continuity, and scenes that had no meaning, or if the meanings were hidden, I'm sure the smugly smiling writers didn't even know really. The characters actions were pantomimed and lackadaisical, with several scenes making us think they were working for the other side through their sheer inability to just friggin do SOMETHING with the clear and imminent danger.",
