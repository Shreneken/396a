            "content": "This movie was shot in May 2019 just a few months before the COVID-19 pandemic was recognized. The writer-director says he wrote this with Anthony Hopkins, who was 81, in mind. The movie has a number of well established actors but the story's impact depends on Hopkins and he achieves this as very few might be able to do.Usually movies dealing with aging and dementia depict it from the points of view of all the others around, friends, family members, medical personnel. This does the opposite, it depicts it from the point of view of the afflicted person. As such I found myself totally confused after about 20 minutes but eventually understood why it had to be this way. We are seeing what Anthony (character's name) sees and experiences, the confusion as to where he is and his failure to recognize people he knows.In many ways this is a hard movie to watch because we know people who have gone through dementia and its inevitable end, or know people who are in the early stages of it. For that reason my wife chose not to watch this movie.For the subject matter it is a very good movie.",

            "content": "This movie brings you inside the mind of someone losing their memories and recognition of those around them. In another genre, what happens here could just as well take place in a horror film. The fascinating thing about the story as it unfolds is that as the viewer, there comes a point where you begin to question whether what you're seeing is what the principal character is experiencing, or whether it's a figment of Anthony's (Anthony Hopkins) imagination. The distinction between his reality and the reveries that make up his daily existence sort of blend together in a way that confound the senses. Hopkins is extraordinary in the role, and if this is his last chance to earn an Oscar for Best Actor, then it's a darn good one in a field with some significant competition. Olivia Colman as Anthony's struggling daughter expresses all the concern and frustration that comes with being the primary caregiver for her dementia stricken father, and there are somber moments in the picture when you want to cry along with her over the hopelessness of both his and her situation. As a harbinger of what might happen to anyone as we all approach those senior twilight years, the film can be a depressing experience, only somewhat mitigated by the care and concern that dedicated health care workers are able to provide in an institutional setting. As tender and comforting as the closing scene is, it's one that will break the heart of anyone who's been through a similar experience.",

            "content": "This is one of the hardest movie reviews I've ever had to write in my life.Mainly because of the films subject matter, Dementia.I've seen my own father succumb to this dreaded disease and it scares the hell out of my, worse than any horror movie I've watched.I sadly remember some of the last words my own father spoke to me were, \"Be a good boy at School today.\"\nI was 46 at the time.The beauty of \"The Father\" is how Director, Florian Zeller, takes you into this descent of losing your grip on reality through the eyes of the marvellous veteran and Academy Award wining actor, Sir Anthony Hopkins.At times his character Anthony is part Hannibal Lecter and at others a peaceful, but confused ageing Father to Olivia Colmans, Anne.Another Academy Award winner who puts in a highly believable performance as his daughter who's trying to deal with helping a man who refuses to accept assistance from her or carers.Fun Fact: Colman was named Anne is both roles she's been Oscar nominated for.Also great supporting roles form Mark Gatiss, Olivia Williams, Imogen Poots and Rufus Sewell.Overall \"The Father\" has been nominated for 6 Oscars, after already having over 20 wins in other awards and once you've seen this film you'll know why it deserves to win in Hollywood.At 83, Hopkins, is the oldest winner of a Best Male Actor BAFTA and a dark horse to scoop up the big one.This film feels like everything he has learnt in his craft is on display effortlessly for 97 minutes.It's hard to believe this is Zellers' feature film directorial debut, because it's a masterclass in cinema adapted from his own acclaimed play \"Le Pere\" from 2012.The role of Anthony was specifically written for Hopkins.One of the things that got the living legend to agree to this film apart from the top shelf script (adapted by Christopher Hampton) was the inclusion of one of Hopkins favourite pieces of music from Georges Bizet Opera \"The Pearl Fishers\".He's always dreamt of making a movie with this music in it.With lines from Anthony like: \"I feel as if I'm losing all my leaves\" \"The Father\" is so close to perfect I'm giving it 10 stars.",

            "content": "I cannot say what I want to say about this film without spoilers, so please don't read on if you want to find what happens in the film as it unfolds.Anthony lives in a flat in London. His daughter Anne calls in on him every day. She is upset and worried because Anthony has driven away another care worker, and Anne is about to move to Paris in a new relationship. Anne's husband indicates that the flat is Anne's, not Anthony's. Anne seems to be an entirely different person,, but then she is Anne again. Her husband is someone different though. Some conversations are repeated. Anthony initially charms, then verbally attacks, Laura, a potential new care worker who reminds him of his other daughter, Lucy, who never comes to see him.We realise early on that Anthony is in the grip of dementia, and through most of the piece, right up to the end, we are wondering hiw much of what we see is real, and how much is Anthony's disintegrating memory betraying him. Ultimately, we never know and it doesn't matter - despite it being very clear how destructive the impact of Anthony's dementia is on Anne (and possibly her busband - was she married? Was it a factor in the marriage breaking up?), what the film shows us is what it might be like inside the mind of someone whose foothold in the real world is increasingly unreliable.Anthony Hopkins wins a well-deserved 2nd Best Actor Oscar for a portrayal of a character who is initially unlikeable but, by the end, is almost literally a little lost boy. The rest of the cast are also excellent.Florian Zeller directs this adaptation of his own play (the adapted screenplay also won an Oscar). It is wise, sad, accurate and compassionate. If you and your family have never been touched by dementia then you may well marvel at the clever and kind telling of a worthwhile story, brought to life by a crew of supremely gifted artists.My family has been touched by dementia on a number of occasions.At different times, I saw in this film my grandparents, my mother-in-law, my wife, my father, my mother, my brother and myself, and all at times in our lives which could never be called happy. It struck very close to home, and I found it brutal.",

            "content": "I haven't seen the play on which \"The Father\" is based, (or indeed the other two plays in Florian Zeller's trilogy on the family), but as cinematic adaptations go this is as good as it gets. Taking place almost entirely on a single set, this is an actor's piece of the highest order and its linchpin is a magnificent performance from Anthony Hopkins as \"The Father\" of the title, a man suffering from advanced dementia and perhaps, both in Hopkins's performance and Zeller's treatment of the subject, this will come to be seen as the definitive film on dementia as anyone with personal experience can testify.Everything is seen through Hopkins' eyes. Olivia Coleman, (heartbreakingly good), is his daughter but there are other 'characters' who may or may not exist or rather, if they do exist, who are they or who does Hopkins perceive them to be? A man appears who says he's the daughter's husband but then the daughter has said she does not have a husband. Another woman comes in and says she's his daughter while another man appears and converses with Hopkins. Is he the husband? Is there a husband?I've already said that this is an actor's piece of the first order but it is also a writer's piece with Zeller adapting his own play with Christopher Hampton. It may be mystifying initially for just as characters turn up to confuse us so the film follows no chronological timespans. Events keep repeating themselves if they happen at all until we come to realise we are simply inside Hopkins' dishevelled mind and for Hopkins I think I can safely say that this is a career- best performance. The Oscar givers may ignore it but acting like this deserves more than prizes; it deserves to be seen.",

However, to Anthony everything is confusion: faces change, one day his daughter Anne is moving to Paris, the next day she's not, is this his flat or not?

An absorbing, sensitive-yet-jarring look into what a person living with dementia or similar must go through plus what those that love them and care for them must experience. Told in a very intriguing and compelling manner: nothing is signposted, everything unfolds in a layered altered-reality fashion, making you figure things out for yourself.Quite haunting and thought-provoking, as that could be you one day, or someone you love. Incredibly emotional too as you think about this affects his loved ones, the life he's lived and that this is what it now amounts to.Incredible performance by Anthony Hopkins in the lead role. While the plot and direction are fantastic the film needed an excellent performance as Anthony and that's what Hopkins does, absolutely nailing it.

            "content": "The Father couldn't be more realistic when talking about Alzheimer's disease. I've seen my grandfather walking that path. He was a smart man but once the dementia kicked in he was barely recognizable, which was a hard thing to witness when you knew him as the intellectual he was. The Father just nailed this subject, bringing back so many memories, memories we would rather forget but that you can't. Living with a loved one with this disease isn't easy at all, certainly not when that person sometimes doesn't remember who you are. I didn't knew Anthony Hopkins won an Oscar for his role, but after watching this movie I can only say it's highly deserved. It's probably one of his better performances ever, and that at 83 years old. The Father isn't a movie that will give you a lot of joy, it's sad and scary but certainly worth watching. Nobody wants to have a loved one suffering from dementia, it's a nightmare to live with. I remember my grandfather starting to smoke a cigarette like it was a thing he always did and that whilst he stopped more than forty years ago. I remember him telling me he was going crazy after asking me the same question for the twentieth time in barely an hour. He knew it was all going downhill, he knew he was a burden to everybody, and that must hurt when you are still that little bit lucid to understand that. I watched several movies about dementia but this one is just the most realistic. It's sad but that's life, everybody should watch it so they can be prepared if the disease ever would hit a loved one.",

            "content": "One of my all time favorite movies is Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche, New York which narrates the ever deteriorating world around a playwright bordering on reality and insanity. And Florian Zeller's The Father is the closest I've seen that captures the insanity of the decaying mind, but told through the apparatus of a very real and universal issue.The movie was unsettling from start to finish... in the best way possible. It's one that shows the unstable world around the aging Anthony, but with the underlying vigilance that what's \"wrong\" is not necessarily the world around him. And the horror of one's rationality clinging on to his very last bit of sanity is shown in the most surprisingly human way possible, and it's what makes The Father one of the finest movies of the year.Special credits to stars Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman, who undoubtedly make the movie as every bit emotional and human. And Hopkins' performance in this movie is by far my favorite of the year. Overall, a very intense yet rewarding viewing experience that no one should miss out on. Do yourselves a favor and check it out!!!",

            "review_title": "Demented Puzzle",
            "content": "Dementia is a terrible disease. It's not something I'm interested in seeing depicted on screen. I've already seen enough of that. \"Amour\" (2012), with it likewise being claustrophobically isolated to an apartment and although it involves a stroke, especially comes to mind. Anticipating it was a depressingly realistic slice-of-life drama, I wasn't enthusiastic about seeing this Awards-winner, \"The Father,\" from a playwright turned first-time movie director. Fortunately and surprisingly, I don't think it's that, and one would be well advised to see it before reading reviews for it, including this one. I'm not familiar with the writer-director's original play that this is an Anglicization of, \"Le P\u00e8re,\" nor the French film already made of it, \"Floride\" (2015), so I don't know how much of it was always of design or if anything is original here. I mean, \"they don't even speak English there.\" Regardless, that \"The Father\" may come across as what I feared it was--and what others seem to discuss it as--is because we may forget genres when introduced to their entries in unpredictable ways. But, remember, \"The Father\" is a mind-game film, a puzzle picture.Think \"Fight Club,\" \"The Matrix\" (both 1999), \"A Beautiful Mind\" (2001), \"Shutter Island\" (2010), Charlie Kaufman, David Lynch, Christopher Nolan--movies that play games and are puzzles to put together. My go-to essay on this type of movie is \"The Mind-Game Film\" by Thomas Elsaesser. It lists six common motifs among such titles. I've already done this in my review of \"The Machinist\" (2004), but as remembered repetition is especially the name of the game in this case, I'll run through the list again, of which \"The Father,\" with its congruent case of dementia, may be diagnosed as checking every box. 1) the protagonist is involved in events whose meaning or consequences escape him. 2) He's mistaken about the difference between reality and his imagination and so are we. 3) He has imaginary friends. 4) He has an identity crisis--asking \"who am I and what is my reality?\" 5) He's not only unable to distinguish between different worlds, but is also not aware their might be parallel universes, nor are we, until the ultimate reveal. 6) He's persuaded by others that he's deluded, particularly as regards a child and past trauma.The novelty of \"The Father\" is that we know he has dementia, so when the picture is put into his perspective, we know present reality and memories might be mixed up, although it may still be difficult to distinguish. This is further complicated by briefly taking the point of view of the daughter or of the camera sharing subjectivity with no particular character. The greatest trick of all here being that the spectator might not even realize what kind of movie this is. It's all there, though, in its non-linear jigsaw puzzle of reality and illusion, past and present, one's own identity and those of others. Actors playing different roles depending on his confusion. The business with the other daughter. Clever stuff. I also like the allusions on the margins to other arts in painting and music, as well as that this maze of a mind comes from a retired engineer, or was he a dancer, or circus performer. And what wonderful use of its limited setting--as if everything takes place in an ever-changing flat. Despite what that would suggest and that it's an adaptation of a play, this isn't stagy at all. Well edited and photographed, too.The only other movie that comes to mind that deals this smartly with dementia is \"Still Alice\" (2014). In that case, it was reflexively about literature (implicitly \"Alice in Wonderland\") and acting. As there, with actors switching between characters, and back and forth in identity, it's vital that the performances be top notch. Fortunately, then, \"The Father\" stars Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman in Oscar-winning and Oscar-nominated roles, respectively, as well as a capable supporting cast. Olivia Williams is especially well cast, including for passing similarities in appearance to Colman. There's too much mental misery and the hardships of aging in the outside world, so don't forget this is a movie.",

            "review_title": "Towering Performance",
            "content": "Anthony Hopkins gives a towering performance and joined the ranks of multi-Oscar winning actors in this harrowing film.He plays an elderly man suffering from dementia, and the movie is filmed mostly from his point of view, meaning it's a disorienting experience for the viewer, as past runs into present runs into future, different actors play the same characters and then the same actors show up later playing different characters, the apartment in which he lives changes decor and layout. We're never sure whether we're getting an accurate version of events, and the last and devastating scene of the film leaves us wondering if anything that preceded it happened within the world of the movie at all or whether it was all a jumble of memories of events that occurred before the film even starts.The film is expertly written and directed in such a way to make it just frustrating enough for us to feel like we're in the shoes of the main character, but not too frustrating to make the movie overall a turn off. Given its accolades, I was surprised and maybe a touch disappointed that I wasn't more moved by it than I was, save for that last scene, which would have justified Hopkins' Academy Award even if nothing else leading up to it did, though everything leading up to it does as well.Christopher Hampton and Florian Zeller (who also directed) won an Oscar for adapting the screenplay from Zeller's play, and this is one stage-to-screen adaptation that doesn't scream its stage origins. I wasn't surprised it was based on a play, but on the other hand would have accepted that it was written directly for the screen too. Olivia Colman received a Best Supporting Actress nomination for playing Hopkins' daughter, or at least one iteration of her, while the film also copped nominations for Best Picture, Best Production Design (and how wonderful to see work like this nominated in a category that usually favors obvious period or fantasy films), and Best Film Editing (again, a very high-brow choice by the Academy, and richly deserved).Grade: A.",

            "content": "Anthony (Anthony Hopkins) is elderly and living in his flat. His daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) keeps dropping by to check he is OK. But is this right? Strange things keep happening to him, from losing his watch to having strange people turn up at the flat. For Anthony is battling against dementia, and reality and fantasy are not quite as distinct as they once were.Positives:\nI was one of those disappointed that Chadwick Boseman didn't posthumously win the Best Actor Oscar for \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\". But, boy oh boy, after seeing this I am fully supportive of the Academy's position. Anthony Hopkins has delivered some astonishingly powerful performances during his career - from the tortured ventriloquist in \"Magic\", to Hannibal Lector to the elderly pope in \"The Two Popes\". But he really excels himself here, tapping both your emotions and your sympathies as the confused and terrified old man.The Oscar- and BAFTA-winning screenplay by Florian Zeller, based on his stage play, is devastating, subtly twisting the knife. It will be particularly telling/upsetting for those who are getting on in years and/or have/had elderly parents affected by dementia. I would personally not have included (being deliberately vague) the \"Williams entry\" scene in the trailer, since it is a jolt of a twist in the film. But there are so many other clever devices in the screenplay that you don't see coming. The ending in particular is brutal on the emotions.The production design (an Oscar nomination for Peter Francis and Cathy Featherstone) is ingenious, as the set subtly and progressively transforms. Almost a 'spot the difference' in movie form.The score by Ludovico Einaudi uses atonal strings to great effect, as Anthony's reality keeps shifting from under him.Negatives:\nI've nothing here, hence my 10/10 rating. I've seen some reviews that have thought that the movie was too \"stagey\" (which is a criticism I have levelled before at a bunch of \"stage to screen\" adaptations such as \"Fences\" and - more recently - \"One Night in Miami\" and \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\"). But I really didn't feel that way about \"The Father\". The claustrophobic nature of the plot was well served I thought by the (largely) single set location.Summary Thoughts on \"The Father\": Dementia is a cruel and heartless disease that robs any affected elderly person of their memories, logic and - ultimately - their dignity. I thought the movie was extremely clever in reflecting this decline, anchored by the astonishing career-best performance from Sir Anthony Hopkins. But this in turns makes this a very hard watch indeed!(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. There is also a new onemannsmovies Tiktok channel.

Not only does it give you the perspective of a mind that has devolved into dementia, it creatively immerses you in their moment-to-moment thoughts and experiences through the repeating confusing scenes, changing context, strange faces, disappearing furniture, etc. Now who could convincingly portray an old man who has lost his mind through an acting performance that showcases the opposite of dementia? None other than Sir Anthony Hopkins! Here, we have this veteran actor at 82 years old who could very well be a victim of dementia himself at that ripe old age. Instead, he is firing at all cylinders, giving us this heartwarming performance of a lifetime making us convinced that he really has dementia, but the act of doing so just proves he is at the top of his game with elite-level acting. Who would've thought that after 30 years of his legendary Hannibal Lecter, he would top himself with this one? I look forward to more Anthony Hopkins films to come!",

Sir Anthony Hopkins delivers a magisterial performance as a man suffering from dementia and occasionally recognizing that he is a prisoner in his own mind.The central, heartfelt relationship in the film is that of the old man and his daughter Anne. At times, Anthony treats her badly, and the filmmakers deftly deliver the experience of a daughter struggling to cope as she contemplates sending her father to a nursing home.The fragmented way in which the narrative and characterizations shift gives the audience an experience of a crumbling mind. Anthony confuses names and details as he desperately seeks an answer to the question, \"Who am I?\"It wasn't entirely clear if the filmmakers wanted to depict an experience of elder abuse, as the two men who were in the flat as Anne's \"husband\" would berate and even physically assault Anthony. Still, Hopkins is successful in carrying the film by evoking a Shakespearean figure of tragedy. It is quite simply an unforgettable character portrait.",

Some felt that Chadwick Bosman was meant to get it. Chadwick Bosman surely deserved an Oscar - but the outrage was way too late and not really helping anyone. Chadwick would have deserved an Oscar for his performance in the \"Get up\" movie (his James Brown personification was ... just awesome and spot on), but everyone who was against the decision, must not have seen the Father. Because Anthony Hopkins is just so good in it, there is no doubt he deserved this Oscar he got.Now I hope you are still with me. Because while I did hightlight the main performance (rightfully so I might add myself), the other \"supporting\" actors (no pun intended) and the story plus the way the movie is edited, help elevate this to a degree that make this a great movie overall. You will be baffled too - where does this go, what is real, what actually happens or rather happened. I think this may be - no actually I would go as far as to say, that this is one of the best depictions of the illness put on film. You are right there with the person who can't remember - or remembers bits and pieces. Sometimes not the right things ... really devestating and painful ... especially for those around the person who is ill. It takes a lot of work and patience to deal with a situation like that.Kudos to everyone involved - and while this is a movie from 2020 apparently, it probably will make my top 10 of 2022, since I just watched it.

            "content": "\"Why do you keep looking as if there's something wrong? Everything's fine.\"The Father follows a man suffering from memory problems as he refuses all assistance from his daughter as he ages. As he tries to make sense of his changing circumstances, he begins to doubt his loved ones, his own mind and even the fabric of his reality. I honestly don't know where to begin. This is a mind-bender for the ages. Florian Zeller adapted his play into a screenplay along with Christopher Hampton. Naturally, Zeller also directed the film as well. Had he not collaborated on this project, I don't think it would ever be the same. He brought so much to this through his writing and directing. The way he made this confusing for both the viewers and Anthony (Anthony Hopkins' character) only enhances the experience. The first 30 minutes had me questioning everything I was watching. More questions are answered as the film continues but not in the most conventional way. We have to piece everything together. Any when I say everything I mean literally everything. Characters, timelines, location, just everything. It's not till the last moments where absolutely everything comes together in a way that makes sense. The screenplay is strong in the sense of storytelling, though a little bit of clarity would've been nice at a couple parts, but the dialogue is even stronger. The scenes that Anthony Hopkins are in-and it's basically every scene-he has hefty monologues. Every single scene is an award winning scene for both the actors, writing, and directing. Zeller directs the hell out of every scene. He gets the most out of the actors through expression and blocking. I find that those who have worked with stage production, whether it's writing or directing, have a way of knowing how to send a message through the screen. I know the awards shows don't favor stage-to-screen directing as much but I hope Zeller can pull through.Now if Anthony Hopkins doesn't win almost every award for his role, I'm going to be furious. If he doesn't win the Oscar it might go down as one of the biggest snubs in history. The only exception would be if Chadwick Boseman wins and it seems that they are going to campaign him in lead instead of supporting now. Hopkins goes through every emotion possible and takes the viewers with him. And like I said before, every scene he's in jail an award worthy scene. The very last scene had my pillow soaked in tears. The realistic acting and dialogue immersed you into the film and you forget this is acting. The same can be said for Olivia Colman. It's funny how she didn't become a household name until The Favourite. Now there's another chance she will get another Oscar. That is if she can beat Glen Close a second time. We, assuming you don't have severe memory problems, can associate with her character the most. She just wants what's best for her father but struggles to deal with his condition every day. Almost al of her scenes are heavy with emotional dialogue. Emotional doesn't always mean sad or angry, but the emotion put in to make the performance realistic is always evident. The rest of the cast does great as well. They don't have that much screen time, with the exception of Imogen Poots, but they use every minute they have. Speaking of Imogen Poots, I love to see how much she's grown as an actress. Every role keeps getting better and better. If she wasn't in the shadow of Colman, she very well could have a fair shot for awards nominations.It's hard to express words for The Father. It's been over a week since I watched it and I still can't stop thinking about it. Once it finished I considered watching it again. Even though I had three classes the next day, I should've watched it again. Time flies by so fast while watching. What felt like 30 minutes turned out to be an hour. But it's the use of time that's done so well. Both in the sense of runtime and the time in the film, the execution couldn't have been better. When this comes out, whether it's in theaters or online, please, please, please watch The Father!",

            "content": "How does one respond when they cannot know reality? This is the main question of the Father.The Father is adapted from director Florian Zeller's stage play by the same name. The story centers on Anthony (Anthony Hopkins), an aging man who slowly loses his grip on reality due to dementia. His daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) does her best to care for him, but she too has a life she wants to live-her boyfriend Paul (Rufus Sewell) has asked her to move to Paris with him. Anne struggles to find an aid who can handle her father, so that she can get on with her life. Zeller shared that his inspiration for the film was watching his grandmother, who raised him, pass away from dementia. You can feel the emotion coming through every part of the film.The movie starts with Anne confronting Anthony for chasing off the last assistant. Anthony claims he did it because she stole his watch. Anne patiently reminds him that he put it in his hiding place. She goes and finds the watch in his \"secret\" hiding place. At first, we are able to chuckle about the situation, but we soon become just as confused as Anthony. The tone of the movie shifts when Anthony stumbles upon a man in his flat who claims to be married to his daughter. He waits for Anne to return from the store to sort things out, but when she arrives, she is a different woman entirely.The rest of film has confusing moments like this. Once you think you have sorted things out, they are flipped again. I watched this at the premier at Sundance, and during the Q & A after the film, a woman asked if Anne went to Paris with Paul or not. Zeller responded that we don't know that answer, the answer is not what is important. Zeller stated that he wanted us to be as confused as Anthony and give up on trying to sort things out and just feel. And feel we do.Anthony Hopkins performance drove the emotion. His masterful control of minor expressions and vocal nuance intensified the whole film. I would not be surprised if he wins best actor next year. Zeller admitted that he named the character \"Anthony,\" because he wanted Anthony Hopkins to play the part. (The part was literally written for him.) Anthony's emotions swing in the film driven by his loss of memory and disorientation to events. Everyone seems to be on edge, not knowing how Anthony will respond. One moment he is happy, the next he is distressed. This comes out strongly when Anthony meets Laura (Imogen Poots) for the first time. Laura is a young woman who Anne has set up as Anthony's new caregiver. Anthony begins telling Laura how he used to be a tap-dancer. The scene is funny, and Laura laughs throughout. Suddenly, Anthony remarks that Laura reminds him of his other daughter, because of her inane laughter-and the mood has swung.The key question in the audiences mind is \"What is reality?\" Zeller disorients Anthony and the audience by having different actors play the same characters, then switching back. Zeller rearranges the same apartment, so we are unsure where we are-Anthony's apartment or Anne's. Anthony tells different versions of his career, and we even seem to experience events out of order. The only thing we are certain of is that they don't even speak English in Paris!This is not to say that there are multiple realities, but that Anthony cannot access what the true reality is. As the audience, we become like Anthony-confused. We do not know what his daughter looks like or if she is married. If she is, which man is her husband? However, this confusion over reality is meant to push us beyond discovering the truth and just feeling the helplessness of someone suffering from dementia. And to this point, it works.But, it takes us beyond this. By the end of the film we are all confused. We cannot access what reality is, and now it is time for us to ask, \"How do we respond?\" The film has its answer, but I'll leave it up to you to feel if you agree. This is one film that has to be watched to appreciate, because it focuses on the feeling of the experience and not the truth of the experience.A couple extra notes:\nFirst, Zeller shared that the classical music that Anthony listens to throughout the film is Hopkins's favorite music. Hopkins always wanted to be in a movie that used this music, and now he got the chance.Second, often movies adapted from stage plays can feel very confined and unnatural to the screen. Events that would naturally lead a character elsewhere seems to falsely confine them to that space, since the play needs to keep them there. However, Zeller does a nice job at expanding the world and making the small space feel new. Most of the film takes place in the apartment, but because of the rearrangement and use of different rooms in the apartment, it feels larger and natural.",

It started with little things. He'd 'lose' his wallet. A couple of times he'd take the cash from Ma's purse and 'lose' it. He had worked as a plumber. One day I went to visit him. As I opened the front door I smelt gas. There was dad,in the front room with a stripped out gas fire,about to use a blow torch. That was the day Ma told me she couldn't cope and so I moved back home to help look after him. Slowly he got worse. He'd go out early in the morning for walks. Sometimes in just his underwear. Once he managed to leave the house and we ended up having to call the Police. They found him. I started staying awake most nights to watch him. I was already an insomniac. Watching him change from my dad into someone who didn't know me was difficult. The Dr's told Ma that dad needed to go into a 'care' home. We had to have him 'committed'. I have always regretted that. He was visited everyday whilst in the 'care' home. When he was living at home I had given up my job to care for dad and so I could spend several hours with him daily. We'd go for walks. Have a fish & chips lunch. By this time I was almost a stranger to him. Occasionally he'd think I was his brother. Though he always spoke of the sons who never bothered to visit him. Ma would quite often have to buy dad a new watch as he'd 'lose' them. The hardest part of this cruel disease for us was that dad,like the man in this film,had forgotten that his daughter had been killed in a traffic accident 20 years before. He'd often ask where she was. We never told him the truth. There were times when he became violent(something the illness seemed to bring out in him). Sometimes dad would have a lucid moment. It always surprised me when he called me by my name. Those were the times that became really special to me. I'd ask him questions about his life. Those moments only lasted a few mins. I used to wonder what dad would say if,during a lucid moment,I had shown him a video of the man he had become. I'm fairly certain he'd have asked me to put him out of his misery. He was always a very proud man.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Dementia and Alzheimer's disease are frequent topics in movies these days for the simple reason that so many are impacted either directly or through a friend or family member. The importance of memory to our core being cannot be over-stated. It's crucial to who we are and what we feel. The first feature film from French director Florian Zeller is an excellent and poignant tale, all too real for those who have experienced this with a loved one. Zeller adapted his own play (winning a Tony Award for Frank Langella) with his co-writer, Oscar winner Christopher Hampton (DANGEROUS LIASONS, 1988). It's also one of the few films where Set Design is so crucial that it basically serves as a main character.Whereas most of these movies provide the perspective of the caregiver or family members, this one is extraordinary in also giving us the point-of-view of the one suffering. Sir Anthony Hopkins (Oscar winner, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, 1991) plays Anthony, an 80 year old Londoner who gets hurt, defensive and a bit churlish when his daughter Anne (Oscar winner Olivia Colman, THE FAVOURITE, 2018) informs him that she's met a man and is moving to Paris. Anne is working to find an acceptable caregiver for her father ... one that he doesn't run off in a matter of hours. Though Anne maintains a spirited front, it's clear the responsibility is exhausting and draining - feelings of which any caregiver can surely relate.Just about the time we get a feel for the flow and settle in for a family drama, filmmaker Zeller spins things topsy-turvy. We suddenly aren't sure 'what is what' or 'who is who'. Olivia Williams (THE SIXTH SENSE, 1999) is now Anne. She now has a husband, Paul - maybe Mark Gatiss or Rufus Sewell. The details of the apartment are slightly different, and instead of being Anthony's place, it's actually Anne's. Or is it? Anthony tries to process these differences, just as we do. The interview with an in-home caregiver played by Imogen Poots brings out the joy and liveliness of Anthony, but a painting raises questions ... as does the ongoing saga with Anthony's favorite wristwatch. As viewers, we are baffled and disoriented; however, unlike Anthony, we are slowly able to process the flashes of data and slowly put the pieces together.Anthony Hopkins delivers his best and most emotional work in years, while Olivia Colman continues her impressive run. In fact, the entire cast his spot on. Complementing the performances is Peter Francis' previously mentioned Set Design, which adds to both the confusion and the explanation. Also elevating the film is the work of Film Editor Yorgos Lamprinos and the score from Ludovico Einaudi. Hopkins' character asks, \"Who exactly am I?\" and we feel the excruciating pain of realizing one's persona is slipping away. This will be a challenging film to watch for anyone who has experienced this type of agonizing loss in their life, and Zeller's film also serves as a warning to everyone else.\nOpening theatrically nationwide March 12th and available for Premium VOD on March 26th\"",

The dizzying disorientation of losing one's grip on basic reality, the loss of dignity, and the vulnerability associated having dementia are portrayed here in a stunning way, with the film giving us enough of the perspective of an old man to truly feel his horror. At the same time it allows us to follow what's really going on, with one of his daughter's struggling to get proper care for him and dealing with her own emotions as well. In a cruel twist of fate, she was never his favorite daughter but ended up being his caregiver, and he no longer possesses the tact to stop talking about her sister. Argh, this one just tears at the heartstrings, especially if you've gone through a situation like this personally.As noted pretty much everywhere, Anthony Hopkins turns in a brilliant performance, really humanizing this character and in small ways reminding us that he once led a highly respectable life. In some of the more poignant moments he attempts to put on a brave face, make jokes, or even flirt with the caregivers, trying to appear as dashing as he remembers he once was, when those around him feel uneasy and awkward. The shame of playing the fool and worse yet, being a burden to loved ones, is tough to watch and even tougher to imagine possibly experiencing firsthand someday. Director Florian Zeller keeps us off-balance and wisely doesn't try to give us a completely objective version of events, because that isn't the point. The film is also well-paced, and well-timed at 97 minutes.",

            "content": "All I knew when I started watching this movie was it was about an old-man whose mind was failing, and I was expecting a standard drama on the subject, affecting and serious, powered by Hopkin's inexhaustible talent. Hopkins is what I expected, brilliant as an irascible and increasingly confused old man. His final moments are brutal and brilliant. The rest of the cast is excellent as well. But the film itself is not a straightforward drama, but something much more remarkable.*********** SPOILERS BELOW ******************\nWhat is remarkably about this film is how it takes you into Hopkins failing mind. The first scene is a straightforward one of a cantankerous, independent old man interacting with his exhausted daughter. But in the next scene, there are weird shifts and disorienting moments. That's when you realize we are experiencing reality, for the most part, as Hopkins is experiencing it. Settings and faces change, time loops in on itself. It's often unclear if we are re-experiencing a moment or reaching a new one.The timeline is an unsolvable puzzle. There are contradictions that can't be resolved. It's unclear is everything we see happened, and almost certain it didn't happen in the way we're shown. Hopkins is unmoored, and as he declines, you see his increasing caution as he begins to realize that he's been wrong so often that he needs to be careful in what he says. But then he's often not careful because he is who he is.This is from a play, but unlike most movies from plays, I wouldn't have guessed that. It's opened up beautifully, as Hopkins drifts from one location to another, never quite sure where he is. I'd be very curious to know how this was originally staged.The playwright directed this, and I am really curious what he'll do next. This is a truly remarkable, must-see film.",

            "content": "I had the wonderful opportunity to see The Father at CIFF this year. I went in excited to see what Sir Anthony Hopkins would do with a study on dementia. As I consider Sir Anthony as arguable the best actor in film these days I had pretty high expectations. And I was not at all let down. When his character, also named Anthony, become confused or curmudgeonly you recognize some of his other great performances. But in fact I was most impressed at how warm and charming of a character Sir Anthony could also play. He was just simply spell binding when his character was his \"old self\". With all this being said perhaps the most remarkable performance of the film comes from Olivia Colman who plays Anthony's daughter, Anne. The patience, frustration, hurt and unwavering love depicted while Anne tries to find the best way to care for her father is truly remarkable. I'm sure there will be Oscar buzz for both of these performances and for the adapted screen play of Director Florian Zeller.\nNow a little SPOILER to help people better enjoy this film. The Father in a way is shot like a mystery. Time lines are repeated , characters change in the story all while the audience sits confused. You do by the end understand that this is done to represent the progression of Anthony's disease. And you as an audience get to experience the strangeness of a mind that is being let down by itself. This is presented as a kind of plot twist. But I think the film will be more enjoyable for most if you understand in advance what is going on.",

            "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I've watched some incredible films during my life. Some offered me a blast of pure entertainment, others left me crying like a baby, and dozens made me laugh uncontrollably. Nevertheless, the most memorable movies are the ones that profoundly impact me emotionally either by remembering me of a past phase of my life or by possessing main characters who I can strongly relate to. What might be \"just another film\" for most viewers can ultimately become a personal journey for other people in the audience, which is how I partially experienced The Father. I didn't have massive expectations for the movie itself, but I was curious to know how great Anthony Hopkins would be.While the legendary actor is undoubtedly a notable standout, Florian Zeller's creative, unconventional storytelling left me completely floored. By the end of the film, I felt emotionally drained of all my feelings and thoughts due to the increasingly heavier, devastating narrative co-written by Zeller and Christopher Hampton, adapted from the former's award-winning play, Le P\u00e8re. This could have been yet another generic story about dementia, but Zeller's brilliant storytelling places the viewer in the protagonist's skin, offering a terrifying viewpoint of the disease. From the very first minute until the end, the spectators accompany Anthony, an old man starting to lose track of reality, through his own perspective.I genuinely don't know if this sort of point of view has been depicted before, particularly in the case of dementia, but either way, it's a harrowing experience that will surely leave a vast majority of its viewers extremely captivated throughout the entire runtime. Watching Anthony go through scenes that he wholly believes are indeed happening as he sees them is as attention-grabbing as it is frustrating and sad once the audience gets to see how the same scenes really played out. In fact, if one starts watching the movie without even knowing the synopsis, the first act will almost seem like a mystery-thriller due to so many twists and turns regarding previous conversations that Anthony and the viewers believe are 100% real.Zeller and Hampton's script doesn't only approach Anthony's feelings but also the loved ones surrounding him, which I firmly believe was both necessary and honest. The Father doesn't shy away from showing the boiled-up frustration and even desperation that the family usually goes through when dealing with someone with this terrible health condition. I have no words to describe how thoughtful and impactful Zeller's storytelling method ends up being. I found myself remarkably surprised once I realized the film had reached the one-hour mark. The control of the movie's pacing and tone is absolutely seamless. Technically, Yorgos Lamprinos' editing work is as impeccable as Ben Smithard's lingering cinematography.However, it's Ludovico Einaudi's outstanding score that steals the spotlight in the technical realm. From the atmospheric, grand opera music to the more subtle tracks, Einaudi makes sure to elevate the critical moments with a noticeable sound that helps the viewer understand the progressive shift in Anthony's perception of reality. Zeller demonstrates immense talent in his feature film directorial debut. Being an adaptation from his own play certainly aids him in bringing the story from stage-to-screen, but his filmmaking choices are worthy of recognition, such as the extensive use of long takes to let the actors shine in their layered roles. And since I mentioned the cast...Anthony Hopkins delivers an award-worthy performance that only finds in Chadwick Boseman (Ma Rainey's Black Bottom) a serious rival for this year's awards season. Hopkins holds countless astonishing displays throughout his career, but this one is definitely one of my favorites. I never anticipated I'd shed so many tears by watching an old man cry or getting slapped in the face, though it's not even due to the acts themselves but to everything that builds up those moments. During most of the runtime, I don't really feel sadness or anger. Instead, I feel every character's pain because it's incredibly hard to watch how everyone deals with the situation. Hopkins and Olivia Colman are undoubtedly the most impactful, but Olivia Williams and Imogen Poots also add a lot to the sentimental component.I insinuate above that The Father impacted me at a personal level. A little bit about my life: my grandfather didn't have dementia, but his mind slowly deteriorated until it reached a point where he had to spend his last few months on this planet stuck in a bed without really talking or moving. Still to this day, part of me regrets not spending that much time with him near the end, while the other part feels a bit relieved that my memory of him in his \"normal\" state remains intact. I always feared that if I visited him often in his last days of living, I'd only remember his time at the nursing home instead of the years packed with tremendously essential lessons he taught me. This movie left me sleepless, spending the night thinking about that time of my life...The Father is an overwhelmingly devastating depiction of the painfully progressive disease that is dementia. Florian Zeller's extremely captivating storytelling places the viewers inside the protagonist's mind, making the audience witness and feel everything through his unclear perspective. Zeller and Christopher Hampton deliver a brilliantly unique screenplay packed with emotional punches that will leave no one indifferent. From the perfect editing to the persistent camera work, it's Ludovico Einaudi's gorgeous, impactful score that elevates the big moments. Zeller's use of long takes feels both necessary and important to attach the viewers' attention to Anthony Hopkins, who delivers an award-worthy, powerfully compelling performance. One of my favorites of his entire career. Hopefully, this will be the closest I'll ever be to experience this mental condition. My personal connection to this film justifies why I'll offer it my highest rating since November 2019 (Ford v Ferrari). One of the best movies I've seen in the last couple of years. Do not miss it!Rating: A+",

He goes from charming and funny to menacing to wholly lost in seconds. From man to child on a dime. It's a powerful rumination on a terrifying disease, bolstered by Sir Tony at his finest, a strong supporting turn from Olivia Colman, and an excellent script by Christopher Hampton and Florian Zeller (based on Zeller's play). It's a daring move to tell the story from the perspective of Hopkins' character as his mind increasingly deteriorates. A savvy one too, as the audience is forced to engage to truly understand what is real, who is who, and where precisely we are in our protagonist's gut-wrenching journey. This may be Hopkins best work, a late-career revelation that once again reminds us why he's one of our finest cinematic performers. Be warned. If you've ever been touched by the tragedy of dementia, this film could wreck you.",

I get a buzz off seeing an actor harness everything in their being to master the craft (DDL in There Will Be Blood; PSH in Capote, The Master). Hopkins is 83; he delivers an absolutely abnormally outrageous performance. One in which, if you're watching it right, will linger long after. It's mesmerising.But to oversell on the acting alone is to do Zeller a disservice. Coleman is also great. The film and its script (adapted from the stage) is just beautiful. It sucks you in, allowing you to fully realise the disease in all its terrible, and dare I say it, funny, contradictions. I wouldn't want to spoil this for anyone.

This film is based on a stage play, and centers around a woman in a relationship who visits her aging father, who is beginning to show signs of dementia, in London due to concerns that he can no longer take care of herself. Narratively, it's not always as memorable as one would hope, but the strong performances and careful direction carry the film home at the end of the day and overall craft something certainly worth watching.Anthony Hopkins is undoubtedly terrific here. He is able to convey both frailty yet genuine shock and empathy, while trying to better understand those around him that even he regularly connects with. Colman's performance is compassionate yet multi-layered, conveying clear emotional depth. The film's aesthetic is simple, modest and unpretentious, yet it manages to skillfully and quietly play a role within the film as a whole by adding to an atmosphere of confusion about what is real and what is not real due to Hopkins' character's dementia. The screenplay is generally well-written, but the dialogue is not quite as sharp or powerful as one would hope. Despite a fleeting running time, the film is leisurely paced, which is fine because it allows viewers the ability to take in the details of the characters' interpersonal relations. Yet while very moving in parts, the story doesn't quite build up to a true emotional crescendo that one would expect from a powerful, character-driven drama. That said, the acting combined with a thoughtful tone of generally subdued reverence makes the film very worthwhile viewing. 7.5/10",

Some scenes repeats themselves with completely another character replaced, some elements form the set are altered or entirely disappeared, even the house Anthony is living in may change completely and through these modifications we get to experience the dementia that is affecting Anthony (or many real life people for that matter) and his sense of perception.This film makes brilliant use of every part and aspect to tell its story in the most compelling and intriguing way possible.

            "content": "Anthony Hopkins is one of the most noted thespians of all time. From his work on the stage, to his iconic Hannibal Lector portrayal, and even a more recent turn on the TV series Westworld, Hopkins is about as upper-echelon as actors get. Somewhat remarkably, then, his leading role in \"The Father\" might just be one of his top roles of them all.For a very basic overview, \"The Father\" tells the story of Anthony (Hopkins), an aging man who seems \"a little off\" (perhaps some senile dementia). While visited by daughter Anne (Olivia Coleman), things start to get even stranger for Anthony. People leave the room and come back as others, or show up in his England flat seemingly at random (Mark Gatiss, Olivia Williams, & Rufus Sewell). The new live-in caregiver (Imogen Poots)? She bears a striking resemblance to his other daughter. As the odd events continue to pile up, Anthony struggles to figure out just what exactly is \"real\" and what may be a result of his dementia.I can't say any more about the plot of \"The Father\" without ruining some of its endgame drama, but suffice it to say that it is an utterly riveting treatise on the betrayal of one's own mind. Just the way certain scenes are shot/framed keeps the viewer off-balance (like Anthony), and the \"answers\" you are looking for are all provided along the way (even if it may not feel like it in the moment at film's end). It neither lags, nor feels rushed in any way.The big draw here, though, is Hopkins' performance for the ages. If you make it through \"The Father\" without being severely emotionally moved, you'll be in the vast minority. In moments both depressing and funny/uplifting, Hopkins proves just how versatile of a performer he is. He can draw the audience in with his gregarious (and mysterious) nature, and absolutely break that same crowd's hearts with his raw emotion. A very obvious candidate (if not outright winner) for the Best Actor Oscar.Overall, \"The Father\" is on my short-list of top-five films released during the odd 2020 pandemic film season. Hopkins (and the supporting cast) provides extraordinary acting talent, the plot is intriguing from beginning to end, and it tells a story that can be viewed with equal parts sorrow and hope. It's an emotional rollercoaster that will completely enrapture your mind and heart.",

He's acted brilliantly for so long and I don't mean to undermine anything he's ever accomplished in the past, but normally by now actors start phoning it in. But wow. He was not.This film was devastating to watch. In the best way possible. From the acting - which was lead by Hopkins but was not just great because of him! - to the writing, directing, scoring, editing, cinematography on and on and on everything was amazing! The only reason I did not give it a perfect 10/10 is because I so rarely give them out I'm afraid to act too rashly and give it out too soon but trust me... I may end up doing just that.As someone who has experienced the subject matter of this film personally in my family I cannot express how painfully accurate every little detail was in the writing and in Hopkins' beautiful performance. The confusion, the anger, the regret, the brutal honesty and lack of self awareness, the fear, the bipolar nature was all so frighteningly accurate that I forgot many times that I was watching a film not a documentary or even real life.I don't say this lightly.. this may not only be the best film of the past year but of the past decade.

Basically, Anne (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Olivia Colman) visits her father Anthony (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Anthony Hopkins) in his flat after he becomes aggressive towards his recent caretaker. Anthony has developing dementia and constantly forgets important life events and where things are in his flat, including his watch, even though he places it in the same place every day. He tells Anne he thinks his recent caretaker stole his watch and that he will never leave his flat. Anne tells Anthony she plans to leave London and move to Paris to live with her new boyfriend. Anthony is confused and thinks she is still married to James, but she tells him that they have been divorced for five years and leaves. The next day, Anthony sees a man he does not recognise named Paul (Mark Gatiss) and is confused that he is living with him in his flat. Paul states that Anthony lives with him and Anne. Anthony is confused when Anne returns from the shops with chicken for dinner and appears as a different woman (Olivia Williams). His confusion causes him to become frustrated. Anne schedules an interview for a new caretaker in his house. Laura (Imogen Poots) meets with Anthony for the position. During their meeting Anthony claims he was a professional dancer and that he doesn't need any living assistance. After Laura has been hired, Anthony states that she reminds him of his other daughter Lucy. He mentions that he has not talked to Lucy for months for reasons he is unaware of. Anthony is taken to Dr. Sarai (Coronation Street's Ayesha Dharker) by Anne and is asked about his memory; he claims he has no memory problems. Anthony tells Laura about how proud he is of his daughter Lucy, who is a painter. Laura tells him she is very sorry about Lucy's accident, but Anthony is unaware of what she is referring to. Laura drops the subject and moves on to give him his medication. Over the course of the film, it is revealed that Anthony has really been living with Anne and Paul for years, Paul has also changed in appearance (Rufus Sewell). But Anthony believes he is still living in his private flat. The night Anne comes back with the chicken from the market, she and Paul have an argument over a vacation to Italy they had to cancel to look after Anthony due to his difficult behaviour with the caretaker, and about how much Anne sacrifices for her father. Paul asks Anthony how long he plans to stay in their flat and annoy everyone, and he slaps Anthony to the point of crying. Then a few moments later, Paul's appearance changes again (Mark Gatiss), and the argument and slapping repeat. Anthony wakes up in his room and walks out of the flat, only to find himself in a hospital hallway. He remembers his daughter Lucy (Imogen Poots) died in a car accident at the hospital. He sees her bloody body in the hospital room. At that moment, he wakes up in a completely different bedroom, now in a nursing home. His nurse, Catherine (Olivia Williams), checks in on him and informs him Anne has moved to Paris with Paul and visits on occasional weekends. Another nurse, Bill (Mark Gatiss), also visits during their interaction. Anthony has an emotional breakdown over his inability to understand what is going on anymore and Anne's disappearance. He becomes child-like and cries wanting his mother. Catherine comforts him as he sobs and tells him she'll take him outside for a walk in the park. Hopkins gives an astonishing performance as the elderly man suffering the devastating illness and constant paranoia and confusion, Colman is terrific as his concerned daughter saddened by his deteriorating mind, and the support of Poots, Sewell, Williams and Gatiss is perfect. What makes this film stand out, besides the extraordinary Hopkins and the fantastic script, is the clever editing and structure of storytelling, with distorted realities and dramatic shifts in perspective, the visual trickery and twists are a literal representation of what having dementia must be like, it is a breath-taking and emotionally engaging drama. It won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Editing, Best Production Design, and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film, Outstanding British Film of the Year, Best Production Design, and Best Editing, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and Best Screenplay.

His mental state is troubling to him, her and the help and as his mental state deteriorates tough decisions plague the family.

There isn't one aspect of this movie that isn't perfect. The acting by everyone in the cast is all time great and perfect. The depiction of what people with Alzheimer's go through and how it impacts their life's choices is perfectly presented. It also depicts how family's need to make tough decisions, often to their own detriment, and how they can be torn between their own happiness and the happiness of their family members. There is so much I learned and appreciated about this movie, especially since my grandfather recently passed away with Alzheimer's. I strongly, strongly, strongly recommend seeing this masterpiece and would easily score this a 10/10.",

            "content": "THE FATHER is one of the most powerful films in recent memory, with two knockout performances from Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman. Hopkins plays an old man who is plagued by dementia, and who is refusing care from his daughter, played by Colman, because he believes that he can take care of himself adequately on his own. The movie is structured from the perspective of Hopkins -- the audience often sees things in a non-linear fashion and is not introduced to certain major characters, making them just as strange to us as they are to Hopkins in his mind.The writing from Florian Zeller is impeccable, managing to be creative while also giving us a devastating look into how it feels to suffer from dementia. While it sometimes feels just as much like a play as a movie, it never bores the audience with any superfluous details and implores the audience to attempt to find their way through a maze that has no ending. The editing and direction makes us feel as though we are being deceived, making us empathize with Hopkins while also siding with his caretaker, who is doing everything she can to care for her sick father.The performances are the best of 2020, with Hopkins being possibly the best he has been on-screen in decades. (If Chadwick Boseman weren't such a strong contender for lead actor, I'd say give the Oscar to Hopkins.) Colman, however, may be my pick for best supporting actress, because she portrays the pain of watching a loved one slip into confusion and paranoia with heartbreaking reality.The final ten minutes of the movie are my favorite scenes acting-wise of the past year. THE FATHER is an essential watch that everyone should seek out.A",

            "content": "\"The Father\" (2020 release from the UK; 97 min.) brings the story of Anthony, an 83 yr. man with dementia. As the movie opens, his daughter Anne visits him. Anthony's caretaker has quit, after he accused her of stealing his watch. Then, to Anne's exasperation, he finds the watch. Anne herself has big news: she informs him that she is moving to Paris, to live with her new boyfriend Paul. But how will that impact Anthony, who even with the helop of a caretaker, is so dependent on Anne? At this point we are less than 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the debut film of French writer/director Florian Zeller. And what a debut it is. The script is based on Zeller's award-winning stage play of the same name. The movie is remarkable on several levels. First and foremost, the entire fim is brought from Anthony's perspective. This means that timelines are warped and things do not always appear to be what they are. This is what happens to one's mind when you are dealing with dementia. I've seen a number of films on this topic, and I feel that this is the first time that a filmmaker \"gets it\". Compare this for example to the 2014 film \"Still Alice\" starring Julianna Moore, which brings an utterly laughable Hollywood version of Alzheimer's. Anyone who has first-hand witnessed the devastation of what dementia in its various forms (including Alzheimer's) will do to a person's mind will immediately know what I mean. I saw it with my dad (RIP), a brilliant man who descended into the hell that is full-blown Alzheimer's. The second thing that makes \"The Father\" so remarkable is of course Anthony Hopkins. He plays a fictionalized version of himself, to devastating effect. At some point in the film he is asked by a doctor what his date of birth is, and the Anthony character immediately responds \"31 December 1937\", which is of course the actual birthday of Anthony Hopkins. This performance, on the heels of his equally impressive showing in \"The Two Popes\", demonstrates once again (as if more proof is needed) that Anthony Hopkins is one of the all time great actors, period. Olivia Colman as Anne does very well too, but honestly she is blown out of the water by the towering performance from Anthony Hopkins. Bottom line: \"The Father\" is one of the finest movies of the year. It has already collected a bunch of awards and nominations (including at the Golden Globes and at the BAFTAs--the British Oscars), and no doubt will be in line for a bunch of Oscar nominations AND wins.\"The Father\" premiered to immediate critical acclaim at last year's Sundance film festival, yes, well over a year ago already. It was supposed to get a major theatrical release sometime last Fall, but a little thing called COVID-19 had other plans. It finally is now receiving a limited theater release before moving onto streaming services. The film opened this weekend and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at was attended okay: 9 people including myself to be exact, which is on the high side for movie screenings these days (most screenings that I've attended typically get 5 to 10 people). The rest of the movieplex resembled a ghost town. I honestly don't know how movie theaters can operate profitably like that. Meanwhile, if you really want to get a sense what dementia is like, or if you simply are a fan of Anthony Hopkins, I'd readily suggest you run, don't walk, and check this out, be it in a theater (while you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",

Hopkins however didn't do anything I haven't watched from him before it's just used differently here due to the characters mental decline. It's a Hopkins standard blustery and harsh then vulnerable and needy . Watch Howard's End or Remains of the Day it's similar in it's way. .To see a different element of his talent we have Hannibal Lecter so he definitely has range as an actor.

The cinematography is fantastic, how the transitions are made up into one big loop of events that round up to make sense but in the end nothing really makes sense when you're losing your memory to a weary old mind.I guess it will take multiple watches for me to look out for all of the details I missed to make a picture to at least seem whole but as of now The Father is a perfect representation of what's really happening inside the head of an old sick man and Sir Anthony played his part gracefully and was very touching. So did Olivia Colman and all the rest of the cast.Overall I feel like there's so much left for me to discover in this movie and this is literally the best thing about the art of cinema: that it puts a seed of wisdom or a thought into your brain and let it blossom naturally, and, when the movie is as great as this one is, with every new rewatch it will give your tree of thoughts more and more branches, colors and beauty.",

Mental health is different because you might feel that you are in tip-top shape while in reality, those around you have been trying to cope with your symptoms for a long time. The Father is a story of an old man who is stubborn about moving to an elderly home and instead chooses to live in his daughter's flat. Or does the daughter live in his flat?He isn't quite sure where he actually lives as each day the surroundings seem to change without his consent. Despite that, he is going about his business as if everything is normal while in reality it's far from that and his daughter is the one who is heartbroken because her father is not in his right mind.It's obvious that the events are tragic but because of how Anthony acts and the way in which the film presents his \"adventures\", it feels ok to laugh. As a matter of fact, Hopkins wants you to laugh up until a certain point where both his acting and the film's mood signify that things have become quite serious. \"Where has all my life gone?\" - he says and at that instant, you can't help but feel a certain pain in your heart. What's more, your head will begin to spin in an attempt to connect the small pieces to the big picture.We all know that Sir Anthony Hopkins is a Titan of acting but he seemingly disappeared during the last decade. Turns out he has been saving up his acting for the right role and this outstanding performance puts him right next to Riz Ahmed in the lead to win the Oscar.

            "content": "Brilliant, bold, and so well written- The Father is hardly just another play turned into a film, it's a unique, incredibly acted, and thought-provoking masterpiece. I've never been a huge fan of Anthony Hopkins, I certainly respect him as an actor, and feel he is very talented, but for me he just didn't stand out in comparison to so many others. His role in this film not only changed my mind, as well as prove to be my favorite of his roles, but is done so incredibly well and so personal and emotional anyone with common sense will be blown away. It's such a well executed story, so raw and personal, without ever striving away from confusion, and feeling so complete in the process. It's truly a miracle of filmmaking, and besides a slightly slow start, I have absolutely nothing to complain about it. Olivia Colman holds her own in her supporting role as the aging Hopkin's daughter, and again you will be moved to tears by her performance. We have an excellent supporting cast to follow, but no one quite sticks out as much as those too, although Imogen Poots, despite her short runtime, does prove to be rather memorable. The score is brilliant, and so is the cinematography. Every aspect of this film seems developed to its full potential, and i've never left a film feeling so emotionally impacted, emotionally drained, and satisfied all at once. In the end, The Father is an experience i'll never forget, and certainly one of the best movies of the year.\nMy Rating: 10/10",

            "content": "Great performances, production, and editing create this powerful and sad story about an aging man with dementia who can no longer distinguish between past and future, often unable to differentiate between dreams and reality. He sees parts of his memories throughout his life, tries to grab on to something he perceives as his reality. Having lost almost all his memories, and left with the only deepest of them, the memory of his mother, aware of his own confusion, he has no choice but to hide from it all and seek protection from the person closest to him.The film hits much harder if you can relate, it's just this state of hopelessness when you know you cannot do much to help your loved ones.I definitely recommend this movie for viewing, and I hope this story will be something you will never have to experience in your life.",

            "review_title": "Beautifully made and moving film depicting dementia in its raw, brutal essence",
            "content": "A beautifully-made and moving film, The Father depicts dementia in its raw, brutal essence and will surely make an imprint on your soul.The French-British film centers around aging Anthony (Anthony Hopkins), an Englishman who \"has his ways,\" as his daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) says. As Anthony develops dementia and his condition worsens, Anne finds it difficult to balance her life with caring for her father. The film traces how the two of them go about their lives together and how the disease progresses. The Father is told in a jumbled manner because our perspective of the film is as Anthony would see it: All out of order. Anne's husband Paul (Rufus Sewell) and another man who claims to be her husband, a woman, and several caretakers all appear and disappear throughout the film. Even the settings shift, and you're never really sure where you are. Director Florian Zeller and his crew design both Anne and Anthony's apartments to look relatively similar which enhances that perspective of disorientation.Anthony Hopkins has always played cerebral roles, so this more emotional one is unique in his repertoire. He sheds tears, flies into fits of rage, and immerses himself in the character of a strong-willed man slowly losing his grip on what's happening. The last scene is especially poignant and hard-hitting; no spoilers, though! Olivia Colman's portrayal of Anne is one that many who have dealt with a relative suffering from a progressive mental illness will identify with. It's incredibly realistic, and, at times, you forget that she's an actress playing a character. Anne herself is layered, especially in how she copes with Anthony's dementia, first keeping her emotions bundled up, escalating to emotional breakdowns, and eventually to some scary fantasies. Colman deals with these feelings beautifully, immersing herself much like Hopkins does. Director Florian Zeller isn't actually a director by profession; he's a playwright, and this film was adapted from his play Le P\u00e9re. He's a master storyteller, and you couldn't tell this is his first gig as a director. His attention to detail (especially with sets, something I'm sure he took from his career in playwriting), combined with his personal experiences (his grandmother was diagnosed with dementia when Zeller was 12) make this film an earnest yet unsettling project.The Father cries out to its viewers to enjoy life while they have their senses and to show compassion toward those who have begun to lose (or have already lost) a clear view of the world. It's a sobering portrait of mental illness and yet an empowering film for those coping with their individual struggles. There is some profanity, slight violence (Paul slaps Anthony), and Anthony and Anne's father-daughter relationship gets a bit abusive at times.I give The Father 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, plus adults; younger kids could watch the film if they feel comfortable with themes like mental illness. The Father releases on-demand on March 12, 2021.Reviewed by Eshaan M., KIDS FIRST!",

            "content": "If there's one flaw with 'The Father (2020)', it's that Hopkins' character seems to be able to perceive events he has yet to experience. The film uses nonlinearity, alongside a few other formalistic techniques that I won't spoil here, to convey how its protagonist's deteriorating mental state leaves him confused and feeling as though his world is changing around him. That's all fine and it usually works as intended, putting you in the increasingly disoriented headspace of the lead. Sometimes, though, the protagonist will reference, in specific detail, events that have actually happened in the film but not in its established chronology. Basically, he mentions things we've seen but he hasn't, things that are yet to occur to him. Of course, he could just be getting confused; that is a large part of the narrative, after all, and we're supposed to question the validity of some depicted events. However, the specificity of his assertions doesn't make him seem confused so much as precognitive. There is an argument to be made that the whole picture is a series of lucid memories that he's making his way through, the entire thing essentially taking place in his head at the very end of the plot, but that doesn't quite ring true because there are several scenes told from the perspective of his daughter which depict events he could never possibly have witnessed. Regardless of this, though, the movie still works well and achieves what it sets out to. Our lead is a man out of time due to his illness, and his condition comes across rather keenly. Even if the movie feels as though it's tripping over itself ever so slightly, it's ultimately successful at putting us in the increasingly frustrated and uncomfortable headspace of the protagonist. His world doesn't make sense, so perhaps that's why the film itself doesn't quite add up. I say 'quite' because other than the occasional bit of precognition, the narrative itself is relatively easy to keep up with. Its presented a bit like a puzzle, leaving you to figure out where each scene takes place within the flick's chronology and where the seams are between time jumps. It's an engaging effort and presents a distinct approach to its under-represented subject matter. The picture isn't quite as emotionally impactful as it perhaps could have been, for me at least, and there is the occasional sense that some further work could've been done to smooth the story's transition from stage to screen (there are a lot of monologues). In the end, though, this is a compelling and effective look into an ageing mind that properly conveys the horror of perhaps the most despicable disease known to man. 7/10.",

            "review_title": "A heartbreakingly convincing portrayal of dementia",
            "content": "The Father is the 2020 directorial debut of French playwright Florian Zeller, with he co-wrote with Christopher Hampton based on his play Le P\u00e8re. It received considerable praise on its release, not least for the central performance of Anthony Hopkins as the eponymous protagonist, which won him several awards including an Oscar for Best Actor. It was well deserved, but there's considerably more to the film than just Hopkins' acting.The Father is a heartbreakingly convincing portrayal of dementia, and the film's masterstroke lies in telling the story from the central character Anthony's point of view. Zeller achieves a remarkable insight into the mind of somebody with dementia, capturing the frustration, confusion, loneliness and fear of a man who is, literally, losing his mind. It's a superb piece of writing, with a narrative as fractured as the faculties of its protagonist who struggles to make sense of his life; dramatic coherence demands that the audience is allowed to do so, but only by assembling Anthony's snapshot, jumbled memories into a picture that he can no longer fully appreciate. The film is remarkable in capturing the unpleasant effects of dementia, remembering that it doesn't just cause benign memory loss, but can result in spite, anger, aggression, and deep emotional hurt to the victim's loved ones. As Anthony's condition worsens, so too does the confusion in the script: the audience is left uncertain as to whether Paul slapping Anthony really happens, or if he imagines it; only at the end do we learn that Anne really has moved to Paris, despite contradictory claims earlier in the film.Zeller and Hampton tease out the details of Anthony's past and present through his interaction with family members and carers, but obfuscate them by capturing Anthony's confused point of view in the shifting sets, cast changes and non-linear narrative. To convey Anthony's confusion, his daughter Anne is played by two different actresses, as is her husband Paul. Our understanding of those around Anthony changes from scene to scene and from actor to actor, proving as disorientating for the audience as it is for Anthony. This is reflected in the cinematography of Ben Smithard, whose camerawork manages to make the familiar seem suddenly cold and alien at times, and who uses point of view shots to make things less clear, not more. Ludovico Einaudi's subtle score helps, adding discordance at moments of confusion to create an unsettling air that reflects Anthony's state of mind.And the acting does ultimately contribute a great deal. Hopkins' naturalistically portrays Anthony's gradual deterioration over the course of the film, culminating in the much-praised scene of him crying for his mummy, and it is possibly a career best performance from a man with a very impressive career indeed. He's joined by Olivia Colman, who is very convincing as a loving daughter driven to her wit's end by her father's condition and his occasionally hurtful outbursts. She even imagines smothering him with a pillow at one point, whilst Anthony's needs also put strain on her marriage. These are painfully realistic depictions of what dementia can be like, in contrast to its occasional depiction in the arts and media as a sort of benign memory loss.The Father is hard to watch at times, but it is both worthwhile and rewarding, and as skilfully directed as it is written. It deserved all the plaudits lavished upon it, and it is to be hoped that Zeller's next feature film is just as impressive.",

            "content": "The last 20 years have not been an overly memorable time for the screen icon that is Sir Anthony Hopkins.If you take away his impressive turns in the well-received 2019 drama The Two Popes and the hugely enjoyable New Zealand biopic from 2005 The World's Fastest Indian, Hopkins last two decades have seen the esteemed performer lower his colors in a range of forgettable features that have failed to utilize the skill and strengths of an aged yet still considerable talent.Thankfully the multi-Oscar nominated and critically lauded The Father, directed by debut feature director Florian Zeller (adapting his own stage play of the same name) gives Hopkins a chance to deliver what could just be his best ever performance; a huge call I know when you weigh up his Oscar winning turn in The Silence of the Lambs, but his devastatingly beautiful and unforgettable turn here as the dementia stricken Anthony is a once in a blue moon type occurrence.One of the most honest and raw examinations of growing old and losing ones sense of identity and purpose, The Father features Hopkins in almost every single scene of its mostly apartment based setting as Anthony's loose tracking of time, events and even his loved ones leads to a surprisingly intricate narrative that may feel familiar in parts but utterly unique in the way in which Zeller explores Anthony's tale and tells the story from his fractured point of view.Ably supported by the always great Olivia Coleman (quickly becoming one of the most effective performers in Hollywood) and some small turns from the likes of Olivia Williams, Imogen Poots and Rufus Sewell, there's no mistake that The Father is Hopkins film and lives and dies off his performance but at the age of 83 the screen legend proves that he still has what it takes to handle drama, comedy and the human element that makes his turn so noteworthy here.There are moments when Hopkins turns the dial almost instantaneously between cool, calm and collected and either aggressively assertive or forlorn and lost and there's barely a chance that you walk away from this experience without being moved by his incredibly well-rounded turn here, delivering a performance for the ages that will touch many of us personally who have seen someone just like Anthony in our lives, lost within themselves as their mind no longer allows them to be who they once were.Final Say -A stagey but nevertheless captivating drama that explores the often unspoken about truths of growing old and coming to terms with ones mortality/frailty, The Father is top-class stuff and a stunning reminder of the skill Hopkins still possesses as a big screen performer.4 1/2 watches out of 5Share The Goodies -",

The film reminded me of the famous Gerard Manley Hopkins poem Spring and Fall, in which the poet begins by asking a young child, \"Margaret are you grieving, Over Goldengrove unleaving?\" He goes on to say: \"Now no matter, child, the name; Sorrow's springs are the same,\" and concludes with the lines, \"It is the blight man was born for, It is Margaret you mourn for.\" By the end of The Father, I was a blubbering mess, mourning as much for Anthony as for myself.Read the full review on Film Companion.",

Little changes to major changes can be seen throughout the movie, from tiles to cabinet pattern to the clothing and even plastic bag, it was really neat. Different color palettes and different layouts were use to tell whose character perspective are we looking at.Hopkins performance was off the roof, he was charismatic and playful but sometimes cruel. Definitely one of his best performance. To sum it up this movie was horrifying, compelling and confusing, I had a great time.",

In particular the progression from forgetting where one's watch is once a day, then two, three etc, then every five minute. Then ultimately forgetting how to chew and eat, then breathing resulting in death and a funeral where everyone stands around saying \"They're in a better place now\".Furthermore I have utmost respect for Anthony Hopkins but he fails me here, IMHO he probably didn't spend enough time with suffers of dementia, in researching his character.Resulting in the typical Hopkins stereotype poking through many times throughout the movie.

I think the plot is fairly simple and nothing is being given away with the synopsis of how it describes the characters demise into dementia.As an explanation of the condition its great, but as a film it doesn't really work. It does a very good job of describing the descent of the main character, and gives a fairly vivid description of his confusion, despair and random behaviour, but this becomes quite tiresome and repetitive as the film progresses.There just isn't enough of a story here, nothing of significance happens, and even when changes occur to the character or his circumstances, they happen within the disconnected framework of his condition which is a very low key, subtle affair.There are no developments that take place to draw you into the story, the characters plight, or that of his family. The screenplay in general is very one dimensional and offers no real emotional investment in the film, other than pity of his condition to progress past this fairly slight and unrewarding concept.Don't get me wrong, I'm sure many people can identify with the film and even realise with so much more understanding how dementia affects people (especially loved ones) because of this film. It highlights the effects of the condition exceptionally well. I'm also sure older people watching this will probably have an unpleasant experience on what's possibly awaiting them in the short to medium term, but as a movie it still doesn't work, it isn't enough. It is more of a documentary, as a movie it simply doesn't deliver.I'm struggling to give it a fair score for movie value whilst recognising the intent of the film makers may not have been specifically entertain per se, and I'm finding it quite difficult. What the film does, it does very well, but outside that it has little to offer, and I think as a result 5/10 is a fair score.",

The way its plot is structured & narrated provides added clarity to what it's like to live with dementia as the mind deteriorates piece by piece and one loses grasp of their time, reality, thoughts & memories but still try to make a rational sense of it.The homely setting, silent camerawork, undisturbed pace & fine editing do fit the premise but the real highlight are the performances. Anthony Hopkins delivers an absolute powerhouse of an act here, articulating his character's pride, fear, agony & perplexity with precision, and it's one of his career-best works. Olivia Colman is in as his daughter who painfully watches her father wither away and chips in with an emotionally hefty input.Overall, The Father is nuanced in its storytelling, empathetic in its presentation, and features Hopkins & Colman in splendid form. The bewilderment it causes is deliberate to make the viewers scramble for answers & rational explanation just like our protagonist and the more they relate to him, the more devastating it all gets. A promising start to Florian Zeller's filmmaking career, The Father is tragic, harrowing & powerfully moving. Don't miss it.",

People forget just how revered Hopkins is in the acting profession. Other actors would bend over backwards just to share a scene with him.This is a man who was anointed as Laurence Olivier's successor many decades ago.In The Father, Hopkins gives a masterclass in acting. Anthony is a man living with dementia and his world is jumbled up.People, places, relationships have no fixed bearings.Based on Florian Zeller's own stage play. Zeller as director makes small subtle changes to unsettle the audience so they can sympathise with Anthony's confusion, frustration and even anger.Several actors play different characters with slightly askew performances which makes the audience doubt them.It is all part of the film's structure. In the centre of it all is Hopkins and I doubt the film would work without him, especially at the end when he talks about his mother.The film's innovative narrative has been slightly robbed by other genres. The British soap opera Emmerdale had a special point of view episode in 2016 where the former vicar's early onset of dementia demonstrates his confused state of mind.The Father ploughs a similar field.

In some ways, The Father is the scariest horror film that I have ever seen. You need to be emotionally prepared to watch this film and the Alzheimer's disease reality that it presents. This is not a \"date night\" movie. Schindler's List has more lighthearted moments in it than The Father.Do not let these comments discourage you from watching The Father, though. If you are a fan of cinema and the wide breadth of emotions that it can elicit, The Father is simply a jaw-dropping exposition into the very raw emotions that this disease can, and has, inflicted on countless generations of families, including my own. You will probably not want to re-watch The Father as soon as it is finished, and that is okay. It reminds me of Requiem for a Dream (2000) in that both films are very emotionally powerful, but I was not dying to see either of them again right after I saw them the first time. Some films are better left to marinate on our consciousness, and The Father is certainly one of those.",

Even the writer / director Florian Zeller didn't think otherwise, offering the script since 2017 to the great actor and refusing to make the film without him (the character's name is Athony because it can only be his) Ffff inspired choice because Hopkins is masterful! Merit that was recognized this year with an Oscar (the actor has another for Silence of the Lambs - 1991) being the oldest actor who received this distinction at 84, dethroning him (if you can say that even though everyone has well-established place in the panoply of great actors as well as in our hearts) Christopher Plummer who was awarded at the age of 82.Olivia Colman (as Anne's daughter) is slightly overshadowed by Hopkins' overwhelming personality (who wouldn't she be ?!) yet she plays a wonderful role.The film also has parts in which music plays an important role, Hopkins being a great lover of classical music and even singing the piano. The area from Bizet's \"Pearl Fishermen\" was chosen for the film at his suggestion, being one of his favorites.I don't think there is much more to say about this film (it \"took my maul\" anyway as they say) and I don't even know if it would be good to recommend it to people who have old or sick parents or to young people who don't he would (still) understand its depth.\"The Father\" is such a realistic movie that it's good to put on a list and watch only when you have the necessary mood but ... by no means ignored!",

            "content": "One of the most popular earlier movies about dementia is \"The notebook\" (2004), a weepy romance that put Ryan Gosling on the map. \"The father\" (2020) takes the dramatization of this tragic occurrence up a few notched, well above melodrama.\"The father\" is adapted from a modern (2011) French play. I browsed several critics' reviews on performances of \"Le Pere\" in the last few years (in London, Washington, Sydney and New York). As a result, I was able to appreciate the narrative's unique style more than otherwise, but at the cost of sacrificing an unimpaired first impression.\"The father\" reminds me of \"Le vie en rose\" (2007), in which Marion Cotillard won her Oscar for the portrayal of legendary French singer Edith Piaf. In both these movies, gradual deterioration in mental capacity is conveyed with montages seen through the protagonist's POV.The English movie \"The father\" stays close to the original play, but with the roles of the two cities, Paris and London, reversed, for obvious reasons. The familiar story is told through 6 characters, 4 real and 2 surreal (identified as \"the man\" and \"the woman\"). Familiarity notwithstanding, the story is not less tragic, particularly when depicted by the heart-wrenching performance of the two leads.The following simple linear recounting of events is nowhere near the way it is presented in the movie. Successful retired engineer Anthony (Anthony Hopkins) lost his younger daughter Lucy years ago (details fuzzy) and has been relying on divorced daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) as his emotions crutch. As his dementia gets worse, Anne moved him out of his upscale apartment to live with her and her boyfriend Paul (Rufus Sewell), while employing a part-time caregiver to take care of Anthony during daytime.The starting point of the movie is when Anne decides to move with Paul to Paris. Anthony's \"having his way\" has driven away several caregivers and she is hopeful that the latest candidate, young and attractive Laura (Imogen Poots) will work out for him. The sad, ultimate inevitability comes when just prior to moving to Paris, Anne has to yield to Paul's realistic reasoning for putting Anthony into a nursing home. The aforementioned 4 are the \"real\" characters.The remaining two are mainly Anthony's hallucinations. \"The man\" (Mark Gatiss) represents the dark side of the men he had come across in his life - Paul in the present, his ex-son-in-law in the past, and other male characters real and imagined. \"The woman\" (Olivia Williams) plays the alternative versions (neutral, not \"the dark side\") of Anne and Laura to enhance the effect of the confusion in Anthony's mind. In the final scene, Williams also plays the real-life nurse Catherine caring for Anthony in the nursing home.As mentioned, what the audience witness on the screen (and stage, in the play) is nowhere near to being simple, and the narrative is anything but linear. We are never sure where is where, when is when, who is who. And that is exactly the effect desired, seeing things through Anthony's confused mind, the erosion of which has been renders excruciatingly detailed.Anthony starts out just a little bit confused about his supposedly missing watch, but comes out emphatically when Anne intimates that she is moving to Paris. \"Like rats leaving a ship\", he promptly asserts \"You're abandoning me\". In a later scene, he accuses Anne for waiting for his death so that she can have his flat. \"I am going to outlive you, Anne\" he declares and, without missing a beat, turns to young Laura and adds \"I'm not sure about you\". Still sharp-thinking mind even in delusion.It is heart-wrenching, however, to see him in the final scene, in the nursing home a few months after Anne has moved to Paris. Anthony's mind has regressed to a state of whimpering for \"mommy\", curdling in Catherine's arms. This scene reminds me at once of both Benjamin Button and the final scene of \"2001: A space odyssey\", a man coming full circle at the end of his life.The acting is uniformly excellent, and Hopkins beyond excellent. His completely immersed portrayal of Anthony fully deserves an Oscar to go with his BAFTA. We'll find out in less than 3 days. Coleman matches him tear for tear, smile for smile. Between the two of them, they break your heart again and again.Sewell who got my attention in the TV series \"Man in the high castle\" delivers a measured performance as Paul, not a particularly likeable character but comes across as understandably human. The dark side of this (and other) character is left to veteran Gatiss, who has under his credits two popular TV series \"Game of thrones\" and \"Sherlock\". Prolific Williams does not have anything to work with in the \"alternates\" in hallucination of Anne and Laura. But in the final scene, as experienced (perhaps even a bit world-weary) but still compassionate nursing home nurse Catherine, she has her shining moments. Imogen Poots is well-cast for Laura, young and fresh, but poised under pressure.",

His work in The Silence of the Lambs is iconic but I think his performance in this film can rival that.The Father follows Anthony, an ageing man who refuses assistance from his daughter Anne. As he tries to make sense of his changing circumstances, he begins to doubt his loved ones, his mind and even reality.This is genuinely one of the saddest and most painful films I've had to sit through. Based off his own play, Florian Zeller gives us a devastating film about dementia and one that I feel will connect with many people. I don't know anyone with this illness but I cannot imagine how difficult it must be for the person and the people around them to deal with this problem. There is a great amount of confidence displayed by Zeller in portraying this. The film does such a phenomenal job of putting us into the same perspective as Hopkins. Yorgos Lamprinos' editing is fantastic as the structure becomes more confusing. Locations and actors would change wth time going forwards and backwards. It was a great visual choice to have different actors play the same character as it captured the memory loss and confused state Hopkins was in. All of these elements combined gave so much more clarity to how it would feel having dementia. The script by Florian Zeller and Christopher Hampton is very well written. Every single piece of dialogue sounds incredibly natural making all of the characters feel like real people and that added to the emotional value of the story.The performances in conjunction with the dialogues make this film as emotional as can be. Anthony Hopkins delivers an astounding performance that feels all too real and depicts dementia to the best of his ability. There are some great subtleties in the way he delivers dialogues and even changes moods in a smooth manner. His acting in the ending alone where he breaks down after being unable to understand the world is enough to make anyone cry which is a further testament as to how great he is here. Olivia Colman is also excellent. She puts forth an incredible performance that showcases the pain and distress a daughter feels seeing her father in this state gracefully.The Father might just be my favourite film of 2020. It does such an amazing job putting the audience into the shoes of Hopkins' character and helping us get a better understanding of this illness. It's very depressing and I don't know if I want to go through this experience again. All I know is that Florian Zeller is a master storyteller and Hopkins deserves to win an Oscar.",

            "content": "What makes The Father a brilliant film is its unwavering depiction of an elderly man with dementia. The said man (oddly enough, named Anthony) is played by Sir Anthony Hopkins (who's picking up his second Academy Award win in his 80s), with fragmented episodes playing out to audiences exactly the way they would in front of his eyes. The deliberately disjointed narrative is the outcome of a masterfully penned screenplay by Florian Zeller (whose play \"Le P\u00e8re\", the film is based on) and Christopher Hampton - the information presented to us in tidbits keeps us wildly guessing all through.Performances complement the writing in uplifting the film. Apart from Hopkins, the most notable show is from Olivia Colman who plays Anne (Anthony's daughter). It also includes neat work from Imogen Poots, Olivia Williams, Rufus Sewell, and a few others. Editor Yorgos Lamprinos marvellously (dis)connects Anthony's fading memories and present events - faces, personas, settings, and situations changing within seconds of each other. Hopkins gracefully transitions between distressed, anxious, sad, and elated in a manner that, by all means, gives dementia a multi-layered perspective.The Father startled me in ways conventional psychological horror-thrillers wouldn't, with its overall disorientation. When I heard Anthony say \"..I feel as if I'm losing all my leaves\", it left me both restless and helpless. Restless, because I wanted Anthony to feel wholesome once again even for a few seconds, but that wasn't going to be the case. Helpless, because it could be you or me in the same situation later in life. When a film leaves that sort of aftertaste, it's either exceptionally good or downright horrible. In this case, it's the former.",

            "content": "Many films have been made about the last stages of life, but, it's hard to recall one which so doggedly adheres to capturing those last glimpses of a rational mind as does Florian Zeller's THE FATHER from the main character's own viewpoint. Adapted from his own play (with critical input from acclaimed screenwriter Christopher Hampton), Zeller focuses his entire attention on his title character, Anthony, magnificently performed by Oscar nominated Anthony Hopkins.The viewer is presented with Anthony as a widower and former engineer who is cared for by his loving daughter Annie (Olivia Coleman; also justly nominated) and a parade of day-care workers, including, most prominently, Laura (Imogen Poots). We also see Anthony in both his own flat and in that of Annie. The complex screenplay is never played strictly chronological, and there are other phantoms and figures lurking in the reaches of Anthony's mind. Scenes and dialogue are repeated, sometimes exactly, and other times with a twist. Events may be taking place over five years as easily as in one. The theme that every day is a \"new\" day for one with dementia is eloquently depicted. It's a difficult task for the actors as well, and they have to play everything straight or the movie would collapse. Hopkins, Coleman, Poots and the rest of the cast are all equal to the challenge and go beyond. Of particular note is Olivia Williams as another caregiver. Her screen-time is rather brief, but no less effective. Peter Francis' Production Design subtly but effectively portrays the confusion in Anthony's mind. Yorgos Lamprinos' editing is precise and there is a grace to Ben Smithard's cinematography and Ludovico Einaldi's score (abetted by some choice classical music).THE FATHER isn't a technical achievement (as well as it produced). It is a heartbreaking personal one. Zeller is the conductor here, but it is Hopkins who must play the notes. This is a case where one's familiarity with the actor and his long worthy career could have been a burden, but Hopkins easily allays any doubts, and, even when we recognize a bit or two from his acting repertoire, it only adds to the poignancy of the screenplay. As Hopkins descends deeper into the void, it comes not just with sadness, but, with sweet mercy for his soul.",

It's difficult to imagine how it would be to watch anyone who is going through this in real life; or indeed has a loved one with dementia. One of the things best aspects of this film is how, for the most part, we are watching the story from Anthony's perspective. We see him becoming confused and forgetful. With that comes a repetitiveness, often combined with confusion. As an audience we see events happen in different ways. We're not always sure about when things are happening, what time of day it is or how much time has passed. We see parts of the room change from scene to scene. Some of the actors and actresses change, signifying Anthony's inability to remember who people are. Sir Anthony Hopkins was magnificent in the role. Totally believable. Prior to watching this film, i always thought Chadwick Boseman deserved an Oscar for his performance, but now having seen this film, I have to rethink that idea as Sir Anthony Hopkins truly deserved his Best Actor Oscar. The supporting cast were also great. Technically, the production design and editing were brilliant. The way the sets and characters change from scene to scene means that we experience some of the confusion that he goes through was creative. The score was good too. Overall, a fantastically written, well acted and directed film. Highly recommended.",

Anthony Hopkins plays a 84 year old man ( his real age) battling dementia , senility and a fading memory where he keeps forgetting names, faces, events and even timelines. His is a performance full of nuances, subtle, refined and memorable. When told by daughter Anne that she is leaving for Paris, Anthony ( also his name in the film) is bitter and says that rats are abandoning ship. He also keeps talking about his late younger daughter as if she was still alive. The film should relate to everyone since we have all seen old relatives with similar ailments.Director Florian Zeller skillfully uses different actors for same characters within the confines of the claustrophobic London flat. The director brings out the angst, distress, confusion and frustration of Anthony so effectively as he weaves the riveting narrative. It is a treat to watch Anthony as he cajoles his carer and does some tap dancing for her.The location of this film is the flat, and for immensely talented Anthony this is his stage where he delivers his lines with mastery. ( Luckily for audience the verbal communication of Anthony is perfect ). The most touching moment is towards the end when Anthony breaks down in a sort of catharsis as the carer comforts him. \" I am losing all my leaves \" he says sadly.The camera and characters do not move out of the flat. Only once the camera moves to the window to look outside and see a little boy playing and Anthony smiles. The film has excellent cinematography , editing and sound.",

It doesn't simply describe how the character is feeling, but brings the viewer into his world and makes you feel the frustrating confusion of his declining state.The film takes place almost exclusively in a small apartment, so one wouldn't imagine the cinematography and set design would be much to bark at, but on the contrary, it becomes a storytelling device unto itself. It's just loaded with intricate details, and the tiny changes and parallels in the surroundings further draw us in to the character's condition.It is an absolutely heartbreaking film, both for how you sympathize with the onscreen drama, and how painfully realistic it all is.

Moreover, the film does not (just) treat Anthony as an object of pity-he is also a figure of conflict and causes pain for his love ones. The film has a messy reality to it that I rather like. Hopkins-in a good way-is a hot mess in this film and it is amazing how *much* of the gamut of humanity he goes through here.I am afraid however the film has no repeat viewing value. The more clearly you can put the narrative together the less you feel like Anthony-which defeats the point of the film.

Anthony Hopkins delivers a wonderful performance, its interpretation is spotless. You can see the pain in his expressions, the confusion in his eyes and gestures. It is a punch of reality, directly on your face. The director managed to depict the sickness in a meaningful and truthful way: Anthony has its good moments where he laughs and he is full of life, but then, the more we go on, the more we see his condition getting worse and worse: he loses track of time and space, he swap events and people in his life, he is not able to think logically. The ending is heartbreaking, I was in tears.It is scary to see what aging can do to some people. This movie is like a lucid nightmare. It is slow paced, and lets the audience sink deeper and deeper into a malfunctioning brain. I am speechless, Florian Zeller partially restored my hope in modern cinema. I am happy to see that the mainstream market is still able to deliver good stories. The cast is small, and every single actor plays a specific role that fits in the plot. Everyone had the perfect amount of screen time. If I have to find one weakness, it would be some dialogues lines in a couple of dialogues with professional carers, that are not very believable.

Trust the composition, your clouds will clear anyway, if not his, but then you have likely seen it already if you happen to be reading this.He's constantly fighting in this movie, for his own sanity in effect, though it always seems that the world around him is tricking him.The movie wraps with his degeneration to infantilism, and you might sense that the only light that filters in comes with this hyper-vulnerable senile nascence, that fuses with his sense of impending death, and terrible yearning to go home.It's a brilliant portrait, in a career marked by brilliance, and a movie of substance and value and amazing accuracy; one medical and emotional bullseye after another; a great flick.",

I couldn't get over what a brilliant concept for a film it was. Dementia is a truly heart-breaking condition and to be put in the shoes of the character who has is not only fascinating, it is also important I think. It's great that people can understand what others are going through and relate to their struggles. The way they did that here was masterful.Anthony Hopkins in the lead role is truly incredible. He has been nominated for Best Actor at the Academy Awards and he thoroughly deserves it. Most years with a performance this good he would've been a lock to win it as well. This is one of those performances where he is so good that you actually have to keep constantly reminding yourself that he doesn't actually have this condition. Olivia Colman has also been nominated for Best Supporting Actress. She is also really good in this film. Her role isn't quite as easy to shine in, but nonetheless she finds a way. Her heart-break over the situation becomes our heart-break as an audience.The way this film is structured is nearing perfection. It's so clever and every time you think you have it figured out it hits you from a different angle you hadn't seen coming. The final scene in this movie is one of the most devastating scenes I've ever seen in a movie. This is an incredible film that isn't just a must-see, it's mandatory viewing in my opinion.

Yes I get it, there's meant to be confusion because it's really supposed to emphasize how an individual with dementia and/or Alzheimer's would feel. I think they did an excellent job highlighting the fear that comes with this type of condition, and the family challenges that may develop. I'd consider it more of an educational movie with plain avenues of entertainment versus a jaw-dropping, box office breaking film.

But, no, The Father is the real deal. An actual masterpiece that - despite the difficult subject matter - I can't wait to watch again.The non-linear storytelling this film employs is truly incredible. The movie manages to be confusing and disorienting, yet understandable at the same time. We follow Anthony (Hopkins) as he struggles to make sense of the events in front of him; time jumps and skips, characters swap faces, things happen and then don't. It's an incredible experience, rooted entirely in empathy. God forbid any of us go through this when we age, but it's at least a window. The Father represents the ultimate purpose for tragic art itself: to understand, contextualize, empathize...to prepare ourselves.The performances in this film are next level. Anthony Hopkins absolutely deserved his Oscar for this; the way he stares off into space or how his mood changes and the audience doesn't need dialog to see this is remarkable. He's not a likeable character; one thing I really appreciated about this film is how it doesn't sugarcoat or glorify the mentally ill. He's a jerk, difficult to live with or appreciate, save for those moments where the memory of the man he was shines through. That feels distressingly real to me. Hopkins imbues this character with such humanity, I feel like he's a real person. I honestly forgot at times this was a performance. Olivia Coleman is also wonderful, as she is in basically everything.I also thought this was a wonderfully written and edited film. It is paced so well and never feels dull or slow. It's moving constantly and the audience is just as confused as Anthony is by the passage of time. Making this film truly one that grabs and holds your attention from the get go. If you were getting sick of me heaping praise on this one, I also really liked the set design. It feels like an expertly put together stage play at times and the subtle distinctions in the set is such a wonderful and creative touch.GAH. I love this movie so much.The Bad: Honestly, I'd be nitpicking at this point. I did think Imogen Poots' performance is maybe the weakest here and I kind wished we saw more of her. But, that's really all I can think of.The Ugly: The Father is a tough watch, especially for those with elderly parents or grandparents who've gone through this debilitating ailment. For that reason alone, I'd say it's not for everyone. Yet, I think it's necessary for everyone to experience difficult subject matter and honestly, I felt more hopeful by the end of this film than anything.The Father might be the most life affirming film I've seen in ages; the ultimate message being that decline and death is inevitable. All we know for certain is the time we have right now. Spend time with your loved ones, take chances, live your life. Because we will all hit a point where we can't anymore. I think that's beautiful.",

He gets rid of Caretakers because he doesn't like them. His daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) takes care of him, but needs to have him put into a home where she can live her life and he will be, hopefully, happy there.In the beginning we believe everything we see and hear according to Anthony's way of seeing things. Takes a few minutes for us to realize there are things we cannot really see or hear. Because Mr. Hopkins is what he is even when in Anthony's character, who has Dementia, the way he sees and says things we believe him. After a while we realize our mistake and we have to keep fighting this belief.Notables: Rufus Sewell as Paul, Anne's former husband who Anthony sees as real and, who tells Paul that Anne will move to Paris to be with another man and Paul tells Anthony that he, knows nothing about Paris and that Anthony is living in Paul's flat, but Anthony still believes he is in his own flat; Mark Gatiss as Bill, Anne's current husband, who asks Anthony how long will he (Anthony) live off Anne; and later Bill tells Anne that Anthony should be in a home for others to care for him; Imogene Poots as Laura, the only Caretaker Anthony likes and misses when she is no longer there and Anthony sees another woman who calls herself that Laura; Olivia Williams as Catherine, as the Nurse at the Nursing Home, who simulates Anthony's mother in the way she soothes Anthony, And there is a scene where Olivia Williams plays Anthony's daughter Anne, and Anthony does not recognize the difference. See? Will you notice?Some of the scenes are confusing, but all will straighten out in time. I am still not sure if Anne is actually married to Bill or not. I do kind of wish Mr. Hopkin's character was not named Anthony for obvious reasons.This is very sad, tragic, heart wrenching and we are at a loss like Anthony because no matter what Caretakers do, it's really not enough. As we watch this, we not only see a confused Anthony and his daughter Anne who fights back tears all the time, we think of the many families out there who have the same or similar problems with a loved family member and feel helpless.Anthony Hopkins received the Oscar for Best Actor Award for this story. For a while I thought that almost any actor could perform the job as good as anyone else, but I was wrong. This time Anthony Hopkins brought something else to the story - a kind of new dimension - and I felt as though he was my family member and I was as helpless as we saw Anne helplessly deal with everything.This was probably the best performance ever by Mr. Anthony Hopkins.

I'm trying to avoid discussing the avant-garde method The Father uses to induce the kind of confusion that comes with Alzheimer's, mostly because I don't want to spoil the effect for anyone who hasn't seen this film yet. Needless to say, things make sense...eventually. The point isn't to understand it; it's to empathize with the main character. Of course, with the current era being what it is, even this fails to break through the dislike of the entitled, old white guy who ends up making things difficult for everyone around him. Anthony Hopkins certainly nails this role (especially at the end), and all the supporting characters are equally as strong in their performances. It's just that the role of an elderly white man is played almost too well. The stubbornness that Hopkins' character exudes is so frustrating as to make him entirely unsympathetic. If anything, I almost relate more to Paul (Rufus Sewell), who sees the detrimental effect Anthony is having on his daughter, Anne (Olivia Colman). I can only hope that I don't suffer from the same stubbornness when I get to the age where my mind is failing because it is not a good look on anyone. A confusing but ultimately enlightening look into Alzheimer's, I give The Father 3.5 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "Move over \"Suspiria,\" \"The Conjuring\" and \"Hereditary\" - there's a new film that has claimed the title as the scariest movie of the past decade. It's not demons, witches or serial killers that make this new movie scary; it's something that has affected our loved ones and may affect us in the future: dementia.\"The Father\" is a triumphant directorial debut by Florian Zeller, who puts us within the deteriorating mental state of our main character, Anthony. We experience his confusion as if it were our own. The film also takes on the perspective of the caretakers who are left helpless as they try to aid Anthony in making sense of a world he cannot recognize anymore.Zeller's play \"The Father\" debuted in Paris in 2012 to rapturous reviews. Its success spurred an acclaimed Broadway run with Frank Langella winning a Tony award for his performance. Now Zeller, with the help of esteemed screenwriter Christopher Hampton, has taken his stage play to the screen.At the center of the film playing the character of Anthony is veteran actor Anthony Hopkins (Zeller was so adamant about getting Hopkins for the role that he renamed the character specifically for him).With a nearly 60-year career in the rearview, including notable roles as Hannibal Lecter in \"The Silence of the Lambs\" and Richard Nixon in Oliver Stone's aptly named \"Nixon,\" Hopkins' performance here may be his very best. He is charismatic, fierce and vulnerable, sometimes all at the same time.If not for Chadwick Boseman's untimely death and larger-than-life performance in \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,\" Hopkins would be the undisputed favorite to win his second Oscar this year.The world we see is through Anthony's eyes. Initially, his world is quiet and still, often filled with days listening to classical music in his luxurious London flat and taking walks in the nearby park. After a while, however, things slowly start to come apart. He's displacing items more regularly, days are getting harder to separate and conversational details are getting lost in the shuffle.One day, his daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) tells him she's leaving London to go live in Paris with her new significant other. Feeling he's being abandoned, Anthony is hurt by his daughter's decision. The next morning, however, Anthony is still in his flat and has no recollection of Paris.Maybe that conversation happened a long time ago or never happened at all. Maybe this isn't Anthony's flat - maybe it's Anne's and she's taken him in to stay with her. Maybe she has a husband here named James (or is it Paul?) and she's now being played by a different actress than before.Like a Charlie Kaufman or Christopher Nolan film, Zeller plays with time and setting to tell his story. Conversations are repeated several times over from different perspectives, adding another level to the complex task of discerning what is fact and what is fiction.Anthony's physical surroundings seem to be rearranging at impossible speeds and the chronology of events is becoming increasingly muddled. Production designer Peter Francis and editor Yorgos Lamprinos deserve immense credit for their work here as their craftsmanship helps tell a complicated story.The confusion and frustration that Anthony feels are equally placed onto us as we are never sure what is happening and what order it is happening in. It's like watching a balloon being inflated and waiting for it to pop, yet it never does as your anxiety keeps building.It's a terrifying and heartbreaking process to watch as Anthony's mood begins to darken. He never knows what is going to come next and what has just happened. He's left in a perpetual state of fright and feels that everyone is out to get him.Those around him are equally as confused and scared as he is. Anne doesn't know what to do with her father and is fighting a losing battle of keeping an optimistic look at things. Colman, a recent Oscar winner for her role in \"The Favourite,\" acts somewhat as our guide through this mess. Imogen Poots, Olivia Williams, Mark Gatiss and Rufus Sewell all play well-cast supporting roles.Like \"Schindler's List\" and \"Requiem for a Dream,\" \"The Father\" is a superb film that you will only want to watch once. Its subject matter may hit too close to home for some viewers or be an introduction for others. No matter your familiarity, the film's take on dementia and the toll it places on everyone involved is so incredibly well done that it demands to be seen.",

Having to comprehend the rationality behind the various objects, characters, and relationships was my main point of focus, which started to fatigue as a barrage of irrelevant information overwhelmed me. Another of the movie's emphasis was the complicated, discreet while mutually estranged kinship, which was implied though quite obvious. Colman put up a dejected, insecure, yet affecting-yearning daughter, swaying between filial piety and emancipation; Hopkins performed the father in gradual oblivion, losing memory, time, sanity, as his self-awareness fractured in the face of mortifying conversions and perceptions. Overall, exquisite performances, but the middle section was rather dull.",

If like me, you're a perhaps little more emotionally cold, and watch drama with a sense of detachment, then you're not going to be moved but you will see some very good acting from Anthony Hopkins.This should work for me. Hopkins has always reminded me of my father and my father faced some mental decline toward the end. Parts of it are quite good but what lets it down for me is the script. I know it's an award winning play but so many of the characters around 'The Father' talk to him in unrealistic ways. What they say is not totally unbelievable, but it's not natural either. Even though he's been in decline for a while they all seem surprised every time he forgets something. If you've dealt with this sort of thing, even once, you roll with it. You explain what you need to explain, what you think will get through, and you move on. You don't act all surprised that a man who's losing his memory has forgotten something again.It's somewhat off-putting and serves to remind you that the playwright is making a point rather than an observation.I get that it's mostly from his point of view, but with better direction the actors could have played it with a more realistic world-weariness that comes from dealing with this stuff every day, without seeming like they were trying to explain and reveal things to the audience.It's still a good film and should hold most people's attention to the end. Those who get caught up in the story may miss the obvious clues on the 'twists', but it's not a film where the plot really matters. It's more about creating a sense of empathy. And based on that, and the fact that that aspect of the film failed for me, I can only rate it 5. Which is not to say it's good or bad. It's a solid film. It just didn't personally connect with me.",

Rufus plays Olivia's husband and Imogen is a caretaker hired to take care of Anthony. Anthony starts believing that Olivia & Rufus are trying to take advantage of him by making him think he is crazy and have him institutionalized-so that they can take his apartment.

The first half was especially hecka confusing, and the second half filled in some of the pieces.This disorienting and nonlinear story telling was meant to make us see what Anthony Hopkins's character saw, and the director was really good at that aspect. This showed the biggest theme of the movie, which was how sad and anxious life could be for people with dementia. With how sad the story turned out, the story helped me to have a glimpse at the life of many elder people with dementia.And of course the story wouldn't be convincing and powerful without Anthony Hopkins's phenomenal performance as the father. I definitely saw an old man with dementia who tried to maintain his sanity, but slowly lost it. As creepy as Hopkins was in Science of the Lambs, here he was very sad and made us felt for him.Another good performance was from Olivia Colman, who played the daughter. We saw the pain that she went through dealing with the situation, and I again felt bad for her character. This shows another important theme about the effect of the condition on the loved ones around the patient.Overall, a purposefully disorganized plot that showed the negative effect of dementia. 8/10.",

We frequently see him to look for his watch and I think this is symbolism for trying to remember when all these things happened. His memories is so messed up and some of his thoughts may haven't had happened at all.The scene where he is crying and he wants his mommy like a little boy it's really intens. The nurse calls him \"baby\" and tell him that \"everything is gonna be alright\" like a mom would do. I think about it and it really breaks my heart.No words about Anthony Hokings one of the best actors of all times. He should definitely win an Oscar. Olivia Coleman is very good too.In colcusion, this movie it may be one of the saddest things I have ever seen but its masterpiece. The actors, the editing, the directing they are all wonderful.",

And how it can impact his surrounding. Florian Zeller combined his directorial skills and artistic vision with Ben Smithard' steady work of cinematography to bring the senses of confusion and ignorance to the viewer, so that we would feel gradually a pure and sincere connection with the main character. Putting Anthony Hopkins' performance aside, the whole cast from Olivia Colman to Rufus Sewell did a brilliant job.A truly fantastic work that deserves all its awards and nominations this year.",

So I have avoided the subject for 60yrs.But quality films like this one are extremely difficult to find these days, and I figured Anthony Hopkins would be good for it (didn't know he won an Oscar for it, as I don't keep up with the mostly corrupt awards industry), so I had to give it a go. I was on the edge of my seat from the beginning, and stayed there until the very end. It is the most realistic portrayal of dementia I have ever seen. My dad is stuck on me being 35 (I am 68), so he's in a time machine not in his control. This film brought it very close, and helped me understand my dad's mind.I rarely give a film 10*, but this one is close to being perfect in every way.My favorite Hopkins film/performance is Remains of the Day. But this may be a new one, although much more difficult to re-watch. Hopkins is masterful here, as ever, but he's calling on all of his acting experience to deliver an effortless (seemingly!) performance. Nothing over the top, no melodrama, just one of the best crafted characters I've seen. He has help from a great script, direction, editing, sets, and co-stars, but the focus is Anthony. His character is as broad as it is deep, but so skilled is Hopkins that it seems effortless. I'm very grateful that Hopkins agreed to do this very difficult role, at his age. He could just sit on his laurels now.My age and health, as well as family members, begs many questions about aging and quality of life, which this film inherently, but without stating, highlights. I hope we can find ways for the mind to keep up with the longevity of our bodies, or provide for an acceptable alternative to warehousing our endless last days of confusion.",

            "content": "\"The Father\" is a new movie, well from 2020, and a co-production between the United Kingdom and France. The movie runs for under 100 minutes, so not a particularly long film by any means. And yet this was one of the biggest players from the previous awards season. The director is Florian Zeller and his career path can really be described as unusual. He launched his career through stage plays and mostly focused on these as well in recent years, even if here and there he also moved on to movies. So the smallest surprise here is probably that he wrote the screenplay himself. The bigger surprise is that he directed. And he did not have a co-director despite not being experienced at all in this department, but a co-writer. That would be Christopher Hampton and he has been in the industry for a long time and even won an oscar decades ago. Well, he won his second now. This is how successful this film turned out in the end and how audiences, critics and awards bodies loved it. Huge international breakthrough for Zeller too of course and we will see what will be next for him in the future. Certainly promising projects coming up. But as much as Zeller may have achieved behind the camera and with the pen in his hand (metaphorically), the heart and soul of this film was British actor Anthony Hopkins. You see him on the right of the imdb poster of course. He won his second Oscar for his portrayal here and even if he did not go into Oscar night as the frontrunner, not too many neutral observers were unhappy with Hopkins being announced as the winner at the very end, even after the Best Picture winner was announced this time. Hopkins was not there in America, maybe partially because of the pandemic and partially because of his age and the distance, but he recorded a little thank you message the following day if I remember correctly in which he also made a short reference to the late Chadwick Boseman that most people were expecting to win. More on Hopkins later.The woman you see on the left is Olivia Colman of course, already an Oscar winner herself and her win for The Favorite as an against-the-odds upset as well, so kinda fitting. I think she played her part well as she always does, but I don't see huge versatility in her somehow and it feels a bit exaggerated how much awards bodies have loved her in the past. Still she contributed in a way where the film does not get worse when she is on screen and here and there she also has a memorable moment, like the one in the elevator for example with her bright smile after she gets a compliment from her father. That was one of not too many moments where we really saw how much he meant to her and how much she wanted to be loved by him. Despite the violent fantasy. Nice connection to how she in reality(?) takes really good care of him when he is in bed. Another example would be the table argument of course. But as a whole the fact how much she cares for him is also shown to us by all the time where we see them both on the screen, even if they are separated in the end and even if we can never really be sure what is reality and what happens only in Hopkins's character's mind. This is pretty much the key aspect to the script here. I cannot write the mindf... word from beginning to end, but it's all about that. Zeller's main intention here was definitely to make us see things the way they are seen from the perspective of an old man whose memory and sanity are fading quickly. We also see all the emotions he goes through in the process. Be it him joking around before becoming very serious seconds alter (the tap dance scene), be it him saying he is an intelligent man and how he does not want to be treated like a fool. The nun reference there also felt a bit random. But also those moments in which he is as vulnerable as it gets. When he is physically attacked, slapped, though (probably) only in his imagination, or when he, near the very end, compares himself to a tree basically and realizes how he is fading basically. These are all moments in which Hopkins truly shines.As for all the inclusions that do so much with your mind, I will also mention a few examples: Of course, the recurring watch references come to mind. But also the painting from the wall. All the references to his other daughter and how he sees her a bit in a new applicant. Or actually sees her a lot and how confused he is when he sees the other woman near the end. Then there is this loop scene which I also found fairly haunting to be honest when we have his daughter and her man talk about him and how he enters the room when they do. Would they really talk that loudly and even scream immediately afterwards with him not too far away? Anyway, this scene closes with him not taking his seat the way he did before, but going back to his room. By the way, in the trailer this film seemed to be much more about the apartment, but it turned out completely differently. The only thing related to reality clashing with an old mind was maybe when we saw the other daughter (let's call her that) briefly on one occasion. There are many more moments really I could list here, but I don't want to take it away from you if you have not seen the film yet. Or also not take it away from you to draw your own conclusions. I must say that in the second half, I felt it became a bit too much honestly with how everything gets blurry and not too close to reality anymore. For example the scene towards the end (but still a bit earlier and away fro the closing credits) when we see Hopkins' character alone all on his own at an utterly cold and sterile retirement home. This of course gave us in the audience immediately the idea that this is where he was all along, that maybe Colman's character never really existed, but then things take another turn and twist. One after the other. I don't know, maybe I like it more if I watch it again, but I thought that perhaps Zeller wanted a bit too much here. Had almost Nolan proportions with stuff like Inception, only as a full-on family drama.Aside from that, I think this is a pretty interesting project also as a stage play and I would not be surprised if we see it one day at non-movie theaters. Surely a challenge with some characters, even if it's not that many, and also the changing locations of course. I see that Zeller turned this into a film already in France years ago. Interesting. This seems almost lost though judging from the amiunt of votes here on imdb. But back to this one here: By the way, when Colman's character leaves in the end it felt like closure and a framework compared to how she entered the movie. But the film ends with Hopkins' character of course and a beautiful shot of the nature outside his new home. Fitting really. This seems like a film really close to his heart. The birthday his character states is his own in fact and he may be healthier in terms of his mental state, but also his character's name is Anthony. A bit of an irony if we take a look at another Oscar-winning movie, namely Nomadland, and how there everybody has their real name except the protagonist, even if it is not too different either. Let's sta with this one here for now though. What else can you say? Oh yes, Imogen poots is always a nice inclusion, not just for a hetero male like myself, but also acting-wise. Very nice. This also applies to the rest of the cast, especially Sewell and Gatiss who held their own next to Hopkins (and Colman) and this is a really huge achievement I'd say. No matter if it was two scenes or ten.All in all, this movie gets a thumbs-up with no hesitation, even if I somehow feel that I did not like the outcome overall as much as I would have liked and some of the awards recognition is also too much, especially for the screenplay. I felt that it even took away a bit from the emotional component because the fictitious aspects (and how we cannot be sure what's happening at all the longer the movie goes) made it a bit less depressing. For me at least. Difficult to really put a finger on it. I wonder how I will think about that on rewatch, but I have no intention really to go for a rewatch anytime soon. Who knows, maybe once it is on television. This is not a visual masterpiece, so it's not much of a worse watch on the small screen than at a movie theater where I saw it today I believe. The music I did not like too much, but that is of course entirely subjective. High-pitched opera is smply not my thing. But of course it makes sense that the character likes it with his age. They could not have gone for modern pop music or something and it also fits from the cultivated perspective if we look at his really fancy apartment and fairly exquisite alcoholic beverages you see here and there. What will always stay the most with this one here though is how Hopkins turned solid scenes into something exquisite at times. Great props to him and it will take quite some time to find a better performance by somebody in his 80s. May he lives for many more years to come and maybe also give us a few more nice films hopefully. Or just enjoy retirement. Whatever floats his boat the most. Thank you, Mr Hopkins!",

Both Olivia Coleman and Anthony Hopkins put on superb performances, arguably their best, and create utterly plausible and empathetic characters.The story structure is quite unique, almost a suspense thriller, that immediately engages you and leaves you guessing up to the ending. This alone is worth watching it for, especially fans of filmmaking, as it's not an easy trick to pull off.While many will discount this film for being a downer, it's the very subject matter many of us need to understand and discuss, from how we handle mental illness to the way we treat our elderly.",

Hopkins acts the ever changing mood and behaviours which not only is terrifying for those with dementia but for those who try to hold on to the love they have for the person they used to be. The decision to hand over the care of that person as they are now to complete strangers and an unfamiliar environment if far from easy but is often necessary as the conflict between loving and loyalty gives way to accepting that without doing so, risks sacrificing what time and happiness you have.This is a film, alongside Amour should be part of any curriculum for those studying for a career in caring, whether that be medicine, nursing or social care.

Florian Zeller manages to capture this experience magnificently here in this film adaptation of the play Le P\u00e8re which he co-wrote with fellow playwright Christopher Hampton.Anthony Hopkins is everything in this film - funny, charming and also utterly heart-breaking - he completely deserves his Oscar win after putting in what will surely be remembered as one of his all time great performances. The way we enter his seemingly coherent mind and reality only to watch it gradually unravel until he is left as a broken man unsure of his own existence is stunning. Praise also has to be reserved for Olivia Colman who has to portray the daughter having to watch her father go through this nightmare. Some of her best work is done when she is not speaking, but instead letting her face do the talking. She could have easily won a second Oscar for her role here.The original score from Ludovico Einaudi is also great (but I love everything that man does) and I liked the use of the set design to illustrate the subtle differences in the constantly shifting and changing reality we inhabit for those 97 minutes.The entire screening was completely stunned into silence as the credits started rolling, as everyone was trying to come to terms with what we had just seen.

            "content": "As good as this was, what was missing for me was an acknowledgement that what we're seeing is advanced dementia, and particularly severe at that - someone who is not just frightened, confused and forgetful, but paranoid, aggressive and suspicious. The film perfectly captures what the final 6 weeks with my dad were like before he went into care, and how he often continued to behave while in care. It also conveys how frightening a large aggressive man with dementia can be to those trying to care for him, as well as the terror of alienation when a loved one with dementia turns against you. As a couple of other reviewers have commented, most of the characters don't handle the man's condition well and act in ways that make him more agitated - the fact that even experienced care professionals are shown repeatedly asking him \"What do you mean?\" and \"Do you remember?\", and being surprised that he forgets things even when his condition is clearly severe, simply isn't realistic and is used to artificially drive the point home. There's no sense that his family and carers have acclimatised to the situation and learned to modify their behavior, when in fact that's one of the first things that happens when you have a loved one with dementia.Because the film is designed as an immersive experience from the perspective of someone highly agitated with severe dementia, what's missing are all the moments of joy and love in between. There's no recognition in the film that many people have much gentler manifestations of dementia, and can live for years with dementia with a good quality of life. This film will terrify people and generate huge fear around dementia, and I really want to emphasise that although many psychological and behavioral aspects ring true, it represents an extreme scenario (one more reminiscent of Lewy Body dementia than Alzheimer's) and that having dementia doesn't have to be like this. I know people with dementia who still actively pursue and enjoy their hobbies and who have put all kinds of practical coping strategies in place (either independently or with their family's support) to ensure they can carry out their daily activities safely. I know people who have had dementia for many years, whose short-term memory is completely shot and who are reliant on others for help with certain tasks, but who can still cook, garden, read, do puzzles, follow politics and current affairs, engage with friends and family, and generally take an interest in the world - and who enjoy their day almost every day. That's what dementia can be too, and what it is for many, not just an unremitting horror show. Please don't think it has to be this bad, at least not all the time.",

The cynical way he is treated by his daughters husband shows the lack of time and patiance we tend to have and the kindness shown by the nurse at the end also highlights the patience and skill needed to truly look after those with dementia.From what I know of dementia I'd say this was the most accurate portrayal I have ever seen and he certainly deserved his Oscar.",

            "content": "The father is a masterpiece. Period. If black comunity is angry because the Academy doesn't give the Oscar to Chadwick Boseman is because Antonhy Hopkins' performance on this film is just superb. Sorry. Boseman doesn't deserve an Oscar for a just right performance. If you can't deal with that, sorry. In a scale of 1 to 10, Boseman has a 6 or 6.5. Hopkins is beyond 10. This is the lifetime performance on which every actor would like to arrive in his silver years.The film is about an old man who starts to lose control of his mind, and what mr. Hopkins delivers is just impressive. Not only the world of confussion, regression, and halucinations, but the very frailty of human condition are portrayed with supreme craftmanship, but with a big understanding of what all these means in the eyes of the surrounding familiars and the spectator. The most oustanding feature on Hopkins displayed is the absolute dignity and humanity of his character. The most impressive thing about the film is the slow crescendo on which Anthony (Anthony Hopkins) is involved, which ends with that astonishing monologue on which he claims for her mother. I can say that that is one of the most incredible scenes I have ever seen in my entire life. I almost burst in tears when look the absolute loniless and frailty of his character. I came back to this at the end of mi review.Is an impreessive accomplishment from one of the most relevant actors of the last half century. Doesn't deserve that performance the highest acknowledge from the Academy? That's what what's happened in the 2021 Academy ceremony. Few awards reward such oustanding performance, and that's hasn't to be with racial issues but with a supreme actoral craftmanship.Nevertheless, I have to say that The Father barely rose the real ordeal on which patient and family members have to get through on this illness. BTW, senil dementia is not anymore an accepted term in psychiatry, because normalize something that is not normal. Instead, modern psychatry suggest Brain damage with 3 levels: minimun, medium and great or severe brain damage, since not all the ancients suffer from this. Other thing on which the film fails is in the treatment to release the patient from this condition on hallucinations, confusion and mental regressions. That's not cure or relief with pills but with haloperidol, wich stabilizes the brain and help the patient to avoid suffer from this symptoms. It's so obvious that the film doesn't want to deeper on this condition, instead it suggest the part on wich all involved in this condition suffers. In that, Anthony Hopkin's performance is absolute devastating. The film accomplish in show us how frailty is our humanity and the suffering both the patient and the family, portraying both with such respect and human dignity that very few films attempt.By personal experience, my mother recently has that kind of episodes, everyone is a truly nightmare with a length from ten to 16 hours on wich my mother and us, her family, were driven, I can say that the film doesn't explore that nightmerish experience. The final scene on which Hopkins cry for her mommy is an exactly portrarit of the ordeal on which my mother was driven by this illness, and is absolutely devastanting, one of the most impressive and painfully scenes I have ever watched.Never an actor has deserved more an award that the 2021 Oscar for mr. Anthony Hopkins. There is no point of comparison between his performance and that of the late mr. Chadwick Boseman. Just can't be compared. It's not a racial issue, but an artistic all in all, and in that field, mr. Hopkings delivers his most impressive performance. A masterclass in acting. Best male (or female) acting of the XXI century by far. Period.",

It's truly astounding how this movie allows the viewer to feel a bit like a person who is actually suffering from dementia.

Anthony Hopkins deserves all the awards for this performance because he goes through so much emotionally in this movie and all of it felt right.If I were to complain about anything when it comes to The Father (aside from the fact that it is about a subject which is hard to watch) it would be that sometimes the way the story is told feels too smart for its own good. Getting things that happened in the past confused with the present is realistic for the main character, but when he starts mixing things he wouldn't experience until the future into his present circumstances that didn't make sense. However, it still worked for me because it muddled things enough for the audience so we were in the shoes of the protagonist. I genuinely found myself afraid when he was left alone because I knew that another disorienting change could hit him in a matter of moments. The Father is a great film that is only hard to recommend because not everyone can emotionally handle this kind of story, since it feels so authentic.",

What makes The Father different from other films that deal with the diseases like dementia is that it doesn't just focus on the experience of family members. It is centred on the sufferer of dementia, which is very believable and at no point feel forced or saccharine. The emotions within the film are wideranging. There are some warm-hearted, even funny parts to Anthony's character, punctuated by the sadness in learning that he is unable to control the ability to discern the real from the figments created by his disease. While the film deals with a very uncomfortable topic it is worth every bit of viewing time and reminds us that we need to treat people who suffer from this terrible disease humanely.",

This creates confusion in the audience, which is the intended effect. I think this movie is a great way of showing people what dementia is like and just how horrible it can be.As for negatives, I honestly can't think of any.

            "content": "We don't just lose our memories when our brains deteriorate. Sometimes memories are corrupted; misplaced. Sometimes they appear to get repeated. In any case, we lose our ability to perceive the world - and our very lives - as we once did.We can discuss the existential implication of the way our minds operate another time (I have a friend who believes the human brain could be rewired to perceive time nonlinearly but still be considered functional, though I would have some questions on logistics and semantics there). I'm only here to tell you about The Father, one of the best films of this year's #KeepingUpWithTheOscars marathon and one of the most moving portrayals of dementia since Haneke's Amour (2012). Notably, this one lets us see things from the dementia patient's point of view.This is the first film Florian Zeller has directed, although it is based on a similarly named stage play of his. Sometimes (as with Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, another multi-category Oscar nominee, from the same playwright as 2016's Fences), this can be almost too obvious; the scenery rarely changes and not much \"happens\", per se.But The Father has nightmarish sequences worthy of Kaufman's I'm Thinking of Ending Things. I don't know how some of these scenes must have looked on a live stage, but they might've made me forget I was watching real people perform with little-to-no magic involved. It's hard for any of us to remember going to live shows in general, but you know what I mean.Anthony Hopkins gives what's possibly his finest performance since Hannibal Lecter, in the role of a British geezer named Anthony (perhaps indicating that Hopkins himself is beginning to muse on these things). But instead of a menacing force of evil, this is a character we all recognize too well from real life; a stubborn old goat who's certain he doesn't need any help, even as he begins to lose track of his recent memories, and soon also distant ones.Time is played around with in other ways throughout the film, but I dare not reveal too much. I can tell you that Anthony's daughter, played by the always-phenomenal Olivia Colman, begins to appear to him with different faces, different life plans, and even different husbands. Sometimes he doesn't remember the faces he's shown; sometimes he remembers them from the wrong places. The plot makes us wonder if someone is messing with him; gaslighting him until he must be dumped in a nursing home to live out his deterioration in solitude.People often wonder, what's even the point of a film like The Father? These days especially, surely escapist entertainment or something hopeful is what we need? This, to me, indicates a narrow understanding of film, presuming that filmmakers must never make films for themselves; that their duty is always to entertain, instead of translating their thoughts and worries into an artistic expression.Films like that aren't always fun, I agree. But The Father is legitimately powerful and clever in its presentation - and for some of us (especially if we're currently going through something eerily similar to what's being explored), watching a movie like it is a reminder that there are people out there who understand. It's not an Avengers sequel, but I assure you those are still around.",

Empathize much more with the character and the pain is shared. It is a script that, as I said at the beginning, confuses but achieves emotions with the situation and with the main character, for my taste I prefer something more linear but I admit that it convinces and captivates.The color palette is magnificent, everything accompanies the scenes and vibes of the characters.Anthony Hopkins is not surprising, he is simply the acting beast that we are used to. Every time it generates more pain to see him and his face of not understanding and not knowing why, the final scene of him asking for his mother destroys you, 10 points.However, on the side of Olivia Colman I left much to be desired, I do not know if it was the expectations for what was said or that but her character did not reach me, I feel that I achieve emotions but not to the maximum, each scene that appeared a break for know more about her character, it was cut. I did not finish meeting that daughter with so much pain, I do not know if it was the script that failed to highlight her character or the linear interpretation of Colman that left me nothing but a neat performance.",

Somebody could play the perfect performance as Hamlet, for instance, but if he's playing to an audience that doesn't like Shakespeare nobody is going to care how great his performance is.

A lot of people will go to see it just based on the name of the stars but most of them won't want to stick around to figure out what it was supposed to be about. My wife's mother had Dementia and her brother cared for her by himself and eventually with a carer for years before she died, so they might empathize with it.

And how confident should we be that this is true?The film progresses with a sense of temporal dysphoria. People come and go, disappear, change names, change faces, change attitudes, and sometimes, events completely contradict one another. However, our character remains confident in his sanity, and instead reacts to this seemingly changing world with hostility, some of which falls on his own daughter.This is a powerful example of how changing the reference frame from which a story is told can paint a clearer picture. Often, we watch mentally unstable characters through the eyes of others, and in our minds, create the association that that character is very odd, in comparison with our narrator, the other person. If we instead tell the story from the point of view of that so-called mentally unstable person, then they are completely sane, yet almost the entire world around them is incomprehensibly peculiar. Which of the two stories do you think emphasises the extent of the psychological disorder? In the case of The Father, it is by far the latter.The movie ends with a touching soliloquy, which probably secured Hopkins his Oscar for the performance. \"I feel as if I'm losing my leaves\" he cries, as he begs for his mother - as a man in his 80s. In the end, our character finally admitted that he was ill, and for a brief moment before the end, things seemed normal. We can hope that he came to terms with himself, and found some sense of peace, in the days he had left on this Earth.",

It is confusing but that is exactly the state of mind of the main character. We see the entire film out of his perspective. Just like him we are lost in the twilight zone between reality, memories, misinterpretation and fantasy. There is no straight line in this film and this is exactly how a person suffering from dementia must experience the world around him. In this way the film is perfect and it is something we never saw before. Another aspect which makes the film perfect are the performances. First of all you have heavy weight actor Anthony Hopkins playing the role of the protagonist. It is amazing how Hopkins portrays this role. The switch between all kind of different emotions that all feel so real and natural. He perfectly let me enter the mind of his character and you felt with him. It was like watching a real person. Hopkins is fantastic. Many say its his best since \"The Silence of the Lambs\". I am saying it is his best performance. Period.Olivia Colman was also wonderful, Not sure if she is supporting, its definitely borderline. But nevertheless its a very heartbreaking performance of a daughter who looks for the right solution and who is caring but that care is not recognized nor is it appreciated nor is it understood. Its a helpless situation her character finds herself in and Colman wonderfully brought that helplessness on screen in just the same believable way. Watching both brilliant actors shooting their acting weapons at each other is just a phenomenon of itself.The whole ensemble is fantastic. Notable mentions especially to Oliver Williams who is very underrated for her role but especially in the last third she really captures the screen with her tenderness. Great job. The direction is perfect. The way the film is set up is not an easy task to portray such a realistic confusion and transmit it to the audience surely isn't either.

            "content": "Technically, The Father is well made, with good quality direction, cinematography, editing and sets. But the script, acting and general atmosphere left me cold. Already too long at 1 hour 37 minutes, this movie is the cinematic equivalent of falling into depression over several hours (it actually feels like centuries). One of the UK's most over-rated actors, Anthony Hopkins, executes his lines with his usual hallmark 'character' and aplomb, but was operating in an empathy-free zone and I felt strangely unmoved by his plight. The other actors take a workaday approach to the job, but all those middle-class English accents prattling on froze my brain, and I missed a lot of their lines because I was yawning (my jaw still aches). This movie is unattractive, uninspiring, tedious, annoying, and life-draining.But it did make me feel something: it made me feel depressed about the prospect of getting old, and the growing probability we all have of getting dementia. Having relatives with dementia is bad enough, but watching someone's mind dissolve in front of your eyes for entertainment must be appealing only to people with a sick sense of humour or disturbed morality. Hope I die before I get old. Or at least before I ever have to watch this movie again.",

            "content": "\"The Alzheimer's symptom initiates with slight memory loss and confusion, but then the symptom ultimately leads to severe and irreversible mental impairment\". This is what is written in Wikipedia, and this is what the movie is very well displaying, to let us realize the extreme difficulties of a man (Anthony) approaching the illness, and stimulate our sadness for this fellow old guy. It is very difficult to represent as real as possible the struggle within the mental difficulties, but the movie passes the exam through one of the best performance ever by a unique actor, who has the capability to drive us between the emotions and the compassion, to abruptly but also gently let us feel to be side by side with him, to embrace his confusion, then ending the effort with his last delicate monologue at the end, when the actor goes from serioussness to soft angry, from a bitter smile to a genuine final cry (his tears come from real), he gives up asking for his mom to protect and to fetch him, resigning to his destiny. Excellent Mr. Hopkins.My compliments also to the Director. The watch is the metaphore of the concept of memory, at the beginning Anthony always worried not to find it, then passing time and fading away from his wrist, eventually losing it at the end. We can notice the movie is shot entirely in internal ambients, to stress and underline the closure of the mind, then the last scene ends looking outside the window, the camera even fades through the glass, to breathe the air and feel the green of the trees, in the search for the peace and the hope to be far from the illness, for our friend Anthony, and for ourselves.",

            "content": "The Good: Firstly, the actors. Of course, Anthony Hopkins shows us a master class in acting - but that wouldn't be enough if everyone around him faltered. Thankfully, they don't - with the entire (small) cast performing astonishingly well with gripping, believable and nuanced performances. The directing is also tight and assured (in a directorial debut no less) - in keeping the setting small, the first-time director can play to his strengths - using the same amount of space he would have in a stage play. Using the unreliable narrator trope is also a clever move - as it keeps the story engaging and interesting when there's actually not much going on in the 'timeline'.The Bad: There isn't much to complain about really. It's a small script that doesn't really go anywhere outside the main characters - this is not a criticism, but don't expect a grand tale with sweeping cinematic gestures - this is firmly about a father, daughter and those in close proximity.Should you watch it: This is an intense film with a gripping final scene. If you are OK with the subject matter (my mum can't watch this as my grandfather went through this), then the film will leave you with a lasting impression. Highly recommended.",

However it's emotional struggle as her fathers health continues to deteriorate over the year and doesn't know what's left to do. Touching and heartwarming but rather depressing film. This this is a film that touches on a rather common real world issue that affects so many families it's a story that everyone can get behind even f you don't know anybody personally however it does has a certain impact on those who know somebody or themselves have succumb to Alzheimer. The movie deliverance shows how much of a struggle it is to dealing with, however not just from Ann's perspective but also from Anthony Hopkins whodelivers one of the best performances in his career. Hand down me of his most Memorable rolls fitting to go along side Hannibal Lecter & Pope Benedict It's not a straightforward story the film is all over the place multiple interpretations and different perspectives it does a great job keeping you off track and unaware what's fully going on. Someone's would probably say that that's a problem and it causes the point to where they're confused about what's going on. That's the point You can see that they tried to make you feel more what would be like to be in his position. Where everything is not as clear or an order now things to be misinterpreted or confused. It has more immerse immersion to the audience on that note. There's One scene the movie where Ann returns home but it's indicated to the point that he doesn't even fully recognize his own daughter and she literally looks like an entirely different person to him. Constantly their points were scenes play out but they play out varied. Olivia Colman does a marvelous job you feel her struggle, you want her to do her to try to do wants best what is the course not as simple as one wish it was. They're both in a helpless state each with in a struggle. The Father manages to captivated audience emotionally and keep you invested It was a magnificent performance highly warranted of its acclaim.",

            "review_title": "Stage-to-screen done right",
            "content": "I'm not usually a big fan of movies adapted from stage plays, because the very nature of writing for the theatre places the audience's focus on dialogue, structure and performance, and I'm more of a visuals and music guy when it comes to movies. I can appreciate sharp writing but I need the extra zest of overall fine filmmaking to bring an adaptation above and beyond the theatre. I tend to be more forgiving if a beautiful looking and great sounding movie is relatively lacking in plot or dialogue, versus the opposite (a movie with great writing, but technically bland).I'm a big fan of Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman, but the potentially sensitive subject of dementia, and the fact that this was adapted from a play by a director who was making his screen directorial debut, had me worried. Would it be as stodgy or emotionally manipulative as it could have been? The material might have worked well on stage but would it as cinema?In that regard I was pleasantly surprised. Clearly this was a play, because it is indeed driven by the dialogue and character interactions, and almost entirely set indoors. But Florian Zeller provides some nice cinematic touches that help to raise the experience, mainly in three ways. One, his use of music. The few classical pieces here come in at just the right moments and are extremely effective whenever they do. I suspect that the music was also part of the stage production, because it's important to the protagonist's characterization; listening to music is Anthony's favored escape from reality. But here, the soundtrack fits the movie like a glove and gives it more dynamism. Two, Zeller's cinematographer, Ben Smithard, a veteran of numerous films and shows, vividly captures both the indoor and outdoor environments, most notably the main flat that contains most of the \"action.\" The apartment complex becomes its own character, in a way, as the viewer gets to know its geography and objects. Credit must also go to the production and set designers, of course. Three, and probably most importantly, you have the excellent work by Greek film editor Yorgos Lamprinos. I haven't seen anything else he has done, but his editing here is a huge part of what makes this material translate so well as a movie. He was deservedly nominated for an Oscar.But those are all factors that personally made this such an excellent film for ME. Of course, the main draws here for most people will be Anthony Hopkins and the writing, by an award-winning playwright. And those things are as strong as you've heard. The writing is witty, unpredictable and, by the end, poignant, as you enter the frayed mind of Anthony while he deals with encroaching dementia. Zeller's treatment of such a sensitive subject is refreshingly free of sentimentality or emotional manipulation. This is pitched almost as much like a Hitchcockian mystery as it is a drama of old age and family, and the pacing is fantastic; at a tight 97 minutes, it never overstays its welcome or drags. As is typical of great writing, the script drops only as much detail as it needs to throughout, while leaving just enough lingering questions in the viewers' minds. And beware, not all of those questions will be answered. Even after the end credits begin rolling, you will need to interpret certain plot points in your own way, and there is a lot of fodder for discussion and debate here. My partner and I couldn't agree on what really transpired in the family's past. It frustrated her, but I loved the ambiguity.Hopkins is simply amazing here. He brings humor, anger, sadness, irascibility, strength and fragility in one fully formed and complex package of a character. He's such a natural in the role that I assumed he originated the part on stage. So It was to my surprise that I found out that not only was this film Hopkins's first time playing \"Anthony,\" but the play was originally in French and therefore began life with a French lead in the role. Christopher Hampton, the translator, rightly receives a co-writing credit because he is a large part of why the English dialogue still crackled so well. Anybody would think it was the original language. The immensely talented Olivia Colman holds her own as the titular character's loving yet conflicted daughter, but this is mainly Hopkins's show and he is absolutely engrossing every second he's on the screen. And it's not just his facial expressions and line delivery either; it's a surprisingly physical performance; the viewer can easily gleam Anthony's varying moods and emotions merely from his body language (and he shows off some dance moves too). I haven't yet seen the late Chadwick Boseman in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, but after witnessing Hopkins's incredible work here, I can't imagine anyone else more deserving of the Best Actor Oscar. Mads Mikkelsen for Another Round, maybe, but he somehow wasn't even nominated.",

P. McMurphy, Dustin Hoffman's Rain Man and, of course, Anthony Hopkins's Hanibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs. And with no fear to make an overstatement, I can easily say that an 83 years old Anthony Hopkins did it again.Hopkins's performance is technically perfect, very emotional and powerfull. The result is a character with diferent layers, that is not just a man with a disease, but a man who once was charismatic, intelligent and proud. His struggle to not be able to be that anymore can be noticed on his lost look, his pain and in the solitude that his condition holds him. The intensity of all this fellings is brought to us in a raw way that just a great actor can do.And although Hopkin's performance is the main factor of the movie, it isn't just that what makes The Father a great movie. The editing is a crucial factor to creat confusion and imerse the audience in the main character's perspective. The screenplay is able to make the family drama comprensible as well the fellings of the diferent characters, besides all the confusion we are all imerse. And last, but not least, Olivia's Colman's great performance just makes the movie a more powerfull experience and reminds that this dificult situation can be lived by anyone who has an aged parent.All these makeThe Father a necessary, unconfortable and powerfull experience.",

This is a scenario that is playing out with too many families across the world, which makes it that much more relatable to the masses.The film is pretty stationery from a set perspective, so the emphasis is instead on the dialogue between the cast.

As he tries to make sense of his changing circumstances, he begins to doubt his loved ones, his own mind and even the fabric of his reality.Wow what a beautiful and cleverly constructed film that was very moving. The script was absolutely fantastic, some truly brilliant righting here. The performances were absolutely phenomenal, Olivia Colman was fantastic, but Anthony Hopkins was outstanding. His performance was powerful, moving and authentically told, showing the horrible effects dementia and Alzheimer's has on people, his Oscar was deserved.

The character conflict was great and understandable. The character development and depth was fantastic. Whilst also showing a fantastic balance to conflicting attitudes towards care homes and what's right for the different people involved. It was extremely cleverly constructed, it was like we were watching the film from the perspective of Anthony and jumbled plot represented his declining health, it was exceptionally well done. It also snuck in a bit of humour, the deep themes and emotional weight were very touching and hard to watch in places. The twists were well executed, and the ending was very moving.My only slight little nitpick would be that there was some unlikeable character decisions, but I sort of understood them.So overall, The Father is a cleverly constructed and beautiful film. That tells the story of someones battle with dementia so beautifully, authentically and cleverly, it was amazing to watch. It tackled the emotional themes well, and Olivia and Anthony did fantastic jobs. A must see film.",

I feel Hopkins did an amazing job. But he wasn't alone. Olivia Colman, Olivia Williams and Imogen Poots were amazing supporting actors too.This maybe a touchy film to watch if you have a close family member going through this because it feels so real. I would be really disappointed if Anthony Hopkins does not win the Best Actor award.SOLID 10 OF 10.",

I believe he has done justice to the topic of this film (which I will not spoil if you do not know). Olivia Colman's performance as Anne was also impressive, who like Anthony managed to portray a variety of emotions with hard hitting impact. I must also praise the set design that was subtly adapted to complement the characters ever changing reality. There is no question as to why this film was nominated for 6 Oscars, it's a master piece that demands everyones attention; but approach with caution as this film is heartbreaking to watch.",

His acting level isn't reached by an actor before, every detail, every behavior and involuntary and involuntary reaction that the elderly perform in the role without even noticing that he is acting, but rather actually doing it even intuitively.Of course, there was some incomprehensible scenes and put us in a questionable position, for which we will not find an answer, but this is exactly the point of those scenes.",

I knew that Anthony was sick from the very beginning - that was pretty obvious. But I can't believe that's all there was to it though. No twist. No surprise. No nothing. Obviously not even a happy ending. He's sick. That's the whole story. Goodbye.Every other line is \"What do you mean?\". Not even kidding you. I seriously doubt that whoever wrote this script has ever spent even 5 minutes with someone who has dementia or Alzheimer's. If someone is sick and you know they're sick and they start talking about something that clearly doesn't make sense you don't ask them \"What do you mean\" every 3 seconds and then act surprised that they don't remember what you told them 2 days ago - THEY ARE SICK! HELLO??The director clearly thought \"Maybe if I slow this down to a painfully slow pace they'll think it's a masterpiece!\"10 minutes of this movie was someone doing stuff in the kitchen that had nothing to do with the story.This was first written as a book and then adapted to be a play in a theater where you have just one or two locations and they never bothered to adapt it for film. It all just happens in that one apartment. As soon as I saw in the credits that it was based on a book I knew I'd be wasting my time.

The plot feels disoriented but it's a purposeful disorientation as you realize that's what these patients feel. Names, faces, and memories all become jumbled. Alzheimer's patients do not experience time in the same linear concept that we do, and this movie captures that so perfectly. Sir Anthony Hopkins does a masterful job of bringing us into the mind of Anthony, an elderly gentleman suffering from Dementia, and Olivia Coleman captures the emotions and trials that her character, Anne, must endure as Anthony's daughter and caregiver. I hope that every medical professional sees this in order to help us provide better care for our patients, and I hope this brings a greater understanding to the public about those suffering from this illness, leading to more acceptance and a kinder world for us all. This movie is a must watch as it will keep you in your seat, and keep you guessing every step of the way. I'd also like to take a moment to explain that while not every person with Dementia may be this way, a large part are. There are different versions of Dementia, with some patients not gaining lucidity the way Anthony does, and some patients being completely pleasant in manner and mood. However, all the characteristics of the illness portrayed in this film are accurate, are not dramatized, and unfortunately are very real for millions across the globe.

The realistic Father of Delusional Mind-shakers like Persona, Fight Club and Shutter Island. The Father is not that emotional soaking experience as we assume from the title and genre, rather it is damn confusing at the beginning and extremely delusional based on the realistic term called Memory Loss or Old-age solitude issues. Don't know why but somehow it reminded of Classic films made on delusional effects like Bergman's Persona (1966), Fincher's Fight Club (1998) and Scorsese's Shutter Island (2010) etc. But The Father is far more realistic than those fictional thrillers. The film is about a man who refuses all assistance from his daughter as he ages. As he tries to make sense of his changing circumstances, he begins to doubt his loved ones, his own mind and even the fabric of his reality. By the end it gets over-confusing but fortunately provides all the answers in classy and artistic cinematic sequences. With the small runtime of 97 minutes it never bores you, it feels less actually. I was like, show me some more this is too short. Anyways, whatever they put on screen is simply brilliant and connectable despite the intricate theories used to explore a normal issue. I doubt, some people may not even understand it in the first watch and they shall have to watch again to understand it better. Anthony Hopkins gives a performance to remember and i would like to see him winning couple of honorary awards this year. The supporting cast is fine too. The Father is all about Zeller's outstanding vision to look at an ordinary routine and then showing it in extraordinary manners. How smartly he shuffles his characters, the sequences, linear equation and timeline of events is just splendid. Overall, The Father is A Must Watch and perhaps the Best Film of 2020.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",

Early signs of dementia and Anthony sitting alone in his chair with vivid memories of his two daughters , Anne who is alive and Lucy who died years back are depicted very well. Coming in and out of past into the present oblivious to who is around him, Anthony interacts with guests in his usual charming manner. Anne as a patient and caring daughter who shares with her dad the unhappiness of losing her only sibling is authentic. Anne listens to her father talking proudly about artistic talents of Lucy who is long gone but father makes it sound like Lucy is alive . Screenplay by Florian Zeller and Christopher Hampton is excellent. Antony Hopkins as the father is great. Loved the scenes when Anthony is trying to get up from his chair, scenes where he patiently tries again and again to slide his arms into sleeve of sweater while Anne watches father struggle with simple acts taken for granted , scene while driving Anne gently puts her hand on dad's hand and he avoids the touch. Olivia Colman is extremely talented and was adored in the movie The favourite . Anthony Hopkins , great in movies like Silence of the Lambs and The Two Popes , is definitely perfect as The father. Oscar worthy Direction, screenplay, editing. Oscar worthy acting by Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman. My first movie on the big screen after 365 days.97minutes of best emotional display.",

            "review_title": "One of the most heartbreaking depictions of a debilitating illness I have ever seen on screen",
            "content": "\"The Father\" is a drama film directed and co-written by Florian Zeller, based on his stage play of the same name. Starring Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman, it is one of the most heartbreaking depictions of a debilitating illness I have ever seen on screen.In London, the elderly Anthony (Anthony Hopkins) lives alone in his flat as he struggles to cope with his crippling dementia affecting both his short and long term memory. Anthony's daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) offers to help him through various means, from sending him live-in nurses to placing him in a retirement home, but he stubbornly refuses all assistance. As his condition worsens, Anthony starts to realise he is now unable to distinguish between events that happened minutes ago with ones that happened days, months, and even years ago. This causes him to become distrustful of his family and puts a huge strain on his relationship with everyone around him.It is a sad reality that the older we get, the more vulnerable we are to the degradation of our mental wellbeing. From personal experience, I have watched as my 98-year-old grandma deals with frequent memory loss and severe hearing difficulties whenever it is my family's time to look after her. What a film like \"The Father\" does so brilliantly is invite the audience to adopt the perspective of similar elderly individuals, showing us that their problems are way more serious than we may have been initially aware. We see as poor Anthony tries to make sense of simple tasks like remembering what location he placed his wristwatch in his flat, even though it is established by his daughter that he always places it underneath the bathtub. Something like that may seem trivial to us, but to him it is a key factor in identifying the rate at which his mind is deteriorating. Another thing worth mentioning is that he is also unable to recall what people look like, mentally superimposing other's faces onto the bodies of his loved ones. Scenes like this particularly stuck out to me as it reminded me of how annoyed my grandma must feel as she is beginning to forget things like which of her great-grandchildren was given an award at school. These are just some of the many difficulties that senior citizens around the world must face that this film shows in such a heart-wrenching manner.Being based on a play, the film makes use of a minimalistic setting, with the action taking place primarily inside either Anthony's flat or Anne's house. Director Florian Zeller uses some inventive cinematography here to depict how closed in and empty Anthony's world is as his dementia gets worse over time. Zeller also utilises subtle visual metaphors such as the brooding muted colours of wall tiles and choices in clothing to convey how Anthony's declining mental state is taking its toll on not only himself, but his own family. It is made very clear that Anne is suffering greatly as well, caring for her father through his ever-growing outbursts of frustration, which is a true test of her patience. Again, I must compare something like this to how my grandma is handling her own issues in her advanced age. It makes me reflect on all the situations where I may have been tempted to dismiss her complaints as typical old people's problems that I don't have to worry about, however, this film opened my eyes to the fact that this is something that can and will affect us all one day and that we should all try to exercise a little empathy from time to time.As one should expect by now, Anthony Hopkins gives an outstanding performance as the main character who shares his first name (so named by the director as he was the only actor he envisioned for this role). Even well into his eighties, Hopkins shows no sign that he is losing his ability to blow us away with his realistic approach to acting, giving his character a tragic sense of pathos we can immediately sympathise with. It is worth noting that Hopkins is apparently known for his uncanny ability to memorise entire scripts back to front, so this makes it even more impressive that he is able to play someone whose memory is in such a terrible state so perfectly. Olivia Colman was also great as Anne, who tries hard to deal with her father as his condition continues to diminish. Anybody who has dealt with the pain of an elderly loved one going through such problematic illnesses will find much to identify with in her character, as she wants his constant suffering to end just as much as he does.Although it is easy for films nowadays to touch on topics like dementia/Alzheimer's for the sake of cheap entertainment, this one truly feels like they've done a respectable job at doing so, especially since it doesn't sugarcoat its themes the way most others would. There's so much to appreciate in the sense of realism it presents in the long lasting emotional impact these illnesses can leave on families. Very few films have moved me to the brink of tears but I believe this one deservedly holds such a rare distinction. If you are still in contact with any elderly relatives, I implore you to reach out to them before they are gone forever and take the time to ensure they feel loved.I rate it a solid 9/10.",

People come, people go--his former helper, his new helper, his daughter, his son-in-law--but we are never quite sure who is real and who is not, because some of them exist only in his imagination. It is precisely this confusion, on his part and ours, that is at the core of this heartbreaking film. As the title character, Anthony Hopkins is better than ever, losing little bits of himself (and large chunks of his memory) as he withers away before our eyes, turning in a performance that is as fully realized and richly detailed as any you will see this year. (If by the end of the film you still aren't weeping, you'd better have your tear ducts checked.) The splendid Olivia Colman is every bit as moving as his daughter, who desperately wants to do what's best for her dad but is not at all sure how to go about it. The lighting--generally subdued, and often downright dim--serves as a perfect metaphor for the darkness in his mind, and the long, long night that lies ahead. Flawlessly directed by Florian Zeller, who co-wrote the screenplay with Christopher Hampton. A Tony-winner in 2016 for Frank Langella, who starred in the stage version, also written by Zeller.

If there exists a true unbiased and fair award for acting excellence this year Sir Anthony Hopkins should win his 2nd Best Actor Oscar. His performance as Anthony an elderly man and the father of Anne who in another perfect role is played by Olivia Coleman is beyond superb. This is a Masterclass in cinema acting by both Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Coleman. Some might say Anthony Hopkins who is 83 years old is just playing a man his own age . To the contrary it takes incredibly fine acting and precise timing to play a man with rapidly advancing dementia convincingly. It could only be played by an Actor of experience and deep sensitivity. This is the finest portrait of dementia as far as I'm concerned since Dame Judi Dench played Iris Murdoch in 2001 . Dame Judi who was also nominated as Best Actress in\n2002 lost to Halle Berry for Monsters Ball. I feel a similar result will occur this year judging by predictions this so far . The far superior performance of Anthony Hopkins will probably lose out to a sentimental vote for a far lesser performance by Chadwick Boseman who tragically died last year. Sir Anthony Hopkins was the only choice for Director and author of the play Florian Zeller . He wanted Anthony Hopkins specifically for the part. He sent Hopkins the script in 2017 and waited for a reply. In the meantime, he did not pursue production with any other actors in the lead role. He said if Hopkins had not agreed to the film, then it likely would have been made in French instead. Christopher Hampton who wrote the screenplays for Atonement ( 2007) and Dangerous Liaisons 1998 (which he won an Oscar for his screenplay) and The Quiet American 2002 co wrote the Screenplay for The Father with Florian Zeller and both have deservedly been recognised by their nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay for 2021. I don't rate films on feel good value or entertainment enjoyment alone in fact as an elderly man over 70 years of age this movie is more than a little disturbing and confronting but it's cinematic excellence and performances make it one f the great films of 2021 and if you love the craft of acting it's a must see. In all Academy Award nominated performances I look for the moment you say yes! That's an Oscar moment in The Father I counted at least 3 Oscar winning moments for the brilliance of Sir Anthony Hopkins this may be his last Oscar nominated role of his long life I hope not but I'm also hoping that he wins this year's Academy Award for Best Actor.",

            "content": "I can't believe I just awarded one star to a film with substantial roles for Olivia Colman and Rufus Sewell, two of my favourite actors.Hopkins just drags it down ... and down ... to the point where it become totally predictable and utterly unwatchable.Hopkins is, in my opinion, an insanely overrated actor. He had his best moment 30 years ago in \"The Silence of the Lambs\" and never quite showed anything new since then. In fact, it seems as if he has regressed to his pre-Lechter mediocrity. His last turn, in \"The Two Popes,\" was another totally forgettable appearance.The writing for his character offers him no chance to break-out of an endless loop of confusing daughters, chickens, husbands, and that damned, perpetually-missing wristwatch.Would he have received an Oscar nomination in a non-pandemic year when the release of fresh films had not been so drastically truncated?There is some solace that Academy Award for Best Actor will most certainly go to the well-deserving Chadwick Boseman, a great talent taken from us all too soon.Hopefully this will be the last we see of 83-year-old Hopkins. Even Laurence Olivier, an actor with a far, far greater range, had the good sense to retire, returning to the screen for a final three-minute cameo appearance in the year of his death at age 82 in the non-speaking role of a wheelchair-bound World War I soldier (his voice, reciting a poem, is overdubbed).The director is to be faulted as well. Just as with \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,\" \"Father\" began its life as a stage-play set mostly in one room, to be performed for live audiences of about 1.000. In both cases, nothing was done to open up the story, and they do not meet the criteria of film: they are but documents of stage dramas, complete with five-minute monologues which would work well onstage, but not in film. But if I need to hear someone rant for five minutes, I'd much rather it be Viola Davis.",

            "content": "I had a bad feeling about it when it started with Opera...You know these kinds of jokes that rely on redundancy: \"Dental plan\" \"Lisa needs braces\" or the long introduction of the vessel in \"Spaceballs\", it's funny because it challenges our patience, then it stops being funny when it gets on our nerves and then it takes that extra level of length that gets it back to funny... I'm not sure this work for drama.Take a premise that could work for a 30-minute TV theatre film, but multiply the scenes that say exactly the same thing and cast an acclaimed aging actor like Sir Anthony Hopkins, and apparently, you get a masterpiece.Now, I just saw \"The Father\", the highly-acclaimed and universally praised film about a man estranged to his daughter, in fact the whole world around him and hopelessly battling the inexorable descent into dementia. It so happens that I saw it with my own father, we thought this was going to be one of these poignant family dramas with two persons coming to terms at the end, for the obligatory deathbed scene, not the peak of originality but with an actor of Hopkins' caliber, watching him waiting to catch a stout for two hours can be a sight to watch.I wish the film was about fishing.I like a film to subvert my expectations, to come with something new, and Anthony Hopkins gives a great performance, a magnificent one, an Oscar-worthy one and what do you know, he won it. Haing said that, the choice of portraying a dementia form the POV of the patient is interesting and revolutionary but for a play. I admire the daringness and guts of Florian Zeller to challenge and disorient spectators by putting on stage scenes that are the figments of a man's imagination.Now, every review raves about that challenging idea and the way it allow us to feel the confusion of the poor man and being as disoriented and dizzy as he is... I agree that it's a great way to build empathy but I don't think this is the ultimate way to put ourselves in an old person's shoes or feel the ordeal of senility or Alzheimer, let alone, feel the emotional burden of the children. Since we never know who is real and who is not, it kind of defeats the purpose of empathy.For me that's how the film lost me, when it played hard to get for the third time, it was one to me and I guess my mind was so unwilling to pursue the effort that I told my effort there was no need to go on, I know his tastes, he needs linear and straight narratives. A film can be original if there's something entertaining to sustain it but I can't see how wrapping confusion with pathos can make for a pleasant experience. If you're going to hit the sensitive chords, maybe you shouldn't make it too cerebral. A good thing there are occasional burst of humor and lightheartedness, this film at times is literally the Anthony Hopkins' show.Now, don't get the wrong idea about my Dad, the day before, we were watching \"The Hunt\", one film made us talk and comment and anticipate actions. With \"The Father\", after the first scene, we remained silent and I know what that silence meant, we hoped that something better would come up after. It didn't. After the first scene with Anne (Olivia Colman) the daughter, comes the one with the man played by Mark Gatiss who's supposedly married with a woman played by Olivia Williams who also plays the nurse at the end. Then you have Anne's husband played by Rufus Sewell and Imogen Poots who plays the new carer but by the time we got to the slapping scene, I could feel my Dad's agony and told me that I had just read about the film, and it wouldn't get any better.I finished the film. I tried to appreciate the performance of Hopkins and his poignant interactions with Colman (who was nominated too). I consider the scene with Poots as one of Hopkin's career's highlights especially the mood swing that terminate the smile that kept illuminating her face. But for one moments like this, we have to endure these long walk over dark corridors, these moments of sheer melancholy, this Opera music and these damn violins. Watching them and even knowing that Zeller is a respectable playwright, I was wondering why he had to exploit that stylistic choice till the end. I know it didn't prevent the film from garnering 98% of approval on Rotten Tomatoes and get on IMDb Top 250, some Youtube videos from people who've seen it more than once provide explanations.Well, I saw the film twice and I listened to the explanation. And for me it all comes down to one question: why the mystery since we already know the answer? Why not get to the heart of the matter, which is a matter of the heart? And that's what the final scene is about, a breakdown, something deep and sincere, without any trick or artistic license. I'm at least grateful for Zeller to have made the scene that way.As for the rest, I think people were so blinded by Anthony Hopkins' performance, that they praised the performance rather than the whole film or they were so admirative of the change of perspective that they felt like rewarding its \"courage\". I have an idea, next time I will shoot a movie entirely in black and black, total darkness and I will say it's a way to make you feel empathetic to the ordeal of blind people. Maybe it would work.Speaking for myself, and I know I'm in a minority, \"The Father\" made it for a depressing, bleak and confusing experience. It was a drag. And even the musical choices were atrocious. I stop here, I don't want to get redundant, myself.",

            "content": "\"The Father\" blew me away! Anthony Hopkins is getting all manner of accolades for his performance and deservedly so, but Olivia Colman is brilliant too.The film plays out from the point of view of the man with Alzheimer's. Consequently, the storyline is hallucinatory, disjointed, confusing, filled with internal contradictions, and makes dizzying leaps in time. All that works to the movie's advantage as it shows us how that loathsome disease will turn a once-vital man into a desiccated husk of his former self.Having witnessed the ravages of Alzheimer's as it destroyed two people I loved, I found a lot to relate to in \"The Father.\" One example is the fantasy segment in which Ann imagines herself choking the life out of the old man. She has these thoughts not out of malice or resentment, but because she wishes to end her father's suffering, as well as her own.One issue the film does not address is finances. The characters are well off enough that when Ann makes the heartbreaking decision to put her father in a nursing home, he gets a private room in a comfortable-looking facility with a nurse who gives him one-on-one attention.Having once held a driving job for a pharmacy, I delivered to a lot of nursing homes. Many of them stank of urine and feces, crammed several patients into a room, and were severely understaffed so that one-on-one care was impossible. I would be interested in someday seeing a film about Alzheimer's in which the victim and his loved ones are working-class or poor.Having seen only a handful of movies from the Year of Covid, I can't say for sure that \"The Father\" is the best film of 2020. It is, however, the best one I've seen. This is nothing to watch if you're looking for escapist entertainment; but if you want a film for the ages, you've found it.",

            "content": "Moving from non-diegetic sound to diegetic sound of classical music the dementia-afflicted titular father is listening to while relaxing, we right away found ourselves slipping into his mind and, subsequently, descending into his deteriorating mental state. Thus, we're instantly warned that what we're going to witness of events are, by and large, untrustworthy. Adopting such narrative technique isn't the easiest to pull off, never mind when applied to a character-driven story about a man doubting \"the fabric of his reality.\" For in case it failed, the story would be in total shambles (Capone is a case in point, assuming that was its intent in the first place); and if it paid off, the story would offer us a sympathetic look at its main character. Florian Zeller managed to do the near-impossible, generating empathy towards a character we're not suffering from what it suffers by tapping on the truth we relentlessly evade each time we see our grandparents, for instance, fail to recall words, our names or even to recognise who we are while they're doing their utmost to convince us otherwise. This film embraces this fear to a disturbingly horrifying degree. We found ourselves pondering over what we see as an impending condition so much so we're simultaneously letting the uneasiness dominates our thoughts while we're sitting watching the movie.Zeller also managed here to give The Father a clinical quality reminiscent of psychological horror films to keep us always on the verge of being painfully unsettled at any time. High pitched sharp sounds and disquietingly cozy furniture(s) are here to accentuate this feeling so that a little boundary-pushing moment would send a shiver down the spine along with some suppressed tears begging to be shed. And then we have Hopkins delivering a tour de force performance that will soon or later be regarded as one of his best. Through his character, we see him in an utter bewilderment, incessantly trying to figure out what's happening around him and make sense of all that \"nonsense\" in such manner that force you to do so along with him. That's the definition of an engaging performance. Another thing I noticed through his facial expressions is the that he seems to be constantly processing his surroundings as well as every words he hears. A truly brilliant performance that dictates how similar characters should be played. I'm really hoping Riz Ahmed wins since it would be his first Oscar but, truth be told, Sir Hopkins is more worthy of it. Olivia Colman is absolutely amazing as always, but it's Imogen Poots as the nurse (Laura) that caught me off guard with the scenes she shares with Anthony. The spontaneity of elderly people that can be inadvertently offensive and their fear of being mocked at or at least of being treated rather as children collide here in way that made me continuously switch back and forth between sympathising towards each of them. This is a unique, unprecedented cinematic achievement, and definitely my favourite movie of 2020.(10/10)~Spoiler Alert~A spoiler warning here as I'm talking about a certain motif in this movie, that is the \"watch\". Besides the \"apples\" in Pieces of a Woman, this is yet another deft use of motifs in movies from the last year. The watch here indicates Anthony's grasp of the sense of time and age. His watch is first mentioned as being snatched by Laura. Later on, we see Anthony suspects Paul to be wearing his watch. In both occasions, it was the first time for him to be introduced to these characters, and the fact he failed to recognise them made them sources of intimidation that threaten his supposed control over his memory. In the soul-crushing ending scene where he's with his nurse, Catherine, he says that he wants his mom but his nurse corrects him, saying he means his daughter. However, he insists that it's his mom, then he mentions that he wants her and that he's losing his leaves. Then, in a last desperate attempt to convince himself of his sanity, he says that he knows that his watch is on his wrist. From all this we may gather that his last monologue seems to sum up all his life, and his aging to be precise. His life went in full circle and now he's a child again in a pressing need of his mom.",

As a nurse who had worked in nursing home for sometime in the past, I can confirm it's quite a popular case in Europe, and it has also been going on for quite a long time. So since this drama wanted to be many things else, with sci-fi and mystery are among those, it forgot to actually present anything special to the situation, and became not so much worth paying attention to. It looks more like a backstory episode in a TV series than a movie, and the fact that it also leads to the inevitable, to the norm, it makes itself quite unimportant. I have to say I can hardly understand all the praise for this movie. Anthony Hopskins is amazing in it but as the story repeats a common reality, his performance gets old quickly. The only saving grace for it is probably the vibrant and excellent choices of opera soundtrack, but even with that, I was struggling quite much to finish this movie.",

They chose several clever and comprehensive ways to make us feel, confused, unsettled, uncomfortable, upset and mostly all at the same time. It was an emotional rollercoaster for anyone who has had a loved one in this predicament.Just when we thought the \"watch\" was an anchor, then the \"chicken\" was an anchor, or even a blue top, it was ripped away by cutting time, changing furniture or even changing characters faces.The bigger question must be did these theatrical tricks achieve their goal and work their magic. I think on reflection the answer must be a solid yes, by proxy we felt totally befuddled throughout.With regard to the acting, it was a tour-de-force performance from Anthony Hopkins, totally stellar in its micro-gestures, the plastic bag in the pocket, or the furtive glance at a watch. This was an obvious Oscar winner in a year when there was nothing else to challenge, however that observation does not diminish this achievement.Olivia Colman really turned it out and I would say her performance here was much better than the blank expression of Francis McDormand in Nomadland, but what do I know!This was a miserable, tedious and worthy movie that I endured and experienced, I admired its scope and delivery but I never want to see it again, never ever, and I do not suggest anyone else sees it for the first time, as it would just not be possible to enjoy this movie on any level.I give this a solid 8 out of 10 meaning its good and you should watch it, but if something is showing in the next screen go and see that instead.",

            "content": "I didn't expect to write this review but after hearing so many good things about it and then watching it, The Father blew my expectations and moved me with all kinds of emotions. From Anthony Hopkins' acting (which he won an Oscar for) to the person behind the film and play it's based on. Florian Zeller co-wrote The Father alongside fellow playwright Christopher Hampton and based it on Zeller's 2012 play. It was also his directorial debut. Florian Zeller created a film so moving, so brilliant, he created a masterpiece in the drama genre. Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman in the leads. Whilst the supporting cast has Rufus Sewell, Imogen Poots, Olivia Williams and Mark Gatiss.A man refuses all assistance from his daughter as he ages. As he tries to make sense of his changing circumstances, he begins to doubt his loved ones, his own mind and even the fabric of his reality.I would call The Father a psychological drama because of how we're seeing Anthony Hopkins' character's condition worsening for each scene. Normally, films based on plays that are dialogue heavy is something I wouldn't normally recommend, The Father is dialogue heavy but it's Hopkins' performance and the important story Zeller is telling that makes it so interesting, that you can't stop watching. Though a brilliant film, with me having a fear of getting dementia and someone close to me who had dementia, I wouldn't say it was an easy watch. But it's a film everyone should see before they die, if not for the story, for Anthony Hopkins acting performance as it might possibly be his best. Many critics call it his best performance, I don't agree with it being his best, but certainly one of his best. Olivia Colman brings a terrific performance as the Daughter, a character many will be familiar with, I was. Zeller and Hampton won Best Adapted Screenplay at the Academy Awards and the film received six nominations in total, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress (Olivia Colman).Will I ever watch The Father again? The hard truth is, I don't know, probably not. But I'm so grateful for having the opportunity to watch it, to experience Florian Zelle's work. Zelle wrote the part especially for Anthony Hopkins and I'm glad he accepted the role, it won him many awards but most importantly the importance of the performance regarding dementia in general.",

            "content": "It's set in the late 2010s in London, England, and captures part of an 80-year-old man's journey with increasing dementia.Anne (Olivia Colman) has come to the end of the line with her father, Anthony (Anthony Hopkins), who has just caused his last caretaker to quit because he accused her of stealing his watch. Anne, who is divorced, tells Anthony she has met a man and will be moving to Paris. However, she will try once more with another caregiver before putting him in a nursing home.The bulk of the film is primarily flashes of Anthony's changing memories and moods. It is not clear what is reality and what is not. It's not clear where he is living until the end of the film. Did Anne actually have a husband, Paul (Rufus Sewell)? If so, which man is the husband? Sometimes even Anne is a stranger.This is an unsettling film to watch, especially if you're 75 years old! Anthony Hopkins won an Academy Award for his performance, and it was outstanding. Olivia Colman is also excellent. The other characters are a bit slippery since we don't really know what reality they emerge from.My biggest problem with the film is that most characters do not respond appropriately to dementia. But does that matter, since Anthony denies dementia's reality, and it's his film.",

It has strong or deep feelings of empathy, hope, love, sympathy, sadness, and understanding. Reminds me of old people from personal life and of their problems, and reminds me of personal problems and experiences with various hospitals, psych wards, institutions, mental disorders. Also this could be movie about old people, or any disease, or mental disorders like psychosis or other diseases. Also it is anomalous, meaning very mysterious, where it is so difficult to figure out what is real, what is dream. Reminds me of other problems where such difference is observed like when somebody performs some crime or lies. Also in beginning this looked like big setup and fake, but later it became more realistic, deep, and touching. It increased my empathy, understanding for old and sick people, and even myself. Also it reminds me of some girls, their behaviors, and relationship issues. That bit of nature seen through window reminds me of nature seen in real life through window, of hospitals and other institutions, where sometimes one tree or bush tells whole story about one place, or increases our feelings, because they are somehow common to all people regardless of in which interior people are, their exterior somehow connects them, gives them common same picture, and I feel empathy in that. Difficult to explain, but this movie is more personal, subjective, and emotional. Also because anomalous it is similar to movie Old (2021). And because it is emotional it is similar to some cartoon movies or half cartoon half real movies, or at least emotions are similar, like Balto (1995). There is so much feelings and associations there, some of things being family, abandonment, institutions, disease, love or intimacy or relationship issues, hope, deceased people...just difficult to explain, so emotional. But that seemingly negative feeling of sadness is actually positive here, it inspired or motivated me to improve my life in various areas, on both material and spiritual levels.",

            "content": "THE FATHER is one of those types of films that, generally, I would not seek out - except at Oscar time. A small, \"drawing room\" type of drama, based on a stage play and starring a couple of Oscar winning performers at it's core.And that is enough to make this film very entertaining and interesting...but, unfortunately...this piece of entertainment falls flat at the end, so one will have to be contented to watching a decent drawing room drama (based on a Stage play) starring 2 strong Oscar winning actors at it's core.Written and Directed by Florian Zeller, THE FATHER tells the tale of a...well...FATHER, who is aging and mentally deteriorating. His daughter is trying to aide him and bring him comfort, but his befuddled mind begins to see things (conspiracies) that are not there...or are they?Zeller wrote the lead role, specifically for Anthony Hopkins and it is a very good thing that Hopkins agree to this role for he is in EVERY scene and commands this picture as only a performer of Hopkins stature and abilities can. Hopkins is, rightfully, nominated for this performance and could pull the upset (but I highly doubt it).Strongly supporting him - in an Oscar nominated turn herself - as Olivia Colman as his daughter. She has the much less flashy - but no less important - role in this drama and Hopkins would not be as good as he is without her to play against.Zeller (who was nominated for an Oscar for his Screenplay adaptation of his Stage Play) was smart to cast a strong ensemble of British Stage Actors for this film - Mark Gattis, Olivia Williams, Rufus Sewell and Imogen Poots are all strong, interesting people to watch on screen and they help bring an air of seriousness and gravitas to the proceedings.The first half of this film is extremely fascinating to watch and I was intrigued by the premise, the direction, the script and the direction it seemed to be headed. But...unfortunately (at least for me) the 2nd half of the film (and I would imagine, the Stage Play) never, really capitalizes on the promise of the first half and THE FATHER just sorts of peters out in the end.Which, I guess, you could say for the poor souls who suffer from dementia, but I don't think that was the point that Zeller was trying to make.Letter Grade: A- (did I mention that I really, really liked the first half)8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

            "content": "An award-winning play is being made for the big screen - and by its director, who had no previous film experience. Can that work? Florian Zeller proves that it can. Dementia-stricken and proud Anthony learns from his daughter Anne that she will soon be moving to Paris. From then on, Zeller narrates the successive decline of Anthony's mind in complex but highly emotional and, above all, human ways.Anthony Hopkins is ideally cast for the lead role of Anthony. On the one hand, he is an empathetic father who means well for his daughter, but on the other, his pride and one-dimensionality make him sullen and critical of her decisions. Hopkins has never been seen in this simplicity. His character does not want to accept that his illness is getting the upper hand and is sure that he can manage without the help of care. At the same time, the increasing memory loss is told exclusively from his point of view, which automatically leads you to sympathise with the protagonist despite his often impossible deeds. This sympathy factor that Hopkins permanently carries with him makes it much easier to relate to him. It is arguably his best performance since his legendary one as Dr Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, albeit much more nuanced and realistic. While the strong female role at his side then was Jodie Foster, this time it is Olivia Colman as Anthony's daughter Anne. She logically disagrees with her father and does everything possible to organise the help he needs before she leaves for Paris. Colman is the heart of the film. She is heartbreaking in this role and often cannot emotionally withstand the pain that the sight of her suffering father causes her. Her chemistry with Hopkins is also very deep and often one would think that the two actually share this kind of father-daughter relationship. Colman is fragile in her individual scenes, but also forcefully strong and always torn about her father's treatment. Rounding out the great cast are Imogen Poots, Rufus Sewell and Olivia Williams, all constantly taking on different roles due to the confusion in Anthony's head. Williams in particular adds an enormous amount of vulnerability to her few moments, especially the final scene.Zeller has succeeded in a very particular kind of filmmaking with The Father. In its simplicity, the film is nevertheless very complexly constructed, especially in the first hour, and one cannot believe that dementia can apparently really trigger this process in a person's head. Because Hopkins does such a fantastic job of translating this and the editing also relies very effectively on surprise and suddenness, it never becomes too much to bear. Zeller also manages not to make the film seem exclusively sad, but also enriches the plot with thoroughly funny interludes. Basically, however, The Father is a sentimental drama that continuously makes hearts beat faster and that you can hardly get through without shedding a tear. An instructive, authentic and fascinating piece of filmmaking that is an absolute hit for a directorial debut and should be seen by everyone despite the vehemence of its subject matter.",

The box of film-making and writing tricks that director Florian Zeller (adapting, with Christopher Hampton, his own play) employs is subtle but not so subtle you can't see it. I realised early on that the colour blue would be significant, but the gradual reveal of how and why was harder to predict and expertly unveiled. It's no news that Olivia Colman is brilliant; Anthony Hopkins has been widely praised for this performance, and whilst he didn't blow me away, it's certainly less awards-baiting than I expected. I've heard doctors say that Alzheimer's isn't, after the earlier stages, too distressing for the person suffering; I've always wondered about that, and the film seems a little sceptical too, with the way it puts us in the shoes of the sufferer giving a distressing insight into a disease which is cruel and heart-breaking for all concerned. I hope that people haven't found the film too bleak; that its resonance didn't simply disturb but also offers a measure of healing. That's harder to tell, but it's hard to doubt the film's skill and power.",

            "content": "Based on comments (and awards) most people were mostly taken by Hopkins performance in this film. It was apt, i think, he does well. But really what's fine about this film lies elsewhere.Telling a story is, i suppose, a matter of framing a subject. The \"what\" are you looking at matters not as much as the \"who\" is looking and, specially \"from where\". Literature used to explore these paths, but eventually gave way for cinema. Books evolved to a stance of essay and pure thought, but have been abandoning its narrative drive. Cinema picked up on it, and for the moment is still the medium where narratives are experimented (series are, for the moment, mere illustrations of story facts, in the Griffith tradition).So here we have a story of a man in his late moments. He tells the story, apart from a few establishing shots, no action happens outside Hopkins' scope. He is the one we follow, he is our narrator. But he is senil, and what he sees, or remembers, or says, cannot be trusted, not by us, and even less by him. What is true (if anything) and what is not? Here we enter a fantastic, well plowed field of cinematic narrative (and detective fiction) that has to do with the unreliability of what is being told: Rashomon, Roger Ackroyd, Memento... this is not the \"look at the drama of the old person in pain\", but \"how can i live in this world if i can't trust anything\".The cinematic tricks here are extremely simple (never abandon Hopkins' stance) and incredibly powerful. What takes away from this are two things:-most of the production seems to have been made around the intent to make Hopkins shine (i imagine that may have been one of his conditions to get on board), so much is focused on his character's suffering, and not on the ambiguity of the narrative-closed spaces (flats, prisions, boats) are a cinematic mine. See what Polansky or Hitchcock did with it in terms of making space into a character, making space tell the story. None of that is here... the sets are lush and fine, i suppose, but they never loose the smell of a set. Filming architecture meaningfully remains one of the most challenging subjects in film.",

While I appreciate the unusual viewpoint and the attempt to convey the experience of the person with dementia, it is a very partial view at best.Having lived with dementia in my own family as well as working with dementia patients professionally, this view is incredibly distorted. Most people who have actually cared for someone with dementia would not characterize it so darkly. There are beautiful, loving, and yes, many funny moments. Dementia is always changing with varying degrees of lucidity--which was not shown in the film. And while there may be despairing moments, dementia patients often feel quite jolly. In other words, they have a full range of feelings just like anyone.But what really stung about this movie was the insensitivity and selfishness of everyone around him. Neither the daughter nor her boy friend had the slightest clue how to respond to someone with memory loss. Their insensitivity was painful. The carer was more on target, and the nurse at the end finally came through in a loving manner.If the intent was an empathic portrayal of dementia, the result falls far short. The scenes where he was a bit jolly fell kind of flat against all the despair and darkness.Dementia, which is a progressive malady, is increasingly and incredibly difficult. And yet, everyone I know, myself included, who has stuck it out with a loved one considers it one of the most rewarding experiences of their lives. Even if it does become necessary to put someone in a facility, it is so important for the loving family caregiver role to continue.This movie could have been so much better if it had been better researched and consulted on by people with actual experience.",

After all, not only he suffers, but also his close people.Starring Anthony Hopkins, actually because of him I chose to watch this movie. An incomparable brilliant game paired with an unknown akrissa Olivia made me feel to the full this heaviness and pain, repeated from day to day, the burden of responsibility to my father and the inability to change anything. Throughout the film and the dialogues built between them, you can feel her condescending, but at the same time, reverent attitude, care and love. Is it love? After all, sometimes she wants to kill him. And we see how difficult it is for her to endure these everyday lapses in memory and to ensure a comfortable life for the old man and to establish at least some of her personal life. Unfortunately, all her energy is focused on worrying about taking care of her father and she acts for the sake of her interests and her personal life. Until a certain time.The picture did not impress, but at least made me think about the difficulties that await everyone in old age. About the environment. And about many other things...The actors' acting is brilliant. I watched the movie in one go!",

Interestingly, the lead role was written exclusively for Anthony Hopkins because the main character and he have the same name and even share the same birthday. Hopkins is the soul and heart of this film as everything revolves around it. He goes through several different phases and moods, and he delivered everything neatly and we got one of the best male roles last year, but also in the entire career of the great Sir Anthony Hopkins, which says a lot about the quality. The supporting roles are at a high level because everyone does their part the way they should or the way the film demands, for the purpose of the action and the role. A movie that holds your attention all the time and is by no means a feel good movie or a movie to relax. I hope it finds his audience and gets some award because this movie deserves it.",

The script doesn't sweeten anything. The dialog acts a message of ultimate understanding. In the Kammerspiele style, Anthony Hopkins demonstrates once again to be one of the greatest among actors. The crowd prefers it generally like Lecter, Richard Nixon or Titus Andronicus. I prefer him as C. S. Lewis and the steward of The Remains of the Day. This movie doesn't hide how dementia makes someone unrecognizable to their loved ones. It does trigger a storytelling trick (by the way, as its origin is a thetarical play, I imagine how it'd have been to frequently exchange same-role-performers on stage).",

            "review_title": "The father. Old person simulator. 80%",
            "content": "It occurred to me to watch this film after hearing a review of it on Nightlife (ABC Local radio, Australia, 06/04/2021). The regular film reviewer, Alexandra Heller-Nicholas, mentioned how it put you into the circumstances of the main character, an elderly man who is losing his mental proficiency. That aspect intrigued me, so I thought that I would see it and this cinematic technique prompts my headline of it being an 'old person simulator'.Anthony Hopkins heads a strong cast as the elderly father of the title, Antony (that's how the cast pronounce the name). He is fiercely independent and resists the attempts of his daughter, Anne (played by Olivia Colman), to have someone look after him at his flat. Hopkins is so believable in his portrayal of a man in those circumstances that it would be quite easy to believe that one was watching a documentary on this topic. For that reason, he deserves to be in contention for Best Actor awards this year.Despite its subject matter, The Father can be funny at times, either because of the occasional boyish charm of Antony or because of the dramatic irony of the things that he says. There was one striking moment for me though, when I caught a glimpse of Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter, near the end of a sequence with Laura, a carer Anne had arranged to meet Antony for the first time that day. Antony was an engineer but up until that moment, amuses her with accounts of what he used to do. These seem like banter to me, rather than symptomatic of anything.If it wasn't for the review on Nightlife, I might not have thought to wonder if the film was playing tricks with me, with regard to a sequence with Antony and a woman telling him that she is his daughter. Later in the film you do get noticeable instances of characters unexpectedly appearing and reappearing again in different form. This is all part of the 'old person simulator' that I speak of. It's engaging as a cinematic device, as I like how it afforded me the opportunity to reinterpret what I had seen before and to try and grasp reality with this knowledge. One way to characterise this cinematic device would be to say that it messes with your head. That is in no way is a negative for the film. Some things remain mysterious without being annoying, like the 'other' daughter that Antony constantly speaks about but whom we never see.Despite the narrative device of an 'old person simulator' being used, I did find some moments more marked for perhaps inexplicable reasons. For example, there is one sequence where Antony overhears a conversation between Anne and her partner. This moment serves as bookends for a sequence. For some reason I found that bookended sequence more incongruous than anything else in the film.In the same way that I enjoyed reinterpreting what I had seen earlier in the film and feeling that I could touch reality with it, I wonder whether Antony could too, at the end. There is dramatic irony in the closing sequence and if Antony does gain the insight that the viewer can, you might feel sure that it is only momentary.Notes to self:* Listening to the music at the start of the film, I felt that it would be a Michael Nyman composition (a frequent collaborator with director Peter Greenaway) but the opening credits proved me wrong. Later on there is some, I assume, classical music which predates Nyman's compositions, which makes me think that the influence is going the other way, as far as Nyman is concerned. In any case, it might be worth buying the soundtrack to this album, as it seems to include both original compositions and classical music repertoire.* An initial query on my part as to the plausibility of the events of this film concerned the woman at the end of the film. I did wonder whether her patience with Antony was believable. Not long after that, I did wonder whether Anne's approach was believable too. In other words, it occurred to me that maybe this story of a daughter and her elderly father might be more believable in another context, for example, if set in France (the film is co-written as well as directed by Frenchman Florian Zeller, based on his earlier play). I'm not familiar with these scenarios in any case, so it might be easily plausible on both counts.* There was one concerning scene between Antony and Anne's partner, where Antony ended up crying. I did wonder whether the incident actually occurred or not.* Lastly, with regard to where the film ended up finishing, I am left to wonder whether what we saw from the start of the film actually occurs before then, as in the film being a sequence of temporal slices which actually happen and are witnessed by the viewer as they happen. If not, then that seems to me to make less incongruous that bookend scene where Antony overhears a conversation between Anne and her partner. However, it now does occur to me that maybe I am put in the position of Antony and one of his 'tests' for whether carers are thieves or not.",

After Silence of The Lambs, it's probably his best ever performance.The story is structured and edited in innovative ways to make us, the audience, feel as disorientated and confused as Hopkins, making us experience what he experiences in ways I don't think I've ever quite seen on film before (with the possible exception of Memento). It often feels closer to a horror film than anything else, but in a very quiet, sad, tender way that scares us by hitting so close to mundane, real world fears for ourselves and our loved ones, rather than through jump-scares, gore and violence.It's a very small story, impeccably played out by a very small cast, and perhaps some might find there's not enough surprises or a big enough payoff by the end. But it tells the story it has to tell perfectly well, and is by far the most powerful and compelling depiction of dementia ever put onscreen. I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out to be the best film I see this year, as well.",

            "content": "My sister-in-law and I chose this for our first post-lockdown cinema visit. Both of us have experience of having cared for parents with dementia, although that is not why we chose to see it: indeed, we struggled for a while making up our minds whether it would be wise to watch a movie that had great potential to be triggering. Given the option, we'd probably have chosen something more cheerful! In the end, our decision to watch it came down to the fact that we knew it was a well-regarded piece, and nothing else on our local picture house bill held any appeal at all.I'm glad we saw it. Florian Zeller is to be congratulated for his brilliant trick of playing with the audience's perceptions of who is who, where is where and even when is when, in order to offer some insight into what the world must feel like for someone descending into dementia. He should also be congratulated for the unflinchingly unsentimental treatment of the story. We are presented with the pain, sorrow, conflicted emotions and occasional flashes of humour that make up the \"loved one with dementia\" experience - sadly, one with which all too many people are familiar - without any overt attempts to manipulate our emotions or tell us how to think. \"The Father\" is a totally absorbing drama, and Anthony Hopkins (cast - almost disturbingly so - as a man called Anthony) inhabits the role with absolute conviction and believability, supported by a superb ensemble of top-notch talent.Without wishing to rain on its parade, though, I would raise a couple of points of detail re. The care of patients with dementia:1) In the final scene of the film, which takes place in a (clearly very expensive) care home, none of the staff is wearing a name-badge. They should be. It helps the patients keep some kind of grip on who is who in their lives.2) In the same scene, Anthony tries to describe how he is feeling. \"I feel as if I'm losing all my leaves,\" he says - to which the nurse replies \"What do you mean?\" WRONG: no trained dementia nurse would ever say such a thing to a patient. If the patient were able to assemble the words to express themself more clearly, they would do so, and requiring them to explain what they mean only heightens their distress and anxiety. I'm surprised that this slip-up was not spotted and removed from what is an otherwise excellent script.",

Same is true of the rest of the cast - they were all amazing, but that's not my point. What I want to speak about is the cinematic brilliance of this entire experience (as it was much more than just a movie).Let us begin with the fact that the whole story is seen through the eyes of the father - which means that we the viewers are as lost as he is. We can't tell what's going on and it shakes us to the core.Now, let's speak about camera angles, in this movie the camera angles talks. They tell us things that Florian Zeller wants to tell us without saying them aloud. Think about the number of times you saw a horizontal picture of a wall with a door cracked open in the middle, but the camera didn't get any closer it was kept were we could see the wall at both sides of the door. Because Florian Zeller wants us to know there's a wider picture here - we simply don't get to see it since he, the director, doesn't want us to see it. And now let's try and count the number of long corridors with closed doors on both sides, usually dark corridors this is an old visual hint that our hero is moving on an unescapable rout to his destiny. No matter what he does - this story will end the same waySo you see, I love this movie because on top of a great performance and a great story - it speaks cinema. And now think of the fact that this is Florian Zeller's first movie. All he did so far is write brilliant plays the very first time he does cinema, he speaks its language as fluently as the very best. If that's not genius I don't know what is.It's dark and depressing but it's a masterpiece you simply have to see.",

Both give great performances, and it really adds to the realism.But, there is one major issue that I can't overlook. The story gets very pale about half way through. I had to take multiple breaks because it felt so long. There's a lot of repetition, which is what the director and screenwriters wanted, but it does get boring since the audience has already seen this exact scene already.All in all, The Father brings a sad and realistic story that can and will get boring depending on who's viewing it.

Anthony is always looking at the window but never once do we see him go outside\n3) The way the film plays with time and narrative is genius. As an audience member we feel like we are the ones slowly losing our minds, just like Anthony. The way scenes loop back round on each other and get seen from slightly different perspectives really kept me engaged\n4) The emotion of the film was incredibly impactful to me, partly because I have experienced this to a certain extent in my family, but also because the film and the performances are masterfulNEGATIVES:1) Anthony became difficult to sympathise with at times when he was being rude, belittling or even hostile towards his daughter and his carer. I understand that this probably adds to the realism of the film, but as a character it made me find Anthony too frustrating at times\n2) I wish there was just 10 minutes at the end where we went back and saw the film objectively / through Anne's eyes.

Anyways, the cast is great.But probably what makes this movie different from everything I have ever seem is the structure of the story itself, the constant changing of scenarios, and actors or even characters suddenly, with often conflicting information been given by more than one character, puts you in Anthony's shoes, and see how just helpless a person on that situation feels like, and how insanely confusing everything is.The mix of this perfect story structure, with top notch performances, makes this movie just an immersive and breathtaking experience from start to finish.

As he tries to make sense of his changing circumstances, he begins to doubt his loved ones, his own mind and even the fabric of his reality.Anthony Hopkins continues to defy the years in a masterful performance. The 84-year-old Welsh actor received his second Academy Award since his first in 1992. Along side fellow Oscar winner, in 2019, nominated for her role in this picture, Olivia Coleman demonstrates the maturity and acting expertise to ensure Florian Zeller's watch is one of care and consideration. Seeing the pair's work in the film is entertaining enough, even if the storyline is slow and sterile. The movement is a psychological challenge for Anthony who's mental frame is deteriorating much to his reluctance. The character glistens in fragments of the spectacle, shining in his quirky actions and vibrant personality which contrasts to his cold-hearted moments of refusal in light of assistance, particularly from his daughter, Anne. Coleman is the resting shoulder offering her services and help that the former requires, she is understanding in her outlook and emotional in the turbulence of events. The two were rightly credited for their displays, and are showcase respectively that they are getting better with age.The film reminds us as an audience the importance of family. Those older than us may no longer be themselves in the future and see us in a different light. It highlights the value of love and appreciating every moment we spend in life with family members and friends. The Father is an illustration of a reality check we all ought to take, depicting serious, philosophical subjects in an honest fashion to convey its moral message.Picture perfect!",

            "content": "Dementia.\nSpoiler, this may not end well, but that's not the point.In Florian Zeller's \"The Father\", a one room play turned expertly into a gripping two hours of cinema, the blubbery heartbreak or the cheerleadery miracle usually reserved for this genre are absent. Instead we are tricked into inhabiting Anthony Hopkin's wandering mind. And it is an unsettling, frightful, place, where surroundings shift, names change, events may or may not happen, bluster resides, and paranoia reigns. Perspective is thrown out the window. Yet each vignette seems real enough to believe. The hopeful ones are easy to cling to. The harsh ones are shattering.As his taxed daughter, her father's lone connection to a world that is slowly leaving him, Olivia Colman makes this a two actor tour de force. Her conflict, to live for herself or offer selfless support, is an anvil sized weight on both of their minds. Yet it is unclear which direction she favours, if in fact she favours any at all. Sprinkled with just enough amusing asides - the obsessive infatuation with and reliance on a watch for instance - there is enough levity for Hopkins to stretch like he's never stretched before. The two leads are fabulous on screen.Just as the play starts to roll, it changes gears. The flat is different. The characters too. A promised plan is no longer on the table. What is this? Who are they? Where are we? What is reality? And who's reality is it? Infuriating, but cleverly diabolical, these curve balls are subtle enough not to jar, but they do build to a powerful crescendo. It is a bit of an accomplishment to deliver a series of deliberately confusing acts without losing the audience to frustration. Oh there is frustration, but that is part of the experience. This is not an easy view, but a worthwhile one.hipCRANK",

My grandmum remembers my sister who comes there sometimes, but seems to forget me who go back home town only once or twice a year.This movie is depicted from the perspective of dementia patient. It's filled of a lot of sadness, but is also splendid.If it's depicted from the perspective of a person who supports dementia patient, it's probably easier to empathize to him/her. I'm sure it's tough when a person who I love is getting to forget me gradually and becoming like a kid. I can imagine it a little.Through the perspective of protagonist, he didn't realise that he got demented. He just feels that everyone says disconnected words. Something which he can't understand happanes. But he believes he saw someone for sure and listened to something even if anyone says that it's not true. But that's surely true for him. When he talked about things that he heard the day before, her daughter told him that she didn't say that on that day. Also, the next day, she fed up with that because she told that before. That's why it's so confusing. Everyone 's confused. Nobady's fault.It is he, not anyone else, who suffers from dementia the most. I hope we can find the way to a cure for such a sad illnesses which suffers them and people who they love soon in the future.",

Confused, confused with everything, confused with his feelings and confused why people don't understand what happens to them.It is certainly one of the best films I have ever seen in my life, it is about a daughter's true love towards her father, it is about the obstacles that she has to face in relation to her illness and the extent to which she could take it this ...

A new way of narrative technique were we just fell along with Anthony and the surprises on his way and the revelations that he is undergone. He was exceptional in his role and that is unquestionable because we saw the shade in the well-known Hannibal Lector. This one is completely opposite to it because the physicality is even less here than in The Silence of Lambs. Here he is an octogenarian, a man struggling with dementia. Hopkins wonderfully carried that character. Not but the least Olivia Colman's Anne was also superb. Hats off to the production designer and the Editor too.",

This film really messes around with time, reality, and perception in such a fascinating, confusing and heartbreaking way that seemed really special and unique.It's definitely worth the watch especially for Hopkins breathtaking performance alone.",

Hopkins didn't impress me nor did the script or anything else.

What is scarier is that this is a real possibility for me. As I get older, I worry about it more and more. Genetically, we thought my paternal grandmother had Alzheimer's (when it was first being recognized). Then, my father \"had the cardiovascular system of an 80yo\" in his 40s. Blamed cigarettes. Fast forward to when I was 40yo. A neurologist told me I had a problem that is only found in 80yo people or \"is there something genetic to this?\" Well. I've been terrified since.Now, what these people SHOULD have done was have photos of his daughters/wife around him AND a current calendar. This helps so much (till they become really out of control and think everyone is conspiring, but not many places mass produce calendars for the future with all sorts of information on them). Even then, you can reason with them to a point. My grandmother was so much better with 100 calendars, and we kept old ones with photos of her (and grandpa) together: A calendar from 1925 accompanied by photos of her, gramps and my father as a baby. Just a tip to try to help anyone reading this. You'll do anything to spare them this if you can.Ok, the movie, I'm sorry: Excellent and devastating. The acting was wonderful, and I'm glad they didn't have a huge cast. Two Olivias playing Anns. Truly a heartbreaking movie and I cried more than once. And to add to the sadness, you have to see everyone else's point of view. The struggling daughter, the impatient husband, the young caregiver trying to be the good girl which mingled more with his mind...it was a rough ride. But I do NOT regret watching it. I'm going to suggest my children and grandchildren watch it as well.",

He excellently represented the inner conflicts and emotions of his character that the audience also felt. He is one of the best names in acting even when he is old. Secondly, storytelling was incredible. This kind of storytelling is something that many of us have never experienced before. Even though it got really confusing, it felt really realistic in a way that you think you are actually suffering from it. With the combination of storytelling and acting, you can easily get into the story. Finally, the length of the movie was just okay. I think it would get really out of hand if the movie was about 2.30 hours long.However, I didn't like the complexity that the movie tries to create very much. I know it is the point of it, but it starts to make everything harder for the audience, in my opinion. I believe it is not a good idea to reveal the truth after creating so much confusion. I think this way because, after a moment, you can't remember every detail about the previous scenes, and it becomes hard for you to make connections and realize the reality in the movie. I know that the last scene of the film was powerful. But it still annoyed me a bit and dropped my pleasure of watching because I couldn't grasp what was actually going on. Maybe, that is the point.",

Another theater play brought to the cinema, as it has been in fashion lately, but what an extraordinary way to do it. This is the film that answers the question that we all must have asked ourselves even for a brief moment: \"what would it be like to live with dementia?\" Through the direccional choices we are transported to Anthony's mind and, consequently, confronted with a distorted perception of reality which, no matter the effort we make to understand, ends up being incomprehensible.The film lives and dies by its interpretations (like any good play) and Oliva Colman and Anthony Hopkins are at the peak of their game. Olive with a measured, smooth, but meaningful interpretation; Hopkins in the best performance of his career (and that's saying something!) shows us everything he is capable of, starting the film full of layers that will be removed throughout until nothing is left, the confidence and charm that we know of so many psychopaths that he's portrayed until the vulnerability of a small child and with everything in between.The director only admitted to making this film with Anthony Hopkins in the main role, hence the name of the character, and we can understand why.When, at the end, you hear the rustle of leaves as the camera flies over the park, we are left with a thud in our hearts and are overwhelmed by the fear that one day we will be able to experience in ourselves what we have just experienced on the screen. Still, this is an exercise that we should all do, everyone should see this film.Deep, Touching, ... Terrifying, here is: The Father.Undoubtedly the Film of the Year and the Interpretation of a Lifetime!",

The fragmented narrative not only enhances the sense of suspense, but also peels off the reality of the later life layer by layer, adding a heavy weight to the hearts of the audience. Although there are many films about Alzheimer's disease, there are few that can make the audience of all ages have such practical experience. From this level, this film should not only remember Hopkins's exquisite acting skills, but also applaud the humanistic care of this film. It is one of my biggest regrets in 2021 that the film group did not make the film and brought more viewers to see it.",

That's because it's an extremely emotional film, I didn't cry in the cinema but I did when I was alone in my car. Anthony Hopkins is incredible, as is Olivia Colman and the supporting cast including Olivia Williams and Mark Gatiss.It's a disorientating film, hard to know when one scene ends and another starts. Often there is repetition of the same dialogue, altered through slight changes in setting and major changes in character as seen through the eyes and mind of the father. I'd say it's one of the most original films I've seen, in terms of its structure, both in the way the story is told and how the audience along with the father is unsure of who's who. It very much reminded me of Michael Haneke's, Amour, in places, especially the inner city grandiose setting of the flat.

She had lived with us for 15 years helping to raise my kids, and it was nice having her be a part of our family until the very end.There are many things in this movie that just don't comport with the reality of how a family deals with a family member with Alzheimer's. Good families know how to de-escalate situations, and to create a safe environment for the family member with Alzheimer's. You don't question or raise doubt about something they should have remembered from yesterday. It does not help. This includes the end of the moive when Anthony gets the full attention of his nurse caregiver who is there even to go on two walks a day with him. Based on my experience with multiple memory care facilities in the USA, that level of care is simply not to be found. When I checked my mom into facilities for short respite stays, the cost is very high, the food, and quality of care is marginal at best. No one gets individualized care. One place left my mom in a wet bed all day. If it were not for my business trips I would have kept her home all the time.If you wanted to create a movie that showed how hard it can be on a family to care for someone with Alzheimer's they could have showed changing wet bedding every day, or the struggle of getting them into a bathtub to take a bath. My mom would cause ringing in my ears from screaming as I try to give her a bath. Bottom line, this movie was not very true to the reality of the situation family members face.However Anthony Hopkins did a tremendous acting job worthy of his Oscar winning performance and the cinematography of this movie was amazing. It was very inventive how the scenes worked to confuse the audience and give us a sense of what Alzheimer's is like. For these reasons alone the movies deserves a viewing, even though I found it frustratingly removed from the reality of caring for someone with this horrible disease.",

He doesn't deceive us by inserting distasteful pathetic music choices but rather uses music only when it is really warranted and doesn't take anything from the performances away. Thus a healthy co-existence is created and the film doesn't feel emotionally manipulative.As I said, this is a devastating film whose overall nature lingers with you long after the credits roll.

What's really special about the movie is that it descusses a real life issue that we all see and hear about every day. And just picturing the agony of these old people is torturing. Imagine what it would be like as your world falls apart around you, as every minute passing in front of you does nothing but assure you more of your inability, as you hurt the ones you love most by just wanting to live on your own in your flat . That's what generates the great collapse of (I need my mommy to come and fitch me) in the end.

I somewhat disliked Olivia Coleman since her Peep Show days purely for her looks (yes, I was that shallow) and probably biased by her character in the same. Years gone by, staggering performances delivered, but I was still 'iffy' about her (imho!). After The Father I've changed my mind finally. She's an amazing actress and a wonderfully beautiful human being.Third edit here. This is an addendum. Come to think of it during the watch I was vaguely reminded for some reason of a film called Locke. And then I remembered that Olivia was in it as well. Huh.

The Father doesn't just tell a story about the character Anthony and his scenario, rather it places us into the mind of Anthony and his mental deterioration, showing us the heartbreak that is experienced by the ones around him and the confusion and even acceptance of his own situation. At one point, Anthony' consciousness fully acknowledges that he is a burden to his family members in a dramatic, and devastating scene. It's unsettling and sad, and the films depiction of caring for a loved one with dementia is what we possibly may experience later in our lives, even now. And it's this idea of empathy through the audience and fictional characters that Florian Zeller communicates through the film with his heartfelt and unbearable narrative.I happened to catch this in theatres today, as it's my first time back since a year now. I never realized how much a luxury the theaters are and the impression it could make on an individuals connection to a film. For some reason, the fact that I was watching the movie in a theatre rather then in a living room felt more impactful to the nature of the story. Again that idea of empathy, the closeness with the characters I witnessed through gazing at the big screen. I give credit to this from the cinematography and camerawork, writing, and especially the acting from Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman. What largely made an impact on me was this film's transitory depiction of home. The people we rely on to define us may suddenly seem unrecognizable, and that's just disturbing. But I think Zeller's use of empathy also provides us with an alternative effect of comfort on the viewers.",

I'm only saying this to signify how uneasy it can be.It's difficult to write about this film immediately after seeing it therefore I'll keep this post short and casual.Firstly, it's a play adaptation and it is visible that the film is kept in the spirit of the stage performance. Setting is fairly static, performances strong and the film language limited to the realist-impressionist style.Secondly, this film really does a great job showing how the dementia might feel for the ones affected with it the most directly (the ones who actually suffer it, inside their heads). Mixing times, faces, events, places while still trying to keep the bits of own identity as well as to make sense of the happenings progressively lacking in the immediate coherence is painful to watch from a perspective of an informed spectator, knowing what is going on - contrary to the main protagonist of the film - and having had witnessed similar illness in the past.Finally, my purely subjective view on this film is that this the film and the performances that should be talked about. After Quo Vadis, Aida? The Father is another 10/10 film and together they highlight the mediocrity of relatively popular, recent films such as Sound of Metal and Promising Young Woman which for some strange reason seem to get the most of critical as well as public attention this award season.",

Of course, the script is an adaptation of a play; that probably helps.The movie takes us through a never-ending ever-more-confusing maze of constant shifts and changes in Anthony's? Day-to-day life. Whenever the audience thinks it might know the? Construction of the plot, it is thrown out of its assumptions when Zeller adds yet another? Fragment of confusion. We start doubting everything along with the main character; is his daughter married? - and to whom? - is? She going to Paris? - it is? His apartment, right? - what is happening?!Everything - the changing casting, decor and script - makes us lose our bearings. Is it morning? Is it evening? And what? About the chicken? What chicken?The Father is hard to watch and recognizable? To the extreme. It prevented me from going to sleep for more than an hour? After watching it; it's that disturbing.

            "content": "If you liked:\nNebraska\nAmour\nRelic\"The Father\" is one of the 2021 Oscar frontrunners, a heartbreaking drama about aging. An old man named Anthony is refusing help from his daughter as he ages. They are at a point when the child is worried enough about their parent to try to get them a professional carer; and the parent, fighting for the last bits of their independence, is proud enough to insistently believe that they can perfectly manage on their own. A terribly awkward situation for both to find themselves in and although we sort of side with Anthony in the beginning; we eventually do see that his mind starts to slowly disintegrate and fragment, starting with simple forgetfulness, and ending up with a nasty habit of believing that everyone is out there to steal from him.What makes this movie so unique and borderline genius is that we see the whole story from Anthony's perspective only. He is clearly showing early signs of dementia; and we only get the side of the picture that he himself recognizes and sees through his confused memory and eyes; to the point where we ourselves become paranoid and confused. The faces are confusing, the time of the day is confusing, the surroundings are confusing. Because of that, the film isn't constructed like a dull drama, but rather as a some twisted kind of mystery thriller bordering on horror. Probably most of us have at least once contemplated on our own mortality and the paralyzing fear of losing one's memory as we become older. This film is not scary-horror, but it should scare the stuffing out of anyone, since this problem is universal for all of us humans. The prospect of getting lost in your own head is far scarier and far more real than anything some Boogeyman from a generic horror film can throw at us. It's what I have been afraid of ever since I could think hard enough. It's also one of the reasons why I became a biologist, I am planning to delve into Biology of Aging research so that we can live healthier lives as we get older, and avoid this kind of horror in our lives and the lives of our loved ones.All of this was brought to life by the never-changing excellency of my favorite actor Anthony Hopkins, rightly earning Hopkins his 6th nomination; and the superb directing of Florian Zeller, for which he confusingly wasn't nominated, but his film did get the \"mysterious\" Film Editing nomination for all those cuts that made the confusion of a fading mind tangible.This brutally real film won't provide you with any answers, but it will give you a ton of questions to ponder on. Comparatively very short, running for 90 minutes only, it is definitely one of the best films of 2020 that nobody should miss. Available in some theaters.",

And if someone have real life experience with such situation, this movie will hit even harder (better grab the tissue box in this case).No need to say that acting was superb - you'd expect that with Hopkins in the main role - he was the perfect choice (which was kinda the only choice from what i've read in the trivia). You really feel the confusion and struggle at times.The movie was shot beautifuly, yet quite confusing (intentionally so). That allows you to immerse even more in the story and the mindset of the main character. There are so many small details changing constantly that maybe you'd have to watch it 2-3 times to get all of them. You may not see them, but subconscious you notice and you just feel that something is \"not right\".Well deserved Top250 spot.P. S.

One of my biggest fears is slowly losing my memory and not being able to recognize the people I love wholeheartedly, and this movie made sure I cried a river of tears throughout the beautiful journey of watching it. Anthony Hopkins is, without a doubt in my mind, a fantastic actor who helps this movie shine. The story is phenomenal and, at one point, I legitimately thought I was watching someone suffering from Alzheimer's.If the movie didn't throw the word \"Anthony\" at me every now and then, I can be certain that I wouldn't even remind myself that that man is Anthony Hopkins.I always see actors and actresses but I also allow myself to establish an emotional connection with their characters.There are very few movies that I have watched where I completely forgot I was watching a movie, and this is one of those movies. I got lost in the movie as Anthony got lost in his mind. In the very end, I didn't see Anthony Hopkins, I saw an old man suffering from a horrible disease. I sincerely hope Hopkins gets an Oscar for the genuine tears he spawned on my eyes.It's a beautiful film and you won't regret watching it!",

            "content": "This film was one of the most raw and most real movies I have watched. It tells the story of one of the worst diseases humanity faces in such a gut-wrenching way, staying away from the sometimes unnecessary and drawn out melodrama that film tends to produce. What makes this film so beautiful is the fact that we experience the film through Anthony's perspective (save a scene or two). Though Anthony is the being that suffers from the illness, we are there with him. We feel the confusion and the desperation for fulfillment. We crave answers to the questions that are posed to us through Anthony's eyes. He wants to know who he is, what he's doing, and what's going on around him, and we want the same. In this way, Anthony's experiences become ours. We see what he sees, and we feel what he feels.Something I want to make note of is the film's setting, which takes place mainly in a few flats. The sets are all complicated - there are numerous doorways, a clutter of furniture, and several different rooms. The disorganized set is so carefully designed to mimic Anthony's mental space. Just like parts of his brain are hard for him to access, it is hard for us to assuredly recognize the characteristics of the flats and to easily notice the switching between them. This is all excluding one single part of each flat: the doorway at the end of the hall. The way that the camera always steadily follows Anthony in and out of that room highlights the inevitable truth of the situation... As Anthony continues to rely on the solitude that the room at the end of the hall offers him, the eery shots of it force us into reckoning with the uncomfortable truth that Anthony won't be able to escape to it forever. Though the film chose not to display Anthony's eventual death, we all know that it's soon to come. Instead, the film shows one last heartbreaking moment where Anthony cries for his mother, stripping his mind and being into the likes of a child's.",

Even tho I have never experienced anything in a form of dementia in my life, I could feel the realism and tragedy that is going on. Anthony Hopkins gives one of (if not the) greatest performance of his career. He nails every aspect of his character. From the big memory loss moment to the subtle little movements, everything has meaning and consequences. I would also highly recommend watching it twice. The first time you will experience the movie with the main character and try to puzzle everything together. The second viewing you will appreciate the story a lot more. There are a lot of little moments and sequences that make the story even more complete. Some scenes go on for a bit to long, but it all works out at the end. It didn't hit me as hard as I thought it would at the end, but it still left me with an appreciation for dementia and everyone who has been in contact with this horrible disease.",

After watching the film, it's so interesting to see that that perspective is like Anthony's perspective throughout the movie, it was like the trailer made you feel what he was feeling; I don't know if that was intentional, if it was, very well done.This story is heart breaking. You basically watch as this elderly man slips further and further into dementia, until he eventually regresses into his child self. He feels as though people are constantly out to get him, and sometimes you don't know it they are or they aren't; telling this story from his perspective allows you to go through a disorienting experience that gets you to put pieces together and interpret things in different ways, which I so appreciate more than maybe showing it from the daughter's perspective, where it would end up just being a series of linear events.I'd recommend this to anyone that can watch something like this.

He refuses all help from his caring daughter Anne, brilliantly played by Olivia Coleman who delivers such a memorably endearing Oscar and Golden Globe Award nominated performance for Best Supporting Actress, showing the pain and the utter sorrow of watching helplessly as her beloved father slowly slips away.

Most of the plot, though broken in parts, was easily followed, however, the ending progressed so quickly, that it was slightly lacking.....\nIt detailed perspective from not only a carer's perspective (in this case, his last surviving daughter) but, more importantly, from the father's own view (often through many confused states of awareness in one day), which changed so often that it would make our 'unaffected' heads spin.I wish I'd seen this movie while my own mum was still alive.Everyone, if you have a parent/grandparent who is dealing with this debilitating condition, please try your best to access it - easily done via SBS on demand, with a simple search using Anthony Hopkins's name, or the movie title. It'll take less than 2 hrs of your time, but well worth it.It helped answer questions I'd had for 4+ years of care of my own parent, but also carried the full hurt of understanding how my mum must have felt when she, on occasion, awoke in bed, asking me where she was & why, in her own home of 50+ years.Even though it can be uncomfortable to watch, any frustration I felt while caring for mum paled into insignificance after seeing this film. It holds knowledge that can help you, better help them & in my view, should be on every family's watchlist.",

We celebrated her 87th birthday few months ago and last week I visited her, I asked her how old she is, she replied 63. She would go on to tell me about her childhood for the hundredth time but I listened like it was the first because she is always so invested in the story that she literally cries and laughs when explaining her stories. As it was getting dark, she would try to get up from her seat saying that she needs to hurry and cook some meals, as her son will reach soon from work. She'd try to get up and say the same thing..She hasn't entered the kitchen in decades and hasn't seen that son in a decade, he passed away 11 years ago.Do watch this movie, it will hit you like a brick wall if you are just getting about dementia and will knock you out cold if you have a relative with the same condition.",

These roots show throughout the film, which relies on only 2-3 sets and uses a sparse cast of characters. This minimalist setup forces much of the film to be carried by the acting. Thankfully the film is in good hands with both Hopkins (who started his career on the stage) and Colman as leads.The story of dementia in a film is not necessarily unique, but the nature of the storytelling is, and the way it unfolds brings the audience into the stress dementia can introduce into everyone's lives. Violent or shocking moments in the film become questioned as easily as the name and face of a supposed close contact. It's thought-provoking to participate in, but also draining. Thankfully the runtime is only 90 minutes as I do not know if I could have taken much more.Thankfully the movie does not wear its point thin.

            "content": "What a beautifully constructed film. The intricate film-making creates such an immersive experience, the audience real delve into the life of the characters, which in this case is quite a heart-breaking place to be, despite its striking reality. This is especially effective in such a contained setting, which is just one of the many brilliant directorial decisions made in The Father.You see this is really a very simple film. There are only a few characters, which gives more room for each to be fully fleshed out, which allows us to engage with each person and their role in the story a lot more. The narrative is told somewhat in a linear manor but fuddled up and moved around to reflect the state of mind of Anthony Hopkins' character (sort of similar to that of Memento) and that's it. Only that isn't it, although technically so little is done so much effect is made, this story benefits so much from simplicity because there we have so much. So much raw emotion and so much heart-breaking realism. You really feel like you are in this world firstly as a viewer, but then you begin to question yourself and your own perception and sense of being and when everything becomes clear at the end of the film you instead think of the people around you and not yourself. You think of those close to you, your family or anyone who is slowly losing touch with themselves and the world around them, only able to hold onto a few fragments of their memories. And that hits you like a ton of bricks.I watched this with two of my friends in the cinema a few weeks ago and all of our reactions when the film had finished was around the lines of \"I want to call my Mum... I want to check up on my Grandad. ... I miss ...\". That's impact for you. I think that gives you plenty of reason to watch this film if you are emotionally stable enough to be taken through the ringer quite a bit. But oh my what a beautifully tragic piece of cinema.",

And well there can be expressions of violence and gore in some film, at least that expression is perhaps more blatant.As I found this film to be disturbing and sad.You are pulled into the main character, Anthony's life as he loses his mind to dementia. In a setting that ultimately becomes a world that has no time for such insanity. Where people get taken somewhere, and put away, to let someone else deal with them.That reality is very real. And more horrific than any gory horror film.Anthony Hopkins who plays the character of Anthony, is a great actor, but he could likely be just playing himself, as he has reached an age when losing parts of ourselves is the reality. And so I don't see it as an award worthy performance. But who am I to say and well I'm certainly not involved in all the politics that go into those ceremonies.Watch it, if you're curious. Most will probably feel some sort of complaisant agreeability with the story. Empathize.

Florian Zeller wrote the stage play, wrote the adapted screenplay (with help from Christopher Hampton), and directed the film. (Sheesh!)Immediately after watching all 8 2021 Best Picture nominees, I ranked The Father #6 out of 8. After watching for the second time, I think it probably should've been upped to 4 or 5. Even though I still think there were better films in the mix, I have yet to get over how PHENOMENAL this film's screenplay, performances, and general production were.Other than Best Picture, The Father was nominated for five other awards at this year's Oscars: Best Actor (Anthony Hopkins), Best Supporting Actress (Olivia Colman), Film Editing, Production Design, and Best Adapted Screenplay. Per usual, I completely agree with all of these nominations, but I would've liked to see Cinematography in there as well. The cinematography was simple yet so well executed. There were many times where the camera stayed in one place as the characters moved around it, and it was notably impressive.Without a doubt, the two best aspects of the film were the screenplay and Mr. Anthony Hopkins (which aligns with the Oscar wins). The screenplay is original and a brilliant way to tell the story of dementia. Hopkins' performance in this film should be studied in acting school. He flips the switch from comfortable to scared at the drop of a hat, and he does it seamlessly. His expressions, body language, and tone are perfect for the role, and his Oscar is very well deserved.The search is still on for a film adapted from a play where we don't feel stuck in one location. Thankfully, the flat we were bound to in The Father was absolutely beautiful. It was charming and warm and the Opera music we heard so often added to that warmth aptly. Despite the lack of diversity, I ended up enjoying the production design quite a bit.Now, even after all of those wonderful accolades (and minor criticisms), I still wouldn't say that I was thoroughly entertained for the entire run-time. Many aspects wowed me, yet I still found myself to be a little bored. I was happy that the run-time was a short hour and 37 minutes because it felt repetitive once I understood what was happening. There didn't seem to be a real climax, although I did think the ending was pretty remarkable. I needed a bit more ebb and flow to keep me interested.Out of all the movies nominated for Oscars this year, this is definitely one you need to see.

            "content": "I watched many movies in my life, part of them was with amazing spaciel effect part of tham was realy epic but few of them really make me feeling emotions From the depths of my soul, this is movie like that. I think there is a lot of movies with special effect that hard to explain how they make this shot but it is even herder to make the viewer the identity themselves in the movie, Sometimes we watch movie from the heart not from the head.The power of the movie is the Characters of Anthony who played by Anthony Hopkins and Anne who played by Olivia Colman their Relationships of father and daughter is the heart of the movie. Anthony is Dementia sufferer and Anne is the one who take care of him but when she meet a guy and movie with him to Paris she must to find someone who will help to Anthony. Everyone who know person with Dementia will understand that, for me is close issue and sometimes it felt like i know Anne i can understand her motive and her action it is like the the director Florian Zeller placed a mirror in front of me and when you met yourself the movie is not just a movie it is kind of experience. I must say it was heartbreaking to watch how the Character of Anne it is hard to watch how she absorbing the mood of her father and didn't respondThis movie is Adaptation to a play by Florian Zeller ( the director of the movie) Full Disclosure I didn't watch the play but I think this movie did something that play never can do and this is to watch the point of view of Dementia sufferer we don't know what is the time or place Although the movie set in one location and this is thanks to the change of the apartment, this is the power of Cinematography.The thing the negative thing I can say about the is that i didn't like the Character of Paul who played by Rufus Sewell for me this Character is just there to be antagonist all he does is to complain and behave wickedly for me it make me to \"exit from the illusion\" . It is hard to for me to explain but for me it is the type of Character who is there just for the need of antagonist and not because it is necessary to the story .I think if you familiar with Dementia or you want drama movie go and watch this this movie otherwise I don't know if you love but you can try and consolidate your own opinion.",

In the age of overacting, this was refreshing indeed.We all know about Anthony Hopkins so I will say no more but he becomes everyone's elderly father the the duration of the movie.",

            "review_title": "Confusing, harrowing and at times horrifying",
            "content": "To put The Father into words is hard, because it is confusing, hard to follow and even understand at times. We see a man who is uncomfortable with aging, wants to retain his independence and at the same time is blissfully unaware that his issues can't be fixed.But that is only the top of the surface of Florian Zeller's film which is based on his play, and a screenplay he co-wrote with Christopher Hampton and a film Zeller also directed. Anthony(played by Anthony Hopkins) is 80 years old and has run off an aide his daughter Anne played by Olivia Colman hired to help him. Much like my Grandpa and I'm sure others all over the world have experienced with seniors, Anthony refuses aid saying he can manage on his own, and Anne shouldn't worry about him.Hopkins gives Anthony humor in this scene like his sarcasm when Anne tells him she's leaving for Paris as she's found someone and can't take of him 24/7, but then comes the first brutal line of the film when he realizes she's serious and says so you're abandoning me.Then we observe Anthony wandering around the apartment and he encounters another man sitting in the living room. He is befuddled, who is he? The man states he is Anne's husband and she is not leaving for Paris. Hopkins becomes defiant, saying he will not be forced to leave his flat to which the man states that this isn't his flat, Anthony has been living with Anne and her husband in their flat.Anne comes back, but to the horror of Anthony it's another woman, not Anne. Zeller's screenplay is labrynth-like, where every scene takes the audience down a path we aren't expecting. The film is at times very hard to follow, and truthfully for most of the film me and my Mom were confused.. Is Anthony losing it, are others trying to make him crazy, or what?Scenes repeat, things aren't what they seem and Anthony at one point asks why his other daughter never comes to see him. (In one of the key scenes, later on we learn why.) Hopkins performance is jaw-dropping particularly the scene where he meets the new aide his daughter brings in, he charms her and we see Anthony's charisma, humor and wit, but then he says she reminds him of Lucy in that she laughs inanely like her.Hopkins immediately reestablishes dominance by saying Anne is after his money, he's not crazy, he liked his other daughter more, Anne is cruel and manipulative and goes from charm to humiliating both the aide and Anne in the course of 1 scene.Also Hopkins with his eyes shows so much of Anthony's thoughts his anger, fear and confusion over what is happening to him, am I ok? He tries to maintain control telling the doctor his daughter takes him too that yes he knows his birthday, who he's staying with and so forth.Finally, we begin to understand that we are watching a man who is losing his sense of reality due to the illness that is controlling his mind. The aide tells him she heard from Anne about his other daughter and what happened to her and we see a photograph of Anthony, Anne and Lucy. We observe the other woman appear when the aide Anthony likes is supposed to come, and then we observe Anthony no longer at home.Anthony has most likely not been home either in his flat or daughter's flat for a while, and has clearly has lost sense of time, faces and what he knows. Finally, at the end Hopkins shows a man who finally realizes he has lost all control and in his final scene which I will not divulge BUT INSIST ANYONE WHO DOES TO BRING TISSUES... is horrifying, heartbreaking and absolutely gut-wrenching.Zeller's film which he takes major risks on by taking us on a journey of dementia is frightening and disturbing. But it is a powerful and important film that deals with an issue many of us sadly will encounter with loved ones, and features the genius of Olivia Colman and the brilliance of Anthony Hopkins.Hopkins nearly 30 years after his brilliance as Hannibal Lecter, once again demonstrates his brilliance with a performance that is almost operatic from humor, to drama, to pain, to horror and finally to tears. I'm so glad the Academy recognized this and for once got it right.",

Telling him that stuff he believes, isn't true, even though she told him exactly that it was the day before... I'm pretty sure I would have thought I was going crazy myself if I was in the father's place.In the end she gets the apartment, and I think she even got his expensive watch (we see at one moment that she has a watch in a box), while he rots in a home for people who can't take care of themselves.Final shot, the leaves of a tree, but are they yellow, are they almost ready to fall? No, they're bright green, full of life, for we know that he in fact still has all his head.Brilliant.",

A better suggestion is to view it again second time via DVD.Anthony Hopkin's rendition of an elderly man sinking into the quicksand of Alzheimer's is so perfectly Spot On.

What I really appreciated was that the story is told from his perspective, and you can feel his sense of confusion, loss and fear of having to let go. What was also depicted in an honest and nuanced way was the relationship between the parent and the child-caregiver. Olivia Colman did a fantastic job of conveying a sense of moral ambivalence between having to constantly take care of her father or to move on with her own life. While she does eventually take the decision, motivated in part by her partner, her lack of resolution is clear and her sense of guilt is relatable to anyone who is or has been in a similar situation. Really enjoyed the film.",

Shows a realistic and colourful world of everydayness, presents the characters rather stiffly but also shallow at moments.Entertaining, yet not for people who don't like life stories with bad endings, I'd say. Full of emotions, symbols and life and death contrasts.Worth rewatching and enjoying the masterful acting of Hopkins again.The most important piece of this story is that it is real and happening in millions of different places, to millions of different people, which is why it is done so well. A splendid movie, with even better acting and interpretation of characters.Majestic.",

I myself got very confused watching Hopkins' character realize he was in somebody else's flat and then it is revealed he is in his flat after all, or how each scene transcends into eternal madness, ending up in a hospital, with characters that change names and appearances as if they were in a spinning lottery wheel. I would have appreciated if the movie was also presented out of Anthony's point of view, but, I guess, this is the brutal and realistic depiction of someone suffering from dementia.Other than Hopkins and Colman the other characters just revolve and are here to confuse Anthony (that's the name of his character) and the viewer more. This confusion was made on purpose, like I said, to depict a person suffering from dementia and how his surroundings and his 'fabric of reality' start to fade around him. We watch as the most sophisticated phrases like 'manage on my own' is repeated countless times, and how the plot sequences start to repeat later on in the movie, and mostly feel straight up from a Quentin Tarantino non-linear narrative.Here's one example: Anthony meets a caretaker that reminds him of his daughter, Lucy, whom he has no idea has passed, and the next day the caretaker takes care of him. A painting he has had for a very long time has gone. The following day, it is revealed that he had the meeting with the caretaker a day ago and the caretaker looks like the daughter he couldn't recognize about an hour ago when I first started watching it.Plot aside, I like how Anthony and Anne are characters that feel like actual human beings, one with emotion, feelings like grief, one that we can at least sympathize with and they make their intentions clear, through their actions. Anthony is just an 80-plus year old man who insists he can manage on his own. His daughter, on the other hand, thinks otherwise as he keeps on forgetting things and mixing imagination with reality, and suggests a caretaker.A side villain who is almost as convincing pops up and is in disapproval for Anne to take care of her father as he is a 'nuisance' and demands her to send him to an institution, which actually happens at the end of the movie. Is this man her husband? Has she met someone else? Or is she already divorced?By the end of the movie, Anthony is already unable to bear his everchanging circumstances and cries for his mommy, which provokes pity, sadness and sympathy to the viewer. It's agonizing and haunting.Tag it for a re-watch.",

The Father will make you know how it feels to have dementia. How confusing and frustrating it would be. Anthony's fear of abandonment is the most heartbreaking part of the movie. On top of that, every little joy that he had, it lasted very short and we all know that it will be gone. At least the movie gave us a chance to hug him at the end but left us wondering which is reality or which is Anthony's scattered memories or was he in the hospital all this time?Just only Anthony Hopkins's acting is already made this movie worth watching. A masterclass without a doubt. On top of that, it's amazing how well this movie tell its story. The camera angles, costumes and the script are so refined.

And the saddened realization of all the missing time, all the gaps, the five years obviously lost between anne being martied and going to paris without a minute passing, the years of not seeing lucy felt as months and eventually the time gap from being an infant with a mother to being an old man with a daughter perceived as simultaneous. The film medium is strikingly well suited to depict this breakdown of time, chronology and causality, because it is the editing language by which we read film, hence his lack of mental grip over these becomes our frustration and our lack of comprehension, and yet still we can cinematically also read what he is left with - an association montage, scenes linked by resemblance only.",

The way that the story is told has absolutely given me a greater appreciation and sadness for Anthony, the main character.

The focus, it is worth paying tribute to Lena, is not particularly parasitic on a potentially tear-jerking plot and is more focused on plot delights. Anthony Hopkins is beautiful. A good, polite and, I would say, hygienic film about old age and the progressive descent into childhood... Schematically, almost the entire film takes place from the point of view of the protagonist himself. Only the last episode - in a boarding house for the elderly - a look from the outside. Of course, Hopkins' game is fascinating. What is only worth his baby crying with visits... Everything is vital, not scary, natural. It is known that venerable film critics consider the final scene vulgar-vulgar. But it didn't seem that way to me. Moreover, I have the opinion that this film is very restrained and the authors did not set themselves one of the goals specifically to squeeze tears out of the audience. Old age and withering is one of the aspects of life.",

Who exactly am I?\" and soon after begins to cry because he wants his mummy and there follows a scene that was devastating.I rarely cry at films, but this truly broke me.This film can be summed up in two words. Superb and heart-breaking.",

He is successful to find back his watch that represents his sense of control of time and memory. But in fact, he fails. And what's more sad is he finally loses himself out of control. So, time, memory and self are all broken. Not only Anthony Hopkins highly overlaps with the character, but also he perfectly performs the one at death's door, makes the film seem like a true record. Every plot and every frame comes to be foil.",

When Olivia Williams came along, I thought the film could go in two interesting ways. New people can fool the old man, which would be very bold in terms of the script. It can also be psychological Kafkaesque horror with constantly changing faces. The film tries to do just that, but lacks a sense of Kafka. This is an interesting film with very interesting actors.

It leads to disorientation and even as an audience member you can't tell which scene is real and which is imaginary.The main characters are wonderfully played by the actors because you can put yourself into their shoes. You can really sense the desperation and helplessness of the daughter and I am convinced that anyone in real life would react the same way.On the one hand, the plot really leads to confusion. Scenes are repeated, yet presented in a different way. On the other hand, the plot really catches your attention and you want to solve the mystery behind the film.

Florian Zeller did an amazing job in bring such a tragic disease from peoples minds onto the screen. The way that he was able to mimic the feeling of suffering from such a thing was immaculate. There was no way to tell what exactly was going on which so brilliantly represents the way that dementia can have an effect on peoples lives. The constant replaying of old memories was an excellent way to represent how someone in Anthony's position would feel, with each memory revealing just a little bit more to the story.

The way they illustrator every day as a New nightmare just perfectly captures the horror of this sickness.. I highly recommend anyone to watch this movie, prepare yourself for a confusing, scary and emotionel ride.Anthony hopkins is exceptionel in this movie, and everyone around him fits their characters perfectly. I bet he made the job easy for his co-actors in this one. Imbarresing that he did not get an award for this. He imerges to this character, like it was himself experiencing this.",

It made me cry and feel such empathy for the family.Anthony Hopkins was just wonderful and so genuine- sorry to all actors I know you are good but Anthony Hopkins acting was just first class.Olivia Coleman, as his daughter played the role with genuine sadness, loss of her childhood, and of a person exhausted by it all and was fantastic.Have to say, I was confused myself with the actor Paul slapping the Dad as in the last few minutes of the film the actor Paul appears as the nurse in the home/hospice. I would love to know if there was more to that or not.",

The look of confusion on his face and his beats he took, stumbles on words was so true!
