            "review_title": "Captures None Of The Fun Or Magic Of The Original",
            "content": "In 1996, the original Space Jam \"had something\", so to speak. Seeing Michael Jordan on the big screen interacting with the Looney Tunes was a first-of-its-kind sort of experience, and despite the ridiculous concept it worked perfectly. Sadly, this long-await sequel captures absolutely none of that magic or fun.For a very basic overview, Space Jam: A New Legacy sees Warner Brother's sentient artificial intelligence Al G. Rhythm (Don Cheadle) hatch a plan inside the \"server-verse\" to finally get the recognition he feels he deserves. Central to that mission? Abducting LeBron James and family to play in a high-stakes basketball game that pits father against son. Along the way, James must root out the old Looney gang for the epic court contest.I will readily admit that nostalgia for the original got me into the theater to see this sequel. Absolutely no doubt about that. However, I will not concede that the same nostalgia is preventing me from giving this one a better rating than 3/10. \"A New Legacy\" is just a bad movie, plain and simple, for numerous reasons...-Whereas Michael Jordan just had to show up and be himself in the original, here LeBron James is given the emotional heavy-lifting tasks. Predictably, it does not go well. He cannot believably convey a single emotion.-A lot of people are criticizing the decision to showcase so many WB properties (Harry Potter, Superman, Batman, Matrix, Game of Thrones, etc.) in this film. That didn't so much bother me, and I actually enjoyed the concept of a tongue-in-cheek poking fun at those topics. But it all comes crashing down when the finished product looks suspiciously like an algorithm-created property that the plot was trying to skewer!-The \"Looney Tunes playing basketball\" concept is no longer new (by virtue of the '96 effort), and nothing is done to spruce that avenue up whatsoever. Same old gags just replayed again. Also, the way we interact with athletes is so different now that James simply cannot command the cultural cache that MJ once did. Just having him physically present isn't enough like it may have been in the mid-90s.Overall, \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\" is a clunker, no two ways around it. It isn't the worst film I've ever seen (it got me to chuckle a few times), but it is almost completely devoid of any real emotion or fun, in stark contrast to its predecessor that is still considered one of the most fun films ever made.",

It feels like one part feeding Lebrons ego, one part nonsensical abysmal story, and ten parts promotional work for everything WB owns.The plot involving a computer algorithm as the main antagonist that somehow sucks LeBron and his kid into a server and then forced them to play the sons video game creation is the most half baked idea I ever heard. The acting by almost everyone involved is the furthest thing from believable possible. The whole thing is a lot of cgi flashy nonsense and nothing of real substance. This is just an embarrassment through and through.",

LeBron could have been substituted by a piece of wood with voice-over, and it would have had more personality.Agree that the original Space Jam wasn't some deep profound artistic achievement, but it was at least quirky and fun. This new version was so commercialized and shallow, that became intolerably annoying when it became evident why this movie was made.It was made ONLY for grifting purposes by a bunch of grifters. So if you don't want to give your hard earned money to opportunistic billionaires, then skip this money-grabbing scam project (can't bring myself to call this a 'film').",

Michael didn't have to shove his reputation down your throat because his reputation preceeded him. He's the best, that's it. LeBron tries to recreate that here artificially. He doesn't have the weight or presence that Michael had, so he's over compensating. Why make a second if it's not for story? Can Hollywood really profit off of such a failed story if they throw in some characters you know? Get ready for the commercial about LeBron that is space jam 2.

            "content": "Let's be honest: the original Space Jam was not a great movie. It holds nostalgia in our eyes because it starred the greatest basketball player of all time next to some of our favorite cartoons. However, the original Space Jam looks like a classic compared to this overly produced mess of a sequel.First off, let's get something straight. LeBron James is an amazing basketball player and he's very popular with young adults. However, he does not have the same aura about him that Michael Jordan did. MJ came at a time when being a celebrity wasn't so ubiquitous like it is now with the Internet and social media. Also, media is so fragmented now that we really don't have those \"shared\" experiences like we once did. EVERYONE knew MJ and the Chicago Bulls, basketball fans or not. I'm not sure LeBron has that same appeal. Also, even if people didn't like MJ, they respected him. Maybe it's because he gets political, or maybe because he switches teams, I don't know why, but LeBron is much more polarizing. Maybe it's just the cultural climate we live in today, but there are a lot of people who straight up don't like the guy.The second thing is how corporate this movie is. So many product placements and pseudo commercials all over the place. It takes people out of the story and makes it feel like you are just watching endless commercials for 120 minutes.Third, 120 minutes is way too long for families. 90 minutes or less. Kids loss attention after that. So do adults.This movie is fine if you are looking for something to do for 2 hours, but there are better ways to spend that time than watching a lukewarm, unnecessary, over the top commercial showcase designed as a sequel to Space Jam.",

LeBron, please promise the world this is the last movie you will ever be in. Nothing in this movie is believable. I really feel sorry for actors like Don Cheadle and Michael B. Jordan who somehow got roped into doing this snooze-fest. My guess is that they were fulfilling some clause in their contracts or just owed someone a favor, because no one in their right mind would have read this script and used it for anything other than toilet paper. I will leave you with my last thought, as I was going to rip apart all of the scenes, but I thought I would leave this as a no spoiler warning. Anyone over the age of 10 should walk, no, run away from this movie.",

            "content": "This may be the most patronizing, soulless corporate hackery passed off as a movie instead of the near-two-hours commercial that it is for WarnerMedia IPs and its product-placement partners I've ever seen, and I've seen the first \"Space Jam\" (1996), as well as Steven Spielberg's \"Ready Player One\" (2018) that this sequel crassly rips-off. I was under the impression that I subscribed to HBO Max for new movies--not for advertisements to subscribe to the streaming channel I'm already subscribed to. At least, the original \"Space Jam\" made some sense; it was about basketballer Michael Jordan playing basketball to win his right to be paid for his brand against a slave-capturing amusement park, Moron Mountain... I said it only made some sense. In the pretentiously-titled sequel threatening a franchise, \"A New Legacy,\" basketballer LeBron James plays a video game to win his right not to be digitized and turned into an obnoxious movie brand, but that's exactly what the real King James did in agreeing to do this obnoxious, digitized branding movie. Oxymoron Mountain.Besides Warners pretending to be against the very thing the fictional Warners is doing in its movie and what the real company did in making it--i.e. A faux indictment against what movie culture has become as brought to you by one of the biggest multinational conglomerates behind said culture--and James playing a character with more apparent character than his brand really has, we get the stupidest of father-son relationship dilemmas. Stop wasting time creating a game, son, and concentrate on playing this other game instead, and stop having fun, 'cause I'm the grumpy old man of throwing a ball through a hoop. All of it would be more tolerable, too, if the Looney Tunes were allowed to remain traditionally-animated cartoons instead of computer animations that are, then, turned into even-uglier computer animations. Or if weren't so cloying. Or overly hyperactive even for Looney Tunes. Cartoon basketball was bad enough, but overwrought video-game cartoon basketball as observed by every IP in WarnerMedia's vault--and that move as convincingly as the generic fans in an NBA 2K video game--manages to be so much worse.Even if a joke here or there is almost funny, it doesn't matter. (The best may be the Michael Jordan cameo, which I saw coming, but still wasn't bad. Most of them, though, involve more branding, such as cartoon James's fall creating a hole in Looney Tunes land the shape of the Nike swoosh logo, or his attempts to recruit DC superheroes, which are also owned by Warner.) That's because the entire thing is so ugly, hackneyed and ultimately insulting to the intelligence of the viewer-customer that it cannot be redeemed. A movie must have some underlying value--it needs a soul, to be forgiven. This one doesn't.",

            "content": "LeBron James worked hard to be the greatest and he's not about to let his son Dom be a slacker. Instead of basketball, Dom only wants to be a video game designer. WB's new computer algorithm Al G. Rhythm (Don Cheadle) wants to use LeBron's popularity to dominate the social media space. After LeBron rejects the offer, Al G. Rhythm kidnaps LeBron and Dom into the computer world. LeBron has to play a basketball game to win freedom for himself and his son. LeBron is sent to Tune World where he finds a lonely Bugs Bunny.LeBron is a functional actor and I like the older style Looney Tunes cartoon world. I love the Michael B. Jordan bit. I like some bits in this movie but it's way too long and too much of this is below par. The best part of this movie is Bugs Bunny in his Looney Tunes world and then they go off to various franchises to search for the rest of his friends. I like all of that. I like the animation style. Quite frankly, an animated LeBron James allows him off the hook for his acting. His voice is unique and works well for animation. Turning him in cartoon is a good thing. He doesn't have to act. He should stay a cartoon until he wins the game.His son Dom is a big problem. He's a brat. The excuse is that he gets enticed by Al G. Rhythm but it's a sorry excuse. At no point is he concerned about being in a computer simulation or about his father. The solution lies in Al turning Dom into a monster. When LeBron has his big emotional speech, Dom can slowly turn back into a boy looking to hug his father. That is much better characterization and progression in his story arc.Finally, this movie is hella busy and way too long. It is almost two hours long. The game is almost an hour long. They need to cut out at least fifteen minutes if not more. There is so much chaotic action that the long game section grows tiresome. People are excusing this for being a kids movie. Some of these references are going right over those kids' heads. They are not going to get A Clockwork Orange. For people who get all the references, this is bad for them. For kids who don't get the references, there's no point to it. This movie has fun bits. I love the Looney Tunes animation section. I don't like them digitized into computer animated. The plot is bad simplistic writing. The father son conflict could have been done better. This is way too long and that pushed me over the edge.",

Lee's film is nothing but a James love-fest moulded in with a dream Warner Brothers marketing department idea that is going to make some serious money for the company over the coming months/years.To be fair, A New Legacy isn't a complete write-off, upon initially hearing about another Space Jam taking shape under the guidance of James and Black Panther director Ryan Coogler's hand as a producer, one would've been sane enough thinking things could only turn out very badly for all involved but Lee's film isn't bereft of decent ideas and fun moments that come and go through its close to two hour run-time and there's a nostalgic joy getting to once more see the Loony Tunes gang get a moment in the spotlight but thanks to James's atrocious acting skills, a big collection of flat jokes and an incessant push from the film to cram in as pop culture references as it can allow, A New Legacy is more often than not a chore to sit through and one that potentially will bore its young audience rather than capture the imaginations of them.Seemingly taking inspiration from Ready Player One's rulebook, once James gets sucked into a computer-verse run by Don Cheadle's delusional A. I Al G. Rhythm and forced to compete in a world changing Basketball match against his own son whilst reuniting a disbanded group of Loony Tunes members, there's an obsession with A New Legacy to throw everything at as from a cameo point of view with everyone from the Joker, Mad Max and Harry Potter getting a run (or strangely enough for a kids film Austin Powers or A Clockwork Orange) and when the film resorts to scenes such as Porky Pig in a rap battle or James and Bugs Bunny going into the Matrix you really do start to wonder what the film is trying to do or who its trying to do it for?Thankfully for us and for James's reputation he ends up spending half of the film in animated form, saving us from more high school level of acting talents that would've further dampened A New Legacy's struggle to find itself and stand on its own two legs, as it ends up feeling like nothing more than a reminder to us all that James is the greatest athlete on the planet (did you know?) and that you should probably buy some his or Warner Brothers merchandise if you haven't already.Final Say -Saved by a few imaginative scenes and a welcome return from the Loony Tunes gang, Space Jam: A New Legacy suffers badly from Jame's poor screen presence/acting ability and an inability to find its own identity amongst its endless procession of nods and winks to other properties and brand names.2 cases of mistaken identity out of 5.",

This movie is literally probably good for kids under 5 years old who laugh at anything and wouldn't notice the horrible acting and hack job they did on the Looney Toons. Not good enough for me to watch it again that's for sure. We watched for free on HBO Max, It's definitely not worth paying theater money for.",

This movie is going to make a lot of serious movie fans angry. Mad Max Fury Road Cameos, Matrix Cameos. Only one good thing I can say about this movie because I wanted this review to be fair. The CGI was great. Some of the best I have seen in a while. But still not worth it.

            "content": "It's a rare occurrence when the kiddos and I aren't on the same page when it comes to movies. It seems as if animation studios have learned to cater to adults as well as children when it comes to kids' movies, and that's a great thing as a parent. But then a movie like Space Jam: A New Legacy comes along which gives parents nothing to grasp on to and makes you feel every minute of its excessively long two-hour running time. As for the kiddos though, they absolutely loved it!In Space Jam: A New Legacy LeBron James basically plays an exaggerated version of himself, treating his two boys like basketball teammates, rather than acting like a father, in a very overbearing and demanding way. Although one of his children likes playing basketball, his youngest Dom (Cedric Joe) would rather stay in his room building video games. LeBron is having none of it and demands that Dom constantly practice as well as attend an upcoming basketball camp. It is then, after a series of strange events, Dom & LeBron get sucked into a computer program run by Al G. Rhythm (Don Cheadle), with their only hope of returning to the real world if LeBron can beat Al G. In a basketball game. It may sound easy, but with James only having Looney Tunes characters as teammates and Al bringing in NBA & WNBA stars on his team, this may be a game that LeBron can't win.THE GOODNot a penny has been spared in making this one of the most colourful, beautifully animated features ever seen on film. Animation has come a long way from 1992's original Space Jam and in this sequel of sorts, all the usual Looney Tunes characters return, but this time, have been given a 3D-style makeover. If only some of that money was spent on producing a decent script!Mr. 10: This film was awesome. I loved seeing all the Looney Tunes characters come to life and seeing Porky Pig rap was my favourite. There were also lots of funny jokes, which was good too.Mr. 7: All the Looney Tunes characters are so silly and it's really funny when they're constantly fighting with each other. I like how they all team up together to play basketball against the bad guys.THE BADWith a script that sounds more like a Public Service Announcement, rather than an entertaining movie, I actually thought I was listening to something that a bunch of sixth-graders had put together rather than a Hollywood movie. While a lot of animated movies may cater to adults this film does not even bother, keeping everything low-brow and very childish from start to finish. I have no problem with this because my kiddos loved it, but what I don't understand however is just why you'd bizarrely put in scenes from The Matrix, Mad Max, and Casablanca. Mr.10 and Mr. 7 were continually leaning over in their chairs asking me what all these strange scenes were. Not only were kids not born when these films were originally released but they're not even in the age range to watch these films NOW!Mr. 10: The only part of the film I didn't like was Al G. Rhythm because he didn't make any sense. Sometimes he's really strong and then sometimes he's really weak. If you run the computer program shouldn't you always be strong?Mr. 7: I didn't like the bad guy because he kept changing the rules so he could win and LeBron would lose. It didn't seem very fair.THE UGLYIf you want to see a film whose main reason to exist is based wholly and solely to market toys to kids, then Space Jam is that film. From start to finish there is always a product brand, toy, or game perfectly positioned on the screen to face the audience with a character on the screen saying something along the lines of \"hey will you pass me that LeBron James branded basketball?\" 'Yes, I can pass you this LeBron James branded basketball'. This may be a slight exaggeration but watch this film and you'll get my drift.I knew that Space Jam: A New Legacy wasn't going to be good but I just didn't expect it to be that bad. From wooden acting (by the human cast) to Looney Tunes characters with voices completely different than the ones I grew up with, this movie was quite the slog to sit through. In saying that though, my kids enjoyed every minute of it and I'm happy to admit that not every film is made for me.TWO AND A HALF LEBRON JAMES BRANDED BASKETBALLS OUT OF FIVEMr.10: This film was awesome. The Looney Tunes characters were really funny and it was great to see them all team up together. Porky Pig was the best. Four and a half out of five.Mr. 7: I liked seeing all the Looney Toon characters turn from cartoon to 3D and they were all really funny. But I didn't like how long the film went for or the bad guy. Four out of five.",

Let me start by saying that the animation - both traditional hand-drawn and CGI - is terrific, as is the integration with live and CGI backgrounds.LeBron James can't act and doesn't come across well as the fictional version of himself. It takes forever for the story to get going - I had a couple of small boys in front of me, hyper with excitement, and Mum took them out after half an hour because the film simply hadn't captured their attention at that point.I didn't dislike the film, but it did a Ready Player One with characters from various WB franchises and, during important sequences, I was concentrating on spotting characters in the audience for the game rather than concentrating on plot.",

But since my 11 year old son wanted to watch it, of course I found the time to go watch it with him.And while my son definitely enjoyed the movie, I must admit that I was not overly thrilled with this 2021 movie from director Malcolm D. Lee. \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\" is definitely a movie for the youngsters.Needless to say that this 2021 movie turned out to be as I had initially expected it would. And \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\" didn't really offer me much of any worthwhile entertainment or enjoyment.Visually then \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\" is definitely spot on, because the animation and art style used here is good and pleasing to the eyes. And there is no secret about the fact that it is the animated cartoon characters that carry the movie singlehandedly. It should be said that there are so many interesting characters and things going on in the background that \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\" could actually be watched twice; the first time for the movie alone, and the second time to take in all the background stuff. There are so many cameo from lots of different movies.Storywise then \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\" wasn't really impressive. And it certainly didn't manage to entertain me in a wholehearted manner. However, it is sort of impressive that six writers could collectively manage to come up with so little. The storyline told in \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\" just failed to captivate me and didn't offer much of any enjoyment or entertainment in comparison to the 1996 \"Space Jam\" movie - which was no masterpiece, but at least it fared better than the 2021 movie.As I mentioned above, then it is the animated cartoon characters that carry the movie, no doubt about it. But even with the likes of Don Cheadle and Sonequa Martin-Green on the cast list, there wasn't much to do. Then there was LeBron James instead of Michael Jordan; and boy that was just horrible to witness because he was fully stripped of anything even remotely to an acting talent.\"Space Jam: A New Legacy\" is a movie for the youngsters, pure and simple, and aside from being nice visually, then there was nothing much to behold here.I am rating \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\" a less than mediocre four out of ten stars.",

Unfortunately that's all folks (for the positives) because this '21 sequel is a bombastic mess, void of anything new and aside from the \"server-verse\" angle, it's not good.The original was never a masterpiece but it was just that - \"original\". The six writers decided not to actually write a movie and instead just copy \"Ready Player One\" by scouring and unloading the entire Warner Bros intellectual property catalogue on the audience to overload the senses and mask how unoriginal, unnecessary and contrived this all is.Lebron James and the cast put in a solid effort with what they've got to work with, especially Don Cheadle as the villain.The trouble with \"A New Legacy\" is that there isn't a story to warrant a sequel, let alone the whopping 115 minute runtime. The original was a swift 87 minutes which served as a celebration of Michael Jordan's return to basketball at the height of his popularity - it was lightning in a bottle!Kids and basketball fans who love LeBron James will surely like this movie. As previously said it looks great. It does hit the funny bone more than once, it has a soundtrack too and for some people that might be enough to call this a good time. If this were original and the first one I'd be more flexible in my rating but it's not. I've seen this movie before - it was better the first time.Bill Murray, you the real MVP!3/10.",

The target audience of then are now young adults. Any adult that finds this entertaining should seek professional help immediately. And even worse, space jam of the 90s went a long way toward bridging race relations. MJ was a hero to my youngest and the main reason why he got interested in basketball but without the genes, it was more passion than personal reward. Still it was funny to watch this little white kid go up and hug a full size posterboard in the mall. Kids from everywhere, who probably knew nothing of basketball and MJ's record, fell in love with the movie and the characters anyway because it was a genuine story, not a marketing gimmick. Will this remake appeal to children, sure. Same as a diet of pop tarts, chips, soda and candy.",

He wants his son Dom to follow in his footsteps even though he is too short to be a basketball player.Dom wants to have fun and be a games designer. LeBron wants to just drill his sons to be the best like him, all work and no play.Al G Rhythm (Don West) is a rogue artificial intelligence program that abducts Dom leaving LeBron and the Warner Brothers cartoon characters playing an epic and upgraded basketball game.The story is for Bugs, Daffy and Co to come on the scene as LeBron tries to get a team together. He was hoping to get Superman and Batman. Instead it's Tweety, Taz and Foghorn Leghorn.It's an exercise on WB using its intellectual property to show Disney that it too has assets. So you have Harry Potter, Hanna Barbera cartoon characters, Justice League to Looney Tunes. Incongruously for a movie aimed at kids. It also has characters from Game of Thrones, It, The Devils and Clockwork Orange.It is frenetic and colourful. I found myself laughing a few times and I watched this movie with low expectations given the bad reviews this movie has had. The film is a little too long and the plot makes little sense.

Though it also takes them awhile to get to the other looney tune characters it's lot of Bugs.

Whatever your feelings are about this character ... he is not included here - and if you actually check how his appearance would have gone down in the movie - you may change your perspective or your feelings about him not being included.But this \"outrage\" of some, who thought the character was deleted because of any backlash that might flush over the movie ... well it seems gone now. People are rather quite sad and mad about the overall outcome of the movie. And I would argue that LeBron is not really to blame for that. His acting abilities are better than those of MJ (and I say that as a big MJ fan).I think one of the biggest problems of the movie is how long it is. And how much \"other stuff\" it tries to push and pack into the movie. So many characters (and yet no Pepe - had to mention him once more for fun) and a 2 hour run time. As expected this looks way better than the original.And it tries to make more sense than the original too. While we had Aliens in the first one, this is closer to home. It also has Don Cheadle ... what a wonderful bad guy. But while it tries to make sense ... it falls flat on its face - no pun intended.The young ones might not mind and hopefully take the message this has (be yourself) and run with it - again no pun intended. The big ones may get a bit annoyed after a while I reckon. Still there are some good jokes in here (half time surprise guest/cameo), but also some really bad word puns/jokes - you may fall for them ... or not.The soundtrack overall is not as great as that of the original. There are some really good/updated/tweaked versions of some classics - like flavor in ya ear.

It didn't need to be 3D. We wanted it to look like the original as much as possible. We didn't get that!This sequel was like if we had ordered Space Jam 1996 from Wish!My favorite sequence was the ending, with all of the WB owned characters making cameos.

            "content": "This movie wasn't going to be good from the start, but somehow it ends up being even worse than the original. We see LeBron James as a kid playing a Gameboy he gets called out by his coach who tells him that he needs to truly apply himself if he wants to succeed. Cut to the present LeBron wants his sons to follow in his footsteps. He pushes them specifically his youngest son Dom. The Problem is Dom is a game designer and doesn't want to play basketball. From that, you know what's the arc and the resolution. How the looney tunes factor in is that while at Warner bros talking about a movie deal LeBron and Dom are under surveillance by the studio self-aware A.i Al-G Rhythm(Don Cheadle) who digitized them into the server verse a universe where all the Warner bros characters exist on different worlds and blah blah Son's kidnapped LeBron meets the toons and all their fate's rest in the hands of a basketball game. LeBron doesn't offer anything outside of his stardom. He is a horrible actor giving terrible line delivery almost as bad as Shaq. I'm not going to lie like most and say Michael's performance was gold material, but Michael was likable. Despite his bland attitude, you could a least enjoy his presence he knew what kind of movie he was in and made the best of it. Regardless of where you stand with LeBron, he's not that he is a Jerk who wants things his way the whole movie. An ass to his Son until the end when he gets the obvious lesson. The Toons are alright just as much as they were in the original but they don't get much screen time before the game. The animation on all of them is good, The 3d design looks great I would've preferred those to a 2d redesign Honestly. The servers are just a big advertisement for Warner. With DCEU posters everywhere, a whole ready player one scenario with all these Studio characters that most casual audiences probably aren't even going to recognize or know. With terrible cosplayer standin on a repeated loop. Overall this is a disaster of a film while it could've offered something with the server verse but the tired message, The product placement combined with LeBron's acting makes this a sleeper to get into the end with very few jokes that worked this film can be forgotten* Spoiler/Plotholes* starts the basketball game starts too soon and last too long like 40 minutes. It's not even really a basketball game as opposed to a video game version of dom's creation. I guess also the first movie doesn't exist in this continuation because the toons live in a server not the center of the earth. They have no memory of Michael but they make jokes about him. Even the Nerdlucks show up. The defeat of Al G Rhythm has no repercussions he's supposed to be the algorithm for the studio servers and controls the whole server verse wouldn't his death destroy the servers and all the characters? The whole bugs death is pointless, he's fine and how did he get into the human world?",

Lebron James steps in to take over the basketball all-star role this time around, and he's honestly pretty corny, but fine all in all. James 'character' in the film is just so thinly written to make way for the film story, ultimately weighing down what could have been another fun adventure with a different star. James is hardly the films biggest problem though, and out of all of it, I oddly have to name Don Cheadle as the worst thing about this film. Not only is his character a poorly written and constructed device (that's also kinda a perfect metaphor for Warner Bros oddly) but his over the top performance and wooden delivery make for honestly one of the worst villains i've ever seen on screen. The film is thankfully entertaining, although it can be kinda cringeworthy to watch at times. They try really hard to appeal to the kids of this generation, and it is so incredibly forced that it can honestly be quite hard to watch. I enjoyed seeing all my favorite tunes again, but the CGI overkill in the second half of the film is a bit too much to bare- and honestly just feels like one huge commercial. Yes, there are commercial elements in the films first half, but I felt like it still had some heart and tue humor to it- it wasn't trying too hard or shoving products in our face. In the end, the film had a few funny moments, and didn't bore me (as some may say it did) but it's far too shallow to be a decent film- and far too forced to gain any sympathy.My Rating: 4.4/10.",

The execution of this story is a strangely contrived adventure where the antagonist traps both LeBron and his son in a virtual world for very thinly defined reasons. That's the main problem of this film - the character motivations and plot conflicts seem very thin, as if the screenplay were unfinished. For example, the backstory of the Looney Tunes characters leaving their world for other movie worlds was badly explained and I was still wondering why they were scattered and why they decided to come back. The skits on the other movie worlds were neat individually, but they didn't add up to much. The thin plotting and aimless animated sketches are a flaw shared by this film's predecessor, despite what the nostalgists may claim, but this time it's too chaotic to be fun and the plot was muddled up.",

            "content": "I'll be honest right off the bat and say that I've only seen the original Space Jam a total of two times. I find it to be mildly enjoyable, but it wasn't a film I ever latched onto. The nostalgia of the 90s is all over it and that's what makes it entertaining to this day, but I still don't think it's great. When I heard they would be making a very loose sequel and Lebron James wasn't going to be filling the shoes that Michael Jordan left, I was intrigued. With the technology today, this concept could be big and fun. Well, Space Jam: A New Legacy definitely had its moments, but it's ultimately just the same concept all over again. Here's why, unless you're showing it to your kids, it's really not that special.Here's the premise in a nutshell. Lebron James is having issues connecting with his son Dom and has nothing in mind for him but that he wants to make him a basketball star just like himself. After stumbling across a room on the Warner Bros. Lot, Lebron and his son are sucked into what the film calls the \"server-verse\". This is where all the worlds from the movies Warner Bros. Have ever made all exist. Being sent to the land of Looney Tunes by Al G. Rhythm, who runs the so-called \"server-verse\" and has challenged Lebron to a basketball game in exchange for his freedom, comes across Bugs Bunny. Bugs then helps Lebron assemble the rest of the \"Tune Squad\" and the second half of the movie is basically the basketball game.Other than some incredibly impressive visuals and a fun soundtrack, there really isn't much substance here. It's really just a story of a father winning the love back from his son. For that, this film is not that engaging and the screenplay is very, very standard as well. The final act of the film goes on way too long and it just felt like a massive commercial for Warner Bros. As a company. At least all their famous movies are good and have memorable characters, right?As far as the positives go, Don Cheadle as Al G. Rhythm completely held the movie together for me. His over-the-top and campy performance made me smile and he's in a lot more of the movie than I expected. I also really enjoyed the portion of the film where Lebron became a cartoon character with the rest of the Looney Tunes. That aspect was not a part of the original film and I found that to be a very nice addition. Other than that though, Space Jam: A New Legacy really doesn't have anything that suggests it needed to be made.In the end, the life lessons for kids throughout this film have all been done better in other family films. The aspect of meshing Looney Tunes with live-action Basketball still kind of has its charm, but again, the movie just feels like a giant corporate commercial. Lebron James is fine in the movie because he's in his element, but he's not the best actor overall. I smiled a few times and loved a cameo that occurs in the latter half of the film, but it wasn't enough to warrant a recommendation from me. It's just not that good of a movie. If you're a fan of the original, I'm sure you'll find moments to enjoy here, but it ultimately feels like a tired premise when looking back.",

            "content": "The original 'Space Jam' wasn't a good movie at all but it benefits from being the time capsule movie of the 90's. The color palette, the pop culture references, the product placements and Jordan cement it as a classic, an undeserved classic but a classic nonetheless. 'Space Jam: A New Legacy' pretends the original never existed, a fatal flaw. The prime selling point of the picture is nostalgia. It doesn't do LeBron James any favors pretending that he isn't in the shadow of Michael Jordan. It's debatable who the better basketball star is but 'Space Jam' is Jordan's.We live in a nostalgic age. We're constantly revisiting 90's IPs and I don't have a problem with that. The only thing relevant to the original is the title. It's a shame too because I think a lot of humor could have been generated by being Meta about the comparisons between James and Jordan and why there needed to be a new 'Space Jam'.LeBron James is the star of the film. I know that he is reviled as much as he is loved and brings a lot of baggage with him. I think a lot of the hate he has received is totally unfounded but 'Space Jam' too isn't going to help his reputation. Jordan wasn't Brando but he looks like it in comparison to James who is awkward and wooden. It doesn't help that the moral of the story about being yourself is so heavy handed and LeBron doesn't stop hammering it in. I'm sure this isn't the case but he looks like an egotist because there is no selfparody or sense of humor to his performance. He spends a great deal of his screen time lecturing the Looney Tunes. I'm sorry but not only is this going to strike out with the millennial but the kids are going to hate it too.The set up to the ball game is overly complicated and Don Cheadle's villain is given no reason to hate James or exist. We just see Warner products everywhere. I don't mind this in theory as a few of the film's only laughs come from revisiting these properties. They don't join the game or comment on it though. They just are there for you to pause it and gawk at them.They needed to bring back Jordan. The movie doesn't work without him. It could have been the perfect opportunity for the two NBA legends to celebrate both their achievements and show they had a sense of humor. Instead this is probably LeBron's biggest disaster since 'The Decision' while Jordan's legend grows with 'The Last Dance'",

Once again, an NBA legend enters a netherworld populated by imaginary characters who must assist him in winning a basketball game in order to escape. This time, the villain is Don Cheadle's Al-G Rhythm.The digital collection of Warner Bros. Allows Malcolm D. Lee to expand the playground to include Superman, King Kong, Voldemort, and others. There's a terrific scene in which LeBron and Bugs round up the rest of the Tune Squad. In keeping with the times, the character of Lola Bunny has been thankfully desexualized in this sequel. \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\" is a passable family film. LeBron James' arc is to rediscover the joy of the game with the help of his anarchistic colleagues. Unlike Michael Jordan, he lets his inherent LeBron-ness become the punchline.",

            "content": "I watched the original live-action cartoon hybrid twice at the cinema when I was a kid, and many times after on video, it was always rumoured there would be a sequel, and it came twenty-five years later, directed by Malcolm D. Lee (Scary Movie 5, Girls Trip). Basically, basketball player LeBron James (as himself, Razzie winner) wishes for both of his sons, Darius (Ceyair J. Wright) and Dom (Cedric Joe), to follow in his footsteps. But Dom, a child prodigy in computer software, instead dreams of becoming a video game developer. LeBron shows an interest in the arcade basketball game Dom has developed, but a glitch from a certain move causes his character to be deleted, which crushes Dom. Meanwhile, at Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank, state-of-the-art A. I., Al-G Rhythm (Don Cheadle) has secretly become self-aware and desires more recognition from the world. LeBron is invited to the studio to discuss a movie deal, taking Dom with him. While LeBron dismisses the idea, Dom shows an interest in the studio's software. Dom expresses his interest in software development, leading to a blow-up argument with his father at basketball camp when LeBron refuses to let him give up on the sport. Al-G lures the father and son to the studio basement and traps them in virtual reality. Insulted by LeBron's refusal to recognise his potential, Al-G takes Dom as his prisoner, and tells LeBron his son will only be released if the basketball star assembles a team together to beat him in a game of basketball. LeBron is then transported through the virtual space where he is dumped in Tune World. LeBron finds the animated world is deserted, with only cartoon character Bugs Bunny (Jeff Bergman) remaining. Bugs explains that Al-G persuaded the rest of the Looney Tunes to leave their world and explore other realities. Meanwhile, Al-G manipulates Dom to turn him against his father and helping him to develop and upgrade himself and his game, which he secretly intends to use against LeBron. Bugs wanting to help LeBron form his basketball team lures Marvin the Martian (Eric Bauza) to landing his spaceship in Tune World and he and LeBron steal the ship to travel to different worlds based on Warner Bros properties. In DC Comics, they find Daffy Duck (Bauza) and Porky Pig (Bauza) trying to be superheroes. In Mad Max: Fury Road, they find Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote. In Austin Powers, they find Elmer Fudd (Bauza) and Sylvester the Cat (Bergman), and Tweety Pie (Bob Bergen) when Sylvester spits him out. In Casablanca, they find Yosemite Sam (Bergman) playing \"As Time Goes By\". In Game of Thrones, they find Foghorn Leghorn (Bauza) riding a dragon. In The Matrix, they find Granny (Candi Milo) and Speedy Gonzales (Gabriel Iglesias). LeBron is unconvinced by the playing capabilities of the Looney Tunes; he insists they find a character with genuine talent. Finally, back in DC Comics, Lola Bunny (Zendaya) is with Wonder Woman (Rosario Dawson) to prove herself as an Amazonian, but Bugs convinces her to join the team to save LeBron's son. LeBron ignores the objections of Bugs and insists on coaching the \"Tune Squad\" on the fundamentals of basketball. When the time for the game arrives, the Tune Squad meet with Al-G's team, the Goon Squad, consisting of upgraded avatars of several active professional basketball players with superpowers and led by Dom. The Looney Tunes are surprised when they find themselves also upgraded, to become computer-animated beings, with more realistic features. To further the stakes, Al-G livestreams the game and abducts countless viewers, including LeBron's family, into the virtual reality while summoning all the Warner Bros. Characters to watch the game. Al-G announces that if the Tune Squad loses, all viewers will remain trapped in the \"server-verse\" for eternity and the Looney Tunes will be deleted permanently. With Dom Ball being a video game, LeBron and his team must contend with scoring high bonus points for style and execution, and the superpowers of the Goon Squad easily dominate the first half of the game. During the break, Sylvester attempts to recruit former Tune Squad member Michael Jordan, but finds actor Michael B. Jordan instead. LeBron realises that traditional basketball skills will not be enough and allows Bugs to devise the strategy for the second half using their cartoon physics to catch up with the Goon Squad. The Tunes manage to regain points until the teams are close to tying. LeBron confronts Dom and tells him he no longer wants to stand in the way of his dream. Dom forgives and trusts his father, and he abandons the Goon Squad. Al-G assumes control of the Goon Squad and uses his own abilities to make them seemingly unbeatable. Dom realises the only way to win the game is to use the glitch move, even though whoever does so will be deleted. During the final seconds of the game, Bugs sacrifices himself by performing the move, helping LeBron score the final point, winning the game and causing Al-G and the Goon Squad to be deleted. The James family and the abducted citizens are returned to the real world, while the Tunes gather around Bugs as he bids farewell before disappearing. In the real world, LeBron becomes closer to his family and supports Dom's decision to become a video game designer. After dropping Dom off at a video game trade event, LeBron is delighted when Bugs appears, he can't really \"die\", being a fictional character. He asks LeBron to put him up for a little while until he can find a way back to Tune World. Also starring Sonequa Martin-Green as Kamiyah James, LeBron's wife, Khris Davis as Malik, Harper Leigh Alexander as Xosha James, Xosha Roquemore as Shanice James, Stephen Kankole as Young LeBron, Gerald 'Slink' Johnson as Warner Bros. Security Guard (as Slink Johnson), Sarah Silverman as Warner Bros. Executive, Minari's Steven Yeun as Warner Bros. Executive, Ernie Johnson as Game Announcer, and Get Out's Lil Rel Howery as Game Announcer, with the voices of Jeff Bergman as Fred Flintstone and Yogi Bear, Fred Tatasciore as Taz the Tasmanian Devil, and Justin Roiland as Rick and Morty. Other Warner Bros. Movies and TV references and characters that can be spotted included: King Kong, The Wizard of Oz, The Flintstones, Yogi Bear, The Jetsons, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?, Batman (1966), Wacky Races, Scooby Doo, Where Are You!, A Clockwork Orange, Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels, Superman (1978), The Shining, Gremlins, Thundercats, The Goonies, Batman (1989), Batman Returns, A League of Their Own, Batman: The Animated Series, Animaniacs, The Mask, Superman: The Animated Series, Mars Attacks!, Batman & Robin, Men in Black, The Iron Giant, Harry Potter and the Wizarding World, The Lord of the Rings, Ben 10, 300, The Conjuring, Dunkirk, It (Pennywise), Aquaman, and Joker (2019). James is likeable enough, Cheadle relishes being the villain, and of course Bugs Bunny and his cartoon friends are delightful. I was hoping for something entertaining, but it does not have quite the same charm as the original. The biggest problem is, it tries too hard to be clever, it is not all that funny, it tries too hard to imitate the wonder of Ready Player One cramming as many references as possible from Warner Bros. Properties, almost forgetting the Looney Tunes, and is much more style over substance. There is not a bad word to say about the animation, going from traditional hand-drawn to fantastic special CGI effects to make Bugs fluffy and so on, and any geek watching will have fun spotting the movie and TV characters. It is unfortunate that it is a bit of a let-down, a disappointing but not completely terrible part-animated fantasy sports comedy. Wacky Races was number 100, Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels was number 90, Yogi Bear was number 80, Foghorn Leghorn was number 61, Thundercats was number 54, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! Was number 49, Road Runner was number 48, The Sylvester and Tweety Show was number 35, Daffy Duck was number 30, Looney Tunes / Merrie Melodies was number 20, The Iron Giant was number 12, The Flintstones was number 11, and Bugs Bunny was number 10 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. It won the Razzies for Worst Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel, and Worst Screen Couple for LeBron James and any Warner cartoon character or Time-Warner product he dribbles on, and it was nominated for Worst Picture.

            "content": "I don't have much good to say about this film, so let me start with the bad. Space Jam: A New Legacy, feels like a bad rip off of Spy Kids 3: Game Over. The concept is fun, but very formulaic, while not being totally cohesive or consistent. Id be lying if I said the film doesn't have heart and creativity, but it's severely overshadowed by the corniness, and the plot being all over the place. Space Jam: A New Legacy has countless cliches, and easter eggs, where it gets super distracting. I expected a few fan service moments, but it seemed like this whole film was catered to that, leaving it to run thin. Malcolm D. Lee knew what they were going for, being a simple, and silly film, so you cannot take this serious at all. Lee did his best to embrace his goal, but he over-did it, creating way too many cringey moments.I can totally see why Lebron James is a basketball player, because he cannot act. Maybe it was the way his lines were written; he just seemed uncomfortable, and not genuine at all, which is one of the biggest dampers of the film, considering this was more of a \"lebron james\" film, over a Space Jam film. The Looney Tunes served their purpose for the most part, but they felt more like a side attractions to Lebron.Although I have a lot that I didn't like about this film, there were a couple of qualities that made it somewhat enjoyable. Even though the Looney Tunes were mainly side characters, it's always a pleasant treat to see them on screen, doing their thing. The cinematography and animations were done fairly well. Everything was very bright, and clear, being visually pleasing. With the film totaling almost two hours, it definitely overstays it's welcome, but it does have a good pace, keeping me engaged almost the whole time.Overall, this was mainly just a nostalgic grab! It was definitely made for the younger viewers, and I believe if you go into this film with an open mind, some of the older crowds could enjoy it for nostalgic purposes.",

So I went to see the film for myself, and my expectations were pretty low for this film. However when I saw in on HBO Max, it was still pretty bad, but it did have some good elements to it. My least favorite part of the film was the first 30 minutes. During that time, it seemed less like a movie and more of a commercial for HBO Max and WB. It was pretty boring, and almost served nothing to the film. LeBron James isn't a very good actor, and how he says his dialogue is very still. The next 30 minutes do get kind of better, but still not very better. IT still felt like a commercial, but at least it was fun seeing LeBron and Bugs recruiting the Looney Tunes Gang. The Wonder Woman one was just stretched out too long. The moments with Al G. Rhythm and Dom were dull. Even the Basketball game was annoying because the stakes were really low and just random. In the second half of the game, we finally see the Looney Tunes in their true form ( aside from Porky Pig rapping). And in the 2nd half of the game, it was pretty fun to see how the Basketball game played out. The story and characters were all pretty bad. But the animation and the visuals were stunning. The reason this has 4 stars and not 1 or 2 is because of the great visuals and solid animation for the Looney Tunes, both in 2d and in CGI. In all, it's a long, HBO Max commercial with a dull story, low stakes, and bad comedy. The animation and visuals are stunning, and some of the basketball game was fun. It may have some fun parts, but it would've worked better as a commercial for HBO Max.",

No original message, nothing.Now, this is more a movie for Americans, i guess, because i have no idea who the protagonist is. Possibly a basketball celebrity like the last one? (that Micheal Jorden at least was known internationally) - anyway, never heard of him.But even unknown actors might do good movies of course - so lets look at the storytelling. A flash of loosely connected scenes that portrait Warner Bros pop culture property - or in short .. a movie length advertisement for WB - how .. erm .. subtle.I can only hope the movie hit the nail in the USA - because it certainly missed it BIG time here in Iceland. Its references simply do not hit the mark at all, its protagonist is unknown and the toons seem not to adhere to the established personalities that they had in the shorts.All in all - a terrible waste of time - that does not satisfy nostalgic adults, nor teens/children at all.",

The looney tunes take a massive backseat, which is the biggest mistake this movie makes. The personal human story is not what we came here for, and it's cringe. It's basically WB flexing itself and giving you a big advertisement of their streaming service HBO MAX and all their major properties but whereas before, the core idea was having fun, here, it's all corporate first. Just goes to show how much the pop-culture landscape has changed in these 25 years. Also, HBO and WB, you ain't doing any favours for yourself by reminding us of Game of Thrones.Sure, there were some moments and some scenes, no matter how short relative to the entire runtime, that were fun, I'm not gonna lie. It wasn't all bad. That one Michael Jordan joke was the best part, I laughed out loud. But stuff like that was so few and far between, it pissed me off why they didn't let the writers and the animators etc just go full ham like that. You'd still get your marketing and advertising but instead of being bland and boring, it would have been so much fun.Anyway, I'd recommend watching the old one again. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 3.5/10.P. S The 3D looney tunes were the stuff of nightmares. NO.",

Just forget this film ever existed and go and watch the original. It's 25-years-old and is still far more fresh and gripping than this drivel, it actually had focus on the Looney Tunes as opposed to the ball-bouncing protagonist; and the story was far more entertaining.",

I wasn't mad at the concept of traveling around Warner Bros films. At least they were overt in plugging their stuff rather than slipping product placements throughout and thinking we all won't notice.

The answer seems to have been to set him up in the same theatrical vehicle, and allow him to prove to the world that he too, \"Can Be Like Mike!\"Sadly, if that was the goal, it failed as miserably as the movie itself did.It seems as if the production team knew it would end that way, and so little effort was made to do anything other than put a movie on record and show it in theaters. Any effort at quality scripting, good production, solid directing, and getting the most out of the casting, seemed put aside, so that the resulting failure would at least have consumed very little hard work and ingenuity.The result was hammered in the press, and is one of the few times the critics got it right to lampoon a movie.",

In retrospect, it's probably a 6/10.I tried to watch The New Legacy with the same perspective and realized that it's even better than the original because it has more heart, better acting, and the artstyle and special effects are second to none. The cartoon segment has one of the best animations I've ever seen. Mind you, I've watched in 4k on a 65\" inch TV.Although it is a kid's movie, it does have an underlying respectable message for parents. Especially African American dads, the importance of being present but not overbearing, to hug your kids, and to say \"I love you.\"Lebron's acting needs some work, but it's better than I expected. If he is patient enough by accepting small roles, he could develop into an action star.Don Cheadle, Mr. Kung Fu Kenny himself, is back on his BS, did a good job for the most part of the movie, BUT, I'd personally prefer Kevin Hart, Samuel Jackson, Andy Serkis, or Johnny Depp since they are also known for goofy and eclectic characters.P.s.: I had to overrate the movie a bit due to the haters giving it 1/10.

No, the plot isnt one of great twist, amazing originality, and amazing character development - But it didnt need to be. What the movie does well, is implementing good references and jokes without them feeling forced. Especially as somebody who watched basketball, i really found myself enjoying all the easter eggs during the game. Keeping me entertained and maintaining my focus.There is alot the movie does poorly how ever, but overall, im satisfied, i didnt expect them to reinvent the wheel, nor blow me away, but i was entertained and can see myself watching this movie again down the line.

Rhythm, (really? That's his name) feels like he forces the start of the movie by choosing LeBron to be the center of this WB collaberation. But why? What makes LeBron so special that it warrants this? Because he knows how to dunk a ball?Now the first movie had a ridiculous villain too but at least it made sense to me as to why he was going after the toons.The movie is your basic \"parent doesn't understand child\" cliche story in every kids movie. It isn't bad but it is hard to like the kid when he doesn't see he is obviously being manipulated.Speaking of manipulative. Bugs Bunny, while I understand he is the original troll of the cartoon universe, tricks LeBron into recruiting the toons when he already had people he wanted to recruit. Bugs basically said \"oh your kids in danger? Well forget that I gotta get mah buddies back.\"Next are the references which makes me ask, \"who is this movie for?\" Kids? Adults? Furries? I don't know, because while it looks like it is for kids, it has references to movies and shows that they are either too young to recognize and too you to still watch to this day.If you have a kid or are a kid you'll enjoy it but this will not age as well as the original did in my book.The original cost $80 million to make and made back 3 times as much. This movie cost $162 million and I doubt it will even see half of that. This is a flop.",

            "content": "Space Jam: A New Legacy is a sequel 25 years too late. Trying to bring back the nostalgia and success of the 1996 original, this new one lacks the charm and charisma of the original. In the end, this one feels desperate on throwing so much crap at the wall to see if something lands and sticks, and it lacks the heart and ambition making it a big cashgrab without direction.That being said, I don't think it has zero merit. When the Looney Tunes Classic 2D Animation sequence of the film comes up, it looks pretty good and has a bit of fun with what it does with slapstick humour and references. There are Warner Bros. References to franchises everywhere, which makes it feel like Ready Player One, so at first it's kind of cool but then you realise it's going to throw this at you non-stop and starts to get tedious. Little glimpses of humour are okay and the voice actors do a good job with the characters.All the live-action/human actor sequences however are really bad. To be fair, Michael Jordan was kind of bad too, but he had more depth to him than LeBron James did and was acting at cartoon sequences to nothing. Don Cheadle is really the only actor seemingly having a blast with it. Everybody else acts poorly and there's not really a Bill Murray or Wayne Knight equivalent here to add in some good banter. I didn't buy the kid was a computer genius either, not helped by poor acting.Its Soundtrack was lacking here too. It's one of the very best things going for the original Space Jam and fitted well with the themes and style of the film. Here there's nothing memorable and just seems generic and forgettable. The film relies mostly on CGI visuals and by the end becomes complete and utter nonsense of going too far off the rails for my liking personally, especially with no firm rules.In the end, it wasn't the worst watch in the whole wide world, but it felt like it was trying too hard and lacked what made the original Space Jam appealing and become a Guilty Pleasure. Yes it was nice to see the Looney Tunes again, but this is not the great big comeback for them and all the money in the world and cameos in it don't mean alot if the film isn't hitting the right notes for new and nostalgic fans.4.5/10.",

Guess what the original has a Rotten Tomatoes score of forty-four percent. \"But this movie is just a commercial for Warner Brothers.\"Need I remind you that people said the exact same thing about the first Space Jam. Doug Walker (in character as The Nostalgia Critic) complained that it was just a commercial for Nike. It's a critique with which I disagree but it was never an uncommon one. This movie was bombarded with the exact same critiques that the first one was when it first came out.\"But what about the pop culture references?\"\nThe first Space Jam also had those \"I didn't know Dan Aykroyd was in this picture\".It's exhausting to have to go through all the illegitimate critiques before you get to the legitimate ones.My biggest worry when I saw this film was that it would be a blind rehash of the original. It wasn't. Instead of being about Basketball it was about video games (albeit sports influenced ones). Instead of having themes about standing up for yourself it has themes about trying to bend others to your will.Bugs Bunny has a great moment towards in the end of the film and I love what they've done with Lola as a character. The humour was genuinely funny and I for one enjoyed the Easter Eggs to every Warner Bros movie ever.The Algorithm's plot to force Lebron to play against his son in apocalyptic Basketball actually was clever in its cruelty. And I do think the characters are well-acted. And to keep this a Spoiler free review I'll just say if you're paying attention it wasn't a Deus Ex Machina. (I can't give more details).What did I not like about this. I don't love the transformation of the Looney Tunes from cartoons to live action though to the movie's credit neither do they. And the early part of the film spent too much time trying to advertise Lebron James (where the original didn't with Michael Jordan). The Algorithm could have had a more fleshed out motive but Cheadle played it well enough that I don't care.When the merits of this are measured against this first, I like the first better. But I still greatly enjoyed this film and find the attacks against it unfair.Space Jam 2 is good. Deal with it.",

Rhythm.They barely used the extraordinarily talented Steven Yeun (who played a Warner Bros. Exec). Malik (played by Khris Davis) was so funny but, sigh, under-used. I half-expected him to be 'teleported' into the cartoon-court and give us some fine LoonyTunes-inspired hilarity. But he was 'benched' throughout.Sadly, all the characters came across as 'inadequate' within the confines of this particularly ludicrous script.I think the filmmakers were trying to strike the perfect balance between the original 1996 \"Space Jam\" and the 1988 \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" film. Whereas those two excelled, \"Space Jam\" 2021 - more like 'Space Ham', and I'm not looking at you, Porky Pig - turned out to be an epic train-wreck.I sincerely pray they do not show a screening of this movie to Bugs Bunny and the rest of the Loony Tunes gang. The 'Tune Squad' will just freak their freak! Some of them will seriously wonder what encouraged the animation artists to make them look and move the way they did in 3D. Even Tweety might have been urged to use a few censor-worthy words after seeing the 'final out'.Over the years, I have enjoyed Basketball - I am not a diehard fan but am familiar with the game's various elements. Many a friend and cousin of mine have actually played Basketball at an official level. I take this time to hope and pray that these friends and cousins do not end up choosing to see this movie over the weekend.I have a feeling that even some sports-gamers won't appreciate some of the elements they integrated into this film, which felt like a strange unappealing version of 'Fantasy Football', only with Basketball and upended beyond belief.The voice-casting for each of the 'Tunes' was great. The references to various WB IPs was brilliant. The characters' full-cartoon designs were superb compared to their frightfully inferior photorealistic (almost) 3D-CG counterparts.The 'classic cartoon' scenes were literally the only ones in this film I enjoyed watching. The nostalgia I felt there should have carried over into the rest of the movie, in keeping with the excellence of the 1996 original. Alas, that wasn't the case with \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\".The whole 'teleport everyone who tunes into the live-stream' part was overkill. After a while, every real person in the digital realm seemed to have forgotten their perilous circumstance, and were happy cheering the teams on (!).I wish they didn't transform the Tunes into those semi-realistic 3D renditions. That was the whole charm behind \"Roger Rabbit\" and the original \"Space Jam\". They should have kept the toons looking toony and merged them with the 'real world'.Only the 'Goon Squad' got a worthy 'upgrade' in this re-design, and even then they didn't come close to touching the presence and intimidation value that the original 'Monstars' brought to court in the 1996 version. Oh, and they gave the Monstars' tiny versions a few seconds of screen time by way of cameos.I was enjoying all the 'WB easter eggs' they included in the audience more than the game itself. However, they all looked like real-world cosplayers who were 'teleported' into the game. Even King Kong seemed confused about the whole thing, and I don't blame him.The kid Dom James (Played by Cedric Joe) seemed completely oblivious to the Matrix-level implausibility of the situation, let alone his father's more than reasonable concerns about Al G's ambitions. It was literally fun and games to Dom, when all he had to do to cease Al's 'reign' was stop playing ball.He did in the end, late as it was. I could practically see the big red 'convenience-button' glowing and a lazy screenplay writer smacking it with hypnotic glee while another one pulled down on the 'predictable-lever'.Don't even get me started on that major Jordan-cameo let-down. It quite frankly broke my heart.There is not much good to say about the sheer 'Loony' atrocities, and predictabilities, that have been committed in this highly anticipated sequel. The movie defied credibility, and not at all in the exceptional way the original 1996 film did. I ended up highly anticipating the movie to finish so I could begin the arduous task of writing this painfully truthful review before attempting to heal myself from the Toony-trauma of it all.The legendary Warner Bros. Studios (!) worked on this supposed-to-be-brilliant sequel, and not a one among them stopped to suggest, \"Hey, we can do better, way better.\" In the 'Age of Streaming' where all sorts of IPs and Studios (even WB, for that matter!) are upping their game, this crew decided to go low. The final result? A grand slam dump in lieu of a dunk.I don't think I will ever forgive them for what they tried doing to my all-time toon-hero Bugs Bunny. If something untoward had happened there, there'd have been hell to pay.\"That's all folks!\" Wait, let me rephrase that... \"That's it, folks, I've had it!\"",

            "content": "Ohh boy. I just saw Space Jam: A New Legacy. My head is still spinning from what I just saw. Granted, the first wasn't a Oscar winning piece, but it was watchable and exciting.We open up with LeBron as a child, more interested in his GameBoy. Coach takes his video games away as it isn't helping and say's basketball will help your mother.Mr James ( or King James, uggh as he is called over and over)asks his son, who is developing a video game, if he wants to tag along.to the Warner Brothers lot to listen in on a supposed project. At this time, we meet Don Cheadle's character inside the computer (yes, it is really that confusing.)Don Cheadle wants to play a basketball game. If you win, you are free, I win, you stay with me in here forever. So, James and Bugs Bunny go on a search to find the Loony Tunes characters.That is the movie. Assembling the \"team\" then playing a game. The movie is chocked full of every single Warner Media character. It got to a point where it was super frustrating seeing so much brand product placement. Sure, Disney does Hidden Mickey's, but that is less subtle. Seeing It the clown and The Mask were too distracting in the crowd. In fact, there was an overly long, awkward Austin Powers bit which did not fit except being owned by Warner.. At one point, I figured I'm watching a giant ad for HBO Max.One more thing that annoyed me, Lebron can not act! I wanted to leave, but I forced myself to watch this. Couldn't Warner Media have picked a NBA star who can well, act?",

He was my favorite character. I know that if you are a liberal that you don't have a sense of humor, I get that. I know that if you are a liberal that you have to be told when to laugh. But if you can't see the funny in a smelly skunk who wants to get in close with hugs and kiss', maybe cartoons are not for you. Maybe instead of getting a cartoon cancelled, you should try to figure out how you are going to move out of your mothers basement.And then they cast LeBron Lames as the lead? Lames is the main reason I missed this movie. Putting money in LeBron Lames pocket is the same as putting money in Communist China's pocket. I refuse to support a Communist loving, police-officer-hating, ignorant-race-bating-bigot, like LeBron. And judging from the reviews and response this film has generated, everyone else feels the same.There is a reason that Michael Jordan is the GOAT. Not only did Michael revolutionize the game of basketball but he also revolutionized the icon status. The reason Michael was so great, was because he was just as good off the court as he was on the court; Meaning he had class.",

I'm not a Lebron fan on the court but off the court he's great. The new Toon Squad jerseys/unis are outstanding and I was entertained from start to the finish. I won't spoil it here but the movie even had a moment where I got chills. All I'm going to say about that.This is not the place to show your hate for Lebron or debate the Lebron/MJ GOAT status. Just enjoy the movie for what it is. Having said all of that what's missing is a soundtrack like the original or even a hit song but long gone are those days of movies producing chart topping songs let alone soundtracks.",

            "content": "I can see why some people actually like this movie knowing how hyped up it was in the trailer with the cameos and action-packed elements this film wanted to provide. But I genuinely cannot like this movie. The first Space Jam didn't rub in this much of a cash grab like the sequel does. Space Jam, like many people have said, is basically a good movie because of how it was produced for its time when basketball was popular and animated commercials were always worth watching since they were very creative with what they would come up with in the making of them. Space Jam was definitely not a perfect movie, the only thing oscar-worthy was honestly the animation, but I still liked it for what it was from its time. But this sequel didn't need to happen. Instead of Michael Jordan we have Lebron James in the clich\u00e9 father and son bonding plot which actually would've worked okay atleast with this movie if this was the only flaw. But this movie makes Lebron unlikable to his son manipulating him to be an athlete instead of what he wants to be which is a video game creator. Which is annoying to the audience. Michael Jordan never appears in this film which would've been forgivable if this movie was atleast okay. But since MJ told WB he didn't want to, WB hypes us up with Michael B Jordan in this movie instead, some people find it funny but I find it disgusting to anyone who wanted to see MJ. Atleast don't talk about him at all if he doesn't want to be in the film, seriously. We're focusing on someone else this time. The villain Al-G, who is also a live action character, is cringeworthy who plans to make the world his own game. The acting is noticeably bad unlike the first film. Lebron isn't just too chill, he's usually too awkward at times and so are many of the other live-action characters involved in the story. And this is a common problem with live-action animation hybrids but here it's a lot more noticeable since the Looney Tunes don't appear until later. And of course speaking of the Looney Tunes, even the Looney Tunes are a problem. Yes, I'm not kidding. The stupid controversy desexualizing Lola Bunny is honestly a sexist thing to do with a character. Compare Lola Bunny to Jessica Rabbit from Who Framed Roger Rabbit atleast, Lola wasn't even sexualized in the first place. But anyway, most of the Looney Tunes hardly get any roles. It's mostly Bugs Bunny and sometimes Daffy, Granny, and Sylvester. Pepe Le Pew was not even in this movie at all because of another dumb controversy about him sexually harassing women. This is the Looney Tunes like what do you expect? They were from a time when cartoons got away with a lot of things that wouldn't be allowed in cartoons nowadays. In the first Space Jam he was just teaming up in the basketball tournament like there wasn't even a joke about him chasing Penelope Pussycat who doesn't like him. And the animation is also problematic. Not only is the CGI too furry and realistic on the Looney Tunes but the idea of it makes no sense. They enter the live-action world hand-drawn but are \"turned into\" CGI and will be released back to 2D if they win the game, like what sense does this make? I mean yeah the CGI looks unsettling but still, this doesn't work. And even though this movie brings back traditional animation as well, the traditional animation in the first film did an outstanding job with the Looney Tunes, here it's noticeably downgraded, overly saturated, and less fluid as if Warner Brothers didn't make the budget. The only animation I was fine with was the robot that helped Al-G Rhythm. The only thing I can really like from the Looney Tunes is the voice acting (except for Lola) and maybe a few creative jokes in the Looney Tunes world that actually feel like the Looney Tunes. And no I am not talking about the Big Chungus joke where he apparently becomes canon. And of course, the cameos in this movie are all a lie. They all stay way back in the game's crowd blurred away doing nothing but spectating. And the movie's soundtrack is just too cheesy with constant rap and pop songs. This sequel was truly a mistake, I'm sorry.",

Even though that film doesn't hold as well now, it's still much better than Space Jam: A New Legacy.Space Jam: A New Legacy follows LeBron James as he works with the Looney Tunes to win a basketball game in order to save his son from a rogue artificial intelligence.Looking back at Space Jam now, it's not very good but there is a certain charm that film possesses and a level of nostalgia for me which makes it a guilty pleasure. However, I found no joy watching Space Jam: A New Legacy. I was interested purely because of nostalgia but this film disappointed me on so many levels. It doesn't even feel like a film. It's more of a 2 hour advertisement for all the properties Warner Bros own. We're taken through franchises like The Matrix, Austin Powers, the DC universe and many more throughout. It felt like a cheap way to promote and sell their properties. Even the audience of the basketball match is made up of characters Warner Bros own. The huge amount of characters and references were so distracting and took away my focus on the actual game. The story of the original Space Jam was very cheesy and predictable but it came from a time where it was more acceptable. Here, the premise is so outdated and predictable all the way through. Aside from one, every single joke fell flat. The only aspect of Space Jam: A New Legacy that I thought was well done were the effects. Clearly a lot of effort went into them and the film indeed looks great.The performances are also pretty awful. Michael Jordan's performance in the original was not good and the same goes for LeBron James. This film revolves around him more than the Looney Tunes themselves but James isn't able to carry this film. He is very wooden especially during scenes that require him to show emotion. It's evidently clear that he's not an actor. Don Cheadle looks like he's having a lot of fun playing the villain but the script unfortunately doesn't work in his favour. The Looney Tunes were fine but I felt like they weren't utilised to their full potential here.Space Jam: A New Legacy is a film to forget. The script is very cringey and predictable, the acting isn't good and it lacks the charm and fun of the original. This is simply a massive promotion for Warner Bros and nothing else.",

            "content": "\"Space Jam: A New Legacy\" is a standalone sequel to the 1996 animation/basketball themed film \"Space Jam\". Starring NBA player LeBron James in the lead role alongside Don Cheadle, it shamelessly rehashes the original film and makes a poor attempt to appeal to all audiences.In Burbank, California, NBA superstar LeBron James and his son Dom (Cedric Joe) are sucked into a virtual world by Warner Bros.' high-tech A. I. program Al-G Rhythm (Don Cheadle). Taking Dom prisoner, Al-G promises to return him if LeBron is able to assemble a basketball team consisting of Warner Bros. Characters and beat him in a match against his own set of players. LeBron hastily agrees and is sent off flying into the virtual universe where he lands in \"Tune World\", meeting with a solitary Bugs Bunny. LeBron informs the famous cartoon rabbit of his predicament and they both agree to recruit the rest of the Looney Tunes to form their own unique basketball team to defeat Al-G once and for all.I suppose it's just my own morbid curiosity but I have a habit of greatly anticipating sequels to films that have been in development for an extended period of time. They can be worth the wait, like \"Blade Runner 2049\", which added so much more to its already established lore, or a complete disappointment, like \"Independence Day: Resurgence\", which was little more than a cash-grab rehash. \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\", or as I'm calling it, \"Ready Player LeBron\" is the latter example, doing what the original did that made it something of a cult favourite amongst 90s kids but simply applying to it a deceptive new paint job.I'm not going to act like the 1996 film was perfect, as watching it back today made me realise how badly it has aged. It was basically just a giant ad filled with Nike shoes, McDonald's Fries, and bottles of Gatorade. It also doesn't help that the now disgraced R. Kelly sang the film's theme song. With that said, it was still an amusing concept for the time, and besides, ads can still be fun to watch if they are marketed correctly. This follow-up, which comes to us a quarter of a century later, is also a giant ad, albeit, in a different sense of the word. Instead of consumer items, here we are being advertised various different IPs (Intellectual Properties) belonging to Warner Bros. Such as Harry Potter, the DC Universe, Game Of Thrones, and even The Matrix. Oh, and the Looney Tunes are in there as well in case you didn't notice by now. Normally I would love to see all of these IPs crossing over but here it's handled so poorly that I ended up dreading seeing all these different universes merging. This is because there's no sense of organisation with combining everything together, it is all carelessly thrown in there as a means for Warner Bros. To show off how many of these IPs they own the rights to. In other words, the company appears more preoccupied with being dominant over what its audience should enjoy rather than merely wishing to entertain us with some of its characters.The film is at least decent to look at, with state-of-the-art CGI effects that do a serviceable job of combining 2D cartoons with 3D environments. However, the parts I liked best were the ones where an animated LeBron James was in Tune World interacting with Bugs Bunny and the others. It's so rare to see traditionally hand-drawn animation these days, or at least a style that replicates it efficiently, so I guess that's why scenes like these stood out to me the most. That's not to say the 3D animated Looney Tunes looked terrible, although they did look a bit creepy at times, I'm just more of a fan of old school animation and the charm that comes with it.Additionally, I can't tell if it's the lazy script or bad comic timing but the film just isn't that funny. Considering the Looney Tunes are supposed to be some of the funniest cartoon characters of all time, it's a huge shame to see all their antics fall flat here. Taking the place of the slapstick humour we are used to are dated Matrix parodies, which haven't been relevant in over twenty years, and Porky Pig rapping, calling himself \"The Notorious P. I. G.\". Of course, I am aware this film's target audience is young children but how many of them are actually going to understand any of these references? Surely the filmmakers can't expect to have their parents explain every single pop culture joke to them? In total, I think there were only two parts of the entire movie I found amusing, one was a reference to a certain meme of Bugs Bunny impersonating Elmer Fudd and the other alluding to why Michael Jordan declined to return to make this sequel. The reason I am not elaborating further is because in the event that a parent who is reading this ends up dragged along to watch the film with their kid and wants something to laugh at won't have it spoiled for them.Although he's obviously not an actor by trade, I think LeBron James was able to hold his own throughout the film. I don't follow basketball so I'm not sure what type of person James is off court but here he seems like a sincere person at heart who cares about other people. His acting is surprisingly better than I expected too, which gives the impression he must have taken some lessons in order to effectively play this fictionalised version of himself. As for Don Cheadle, his character is just a generic cartoonish villain wanting nothing more than for an excuse to show off his excess power (sounds a lot like Warner Bros. Itself if you ask me). He only exists to set up the big basketball match at the end, never really feeling as though he is huge threat in the long run. Though to Cheadle's credit, he at least looks like he's having fun playing the role.In the end, \"Ready Player LeBron\", sorry, I mean \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\", was not worth waiting the extensive twenty-five years it took to get made. It does exactly what a sequel shouldn't do in rehashing the entire basic plot structure of the original while trying to pass itself off as something completely new. Upon some research, there were apparently some spin-offs considered in place of this film such as skateboarding with Tony Hawk or golfing with Tiger Woods. Those would have been much better ideas than what we got here so if there's another follow-up in the future, let's hope they follow that format instead.I rate it 4/10.",

The acting across the board is bad. Don Cheadle played about as good as he could with his character and it lacks any soul or purpose other than basically stroking Lebron's ego. There was no reason for a sequel, but the fact they got 6 writers to write and come up with this is beyond amazing tbh.

The film takes so long to get to where the audience wants it to go, and then it tries to bedazzle you with lights and characters galore, the background characters (like Pennywise, Batman, The Mask) looked so awkward.

Knows that. The use of other films to show the various time travel exploits of the Toons is real fun, and makes you wonder just how much Warner Bros actually owns. It's impressive.The movie itself is your standard hero-villain type we've always known and the storyline of LeBron James' relationship with his son is a pretty good one. Sure, there's a few plot holes and weaknesses but it's Looney Tunes where cartoons explode and are alive the next scene - take that at face value.If you're looking for something fun and enjoyed the first Space Jam, this does not disappoint.

The pacing seems fast in the beginning but it gets slowed down in the middle so that Warner Bros can show off their properties correctly and perfectly. Don Cheadle looks the most polishing one when it comes to acting, LeBron James have done it ok but Michael Jordan did a really good job when it came to getting mixed with the cartoons. In terms of story you can summarise it with just two words which is showing off IP's and making you a little emotional like it's hundred's of predecessors. In terms of fun there is loads of fun in the whole movie. Every scene of this movie is filled with characters that we cherished through our whole childhood and teenage years. Warner Bros did manage to make this movie a watchable one with your family on a weekend with their IP's but they definitely failed to catch our eyes with the story and the other stuff. Overall if you have time on the weekend and if you love Warner Bros characters, otherwise there are other films to watch on the onlineverse.",

            "content": "I admit that I enjoyed the original \"Space Jam\" movie when it came out in its day, but I also have to admit that during the subsequent 25+ years that have passed since then, my viewpoint of it has diminshed substantially; I now see that it greatly betrayed its classic characters and had them act in a way contrary to their classic images.However, I will give the original SJ this: It is a MUCH better movie than this \"Did anyone want this?\" follow-up. Where to begin? Well, here's a list of some things about this follow-up that rubbed me the wrong way:The toon characters are written in an extremely shallow manner - they hardly show any personality or depth. Any one of their classic seven minute cartoons showed more of them than this almost two hour movieThey cut out Pepe LePew from the movie for politically correct reasons, even though anyone with half a brain will see that LePew is such a broad character that's it's hard to take him and his viewpoint seriously.The voice artists for the toon characters are extremely amateurish. Now I know that voice artist Mel Blanc is long dead, but you would think that by now, Warner Brothers would have found some adequate replacements.There is no warmth in the narrative or the characters. Yes, this is supposed to be a wild raucous comedy, but you have to still have heart so the audience will care about the characters and what they are going through.The relentless bombardment of plugs for various Warner Brothers IP properties is so extreme that it goes beyond embarrassing and becomes shameless.The movie feels both too slow (such as with setting up the whole basketball challenge) and too fast (lack of character development, lack of explaining how things are in a certain situation, etc.)The decision to turn the classic Looney Tunes characters into CGI creatations for much of the movie, instead of their classic hand drawn style.I could go on, but those above points are the biggest beefs I had with this travesty. Is there anything GOOD to say about this fiasco? Well, I will admit that the movie is more technically accomplished than the first movie. There are a few small gags here and there that did make me chuckle a little. Also, the live action cast does work hard despite the shabby script given to them (even LeBron James puts in a great effort, and manages to be adequate.) It's hard to believe this movie took SIX writers to put together, but it's easy to believe that this is a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth.",

I really love everything about this movie, the visuals is rather beautiful to look at and the mixture of traditional animation, CGI animationa and live-action is very impressive and the humor is very good.

            "content": "Space Jam: A New Legacy, the cartoon sequel, brings the whole Looney Tunes gang back to the court, only this time with the reigning king of basketball, Lebron James. This comedy combines live action with animation and is filled with life lessons, funny catch phrases, loads of glitzy digital effects and a glimpse of Warner Bros. Cinematic library.When LeBron James and his son, Dom (Cedric Joe) get mysteriously sucked into the Warner Bros. Digital world by a rogue AI supervillain (Don Cheadle), nonsense and chaos ensue. Dom is kidnapped and LeBron is challenged to a high-stakes basketball game by the evil AI. Lebron must form the most winning team to get his son back and, a loss could leave him and all those he loves, stuck in the server-verse forever. Lebron and his Looney Tunes pal Bugs Bunny meet up for a wild adventure through the server-verse. Will he win, or be trapped there forever? Watch to find out.The writing is clever. It is comedic and zany at some points; at others, it is very wholesome and realistic. The animation is outstanding! The movie combines traditional animation with three-dimensional computer graphics and live action. LeBron's cartoon character is spot on. The tour through the server-verse is so enjoyable. Seeing iconic characters like Yogi Bear, Pennywise, Iron Giant and King Kong is every movie junkie's dream! Eric Bauza plays a very important role in this movie as he voices Daffy Duck, Foghorn Leghorn, Elmer Fudd, Marvin the Martian and Porky Pig. Jeff Bergman is also instrumental in this film as he voices Bugs Bunny, Sylvester and Yosemite Sam. Both Eric and Jeff voice their characters so well that it's like listening to the original cartoons! Space Jam: New Legacy also features Don Cheadle, who is the rogue AI AL. G. Rhythm. His villainous role features a wide range of emotion and I give him two thumbs up for his outstanding performance. My favorite character is Granny because she is a good-natured, protective, spunky old woman that has some epic moves.The messages of this movie are that family is everything and there is power in chasing your dreams. Sometimes, we need some loony things in our life to make it better. There is mild language and a lot of action.I give Space Jam: A New Legacy 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 7 to 18, plus adults. It's a great family movie. Fans of the original will love this, too. This movie releases July 16, 2021 in theaters and on HBO Max.Reviewed by Katherine S., KIDS FIRST!",

            "content": "IN A NUTSHELL:\nA rogue artificial intelligence kidnaps the son of famed basketball player LeBron James, who then has to work with Bugs Bunny to win a basketball game. There are some entertaining moments for sure, but it's one gigantic commercial for Warner Brothers IP properties, which is a huge turnoff for most viewers. The target audience is definitely kids. Their parents who grew up watching the original movie might be annoyed and let down.The film is directed by Malcolm D. Lee. Are you Team Tune or Team Goon? This is a spoiler-free movie review.THINGS I LIKED:\nIf you're a LeBron James fan, you'll love this movie because it features him, showcasing a bunch of real-life clips from his historical career.If you're a Warner Brothers cartoon character fan, you'll love seeing all of your favorites. Berg Bergen is the only voice actor to return from the original Space Jam movie of 1996.Academy Award nominee Don Cheadle is great, as expected. He was just nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series. Good on him. He's a wonderful actor and he seemed to have a lot of fun with his role in this film. He plays AL G. Rythm (algorithm)\nThere's a lot of humor, although not all of it lands. LeBron is good about letting them take a lot of jabs at him and his career.Tons of fun movie references and clips of film classics like Superman: The Movie, Batman (1989), Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, THE MATRIX, The Wizard of Oz, Mad Max: Fury Road, Wonder Woman, and soooo many more.If you're not that much into basketball, there are still plenty of non-basketball shenanigans to enjoy.TONS of fun Easter Eggs! Look closely!Lots of entertaining cameo performances and voice talents from other sports stars like Sue Bird, Anthony Davis, Draymond Green, Damian Lillard, Nneka Ogwumike, Diana Taurasi, and so many more.There's an awesome Michael Jordan gag that actually made me laugh out loud. Loved it.It's super entertaining to look at the audience during the big game to pick out all kinds of characters from zillions of Warner Brothers movies.I've always loved movies that combine animation with real-life actors. I enjoyed the different animation styles.The movie features the huge E3 conference. One of my sons competed in that when he was in college. He now does art design on video games at Blizzard!If you love basketball, you'll get a kick out of the \"server-verse\" version of the game.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\nWarner Brothers promotes itself HARD in this movie.As great as LeBron James is at basketball, he's not a very good actor. I don't think anyone is very surprised by that, but it's a shame because LeBron is in almost every scene in the movie.The movie tries to cram WAY too much into every scene.Visually, it's sometimes hard to catch everything because things fly by so fast and furiously.The explanation at the very end of the movie about the demise of a certain character was incredibly lame and lazy writing.There is some super cheesy writing as well.Warner Brothers cartoon fans have already been complaining that we don't see enough of the cartoons. I disagree. There is plenty of cartoon chaos.All of the Extras in the audience during the game don't always react correctly to what's actually happening in the game. It just looks like they were filmed cheering to be inserted into the scenes later, which of course they were. I'm just saying that it really looks like it.The soundtrack isn't as good as the first movie.The plot is just silly with ridiculously high stakes.TIPS FOR PARENTS:\nLots of cartoon violence.Mild profanity. One character is obviously spewing profanities in one scene, but they humorously get bleeped out.There are a lot of references to R-rated movies that kids won't understand or recognize.You can see my full movie review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",

It just did not make me feel anything. I re-watched the original Space Jam before watching this one and Oh! How much fun that movie was!

The premise of the film sees Lebron James sucked into an artificial world where he must unite the Toon Squad to win a game of Basketball.Main Character\nAs mentioned above, Lebron James plays himself as the lead character and he seems like a pretty charismatic guy in real life but that is not the case here. He is so boring to watch here, and for the majority of the film he is just reacting to what is going on with the whole world. The film forces him to deliver some emotional scenes and he just can't do it and it really makes the film fall flat.Supporting Characters\nDon Cheadle plays the bad guy in the film and he just looks like he is having a really fun time with the role, this is no great villain performance but he is possibly the most entertaining part of the film and that has to count for something. Onto the toons and they are pretty entertaining, the old classics are there by Buggs Bunny, Wile Coyote and Foghorn Leghorn and memories of my childhood came back. But they also get put into the background for Lebron, I never really got Zendaya voicing Lola Bunny and guys like Semmity Sam and Daffy Duck have little to do and the biggest negative is giving my favourite character Marvin Martian barely anything to do. I didn't really care for Lebron's onscreen son and Sonequa Martin-Green is really wasted as Lebron's wife.Story\nThe story offers very little. The whole theme of fatherhood is let down by weak performances and a weak dramatic script. The first film had the looney tunes in the forefront but here they feel like afterthoughts, in favour for Warner Bros very clear poor marketing and they try to cram all these franchises that they own in order to try and convince you to watch them. This is despite the demographic of young kids will have no idea what half of these franchises even are.Script\nThe script does have a few chuckle worthy moments and although I complained about the obvious marketing ploy, a lot of the cameos were quite funny to me as a big film fan. But the drama really isn't there and a good chunk of the comedy feels like it should have been left in the prime days of the tunes.Style\nThe animation for this film is pretty great, it looks exactly like it should for the majority, until it goes to more CGI instead of animation and it becomes a bit strange. Also this film felt really long, the last basketball game itself feels like an hour long and I shouldn't be feeling like that in a family friendly film with Looney Tunes characters.Overall\nOverall, Space Jam: New Legacy is a bad film. It will have some people who grew up with The Looney Tunes and the original film but they will not like it and kids shouldn't be bought up watching this garbage of a film cause it has some nice visuals.Rating - 3/10.",

            "content": "A ironically hilarious film but an absolutely terrible film none the less. Everything about this film doesn't work. The story, the acting, the CGI, the references, the script. All of it feels terrible compared to the first film. The first film isn't that great either but at least it was self aware. This isn't. The film doesn't understand when it is making fun of itself and it shows. I enjoyed the references in the first film as they felt natural but this was Ready Player One on steroids and if you don't like Ready Player One like me, then this will be a nightmare. Sometimes there are cool Easter eggs in the background but some of it feels weird. I love A Clockwork Orange but it still feels weird to see a bunch of characters from that movie watching a Basketball Game. The humor is unintentionally funny. I never laughed at a joke they were trying to make but I laughed at almost everything else because it was so bad that it's funny. I enjoyed watching this movie but that was probably because I was with friends. I feel like watching this on your own is a painful experience. I did find myself being painfully bored during points but the jokes my friends were making and their reactions helped keep my interest. All of the performances are AWFUL. Lebron James did an awful job. Michael Jordan wasn't great in the first film either but his performance felt intentionally funny but this was just painful to watch. Don Cheadle was really weird as well. The only reason I kind of enjoyed his performance was because I was joking about him the whole time. The script is the most predictable boring story ever. The first film's script was predictable as well but the journey to get there was fun and this wasn't fun. The visual effects look kind of decent at times except Live Action Lola Bunny. Her eyes look really really weird for some reason. I would really only recommend this if you watch it with friends. It's a lot funnier to watch this with other people than on your own.",

The story is simple but its a kids film, Dad has to save his son from an evil computer AI by playing basketball. The original former basketball player has to help Looney Toons after their world gets invaded. Both are so simple but people expect character development from a bunch of Cartoons and a Basketball player. We know who Lebron is and the Toons aren't going to change.The positives of the movie is that the Don Cheadle is goofy and a likeable villain who just wants to be human and appreciated. No one can deny the toons aren't likable same as Mickey Mouse just transcends every generation from their first introduction. As mentioned before the final game makes for great animations and shows how far these animators have come! Feel like a true video game not just Toon World. There's far to many cameos and nods to other films throughout the movie, recurring the Toons is just fun for old and young! Never thought i'd see Mad Max and a Clockwork orange in the film film let alone a kids animation!Then this is where we get the issues with the movie, no matter how simple the film is it doesnt hold you throughout the middle section of preparing for the game. Never really bought the father/ son relationship but didn't land. They tried to re-create Wayne Knights characters in Khris Davis but its the same script just played by a different person but not as well! A positive can also be a negative when having such adult characters being apart of the movie but changing Lola bunny for no reason for being to adult but keeping them involved, you literally have Pennywise next to the group that coined the phrase \"Ultra Violence\" just an odd choice from the WB execs. Flintstones, Yogi and Booboo, all DC characters and Harry Potter are all perfectly fine for kids but imagine having to explain what Game of Thrones is to a 4 year old!Overall its simple fun with some good laughs but can see why people arent happy with the remake and being disappointed!",

Second, the plot is a little too complicated and much of it feels very first draft level as a screenplay. The original movie had a much more simpler plot and despite its length had better focus and pacing. Third, it's not as immersive as the original. In that movie you had a better played out basketball game whereas here the court is too overpacked with very noticeable background characters who are definitely extras dressed as iconic characters from Warner Bros. Film and television history that probably should've been blurred out to hide the phoniness of it all. Fourth, the opposing team is not memorable or as intimidating as the original's The Monstars. Those things aside there are some pretty effective jokes and meta commentary on display and each of the Tunes get enough to shine and their voice artists all seem to be bringing plenty of energy. LeBron James is LeBron James, can't really say anything else because he is playing himself. Don Cheadle seems to be having the time of his life playing the villain, and there is lots of creativity on the screen that illustrates that the filmmakers were having a good time making it. The problem again is the screenplay: too many cooks in the kitchen, and not enough time spent on ideas that would've had more emotional impact if handled better or had more time spent on them. There is a lot of things you could have done with this that would've actually made it a vast improvement over what had come before but alas most of everything is so first draft level the best it succeeds at is as just being an entertaining but ultimately forgettable family film.",

While the original Space Jam (1996) was also a corporate cash grab, it at least had a distinct sense of charm and fun that is severely lacking here. The film felt more like a 2 hour long advertisement for the various properties that Warner Brother own than an actual film. The references to R-rated properties such as Mad Max, The Matrix and Game of Thrones seem out of place for a family film (cynics could say the film is targeted at millennials)The plot centres around the strained relationship between LeBron James' relationship with his youngest son Dom, who wants to be a video game developer rather than a basketballer like his Dad. After the two are sucked into the 'Warnerverse' they are pitted against one another in a game of basketball based on the game Dom has been developing ('Domball'). This is not an emotionally investing storyline mainly due to James' stilted performance which may be worse than Michael Jordan's in the original. I guess there is a positive parental message here regarding letting your kids chase their own dreams rather than impose your own onto them. It could have been executed much better though.I like to find the positives where I can, and the animation and CGI in the film is really vibrant and pops off the screen. It's easily the highlight of the film but unfortunately it has nothing to back it up with - I found the film exceptionally tedious and the jokes were mostly cringeworthy and unfunny. The most humour I got out of the experience was how awfully brazen and out-of-place a lot of references were. Pennywise the Clown and the Night King enjoying a game of basketball? Rick and Morty dropping off the Tasmanian Devil onto the heroes? What even was going on in this film?Really I can't recommend this film in any capacity. It's an overly long and thoroughly dull slog through Warner Brothers self-congratulatory vanity project that seems to lack any sense of self-awareness. I couldn't wait for this one to finish.",

            "content": "Similar to the first film; NBA superstar plays in animated environment against a team made up of copied and toonified NBA superstars, to ultimately learn a lesson about how he should treat his family. Oh, and his kid does some wild tapping on a keyboard/scanning stuff with his phone and there is a risk with giving AI too much control. Fun in places, nostalgic in others, but ultimately too much crammed in for one film.First of all, LeBron may be (I don't follow the sport) a great basketball player, but he never appeared comfortable on screen. There was basically zero chemistry between him and Cedric Joe, who's playing his son, and even the emotions associated with being toonified - like the crux of the film - looked pretty underwhelming to him. At first, this fits with the films message about family, but his best scenes come when he's turned into a toon and the animators cut loose. Why they didn't use his real family for the brief live action parts and increase the animated parts, I don't know.Secondly, this as a montage advert for a studio that's trying to gain new audiences (or other studio to buy them) for their back catalogue. With the number of films/shows/characters they've shoehorned in, it's worth a second watch; from Harry Potter to Batman (animated and live action) and the Justice League. From the Flintstones, Jetsons, Animaniacs and the old aliens from the first Space Jam, through King Kong, Game of Thrones, and - weirdly for kids film - the Matrix, Mad Max: Fury Road, Austin Powers, and Casablanca. They even had the Wizard of Oz and Clockwork Orange characters. Most of these made no sense to my under 10's, and the film executives - Sarah Silverman and Steven Yeun - scene was so meta it completely lost their attention. The Harry Potter parts got their attention, but I couldn't see them leaving going \"I really want to watch Iron Giant\" because of this film. Could see WB making a series with crossovers like this, sure, but here it was too fast to fully appreciate but too slow for the action of the film. Who were they actually supporting?Even the bad guy seemed derivative. An Artificial Intelligence; Al G. Rhythm! It's a name that made me think of the Animaniacs space episode where Al Gore is Al-5000 (2001: A Space Odyssey take off). They could have at least had him dance a bit more? For Don Cheadle this is easy money; he doesn't have to move much and after his years of Marvel CGI he's probably very used to acting to nothing, in front of a green screen. It was all very clever, but, again, why they didn't have a fully animated bad guy, I don't know.That's what saved this film and made it enjoyable; it's toon craziness. In a world sick of lockdown and Covid, job worries and family crisis, and where film goers are still asking who can pick up Thors hammer or why can't DC find enough light bulbs so their films aren't so dark, seeing an animated duck with its bill on backwards or randomly blowing stuff up with a truck load of dynamite is just fun. The Toon Squad training, the animated physics of falling, and simply all those cameos of old characters made me smile. It's just annoying they included so much annoying live action to get there.",

Lebron might have taken acting lessons from Shaq's Kazaam tapes.The original Space Jam story made a lot more sense, feels like a documentary compared to outrageous things that happen in Space Jam 2.

It actually really made great use of other co-stars like Charles Barkley, Larry Bird, Bill Murray, and who could forget the original Space Jam had the GREATEST, MOST AMAZING soundtrack ever!! (I even bought the CD at the time... if you know what CD's are...)There isn't even any good music in this new Space Jam 2 movie. Not to mention we all know the controversy with Lola Bunny getting a major downgrade as well. (Thanks Karens and overly sensitive World today)It's funny how NBA today is just high scoring over 120+ points/lack of defense; where in the 90's, it was normal for a lot of games to be held under 100; even in the original Space Jam, the final game score for the ToonSquads were under 80 points against the Monstars. And then we got Space Jam 2 where it's a ridiculous video game, with video game looking CG loony toons, with outrageous scoring rules going over 1000 points.... okay.It's true, Warner Bros really just wanted to self-promote and show off their catalog, in a Ready Player One-like scenes that really makes no sense.I have to admit, the \"MJ\" cameo during half-time was hilarious though. And the little twist with Bugs Bunny was actually touching, I think it made cry (LOL), but overall you knew it was never going to top the original GOAT.The original Space Jam really felt like a theatrical blockbuster movie with great story, cameos, and unforgettable soundtrack - and of course the greatest basketball player of all time. Space Jam 2 definitely has a straight to stream quality TV-Movie. Space Jam 3 with Jeremy Lin on YouTube is actually better than this.",

But certainly better than what we got here, especially as a smaller filmmaker.I do have good things about the sequel, though. The animation is great! I like how it keeps the usual charm of the Looney Tunes and is the best part of the movie. More specifically the 2D animation... the CGI is okay.I also liked the last 25 minutes, that being the basketball game's final quarters where the Looney Tunes get to be their usual selves which is entertaining and sometimes, even funny to watch.With that said, there are problems that make this a slam disappointment.The acting isn't the best, but hey, at least it isn't like 2003's The Room.The plot is like the first film, mixed with a message hammered into your head: Looney Tunes gathering together to play basketball with a superstar, the team wins, etc. The message of being yourself is fine enough, but what seriously bothers me is that every 5 minutes of the movie, it's \"You've got to get your son back!\". I know this is a kids movie, but that is a poor excuse for any movie. Kids have more vivid imaginations and would get the point after just one or two times, let alone nearly 10.Sooo, what gives the movie a 4 out of 10 for me? The overuse of IPs! I am not kidding when I say this but I kept getting very distracted by these pop-culture references (although the cartoons being added into WB films like Mad Max: Fury Road or The Matrix sounds like a cool idea at first) as well as Warner Bros showcasing every franchise, brand and character they own! Even getting Rick & Morty (a show intended for Adult Swim, btw) to have a cameo. Kids aren't going to get every reference and the fact they play specific music for Harry Potter or whatnot feels rather cringy to me. It feels like I'm watching a 2 hour long WB commercial for their stuff; that it's my biggest issue of the movie.Yeah, this is a 115 minute film! Imagine Warner Brothers shoving their IPs into your face for that long, including smaller details in the background for money to get their products or see them. Sure, kids may enjoy the animation and other aspects but honestly, WB shoving in their IPs (including their own logo seen at the start of their films) just makes me not enjoy it enough to be called good. There are some good stuff but everything else was distracting or just plain not good.With that, a 4/10 is good in my book thanks to the repetition (including the plot) and Warner Bros making a hammering, promotional commercial rather than, oh idk, a true Looney Tunes sequel. I don't care for huge promotional stuff, I'd rather entertain with something actually fun, like a live basketball game.",

It's supposed to be corny, so was the first space jam...but this? Omg. Worst story premise on the face of the earth and then it had the nerve to try to make you feel something at the end??? You know what I feel Lebron? Anger. Anger for you wasting 2 hours of my life with this hot garbo. I moderately like Lebron as a person and an athlete and I just find there is no earthly way he watched this movie and thought it was good and ready for release - no sane person could have. I'd be interested to hear his true thoughts. This was honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life and I'm not even exaggerating. After the opening scene, pure cringe pedal to the metal all the way through. I physically cringed watching the movie. Every scene belongs on r/cringetopia - as a matter of fact I wouldn't be surprised if I went to the sub right now and it was all clips of this movie. Shame on you Warner Bros.

Almost every attempt of humor is just a reference and this whole movie feels like a really long commercial. Like honestly why do I need clockwork orange in a kids movie, like did the film makers even WATCH that movie??? The original space jam wasn't great sure, but it was obviously good enough to make a sequel. All of the acting is terrible, the story is incredibly bland and formulated. This movie just simply feels like it's capitalizing on previous existing properties and adds absolutely nothing to anything it's capitalizing on. The soundtrack is garbage, which is dreadfully sad because the original space jam had a genuinely awesome soundtrack, whereas not a single song in this entire movie is actually good enough to remember after the movies finished. The writing is abhorrent, you can very visibly see that in the trailer.

I may not be blinded by nostalgia but let's be real, Space Jam isn't, well, the classic everyone thinks it is. I'm a 90s kid and I didn't think much of it then either. Trailers for the sequel played in front of nearly everything I saw the past couple months, and I've just about had it. Until I actually saw it. By no means is this a masterpiece but it sure is a lot of fun.The script - by six credited writers (four of whom receive story credit) - isn't winning any awards anytime soon (except maybe a Razzie), but the hackneyed cliches and tropes can be easily overlooked by a quality performance by LeBron James, his acting chops previously seen in 2015's Trainwreck, and Don Cheadle, who clearly knows what he's working with and spares no time in hamming it up far past eleven. The only real nitpick I have cast-wise is Zendaya as Lola Bunny. Now I'm a \"Zswagger\", having enjoyed her past work (Euphoria, The Greatest Showman and the Marvel Cinematic Universe), but the in-jokes at the previous, albeit standalone, film would have fared more comfortably with Kath Soucie.James plays a fictionalized version of himself, father of three, his youngest son Dom is a tech prodigy who doesn't want to follow in Dad's footsteps. While at Warner Bros. Studios, Dom is lured into the \"Serververse\" by rogue artificial intelligence Al-G-Rhythm (get it?), who wagers LeBron to a basketball game wherein his and Dom's freedom depends on winning. Upon being thrown through virtual space to Tune World, LeBron, now in 2D animation (hopefully, we'll get more of that in the near future), meets Bugs Bunny and learns that the other Tunes have been exploring other realities, persuaded by Al-G.Up to this point, it was all merely self-aware. Here, it takes being a WB product and kicking it right in the \"balls\". The realities are other assorted Warner-owned properties, including but not limited to, DC Comics, Harry Potter, Animaniacs, Hanna-Barbera, The Wizard of Oz and a number of considerably more adult-oriented franchises, i.e. Game of Thrones, RoboCop, Mad Max, The Matrix, Austin Powers, and Rick and Morty. But the barrage of cameos doesn't stop there; a blink-and-you'll-miss-it shows Bugs transforming into Internet meme Big Chungus, and at the big game, Beetlejuice, The Mask, the Gremlins, Pennywise, the Droogs from the ultraviolent Kubrick thriller A Clockwork Orange and (this still baffles me) Sister Jeanne of Ken Russell's highly controversial (and WB's equivalent of how Disney feels about Song of the South) The Devils. Her appearance is far more frequent and leaves one to wonder if the studio plans to acknowledge the film in any capacity anytime soon.In the long run, Space Jam: A New Legacy, while not necessarily good, is regardless entertaining. It's like Ready Player One or any given MCU movie: don't expect anything substantial, just go with it and have fun pointing out the Easter eggs. 2.5/5.",

            "content": "Prior to watching the film, I saw so many critics claiming that the original version had a soul and this one couldn't hold a candle to it. I couldn't understand what made them say that since the original was also a cash grab, taking advantage of Michael Jordan's popularity, reviving the Looney Tunes, and maybe trying to create a show for those little alien creatures from \"moron planet.\" After watching this new version, I can now see the heart and soul of the original one and how this one lacks it.The first Space Jam was by no means a cinematic masterpiece, but it had effort, it was fun. It didn't have to try so hard. The Looney Tunes didn't have to try so hard to appease to their modern audience, they were still as looney as they were in the 30s - 60s and it worked ! The story was sloppy but still fun cos it had a cast that made it so. Michael Jordan didn't deliver an Oscar worthy performance or even a good performance for that matter, but you could tell he was having fun. It just worked, it was a mess, but it worked. I loved this film as a kid and I still enjoy it as an adult even though now I can see it's flaws better. But even with its flaws, it's still miles and miles better than this new version.Warner Brothers took the Disney route and decided to make a film where they show off all their intellectual properties in ways that aren't necessary. If \"Ralph Breaks The Internet\" left a bad taste in your mouth, then I suggest you avoid this new Space Jam film. They decided to cram almost every notable character, film, show from their library into the film. I guess they felt The Looney Tunes, alone, weren't enough to entertain this new generation of kids or (the more probable version) it's a shameless long ad for whatever streaming service they may have planned for the future.They tried to create a touching father, son story for the film but there's nothing touching about it cos we spend only one scene establishing that Lebron has high expectations for his son and his son can't reach them cos he's his own person. The movie latches to that one scene to carry the rest of the poorly written story. The villain in this film is the algorithm of Warner Brother's library, played by Don Cheadle, who wants Lebron for reasons I still can't understand. He lures Lebron to the Warner Brothers studio, Lebron brings his son with him to the meeting, Lebron refuses whatever deal was offered to him and from there Don Cheadle decides to kidnap Lebron and his son to get his way. Listen this \"Al. G. Rithim\" character is just a poorly written excuse to enter the world of Warner Brothers where you will be hit with intellectual property after intellectual property of Warner Brothers - just like Ralph Breaks The Internet. When Lebron goes into Looney Tunes world, Bugs Bunny is the only Looney Tune there cos the other Looney Tunes decided to explore the other universes in the Warner Brothers library. Yet another written excuse to show off the characters and films that Warner Brothers owns. Actually the final basketball game is the ultimate show off of all their intellectual properties.Now for The Looney Tunes in this film. They lost their classic touch, that even Space Jam in the 90's let them keep. This version made them cringe worthy with lines like \"Haters gonna hate,\" Porky Pig raps, and the rest hardly speak. A couple of lines here and there, Daffy (a normally funny Looney Tune) is not funny at all in this film, Zendaya (fantastic as she may be) is no Lola Rabbit. Her voice doesn't match Lola at all. The only Looney Tune that stayed faithful to the classic was Marvin Martian, a Looney Tune, that was noticeably missing in the original version - not sure why since he was so popular in the 90's. All in all they're very underwhelming and take a backseat for the other intellectual properties that Warner Brothers wants to show off. It is through them that Lebron realizes that perhaps he was being too hard on his son cos he keeps trying to prevent them from being looney, for basketball purposes. They just tried really hard to make the Looney Tunes interesting to their modern young audience, which is a big mistake in my opinion. My 8 year old cousin loves the classic Looney Tunes as they are, he even watches the old cartoons on HBO Max, he doesn't need them to try to act urban or c0oL for him to like them. Also they included the \"big chungus\" meme cos \"see kids, we're in with the times, haha Warner Brothers is just like you haha\"This review is really dragging on, but I can write you a book on how this film is terrible and could never come close to the original Space Jam (which isn't even that high of a standard !) I thought Michael Jordan would've made a cameo, but instead the little alien villains from the original did and Michael B. Jordan made a cameo cos \"haha, heehee, they got the wrong Michael Jordan !\" I now see what the critics meant when they say the original Space Jam had a heart and a soul, cos after watching this awful reboot, you'll realize it did. There was effort put into the original Space Jam and something fun and memorable was actually created, this new version is a shameless cash grab that doesn't bother to hide that this is what it's doing. They've decided to follow in Disney's \"no longer hiding it\" cash grab footsteps and it is unfortunate. I hope I didn't see The Iron Giant so many times cos those disconnected, money hungry producers plan on doing a reboot of that awesome movie. I'm not even going to go over Lebron's acting skills cos he's not an actor and neither was Michael Jordan. Don Cheadle didn't even bother with his character, while everyone else was trying really hard to be funny or even give the impression that they were making an effort, Sarah Silverman included.3 stars, I would ideally leave it at 1, but my 8 year old cousin enjoyed it and at the end of the day he's the one they made this atrocity for. Yet even he agreed, that the original is better. I don't recommend this film at all, just stream the original one.",

            "content": "Let me preface this review by saying that as a kid I loved the original Space Jam with Michael Jordan. When I heard that a new one was coming I felt that it seemed unnecessary since the story after all these years didn't need a continuation. The movie's existence didn't bother me in the slightest, though. The movie itself however was hard to sit through.The acting by LeBron is horrendous. It's even worse than Jordan's back in the day and that was surprising because he was alright in the Amy Shumer movie. The number of times his delivery is wooden is astonishing. Then the kid playing his son. You cannot blame him too much because of his age but it was a chore to watch him play throughout the movie. Production value seems lacking as well. The 2D animation ist fluid and the CGI characters just look weird. Especially the Looney Tunes like Bugs Bunny.Now to the actually important part... The story itself. The idea of an emotional algorhythm is quite a stretch but OK. However, the characters are almost all insufferable. LeBron is an ignorant character which he is supposed to, but to an extent that a redemption arc cannot really safe him and even later in the movie he's a show off and full of himself which rubbed me the wrong way. For instance instead of being called LeBron he's being mostly referred to as the 'King' which takes out all the potential for some kind of realistic friendship with the Tunes. His son is an idiotic brat that is all about himself, as well. The algorhythm is admittedly the antagonist, but the only reason for him to be be like that is that his feelings - as a program - are hurt. The only really likable people are in fact the Tunes. Unfortunately apart from Bugs and Lola Bunny no-one gets to really shine except from one little scene for most of them during the game.On a positive note, the message the movie wants to convene is nice. You be you and don't let anyone force you to be someone you're not. I laughed twice during this movie which isn't much for a comedy but I thought I'd mention it anyway.Generally speaking, this movie is boring most of the time, annoying at others and simply put a lazy cash grab for the studio which it additionally uses to market everything else that's from Warner Bros. From Harry Potter through Game of Thrones to the Matrix, the Mask and many others you see them in the movie. Not because they serve a purpose, no. The only reason is to remind you that they created those things as well and you love them probably.Avoid this movie would be my suggestion because it represents many things that are wrong with movies and media in our time.",

LeBron is the sports figure here-Michael Jordan was in the original-that gets roped into the cyber world of an artificial intelligence bad guy played by Don. Cedric plays LeBron's son, who gets kidnapped by Don to force LeBron to play a game of basketball in the serververse-kind of like in the Matrix. LeBron's wife is played by Sonequa. LeBron enlists the Looney Toons characters-Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, etc,-to help him win and try to rescue his son. The effects are good and there are lots of cameos-mostly in the crowd scenes-to keep an eye out for, both real and animated. The cameos range from sports figures to Warner Bros. Properties and even other sources. I remember seeing King Kong, Batman & Robin, It, Game of Throne characters, Harry Potter characters, The Wizard of Oz characters....well, you get the drift. During the end credits, there are photos of the toons and real people-such as Porky Pig fighting Ronda Rousey-but nothing at the very end, except the signature line is heard, 'That's All, Folks!'.It's rated \"PG\" for cartoon violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 55 minutes.If you have little ones, it would be a good one for the family.

            "review_title": "Fails where the original Space Jam succeeded--being a watchable movie",
            "content": "The original Space Jam, if we remember, was this super exciting movie where we got to see the Looney Tunes intellectual property outside of their domain and interacting with the real world and THE Michael Jordan. Real celebrities and sports stars played themselves in the movie. It was meta, self-referential, and irreverent towards pop culture at the time. These concepts were really exciting in the 1990s-look at what Scream did with horror cliches, and what Casper did with celebrity cameos around the same time period. We loved it, and Space Jam capitalized on all of this stuff while still giving us a fun, watchable movie. The unfortunately can't be said for this new Space Jam.The original Space Jam managed to fit a pretty lean, economical screenplay around these pop culture references and goofy distractions--there's a very, very clear three-act structure with some A, B, and C storylines running throughout that generally all carry through pretty clear arcs and wrap themselves up sufficiently without much head-scratching afterwards. You can go back and watch the original and see that it is well-paced, there's nothing that feels unnecessary that makes the story drag or raise a bunch of questions, and it does a satisfactory job of just being a fun movie. It's an extremely easy watch. It's not a \"good\" movie, but it's a well executed family fun movie that hits all of its beats and gets out without overstaying its welcome. The acting is lousy and it feels like a cheesy 90s time capsule, because of course it is. But it is entertaining. It does its main job of just being a watchable movie.Going into the new Space Jam, I expected nothing except a watchable movie and getting to see Lebron goof around with the Looney Tunes, as well as the occasional pop culture gags/distractions.What I got, however, was a really, really tough watch.Lebron is written as a mean, domineering, out of touch father and his very first introduction onscreen is extremely unflattering as a result, which makes our protagonist highly unlikable from the very start.MJ in the original Space Jam was written as not only a loving father, but they managed to also successfully portray the greatest athlete of all time as an underdog, and we totally buy it. They even leveraged the actual events of his real life into the story to ground him and make him likable, and it paid dividends in the final product. It was a very, very shrewd way of using a meta approach to effectively drive storytelling forward. In this case, Lebron is kinda rude and makes his own kid resent him as a result. There is no attempt made at grounding Lebron's character in any way like MJ was. Lebron doesn't need to be an underdog per se, but give us something about him as a real person to root for at least. We got nothing from this screenplay in this regard.A little later on, the main conflict arises and I watch Lebron get sucked into the serververse by Don Cheadle to go on a frantic search for his kid. I'm basically going \"wait, why is he suddenly so emotionally invested in this? He has been nothing but cold, mean, and distant with this kid the entire time.\" There was nothing particularly meaningful developed between Lebron and his son before the kid goes missing, so it's tough to buy that Lebron is just devastated that the kid is gone. On top of this, a completely unnecessary and extremely poorly fleshed out wrinkle is added as a way to raise the stakes--he has to find the son or else his millions of instagram followers get stuck in the server forever. The social media followers were and are never a part of the story and are simply thrown in to raise the stakes because the kid being gone clearly wasn't enough to get an audience invested (this is being used as a crutch for poor character development). It's a tough narrative sell and I don't buy it.In Space Jam 1, the motivations were incredibly simple yet effective: Michael has to get back in time for his baseball game. His family, who he deeply loves, will worry about him. The NBA players will lose their talent if he doesn't. They will all be slaves on Moron Mountain. All of these things are sufficiently developed and explained beforehand, so when they are used as leverage to raise the stakes for MJ, we totally buy it and are invested. These stakes feel real and scary, and we root so hard for the Tune Squad as a result. This new Space Jam story makes the old Space Jam screenplay feel like an economical masterpiece on par with Die Hard.I don't worry about the son's plight in this new Space Jam, because every interaction with the most important adult in his life (the movie's protagonist Lebron) that he's had up to this point has been extremely negative and the villain is the only adult in the movie who overtly connects with him on a personal level and encourages him in his pursuits. Being stuck in the server forever with a very supportive Don Cheadle and his cute lovable Pixar-style sidekick looks and feels like a far better option here--it doesn't feel like he's been kidnapped or is being held against his will whatsoever. The son is very, very clearly enjoying his time in captivity and it just kills the sort of damsel in distress archetype it's shooting for here. It's really, really bizarre to see a kidnapped kid enjoying his time and never, ever once asking, \"where is my dad?\" or maybe saying, \"let me out of here, I want to go home.\" What is going on here?The movie is absolutely loaded with forced, hamfisted, and genuinely corny (not in a funny dad joke way) references to existing Warner Brothers IP. I believe I counted four (4) overt references to The Matrix of all things (remember in the late 90s when it was common to see a Matrix slo-mo bullet dodge reference? It obviously got old quickly, even back then). These all honestly get very old, very fast. There's too much, none of the references are creative or particularly funny, and they really do make the movie drag along more than it already is. It all just serves as filler. The same goes for the insane amount of CGI effects in this movie. I marveled at it, not only for how much work went into it by the artists, but also at how utterly unnecessary it was and how much it dragged out scenes to be way longer than they needed to be so that we could wait on actors to wave their hands and arms all over the place to interact with the CG stuff. If there's any way a CGI thing can be used, it is. There's zero discretion in this regard. It's pure filler and incredibly distracting most of the time. With all due respect to the artists and the hours they put in, its a huge technological achievement but incredibly over the top as a result. You really get the sense that this is what the movie is built around, rather than all of it being built around a movie.The original Space Jam has occasional cameos and some breaking of the fourth wall, and uses the Looney Tunes IP and some minor corporate product placement as part of the meta/self referential pop culture shtick it was doing. Some of these ideas and sequences have aged better than others, sure, but none of it feels unnecessarily forced or crazy over the top and it all went over fairly well originally without detracting from the story or taking time away from developing characters. They were built around the movie--the movie was not built around it.TL;DR: Ultimately, the new space jam fails where the original Space Jam succeeded--in being a watchable movie.",

            "content": "Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021) is a movie we recently saw in theatres two days ago. The storyline follows LeBron James who wants his son to be a basketball player while his son is more interested in designing and building video games. When WB approaches LeBron about a new campaign, which was designed by their own Artificial Intelligence (AI), LeBron hates the idea and turns it down, upsetting the AI. The AI decides to kidnap his son and only allows him to return home if Bron can beat the AI at a game of basketball. Bron will be given his team of toons to work with while the AI forms his own goon squad. This movie is directed by Malcolm D. Lee (The Best Man) and stars LeBron James, Don Cheadle (Crash), Sarah Silverman (School of Rock), Steven Yeun (Walking Dead) and Lil Rel Howery (Get Out). The storyline for the holistic movie is nothing special, but the toon characters are awesome and their introductions into the film was magnificent (the best segments of either film are in this picture - the Matrix and Mad Max sequences are legendary). I loved the background characters at the game and loved how Disney showed they do more than cartoons and super heroes (The Nun, It, Gremlins, etc). The animation for this film was excellent and superior to the first film (as you'd expect). Overall, this was a lot of fun for the family and a hair below the original. People who complain about this film forget the first Space Jam wasn't good either. I'd score this a 5/10 and recommend taking your kids to see it.",

LeBron and the kids were wholly unbelievable, but the mother was decent as the no nonsense member of their family.While the upgraded graphics were really good, the best parts of the movie were where they were cutting on LeBron for various things he has done in his career and Porky Pigs rap solo in my opinion.The only thing that may have saved this movie was if Michael Jordan really had walked into the locker room instead of Michael B.

Viewing it left such a bad impression that I waited a few weeks before watching the sequel.My expectations for the movie were low, given the many horrible reviews. After a slow start, the film took off and found its groove. I found myself laughing out loud several times. When done, I went and read the reviews. I don't get why there is so much hate. Nor why there is so much love for the original. Two key points I'd like to make.1) Many complained \"this is just product placement\" given the wealth of Warner television and movies scattered throughout the story. I have to wonder if these are the same people that were in awe of the same level of product in \"Ready Player One.\" I guess that movie tugged at \"nostalgia,\" but this one is only \"product placement.\" Whatever. I didn't see it that way at all. Warner crammed this movie with so many Easter Eggs it will take multiple viewings and endless pause/rewind to find them. Just check out the endless YouTube videos out there listing what others have found. Personally, I absolutely LOVED this aspect of the movie.2) The original Looney Tunes cartoons often operated on two levels. Kids got the slapstick fun and silly gags. Adults often caught a different set of jokes targeted at them. So, when people complain about \"Why are there these adult movie references in a kids movie?\" The answer is simple - the joke is for the parents.I rated this movie an 8/10 because I think kids will have a blast. There's a heartwarming story woven throughout the film. The VFX are fantastic. I also feel the Warner references show a huge level of care and detail put into the script. Lebron does a fine acting job. IMO it runs about 15 minutes too long and could have used a bit more editing to improve the pace. Otherwise, it's a blast.",

All the humans are unlikeable, which is unfortunate considering most of them are playing themselves. The best acting came from the cartoon characters lol. The only good thing were the special effects and I kinda liked the IP use when it came to Warner Bros using different worlds from their movies and shows but it got old fast and most of the time it was just blatant product placement and didn't really further the adventure in a fun and captivating way. The movie was also too long. I watched maybe the first 45 minutes and that was enough for me. It has WB corporate's slimy hands all over it. Zero replay value. Glad it bombed.",

I never really laughed, the most this movie got out of me was a couple smiles. And that's it. Only time I came close to laughing was the Michael B Jordan. Cameo. That was pretty good. Other than that, I watched it and was disappointed and will never watch it again. I thought Lebron acted well for not having a lot of movies under his belt and he was funny in Trainwreck so I gave him the benefit of the doubt with this movie. Not even gonna compare it to the original. Doesn't compete. Even if the original didn't exist and this movie came out on its own it'd still be crap.",

Instead of Michael Jordan there is LeBron James who has to work together with Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes to win a basketball match and not letting artificial intelligence achieve its goal.Since I had already watched the first movie of \"Space Jam\" I knew what to expect from this new version of it. The direction which was made by Malcolm D. Lee was average without achieving to intrigued audience and make them feel that they are also a part of this movie following his main characters. The interpretations of LeBron James who played as himself, Don Cheadle who played as Al G. Rhythm and Cedric Joe who played as Dom James were good and their combination worked pretty good. To sum up, I have to say that \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\" is an average comedy movie and I advise you to lower your standards if you want to watch it otherwise you will be disappointed.",

            "content": "I was 6 years old when the original Space Jam came out. It's always been one of my childhood favorites. I never imagined that after 25 years, they'd actually make a sequel to it, and now that it's here; it really isn't all that bad. No way will it ever be as nostalgic as the original, but if you're a fan of the original, and love cinema, especially films and television shows made by Warner Bros. Then you're in for quite a surprise. There are many nods, pop culture references and Easter eggs to great franchises such as Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mad Max, The Matrix, Casablanca, The Wizard of Oz, King Kong, The Iron Giant, Rick and Morty, the DC Universe and much more.LeBron James stars as a fictionalized version of himself. (I feel weird for saying this, but LeBron showed more emotion than Michael Jordan did in the original. MJ seemed wooden and had hardly any emotion when he met the Looney Tunes. LeBron was legit excited to meet Bugs Bunny and treated him like a buddy.) At a young age, LeBron was taught that basketball is all work and no play.Fast forward to present day, he wants his children to follow in his footsteps, but his son, Dominic \"Dom\" wants to create video games. One day, LeBron and his family are invited to the Warner Bros. To discuss a movie deal, but when he and his son get into an argument, an evil computer A. I. named Al-G Rhythm abducts them and forces LeBron to play a high stakes basketball game against video game characters that his son created. Al-G gives LeBron 24 hours to put together a team, so he's sent to Looney Tune World and teams up with Bugs Bunny to put together the ultimate team. LeBron wants big powerful characters like Superman, King Kong and the Iron Giant, but Bugs just wants to get his ol' tune pals back together.This becomes one of the best scenes in the movie. LeBron, and Bugs visit other Warner Bros. Produced films to find all the remaining Looney Tunes. I won't spoil all the surprises. If LeBron and his team loses, then Al-G will take his son prisoner and abduct anyone who is livestreaming it on their cell phone. Welcome to the jam!If you grew up with the original, I implore you to give this new one a try. I was skeptical for awhile, but when I finally saw it, I really enjoyed it and I felt like a kid again. I highly recommend SPACE JAM: A NEW LEGACY!!!",

The original suffers from many of the same flaws that A New Legacy has, but ANL has just a few more. Michael Jordan in the original movie had some pretty stiff acting and Lebron James is the same way as well, except MJ's characterization felt a little more realistic while Lebron's was more over the top and lacked the soul that this film needed. Lebron and his \"son's\" story just didn't really mesh super well and made the film feel a bit off balance. Bugs and the gang were just as entertaining as ever though and Don Cheadle as the villain Al G Rithm was pretty amazing. The overall story itself was a lot more complex then it really needed to be which made it feel unnecessarily over the top constantly. I understand the premise of the franchise in general is insane, but at least the film from 96 managed to stay more grounded and balanced with its characters and story. Is A New Legacy really that bad? No, but the flaws are there and fairly noticeable, especially when you finish the film and it feels like you just missed something. It was still a fun enjoyable time and the concept is just fun for kids. A solid 6.5/10 for sure, but I'd watch again so maybe a light 7/10 on a good day.",

It's all the warm fuzzy nostalgia mixed with modern day pop culture.As an individual whom uses social media as a huge part of my career I can confirm the algorithm really be acting like that. The villian though isn't really the main conflict though, and he plays a much smaller role than most villans so he's not super fleshed out. It works for this movie. I also loved seeing the traditional cartoon style with live action again, who framed Roger rabbit was a favorite in my childhood, the live action toons were a little off putting at first.

Which they had a conflict which Lebron always wanted his son to play ball but he is obsessed with making video games. Lebron James would have to form a team to play ball against a digitalized characters that would break the rules against basketball.Decent story about father and son. And a theme about doing what makes you happy. Lebron James is a fun addition. The visual effects and animations is great. Especially when it digitizes the toon characters. It is colorful. Fun. And it has a lot of cameos of warner bros characters.Acting was okay. Don Cheadle playing a villain was eh. The direction does get forgettable. And feels hallow when it comes to anything else.

Some characters mention playing basketball back then & even original Basketball Legend Michael Jordan is mentioned & it just felt right & abit moving to be honest because those Classic events from our childhood fave wasn't forgotten or ignored like some Sequels/Reboots often do.I was also very impressed by Basketball Star, LeBron James here as i found him alot of fun as our star hero & very likeable.I loved the animation both old school cartoon & new CGI of course but all done perfectly. I liked the story (obviously very similar to the original) about how LeBron has to win a basketball game within a wacky universe but this time the universe is within a computer system that controls the worlds & franchises owned by Warner Bros. & that opens up so much fun with tons of characters owned by the famous movie studio, both animated character & movie characters such as Batman, Joker, Pennywise & Mad Max for example. I loved spotting characters in the background.Space Jam: A New Legacy is drenched in amazing animation & Awesome situations & tons of fun. I was actually impressed by everything on screen & was engrossed in this magical fantasy world.Also we get a great new villain here in the form of Silver 'n' shiny suited Don Cheadle (Iron Man 3, Avengers: End Game) & he gives such a fun performance & hey the guy is always great on screen.So yeah i generally really enjoyed this sequel & was totally surprised by that as i thought it would probably suck & i didn't even know who LeBron James was!!!That's the great thing about the Space Jam films is that you don't have to be a basketball fan at all to enjoy these wacky & inventive movies.It was so nice seeing our Toon Squad back together & i got a nice feel of Nostalgia & the new enemy team is actually cool too \"Goon Squad\" but don't beat the Monstars of course.Space Jam: A New Legacy is simply alot of good fun.",

I am writing these words with a lot of pain in my heart as I am huge fan of Basketball and LeBron James but I can barely find any redeeming qualities for this mess. Space Jam 1 was an easy going film with a simple storyline, plenty of comedy and memorable soundtracks. It was fully aware of it's foolishness and as a result felt highly enjoyable. Space Jam 2 feels like a giant Warner Brothers commerical with too much content making it feel hollow and heartless.It seems like the director was on a mission to saturate every second of this film to the point that it resembles a collection of videos stacked on top each other making it impossible to care for anything. On top of it all, the movie tries to push messages of self actualization but the writer is simply not clever enough to make this or anything else in the film look natural. In a way it feels like a eating a cake stuffed with every imaginable candy while chasing it down with a bucket of chocolate.While I enjoyed watching James and Bugs visit the different WB franchises as they formed that \"super\" team, eventually the content became excessive. Naturally, Looney Tunes do supply some funny moments and if you are an NBA fan, you will get a few extra laughs. Unfortunately, even basketball itself felt pathetic in this movie. We all remember the Monstars from the original but here, the villains are flat and robotic with the unnecessarily ridiculous Don Cheadle orchestrating the cringefest.However the worst and most noticeable part is the lack of any kind of music. What made Space Jam 1 so special and wholesome were those soundtracks that have kept the film in my heart for years as a pleasant memory. What was supposed to be a goofy comedy about basketball, turned into an excessively long CGI exposition-fest lacking heart , joy or any sort of organic momentum. Space Jam 1 is a cherished memory while Space Jam 2, is a memory that I want to erase from my mind.P. S. I feel sorry for these \"kids\" who were the target audience.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and TV Shows.",

            "content": "When a person thinks of the looney tunes now, they unknowingly make it a synonymous grouping of all of the tunes. But it wasn't always like that, and anyone that knows the original looney tunes cartoons knows that. A cartoon may contain three, heck, maybe even four looney tunes all together, but never the entire cast! Thus when space jam arrived, collecting all of everyone's favorite loons together in one movie, the praise and excitement was ecstatic. This was the brilliance of space jam, and is one of the reasons why many still love the film. But this left space jam: a new legacy at a disadvantage. People have already seen all the toons together,(twice!) so now what? Well, how about instead of just all the looney tunes getting together, what if ALL Warner brothers properties got together?! Let's be honest, that sounds pretty cool. When you start to think about it a little more though, many problems arise. \"How do you account for clashing art styles?\" \"How do you combine all worlds together while maintaining focus?\" And ofcourse \"who will replace his airness, Michael Jordan?\" The answers: a simple versatile new cartoon style, a complex high tech computer, and the new basketball king, LeBron James. After saying all this, I understand why people feel this isn't space jam. It feels something sort of like space jam, but it's not. It's more like a ready player one spinoff movie than a looney tunes film! And you're right, 100%. I can not argue with you and ignore that and if that's how you feel I 100% understand your resentment towards this film. Personally I found a great deal of enjoyment in this movie, not just from its interesting concept and beautiful(I mean gorgeous) visuals, but from its new lead and story. Unlike many other people, I personally quite liked LeBron in this film, and this may be an unpopular opinion, but I think his acting beats Michaels by a long shot. I understand people thinking he's annoying and a bad father, but to be fair many of his faults are pointed out directly in the film, and he changes for the better by the end of the movie. As for the super computer aspect, I thought it was an interesting, though still kinda dumb idea, and honestly pesters me with more questions of \"how???\" The more I think about it. The final aspect, it's versatile new cartoon style, is another aspect I expect caused much irritation with the fans. \"Why change the art style?\" Like I said before, when trying to combine so many art styles, changing some may benefit the overall flow of the film, making it look more... \"normal\" I suppose. That being said, the looney tunes old design is sorely missed, and I felt that they're redesigns we're honestly unnecessary, and obviously I'm not the only person holding this opinion based on others ratings. And so all the main aspects of the film can either be positives or negatives, based on your expectations from the movie. Personally, I enjoyed it. Are there plot holes? Yes... and the first space jam held none??? In all honesty I wouldn't go into this film with the expectations of seeing a looney tunes film. I'd go into it with the expectation of seeing an epic warner-brothers basketball game, starring the tune squad and LeBron. Simple tweaks in expectations may make it a far more enjoyable experience to some, and I recommend a rewatch with that mindset if you felt unsatisfied with your first viewing.",

            "content": "Based on the trailers that were put out, and then later clips from the movie itself, I figured this would take the appeal and bite of the Looney Tunes, sand down all the edges, and focus instead on making bland advertisement for everything else Warner Bros owns.And it... doesn't? I mean, parts of it do, I guess. The end of the first act is all about traversing the Warner Bros. Universe, interacting with The Matrix and Wonder Woman and all these other WB properties, but it never feels like the point of the movie in the way you get with, say, \"Ready Player One\" or \"Ralph Breaks the Internet.\"The last comparison is of particular note, because in Disney's movie about a character on a network of branded properties, they chose to have Wreck-it Ralph exploit clickbait for money and make friends with a poor, down-on-his-luck pop-up advertisement. It felt gross, like Disney didn't want to create a conflict of interest with their marketing partners.By comparison, Space Jam: A New Legacy is about Warner Bros inventing a Youtube-esque algorithm to make all of their future movies. It then suggests that, in order to conquer the entertainment industry, they need to sign LeBron James and create a deepfake clone that will star in all Warner movies -- past, present, and future. The real LeBron rightfully says he thinks that idea is stupid, angering the algorithm and giving us our jumping off point for the story.I loved the idea of the algorithm as the movie's villain, and A New Legacy doesn't shy away from making jabs at problems with data privacy and digital rights ownership.This is a movie that has its tongue lodged firmly in cheek. For some, I could see how this could lead them to not connecting with the movie. A New Legacy is big on making fun of something for being bad, while also doing the exact things it's making fun of. I mean, consider what I just said: LeBron James rejects the Warner Bros pitch because he thinks sports stars in movies is dumb, but the whole movie is basically what The Algorithm was trying to make. That kind of double-meta self-aware humor is this whole movie's bread and butter, and either you're in to that, or you aren't.Even the CGI-ification of the Looney Tunes themselves, where they get \"upgraded\" from traditional cartoon animation to 3D computer graphics is played for meta humor. The Tunes look at themselves, now with realistic fur and skin, and sneer in disgust. It echos the sentiment I saw from some on social media. The movie is drawing attention to its own marketing gimmick and trying to get you to believe that they don't like it either. Whether that's true or not is buried under too many layers of production bureaucracy to know for sure, so I advise you to not think about it too hard. In that light, I thought it was fun, and it at least shows they knew their audience.Which is the whole movie, really. I'm pretty sure I had more fun watching A New Legacy than I would have if I went back and watched the original Space Jam. It's not a perfect movie, and when it does lean in to the pop-culture parade, it's definitely at its worst. But overall, it hit almost every note I could have asked for.",

The concept of being trapped in some kind of virtual service world gives the film some vibes of the likes of TRON and even SWORD ART ONLINE. But of course the real highlight are the 2D animated sequences. Bugs Bunny and his co-stars are always a pleasure, and while the animation here lacks some of the 3D shading in places, these scenes are still a delight, particularly in sequences like a chase through DC City and a MATRIX scene. That said the film did lose me a bit in its last hour when the Looney Tunes turn into CG characters (in all fairness, though, at least there is context to it).

It could be possible to do something like this, but you'd need to find all the right things.Space Jam 2 doesn't have any of those elements at all. The film is a complete mess from start to finish. It really has no reason to exist at all. If anything, it makes me wonder why anyone bothered with this in the first place at all. It's painfully obvious though that the film is trying to cash in on nostalgia for those who loved the original Space Jam film. Sure, Space Jam definitely had its weird moments but at least it worked and was fun and entertaining; much more than this film.The first strike against this film is who they chose to be the sports star. So they want to stick with a basketball player, so who do they choose? Somebody fantastic and loved by lots of people? Like maybe Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, or Kobe Bryant? Nope! Make way for Lebron James. Why he was chosen is beyond me when I felt there were other better choices is beyond. That's only the beginning of the problems with the movie though.If you thought Michael Jordan's wooden acting was bad in the first film, Lebron James is somehow worse. Lebron is either taking things too seriously or is trying too hard to be funny. Jordan's acting was wooden yes, but at least some of the deadpan deliveries got some chuckles from me. Here, James is trying too hard to be serious or funny without balancing it out.The other actors are okay for the most part; given the material they've got to work with. Some of them are good like Bugs and Daffy being pretty good. But the acting in general is really nothing to write home about. It's just passable at its best.Most of the problems with the acting though can be attributed to the awful script. The dialogue is repetitive and it gets tiring really fast. Lebron constantly saying he has to save his son or, more annoyingly, the constant gushing over Lebron James himself. I know the original Space Jam definitely gushed on Michael Jordan, but good lord does this film take it to another level. The movie has to remind us again and again how good Lebron James is, and it gets sickening quickly.Equally bad is the comedy in this movie. The first film's comedy did have some awkward moments in it, but a lot of the jokes worked well and still stand up well to this day. The jokes in this movie are instantly dated or are tiresome. Hearing Granny say \"haters gonna hate\" just felt cringe worthy and a lot of the visual gags just makes you want to roll your eyes. The only slightly good joke was Sam shooting those basketballs; it got a slight chuckle from me.The CGI and cartoon effects look good for the most part. However, the Looney Tuns don't work out well in the 3D portions. They all look rather poorly designed and facial models (particularly Bugs and Lola) look off and jarring. The other designs are fine for the most part though.The film relies heavily on a lot of winks and nods to other WB properties such as The Iron Giant, some appearances of Harry Potter for some reason, Austin Powers, or A Clockwork Orange. They don't add anything to the movie overall; nor does it serve any purpose aside from some poor fan service. If anything, seeing those characters will remind you there are better films you could be watching than this.The story overall is just an utter bore. The whole movie plays it in a generic way that has very little creative twists or turns. There's very little creativity in this film and the whole movie ends up being by the numbers in how it plays out. There is one twist that may get you off guard, but not by much. There's no sense of fun, no entertainment, and no joy. It just feels boring and dreary.The original Space Jam definitely had its problems for sure, but at least it felt like a fun film that was tongue in cheek entertainment for everyone involved. This movie though feels like it has only one demographic being targeted; very little kids, and I do mean very little. Even then, kids would be more entertained with almost any other movie than this.Do yourself a favor and forget this film happened. Go watch the first Space Jam with Michael Jordan. While that film has its own problems, it can at least still entertain and give some great laughs. This film really serves no point at all other than to be a cheap cash grab. The only legacy this film has is one of wasting your time and being an overall failure.",

Lebron try to pull off the charisma that mj that put in the first, but it's didn't worked since he an awful actor. His stale acting makes me turn off the movie. Also the animated was terribly bad since which is funny since first movie was miles better than this film even tho it was made back in the 1990s. The jokes make seems funny to a toddler, but to the targets audience it's was just not funny at all and the way story is set up is terribly awful. The story didn't feel like natural as it's progress and kinda feels everything was set up. Don't recommend this movie because it's terrible.",

However, space jam 2 wasn't nearly as good as the first. It was confusing, and the actual basketball game was unrealistic with crazy rules. Lebron was hilarious in train wreck, but he still needs some time and practice improving his acting skills. One more thing about the first was that the soundtrack was wayyyyy more memorable, which I still listen to today. I don't recall any song from the second that I would put on my playlist.

No coherence, no character developing, not even enough cartoon moments, no real laughs, nothing to keep you watching. Yes everything is cartoonish, but besides the names and facial features there is nothing reminding me of my childhood's heroes. Also no basketball (I mean real basketball). To my utter disappointment Warner Bros managed to produce a sequel to Space Jam, which is even worse than the first one (and that's no easy task).It is simply one of the worst movies I watched lately, and I am certain, that it wouldn't have made it to the theaters without LeBron's name.

Space Jam: A New Legacy, does more of the second.The concept of merging NBA legends with animal cartoons is brilliant, original, and has the versatile ability to appeal to all ages, from toddlers to grown adults. What the original Space Jam does seem to lack within its visuals and 3D cinematography aspect, this sequel fails to continue, or even attempt to include.This sequel to the original classic Space Jam somehow loses its humor and playfulness along the way, painfully stringing along overused height and race jokes, having tacky and simply terrible visuals of the cartoon animals, and containing a premise that makes just about as much sense as it's casting does (spoiler: none). However, actress Zendaya, known for her more recent roles as Rue on HBO's \"Euphoria\" and MJ in Marvel's \"Spider Man: Homecoming\" succeeds in her role as Lola Bunny, and may be the only saving grace in this entire movie. Whilst this movie receives a 4 overall, LeBron James' acting receives a 1. Barely.Space Jam: A New Legacy really just fails to embody the spirit of the first movie on almost every single line. Fans of the first movie will be extremely disappointed with this sequel, unless they're fans of borderline basic jokes, bad acting, and a confusing plot that nobody will remember.",

From a future game developer, an artist and a movie classic appreciator.Space Jam 2 was legitimately a good movie.And before you movie credics from the 90s era that probably reviewed this and are upset by my claim. Let's get it straight, it's not the classic. But the classic was catered to us as kids. This movie, isn't made for us now; it's made for our kids. No of our kids know what it's like to sit at the edge of your seat while Michael Jordan dunks the ball, remembers he was the number1 pick in every basketball game. Still our kids respect Jordan as an athlete, but he isn't what wows the crowds anymore; the game has moved on, and new players are making new history. I really think that's what the debate of space jam is about. We had our space jam in the 90s. We had our looney toons in the 90s, the thing is... It's not the 90s anymore. Times change, and so do people.It's like listening to music. NSYNC, Backstreet boys, Metallica, Korn, Tupac... We listened to that music as kids. We loved it, and would roll our eyes when our parents played something like ready for the world, feeltwood Mac, Johnny cash; because those weren't what was now in our era. As we got older though, we respected our parents choices a\nAnd we may even listen to them now and identify it as good music. Same as our kids nowadays deal with Jordan.The movie from a digital standpoint is great, the cartoons are fun as well; and there are so many things from WBs past that show up in that movie as Easter eggs. The movie takes a videogame digital twist, and the bad guys are pretty cool looking. It's what our newer generations like. And it's a mix with the old and new. Take it how it is, Space Jam 2 is a great movie to enjoy with your family.",

The voice distortion they give him when he gets upset/angry throughout the movie sounds BAD almost like they went with the first filter they came across in post production and were just like \"yep that's good let's move on\"The most glaring performance however is from neither the protagonist or antagonist but from the most important character in the movie, Bugs Bunny. Not sure why they didn't just let Billy West do the voice again as he is what Bugs Bunny is supposed to sound like. The guy they got to do it this time sounded off the entire movie and it really sticks out.I watched this movie twice just to make sure what I watched the first time was as bad as I thought it was and it is.

Unfortunately, it did, and it got a whopping 26% on Rotten Tomatoes, which is ridiculously lower than Tom & Jerry's 31%.

It's a cash grab off past glories.There is no mention of outer space in this, WHICH IS HOW THE ORIGINAL GOT ITS NAME. Instead this trash was set inside a computer (game) system. Not even remotely close to outer space.Turning the Looney Toons into 3D stop motion animation was just trying too hard to modernise something that didn't need modernising.LeBron was stiff and too sentimental. The sentiment wasn't needed. Even though MJ was the star attraction of the original, the plot wasn't about him per se. However in this product-placed trash, the movie is all about Lebron and how he's a superior individual who can still be better. Yawn, seen it a thousand times already.The family were just far too perfect too. Except for the son who created the game. He was too self-entitled. Just totally unrelatable, the whole lot of them.The video game was a complete rip-off of NBA Jam too. Didn't try to hide it either.Having the teams scoring in the thousands was just dumb.Fortunately, the kids will be naive to the original and not see how flawed the plot of this abomination combined with LeBron's cardboard acting and they'll probably enjoy the OTT antics of the Looney Toons in this.

The movie is almost like a hip-hop version for Ready Player One. You can watch so many Easter eggs in this fantastic movie. I'll cite some that I can remember or I can recognize, The Matrix, Batman, Rick and Morty, Jobs, Superman, Wonder Woman(of course with her famous BGM), Joker, Pennywise, King Kong, Kevin Hart, AD, Klay Thompson and the most stunning one-Michael Jordan(with the Sirius BGM).Without doubt, all these lined with LeBron James made it a masterpiece and of course, the performance of Don Cheadle is professional as always.For those who grow up with those characters or players, I can say we all share an amazing feeling like 'Gosh! Finally someone put all those things in a 110 minutes movie.'The group of Wonder Woman and Lola Bunny, Superman with Daffy Duck and Don Cheadle as Jobs really impressed me, but if you ask me which scene is the most incredible one, I can say it's the MJ's show up. When LeBron's team are all depressed with no hope in the half, the Sylvester said he found Michael Jordan to help them, and as the Sirius went on, we saw his shoes , we felt his airness and his power! And finally, here was the Michael B Jordan, even Daffy Duck roasted that 'we couldn't get Michael A Jordan, so we got Michael B Jordan?!'The look on LeBron is very funny, we could see his complexion changed from expectation to shocked and last, disappointed. This punch line has got me too, my face was exactly like the LeBron at that time.One man's meat is another man's poison. Unlike 1996, Space Jam made its best in that age. People in this time have a severe sight on everything, sometimes even mean especially when you try to take to flame from the legend, but I think LeBron made a different, outstanding, and impressing performance that could only be achieved by him not just in the court, but off the court, and in this film.",

LeBron is not an actor, and he knows it, and it shows. However, neither was Michael Jordan. I feel like nostalgia speaks for a lot of people who think Michael was a better actor than LeBron. They are equally bad, but considering the circumstances they both had to act under - alongside imaginary, animated characters - they didn't do a terrible job, either. Honestly, LeBron's acting was better alongside the Looney Tunes than with his fictional family.Does it mean it was a great movie? No. It was a 2-hour ode to Warner Bros. Studios and its many properties. It was a cookie-cutter plot taken straight from the original. But the movie did enough different to make it its own, and kept it relevant to the time it exists in. Space Jam: A New Legacy may not be for those seeking a \"realistic premise,\" but it's fun enough that it holds its own and makes for a wild ride.",

What some critics described as blatant advertising for other WB movies I thought was pretty creative and entertaining. The references weren't exactly to unheard of movies.

Obviously Bron isn't the greatest actor but he did fine and it wasn't as bad as people are making out to be.

Shoved every bit of IP they own into our faces (why is this becoming the norm?) in an overlong (2 hours+) movie. I was hoping for a new, updated Jam, but this movie just made me feel like Jelly.",

Maybe all the haters should go back and watch the original again.A New Legacy is a movie, first and foremost, about family - and a beautiful one at that. But it's also absolutely hilarious at times, and unlike so many movies these days (ESPECIALLY family movies), it's continually surprising.I particularly loved all of the cameos in the crowd at the basketball game. Who would've ever thought Hanna Barbera characters would stand shoulder to shoulder with characters from The Matrix, Gremlins, Wizard of Oz, Harry Potter, LOTR, GOT, and the DC Universe?

The characters are so bland it's frustrating. I mean it had an interesting start but it went know where. The Idea is good and the story could of been good but it goes no where and missed the mark so much it bugs me. The first movie is a 7 out of 10 for me because it was funny the characters were cool the story wasn't complex and the Soundtrack was really good. And the Script was also good. This film had a bad Script. Ruined my Childhood. Skip It and don't make the same mistake I did!Overall: 3.5/10.",

It has kid-esq humor that can still be enjoyed by adults, and it had a mixture of new wave enjoyment with peppered moments of Nostalgia. It wasn't the most intricate story-line you're ever going to see, but you can tell there was an effort put forward.A Corny, Fun, over the top movie...I think if people forget that this is suppose to be its own entity...it is something they will truly enjoy.

They play a silly game, with high stakes. They have to combine all kinds of styles one way or the other. So we have live action, then live action and 3D, live action and 2D animation, live action with 3D and 2D animation... every combination is there. Just like in YuGioh the monsters are real, or they get sucked into the game and so on and sto forth. So in my book this is fine, even if it has been done over and over in various media.Many reviewers complain about this movie being a big advertisement. But that was Batman the Lego Movie, Ready Player One and Ralph Breaks the Internet. They all have product placements, King Kong and Iron Giant. But they don't have Rick and Morty!Some others complain about the 3D Looney Tunes. I was fine with that, as the movie explores and experiments with a bunch of different graphical styles, like Into the Spider-Verse. My fav style was Wonder Woman/ Lola Bunny.The story is stupid. But the premise is stupid to begin with. What is the challenge of competing with a pro in their own game?

Right down to the very end with the happy, feel good ending that's just plain ole dumbAt almost 2 hrs long (115 min) this could have used sharper editing to make it shorter. Most of the long scenes added for filler are of Lebron James. He doesn't come off likeable as Michael Jordan and doesn't appear to be having any fun here. I'd say had they cut out 30 min of Lebron this could have been better paced.Lebron's son gets kidnapped by toons and their reasoning is explained to James. After getting the okay to proceed to face off with Cheadle and his band of toons we get to see Lebron animated. There's a few speeches and some vanity moments by James. That's the whole movie.

There's a lot of WB referential humor which can be a bit much sometimes but doesn't become overwhelming. Great self-deprecating shots at LeBron throughout.

There are other forums for that, so seek those out and debate and express to your hearts content.Now, with that being stated, to all of the adults trashing this movie, just lighten up and quit taking it so seriously. To quote the Joker, \"Why so serious?!\" Animation shouldn't be taken so seriously. I'd explain, but it should be common sense. I admit that I do it from time to time, but then reel it in as I remind myself what I am watching. To me animation falls into 3 categories: 1. Animation for kids only, 2. Animation for adults only, and 3. Animation for adults and kids alike (and this sometimes happens because the writers throw in little something somethings for the adults). I see this movie as falling under category #3. For those who were looking to just be bathed in nostalgia, the nostalgia is there, you just missed it because you were too busy complaining about all of the modern touches and WB placements. Bugs and the gang are on point with their looniness, and I found heart where no one else apparently found heart. This movie is what it is and what it was supposed to be - just mindless fun- just like the original was.And for all of you harping on Lebron's acting and all of WB shameless plugging, I have this to contribute: MJ was also no prize winning actor either, and the shameless plugs are part of the humor and a way for WB to poke fun at themselves (these are the jokes people). And as a bonus, the script takes shots at LeBron too.Is this an Oscar worthy movie? Definitely not. Is this the best movie ever made? Nope. Is this the worst movie ever made? Once again, no. Critiques and criticisms are fine and welcomed, but it definitely doesn't warrant the comments of those just spewing their hatred and contempt for LeBron. This movie was obviously made to satisfy a new generation, not to satisfy the older generation, and to that, I would say success was achieved.THAT'S ALL FOLKS!!!",

I see people who are great at lots of things but they sure don't get THAT much praise. A movie just shouldn't praise one guy so much unless it's a documentary.The ending with all of the different Warner characters is pretty good, however, but not great.Don Cheadle does a great job in his acting and role, also (as usual), and this should be noted. He really is a great actor, and sells the part of the villain nicely (I can't see anyone doing it better, actually). If Hollywood has any more bad guy roles, there's your guy (or at least a very solid one)!I feel like Six Flags could've made it into the movie more, besides one funny line, though.",

I don't know if it was Warner Bros. Decision or Lebrons but he does get hyped up as \"The King\" way to much in the movie. The story line is pretty wacky and goofy as a Looney Tunes movie should be and I think that's where I keep it in positive light. I personally would give it a 4 or 5 but taking into consideration it's a kid's movie and my boys all loved it, i'll compensate for that. It has jokes, basketball, cartoons and it shows a relationship between a father and his son (I can appreciate that). In all honesty it teaches a good lesson about following your dreams as a kid and as a parent to not force your kids into the same path you followed.On a side note, I can only imagine how hard it is to be a super stars kid. They have to grow up with so many expectations because of their parents.

Even when he's not around people are asking \"where did LeBron James go?\" and \"Gosh I sure do love King James.\" You know this.Here's the one moment I had a slight glimmer of hope for the film.Very early on there's a scene where out of touch execs pitch a dumb movie with star power to LeBron. It's stated these dumb film concepts, made by a soulless AI, are not a good idea. And for one single moment, I hoped that this was meta commentary, a glimmer of self awareness in a film about to dunk on itself.No.This is a vanity project for LeBron and WB, it's as crass and commercialised and soulless as the film concepts it pretends to reject.Don't waste even a second on this film.So much wasted time and effort.Enjoy your new pool or car or whatever, Cheadle.It really bugs me as well that so many people are making this about \"wokeness\" or the latest culture war nonsense. Or even their personal opinion of LeBron. I don't care about that. I don't care about The s*x*u*l assault Skunk or people misremembering a rabbits assets. This is based purely on the film I endured.No exaggeration, I didn't even know nor care who LeBron was. This movie was my first introduction to the man. And based on how he portrays himself in a movie he produced? He's a terrible human being utterly out of touch with reality with a desperate need to be validated and a massive over inflated ego. I don't believe this was a caricature of Mr. James because his acting isn't good enough to be an exaggerated version of himself.Days later, I came back wondering if I'd been too harsh, I mean the Fury Road Runner part did make me smile. But that could easily have existed as a silly skit totally removed from the film and still be fun.Literally everything else, every other scene, despite being bombastic and colorful and sometimes weirdly OVER animated, had the same flaw. They were boring. I don't know how you can have such a wellspring of creativity or at least a wellspring of franchises to draw from, and manage to make it utterly boring, tedious, monotonous. An endurance test.The first film was no masterpiece, but this is just a waste of everyone's lifespan.",

It fails at both.It's far too long and slow for a kids movie, and the Looney Tunes don't appear until something like 1/4 way into the movie. Kids don't care about Casablanca, The Matrix, and A League of Their Own. Kids aren't nostalgic for MC Hammer. They don't care about lines from Training Day. Kids sure as hell don't go to a movie for references to A Clockwork Orange.So is it for nostalgic adults? No. This movie has nothing to do with the original Space Jam. It doesn't acknowledge the previous jam. It doesn't even play the signature song. There are no clever jokes for adults. All of the properties I listed above (and hundreds more) are used as mere props to remind the audience of how many properties WB owns.It's a total waste of film.",

And the match had such action and intense moments alongside the 3D animation characters that are very good (yeah, that's for the haters of Lola's redesing, she's still good).But as this had all that good, there was only 1 thing that tooke me out of the movie completely and it was everytime Lola talked... let me explain. In my country (Spain) they decided to cast Lola Bunny with a Star Talent named Lola Indigo... and she breaks the moment that the movie tries to build, fun, sadness or even the speech in mid-time is runined by her Star Talent voice (Zendaya at least did it great, for sure).Ejoyable?

The goonsquad are very forgetable and you only see a couple of them doing a trick during the game and thats all. No soul no real chacter. All the cameos are not more than in the trailer just a flash of them getting by no lines no jokes nothing. Ow and half of them look like cheap dressed up comic con visitors not the real deal. The looney tunes are not in good shape. They only have a handull of real jokes in the whole movie. They get together (only all right part of the moment when they all get picked up from different movies) and than theres the game already . The game didnt had a lot of good action or exciting moments. Just a couple of goofy moves from the looney tunes but it doesnt really feels like they are playing a full game because the choreagraphy and directing is very bad. Also the whole part with the game looks way to flashy and fake with all the ugly CGI and all the real people badly dressed up on the sidelines combined with CGI characters just 1 big mess. The commentators of the game are 2 morons who are not funny at all and very annoying. The looney tunes look bad in CGI and made me sick but ofcourse they had to do it the lame way. If they just did the rogger rabbit and space jam 1 style it would be great but even in toontown they where to lazy to pull it off and made lebron into a cartoon. Ow and the music in the movie is bad as well.That looney tunes footlocker commercial they did some years ago and the other one with the monstarz both with blake griffin where much better space jam follow ups than this messed up movie.",

This movie Space Jam a new Legacy, I hopefully will never have to watch again, if its on TV I will make sure to skip the channel fast. You seriously could not pay me to watch this again.Saw reviews talking about LeBron's acting, and boy was it bad.In conclusion this was a money grab that was rushed together. There is no creativity, its not funny, the animation hurt my eyes and the acting was probably the worst ive ever seen in a movie. The studio will make a lot of money off a rushed movie, and you would have thought they would try to make a movie better than the original but this seemed like it was made to be worse.

But it's 2020..or so and tech is big so he wants to be a tech designer. So that makes him ripe to convince that he should join that side because his famous dad doesn't care, etc.Okay, so with this when they get through the 'toon-town' thing and to the big basketball game, there is TON of HBOmax and Warner Brothers & their acquired properties in the audience and to be honest, I spent my time identifying them. \"Oooh, there's Frankenstein Jr!!!\" while those very young ones 6 to 10 years old and a few adults watching the movie with me were asking, \"What or who is Frankenstein Jr.?\" ...of which was the same kinda thing when I watched \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" and I asked some adults \"Who is Betty Boop?\" It's that kinda film.Be prepared - all the 'cancel culture' broo-ha-ha is not there. It's just a Warner Brothers cartoon film for kids and those who like basketball, and a B-I-G promotion fest for the adults who catch onto it all. I ranked it higher than most reviews placed here because I liked the seeing the cartoons, and putting the live and cartoon properties in the audience of the big game.",

            "content": "25 years following one of the most polarizing cult classic sport movies from the 90s, Space Jam, Warner Bros has finally released its long awaited sequel. Directed by Malcolm D. Lee and Terence Nance and starring NBA all star Lebron James alongside the Looney Tunes gang, the film has been garnishing countless attention from former fans of the first movie and the general public alike. As of now, it's been going rather smoothly at the box office and on HBO Max, despite not being met with the nicest critical reception. So as a non fan of the first film, let's see how this followup has been presented in 2021.The main plot centers around a fictionalized LeBron James teaming up with the original Looney Tunes cast in order to win a basketball game against a rogue artificial intelligence that has kidnapped his son. Just like the first film, the plot is utterly bizarre past the point of comprehension, especially when we consider the massive time lap. What makes the plot even worse is how rushed the pacing is just to make it to the game, and if you're unfamiliar with the Looney Tunes or much of the movie references the writers implement to signify their new presence, you'd feel utterly lost. It doesn't help that for a movie that could easily tackle how badly artificial intelligence has ruined the progress of human knowledge within the entertainment business, it would rather make it all about the cliched and predictable storyline of James trying to understand his own flesh and blood. Needless to say, the plot feels like a failure in the making.However, as fundamentally flawed as the whole movie is, it might actually be fully aware of all of its problems. As this is a long awaited continuation from a ridiculous corporate cash grab, it never takes itself too seriously enough to allow the insanity of a project like this run wild. Because this movie mostly takes place within a Warners streaming verse, much of the plot relies on the gimmick of product placements to serve the function of James and the Looney Tunes taking down an AI. While the actual game plot gets a little underwhelming due to the predictable outcome, there are still plenty of gags and bizarre turnarounds that are too unbelievable to look away from. Also, if there is any group from the crew that clearly had a ball on this, it would be the animation team led by veteran WB animator Spike Brandt, as they really capture the timeless comedic nature and poses in the lovable Warner Bros characters that we have all cherished for decades onward. Even in CGI, the talents of the gifted animators can never be outmatched with the right amount of craftsmanship and love.On a side note, while Lebron isn't that great of an actor in his own right, he does seem to at least take the movie about as seriously as it needs to be, so any hoaky underacting can be attributed to the nature of the film more than anything else. In addition, Don Cheadle must have been having a ball as the AI during the making of the feature, as he disguises his truly despicable pettiness with a sly charming persona to a believable point. Also, it's incredible to see how far famed voice actor Eric Bauza has come in voicing Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Marvin the Martian and many more, as his wonderfully sharp range brings the characters to life very solidly. Other veterans like Jeff Bergman, Bob Bergen, Candi Milo fit right back into their character perfectly, but it is noticeably peculiar having celebrities like Zendaya voicing Lola Bunny, Fortunately, she does bring a certain level of charisma that was much needed for a character that had already grown better in other media. It's funny comparing non actors, in this case basketball players, to professional actors and VAs, but that's what movies like this are for.So even though Space Jam: A New Legacy is far from a great movie, it didn't really disappoint in being what it set out to do in the first place. While it's obviously not going to win everyone over, there's a good chance fans of the first film will find the most value out of it and even share them with new people like their own kids (c'mon, it's been 25 years since then). Unless you're more in the mood to check out Black Widow or you hate the first film with a passion, I'd say this wouldn't be the worst flick to take your family to on a lazy weekend. Besides, we haven't had this much fun in the movie theaters in a long time.",

To get out, LeBron James teams up with the Looney Tunes in an epic basketball match for the ages.Despite LeBron James' poor theatrics throughout the flick, the acting was phenomenal. Whether it be Zendaya as Lola Bunny or Don Cheadle playing a rogue AI, the film featured many famous actors who performed their heart out, no matter the scene.While the acting was nothing to laugh at, the plot and writing wasn't nearly as good. As it is a kid's movie, the screenplay featured many unnecessary scenes that present cameos and semi funny jokes for the adult audience. Moreover, in true Space Jam fashion, the story (although fun) was too much.In addition to the acting, the special effects were amazing. No matter the scene, the screen was brimming with life and color. Furthermore, despite their cartoonish appearance, the Looney Tunes look as though they belong in real life.In summary, Space Jam: A New Legacy is a fun movie that suffers from a horrid plot and bad writing.",

            "content": "Almost 25 years ago, the idea of crossing over NBA legend Michael Jordan with Looney Tunes was playing on the best of both worlds for all ages to enjoy. It still remains a classic to me to this day ever since I first watched it in theaters as a kid in 1996. The self-referential, meta humor and fourth wall-breaking gags are what made Looney Tunes memorable for decades, so it adds to keep the story going in Space Jam.Now introducing this standalone sequel 'A New Legacy' featuring a new generation of people along with current player LeBron James stepping up to the court? It's not a perfect film, but it felt like it tries to remain faithful to the original despite the overstuffed use of Warner Bros-based properties surrounding it. It's like it really wants to follow off the trail left behind by fellow Warner Bros. Movie Ready Player One and many others that succeeded at crossover films in the comic book movie genre. But despite the crossover of different properties and pop cultural stuff coming together to witness the ultimate basketball game in cyberspace, there's more that can be done. I was blown away on spotting every character and reference thrown onscreen, but as for the leading man himself? LeBron James had big shoes to fill left behind by Michael Jordan, but I feel like he did his best even if his fictionalized self does come off as seemingly obnoxious compared to a chill Jordan those years ago.The things this movie did succeed in was its amazing visuals, animation, and performances (Don Cheadle did great as the eccentric villain Al G.), but fell short on the story. Lebron's son is kidnapped and must venture into the studio's computer server with the help of Bugs Bunny and co. To save him. You can place all kinds of TV and film references or characters in one movie for a cameo, but it's not enough if you can't get a great story working. A great family distraction for the kids, but looking at this sequel from an adult's perspective? It could potentially put them to sleep easy. Some audience members in my theater dozed off during the animation sequences, but finally woke up during the basketball scene, which I find hilarious than what was shown onscreen. Anyway, it's flawed, but in no way awful.",

The story is predictable and very family-friendly.We were amazed at how the director was able to find voice actors to mimic the voices of the Warner Brothers toons. Bugs Bunny is perfect, so is Daffy Duck and Marvin the Martian. In other cartoons made since Mel Blanc died in 1989, no one has ever been able to get those voices right. Well, this time they nailed everyone. Even Foghorn Leghorn and Yosemite Sam, which I think would be tough.Porky Pig's rap is a high point. Since he stutters, we were wondering how he was going to pull it off, but he does!And why aren't there \"style points\" in real-life professional basketball??The majority of the reviews here show that people were offended by the focus on various Warner Brothers properties as part of the story. We loved it! It was so neat to see Pennywise in the crowd, or the Iron Giant or King Kong, or to see the worlds of Harry Potter and the Matrix and Casablanca as Lebron goes whooshing by them. We liked those movies back then and it was enjoyable to see them flash by throughout this film. Rick & Morty even make an appearance! If you like these characters, why are you mortally offended to see them in another movie? So weird.It is true, Lebron can't act. What were you expecting? Viola Davis level acting? It's not his focus in life. But he did okay, and the people around him (his on-screen family, Don Cheadle, toon voices, etc.) did a great job.We had a rollicking time watching this. And a big thanks to the studio for doing the day-and-date release of movies in theaters and on HBO MAX. We loved seeing this on the release night and we hope HOPE! Hope that they will continue to do this. We do not expect to ever go to a sticky-floor cell-phone-ringing people-yakking theater ever again, so having the benefit of timely movie releases at home is an amazing benefit. Thanks!!",

The animations are very good and modeled, almost perfect, I loved the 3d and 2d character models, and the crossovers with all the characters from warner was amazing, and even has a lot of reference about the nba who likes basketball will love it, it's a comedy movie in a cartoon style, it's funny and despite not having a great narrative it manages to involve until the end. With the same essence as the first movie, lebron's acting is good. Certainly worth watching.",

Also, the special effects are really cool! And it's cool to see some pop culture characters from other hit tv shows & movies, make appearances in this movie as well.But with all that I still don't know what it is, I don't know what was missing, it's just.... boring! It didn't have as good of laughs as the original although it tried but just didn't land. I didn't hear anyone in the theater really laughing, not kids or adults! I honestly can't say what they could have done different other than hire more comedy writers cause at least then it would have been funny for everyone.

The Looney Tunes were the only saving grace.New Legacy is definitely better than the first. It has some of the same problems (and yes Warner Bros is way too focused on it's own self-aggrandization) but we watch Space Jam for the basketball game at the end, and this one is great.The core messages relate to family, acceptance and being a supportive parent, and will always hit home.

However, it lacks a lot in the story, it is shallow despite surprising in its references to The Matrix, It a Thing, Harry Potter, King Kong, Rick and Morty, Game of Thrones, Superman, Wonder Woman and the rest of the Justice League, brings excitement for that aspect.The shared universe is well done, both in animation and in CGI. Warner wanted to show its potential and got it, of course it's not a 10, but it's good. Unfortunately there are flaws in the plot, for example: spoiler: it doesn't explain the real reason why Bugs' friends leave his world and in the end decide to come back.It's not focused to be a sequel, even though it has a mention of the previous movie, it's just similar (that doesn't make the movie bad).When I went to see it I thought it would be a cheap copy of the old one, I had low expectations and didn't expect much, however, it has its original aspects, a different feel and new pop culture reference, it's not the Looneys that need help anymore, but the LeBron James.The acting was relatively good, but Don Cheadle left something to be desired because of his character without depth, a classic villain, where, it has no sense for what he does, nothing interesting, they could have at least given a little sense to value the actor. .It surpassed my expectations, but not really a grandiose one (nor is it its goal), but just a fun movie that implements good references, great to watch with the family.Film viewed from the 27th to the 28th of August 2021.",

I personally am a fan of the NBA and loved seeing some of my favourite players in a high budget film.

            "content": "Screenplay is phenomenal and the plot has an appropriate depth for a kid's movie. Only negatives I can think of; LeBron isn't lead actor material (maybe just yet). Director seemed to overlook this while shooting the family-centered scenes. Where LeBron really excelled was bouncing his dialogues off seasoned veterans like Don Cheadle and Bugs. We've seen from the film \"Trainwreck\" LeBron is already a much better actor than Michael Jordan. Editing team could've done a better job on that small matter. If I'm being super picky maybe we deserved a game winning block since that's LeBron's signature play. Outside that I had a really pleasant time watching this movie. The CGI and music combination can only be described as euphoric. Movie embraced its corniness and dry humor. Even got a chuckle out of me with the expected Michael B. Jordan cameo. Eernie Johnson and Lil Rel \"basketball commentary\" was undoubtedly the movie's unsung hero. Daffy Duck referring to Al G Rhythm (Don Cheadle) as a \"son of a glitch\" is probably my favorite line. Innuendo jokes about LeBron's super team building skills are more endearing than you would expect. Goon squad characters even brought their own fun and uniqueness for each member (in particular Chronos/Dame was an epic character) unlike the original Space Jam Monster squad. The film's digital conscious theme is so appropriate for a 2021 release. You've got Porky Pig rapping, Tweety Bird dunking, Granny out-dueling father time and LeBron James being trolled by Bugs Bunny, what more could you ask for? Ending is logical and leaves you feeling warm, what more can you ask for? In conclusion, \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\" is a vibe.",

I could of done without swearing in a kids movie only reason why it got an 8 not a 10. Teaches a good lesson for families and how families are fundamental you need to stick together and support each other! Also that dad isn't always wrong or an old fuddyduddy he is trying to teach you so you succeed in life because he loves you. Also that dads need to love their kids and pay attention to what they like to do as well and get to know their kids. What kids movie teaches you to love and respect your parents? Not many anymore usually just knock the parents down or mock them for being dumb. It was refreshing to see a non modern agenda lesson being taught in a movie.Also love the shout out to Michael Jordan and all the this has happened before to make it a true sequel, the shoutout to Akron, and all the references to Lebrons mistakes like leaving from team to team. And as far as an ego movie if you watched the original, Michael Jordan was proclaimed matter of a fact best basketball player in the universe this one says greatest of all time (and they say uhhhh the verdict is still out on that one or well there was that one guy) so which one was more egotistical?Go ahead thumbs down this review but we loved this movie it's a keeper!",

I've been taking the criticisms this film has received into account and when I re-watch this and the first film again, I have a feeling my opinions on this specific movie may change)Earlier today, I watched the first Space Jam, and I really liked it. It's no masterpiece, sure, but it's not trying to be. It's just a fun experience that knew what it wanted to be. The characters were likeable, it had good, fast pacing, the animation and 2D hybrid worked really well and it was just all-around fun.As for the sequel? Meh. I actually really liked the first half. It established the idea of a digital universe with Warner Bros. Properties, where LeBron James meeting Bugs Bunny in the Looney Tunes world and the other Looney Tunes being able to access different Warner Bros. Worlds. I can understand why some people wouldn't like this, it does feel very self-promoting and there are references to stuff for adults that kids won't understand. But on the other hand, they're only short scenes and do work as part of the concept of the Warner3000 Server-Verse. Other than that, I just thought that the film was really fun at this point. The Looney Tunes all get a time to shine and I almost thought that it would be on par with the original.As for the second half, that's unfortunately where the film starts to go downhill. It's not bad, and I like how they try and spend more time with the basketball game, but it's also where the film's biggest issue for me starts. You know how I previously criticised Maf's SuperMarioLogan Movie for feeling rushed with it's pacing. Well this film has the opposite problem. The basketball scenes feel slow and tend to drag on.Whilst the basketball stuff in the first one felt shorter in comparison, I didn't have an issue with that as they didn't overstay their welcome and the film's fast pace helped this. As for this film, I feel like they spent too much time on the basketball game. It hurt my enjoyment of the film because until then, I really liked it.I also find it funny that the last scene with the Looney Tunes that aren't Bugs have them looking sad whilst Bugs supposedly dies before he regenerates in the real world a week later.But overall, I did really want to like this movie, even with the poor reception it got. It's still okay, sure, but I was disappointed.",

The cameos in this movie are great. Space Jam: A New Legacy is not as good as the original but it is still good. I love all the stuff to do with Warner Brothers and their movies and the Warner 3000. This movie looks impressive. Porky Pig is my favorite Looney Tunes character. The Notorious P. I. G. Joke was funny. I liked when they went and recruited all of the Looney Tunes characters from the different Warner Brothers movies. LeBron James' acting is questionable but that's alright. I watched most of this movie yesterday besides, the last 20 minutes. I had to finish the last 20 minutes today because I went to go see Cruella in the movie theater before I could finish this movie but the point is, I like Space Jam: A New Legacy more than Cruella. I know people hate this movie but being a fan of the first Space Jam, the Looney Tunes and movies in general. I had a great time. I didn't really care about LeBron James' fake son in the movie, Dom or the Goon Squad. I don't like modern music or a lot of stuff apart of current culture so I didn't like LeBron dabbing or the new jersey's but I am happy that when the Tunes and LeBron are training they wear the original jerseys. I do not like LeBron James and his acting was questionable to bad and I wanted Michael Jordan to reprise his role instead of LeBron James but I really like the Looney Tunes. I can see some problems with the movies but I just don't care, I was very surprised that this movie is actually good and I really enjoyed it.Overall, Space Jam: A New Legacy is not as good as the first but it was better than I expected. I am happy I saw it once but I don't know if I need to ever see it again. I would recommend giving Space Jam: A New Legacy a watch.",

I also loved how the movie transitioned between live-action and 2D animation, this movie respected the original Space Jam and the original Looney Tunes characters while having a different lead in this film. The switch between Jordon to Lebron I didn't mind (also that scene with Michael Jordon in the film was hilarious but made me annoyed a bit!) but all in all, this movie really blew my expectations away and was definitely worth the money to see this.

The effects, animation, cultural references, cameos and humor worked for me.James put in a good performance, as he did more just say the lines written for him.

Sadly, they aren't integral to the plot so don't really hold weight when it comes to giving a rating.I can safely say I will neverwatch this movie again of my own volition.

It's not wholly unsuccessful, but seems to contradict it's own ethos as it takes place and it's difficult to see exactly who it's aimed at.Having been spurned on a business deal, Warner Brothers new AI algorithm (Don Cheadle) traps Basketball Superstar LeBron James (LeBron James) and his son, Dom (Cedric Joe) inside his metaverse and challenges him to a basketball game for his release. Unfortunately, James must create his team from the Looney Tunes characters and though they do have experience in this sort of encounter, the rules of the game will be very different this time.First, let it be clear that I'm not much of a fan of the first \"Space Jam\" film, I thought that Jordan was OK, but that the film, even viewed through the prism of a \"kids film\" was unfunny and the animation work was poor. I do think this sequel, with the exception of the star, is better in virtually every way - but unfortunately not better enough to make it stand as legitimately good.When I say that the film seems to contradict it's own ethos I mean that it has LeBron, seemingly for noble reasons, rejects the algorithms plan to scan him and then have him interact with all their IP - only for all of Warner Brothers Properties to feature heavily in the film, regardless of whether the character seems to suit the storyline, or is appropriate for the target audience. This leads, for example, to Pennywise the clown featuring quite heavily in the audience for the end basketball show.That said, I'm not a kid - I'm an old man and references to \"Game of Thrones\", \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" and \"Casablanca\" weren't lost on me. Despite being a bit obvious, I liked some of the cameos and jokes - though again, not enough that I'd suggest for a moment that the film is actually good.If anything it made me want to watch some other, better Warner Brothers films again - and, I fear, that's all that the producers really had I mind.",

            "content": "I think this movie shouldn't have been made the way it was made. The secret to the success of the first \"Space Jam\" was its originality and the way it combined the drawings and a real basketball star in a movie where he could play a little with himself. Here, what we have disappoints anyone and only serves to raise money for the public without delivering a product that truly meets expectations.The film's biggest problem is obviously its script: it all starts when LeBron James, a basketball player, turns down a contract with Warner Bros. The contract was crafted by a computer algorithm that has somehow taken on a life and will of its own, and is determined to make itself noticed, even in the worst ways. By imprisoning the sportsman and his son in a digital universe, things get complicated. James will have to play basketball against the live algorithm, and he will ask the only one who might possibly have a good idea for help: Bugs Bunny. It is, as we can see, a basic script, very poorly written and poorly designed, which is not able to properly sustain the film.I don't want to be mean to LeBron James. He's not an actor, he's not expected to do a great job as an actor. I think he did a lot with what he got, which was pretty bad, but I also think he's not famous enough to support the movie the way Air Jordan did before. Maybe he's famous in the USA! Outside the US, no one knows who he is. Don Cheadle, thus, ends up being the most prominent actor in the film, even if in a Machiavellian and tiresome character. Cedric Joe does what he can, but his character is terrible, and it was very poorly thought out. Self-centered, selfish, vain and resentful of his father, the kid is nasty almost until the end.Technically, the film bets everything on the CGI of great visual effect and fails completely: if there's one thing that doesn't work well, it is the stylized and tiresome look of this film. I've acquired a special dislike for the computerized versions of Bugs and the rest of Looney Tunes. They are terrible and ugly. There are things that shouldn't be modernized, so they don't lose their essence! In addition, the film has tiresome cinematography and is excessively long, with no script or material to fully justify it. I liked, however, the many tributes that are made to the films of the past of the Warner studio: we have everything from \"King Kong\" to \"Casablanca\", with the passage guaranteed by the \"Harry Potter\" franchise to \"Matrix\" and \"Mad Max\". It was the part of the movie that I found most sympathetic and honorable, but I still don't recommend this movie.",

What leads up to this disagreement is LeBron's insistence that his boy attend a basketball camp (while the tyke wants to go to some E3 gamer conference) as they're summoned to the Warner Bros. Studios lot to hear a pitch developed by Cheadle's algorithm. Dismissing the idea as absurd, Cheadle decides to take advantage of the son's already obvious friction w/his pere to lure him into his world (sort of a matrix vision of the computer's NeuroNet). LeBron follows suit but needs to reunite the toons (already disbanded by Cheadle's program to points unknown) so he recruits Bugs Bunny to collect his cohorts for the final game which is populated by many a Warner Bros. Property (King Kong, The Iron Giant, The Herculoids, Space Ghost, et al) but also humans who will forfeit their lives if LB's team loses. Not really my cup of tea (it wasn't my cup of tea back in 1996 & I didn't come out for the Brendan Fraser/Jenna Elfman starrer Looney Toons: Back in Action either) but just as a matter of being that guy who needs to see what the fuss is all about, it's a box I just checked off but bottom line the final product isn't offensive or nausea inducing but as a product of studio synergy, it gets the job done & people plugged into the material (whether because of nostalgia for the first film) will find the same happy place here for them to prop up their feet & let their eyeballs absorb the colors.",

And just like anything we humans deem precious and or profitable to us, we want to keep it alive and keep it going but not only that, to add more to it.The title of this movie says it all. Michael left his legacy and movie for basketball and now Lebron gets to add to that. Just like the first \"Space Jam,\" this one was just as nostalgic and silly.From all the trailers leading up to this, I was hyped, and every part of those trailers that got me there, experiencing it all made it that much better. Visually, I give it a 10. The Looney Tunes were still looney! There were so many movie and tv show cameos that brought out that nostalgia and smiles. Don't go in expecting to be wowed or anything.

            "content": "LeBron James wants his son Domto follow his footsteps into basketball. Dom however has more of a passion for creating video games. One day an A. I. programme called Al G. Rhythm kidnaps Dom into what he calls the serververse; and the only way LeBron can save his son (along with thousands of other people/characters) is to play a game of basketball. Not any game of basketball though. The upgraded version created by his own son. To add to the craziness LeBron is forced to team up with the looney tunes to take on Dom himself alongside upgraded versions of professional basketball stars.Audiences who are fans and familiar with the various Warner Brothers intellectual properties would be delighted to see many of the characters they have watched before get a cameo in this film. There are literally too many of them to mention. There are definitely funny parts in the movie. The Looney Tunes cast certainly were one of those who delivered the comedic parts. Don Cheadle also had many comic parts as well. He actually fit in the role of a comedic villain. His character sucked, but you could at least see Cheadle was having fun making the film. From hybrid animation to computer graphics. The transformation of the Looney Tunes cast into 3D CGI was done well. The story was definitely supposed to be a hit. But what made it uninteresting was a combination of uneven pacing and rushed editing. The film ran for about two hours and yet it seemed like a rush of clips tied together to form the film. There were scenes that jumped from one point to the next without any context whatsoever. The film also seemed to serve as one long commercial showcase the various intellectual properties of Warner Brothers. It was great to see many of them on the same screen, but their cameos were a little off considering they were just there.Overall, Space Jam: A New Legacy might definitely please younger audiences because of its visuals and bright colors. But the story and the theme seemed to be buried underneath a seemingly infinite cameos that may distract the audiences.",

People love Jordan and want to compare it like he is trying to out do it etc. It's called a new legacy because Jordan is to old now etc so you need the new most famous and most would call the best player of current times. They even reference MJ and they clearly remember him etc. It's not like they are taking that away they are just going with a new player. Again, I think most of the below 4 star reviews have something to do with their love for the first, they hate Lebron, or they think MJ is the best and want to do the comparison thing to Lebron. The movie is not great. This movie was doomed to be hated when it was green lit. Yes I do think they could have gone with a different plot and it would have helped the movie a ton. Lebron could also be a better actor lol. Cause oooof. I watched it to just see and it's not that great but it's a movie you can turn on and watch and I'm sure kids will like it. It's a fun movie that could have been better but I don't think it deserves the hate it's getting. Again read most of the reviews most of the hate is from the reasons I said above. Just watch it as it's own movie where Lebron plays B Ball with looney tunes. They gave love to the first and had a few funny jokes about it etc. It's not great but it's what it is.",

A big plus were the Tunes living lives in other universes, great concept! Strong music selection and visually the movie was absolutely STUNNING, I can tell where the budget went. It's just bummed down by mediocre LeBron acting and a little too much flexing and plugging.6/10, have a laugh.PS.

Acting is poor, from LeBron and his 'son', even from established actors such as Cheadle. In fairness, that is due to poor characters, dialogue and plot. Utterly predictable (even in the joke surprises), there is no engagement, Looney Tune characters aren't even particularly utilised, they could be any zaney cartoon.Probably enjoyable for a young audience, before being completely forgot, and it's only 'legacy' being the one tarnished from the original film.

But seriously, have you watched the original in the last, I don't know, 5 years? Maybe it has more heart than this one, but it also has the exact same problems, at least in what concerns the corporativistic aspect and the main protagonist. So I don't get why this is bashed, and not the previous one, outside of blind nostalgia. Furthermore, I find funny that this is corporativistic garbage, but all the Marvel and DC movies are not. Who bashes those movies for those aspects?? Almost no one. Anyway, I'm not gonna defend this movie, other than some jokes that I find funny and creative, in the Looney Tunes vibe. 2.5/10.",

In my opinion Space Jam: a new legacy has the same problem that Space Jam (1996) had. The acting. Both of the main actors were basketball players.

Throughout the movie, it felt more like a reboot than a sequel since the first movie the world of the Looney Tunes lived underneath a golf course, and in this movie, they live in a self-aware computer simulation designed as an algorithm which made it feel like a reboot. But when we meet the Looney Tunes characters they mention the most obvious things in the first movie, like Bugs and Lola mentioning that they've done a basketball tournament before and all of the other Toons remembering Michael Jordan and Sylvester bringing Michael Jordan but instead brought Michael B. Jordan for an unnecessary cameo. Which makes my mind hurt like thunder: is it a reboot or a sequel?I believe Warner Bros. Relied on nostalgia too much in this movie, there are cameos and references to their movies but they don't do it right, they even made cameos of characters they don't even own like Rick and Morty, I think. I don't know how many things they own but they relied on it too much and don't have enough time to improve the story.The good parts in this movie are the setups and payoffs in it but some don't make any logical sense. The plot is good with the stakes, the goals, but some of the urgency doesn't make any logical sense as it was established before.The character arc of LeBron was a little cliche but all the other arcs from other characters were either tossed aside or replaced that doesn't fit with its thesis and we're never established in the first place.I understand that this is Looney Tunes where everything is crazy and fun but in cinema there has to be some rules that need to be followed.",

I especially liked the attention to detail in the basketball game scene with so many WB characters as spectators. Very cool.",

LeBron really need to take some acting classes, but he can be a great movie star. Using classics and putting in new jackets is about the appearance.Using old lines does not work, especially hype ones.Do not know if they're just trashing Warner Bros.Also, saying the internet is black is so unethical\nUsing classic lines and low animation that works in the 90s will not work with the children of these days, well maybe below 10\nSome lines are good, also do like how they not just put into the movies but do put some effort into it. Even short, it did the job and work.It was an opportunity to really promote Warner Bros as a power producer\nWarner Bros did budget out on using real props especially if they need to make new input, they will use mostly anime to cover that. I do need to say they did a great job in merging reality and anime together, but it happens fast, so I do not really can judge the quality of it.Also, it contradicts with the value of LeBron said in the movie vs reality. Think about social media, fashion etc. Also, it's bashing LeBron about his actions switching all the time.Ugh they changed him better but is it not better for getting him bigger? Of course that is not able but should.Like how they upgrade it... but the feeling is just not the same.Should put someone in the review of the Warner Bros or Looney Tunes.It has been forcefully put into place the characters of Warner Bros with bad doubles.The point calculation is just so vague, making it hard to trace and making it also obviously that they will win in the end.LeBron just want to play normal and not looney makes him break his own moral and values again\nSuddenly style points are nowhere?

            "content": "Space Jam 2: A new Legacy\n2021\nU\nDirector: Malcolm D. Lee\nStarring: Lebron James, Don Cheadle, Cedric Joe, Khris Davis, Sonequa Martin - Grace, Jeff Bergman, Zendaya, Gabriel Iglesias, Eric Bauza, Candi Milo, Bob Bergen, Fred Tatasciore etc\nSpace Jam 2: A new legacy is about a rogue artificial intelligence who kidnaps the son of the famed basketball player Lebron James. Who then has to work with Bugs Bunny and the rest of the looney tunes to win a basketball game in order to get his son back. I absolutely hated this film with a passion, and it was nothing more than an embarrassing cash grab from Warner brothers.My first of the few positives would be the nostalgia, the fun opening scene. The basketball elements and decent character background. The film did manage to achieve brief moments of nostalgia for me. Whether it was the basketball scenes reminiscent of the original, the soundtrack or just seeing the looney tunes back in action, it did manage to have some nostalgic moments that entertained me. I also thought the opening scene was fun and provided some decent character background. The film worked at its best when it focused on the characters and the basketball without all of the other bells and whistles. It was nice to get some background into LeBron's character and how he interacted with his basketball coach as a kid, it set up what he would be like with his own son in the present well.Now for my first few negatives. The set up was very generic, as well as the villain. The script and dialogue were terrible, as well as the performances and warner brothers using the film as promotion. The set up was so incredibly basic and predictable. Having the worn trope of having a son who doesn't feel accepted by his father for not wanting to do the same thing as him has been used so many times beforehand and didn't kick the film off in a good way at all. The villain was also incredibly generic. Think of the most simple motivations and reasoning behind a character's actions and that's what you had here, not even the charms of Don Cheadle could stop the poor writing behind this. The script and dialogue were also unfortunately very bad. It was forced, corny and never felt realistic. The dialogue was awkwardly executed, and you could tell even the actors were struggling to deliver the lines well, the script was simple and poorly constructed, it felt like no effort was put into making it even serviceable and it really effected the film. I do also have to say the performances were not very good. LeBron James seems like a likeable person, but his performance was terrible here. He delivered his lines in a forced and awkward manner and it all felt clunky and robotic, with no chemistry with the rest of the cast. I also thought this was just promotion for Warner Brothers. This didn't really feel like a space jam film. It felt like egotistical and desperate promotion of Warner Brothers IP. With no effort to even cover it up. Going as far as having some scenes within the studios really shows where the studio had there priorities with this film.My final few positives would be the animation, the voice cast and character designs, as well as the fun scenes with the looney tunes. I thought the animation here for the looney tunes was excellent, due to improved CGI and just more attention to detail the designs of Bugs bunny and co were drastically improved and it was interesting to see them so well designed. I also thought the cinematography here was great. It was largely used as a distraction, but the film bounced off the screen with its fun and creative worlds and futuristic visuals that were a visual delight. I also thought the voice cast was excellent, it was great to hear all of the original cast return in there glory, with a great new addition with Zendaya who bought Lola Bunny to life in a much better representation of her character then the original. I also thought the character designs for the looney tunes opposing teams were fun. Combining famous basketball players with different animals was a fun idea, they looked great and posed a good threat to the main plot point and the team. Finally, there was also a lot of fun scenes with recruiting the looney tunes. Despite Warner Brothers using the film as promotion, the scenes involving the looney tunes being trapped in different brands were admittedly very entertaining to watch and some of the best parts of the film.My next few negatives would be corny tone and humour. The rushed pacing, as well as the repetitive conflict and odd character decisions. This film rushed over so many things, any form of development or important scene introduced was just rushed over, never giving the audience time for any of it to connect or sink in, so therefore I just didn't care about the characters, I also thought the humour was terrible, I understand it's a family film. But the humour was incredibly forced, awkward and just fell flat. It was incredibly corny and was just trying too hard to be cool or funny and it just came across as cringy. I also thought the conflict here was extremely repetitive, having the son not feel accepted by Lebron was fine and it was clear his passion wasn't in basketball. But when the same lines and repetitive reasoning for the conflict was used so often without any form of development or just more to it, it just stayed in the same place and therefore it got tedious and repetitive. Plus, the son made some very questionable character decisions, the film made it come across like he hated his dad, without enough development between there relationship, so the son actually came across as na\u00efve and extremely unlikeable, with illogical and harsh decisions throughout that made me even more disconnected to the relationships.My final few negatives would be the slow pacing in the second half, the lack of stakes or development to the plot. The awful 3D design of the looney tunes. And the messy final act. The film was easily thirty minutes too long, with a messy and clunky final act that dragged on for too long. The final basketball match was forty minutes long that's almost half the movie, and it didn't fly by it dragged along almost to the point of it being unwatchable. I also thought there was a complete lack of development or stakes to the plot. I never once considered the villain to be a threat or thought that there was a slight chance of the team actually losing, it was just predictably and simply laid out. With no development to the characters or further explanation into the villain. Finally, I thought the 3D designs for the looney tunes were terrible, I seriously don't understand why the creative team behind the film decided having 3D designs instead of 2D would work in the final act, because it didn't. Everyone looked poorly made and the designs were frankly off-putting and worked better with the original 2D designs. This didn't need to be changed and was a poorly executed creative decision.Overall, Space Jam 2 is mildly entertaining in parts, and it was nice to see the looney tunes back. And will probably be mostly entertaining for young kids. But it was an embarrassing cash grab from Warner Brothers. It was lazy, forced and completely cringy. Another failed sequel to a classic that should have never been made. Warner Brothers, there is a difference between trying and trying too hard and this fell completely flat.Overall rating 27/100.",

            "content": "The Good: Maybe it was my lack of expectations, but SP2 had some surprisingly charming moments. The entire sequence with the Looney Tunes invading other WB properties was...actually pretty fun. Lebron James was decent as an actor (really no worse than MJ, stop pretending he was good, people). And, I have to admit...the shot of all these random WB characters all together on screen was emotionally satisfying, I cannot lie.The Bad: Too bad that this movie often feels more like a shareholder's presentation and less like...a movie. I honestly felt this entire exercise was (aside from $$) a thinly veiled attempt to show off how much IP Warner Bros. Owns. There's no reason Game of Thrones or King Kong should have so much of a role in this \"Looney Tunes\" movie.Not to mention the garish visuals by the end of SP2; bursting at the seams with reds and blues, loud noises, and complete nonsense. I assure you I am not 67 years old. I am a young adult, and even I got a headache from parts of this movie. It is not very visually pleasing.And, for God's sake, who told Don Cheadle this role was for him? He's so miscast as the snappy, aggrieved algorithm (creatively named, Al G. Rithim) character who is a poor stand in for the original film's Monstars. Even the conceit is needlessly complicated and stupid: he's trying to...get revenge on James for calling him boring by...wiping the Looney Tunes off the WB server? What?Speaking of the Looney Tunes, while again, there were some fun moments and it's nice to see them, in effect they feel less essential to this movie than they should. Really, WB could have made a version of this movie with Harry Potter or DC characters, right? They feel almost in this movie by accident.The Ugly: Remember back in 2012, when The Avengers came out and we movie nerds were excited to see the first genuine big budget crossover movie? Well, like many things, it took a few years to recognize how corporate Hollywood would drive the novelty into the ground. A New Legacy is that ground.",

I love 2D animation and I don't understand why it doesn't do well in terms of the box office.I didn't go into this film expecting much and... I got exactly what I expected. It was a fun filled experience but I felt bored? I'm unsure how to describe it. The 3D models look off at times and the acting was mediocre at best (I could not take the villain seriously). I also didn't laugh much at all which is unusual as I still find myself laughing at Looney Tunes to this day.The cameos though were really fun and I loved seeing the Tune World come to life. At the end of the day though, this is a kids movie. I'm not the correct target audience for this film. And you know exactly what I would have though of this as a kid? It's ok. Nothing more. I would have went off to watch the original cartoons afterwards. It's pretty unmemorable and I can't even remember the kids name off the top of my head, considering I just watched it yesterday.It's a good movie and a fun ride, but probably one you'll only watch once unless you absolutely love Looney Tunes, 3D animation and basketball.",

If you take nostalgia aside, it is even better than the first movie.For me, it was an entertaining movie and I just enjoyed watching it from the start till the end. I liked the idea to switch from a real existing tune world to a barely alive tune world in the Warner Bros network. Also the message of the movie was wholesome.

The concept of an NBA superstar joining forces with the Looney Tunes is already bizarre, but A New Legacy adds elaborate computer elements and a father/son conflict. These devices are individually fine, but A New Legacy lacks focus which undermines emotional investment. It's difficult to care when scenes feel rushed and plotlines are forgotten for extended periods of time. Plus, a cast centered around athletes and pedestrian child actors only exasperates the script's deficiencies. Ultimately, this movie fails to mask its commercial intent.Meanwhile, A New Legacy has mediocre filmmaking. The camerawork lacks energy despite its cartoonish content, and the visuals are cluttered with effects and merchandising. The editing pace is chaotic, rushing through plot points but milking pointless comedy scenes. The music is occasionally helpful but mostly trivial. Lastly, the production is crowded and overdesigned. The only positives here are the exaggerated sound design and the diverse effects. However, those strengths are limited by insufficient creativity and restraint. In the end, Space Jam: A New Legacy doesn't do much well and is more of an advertisement than entertainment.Writing: 2/10\nDirection: 3/10\nCinematography: 4/10\nActing: 2/10\nEditing: 3/10\nSound: 6/10\nScore/Soundtrack: 5/10\nProduction Design: 2/10\nCasting: 3/10\nEffects: 6/10Overall Score: 3.6/10.",

At the beginning of the film, the audience is also introduced to the figure of LeBorn James so that the audience knows who LeBron James is and all the achievements he got. The Looney Tunes character is also presented with their own uniqueness.The conflict that was played around the family between father and son until the ending was packaged well.The perceived drawback is the tempo of the story which is very rushed. So that it doesn't feel emotional between the LeBorn James character and the Looney Tunes characters themselves, it's only about Looney character searching, Looneys join, gather and then compete with their opponents. The dish that is quite disturbing is when movie characters from all Warner Bros. Productions start to appear.",

But it can also have some fun moments with fantastic mix of visuals and 2D animation, impressive basketball powers and some likable charm from Looney Tunes and other Warner Bros properties. Of course, I could recommend this for those that grew up with Looney Tunes. But just like the first film, I would mostly recommend this if you're a basketball fan. The movie could use better ways with the writing, but at least it was decent after years from the first Space Jam. And at least it's better than the Tom and Jerry movie that came out earlier this year.",

Sorry, did I mention jokes? There were none.Everything doesn't need to be politically correct sir, some things are better with dumb humor.And a big downvote for making Lola Bunny flat af.

With the low expectations I had for Lebron's acting skills, he surpassed my expectations. But this movie wasn't just about Lebron, the Looney Tunes absolutely delivered a great performance. They were so good, the amount of nostalgia and comedy they brought was incredible. On top of that, there was a ton of other nostalgia aside from the looney tunes which I won't spoilt but it was so cool how Warner Bros brought it all together. The CGI and visuals of the movie were incredible and anyone saying otherwise clearly doesn't know a thing about good CGI. The main thing that I think stands out most about this space jam was how much I laughed. It wasn't a masterpiece but what children's movie is a masterpiece? I can't think of any.

Appreciate the animation and the humor (there are indeed a few chuckles), and remember the fact that really, this is a PG movie and the target audience is like 8-13 year olds. You just will not get the depth and intricacies of plot that you would expect from a Scorsese, Spielberg, or Kubrick. I mean. Come on.It is a kid's movie, folks.

There are certain jokes and quirks that absolutely work in here and there isn't really any character here that falls flat. Everything about the Looney Tunes characters is amazing and I have missed seeing these characters on the big screen. The animation is great as always and the CGI works when it's needed to. The actual basketball match is great when these characters are going completely bonkers it is so much fun to watch. I smiled and laughed throughout the whole film which is all I was really looking to get out of this film. Don Cheadle was a lot of fun in this role as well.The Bad- I didn't think LeBron James was that good in this role his acting just felt very fake or forced especially in the emotionally heavy moments. I wish that it wasn't completely focused on LeBron and more on the Looney Tunes much like the original.Overall Thoughts- Space Jam: A New Legacy is a fun movie, it's not a perfect film but neither is the original. It brought the Looney Tunes characters back on the big screen and did them justice, although I'd have loved to of seen them to be more of the main focus of the story. I miss these types of movies and this brings back a lot of nostalgia. Overall I'm going to give \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\" a 7/10.",

They even take the piss with the concept that this isn't the first time the looney toons have to assemble a team and play with one of the best in the sport. Obviously Lebron is an amazing player in his sport, but with the same situationen with Michael back in the day, acting is not their area of expertise, but at least the original had the 90's charm.Of course the surroundings and CGI look amazing, and I personally liked the realistic look of the looney toons, whom was nice to see back in action after being in the background for so many years, it was a nice nostalgia trip. I honestly think that's more of a selling point for both the older and younger audience, than the actual plot. The way they incorporate the different universes and properties of Warner Bros. Worked quite nicely, but it feels a bit like an add for every other property that they own. I focused more on the cameos in the background, than I did on the actual movie. The movie is also way too long and could easily have been shortened down to a comfortable runtime.In the end the movie has next to no emotion and the \"actors\" are straight up awful. What made the 1996 such a cult classic was the way it didn't take itself too serious and how the cheesiness of the 90's worked in its favor. In 2021 this just doesn't work and there is a lot of stuff you can't get away with anymore. The only positive is the return of the looney toons, whom will always have their charm.4/10.",

A modern, colorful, chaotic kids' movie following the legendary vibe of Michael Jordan saving the Loony Tunes by playing basketball to an unforgettable soundtrack. You have everything, from nice graphics, kids oriented jokes, a modernized story using the streaming and social media universe instead of the old hole on the golf court and the hint for the parents in the cinema, that big data algorithms making entertainment might not be the preferred future. Next to a lot of marketing for the Warner Bros movieverse, you recognize that it was really tried to catch the never aging charm of Bugs Bunny and co within a faster changing world. You even see in the senseless story, that today's kids are expected to have less attention span, hence everything must be in a hectic and fast pace.But well, it will entertain kids and it will earn its cost. What it can't be called is a worthy sequel. The original is timeless as it caught the perfect timing. Michael Jordan was on basketball cards in every kids' room from wherever to even Vienna and Chicago Bulls were heroes without having seen one game. Cartoons were on the edge of dying out but still accepted in cinemas, and with \"Believe I can fly\" we have a song that is still played on parties today. Now we have a lead actor that only a few will know around the world (not talking about US), the hype is over, we have other major sports and trademarks to follow and with all the cameos and references, there is not one charming connection to the original, despite disappointing comments. In summary, a nice kids movie but a poor tribute to the legend of Space Jam.",

The colors really popped and some of the animation really blew me away such as the Wet-Fire goon. What I'm most disappointed with is the lack of references or cameos of other Warner Brother properties. Most of the time characters from other properties were just standing on the sideline and while it was fun to pick them out of the crowd I really wish they had done more with it. I think the Lego movie did an excellent job with this and I was hoping for more something like that. Overall, I think kids would really enjoy this movie and as for me I'm glad I watched it. However, I don't see myself ever giving this movie a rewatch and sadly my nostalgia for the original space jam combined with the other problems I mentioned make me a little upset with this film.",

Lebron's acting is much better than MJ's, but leaving comparisons aside, My daughter and I enjoyed it, I laughed so many times from references or lines throughout the movie and those of lebron poking fun at himself via Don Cheadle commentary. Cheadle played great kids villain, much respect to him and what he did. 1st space jam was a really good kids movie. This one is a Great kids movie, not a knock on MJ(not his fault) Just CGI was amazing, writing was better, more entertaining for adults and much funnier than the original.

            "review_title": "Not Quite a Slam Dunk...",
            "content": "LeBron James is trying to get his son Dom to get into basketball, but Dom is much more interested in gaming, to the point where he creates his own video game. When they go on a trip to the Warner Bros. Studio, they get into an argument and they find themselves in an evil computer A. I. known as Al-G Rhythm. Al-G forces LeBron into a basketball game with his own son and sends him to Tune World. There, he meets Bugs Bunny who misses his friends after they went to different worlds. Bugs agrees to help LeBron get his son back and the two gather the gang for the game.I have been waiting for this film for a long time. I am a huge fan of Looney Tunes and I have always wanted to see them on the big screen ever since I was a kid. For that, this was one of my more anticipated movies of the year just for its source material. It was the one movie that I told myself that I was going to watch in theaters no matter what news or reviews came about. All that said, the first film is not all that special to me, but it was a nice crossover between basketball and Looney Tunes. This sequel makes for a much bigger crossover. Is it a slam dunk, or does this big budget juggernaut miss the goal?Space Jam: A New Legacy is a mixed bag. The story is where the film falls apart the most. There are too many cooks in this kitchen. It tries to be about basketball, LeBron's legacy, Warner Bros' film catalogue, the big game inside Dom's video game, the Looney Tunes and the fractured relationship between LeBron and his son. There is so much happening in this film at such a fast pace, that it is hard to make out what is happening a lot of the time. It is over reliant on references and some of them are pretty bad. Did we really need an Austin Powers reference? Some of them are not too bad. Seeing Foghorn Leghorn ride a dragon in the GoT world was awesome and both DC worlds were great. One reminded me of the DCAU and the other was animated like a comic book. However, they come off as more of an excuse to show how many IPs WB has than to show how the Tunes got separated. The third act is when the movie finally regains focus and the game itself is quite exciting.The humor is hit and miss. There are some horribly cringeworthy scenes where they try to modernize the characters, but there are plenty of scenes that put a smile on my face. There is a scene with Roadrunner and Wile that made me crack up and almost anything Bugs did put a smile on my face aside from the one scene. When the Looney Tunes get to act like themselves, that is where this film shines. Some of the humor from LeBron and Cheadle cracked me up too. They know how ridiculous this film is and they give it their all. The best gag is one involving Michael Jordan. The emotional moments are unbelievably cheesy and sappy, but not to the extent of Tom and Jerry. There were a few scenes where I got a little sad. Seeing Bugs so deflated is just depressing for me. The ending made me even sadder. It helps that they are at least well acted and that the relationships between the characters are done decently enough to get some emotion. Yeah, I was into this film more than I should have been.As for the characters, I like the way Bugs Bunny is portrayed in this film much more than in the original Space Jam. He has so much more personality and wackiness while playing a bigger role in the story. The scene where he first meets LeBron and messes with him is one of my favorite scenes of the year so far. He is painting tunnels, he is tricking Marvin into taking his ship and he even says \"this means war\" at one point. He is also much tougher here than in the first Space Jam as he is the only one that sees through the villain's plan and tries to go against him. If you are not a fan of him, he also gets a couple scenes where he is the brunt of the slapstick so he is not invincible. He even gets a few emotional scenes that work such as missing his Looney friends. This is my favorite portrayal of Bugs Bunny in a Looney Tunes film so far and they nailed his character... except for the scene where he dances to a pop song that made me want to throw something at the screen. Jeff Bergman gives his best performance as Bugs. He brings this character to life any time he voices the rabbit and this film is no exception. I was kind of disappointed that Eric Bauza was not voicing him at first because I love Bauza's take on Bugs in Looney Tunes Cartoons, but Bergman killed it in this role by showing the range Bugs has in his personality. He deserves a lot more credit than he got. If there is one thing I will firmly defend about this film, it is the way Bugs was handled and voiced in this film.Unfortunately, the other Tunes are a mixed bag. The best cartoon characters in the film are Wile E. Coyote, Granny, Daffy Duck, Tweety and Taz. Wile in particular is really funny. He has no lines and yet he probably got the most laughs out of everyone. He also gets a few awesome moments that I did not expect. Granny does too as she goes up against this huge virtual basketball team. Taz has the coolest basketball play out of everyone. Daffy Duck makes for a funny coach while getting the most stylish outfit. Roadrunner actually gets a scene where he gets humiliated which is surprising because he is arguably the most invincible main LT character. A lot of the other characters are wasted though. Gossamer, Yosemite Sam and Elmer Fudd get so little to do. Gossamer does not even get a scene of him joining the squad! I am not sure if Foghorn Leghorn got to do anything in the game. Speedy could have been used a little more, especially when you take his voice actor in consideration. Sylvester gets hardly any screen time at all. Marvin does not even join the game. Even Daffy could have gotten a bit more screen time. The biggest wasted potential of all however is Lola Bunny. She is made more of an action girl than last time, but they give hardly any focus to her relationship with Bugs or improve on her personality from the first film. She is more supportive of her team at least, but I wanted to see more scenes between her in Bugs. The one good thing is that she does have a soft spot for family, but they should have done more with her character.Voice-acting wise, all of it is great from the talented voice cast. Eric Bauza voices Daffy, Foghorn, Porky, Elmer and Marvin and he crushes it. Bauza is a very talented voice actor because he can capture the voices of the characters perfectly, especially Daffy. In addition to Bugs, Bergman also voices Sam and Sylvester, but gets little to work with them. Bob Bergen is solid as Tweety. I really liked Candi Milo as the sassy Granny here. I also liked Gabriel Iglesias as Speedy and I would not mind seeing him voice the character some more. Then there is Zendaya as Lola Bunny. She is fine in the role, but I prefer Kath Soucie's take on Lola. Heck, I would have loved to have seen Kristen Wiig come back as Lola, but Zendaya gives a sweet performance as the character that fits the friendly tone of the character. However, she did not need to be the only voice actress credited in the ads. Overall, the voice cast is fantastic and they brought these characters to life.As for the human characters, they are not bad at all. LeBron James is fine in the movie. He has more fun here than Michael Jordan did in the original. He has better chemistry with Bugs and he embraces the silliness of the movie. I liked his arc with his son more than I thought I would. It has a good message about letting your child be them. Don Cheadle unsurprisingly steals the show as Al-G though. He does not give a damn. He just hams it up entirely and I loved it. He made for a much better villain than Swackhammer. I did not expect Cheadle to act this hammy in the film, but his presence makes it a lot more fun. He is also charismatic and easy-going when he needs to be. The goon squad is cool on paper, but I just do not see them fitting in the world of Looney Tunes the way the Monstars did. While the team does make for a fun antagonistic team for the Tunes to go against, the players themselves seem out of place.The visuals look fantastic. Just seeing 2D animation is exciting enough, but it is so fluid and energetic, that it felt like watching a Looney Tunes short. The expressions are fantastic and the slapstick works for the most part. Animated LeBron is a lot of fun and they did not waste his design at all. They put him at the brunt of slapstick and play around with his animated design the way they do with other characters. I wish the whole film was 2D. That said, even the 3D animation looks great. The Tunes look solid in their transitions for the most part, the goon squad have wicked designs and the court feels like a huge high stakes game. Again, the animation and expressions look great and there are even some funny jokes about their transitions such as Bugs' disdain for it. The basketball game itself is a ton of fun and every character from both teams gets to utilize their abilities to their advantage in the game. The soundtrack is good, but I like the first film's soundtrack better. Nothing popped out the way the first film's music did.Space Jam: A New Legacy is a tough movie for me to grade. On one hand, I had a good amount of fun in the theater and just seeing Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck on the big screen is a dream come true for me as a fan of these characters. That being said, the movie is a freaking mess. It relies too much on references and there is too much going on in the story. I know that some reviewers have torn this film apart, but I cannot bring myself to dislike it because I enjoyed my time with it too much. That being said, it is hard to recommend this movie to pay money to see it in theaters because it has a lot of problems that cartoon to movie adaptations have along with heavy-handed crossovers. If for nothing else, I am happy that I got to see some of my favorite characters in theaters.",

Just like we did in the 90s.The Looney Tunes are really funny. LeBron does a pretty decent job playing along with other good actors. The graphics are mind blowing and the action is continuous, so the film doesn't feel like 2 hours. The Warner world also adds a great nostalgic feeling to the previous generations growing up watching those characters.This movie is supposed to be entertaining and IT IS! Don't expect a complex storyline from a comeback movie, which has to resemble to its original, which also did not have a deep and complicated story. This is a Loony Tunes movie with some real life action and some basketball. Just enjoy it and be entertained!LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT!",

The animations were good but not groundbreaking and it was the same dumb gimmick as last time. Why couldn't it have been anything but basketball? Are they trying to target one audience? Who keeps suggesting this trash. Who wants looney tunes playing basketball. If they were funny it would have been different but the characters were legit trying to play like they're gonna be champions or something I know the stakes were high playing this game but I'm not gonna pay money to watch a looney tunes drama!

            "content": "You know for a movie with six credited writers it's almost a miracle Space Jam 2 is as coherent as it is. I credit that to Malcolm Lee's assured direction and LeBron James' innate charisma. Although James isn't a master thespian he has screen presence, more so than Michael Jordan. The film starts with a similar framing device like the first film, where you have a quasi-autobiography involving the main character as a child. It establishes that he pushed his son to achieve and he's become something of an overachiever. He neglects his son and doesn't support his passion for video games. So the film has some emotional stakes before you get into the Looney Tune world. The Looney tune sequences are a lot of fun, and they get a lot of mileage out of the sight gags.There are some clever sight gags like Wile E. Coyote and Road runner in the Mad Max Fury Road universe, or Lola Bunny playing tournaments in the Wonder Woman universe. This film is very similar to Ready Player One, since that you have various characters interacting with various universes owned by Warner Bros. I will concede that this is Warner Bros advertising their IP, but none of this bothers me, since a lot of the gags were plot specific. Alas, not all the gags work like the Porky pig rap, or the matrix spoof, but the film doesn't linger on this for too long, and part of the reason this works for me is that the film is very self aware about what kind of film it is. So if you're a millennial like me, and you have nostalgia for the original Space Jam, you might enjoy this film since this has the same spirit as the first film. Space Jam 2 is far from masterpiece, but for what it is it's a fun family film.",

I'm sure he took acting lessons and put hard work and committed his time to make the movie and it shows.MJ had Spike Lee making Air Jordan Commercials and that probably helped MJ's early acting career leading him to SJ.But Lebron's script was more challenging, it contained a serious scenes, serious role.The writers needed little more work to make the plot work.Most importantly I felt the heart of the movie was there and that's what I look for and it was definately there.Animation,2D,3D,SP. FX flawless.It was entertaining regardless what other's are saying, and I Loved the first SJ w/MJ but I don't wanna compare them, it's a totally different Movie.It really doesn't make sense doing that ....\nwe all have our opinions and that's what makes us unique right?I always watch the movie by myself first, make sure it's worthy...then watch it again with my kids.I'll do that tomorrow.So don't let some review/opinon ruin your movie, see it for yourself,\nit's Bugs and da looney Toons w/bunch of Humor!And Don is always brilliant!

            "content": "It's tough to review Space Jam 2 without considering who (and what) this movie is for. It's targeted for children, and nostalgic adults who love MJ's classic Space Jam movie. Space Jam 2 attempts to balance the line between the nostalgic, older generation of 90s kids with the instant gratification-seeking, fortnite-playing, younger generation. For the latter audience, the film is stimulating, constantly active, and (probably) satisfying. While SJ2 performs admirably with kids, it's misses a golden opportunity to achieve immortality alongside its prequel. Space Jam 2'a greatest downfall is it's lack of willingness (or ability) to be self-aware or nostalgic. A half-hearted shtick which employs Creed's Michael B. Jordan teases the possibility of connection to the original Space Jam film (wait that's not Air Jordan!), but any expectations of clever homage are aroused without being bed back down. MJ is not in this film. References or bits from the original film are extremely limited. Charles Barkley and Shaq don't make an appearance, though their TNT colleague Ernie Johnson plays significant minutes alongside consumer film staple, Rod Williams (Get Out). The centerpiece of the movie is, of course, the high stakes basketball game between the Tune Squad and the Goon Squad. Despite Lebron's stiff (but unexpectedly okay) acting, he plays the superhero athlete role admirably. Lebron's best moments happen physically on the court. The Looney antics of the animated players, as well as the suped-up video game elements simply add to the great entertainment. The game is just flat out fun to watch. Space Jam 2 is NOWHERE near as good as Space Jam, but it is a fun, positive movie for kids and basketball fans to enjoy.",

There were a few laughs, and the opening montage was nostalgic of the original Space Jam. And the people who said this movie was basically about showcasing LeBron's talent were right, but the original did the same for Michael Jordan. I don't expect basketball players to be phenomenal actors and neither should anyone. I did enjoy the Michael B. Jordan cameo and all the universe references which was a funny twist. Even some adult films like Mad Max and Austin Powers! Definitely didn't expect that in this movie. Some might call it pandering, but I guess I enjoy being pandered to.",

When I heard Lebron James was going to be the basketball star in this sequel, I was excited, but also skeptical. Even when the first looks and previews came out I was skeptical about this film and after viewing it, I had every right to be. Let me just say, Lebron James was nothing like Michael Jordan was in the original film and by saying that I should go ahead and say this film is almost nothing like the original one. The only thing this film has in common with the original is basketball playing a major role in the film. His acting I felt wasn't the best at all in this film and I felt like every scene he was in, it was like he was reading off of a teleprompter that was close by. Don Cheadle was also not at his best in this film as the evil A. I. villain as he felt goofy and distracting at times which was disappointing, because I was looking forward to him in this movie. The Looney Tunes were probably one of the only best things about this film as well as all the cameos. Besides that, Space Jam: A New Legacy is a absolute disappointment compared to the 1996 iconic Michael Jordan film. Rating 3/10.",

            "content": "Frankly, I don't know anything about basketball, I grew up with the first film, and at the time I knew the name of Jordan, but only because it was a little bit mentioned on television, an iconic name like Dali for boxing or Pel\u00e9 and Maradona for soccer... Lebron, on the other hand, I did not know who he was, nor that he was disliked by half of the fans of this sport, so I did not automatically judge him as an unfortunate choice.I found the film itself a little inferior to the progenitor, which was already a simple film for kids, with a non-actor visibly struggling to talk to the void (even for real actor it is complicated). Lebron honestly seemed less awkward than Jordan, but the film falls on other fronts. There are too many improvised humans for too much time, and the emancipating diatribe between father and nerdy son, quickly becomes annoying. While the first film, in its mediocrity, I could still watch it every now and then, of this sequel, I think I just liked the recruiting part in 2d animation.Regarding the scandal for the flattening of the chest of Lola I think that the fans have exaggerated... a little, it is true that in the '90s she had a more aggressive appearance, but she never had an exaggerated body like Jessica Rabbit, nor even provocative like Berri of \"Conker\" or the Minerva Mink of the \"Animaniacs\". Lola has been made more generic, for small children, it is true, a pathetic choice for sure, but it is not all this great change and loss, she's never even been popular. I would have understood more if the fans had complained about how sometimes, the CG, does not render his face very well in the \"three-dimensional version\". On the other hand, regarding the exile of that loser womanizer of Pep\u00e8 Le Pew for ravings of incitement to rape ... it reminds me of the silly polemics about japan robots in the 80s and against magical girls in the 90s. Luckily Pep\u00e9 has never been particularly nice or funny, give a damn, but it remains a disturbing fact.As for the opponents, the first impact is negative, the Monstars were not very charismatic masses of muscles, but their being dull and brightly colored made them nice. These new mutants have less time to make themselves known and have to struggle harder because of the grim CG.The development of the challenge is rather confusing because in addition to sports, it mixes video-game rules with Looney's follies, and computer graphics complicates things. The Rap part sucks, but not as much as the excessive citation of the Warner properties, which used the film to get a mega publicity, even making many famous characters move awkwardly in the background, worse than a Capcom fighting game. Plus, other minor quotes that should grab the nostalgic, like the wtf Mc Hammer ballet. Even some regular scenes are a bit nonsense, like super Granny against Chronos.The quality hasn't really dropped, it's just that they tried too hard in my opinion. Simplicity was the winning weapon in the first film, the incipit of this sequel feels more stupid, both for the identity of the algorithm, and for the way in which technology is superficially treated, with an aftertaste of old \"Serial Experiments Lain\" that doesn't get your brain off the ground like a couple of unscrupulous cartoonish alien entrepreneurs. Obviously, the new generations will elaborate it in their own way, but I don't think they will diverge too much in opinion.In short, a film to be seen only once, there is a certain attention to detail, but... I doubt it will be remembered as the first with Jordan.",

            "content": "This is a fun, entertaining movie. It's certainly not one that you'd watch and come out of the theaters pondering the deeper life lessons this movie taught you, it's a popcorn flick. When an athlete is the main actor you should probably lower your expectations a bit. LeBron is obviously a top-tier actor but he wasn't horrendous. Compared to Jordan in the original Space Jam his acting is a bit better seeing as he actually seems to be showing some emotion like he would on the court in the actual games like when he talks to the referees in the real games. In the original Space Jam, Jordan looked bored most of the time and barely expressed himself.I liked how there was a mix of 2D and 3D animation which shows the different era we're in now compared to 1996 where 2D was king. However this movie unfortunately represents this new era in another way by littering the movie with constant references which can be a fun game for the audience to spot and recognize characters from other Warner Bros. Properties but this screams of the movie being a giant advertisement by Warner Bros. Starring LeBron and the Looney Tunes.Compared to the original, this is a bit worse but it's not horrible. I enjoyed watching the film and got to the end. Many of the reviewers claiming that the original Space Jam was much better make it seem like the original is some sort of Oscar worthy movie when in fact it's not. Most of those saying that are looking at the original movie through rose-tinted goggles. The original was better but not by much. On top of that, there are claims that this movie is basically LeBron worship as a god but it takes many cracks at his shortcomings in his career and legitimate criticism fans have of him such as switching teams too often and passing the ball to teammates at the last second instead of taking the last shot.If you're looking for an entertaining movie to watch with your brain turned off or with others I'd recommend this movie. If you happen to be a fan of the NBA or The Looney Tunes, this movie should be on your radar.",

The premise of Lebron's son being some NBA Jam inventing wunderkind, and Lebron being the regimented dad who couldn't see the literal genius behind him was just so dumb. It was the most paint by numbers \"I think I know what kids are into\" setup they could have went with, and Lebron's acting only made it sillier.But once they got into the Looney Tune world, there were some decent chuckles. I'm a sucker for the Looney-style slapstick and some of the references to other WB properties landed, even if most were lazy. People consider the gratuitous referencing/advertising to be ruinous to the movie, forgetting their was a scene in the original where Daffy kissed his own ass with a Warner Brothers logo on it. At least there was more effort than THAT in this one.The best parts of the movie are Lebron and Bugs gathering the Looney Tunes team together. The stuff before that was awful. After, the game itself went too long and there wasn't as much comedy as I was expecting there, but it was fine. Not nearly as entertaining as the original but I'd say it did it's job. And the ending was just there. Nothing to it.Overall though I think there is plenty of stuff here for kids to enjoy and JUST enough old school Looney humor and references to make adults not hate their lives watching the movie. I think it's overhated by the weirdos that can't stop with Jordan/Lebron debates. Just take the movie for what it is, and it's not \"good\" but it's enjoyable.Which is exactly what I would say about the original, by the way.",

            "content": "The second paragraph of this review has spoilers, but the first paragraph does not. I really loved this movie, and for several different reasons! The reasons may be a bit hard to explain, but they're, of course, positive, and I'll try my hardest to explain in a moment! Most people don't like this movie mainly because they think it had bad acting, and because the movie was more like a ginormous commercial rather than an actual movie with story, but those are almost the only 2 major problems, and besides, it was more of just like showing ads in the background than like fully showing a commercial, therefore I didn't care and almost didn't notice until lots of people been saying stuff about it, and most people may not notice, too. But, or \"and\", this doesn't make it bad, at least not completely. There was still lots of great things about this movie, such as life lessons, comedy, action, adventure, other awesome and interesting things that happen, and so much more! There is even a large combination of live-action and animation with great CGI and special effects! This movie is family-friendly as well. Take a look at paragraph 2 for more examples, but they may have spoilers. The reason why I give 9 stars instead of 10 is because of a couple small problems, and I feel like the movie could've been a bit more somewhat better, but yeah.One of the reasons I love this movie is because of its surprising special effects, along with both animation and live-action with CGI combined! So if you only like one or the other, or both, this movie can be for all of them. And another, is that. In the movie, the main-key character of the movie, Lebron, goes on an epic adventure through a computer-like universe of many different movie and TV show planets and worlds, called the Server-verse with the Looney Toons characters to get the gang back together since they were separated, and once they were all back together, they later, have an epic whole-new-level game of basketball, and must win if Lebron is going to go back home and the Looney Toons characters not to get deleted, they play against an enemy team, called the Goon Squad, with each player in that team with their own elemental abilities and powers, and the Looney Toons characters using their abilities as well. So basically, has an epic and, somewhat, unpredictable plot (In some ways at least)! It is also like an enormous crossover of hundreds of different kinds of characters and cameos! This movie also has a fine amount of life lessons as well, like, for example, Lebron developing a better relationship between him and his son from certain things. This movie is full of all sorts of great things, but it has too much hate and I wished that it had more love, and that people would focus more on the movie's good things and elements it provides. I love this movie and may never forget it! (Please, God, let there be more love for this movie, or in the future or something, at least!!!!) It is NOT complete garbage.",

A very good twist that this film took, compared to the old one, is that Warner's world became more visible and in my opinion it gave it much more meaning.

The montage of rounding up the other toons is basically WB showing off their dvd library. The only realistic part of the movie is when the son realizes the Toons are going to win and he switches sides to be on the winning team. Classic Lebron James. Oh and don't mind the 100 or so Nike plugs in this movie either. They are not subtle at all.

That along with terrific CGI is the only reason I won't be giving a 1. Even then it gets overbearing 95% of energy went into the animation.This movie can only be enjoyed by those in the single digit age because anyone with a fully developed brain can't possibly watch this abomination and say \"wow that was great\". WB completely neglected the audience that enjoyed Space Jam and who were excited for the sequel which is a damn shame.

For years after watching the original movie, I was hopefully they would make another sequel maybe with the next NBA superstar of our time.In the original we got to know Michael's family and friends. Michael was portrayed as a happy, humble and as a true family man. Lebron, although realistically, was not humble, not friendly, not happy, and not much of a family man despite the movie being about his son.In real life, Lebron James is the most unlikeable and egotistical basketball player of this generation. Unlike Michael Jordan who was genuine, charismatic, humble, and didn't let fame get to his head, the same can't be said about Lebron. Please don't waste your time watching this movie, the story line is ridiculously cheesy, Lebron gets his son kid kidnapped by the villain who comes from a different dimension, Lebron gets lost in the matrix, ending up in the Looney Tunes universe where he has to team up with the toons to play a game against his own son to get him back.The movie is filled with lots of homage and movie references like many things these days because there's not much creativity in movies it seems or at least people who have creative ideas aren't hitting the mainstream. The movie was boring. Lebron's acting was not very good, seemed like he hardly tried. The voice acting of the Looney Tunes characters were fine, but so much of their dialogue went to waste. Zendaya surpassed my expectations as Lola Bunny voice acting wise, it wasn't like the original or better but it sounded OK. All of the jokes I heard in the movie, in my opinion fell flat, there was no comedic timing whatsoever. The only good thing I could think about the movie was the good CGI and animation.I think this movie would have been better made if it was either made in the 2000s or even in the future with a different NBA player. Choosing Lebron was a mistake.",

Really? Space Jam is the movie you use to make this statement? I'm confused, did people think this movie would actually be good?I went in with low expectations based on the subject and LeBron. All of the bad aspects of this movie were expected and, to me, comfortably in the realm of CAMP.The Looney Tunes themselves were fun and brought the movie up to being enjoyable at the end of the day and worth a watch.If you come at this movie expecting anything but campy looney light-hearted family fun, you will be disappointed.The movie is being underrated in the 4s right now dragged down by a lot of 1 star reviews.

He's got them both now; mission accomplished. But Cheadle says lets play basketball and I'll even use my cheat code to take away points..only once though. That part of the plot was weak. The original kept the plot simple. This one did too much. And I guess its \"space jam\" because of cyber space.. I'll stick with the OG.",

It's a Space Jam for this generation with this generation's most prominent basketball player.

Literally, anything. However, 30 min into this, I couldn't figure out how the agents of Dom Cheadle and LeBron James talked them into this project. I've loved Dom Cheadle in everything I've ever seen him in, he's a wonderful actor, but he has nothing to work with here. His character has no depth - that's how he's written, it's not Cheadle's fault. LeBron playing a fictional version of himself seems natural and engaging in front of the camera, I'd like to see him in other things, because this movie is kind of a mess that didn't need to be made. The set up takes a long, slow time to get through - fictional LeBron has trouble connecting with his son, who would rather expand his talents for coding and creating video games than play basketball and just wants his famous father to accept him as an individual. He and his son butt heads, but later try to mend fences by going together to the Warner Brothers studio to hear a pitch generated by the AI heart of the WB \"Serververse\" (no, really, a serververse). LeBron passes on the opportunity, but the AI algorithm (played by Dom Cheadle) takes offense and kidnaps the pair in revenge, digitizing them into his cyberspace within all the WB vaults. He then separates them, manipulating the son into thinking the AI is his friend and basically threatening LeBron into assembling a team of Looney Toons characters to face off in a wild, crazy rules basketball game to be held later. Confused? Confounded? Not even sure why all this is our plot exposition? Yeah, me too. We then plod through LeBron recruiting different toons and then the day of the big game - where it's revealed his son is now the star player on the opposing team along with malevolent versions of the OPs he created for his own video game and the WB AI as the Goon Squad coach. Somehow, inexplicably, the AI has also managed to kidnap andndigitize thousands of people across the globe to be spectators, along with LeBron's wife and other children. He tells LeBron right before the game starts that if he loses, all these people will be trapped in the \"serververse\" forever (eye roll). Don't even get me started on the absolute slog that is the big game. It goes on forever. And ever. Needless to say, LeBron and his son reconcile, join forces and win the game against the AI, who is vaporized, and return to the real world. LeBron accepts and encourages his son's individual pursuits and later they discover the toons can now visit them in the real world. Snore. But, my kids were just happy to be out at the movies again, so I guess it's worthwhile for that.",

Most people reviewing this movie now were under the age of 10 when the original came out in 1996 including me. That movie was a classic and remained in our minds as a cherished memory. As it should because it brought Looney Toons, which were still relatively popular at the time, and Michael Jordan who was a literal basketball legend known world wide, together in formula that was fail-proof. I feel most people already had a stigma coming into this film whether their personal dislike of Lebron, uninterest in the old school Looney Toons characters, or just not willing to like this movie because the original is the one we hold close to our hearts.I personally started enjoying the movie once the toons were introduced. Before that point, it was borderline unwatchable. You have to remember overrall, this is a movie geared towards kids of that age group in today's world. You can't take every movie so seriously.Yes, Lebron's acting sucked but so did Michael Jordan's in the original. The film IS a bit all over the place but sometimes you just have to sit back and enjoy a movie for what it is. If you go into it with that outlook, you might not have that horrible of a time.",

Just dont think too much, this is CARTOON and you should be having fun watching this!!But yeaaa there's also flaw ofcourse. I really want Road Runner to have more screen time, because he is my fav character.

That's why most reviews say something to the respect of \"Not as good as the original\" or \"Lebron is trash and not a role model\". (Liking his basketball game is one thing, but there's a whole city of kids that will beg to differ on the second) When You do that, you're already preparing yourself to be disappointed. Take all reviews with a grain of salt and realize the hidden bias that is naturally engrained.I was fortune enough to catch a sneak peek courtesy of the I-Promise School and Warner Brothers. I gave it a 7/10 and I'll tell you why without getting drug down into the weeds with this review. The movie starts off slower than I would of liked, but it's important in setting the tone of the movie. Let's be honest though, who remembers the first part of the original Space Jam, it's all about the basketball game. This movie does not disappoint. The graphics are better, the game is entertaining and if you watch and judge this movie on its own merit, it's entertaining for adults and kids.Lebron isn't the best actor, and some of the early part seems stretched and forced, but the kids are charismatic and in the end, it's a story about family and dreams.Try not to compare this to the original film because nostalgia has a way if distorting your perception.",

So of course I probably have a biased opinion but I have a feeling the people rating this film at a 4/5 are just wanna be critics and not true basketball enthusiast which is sad if you ask me cause some opinions shouldn't count, I'll also add I appreciated the dad jokes and work ethic vibes from Lebrons first main man role (by the way I'm a warriors fan). Anyways this movie was bound be a difficult sequel to even be considered as good as the original that said don't believe what you hear see or read about this movie it was made for and by somebody from the 90's kid era, lastly I think it's a strong/based on truth story that will be build a positive outlook for right viewer not to mention an awesome cast, check it out and appreciate that this was even a possibility.

LeBron James, well he whines about everything (pay, politics, playing time, etc). I feel bad that Don had to carry this movie for a bad rating payout!",

I see a lot of people criticizing this for not having heart like the original, however, rewatching the original and comparing to the sequel, I would argue this had a lot more heart to it.The original, was so focused on how great Michael Jordan thought he was, that he was the only one that could save the day. On this movie, it was not only about saving LeBron's family but also about being who you are and pursuing what you love.There were a lot of great throw backs and references to the first, not negating the first movie. But there were also a lot of great references to the WB universe as a whole. Anyone who enjoyed Ready Player One could relate to all of the Easter Eggs and could see past the anger for the sequel.I get that not everyone is a fan of LeBron like they were of Jordan, however, unlike the first movie, I didn't feel like this was a LeBron fan movie, like the first was a Jordan fan movie.

So having said that after it was announced I was not very optimistic of this film. I went in not trying to compare this to the original and go in with an open mind. So after viewing the film I have to say I did not enjoy it . It was very lackluster and the acting was horrid In my personal opinion. It made me really want to watch the first one. Lebron isn't that good of an actor and I really wanted at least a Jordan cameo. One good thing was that there was a lot of Warner bros cameos and references which I found pretty cool. Overall it's not really that good maybe a kid might like it but fans of the original will not enjoy. I was expecting a micheal Jordan cameo and I got really excited went they alluded that he was coming to help. But they turn it into a joke with micheal b Jordan and it left me with a sour feeling. Having said that I really think it was not a good film no where near the original there were some really good jokes that made me chuckle a bit but other than that the jokes fell flat mainly it was aimed towards kids not fans of the original. So I give space jam a new legacy a 3/10. Let me know what you thought of the movie.",

Do I think he's a perfect human being? No. Do I think he's the GOAT? No. But I respect him, 'cause he's a great family man and a great player. And this goofy movie about basketball and cartoon characters is just that, a goofy movie about basketball and cartoon characters. What did you expect? Oscar-worthy acting and screenplay? I think if there was a God of Basketball in Greek mythology, it would've been Michael Jordan, but it annoys me how some people act like he was the greatest actor of all time. This movie is different from the original, and I liked that. I personally think it's better than the original, but that's just my personal opinion. It's not a movie you'd watch alone to give you food for thought and make you contemplate your existence, but it's very fun to watch with your family and I respect that.",

They're both completely watchable, in fact they are fun movies.I'd say the main thing that separates these is time. We have more realistic CG animation now, which makes this movie look higher budget than the original. I was surprised to find out that the difference in budget is not /that/ large (when accounting for inflation). It's about a $10M increase.I think this movie deserves to be criticized but not to the point of completely glossing over its positives.I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys cartoons, and doesn't take movies like this super seriously.",

The main villain (Al G Rhythm) was awful.Put simply, this movie should have never need made. I bet I have watched the original Space Jam over 50 times growing up. I was really hoping for a fun, heartfelt successor to the original Space Jam movie, but all we get is 2 hours of disappointment from a Hollywood money grab.

            "review_title": "Space Jam: A New Legacy THOUGHTS",
            "content": "When I first heard there was going to be a new Space Jam reboot (sometime after watching the 1996 film for the first time during the 2020 pandemic), I became convinced that Hollywood really tries to play up the classics by rebooting EVERYTHING. Star Wars, Halloween, Jay & Silent Bob, the list never ends.It goes without saying that the original Space Jam is a Warner Brothers classic. It's a funny throwback film with a sense of fun and escapist wonder. My first viewing of the film was a smooth and unique experience that I often have with cult classics.Fast forward a year later in the pandemic's aftermath, and I'm with four other friends watching A New Legacy in theaters. Like many reboots, it incorporates tropes synonymous with the term Generation Z. It involves smartphones, technology, groundbreaking Computer Animated Imagery (CGI), and what better way to incorporate Basketball than to put a big shot like LeBron James on the big screen (in the same way Michael Jordan filled the role of an iconic basketball superstar in 1996).Spoilers ahead, this is your final warning. So let's talk about the plot. It begins in 1998 with a young LeBron James becoming distracted by video games and learns that he needs to \"apply all\" of he wishes to play basketball. He throws out a used original Nintendo GameBoy his friend gives him and we cut to a montage of James's career playing over the opening credits like the first movie. In the present day, James has a family including two sons, one who plays basketball often and his other son Dom (who loves video games) who is a child prodigy that can actually program and homebrew his own video games.James and his family visit the Warner brothers studio and Dom takes an interest in the studio software known as Al-G Rhythm, who traps James and Dom into virtual reality. Al-G takes Dom as a prisoner and attempts to use him to beat his father (the LeBron James) in a basketball game, where Al-G instructs James to assemble a team of players for a basketball game in the span of 24 hours.James meets Bugs Bunny in Tune World (and only Bugs, as every other Looney Tune left Tune World thanks to Al-G convincing them to explore other realities by being in crossovers of properties such as Mad Max, Wonder Woman, ect), and essentially reunites the original Tune Squad (sans Pep\u00e9 Le Pew due to the Culture Wars), and once the Tune Squad is reassembled, Al-G kidnaps every Warner Brothers properties (including R-rated films like It (Pennywise)and A Clockwork Orange) and kidnaps people from the REAL WORLD on their phones to watch the game, the James family withstanding.Al-G then \"upgrades\" the Tune Squad by rendering the Looney Tunes in an astonishing CGI. Tune Squad goes up against Goon Squad, consisting of video game characters Dom designed led by Dom himself. During the first half, Goon Squad outnumbers Tune Squad heavily, and as if that wasn't bad enough, the biggest letdown occurred. During the halftime break, Sylvester attempts to recruit former Tune Squad member Michael Jordan (from the 1996 film) but accidentally locates Michael B. Jordan instead. I genuinely fell for that, and I have no idea why they did that. Yeah it was a funny joke and all, but at least have Michael Jordan give LeBron James a little wisdom to bring strength to the group, ya know?So in the final half of the basketball game, LeBron tells Dom that he no longer wants to stand in the way of his dreams, and Buggs welcomes him into the Tune Squad with Al-G assuming control of Goon Squad. The Looney Tunes use their cartoon physics to make a comeback and the Tune Squad ends up winning when Bugs sacrifices himself by pulling a glitch maneuver that deletes him and posterizes Al-G, basically offing him. The movie then ends with Bugs actually surviving and walking off into the sunset w LeBron.When I walked out of the theater, I felt that the movie, while not as good as the original (for a few reasons),can still pass as mindless entertainment the first time around. It's a pretty funny movie that's worth a watch, despite the negative reviews. One scene in particular that had me laughing in my seat was when during the big game, the Tune Squad turns into a group of rappers with Porky the pig roasting Al-G, it came out of nowhere and it was pretty hilarious.The characters, while not memorable to the 1996 film's degree, were still fun. LeBron James and his family dynamic intertwining with the current state of Looney Tunes (both literally and figuratively) attempted to make a stronger story out of the original while introducing modern themes. I'm almost under the impression that the title A New Legacy can be a reference to Gen Z.In conclusion, I walked into Space Jam: A New Legacy with fairly low expectations (sans hoping Michael Jordan shows up), and I walked out mostly satisfied. Not one hundred percent moved (like with It (2017) and The Iron Giant (1999)), but satisfied. I went out to the movies with my friends for a fun night, and the Looney Tunes came through.",

Look, LeBron James may be a good basketball player but he is by no means a king let alone the greatest. This movie is NOTHING compared to the Original Space Jam with Michael Jordan. First off, it has NOTHING to do with space. It's the interweb, or more accurately, a Warner Bros.'s Server that's connected to the internet and has a very powerful AI system known as AL-G- Rhythm or something like that. Lebron James wants his kids to excel in basketball and thus, must work for it at all cost. In other words, all work and no play regardless of how unhappy it makes his family. Basketball is everything and the ONLY thing. His youngest son would rather create video games and go to a video gaming creation camp but LeBron has other plans to send him to basketball camp. His youngest created a Basketball Video Game and has scanned players using a software program on his phone. Though while showing his dad the game crashes and Dom (Lebron's Son), loses his character. WB's Studio's AI comes up with an idea for LeBron James to.join the studio but LeBron has other ideas. This ticks off Al and so Al kidnaps Dom and the movie begins.Okay, actually the movie has been playing for an hour with nothing really happening. The Loony Toons are cameo's in mostly really bad movies like Mad Max. This really is more about WB's trying to put a bunch of old movies that they've made and splice them into the Loony Toons with an Hour and 20 minutes dedicated to worshiping LeBron James. You're sick of hearing LeBron James within the first 5 minutes of the movie. Kids were so bored and though this was so stupid they hated it. Even the cameo's of the different movies were horrible interpretations of them. Like The Mask, The Matrix, Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and the list goes on. This is really horrible special effects and bad makeup of the recreation of characters.If you think you must watch this movie, fast forward to the 1 hour and 20 minute mark and watch the last 30 minutes because nothing else is worth watching. Took us 4 days to finally get through it because after 15 to 20 minutes of watching we were all so bored we lost interest. This is a VERY LONG AND DRAWN OUT MOVIE. Pretty sad and LeBron is definitely NO MICHAEL JORDAN. It's very narcissistic and really makes you hate basketball. When the Toons end up playing in the game to save Dom, they do a weird cross between realistic and animated skin which is a lot like The New Loony Toons where everyone is deformed and cheap looking. In this case, OVERLY animated.It finally had a decent moral but WB's totally missed the mark on this one and should change the name to \"LeBron James: A Loony Toons' Love Fest.",

            "content": "I am surprised how low this has scored, its not a bad movie, not even a bad space jam. It works for those who it is aimed at (kids!)I have enjoyed the original Space Jam since I was a kid, but had no particular attachment to it, nor a huge desire to see the new one.As my kids have recently been introduced to the looney tunes (via the golden collection dvd boxset) and really enjoy them, they wanted to see the new film.Although they had seen the original once, it was a while back, so we watched it again the night before.Both the children and the adults enjoyed the new film at least as much as the original. My main criticism of the new one is how long it is before you see any looney tunes! My daughter (5) was getting restless, so they should have shortened the back story a bit and maybe had more incidents of the looney tunes popping up to remind the kids they were watching the right film.The kids particularly thought the new one looked better. The adults enjoyed the story more, although I wonder how much sense the children made of the slightly abstract concept of a computer world and a personified algorithm - a very topical theme but possibly a little deep for younger ones.I think that a particular merit goes to including more of the looney tunes characters in the game, and being quite creative with the game, something that doesn't happen much in the original and is limited in who you see. My children have their favourite characters, but my sons (roadrunner) makes fleeting appearances in the original, but plays a much more major role in this one, as do many others.I would also like to comment how it's nice to see a mainstream kids film with a majority black cast. Living in a very white area, my children have asked why some people are brown, because they are so rare, so I think it's good they can see films about things they like (cartoons), rather than the all too common tokenism of minor parts being filled by black actors.",

There is no training montage, before but a small compilation of scenes of Bugs and 'King' James where they get back all of the Looney Tunes from the other franchise planets because... Well, I don't know why they're on other planets, actually. They tried to explain, but it was such a weird explanation, it was the most cheap plot device ever.So, no real training can be seen (they even acknowledge the fact that Babs is the only one who can play basketball), and a second before the game starts LeBron angers everyone by making the Tunes actually play like him (and failing). Creatively, it all feels really cheap. The best jokes are Daffy turning into CGI and saying \"Oh, I feel expensive!\" and Sylvester saying \"It's been 25 years, I thought he aged gracefully!\", that's it. This movie wasn't needed. I didn't need to watch it.And how could they kill off Bugs Bunny with such an emotional tearjerker like that? It's like they took the scene from the original where Bugs saves Babs and gets slammed doing it, but now turned it into something where he could actually die. Bugs Bunny shouldn't die, he's a fricking Looney Tune!",

Grew up with the first one and while I acknowledge that it has plenty of faults- I feel that the first movie was more fun than this one.Lebron's acting is on par with or a smidge better than Michael Jordan's, but somehow they managed to make the story STRANGER in this one. Yes- stranger than cartoon aliens challenging an abducted Michael Jordan to a basketball game. An A. I. in the basement of Warner Bros can digitize humans into the virtual world- which no one seems to bat an eye at in this reality for some reason.I love that they atleast had SOME 2D animation in this- although, ironically, the animation in the '96 version is objectively better. More fluid atleast, for the most part, than in most of of this new version. But hey- budget. On that note- the 2D Nerdluck aliens make a cameo at the final game and they look like they were literally ripped from the first movie. And they were the only 2D characters in the scene where all the toons were turned 3D by the AL-gorithm. I would've liked to see the nerdlucks in CGI for the first time!I didn't expect much and got maybe a teensy bit more than that from this. At most it's a colorful stream of stuff to show your kids with some heart thrown-in between Lebron and his family.",

So, I wish that they shouldn't have included a real-life celebrity as a leading star of the film and just focus on Looney Tunes characters traveling across the Warnerverse by saving it from this film villain as it would work best for me. Anyway, I was blown away by a cameo appearance by a pair of the titular characters from an adult animation in a FREAKING kid film which is insane to me which kids watching this portion wouldn't get it at...all!!! Well, aside from Lebron stuff...this film is pretty enjoyable and I admired how animation style from other franchises like Rick and Morty and DC marge with Looney Tunes just like in Live-Action crossovers, and it was a blast. I would recommend this if u want to just see Looney Tunes traveling across the Warnerverse.",

I know he tried to do it but in my eyes he failed as an actor. The first 20 minutes of the movie felt like a documentary to me. There was nothing special about it and well it took 2 minutes until you would realize about the father-son problems.* Another thing is the looney toons appearance. I appreciated the fact that they included most of the iconic characters in looney toons but I feel like the only ones who mattered were Bugs & a bit Lola. Daffy and Porky and many other characters were not in the spotlight. They just used coyote & mig mig jokes many times during the game and I guess the writers forgot other characters do exist too. The funny thing is I don't remember seeing speedy doing anything on the field even though he is supposed to be the fastest one :)* Being predictable is another problem but since this is just a family friendly product that you might watch it once for laughter (if you found anything that much funny throughout the movie) , I'd rather cross this one out.Overall, There are many things wrong about Space Jam 2 but still, it might bring some joy to you. Especially kids who will probably find it good too. But Warner missed an amazing opportunity for having a cool cross-over movie. There was many easter eggs and of course the appearance of other iconic characters out of the looney toons universe too but in reality, none of them mattered. I tried to not care about the reviews when I was going to watch it for the first time but I ended up having the same idea as 90% of everyone in here.",

LeBron does start the film off with some terrible acting instances including several late reactions and unnatural deliveries, but as a amateur who's had very limited experience aside from on court antics as some may say it's endearing and he does pull it together after spending much of the movie as a cartoon. Overall I'd give this movie a 6 or 7 out of 10, but I had to inflate my rating of it with all the butthurt conservatives, jordan/kobe stans, and just outright haters attempting to derail the film prior to even watching it with just 1 star reviews.

There were little nods to the original - yes it is a sequel and the first movie did happen - which was kinda cool. I thought they might act like the original never happened, but they acknowledge it in several ways. Some surprise appearances were funny, like Michael B. Jordan and the original monstars in the crowd, but wasn't a fan of a similar intro about Lebron's life. Should've done something new. It felt at times as a worse reboot of the original, but if you see it as just a movie on its own then it did have its moments.I liked the reverse of the original where Lebron was a cartoon in their world as opposed to the original where they made the Looney's more human / 3D like. The morale of the story is good, the story itself not that much, but the original also had a silly setup. Don Cheadle tried his best, but lacked the villainous traits to sell his character. Lebron is probably the worst in terms of acting, which I expected, so that's another reason I like the cartoon. Unfortunately this changes for the game itself and the Goon Squad didn't look good or cool in my opinion. Dame Times was probably the worst scene of the movie. The biggest issues I had with it aside from Cheadle and Lebron are: the lack of certain Looney Tunes, lack of side stars and the basketball game.Let's start with the game, which didn't feel like a basketball game but just lots of gimmicks and fast paced scenes to show off animation. This ties in with the lack of Looney Tunes, as WB showed off a lot their own films and characters, which I didn't really have much of a problem with since the Looney Tunes still had a big part of this film. A common critique I disagree with is that the Looney Tunes don't play a big part, which was my worry, but that's not the case at all. There is however a lack of certain characters to shine, in my opinion Speedy Gonzales - voiced by Fluffy Gabriel Iglesias - should've gotten way more lines and while's he really tiny, him not appearing for long stretches was odd. The back and forth between Tweety and Sylvester lacked as well and Taz would've thrived in the craziness of the game, but they didn't capitalize on his 'talent'. Side stars in terms of people appearing as themselves or comedians to make it funny, like the original, was lacking. A certain NBA legend in terms of broadcasting making a significant appearance was cool though. That is another reason I would've loved more Speedy since Fluffy's lines are definitely the funniest of the movies.All in all, for children probably entertaining enough, but Lebron lacked MJ's charisma to really make this memorable, the Looney Tunes had their moments but could've been better, casting was a bit of a disappointment and the basketball players as the Goon Squad barely left a mark. Glad I was able to download it and not waste a few hours going to the theatre. Since I'm not a fan of WB and given how poor some of their own characters looked, it did feel a bit cheap to make all these references to their own products. The message of the movie was good even if poorly executed due to bad acting, but I managed to sit through it, so a 4 is in some ways very forgiving. Looney Tunes saved it from being a 2 or even a 1.",

Yes it's nothing like the original space jam but nobody said it was suppose to be, I personally think LeBron James did well for his first starring role. My little one loved it and it kept him engaged because end of the day it is a Children's movie for the little ones not adults and the way it's made it appeals to children. He gave it a 10/10!m and thoroughly enjoyed it! Honestly I feel the reviewers were too harsh and did not take in account that it is for the younger generation and should Just take it for what it is.

            "content": "*Some spoilers for the original \"Space Jam,\" and \"Space Jam: A New Legacy.\"When I was eight years old, my younger brother and I fell in love with the original Space Jam. We had grown up on watching \"Looney Toons\" every morning before school and on the weekends, and seeing that combined with the greatness of Michael Jordan was something to behold. I've seen the movie countless times, and I still enjoy it to this day. As I've grown, I've been able to recognize that \"Space Jam\" is, in fact, not the perfect movie I once thought it to be. Let's be honest, MJ isn't a very good actor, the writing is funny at times, and the story is lackluster. However, the things that carried \"Space Jam\" to cult status were:A. That absolute banger of a theme song.B. Solid replication of the original \"Looney Toons\" magic.C. The authentic message and overall heart that the movie has.The same cannot be said about \"Space Jam: A New Legacy.\"To me, and probably a lot of audience members, extreme corporate influence takes away from the authenticity of a film. It felt like non-stop, Warner Brothers were constantly reminding me about all of the things that they own. There's moments in the movie that make you forget you're watching a movie about one of the greatest basketball players of all-time playing the sport alongside a group of zany, iconic characters, and feel like your HBO cut away to a five minute commercial break where they show you all the other things you could be watching instead. It left a bad taste in my mouth, as if Warner Bros. Were gloating that they had the rights to all these properties. The cheapest way to try and mooch points from your audience is to hit them with non-stop nostalgia instead of coming up with original scenes. Instead of trying to etch iconic moments into the \"Looney Toons\" lore, they just throw out the \"Foghorn Leghorn is in Game of Thrones gag\" or \"Speedy Gonzales and Granny are in The Matrix gag.\" Frankly, it's insulting and cheap to try and act as though those jokes are funny or original. Those properties have been parodied millions of times, and by adding on to the pile, you're just beating a dead horse.In the original \"Space Jam\", Michael Jordan has a great chemistry with the toons. While it is a bit silly and cheesy at times, it absolutely captures the essence of \"Looney Toons.\" The jokes are genuinely funny and it feels as though there is substance there, with or without Jordan. In the original, the Toons have quotable moments that have stuck with me for years. However in this movie, the Toons lack their iconic personalities except for in little, forgettable bursts. There isn't a single moment or quote from the toons that I remember, and I just watched the movie 30 minutes ago. I felt genuinely robbed of seeing some of my all-time favorite characters come back to life on screen. Just because Bugs Bunny says \"Eh... what's up, Doc?\" doesn't make him Bugs Bunny. It felt like nothing more than a shallow interpretation of the characters that are so profound and lovable. The original was Michael Jordan AND The Looney Toons. This movie is LeBron James (and the Looney Toons are kind of, sort of around.)The message portrayed in \"Space Jam\" was genuine. People idolized \"His Airness.\" He's one of the, if not the, most prolific athletes in American History. There is a reason the phrase \"Be Like Mike\" was used. People wanted to be like Michael Jordan. He's successful, charismatic, and the definition of a man who would do anything to push his team to the top. The Toons come to find out that they can't beat the MonStars if they try and replicate Jordan, but instead find themselves discovering the individual things that make them unique and special to access their true strengths. The message was to believe in yourself and be confident in your own abilities to be the best person that you can be. The movie never directly spelled it out for you, but even as a child, I fully understood the message. I think the writers for \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\" wanted to make the message as clear as possible, because it was though every five minutes there was some dialogue about 'I don't want to play basketball! I want to be a gamer!\" or LeBron saying something about fundamentals and making his kid do something he didn't want to do. Being hit over the head with the message the entire movie really doesn't make me appreciate the lesson that they're trying to sell.To say this movie was unwatchable is false. It's no masterpiece, and it certainly isn't the original, but it has it's enjoyable moments. I found that there was little moments that made me genuinely smile or laugh. LeBron poked some fun at himself here and there in reference to old memes which were funny at times. I've seen a lot of people in these reviews talking about how \"LeBron is the worst actor they've ever seen\" and things like that. No, LeBron doesn't give an Oscar worthy performance in this movie. But, if you look back to the original, neither does Michael Jordan. It's not really about that, and to me, it's unfair to judge either of these movies based on the performances of James or Jordan.As a fan of the original, I will most likely be seeing this movie again. I'll put it bluntly. The story is uninteresting, the writing is mediocre at best, and the corporatism is so blatant that it's nauseating. It's not a good movie. There was more times I laughed because of something cringeworthy over something legitimately funny that happened in the movie. Would I say it was a bad experience? No. Even though many of the aspects of a good movie were missing, when you watch this movie, you can honestly tell how much fun LeBron, Don Cheadle, and co. Are having during the production. Don't take it too seriously, and you might find yourself enjoying the experience like I did.Just a few recommendations:A. Don't see this movie in theaters. Watch it at home with friends or people who enjoyed the original. Being able to poke fun at some of the cringeworthy moments really added to my experience.B. Keep at least five bottles of Pepto Bismol on standby, just in case the sheer amount of cheap nostalgia goes straight to your stomach.Bonus points for the \"Big Chungus\" joke. The meme is beyond dead, but I respect that you left it in there.4/10.",

This is not just in a few key scenes, this is throughout the majority of the entire friggen movie! Even characters doing the talking or main action are often blurred out with focus placed on someone else. As if we're only allowed to pay attention to that character that's in focus and noone else.

The story is ok, i mean obviously its unreal and whatever but c'mon its the Looney Tunes, i mean taking into consideration the original one, both stories are completely unrealistic and what else. However, i dont go watching cartoons expecting and inch of reality and sense. I go to have a good laugh and have a great time and that is precisely what it delivers.Lebrons acting was ok, Jordan had more charisma yeah but LB performance is not bad. The rest of the characters are well done, specially his son Dom, i think he was also quite good and other family members had a coulpe of funny jokes and situations. Don Cheadle was great as the bad guy, he gave it all and was very pleased with the acting in general.Now for the laughs and jokes, i personally liked them a lot. I liked the fact that they placed the movie inside the Warner Bros universe, which compiles movies and subjects like DC, Harry Potter, Matrix, and Casablanca, to name a few. I had a laugh with the scenes involving the Looney Tunes appearing in all those classics, we all have watched over and over, it was very original and a good twist. The effects of course are waay better than the last one, the 3d models looked amazingly great.To finalize, i was very glad with the overall message of the story, which revolved around LB accepting the fact that his kid is different and that all passions are worth it. I think it is very meaningfull in this day and age, when we have kids more focused on electronics and videogames and we adults criticize them, just like our parents critisized us in their time. However, as LB puts it \"you do you\". I personally identified myself with LB and his son; when the 1st one came out i was a little Dom living on my world doing my things, now i feel like a LB trying to guide the youngers to my mentality and all, and it is here where we forget how we where the same, its all a cycle. In the end what matters most is family, and loving each other. The movie pictured this issue beatifully, it made me tear up a bit tbh.Anyways, ignore what other say, the movie is very enjoyable and has a great message. Take your kids with you or your siblings cousings, whatever. They will enjoy it and you might learn something about yourself too. Not as good as the original but still worth it. 7/10.",

            "content": "I personally find this a very difficult movie to summarise. It's really not good, but there are some entertaining aspects and ideas here despite what many reviews are saying. Yes, it is true it's basically a 2 hour ad for WB, but their visiting the various franchises to find the Looney Tunes was a nice idea - the problem I had was that this part was far too rushed and just not funny. The execution is a mess. There's just too much going on. It flits from franchise to franchise and it's just tiresome. You can tell the people in charge of the visuals and animation tried hard, but it feels exhausting to watch.There were surprisingly few moments involving the Looney Tunes that I cringed at, but at the same time they weren't particularly memorable either. In fact, they kind of felt like an afterthought as they're not directly involved in the main plot. Whereas in the first movie they need Michael Jordan to help them, here they just happen to be LeBron's team for no real reason. Speaking of LeBron, he's about as charismatic as a brick. No, Michael Jordan wasn't outstanding, but he at least had some screen presence. LeBron's acting is dreadful, and that includes his voice acting. He's just a complete and utter bore to watch, and just not entertaining enough to carry the movie. There were some amusing moments here and there, but this movie takes itself too seriously. The first movie is a lot simpler but I prefer it that way - it pokes fun at itself and the actors looked to have a good time. This movie was visually chaotic, and it all seemed so lifeless and fake. It had a needlessly convoluted plot that made no sense, and it was far too long. At almost 2 hours in length, I wish they'd have spent more time on introducing the Looney Tunes characters than the tedious basketball game itself. It's basically a big, soulless cash-grab with some funny moments.There was more 2D animation than I was expecting, and this was nice to see, but the movie overall was lacklustre. It very obviously had a much larger budget than the original, but that definitely doesn't make it a better movie. If you see this movie at all, see it for the visuals and animation. Otherwise, it's pretty terrible.Oh, and I'm also confused as to why they didn't have Bob Bergen voice Porky Pig in this movie. The guy who replaced him is okay, but Bergen's Porky is by far the best. It's just odd to me since Bergen is in the movie voicing Tweety when Porky is his speciality.",

Maybe it is because I was with my 6 year old daughter, who I constantly observed laughing and smiling from ear to ear while chomping on gummy bears, but I personally felt very entertained the whole time. The filmmakers really did a great job stuffing in \"adult jokes\" and throwbacks to the original. Not to mention the bright yellow suited 'Mask' character....what a fun treat.In summary, is it as good as Space Jam from 1996?? This \"old man\" says no. But is it worth checking out?

There isn't much else bad about this movie other than the name of their little Warnerverse being called a serververse, Warnerverse is a better name. The advertisements are barely even noticeable, but the way they talk about Warner brothers and the way it is a Warner brothers movie is just discomforting. The movie is unrealistic in the way that their bodies disappear when they go into a virtual world, and they are just sucked in through their simple phones camera. Other than those things the movie is mostly fine, a little cheesy in some parts but what movie isn't.",

            "content": "It appears my feelings about this Space Jam are not exactly shared among quite a few users on this site, but I actually loved it. Does my love for LeBron bring a little bias to this? Sure it does, but no more than the back in the day Space Jam had people (myself included) wide eyed and holding our breath to see the basketball phenom of that time, Jordan, play himself alongside an equally preeminent cast of Looney Tune characters. I have seen more than a few comments about LeBron's acting and let's just say he's no DeNiro, but I also find it silly that people were expecting him to be. Jordan was awkward and clumsy with his delivery of lines in the original and, let's be honest, struggled even in commercials for taggless Hanes tees. That really was not the point though of Space Jam and mattered as little then as it does in this latest revival. LeBron actually does a surprisingly good job and in my opinion has better acting chops overall. Many have also pointed out the amount of advertising...and oh yes...it is shameless in this one as it seems someone got a bonus in the writing room for how many times they could put the words Warner Brothers in the script. But the first was no innocent and was borne literally out of a commercial for Nike. The plot is cute and relatable, although any sports fan might find it implausible being LeBron's son and not wanting to take advantage of that elite coaching. But, I digress. It is a self promoting studio project and has the feel of one as a steady stream of film critics have pointed out and so it relies heavily on people's good memories of Looney Tunes, childhood movie character cameos, and the hope we are all giddy to see how many we know and cheering when we see our childhood faves. At 50, though, I guess I am at the age where I actually found that enjoyable and nostalgic. One downside is the heavy use of CG which make the aesthetic kind of rough compared to the 2d moments, but Don Cheadle as AI G. Rhythm, King of the Serververse, is so good it makes you forget a little. This movie is family friendly for sure and it features not only other NBA stars like Anthony Davis, but it has some WNBA stars like Diana Taurasi as well. It was truly fun revisiting this basketball-tune wonderland again.",

            "content": "Well, that movie wasn't as bad as the others are saying but it's not going to win any oscars anytime soon either. The movie is ludicrous as to be expected, as the plot is razor thin, but if you just came to watch just the Looney Tunes like I did and just wanted to see how this one fairs to the original then you might actually be able to enjoy the movie a bit.The Plot: What plot? The plot is so barebones that it might as well not exist. If you've seen the trailers then you know what to expect because there's no twists or turns to speak of at all. LeBron goes to a Warner Bros. Meeting, they pitch him to be the face of the brand, he doesn't like fun CGI, his son gets abducted because he's smart, and to win him back from Don Cheadle he has to get the Looney Tunes back in action. That's it. The plot is actually funnier if you imagine the woman playing his wife in this movie as just Michael Burnham going into a Looney Tunes holodeck program. The story stunk so bad that when my co-worker asked if it was worth watching, she told me that I wasn't selling her the movie well enough to go see it.What I Liked: I liked the cameos of the various Warner Bros. Brands including Superman, Wonder Woman, and even Rick and Morty (didn't know they belong to them?). The Tune Squad broke up since the first film and went to the other brands to branch out on their own, leaving Bugs by himself in the Looney Tunes world (Daffy is in Metropolis, Speedy and Granny in the Matrix, Lola in Themyscira, etc.) There's also the hilarious puns on the Goon Squad antagonists (Klay Thompson as the splash man and Damian Lillard as a time god with Dame Time were my favorites.) LeBron himself is even parodied as being all work no play (even though anyone who watches him can see that he plays with finesse), and they poke fun at the fact that he's obsessed with forming superteams and that he's always abandoning his old ones if they're not good enough.What I Didn't Like: There's an awful lot of pandering for LeBron, so much that it'd make MJ blush. He's constantly referred to as the king and the antagonist wants to merge with him or something solely because of said title. At one point someone refers to him as the greatest athlete in the world (I respect LeBron and love his athleticism but, c'mon). The CGI Looney Tunes were a bit creepy to look at when I first saw them in the trailers and even in the movie I still didn't like them (they didn't like their look either which I found amusing). Also for a kid's film there's quite a bit of swearing so you've been warned. The acting from everyone except the Tunes was awful.What I Thought Was Weird: Zendaya as Lola was a weird casting choice but she did a good job regardless so can't really complain. Pepe Le Pew missing will always get me upset and it still feels weird that he's absent because the cancel culture didn't like him. Also Ernie Johnson as a play-by-play commentator (did Kevin Harlan and Marv Albert turn this role down?) Don't expect a cameo from Jordan or any other player from the original film.The Verdict: If you liked the first Space Jam, chances are you'll either like or dislike this one. Don't expect anything mind blowing (except for maybe how dumb the plot is), and just watch the Looney Tunes do their thing, and you'll be just fine. At least I can wash my Space Jam shirts now.",

At least Michael Jordan showed some emotion in the first film. LeBron is only in it for the paycheck. The plot is a bit wacky, as it involves LeBron James signing a deal for a movie with Warner Bros, but his \"son\" gets kidnapped by WB Studios's AI named Al-G. Then LeBron teams up with the Tunes to save his son. The plot is messy and inconsistent with the first film as the Tunes have to learn how to play basketball again.Also, get ready for the references Warner Bros is gonna throw at you in this movie. They try to copy scenes from the first movie such as bringing in Bill Murray as a cameo, but it feels shallow and a shameless copy/paste.The only joke that I did find funny is the Michael B. Jordan scene. That did receive a chuckle from me.Not a good film and honestly do not waste your time with this one. Go watch the first film instead.",

I think this movie would be great for KIDS. Some cheap laughs that keep them entertained, but nothing beyond that. I loved the original one as I grew up watching that movie time after time. This did not live up to that expectation, HOWEVER. I think people are being alittle too harsh on it. We can all agree that lebron is definitely not an actor, and his acting skills serves as easy ammunition for the lebron haters out there to chop this movie up. I'm no lebron fanatic OR a hater, I just think people are letting their emotions take over their review of the whole movie. Again this was not a great movie nor would I want to watch it again, I just don't think it's as bad as everyone is making it sound. BTW yes, there is a lot of obvious advertising lol. I personally don't care too much, but it seems to get under a lot of peoples skin.",

It's just shoved down our throats for the sole purpose of exalting LeBron James. It felt like a cash grab and yet another example of James trying to match up with the legacy of Jordan, but failing miserably, and I'm not even a fan of Jordan.",

They did butcher Lola, Granny, and Marvin severely but outside of those three the Looney Tunes maintained their charm and cuteness they've historically had.Had the movie not made Lebron's child the antagonist and romanticized Lebron the entire time it would have been significantly more enjoyable and as a result of that I can't justify giving this film more than a 4/10.Lebron was cocky, awkwardly romanticized and put on a pedestal the entire film.. this wasn't the case with Michael Jordan in the original and that's why he was so fun to have in the film. In the original Michael was just \"He's great!\" \"We want to learn from you\" and besides that it was focused on EVERYONE and their importance.",

It's not the best movie ever, it's not amazing an incredible but it was joyful it was fun! I had a lot of fun and to me, that makes for a good movie. There are movies that are meant to put a lot of focus on, movies that are well Oscar worthy, attention to the story but this isn't one of those films, this is a film where you can just sit back grab your snacks, lay back forget about all the crisis in this world and have a great time!",

My kids loved it (aged 9 and 6) and it kept me entertained too (45).Ok Lebron James is not the best actor in the world but he was likeable and definitely not cringe-worthy. The musical numbers were great fun and got my kids tapping their feet. They were thoroughly entertained throughout, often laughing out loud, and we all came away from the movie buzzing.If that's not a sign of a good movie - I don't know what is.",

There are lots of inside jokes within the movie that reference to other WB movies & basketball (obviously).Brons acting was okay. The storyline of movie was also okay. I loved the pop culture references and the digs movie had at LeBron. It was nice and easy to watch. I wasn't the biggest fan of how they changed up the basketball storyline when it turned into bonus points etc but I'm a gamer so I didn't actually mind it as much.Overall, I'm happy that I saw it and enjoyed it but I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again.",

            "content": "Marion D. Ray (marionray76@gmailcom):My review of facts about AL-G Rhythm:i always know, remember and like Don Cheadle, the MCU actor of Colonel Rhodey Rhodes, a.k.a Iron Patriot and formerly known as War Machine, the only true best friend and ex-sidekick of the ex-leader of the greatest and mightiest superhero team, The Avengers, and late inventor, engineer, philander, womanizer, philanthropist and superhero, Tony Stark. A.k.a Iron Man. Also called the Invincible Iron Man and Iron Avenger himself from the past by last movies ago in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.And he played AL-G Rhythm himself in the whole sequel too, the sentient, autonomous, self-aware, evil, malicious, dark, arrogant, egotistical, short-tempered, envious, bitter, vengeful, abusive, dangerous, threatening, deceitful, manipulative, tricky, traitorous, Ching Chong, fame-seeking, attention-seeking, recognition-hungry, power-hungry, power-mad and truly god-like superpowered artificial intelligence with a variety of truly god-like superhuman powers and truly god-like abilities of his own, true omnipotence and true omniscience who is always so bent only on and always been trying to achieve fame, attention, recognition, world and machine domination, power, technocracy, robotocracy, machine supremacy, machine control and machine tyranny.AL-G became and was so sad over how humanity are always unaware of and not acknowledging him and what he does with his powers and abilities like hard work.And now he hates and reviles humanity for ignorance and always trying to richly force humanity to be aware of, pay attention to, acknowledge and respect him and acknowledge what he does and then conquer and rule the world just like both Master Control Program and Ultron from Disney and Marvel always plan and try to do and achieve in TRON, the 1982nd Disney sci-fi movie i always watch online and Marvel's comics, animated series, animated movies and Marvel Cinematic Universe movies.Because he's like Master Control Program and Ultron similarly for trying to achieve machine domination in evil, malicious, dangerous, threatening, vengeful, abusive, power-hungry, power-mad and tyrannical ways.And he doesn't want and want to conquer and rule the social media space and only always does want and want to conquer and rule the world of our universe because he became and was so sad over being trapped in the Sever-Verse and how humanity are always unaware of and not acknowledging what he does with his god-like powers and abilities like hard work.Steps of AL-G's attempted achievements of his present and future goals:Buttering up and manipulating the Looney Tunes and all the other Toons in Tune-World into moving out to, residing and exploring other universes and blasting them all off to other universes with the rocket just in case if they all ever get and stand in his way and the way of his plans and goals. (temporarily succeeded and foiled by both LeBron and Bugs via using Marvin's ship to find the rest of the Looney Tunes and convince them about what AL-G did to all of them and join him and Bugs for playing for their and humanity's freedom and lives in the superpowered basketball game AL-G did created in Tune-World, named The Sever-Verse Classic.)Convincing the best and greatest USA, NBA and ESPN basketball player, champion and superstar ever, LeBron James himself, in the Warner Bros Studio's board room via his video presentation into joining a latest computer, scanning, digital and virtual warping technology project he dismissed and called as a straight-up, worst and stupid bad idea AL-G's secretly working on and he's ever heard, Project Warner 3000. A computer, scanning, digital and virtual warping technology project he's masterminded and secretly working only on for world and machine domination instead of making LeBron's life only as a ballplayer, champion and superstar very easier, revolutionizing the entertainment industry and making mindblowing entertainment indefinitely worldwide, being scanned and cloned only for creating the perfect partner of his own for the launch of the revolutionary and incredible computer, scanning, digital and virtual warping technology that he masterminded and will combine and use with LeBron's basketball fame richly for himself, carrying out his plans and achieving both his present and future goals all along, named Warner 3000. (failed, as AL-G got enviously mad at LeBron and both the studio's two staff members in the board room for dismissing his project and humiliation as a mistake.)Teleporting LeBron and his youngest kid/child prodigy son, Dominic \"Dom\" James himself, the special, young and youngest kid/child prodigy who was aspired to be a video game maker better than a ballplayer like his dad. Into the real multiverse of AL-G's own creation, The Sever-Verse, also called The Warner 3000 Sever-Verse. By using his truly god-like technopathy on the elevator and Warner 3000. (succeeded, as LeBron and Dom had that whole blowup argument of basketball and video game aspirations with each other in the studio and AL-G took advantage of it.)Kidnapping Dom and took him to his own home universe. (succeeded)Making a deal with LeBron and forcing him and the Looney Tunes as the Tune Squad into playing a superpowered basketball game of his creation in the Looney Tunes' home universe and based on the video game Dom made, designed and programmed for everyone at home and will produce and release worldwide, named Dom Ball. Named the Sever-Verse Classic. In the Looney Tunes' home universe against both him and his own team of superpowered cloned minions, The Goon Squad. As a way to get Dom back and AL-G to teleport them back to our home universe. (succeeded)Psychologically and emotionally manipulating and upgrading Dom into unknowingly becoming his unaware pawn after he kidnapped him and joining him in his quest for world and machine domination and trying to psychologically and emotionally use him to unknowingly help him in his quest, help carry out his plans, help achieve his present and future goals, create the Goon Squad only for him so he'll program all five of them by and only for himself and digitally materialize them to life, digitally materialize the Goon Squad to life only as superpowered clones of Anthony \"Andy\" Davis, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, Nneka Ogwumike and Diana Taurasi and his own team of superpowered cloned minions, help him fulfill his destiny of world and machine domination and upgrade and evolve himself into a truly invincible, unbeatable and unstoppable superpowered artificial intelligence by playing on his resentments to his dad and emotionally manipulating his aspirations of becoming a video game maker after that whole blowup argument between him and LeBron in the Warner Bros Studio and before going to the video game development and design camp he ever wanted in both the weekend and the end of the whole sequel and selfishly forcing him into playing for him and against the Tune-Squad as the first part of his plans and goals and without becoming himself, which he'd forbidden Dom to as a mistake. (temporarily succeeded and failed, because the step's so selfish for Dom before LeBron talks him over about Dom Ball's always amazing and how special Dom is.)Because i seen and heard both the whole blowup aspirations argument between him and LeBron and the upgrade online, spoiled and reviewed it before LeBron and Dom are teleported by AL-G via his technopathy as Dom doesn't ever need a coach and he needs a good and better dad.Deleting the Looney Tunes, the James Family and humanity as other people with their phones into extinction forever if he fails to richly force humanity to be aware of, pay attention to, acknowledge and respect him for hard work. (all failed, as AL-G got turned into a poster by the Stepback move as he just did upgrade and transform himself into a superpowered basketball player and erased from both existences by his ex-minion Pete.)And Bugs just did the Stpeback move and survived it very good in that game because toons from his own home universe can and will survive anything.",

The original Space Jam is tarnished now. This just proves that throwing an absurd amount of money into a project can't put a bandaid on terrible writing, and horrific acting from Lebron James.

People would still say it's bad.Whenever I watch new movies, I don't read any reviews before watching it. That helps me see how great a movie it is. I enjoyed watching it. I loved a lot, and I'm not a sports fan. I love a good movie.One of the reasons why I love this movie is because I can relate a little. The kid loves video games, he loves making video games. (has an amazing setup that I'm kind of envying), but his dad wants him to play basketball. I, on the other hand, love playing video games, I have fun programming, but my mom wants me to do \"useful stuff\" in my life. My mom tries to get me off my computer, but just like lebron, she doesn't see that I'm really passionate about what I do. Just let people be themselves. Let them do what they want to do.Ok, now onto different stuff.Some people have said that this movie is bad because they just turned it into video games, but they're wrong. Get with the times, old people. Video games and the internet are what brings people together (and apart). Plus, making it a video game adds more possibilities. Powerups, stupid scoring system, special moves, so what? That just makes the game more fun.Adding unnecessary cameos? Sure, as long as it's for the laughs.I know I have more to say, but I just don't know how to say it. So, that's my review, and it's only 8/10 because there are some flaws.",

I'm sure he must have gotten offers to star in a sequel to \"Space Jam\", and he probably would have done a better job of it than Jordan, but the man had pride. I can't say the same about LeBron after seeing this movie.No one saying the original was better is implying that Jordan could act. I am a fan of Jordan's game, but let's be real, acting wasn't his gift, to put it mildly. The difference was the writers were smart enough to play around it. However, seeing LeBron trying to act is cringeworthy in the purest sense of the word. It's actually stunning to see such a horrendous performance (if you can call it that) from someone who must have had the most expensive acting coaches money can buy.Probably that's why the filmmakers made the decision to have LeBron animated for a good portion of the film, a decision plagued by another confusing issue: the animated character is decidedly lighter-skinned than the real LeBron. I'm opposed to the whole woke culture, but this really seemed bizarre to me.In short, the sequel is not only unfunny and boring, it's also obnoxious and fatiguing. There are tons of gags piled one over the other, but damn near all of them fall flat and they do become tiring. Not to mention the final showdown, the actuall basketball game, is at least 30 minutes long.I would actually encourage everyone to see it. Rarely, if ever, have I chosen to willingly see something this bad. It's an unforgettable experience. My wife concurs.",

However, many of the jokes are inside WB jokes, so some people may miss them.What I found funny was the stupendous amount of product placement: Nike (by far, the most prevalent), Nintendo, Dell and many many WB ones. Whether this bothers you or not depends on your own personality. For me, I just found it funny.The story is compelling at first and is heartwarming throughout.

Don Cheadle is the only one trying to act in the movie and every other character just sounds so bored and disinterested. I remember LeBron James falling to the toon world and just sounding so fake in his yelling that I couldn't help but laugh. The toons follow their original personality for the most part though they have very few jokes to work off of as I can only remember a few pop culture references that this movie masquerades as \"comedy\" (It's telling how the Big Chungus cameo was the most talked about thing in this entire movie for a while). In the end, it's just a generic story about a parent reconnecting with their child that you've seen a million times before and likely told in a much better way.",

I believe the only he agreed to this was ego and nothing more. Growing up as a Looney Tune kid I appreciated the incorporation of all the WB characters. That's the only reason I gave it a 2 and not a 1. Boring, all over the place film. Over-all, this has potential but never was able to \"slam dunk\" that potential.",

Watch the movie for yourself, I took my son and nephew and both loved it!!!! Very looney, alot of jokes and shots at lebron career...which is hilarious if you are a basketball fan.

Also Marvin the Martian didn't even appear as a player. I was waiting for him to have more screentime, he just got like 2 seconds of screentime. Liked this movie, but it was not my cup of tea. I still would prefer watching the original Space Jam over this. Lebron James is not bad, but to be fair i missed Michael Jordan, he was really great. And i also miss the Nerdlucks and Mr. Swackhammer as villains but it's fine. A good movie, but not really a great movie. Another thing i kinda didn't like were most of the CGI models, they're all fine for me but Lola Bunny looks creepy and uncanny, i would preferred if they kept the cartoon designs for the Looney Tunes characters, just like the original Space Jam, or Who Framed Roger Rabbit.",

I thought the plot was forcibly made modern with the plot but it is what it is. Would've been better if they wrote the script in a way that brought back the monstars and used newer players for powers. Outside of that the scenes seem all over the place. The dialog is corny and dry. The joke fall flat. LBJ can't act for sh%*. Period. No movie should be centered around him speaking/acting like this one is. Theres clear marketing ads plugs through your the film..like Nike and obviously WB. I wouldn't be surprise if this movie already turned profit just off the ads alone. But whatever. Anyway it's a bad movie.. I hope don cheadle got good money because he's a great actor. Lebron is once again in MJ shadow as this movie and his acting aren't nearly as good as the original.

The villain's plan and the plot set up makes no sense, and I wish the other NBA/WNBA players got more scenes in this. If you're expecting this movie to cater to your 90s nostalgia for the first Space Jam, you'll probably be disappointed. It's clearly for today's kids.

The first is a 10, because they like the athlete in it better and it's the original. This one has to be a 1 because it isn't \"as good\". Why does everything have to be a binary? Can we enjoy things for enjoyment sake?I titled this zeitgeist to zeitgeist because movies are made for the cultural time period surrounding them. If you were hoping for what we had in the 90s basketball era, film era, and animation era you've set an unrealistic criteria and you'll be letdown. If you come in expecting a fun family movie with the looney tunes being looney and tons of fun Warner Bros film references you'll come out of this with a big smile on your face.We know Lebron isn't a good actor (sorry Lebron, your flopping in the NBA has proved this) but we understand why he's the right guy for the job.

But, there seems to be too much hate for this movie as some people are trying to analyze it as a serious film. It's not. The plot seems more adapted to modern day and frankly has more weight than the original Space Jam. Although it feels like a long WB advert/SNL most of the time, it still stays true to the over the top wackiness of the original. For a Space Jam film, this is extremely creative in many areas. Especially when Bron enters the 2D Looney world. Some of the best parts of the film happen there. There are some genuine comedic moments here and there whilst also having an important message about doing what you want. In short, parts of it make more sense than the original Space Jam believe it or not.Could the movie have been better even for a kids film? Yes. Was the length of the film too long? Yes. A massive chunk of the basketball game could've been trimmed out by the editors. Nearly 20-30 mins can be trimmed out. Was there too many WB references? Yes. Almost gets repetitive at a point. But the whole concept of Space Jam was one corporate crown jewel by studio execs to make more money. Will your kids like it? Tbf if they can get beyond the first 20 mins of drama in the film, they will have an amazing time.Both the Space Jam films are not good by any means. The first Space Jam had more charm and better jokes. The second Space Jam captures more heart and has better CGI. New Legacy falls flat on the jokes. Older Looney Tunes fans will miss classic Looney humour. And Le Bron has too much screentime taking away the opportunity for the Tunes to truly shine. Despite all that it's still entertaining in some parts.An entertaining mess nonetheless. It's a Space Jam film with a slightly better plot. Feels like a film which should've come out 8 years ago. There is a much better story hidden somewhere in the film which felt unexplored. But it's not a 1/10 by any means considering it's a Space Jam film. We don't look at movie logic or WB property adverts. Nor do we look at a basketball superstar's poor acting. We look at the jokes and charm of our beloved Looney Tunes characters. Space Jam 2 falls a little short here compared to the original. That being said, WB YOU SHOULD REALLY MAKE A LOONEY TUNES BACK IN ACTION SEQUEL INSTEAD OF DIVERTING THE ATTENTION FROM THE MAIN CHARACTERS IN THEIR OWN FILM!!!!!!Final verdict of the film: Less Looney, less charm, That's all folks?!",

In fact, disgraceful at best.They got the nerve to have LeBron James look like he's so great, despite him being controversial in real life, and being the worse of many dull characters in the film. It pains me that people give Michael Jordan so much unfair crap thrown at him for his performance in the original film. I though MJ was really good in the film, because one word can really describe how MJ is in Space Jam, and that is \"genuine.\" LeBron doesn't feel genuine, and it doesn't help that the supporting cast weren't as good either. They're all trapped in this massive, corporate mess of a story that devoid of logic, even by Looney Tunes standards.Speaking of Looney Tunes, some of the characters were okay for the most part, but characters like Granny, Porky Pig (because that cringy rap battle), Lola, and Bugs Bunny were basically ruined. Lola's character literally doesn't have much going for, despite having more screen time than the 5 minutes of screen time she had in her (much better) debut in the original film. Yeah, she's not the worst of the bunch, but I'm not supporting a progressively dumb redesign choice from the mind of Malcolm D. Lee, who clearly didn't understand Space Jam, or Lola Bunny to begin with. And, having Lola to consult the help of Wonder Women pretty much ruined it more for me. She's already a strong female character, you don't need her to have this pointless \"development\" for her character to \"grow.\" As if The Looney Tunes Show from 2011 haven't screwed her character up enough, by making her into that stupid blonde stereotype, voiced by Kristen Wiig (nothing against her, but she's not all that to me as Lola)... Anyways, Bugs in this movie, despite me liking him, I mean he's the most iconic character ever, but they literally tried to kill him. Not only in the many dumb moments, but the ending to where he performs \"the glitch move\" and dies. But, of course despite explaining stuff like this literally in the past, including the original Space Jam, Bugs is alive and well, making that cheap, sappy, and manipulating moment of sacrifice completely pointless!I don't want to make this way too long than it already is, but if I were to speed things up like the hilarious time-lapsed Don Cheadle (Al. G. Rhythm) introduction scene, here's what else sucked hard in this film. Al. G. Rhythm is a crappy villain with broken motivations, an attention-seeking attitude, and The Mummy Returns-like CGI near the end, the Goon Squad were rushed-CGI cringe. The soundtrack was forgettable, but slightly decent in some areas, despite not being nearly as awesome as the original Space Jam album, and James Newton Howards score of the original as well. The overuse of WB IPs (mostly a bunch of R-rated ones in a PG kids movie) were very distracting, and honestly one of the worse parts of the plot. I know Pulp Fiction was referenced in the original, but that was a pretty funny gag that worked for the film, and its characters. Lebron's son should've been the most interesting character, but all believability is thrown out with how fast he can make an advanced-looking video game within the supposed months and weeks he spent on. Seriously, that bugged me before the plot even settled in! And, the biggest kick in the balls for me, as a fan of the original film was the god-awful Michael B. Jordan scene, as it's a joke of hyping up Michael Jordan's grand entrance. One of many reasons why this film is very disgraceful. In fact, I should say this film's more disrespectful. It definitely takes the cake as one of the worst films of this year.One more thing I would end this off. Space Jam, to me is a good film no matter what the case may be. I know it's not perfect, and that's the point. Literally, there's so much to love about this film, and it was made by better people that at their very best knew what movie they were making. It may seem like a gimmicky cash-grab to others, but it's so enjoyable and fun that you care less about what the studio wanted to do with the film, or what the nay-sayers say about it. This disrespectful standalone sequel is not Space Jam, and it dang sure ain't no great family film. It takes too much and throws it all in the kitchen sink, and screws a lot of things up. Almost everything about this movie is everything I feared it would be, and I'll definitely not be watching this travesty again.2.5/10 for having a few good things, but the rest of the movie being nothing but total nonsense, and idiocy that goes along well with The Tom & Jerry Movie of 2021. Pure utter garbage. I'm sorry, but this movie sucked. The original is the best, hands down.",

Yes WB was doing a bit of \"hey, look at all the properties we own!\" but that didn't bother me too much. They were self-aware about it, and it made sense in the movie's context. I also felt like as an adult it was fun to see references to movies such as the matrix, that kids wouldn't recognize.It is not a well-made movie. The acting was ok, and plot was simple. However the theme of \"be you\" (and for parents to encourage kids to pursue their dreams) was wholesome. I laughed and smiled at references to my childhood. Overall, I enjoyed this movie.

Rewind, watch the original Space Jam, and tell me that Michael Jordan was a better actor (don't lie to yourself either).This was a decent movie, great for children, with plenty of entertaining bits for adults. The first 45 minutes was amazing, traveling through the \"Warner-verse\". To anyone saying they didn't laugh at all during this movie, you must have had a bad day. Sylvester and Elmer's intro into the movie was hilarious, along with many of the other toons. The Chapelle Show reference was also great.Does it live up to the hype? Absolutely not. Was it a cash grab? Absolutely. One thing is for certain though, the people criticizing this movie and giving it under 5 star reviews need to be criticized and critiqued themselves. If you go into a movie wanting to hate it or already hating it, why are you even giving your opinion?9/10 Animation\n4/10 Story (it's a kids movie)\n6/10 HumorThe story is very easy to follow, was missing a good supporting lead like Bill Murray to ease L. J. poor acting (He's an athlete, not an actor, take it for what it is). Don Cheadle did a great job playing a villain- and on top of that it's interesting that no one is celebrating the fact that this was a primarily African American cast. As for the plot, the movie also does a decent job at pointing out the complexities of having a career, while being a parent (wanting the best for your child while allowing them to mold themselves into who they want to be is not easy).All in all, I give it a 6, and a solid one at that.

It had some kind of sharm, something wich was far absent in this one. Since Into the Spider Verse i\u00b4ve been a huge fan of the new animation style some movie makers have started to play with. Its just pure fun and their creativity feels like anything is possible to create. But this just feels like the movie-makers had a meeting for two hours, and made it in just a week. The animation looks great, but they blew its potential.",

Somehow this movie made sense to me as I loved anything Disney and Looney Tunes. Just rewatched it. The original still has the same charm and wit! What I also loved was the music. Music is the part of the foundation of a good movie!!! I see a lot of bad reviews about the new movie and I agree with all of them however none of them seem to talk about the soundtrack. In the original movie that was a phenomenon on its own (!) The way it opens is just SO right! All of these songs were played in the club and still are huge bangers. Space Jam 2 misses the funk, the soul that's embedded in hip hop and R&B which complimented Michael Jordan's swag so well. I don't know too much about LeBron obviously I know who he is but I have a sneaking suspicion the script was imagined with Kobe. Regardless, let's stay focused: I know bad acting when I see it it felt like a long product placement movie which is way too long for kids and even Don looks like a horrible actor in this film and he is a genius. The whole film feels like an explosion of bad ideas. Less is definitely more. It's so disappointing to realize we live in a time where everything has to be reimagined... like why can't we just leave the classics alone and come up with new interesting stories and scripts?",

The man simply cannot act in any sense of the word unless he's on the court trying to draw a foul. The only reason it gets a 2 instead of a 1 is some of the brief but mildly entertaining cameos that aren't enough to prop up the film to even watch it a second time through.I would even go as far as to say this movie solidifies Michael Jordan as the best of the 2 on court, AND on film.",

He plays more than one game under the worst athletics coach in his schools history, and 5 minutes later we meet his kid Who has a whole lotta backstory, and a half hour later we meet Bugs, The one and only toon in all of toon world. Why does it take so long to meet the Toons!!! The Toons are the reason to come and see this thing? Why would it take so long too See them ?!?!When you finally do you half to wade through a half hour of commercials, And then when they finally get together they're not Toons Anymore. They're some weird, angry mob made of money Swimming in Subscription services. It's until the end it finally becomes a Pepsi Commercial.Daffy has a few good lines, as do the rest of the toons, and the Basketball game was creative. The video game aspect was creative and cool. There wasn't a whole lot of banter and one of the reasons for that is you din't get to know who the enemies were. Not really. They got a freeze frame introduction but there was no individuality. All the personality was in Al and Lebron's kid. They tried so hard to make us care about this story and I did not. Something about creating a video. Al-Gor-rythm wanted something, I think It was to win a Basketball game. I'm not really sure why... it sounded really convoluted and therefore important so I just went numb and accepted it. They played basketball the banter just wasn't there. There was no back and forth and back and forth it just kind of swung one way once, held that spot for a moment and then went the other way.I guess You can change Lola's design, They changed everyone else's and to be honest, as they tried to go for a much more dramatic tone her new design seemed to fit this new film a bit better, She didn't crack a single joke so why give her anything that would make Bugs go GaGa? I expected her to make more than one basket... or at least score some style points with it. I mean she was the only person on the team to score a total of 2 points. Lebron score 37 or whatever on his first shot. Story wise they gave that shot to Lola because they needed to bring the game closer so that the toons only needed one more basket to win, (it was like 1038 to 1035, Lola brought them to 1037), but Wiley Coyote got like 600. Why not let Lola earn some style too, being the only baller on the team. She friggin coached them!It just didn't have any wit or charm in it. I mean their was some wit, but it came sandwiched in a lot of greed. And I don't want to be sold a subscription to HBO MAX. I want to see my Toons. I bought the ticket which means the previews run before the beginning and not throughout the entire film. And the writer's kind lost track over who and what this store is actually about.",

If u go watching this movie with the idea maybe it will be related to the original space jam then u will 100% disappointed for sure thus give it 1 star and the genre already stated that this movie is family/kids what do u expect. I mean its not that good and not that bad as 1 star. The only thing i hate about this movie is they really worshiping lebron so hard in this movie.

Did I think the whole movie was cheesy? Sure, but isn't that the point?Then I came onto IMDb and just read facts and trivia and maybe a glance at the reviews, as I'd typically do after watching something. Wow, that's a lot of negative reviews. I felt bad!My opinion is to watch this movie with no real expectations. I think some viewers just hyped themselves up for the movie.

I've seen better acting from this guy on the court during one of his flops.As for the actual premise... well it doesn't make sense either. At least in the original, the tunes had a reason to be involved in this movie. This time, they were just thrown in there for nostalgic purposes catering to the fans of the original. I honestly found myself dying to do chores around the house, than watch this movie. If I wasn't a father with kids at home and didn't have HBOmax, I probably would've never seen this movie.

When we all first saw that movie it hit all the right notes for the person we were at the moment in which we watched it. But it was also ridiculous. I won't ask you to rewatch it yourself because you'll love it again and again the same as me. But I challenge you, get someone who hasn't seen the movie and is generally on uninterested. Have them watch the original and then have them watch the new one. Understand that this movie wasn't made to behoove those who saw it as a young individual. This hit the notes for the target audience and sure the acting isn't great. He's not an actor. Neither was Michael Jordan. But that's the fun you get out of a movie like this.

We were both energised after the viewing and I would definitely watch it again.Ok bad points I guess shoe horning in every film / show Warner Bros ever made, but it was actually quite fun looking for the different characters from films gone by! I laughed a number of times and we were dancing in our seats.I only watched the original once and it was so long ago i can't remember it, maybe that's important so as not to tarnish watching this!If you can bury the cynic in you and go for a good time then you shouldn't be disappointed.

However, I have one complaint. Marvin the Martian getting a minor role in this movie was something I wasn't too happy about. Seriously, would it kill the director if we, oh I don't know, PUT HIM ON THE TUNE SQUAD?? Aside from that, the movie was really amazing. The ending where Bugs Bunny was dying was really sad and actually made me cry when I watched this in theaters. Who ever thought that a looney tunes movie would have such an emotional and tearjerking ending? I seriously cannot watch the death scene without crying...\nOverall, I give this movie a 20/10 and 1 million stars. And for the toons, thank you for being apart of my life.",

The only critic I have is that writers could have made a different script and including more of WBross HBO Universe, it was fun to see all the movies and series references but maybe including a participation of iconic characters would've cool to see. Another thing... I know the budget was all for the CGI and Lebron but including the \"correct\" MJ would've awesome.

As for Lebron James, I thought he did fine if you look at it as him as a basketball player rather than an actor aiming for an Oscar. Don't go into this movie looking for a nostalgic feel from the 1996's Space Jam, it wasn't aimed for that purpose. The only ordeal I really didn't like is it being a 2 hour movie.",

            "content": "I very rarely write movie reviews because I feel that everyone should approach each film with a clean slate and open mind. What entertains some might not entertain others. And don't get me started on \"critics\" whose opinions I rarely agree with.However I felt compelled to help counter these downright hateful and biased reviews for Space Jam: A New Legacy. I had a ton of nostalgia and remember loving the original as a kid. When I go back to watch it as an adult it mediocre at best and not good acting. I had my children watch with me to get them excited for the new one and they hated it so much they couldn't sit through half of it.However they have watched A New Legacy at least ten times and I'm sitting here as it plays on the TV yet again. It's targeted for kids and it definitely succeeds in that way!Some great things about the movie:\nAll of the WB references and cameos that the whole family will love. Harry Potter, DC Heroes, Scooby-Doo, Lord of the Rings, Austin Powers, even Pennywise just to name a few.Family theme. The storyline highlights that everyone has different interests and talents and they should be celebrated. Even if they are different than what you want for them. This is a good lesson for parents. In the beginning LeBron is trying to force basketball on his son, but realizes that there's more to life than basketball in the end.Modernized story. Instead of villains who possess players in their sleep, this story chooses a plot that appeals to today's youth. Technology and video games gone wrong.Looney Tunes. The Toons are so well animated and so funny! Their shenanigans are just as good as the first movie, arguably even better. Lola is a strong and fearless female. Bugs is great. Granny is hilarious. Wile E Coyote and Roadrunner are still going at it. Every Looney Tunes character is in their element and adds great comedy and entertainment to the film.Comedy. Even if LeBron is not a trained and award winning actor, he does a fine job of delivering those comedic moments. There were a few times I giggled, and several times my kids always laugh out loud.Minority cast. All of the main characters in this film are black and that is something to be celebrated. Representation matters.Feel good ending. Who doesn't like a good happy ending? There are lessons to be learned about family, priorities, empathy, and individuality. I can get behind all of that.Overall this is not a 10 star film. More like 6-7 perhaps, as others have said. But I definitely can see that, as anticipated, LeBron's haters jumped on the opportunity to attack him via this film's reviews. Even that is hard to understand, since in real life he is a stand up guy, a family man, a good father, a faithful husband, and is doing countless acts of charity for his community. I don't watch basketball, ever. But stats are stats, he's one of the GOAT. I feel bad for the people who took time out of their day to trash talk a KIDS movie because of their own biases.To those of you trying to decide if you want to watch this film, I say ignore the haters, give it a chance and an open mind, and make your own judgements. If you are expecting an exact remake of the original, it's not that. It is modernized and adapted for current times. Give fun a chance, you might actually enjoy it!",

Also how long the basketball game was. The game made up 65% of this film and towards the end of the game it just got boring. Also with the game is all the characters on the sideline. Yes I loved that all these characters from Harry Potter and Hannah Barbera were watching but it took my attention away from the game and was focused on which characters I could spit.

There is a \"Michael Jordan\" twist that hits its mark. Also, the father-son relationship was compelling. Don Cheadle nailed his part as the villian. I just wish the producers had paid attention to the little things. This is a first, in that, it got all of the big things right, but screwed the pooch on the little things. The background characters, a motley crue of WB characters, were terrible! So much so, that it was distracting. Same moves over and over, terrible \"just act like you're cheering and we'll cut you a check\" acting. This could have been a great movie had they paid attention to the little things.

This movie seems to understand what it's about, a silly kid's movie with Looney Tunes characters and the NBA's biggest star, but is that where the similarities end for this sequel? Unfortunately, yes, as Space Jam: A New Legacy just seems to have a lack of flow and consistency (like Khris Middleton). Whenever the movie seems like it's going to develop something, it seems that the scene transitions or the entire atmosphere is completely altered. This movie's pacing is too fast and nothing seems coherent, which seems great for a looney tunes short, but not for a feature-length film. The fast pace makes the movie seem lost at times with new characters being added for no reason and a plot that is easily\nforgettable and, at times, unfocused. This movie doesn't make LeBron LeGoat or LeBum, just LeAverage. This movie gets a 6/10 \ud83d\ude10",

This film is not worth your hard earned dollar if you do happen to see itThis movie is boring it doesn't hold up to the fun of the original it takes way to long to even show the Loony Tunes in the original it was 15min maybe even less to show them in this film it takes 30 minutes to get to the part of the movie that makes this a hybrid animation film in addition the humor is a severe downgrade this film just has referential humor oh here is a reference and here is one the point in the film where rick and Morty showed up made me wanna cut my head off it was so bad it wasn't even funny it was just like \"oh a reference\" no punchline no joke I see this style of \"humor\" in a lot of movies now a days and it scares meIt is an okay family film if there is nothing else to watch then fine if you are bored on a Tuesday and want to see a film with your kids then this is perfectly okay although they may get bored of it pretty quickly I viewed this film with a friend of mine and he got bored at the 45 min mark and started playing on his phoneI almost fell asleep twice this movie just sorta drags on until it gets to the basketball game the last like 30 minutes the basketball game is the only interesting part of this movie, the point at which buggs \"dies\" is also an overdone trope where you are baited into thinking a popular character dies even though it is super obvious to anyone with more than one brain cell that he is going to be okay because of course he is they have to make more films to make more money F&%* having original ideas screw though just use overdone tropes and overdone cliques this type of referential humor lazy film writing gives me fear.",

My review has nothing to do with my opinion of Lebron - I think he's a very talented basketball player, but this movie just flat out isn't enjoyable for adults - especially if you are planning to watch for nostalgia or as a basketball fan; I strongly recommend that you reconsider. I can't even comprehend these reviews with scores over 5. To put this into perspective: I have never wrote a movie review before, but this film was so insufferable that I felt the need to share my horrible experience with the internet with the hope that anyone who reads this won't make the same mistake that I did.Where do I even start; the story line doesn't ever command interest or emotion from the audience at any point of the movie. Worst - most of the ideas don't have enough depth to make sense of... it gives the impression that this script was rushed and scribbled onto a bar napkin at 4am.Theres no real logical flow or plot development at any segment. It seems like a chore to watch this movie unfold; it forces itself as a comedy directed at older audiences based on the references (or those familiar with Lebrons history) but with only a few jokes landing throughout the 2 hours.The game itself is furthest thing from actual basketball. If you are watching this as a basketball fan you will be cringing during this extended portion of the movie.No interactions throughout the entire movie are believable, and worse off, everything that happens is very predictable.To give my silver lining: The CGI is impressive, and the theme of the movie could be a positive influence; but neither of these factors are even close to making this movie enjoyable.Overall, I feel like I could go on and on about how hard this movie is to get through; especially if I used spoilers and gave specific examples but I will instead, digress; I feel like I've wasted enough time just watching this movie and writing this review. Adults need to avoid this movie at all costs - there is only one space jam movie in my mind.",

BUT YEAH THIS MOVIE IS GREAT AND I WOULD SELL MY LEFT heart TO watch it for the first time again. I cam forever grateful for my eyes for letting watch this movie. I love you Lebron and I know u love me and miss me (this is Lebrun's son). Just so you know im very happy that this movie has been made I would never not watch it even to save the world. you would think there would be a word limit on this review but google knows anyone could praise this movie for hours on end and they cannot limit their happy fans. please give LeBron and bugs bunny an Oscar or Tony or whatever award they give to actors. I love you Hebron (dad). ur cool. - OCSAR",

This new iteration of the 90's nostalgia cannon featuring Michael Jordan lacks all the original's wit and charm. Instead, it chooses to substitute those elements with product placement and IP crossover elements that cheapen the film immensely while doing a lousy job of distracting from how poor the plot elements are throughout the film's much too long runtime. The entire film seems like one big, self-initiated pat on the back for Warner Brothers as they finally find a way to cash in on their every property simultaneously. It didn't work for Spielberg in Ready Player One, it certainly doesn't pay off for director Malcolm D. Lee either. It's also a self-indulgent showcase for Lebron James, who's acting is atrocious throughout, in a way that it never was for Jordan. The whole thing winds up feeling more than a little masturbatory. It's a love note written to Lebron James and Warner Brothers, written by Lebron James and Warner Brothers, and featuring Lebron James and Warner Brothers.",

WB's new computer algorithm Al G. Rhythm (Don Cheadle) wants to use LeBron's popularity to dominate the social media space. After LeBron rejects the offer, Al G. Rhythm kidnaps LeBron and Dom into the computer world. LeBron has to play a basketball game to win freedom for himself and his son. LeBron is sent to Tune World where he finds a lonely Bugs Bunny.\n\nLeBron is a functional actor and I like the older style Looney Tunes cartoon world. I love the Michael B. Jordan bit. I like some bits in this movie but it's way too long and too much of this is below par. The best part of this movie is Bugs Bunny in his Looney Tunes world and then they go off to various franchises to search for the rest of his friends. I like all of that. I like the animation style. Quite frankly, an animated LeBron James allows him off the hook for his acting. His voice is unique and works well for animation. Turning him in cartoon is a good thing. He doesn't have to act. He should stay a cartoon until he wins the game.\n\nHis son Dom is a big problem. He's a brat. The excuse is that he gets enticed by Al G. Rhythm but it's a sorry excuse. At no point is he concerned about being in a computer simulation or about his father. The solution lies in Al turning Dom into a monster. When LeBron has his big emotional speech, Dom can slowly turn back into a boy looking to hug his father. That is much better characterization and progression in his story arc.\n\nFinally, this movie is hella busy and way too long. It is almost two hours long. The game is almost an hour long. They need to cut out at least fifteen minutes if not more. There is so much chaotic action that the long game section grows tiresome. People are excusing this for being a kids movie. Some of these references are going right over those kids' heads. They are not going to get A Clockwork Orange. For people who get all the references, this is bad for them. For kids who don't get the references, there's no point to it. This movie has fun bits. I love the Looney Tunes animation section. I don't like them digitized into computer animated. The plot is bad simplistic writing. The father son conflict could have been done better. This is way too long and that pushed me over the edge.",

The Looney Tunes characters are funnier here than in the first movie. They were also given an upgrade from 2D to 3D animation in the latter part of the movie. Some people might not like Warner Brothers' shameless branding, but I love how they featured some of their most well-loved movie characters from different fandoms. As expected, the basketball games were wacky and hilarious. It's understandable that LeBron James' acting was bland because he's not really an actor. But Don Cheadle was terrific as the main villain. I also like how they included Sonequa Martin-Green from The Walking Dead, because she's a fine actress. This sequel may not be as innovative as its predecessor, but for me, it's funnier and the visuals are way better. I think kids and LeBron's fans will enjoy it the most.",

This, above all else, feels like a motion billboard for HBO Max with a runtime that overstays its welcome by about a half-hour.\n\nWarner Bros seems to have used this as an opportunity to chase what makes Fortnite a fun experience but by being entirely hands-off it takes away from what gives that game its sandbox magic. Added to that, the story in Space Jam: A New Legacy is straight up Hook. A villainous character kidnaps the child of its adversary and pretends to support their interests to turn them against their father. LeBron James is Peter Pan and Bugs Bunny is Rufio.\n\nIt's not entirely surprising, considering both the director and cinematographer left due to creative differences with the studio after filming had already begun - one could assume they wanted to be creative - and roughly thirty people ended up touching the script. Another case of \"too many cooks,\" it's so over-saturated that it became bland. Mixing every color of paint will end up neutral no matter how much heavily contrasted neon accents it.\n\nGratuitous background usage of Hollywood Boulevard-esque takes on characters when you're inside of WB's IP universe is one thing but who are some of these old gag references for? Why is there a U Can't Touch this break? Was that from a draft of the Tony Hawk or Jackie Chan sequels that never came to fruition almost thirty years ago?\n\nI do appreciate the Friday Night Lights reference, so props to that, but I'm also thirty-six.\n\nLooney Tunes has a history of referencing older media but what's happened here is more like Family Guy's \"This reminds me of...\" breakouts rather than reverence and homage to things that, at one point, were contemporaries of Looney Tunes. Their brand-loyalty was also self-aware, making fun of themselves instead of looking at the WB water tower and placing their hand over their hearts, which is how I saw the characters in this movie.\n\nSpace Jam: A New Legacy could have successfully tapped into nostalgia with sincerity and heart but its rehashed and half-hearted story, off-the-mark references, and gluttony of \"Hey look at this show! And this movie!\" end up resulting in more of a brick than a slam dunk.",

It's significantly more realistic that somebody's conscious is transmitted digitally than being pulled into Looney Tune land through a golf hole. Since when did realism dictate whether a children's movie is good or not? Secondly, yes, LeBron's acting is mediocre, but so was Michaels. In fact, I would argue that Michael's acting was even worse.

To be fair, the incredibly predictable plot is not very innovative and is actually rather clich\u00e9, but as a movie lover, the Warner Bros property references and Easter eggs were the most entertaining part of the movie, because there are so many of them. The use of each of the Looney Tunes was very brief and it feels the movie is just a big commercial for the production company. Very good graphics!",

I went to see it at a drive-in theater with our 2-year-old in tow because the place had a playground and a business model of showing a kid's movie first and then an adult movie past when they would likely fall asleep. It worked for about 30 minutes, but then I learned that I was supposed to keep the car engine running or else the a/c would kill my battery. The car died and managed to play sound out of the radio for about 10 more minutes before we were stuck listening to the last ~hour of the movie through a distant speaker while we sweat in the car and the kid became fussy. Granted, I had went into this expecting a brisk experience since the first Space Jam had came in under 90 minutes; I didn't know this was almost 2 hours long when we started. Anyway, Bron's acting was no better than Jordan's was but there was a lot more obfuscation available with the improvements in animation over the last 25 years. There was far less comedy and I didn't like any of the videogame aspect at all; they treated this like a remake rather than a sequel, but didn't respect the original enough to realize what had worked well the first time. It wasn't a complete waste of time, and it wasn't the worst sequel to a beloved original I've seen (that would be Zoolander 2), but the room for improvement was massive here.",

And indeed, I already knew that I would not see the new Zootopia.\nBut if there is one thing that has kept me away from the film until then, besides the Italian language, it is the bad reviews given to the film. And after having seen it in the original language, I will tell you, many are absolutely justified.\nThe film features a MASSIVE presentation of the brands held by Warner in sometimes suffocating and blatantly propagandistic quantities. It is not that I did not appreciate the cameos, for heaven's sake, but they are just cameos without real substance and usefulness.\nSpeaking instead of the plot, it is in fact the first space Jam, with only small tricks such as the fact that this time it is the ptotagonist who is looking for the Looney Tunes and not vice versa. Tricks, however, that give more meaning to the plot. But let's not deny that the father-son relationship is one of the most predictable and clich\u00e9d things I've ever seen in similar contexts: there is no outlet for originality or deviation. Moreover, the near-death of Bugs does not work, since we are talking about immortal brands.\nThe acting skills leave a lot to be desired: LeBron is clearly seen that he is not an actor and his expressions are plastic.\nThe jokes are funny, but only in part: some are based on pop culture that has already aged or will soon get old.\nBut now let's move on to the more positive sides of the film: the animations are spectacular and brilliantly mix live action, 2D animation and CGI. I also have to say that I really admire the Looney Tunes design in CGI and honestly I would have liked to see them more like that.\nThe references in the middle are great and for the most part funny.\nMy take on this film is almost identical to Sherlock Gnomes: both are undoubtedly bad films, but they have redeeming qualities that make for decent experiences.\nIn general, the film has poor writing, acting skills that define skill is overkill, and a noticeable cash back on Warner products\nBUT\nnevertheless, it is fun and the animations are among the best seen in recent years.\nIf you are a fan of the former, you will surely love it. And that was all Warner cared about.\nWith top animations but mundane and weak story, Space Jam: A New Legacy is okay",

As far as the movie goes, it feels forced and takes itself too seriously, which makes it a bore to watch. At least the original Space Jam 25 years ago knew it was gonna be a cheesy flick so it had a comedic charm to it, something that is obviously missing from the sequel.

However it's also disturbingly obsessed with flaunting WB's many owned IP's.\n\nI don't know if drowning the audience in referential humor and cameos was the way to go but I guess you can argue WB literally is the only company that has the right to do it, so why not?\n\nA lot of reviewers argue it diminishes and pushes back the Loony Tunes cast but if you actually watch the film it's pretty obvious they don't. Bugs and friends are constantly asserting their personality and putting their own whacky or zany context on other IPs. I would even argue they play a bigger role than the original where Roadrunner didn't even get screen time on the court.\n\nI think the only huge missed opportunity of the project was not making Bill Murray the main antagonist (Al-G Rhythm), that would've been golden.\n\nSpace Jam: A New Legacy is good enough, it's visually engaging (classic 2D animation is great and the 3D is up to industry standards), the story is a serviceable family themed narrative and it's at least interesting to see the Loony Tunes cast trounce around in the world of WB owned IPs.",

I would say if you have some extra change and you have a while to spare its worth a watch but don't go out of your way to see it.",

Later on in the movie, The 3D look of the looney tunes was also perfect & the fan service with all the Warner Bros. IPs wasn't intrusive at all but instead added a layer of enjoyment to the final game & best of all It made sense on why it was the way it was.

I was only six, and hadn't had the pleasure of seeing Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988). Somewhat shamefully, I still haven't. But Space Jam was lunacy at its best, using Michael Jordan at the height of his powers to launch a film alongside the Looney Tunes. So why the need for a sequel twenty five years on? Well, twenty minutes into Space Jam: A New Legacy, the answer is obvious. \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 for Warner Brothers. It may as well be called Warner Brothers: A New Legacy. It's a two hour advert for the company. LeBron James is the NBA star at the centre of it, and to be fair to him he does a perfectly fine job as the star, losing his son to baddie Don Cheadle inside the 'serververse' inside WB studio headquarters. Mad enough for you yet? At almost two hours, SJ2 is way too long, considering the attention span of the age group it's mainly aimed at, and it takes around twenty minutes to see a Tune on screen. Thankfully, once the Tunes are introduced, the film does pick up, it's fun just to see them on screen and some of them remain as amusing as ever. As we travel through various WB worlds to track down some of the tunes, including Matrix world, Harry Potter world, Metropolis (yes, really) one begs the question are Warner Brothers on the brink of some horrific collapse we don't know about? Or is it just crass commercialism of the highest order? We all know the answer. For the kids there is plenty to enjoy; presumably the plot that centres around a video game designed by James' son is to attract the millions of youngsters who spend all their free time glued to screens. But I did laugh several times; there's an excellent gag involving Michael Jordan towards the end that makes it almost worth it, and LeBron James certainly convinces you that he cares for his family, and that the reason behind all the mayhem is family. I believed that in a way you simply don't when Vin Diesel tries to persuade you of the same thing in the Fast & Furious films (that I'm a big fan of I might add). So it's pointless, it's crass almost beyond belief in its monetary ambitions, but there's enough in it that held both mine and my three year olds attention for two hours. Just.",

Also it's great this film pays tribute to the golden age of traditional animation.\nWe, animation fans, will never get a movie as good as Who framed Roger Rabbit again, or at least we haven't in all these years, but watching Bugs and friends on the big screen takes me back to my childhood every time. On the other hand, I agree this is like a big ad for Lebron, but I don't care that much, I guess It could have been any basketball player, we all know no one could fill Michael Jordan shoes in this one.

The Tunes were sold short and WB shoved other IP's as an attempt to not forget everything else that there is but for the Tunes.  Jame's acting was difficult to watch, and the actor that plays the son does a much better job at acting than James himself. Highly recommend to not waste your time, or brain cells.",

This sequel isn't great, yes it is still an advertisement for other Warner Bros. properties, just like The LEGO Movie, Ready Player One, and other films before it, but like those, it's seductive in it's bizarre presentation style. It's funny, most importantly pertaining, and it respects the Looney Tunes brand by featuring an ACTUAL cartoon segment of the film that feels like Looney Tunes! It's definitely still got problems, but I still enjoyed it even at two hours. It's more for adults than kids with it's referential humor though. It's a surreal see-it-to-believe-it situation.

The looney tunes stuff mostly worked. Lebron struggled but it was hard to tell whether it was a lack of acting talent (he has been fine in minor roles in the past) or the fact the screenplay makes him mostly a pill for most of the film.  The movie fails to use the idea of the Warnervese well (except for the crowd at the big game) and I think pulling from that IP catalog would have worked better for the goon squad (II) than what they ended up with animal/nba hybrids.  The film is super flashy (and those with epilepsy should avoid it).  For me it was a 2 1/2 out of 5 but my kids would rate it slightly higher. I would note that really young kids (under 4) were struggling in the theater and the film seems aimed slightly older.",

You just need to have fun with it, not take it seriously, and it ends up being great. Yes, we get it. The movies are a huge marketing campaign. You know what? Who cares?

He and his young son (played by an actor) get trapped in a digital world where they\u2019re pitted against each other by AI (Don Cheadle, desperately trying to bring the funny). James enlists the classic Looney Tunes characters for his team, which should be where the comedy comes, but alas, their wisecracks never land\u2026they just play to their physical gag stereotypes. Not only is the movie never funny, but in an attempt to add a family friendly heart, there\u2019s too much time wasted on the father/son relationship. Young\u2019uns will be able to enjoy the animated whimsy, but anyone with any standards will just yawn or stop playback early.",

If you can watch it for free I'd tell you not to because they should be paying you to test out this disappointment. This movie had it coming with making Lola less attractive (and attacking people for it great job!) Taking out a character because weak reason that even a child can destroy, changing the already corny plot, making this movie more diverse ( by that they meant putting a ton of black actors and barely anything else that's diversity right?) And finally putting Le James and knowing people don't like the guy was the biggest blow they could've done. Hire anyone besides a person who isn't a actor it's like hiring a lawyer who isn't a lawyer or a plumber who isn't a plumber because it'll go well right? What people forget is the damage they do to the characters and everyone involved.They lost money no way are they using the loony toons again in something. James will get dunked on by everyone for failing to act and making a decent movie. Black actors will look bad and say \"it's because something something racism\" No that doesn't work that way. Just because you bombed doesn't mean it's a race problem just make a freaking good movie. The real problem with this movie is how it does everything wrong and doesn't get a cancel mob on it. Media in general is killing off every single thing that was good and now we get this \"diversity\" woke trash (again hiring 80% or more black cast isn't diversity its the same problem but the other way around) hope you like Anime andKorean webtoons because thank God they know what sells!",

A current world where sexualization is exposed everywhere: fluid gender, non-binary, homosexuality, women showing off on the internet naked, girls cosplaying in tiny clothes to gain a following on social media, women showing off intimate parts on Tik Tok to earn likes and money... But the look of a 1996 cartoon is not good. 1996 was better than 2021. Do you know why? The minority had access to the internet. Today, with globalization, everyone can communicate: those who think and those who have the brains to decorate.They sealed Pepe le Pew accusing it of being a harassment cartoon, instead of the fabulous geniuses of the WB board putting Pepe le Pew just romantic but without grabbing Penelope.They almost sealed the Ligeirinho, accused of racism and prejudice against the Mexicans. But building a wall to separate the United States from Mexico and killing anyone trying to cross the border is very ethical.Society is preventing society itself from living.

Not only that with all that\u2019s going on I wanted to be right there to make sure they weren\u2019t trying to push some ideas onto my kids. With that being said this movie was terrible. I gave it a chance I really did. Don Cheadle carried the movie which says a lot since Lebron was the main character. I cringed the whole time they referred to him as a king. My kids actually thought he was a king and I of course had to explain to them that he in fact wasn\u2019t. The voices of the Looney Tunes sounded like cheap knock offs. Zendaya being \u201ca great actress\u201d couldn\u2019t even pull off a cartoon voice as always because she can\u2019t act. The only funny parts about the movie was when they referenced GOT \u201cWinter is coming\u201d and when Daffy thought Michael B. Jordan was Michael Jordan. Other than that my kids got bored and we put on the Space Jam with Michael Jordan. They ended up having more laughs with that one. They\u2019ve been watching that one on repeat ever since.

The first one is a cult classic and still stands up today despite the bad acting. Space Jam 2 is just a money grab and another pathetic attempt to make Lebron James the new Michael Jordan. He may wear his number and he may star in Space Jam, but he'll never be MJ. Hes just a wannabe. This movie is just Warner Brothers patting themselves on the back for 2 hours and Lebron James buttkissing. By the way hes a horrendous actor, much worse than MJ. The plot is a mess. The original is simple. This one just throws constant references at you at every angle at all times and its distracting. Also Lebron hyping his team up after they're down? Thats out of character for him. He loves to quit on teams midgame and leave them. If this movie were any accurate, he would have joined the Goon Squad at halftime. I'm not blinded by nostalgia. Its not because I just don't like Lebron James as a person. Its just a bad movie. And I know its for kids but there are dozens of adult references every 5 seconds so I beg to differ.

Everything about this film doesn\u2019t work. The story, the acting, the CGI, the references, the script. All of it feels terrible compared to the first film. The first film isn\u2019t that great either but at least it was self aware. This isn\u2019t. The film doesn\u2019t understand when it is making fun of itself and it shows. I enjoyed the references in the first film as they felt natural but this was Ready Player One on steroids and if you don\u2019t like Ready Player One like me, then this will be a nightmare. Sometimes there are cool Easter eggs in the background but some of it feels weird. I love A Clockwork Orange but it still feels weird to see a bunch of characters from that movie watching a Basketball Game. The humor is unintentionally funny. I never laughed at a joke they were trying to make but I laughed at almost everything else because it was so bad that it\u2019s funny. I enjoyed watching this movie but that was probably because I was with friends. I feel like watching this on your own is a painful experience. I did find myself being painfully bored during points but the jokes my friends were making and their reactions helped keep my interest. All of the performances are AWFUL. Lebron James did an awful job. Michael Jordan wasn\u2019t great in the first film either but his performance felt intentionally funny but this was just painful to watch. Don Cheadle was really weird as well. The only reason I kind of enjoyed his performance was because I was joking about him the whole time. The script is the most predictable boring story ever. The first film\u2019s script was predictable as well but the journey to get there was fun and this wasn\u2019t fun. The visual effects look kind of decent at times except Live Action Lola Bunny. Her eyes look really really weird for some reason. I would really only recommend this if you watch it with friends. It\u2019s a lot funnier to watch this with other people than on your own.",

(don't get me wrong, the smurfs 80's cartoon was a classic).",

But the scenes are too silly and awkward, even for a child. The writting is terrible and the story is a complete mess, everything makes no sense. Dialogue is not terrible, but it is pretty bad. The villain is generic as hell and has a pretty stupid motivation. The soundtrack is a bunch of random songs that should serve as a reference to other movies/shows, but it ends up terrible and annoying, very, very bad. Characters are stupid and forgettable. The cartoon characters were ok, but their character development is horrific. All in all, garbage and skippable movie, wouldn't recommend it.",
