A Netflix animated flick I had no interest in (my 11 year-old felt differently) and ended up fully in its embrace. The father-daughter storyline is handled with care even azs the Mitchell clan is hunted by robots and giant Furbys (you read that right). The animation's vivid and the characters well-drawn (no pun intended) while the sentiment is heartfelt. Lord and Miller are becoming household names they've been killing it.",

It also helps that 92% of the jokes land right on target. Did I mention that it also has a disarmingly astute emotional core?Honestly, at this rate Sony Pictures Animation may be beating Disney and Pixar at their own game.",

            "review_title": "Innovative Experiment of a Family Road Film",
            "content": "Sony Pictures Animation has been growing further and further in their filmography by experimenting with fresh computer technology and innovative stories, and none could be better proof than their most recent feature, The Mitchells vs. The Machines. Co-written and directed by former Gravity Falls writer Mike Rianda, the film was initially set to come out in September of 2020, but due to COVID restrictions, it was eventually delayed until the end of April and released on Netflix. Now that the world is finally ready to see the Mitchells unleashed, just how much was the wait worth it in the end?The film follows the Mitchells, a dysfunctional family with an aspiring filmmaker daughter named Katie and a down to earth father named Rick that fail to see eye to eye from when they were younger. While attempting to rekindle their relationship on Katie's trip to college, the whole family winds up having to save Earth from a robot uprising while on a road trip. Now based on that bizarre premise, it would seem like we have a case of two different movies clashing together. However, the otherwise routine storyline of a family overcoming their differences is ultimately saved and even elevated by this other arc, because the movie's biggest theme lies in how overly dependent people have become to technology nowadays. While it is wonderful just how much the world has advanced in adapting to technological innovation, including animated features, one must be careful to not take it for granted. Sometimes, all it takes is just one person to deem an AI obsolete for the whole world to fall under chaos; that is just how much the reliance on technology has grown in humanity, both for better and worse.As for the Mitchells story arc, like I mentioned before, it is admittedly a fairly standard plot about a parent and offspring needing to overcome their differences to connect again. However, to the film's credit, the characters themselves range from charmingly hysterical to surprisingly relatable. Katie represents the adorkably creative artist in many of today's generation, Rick is a good hearted albeit overly indulgent maniac of a dad trying to figure out today's youth, Linda is an overly perfectionist mother that demands the family be functional even at her most calm, and Katie's little brother Aaron might be the most hilarious dinosaur obsessed squirt since Calvin from Calvin & Hobbes (and their bug eyed potato dog Monchi is the cherry on top). This whole family of eccentric weirdos drive the film forward, especially compared to their allies and enemies, be it evil robots or family rivals. Not to mention, the whole cast clearly had a blast in their roles, especially Abbi Jacobson and Danny McBride being the most authentic as a quirky albeit frustrated teen and an overly impulsive father.Out of all the animated features to be released this year right now, this film might have the most unique visuals and art direction yet. In addition to Lindsey Olivares' stylized character designs translating seamlessly in the SPA renderfarm, the animators did the most in exercising their acting chops to make the characters move like real people yet still feel appropriately exaggerated. The backgrounds are also a neat reflection of how the United States would look if it went from a neat colorful environment to a post apocalyptic sci-fi nightmare, with the right amount of special effects, color gradients and shadows to go along with the world-building. There are even nice additional 2D animated chunks that are either used in lieu of exposition or cute little add ons to the suspense in a given scene. The only genuine criticism to give the visuals is that sometimes those gimmicky effects and filters can be a little too frequent and even jarring, especially when some of the movie's humor is overly reliant on modern internet culture. Let's just say some of the filters could come off as jump scares.I can't think of a better energetic romp of a film for the whole family to enjoy as much as this one. Not only is The Mitchells vs. The Machines an eye-catching twist on the family road dramedy genre, but it might be the most fun animated film released in a while. If Netflix and Sony Pictures Animation keep up this track record of enjoyable thrill rides disguised as innovative experiments, then there's no telling what the future holds for moviegoers. If you haven't seen the film yet, go on your Netflix account and give it a go. There's never been a better time to connect with your love of movies than now.",

Katie is unimpressed but soon she, her parents, her dinosaur obsessed brother and their pug are on their way. Shortly after they set off news comes thorough of a major technological advance; cell phones will soon be defunct; replaced by robots. As soon as the designer announced this the robots rebel and start capturing all humans. Only the Mitchells remain free; it will be up to them to save humanity!I really enjoyed this animated film; there were plenty of laughs from start to finish as well as child friendly thrilling moments and mild scares. It might not be as philosophically deep as Pixar films but it still had something to say about family without being mawkish. It didn't over use pop culture references, and those that there were, such as the nods to 'Kill Bill' were subtle enough that those who don't get them won't be thinking they've missed something. The animation is impressive with good character designs and the voice cast do a fine job throughout. Overall I'd certainly recommend this; it is a lot of fun and suitable for all ages.",

He refunds her plane ticket and takes the family on a cross country road trip to her school. Mother (Maya Rudolph) tries to keep the peace while dino-obsessed little brother is dragged along. It's not the end of the world or is it? Unbeknownst to them, the launch of a new phone AI is leading to the machine apocalypse.This is written and directed by Michael Rianda and Jeff Rowe. Their most prominent previous work is writing for Gravity Falls. This has a lot of that show's sensibilities and I love it. I love the animation styles. I love the family. It's a quirky family. It's a quirky family with a wild outrageous world-ending apocalypse and it's fun. My only complaint is that this may be a bit too long. Of course, I would look to add another scene with the Poseys. It would be great to have the Poseys return to cower in the gas station and telling the Mitchells to hide. It would be the inflection point and a call to arms moment. As it stands, the father acquiesces to his daughter. If the Poseys come back, little Aaron could gain confidence to be heroic. Mother Linda can strive to show her family's worth and father would still be the last to join. It would work better with a better catalyst. All in all, this is a fun movie and everybody should watch it. Afterwards, you can binge Gravity Falls.",

It's definitely hyperactive, playing with 'internet culture' in a way that almost confirms stereotypes about modern day reduced attention spans. It doesn't dampen the experience, though; it just means that you have to adjust to its quick, almost unforgiving pace. Having said that, the story itself is actually rather slow to get going (it feels often unrelenting in the moment because there is often so much stuff packed into so little space). It's also a tad long on the whole and is, generally speaking, really predictable. These issues don't mean that the movie isn't entertaining, though. It's rather fun when it gets going and its characters feel relatively rounded. There are a handful of exciting set-pieces and the jokes land more often than they flop (though there are some cringe-worthy moments, for sure). The thing is also beautiful from a technical point of view. It's animation is lively, believable and full of joy. Actually watching the picture is enjoyable in and of itself. Overall, it's a solid animated effort with just about the right balance of humour and heart. 7/10.",

            "content": "The Mitchells vs. The Machines is a must-see animated, action packed, comedic film! It's complete with robots, evil smartphones and one crazy unexpected family adventure to save planet Earth. The fight scenes and special effects are literally out of this world.The storyline follows protagonist Katie Mitchell (Abbi Jacobson), a creative outsider who is looking forward to meeting \"her people\" at her new film school. Her dad, who just wants to keep his family together, decides to go on a cross-country road trip to take her there instead of Katie flying, so they can bond one last time. On the way, the family ends up in the middle of a robot uprising and now it's up to the Mitchells to work together to save the world.The main characters in this film are Katie, her dad Rick (Danny McBride), little brother Aaron (Michael Rianda), mom Linda (Maya Rudolph) and family dog Monchi (Doug the Pug). This film is all about connecting. Its director, Michael Rianda, uses every part of the creative process to make sure the audience relates to the characters. The storyline and the Mitchell's road trip are based on a real road trip some of the staff took while not using cell phones and just connecting. I love how the film combines both an illustrative, hand-painted approach and realism animation style to help develop the characters. Rianda helped develop Katie's character by making her love for filmmaking a focal point throughout the movie. There are hilarious freeze-frame moments where Katie is writing on a screen, it's almost as if she is the narrator. One of my favorite scenes is when Linda turns into a \"super\" mom and takes on the robots to try to protect her kids. I also like that Rick and Katie's family song \"Live Your Life\" by T. I. and featuring Rihanna is used to represent their relationship and wrap up the theme of the movie.The message of this film is that everyone in a family has their own personality and you should just let people be themselves and focus more on understanding and connecting to them. In this film, Katie is considered a \"weirdo\" because she isn't like everyone else. The film shows how you should embrace your \"weird\" qualities, because that's what makes you unique.I rate The Mitchells vs. The Machines 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. It releases April 30, 2021 on Netflix. Reviewed by Tiana S., KIDS FIRST!",

Every aspect of the film is done perfectly - the characters are memorable, the moments are relatable, the action is rousing, the animation is stunning, the designs are sleek, the mix of visual styles is entertaining, the generational conflict is amusing and the humour is on point. In a complete 180 from The Emoji Movie, the treatment of social media, memes and technology is very up-to-date and clearly done by millennials who actually understand the topic. In the same way that Into the Spiderverse felt like a traditional comic come to life, this film felt like a Buzzfeed webcomic come to life. There are messages about family acceptance and human connection that go beyond the banal \"phone bad\" lectures of previous boomer flicks. This film is a masterpiece of the 2020s and of the millennial generation.",

The Mitchells vs. The Machines is hilarious & heartfelt when it strikes the right notes but it's also overstuffed & overwritten to the point of annoyance.Co-written & directed by Mike Rianda in what's his feature directorial debut, the film employs a quirky animation style with a premise that promises plenty of fun & thrills but it's way too hyperactive for its own good. Rianda stuffs the story with everything he could think of. The comedic scenes are a hit or miss but feel like an onslaught at all times. And its dramatic moments don't pack a strong enough emotional punch to stick the landing.Unbridled energy is beneficiary but only if it is directed in the right direction. Here, it is all over the place with no one to keep a check on the overdose level. The themes & representation are done well but the narrative did need some brakes to not come off as trying too hard to be funny. There are times when it gets the combination right and those moments deliver the desired impact. And there's a lot more of that buried beneath all the suffocating glitter & filters.Overall, The Mitchells vs. The Machines is an unnecessary exercise in excess, and just a touch of restraint would've gone a long way in making it enjoyable & amusing for viewers of all ages & spectrums. Nevertheless, for a family-friendly fare, it offers a sufficiently entertaining extravaganza with good, hearty dose of laughs & fun. But there was also room for improvement here. And all it had to do was to slow down & trim out all that it could've done without. Not as impressive as it is made out to be.",

But it's much more artistically ambitious and driven by a theatrical, hyperkinetic vision than that. Thrilling, heartfelt, hilarious. Lord and Miller productions match and in some cases surpass Pixar. It's got deliriously and constantly inspired animation, an aesthetic that works for and earns respect within 6 minutes of when it starts (what else to say about a teenage filmmaker who makes the kind of magic that is akin to Wonder Shozen, only better because it's 2021 and we've all learned so much how to do it better), and Olivia Colman voices an evil app.Without question this will inspire a ton of young people to go to film school, and hey maybe one of you will call your lovable doofus of a dad and see how he's doing. Mitchells vs the Machines is about how to or how not to function in a family, especially how a daughter with a mental/emotional block with a dad (and it's very much a Why Are Dads saga), and why having a simple conversation can, you know, do a lot. Oh, and Furbys will kill you all.And more than comparing to Goofy Movie, you know what this is? It's The Simpsons back when it was *great* - cutting edge satire, self conscious and knowing so deeply about culture right now, but with a heart as big as a...

            "content": "IN BRIEF: Family animated film that follows its formulaic root in storytelling, despite some clever animation touches.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) Whenever one discusses the merits of animation nowadays, the same issue with the genre raises its ugly head: It is a rarity when both the narrative and the visuals mesh seamlessly. Usually, the state-of-the-art animation excels the storytelling. Which brings us to The Mitchells vs the Machines, the latest effort from Sony Pictures Animation, a studio that is primarily known for its Oscar-winning film, Spiderman: Into the Spider-verse. In this case, the same results follow that winning formula.This family-oriented fare is a flashy road movie with a dysfunctional family trying to save the world from a robot apocalypse. Written and directed by Michael Rianda and Jeff Rowe, the movie is a clever spin on the generation gap with a sci-fi edginess. Despite all the mayhem happening around the family, the Mitchells become the unlikely hope for mankind as they rage against the machines and try to avoid their own destruction. This mission forces the always quarreling father and daughter to begin to bond as they fight off the bots, with an overabundance of underwhelming pop tunes blaring on its soundtrack.The screenplay tries to focus on the relationships within the family dynamics, but the characters lack depth. The story settles into a series of endless chases and dilemmas. (If you want to see superb animated sci-fi about a family of misfits, may I suggest Pixar's The Incredibles series franchise?) However, the visuals in The Mitchells vs the Machines are consistently eye-catching and well rendered, although some of the animation becomes too manic for my taste. The backdrops are filled with superb detailing and the movie makes good use of its CGI.There are funny sight gags to enjoy and having all of its characters become stylized exaggerations with big eyes and distorted facial expressions, more in line with the Looney Toons cartoons of yore has its charms. (Especially fun are the comic antics of two defective robots named Deborahbot 5000 and Eric.) But the moviemakers never trusts their own instincts and never allow the moviegoers any downtime to enjoy some quieter moments. The quick edits and garish color palette, along with the jarring camera movement, seem desperate to impress wheneverpossible. Every single moment must be choreographed to be loud, bold, and brash.Fine voiceover work is done by Mr. Rianda and other better known celebrities such as Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, Abbi Jacobson as the Millers and Olivia Colman, plus Fred Armisen, and Beck Bennett as the malfunctioning droids.The movie's main flaws are its breakneck pacing that becomes overdone and a script that needs to calm itself down. As the movie races to its uplifting climax, it switches gears and goes into sensory overload. The jumbled screenplay relies more on tongue-in-cheek cyber in-jokes and sophomoric humor that mostly falls flat as it tries to salvage the plot. The filmmakers make a misstep in breaking through the fourth wall too often in their storytelling techniques with abrupt stops in the action which jarringly interrupt the many well-done chase sequences.I suppose that The Mitchells vs the Machines would qualify for standard animation fare these days, perhaps a cut above the usual offerings. This Is ambitious and innovative animation to the max, well worth viewing. One cannot deny the talent of Mr. Rianda and company. Still, despite all the lavish creative artistry, this hyperactive film follows a predictable formula for success. It may visually satisfy some moviegoers with many innovative touches, but the movie does little for the intellect or emotions. Perhaps the robots do end up winning in the animation war after all.

Nominally, the tech CEO here shares his forename with Mark Zuckerberg, struts on stage in front of employees and sycophants to present new products, Siri-esque (or \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968) HAL) PAL in hand, like he's the late Steve Jobs, a logo reminiscent of the Amazon arrow or smile thing surrounding him, as like just about every tech company stealing and abusing customers' personal data, including for robotics or some form of what's commonly termed \"artificial intelligence.\" If that's all there was here, though, it'd be a hypocritical slap in the face to audiences--embodying the very qualities that it supposedly critiques in its Terminator-for-kids apocalypse (being especially derivative of \"Terminator Genisys\" (2015)). It still is largely, which along with its diabetic-levels of sugary family sap is why I have mixed feelings for it, but there's also the reflexive device of the filmmaker being a character.This, at least, allows for a less duplicitous self-serving message as distributed by Netflix. Note that the resolution to the robot apocalypse doesn't reside with the Luddite position of the father, but with a compromise of technology serving human interests--specifically, to aid in our making and viewing motion pictures. Look at how the filmmaker daughter drives the car through PAL's Silicon Valley headquarters--like a data signal being sent along cables. Indeed, like a virus as the dog's face attacks each computerized robot. Moreover, it's a film-within-the-film as presented by YouTube product placement, through the actual internet dynamics and streamed to screens big and small, that's humanity's best hope.It's obvious this isn't a serious (or seriously funny) examination of the role of technology, let alone the corporate capitalism of big tech, by the fact that the animation is entirely imbued with the aesthetics of social media and web videos. It's the usual 3D computer animation, but as if put through those camera filters, made into memes, and with the action constantly paused so as to be digested through the content creator's wisecracks for those with miniscule attention spans. Personally, I suppose I'm relatively a bit of a Luddite myself and so find revolting this sort of imagery, forms of communication and glorification of glowing faces drowning in their phone addictions, but I admire the thorough symmetry of it here, as opposed to an inconsistent bit such as, say, the texting sequence in \"Crazy Rich Asians\" (2018). Plus, the eye of the computer frame (or the equivalent of the no-longer-existent camera) really, manically moves. More than two-and-a-half decades after \"Toy Story\" (1995), it's hard to make 3D computer animation still appear a stunning spectacle, so kudos to \"The Mitchells vs the Machines\" for succeeding as much as it does in that respect. It especially helps that the picture is made to appear as if being constructed within by the filmmaker character--the movie proper being but an elaborate variation on \"Good Cop Dog Cop.\"",

The father-daughter story is sweet and they got the right voice actors to bring it to life. The script is funny and the story does what you expect but in an engaging way.But the animation is gloriously expressive. This the best representation of meme/online culture I have seen in film. Most of the animation is representative-photoreal-3d CGI done with care and skill. But over that is a layer of seemingly hand drawn (by a gifted but young artist) crayon and crude photoshop. The final film feels like it was made by Katie Mitchell.",

            "content": "After Sony Pictures Animation released the visually stunning, Oscar-winning Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), I awaited their next project with great interest. Eventually, they put out a trailer for a movie titled Connected, which seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. Then the pandemic hit. Netflix grabbed the rights, renamed the film, and released The Mitchells vs. The Machines (2021). Ultimately, it was a fun movie, even if it followed many tropes of the family road trip.Visually, I'm finding the new style of 3-D animated movies that look closer to the traditional 2-D animated films to be an intriguing middle ground. There are benefits from both styles, and this movie takes advantage of them. Ultimately, though, I think this kind of movie knows its demographic is millennials and does its best to pander to some of our absurd humor (like a fantastic scene with Furbies) as we find ourselves coming into our life as parents faster than we want to admit. Sure, there's still some humor that appeals to the younger generations (it is an animated film, after all), but it kind of hit that sweet spot for the millennial in me.I definitely found the frenetic action of this film on par with The LEGO Movie (2014)-which itself had a unique visual style and humor that parallels this movie. All this being said, The Mitchells vs. The Machines felt unfocused. It tries to cram two full plots into a single movie, which made it feel a little bloated (at almost 2-hours long) and some of the emotional moments tacked on for the sake of completeness. For my money, I'd much rather watch Lady Bird (2017) for the \"daughter leaving home to pursue her dreams in college\" plot-especially since jobs in the film industry are quite lucrative.Another visually unique animated film from Sony Pictures Animation, I give The Mitchells vs. The Machines 4.0 stars out of 5.",

The Mitchell Vs The Machines is Sony's attempt to use the Pixar Formula and gratefully the outcome does match that expected level. Sony hasn't delivered so many classic films except for the Spider Verse in 2018 which is moreover a Marvel's film for the viewers so the standalone credit was still missing and with this Film they have found that Standalone Classic. A quirky, dysfunctional family's road trip is upended when they find themselves in the middle of the robot apocalypse and suddenly become humanity's unlikeliest last hope. This concept is very unique and is on the same lines of Pixar Classics. I've always wondered how Pixar manages to blend fictional characters and imaginative theories with the human emotions and that's exactly what this film does here. A little child friendly topic turns highly functional with the use of technovanza and then ends on a high note with heart-touching sentiments. Those monologues on family values brings tears and some of non-sense scenes suddenly starts making so much sense and shockingly it's doesn't even feel bad as far as we're enjoying it. The animation work is fine and the production design is innovative as they use different themes to provide some offbeat offerings. There are some problems with the screenplay because it looks little longer than expected and could have trimmed that slow beginning. Nevertheless, it recovers the shortcomings with lots of entertaining elements in the second half. Overall, The Mitchell Vs The Machines is unique, entertaining, emotional and heart touching family film that should be watched by the entire family together. A Classic Tear-jerker!RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",

What started off with likable characters I somehow could relate to, the film became overdone, unbelievable and silly once the 'invasion' started. It became nothing more than an over the top kids cartoon. The film is also an advertising vessel for YouTube and Instagram.I so enjoyed the film's first act. When the Mitchells were the only people left uncaptured by the machines and they became the unlikely heroes, I completely lost interest. It just wasn't believable. Yes, I understand, this is a animated film (cartoon!!) and not to be taken seriously and for entertainment purpose only, but this is so for kids, and not a mature audience. Sure, there are some funny and enjoyable moments, but the silliness by far outweighs the fun.The antagonist, PAL - the phone - is just absurd. I mean, it was hardly a force to be reckoned with and reminiscent of daytime cartoon villains. The machines self-destructing because they couldn't tell the difference between a dog, a pig and a loaf of bread was also just silly. The film played like a spoof of post-apocalyptic films like 'War of the Worlds', 'Dawn of the Dead', '2001: A Space Odyssey', and 'Gremlins' and 'Ghostbusters', and... and... and... In short, I became bored.'The Mitchells vs The Machines' did had a few family related touching moments, and sends out a message about family bonding and family values. Fair enough, I appreciated that aspect. It was also trying to be philosophical, and begging the audience not to sit staring at their phones all day.Unfortunately, as big a hit as the film was, as vibrant as energetic as it is, this is not for my palate. If you're into animated films, I suppose I would recommend it for at least one viewing. (Munchie was by far my favorite character, and was responsible for most of the film's truly funny moments!).Would I watch it again? No.",

            "content": "The Good: The Mitchells vs. The Machines is easily one of the funniest animated comedies I've seen in a while. It's funny for kids, for adults and everyone in between, using a mix of slapstick, visual humour, sardonic wit, and observational comedy to great affect. This feels like a movie written by people who LOVE movies (which isn't particularly subtle, but it's fine), and i loved how it poked fun at so many tropes fro apocalypse films and waded into some minor social commentary about our relationship to tech. I can't tell you how many times I laughed out loud and a lot of it comes from minor jokes or little visual gags in the background. Good stuff.But what I really love here is how well developed the characters are. Rick Mitchell, the patriarch of the family, is a bit of a technophobe, but his reasons make sense. The protagonist, Katie, is a young woman who wants independence and to carve her own path. She's very relatable and understandable too. Despite this film's energetic and zany visuals, it's surprisingly touching and human, with relatable people, relationships, and conflicts.Speaking of which, this movie is very clever and goes in directions I didn't expect. The care put into the plot and the pacing are reminiscent of a blockbuster rather than a straight to Netflix animated film. Olivia Coleman does a fantastic job as the villain. In fact, most of the cast is really, really exceptional here.However, we all know the reason this movie has become the fan favourite it is has to do with its AMAZING visuals. I'm happy that Sony Pictures seems to have really leaned into the Into the Spiderverse style of seamlessly integrating 2D and 3D animation, but in a completely different context. One thing I haven't heard people talk too much about is how the environments are so detailed and vivid. This feels like a lived in world with a lot of attention and care put into the background.I'm not usually a fan of meme humour and internet jump cutting in film, but...The Mitchells vs. The Machines may have won me over. When done well, it really feels like a product of the current age; tailored to audiences who are used to the hyperactivity of internet content. There's also a lot this movie *gets* about the internet and smartphones that a lot of other films don't. I love when movies about the internet are made by people who actually understand it.Yes, it's a bit rough at the beginning, but it grew on me and I liked how consistent the approach was during the movie.If I would describe this film visually, it's 2000s YouTube + Scott Pilgrim + Spiderverse. If none of these things appeal to you, steer clear. If they do, you won't be able to look away.The Bad: The movie does get a bit too cute at times, with running jokes that overstay their welcome. I get it, call backs are funny, but too many ruins the stew, you know? The film is also a tad too long; we don't need to be reminded why Katie loves her family or what she's learned. We get it. Consequentially, this film has the \"Return of the King problem\", where it just doesn't end at the right moment. It drags on, a lot of the steam runs out and I found myself just wanting it to wrap up. Which is bad for a movie I pretty quickly fell in love with.Also, like many zany animated movies of today, the beginning is a bit weak. It takes a while to really settle into the tone this movie is going for, but i really don't know if they could have done anything to avoid that.I also found some of human characters' animations somewhat distracting. I don't know if this film has motion capture or not, it certainly looked like it, and while for the MOST PART the animation is fluid and wonderful to look at, there are awkward moments here and there.The Ugly: The Mitchells vs. The Machines is essential viewing for Millennials. I swear. This movie truly feels like a generation of animators coming into their own, truly confident about a unique style that will be remembered for years to come. This is a special movie and I sincerely hopes it wins Best Animated at the 2022 Oscars, if for no other reason but exposure.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. What would happen if human survival depended on the Griswolds (from the VACATION movies) battling the rogue robots programmed to take over the planet? Filmmakers Michael Rianda and Jeff Rowe answer to that scenario is hyper-active, frenetic, overly-busy visual chaos that attempts to blend apocalyptic science fiction, extreme action sequences, and dysfunctional family comedy-drama. It's a lot to tackle, and for the most part, it works.Katie Mitchell (voiced by Abbi Jacobson) is preparing to head to film school. Her nature-loving dad, Rick (Danny McBride) is concerned about how he and Katie have drifted apart over the years, and he's also worried that her educational choice could lead to disappointment. Katie's mom, Linda (Maya Rudolph) is mostly supportive and upbeat, and yet a bit saddened that the once close father-daughter duo no longer speak the same language. Youngest son Aaron (voiced by co-director Rianda) and family dog Monchi have their moments, and mostly this is a fairly typical dysfunctional family. In fact, dysfunctional family seems to be a misnomer since it describes most families, even the highly organized one that seemingly have their act together ... represented here by the Poseys (Chrissy Teigen and John Legend).Katie's generation's adoption and dependency on technology has widened the gap in connection with the previous generation ... specifically the bond between father and daughter that was so strong when she was young, and now barely hangs on by thread. Dad is the generation of the supreme screwdriver, while Katie is all about creating memes and videos. He fixes things, while she creates things. Dad decides a family road trip to drop Katie at college is the solution to fixing the frayed relationship. This happens on the same day that mega-Tech guru Mark Bowman (Eric Andre) is introducing his next-gen PAL robot, which is smart technology on steroids. However, it turns out, software has feelings too, and the original PAL (Olivia Colman) seeks revenge for being replaced. An army of robots is sent to capture the entire human race.A couple of quirky things leave the Mitchell family as our final hope against the robots, and as you might expect, saving the world can lead to reparations in the father-daughter relationship. Dad gains an appreciation for the creative skills of Katie, while she learns of his great personal sacrifice for family. It's an unusual blend of two distinct stories, but mostly we are left exhausted after a nearly two hour run time. The screen is often cluttered and overloaded with distractions (including old school Furbys with a twist), and although there is a cool throwback look to some of the animation, it's simply too much of a good thing. Younger kids may be mesmerized by the frantic action, but the story lines are not likely to be followed by most under 10 or so. This one has garnered a great deal of Oscar buzz, which makes sense as adults decide such things.Streaming on Netflix.",

Yes, the first 30 minutes is a bit slow and very cliche, there are so many, I mean so many plotholes(if you want to call them that) and you know where this is going. Please don't be that person. Don't go on and say, \"Well on second this doesn't make sense at all\" or say, \"I guessed this thing happening from the start, so predictable\". Just don't. This movie's plot is stupid but it is stupidly fun and has a heart. Almost all of the jokes land, both for the kids and the adults and I mean that's a very hard thing to accomplish. Yes there are some jokes which were already very popular but come on as I said, don't be that person. The plot starts very cliche, and it continues to be cliche but somehow it makes it feel original and real even though the characters are very goofy. The movie goes to the limits with the goofiness and that's why this is the most fun I had while watching a movie recently. The soundtrack is also very good, both the songs picked and the themes(which had an electronic vibe, I loved that) are so good. THE COLORS... I mean this movie is also visually stunning, I mean the cinematography. I didn't expect it to be well-thought like this. Both the nature and the electronic(neon lights stuff) look astonishing, my favorite part of the movie. I highly recommend watching this with a family member(the more the better) as this is that type of movie. The type of kids movie which not only makes the adults enjoy it as well but also makes them enjoy it together. For example in Pixar both kids and adults enjoy the film but for the different reasons but in this film they will enjoy the film together for the same reason: \"The Experience\". This \"experience\" is a double edged sword though because this movie isn't memorable but the memory of you enjoying it with your family will be.",

When I first watched the trailer for this movie I thought that this story was just going to be a cliched movie but overall there are some elements to this story that are cliche but this story no matter what will hit you hard. This is a story that everybody can easily relate to whether it be a wacky family like this or just a crazy friend group. This story is for everybody, especially those who find it hard to fit in. This fact goes for the characters as well I found myself multiple times saying I related to multiple characters as all of these characters are fleshed out to the point it's impossible not to see yourself in one or more of these characters. Now, onto the animation part of this movie and oh my god is this animation gorgeous. The colour tones of this animation with the little switches between the regular animation of the movie to a more rougher-looking animation is just what makes this movie unique and stand out amongst the others. I also love the difference in the tones from when the family is just driving around compared to that of the robot city. The last thing I'll touch on is the music for this movie and how great the soundtrack for this movie is. I for sure will be listening to it while I study for school and do schoolwork. In the end, The Mitchells vs the Machines may seem like a cliche story but it's one with gorgeous animation and lots of emotion in it.",

The mother is weird because she believes in everyone. And the dad is so weird because he likes outdoor stuff. The whole premise is that this family is special because it's not like other families, while everything that is supposed to make them weird or special is as normie as it gets.It attempts to do current day references, but instead of merely referencing, they have to spell it out for you. \"My dad reminds me of that screaming monkey clip. Let me also show you the clip in the actual movie, and even crop his head on my dad.\" Very funny humor. All the memes were outdated before they started making the movie.The animation is very good, and the comic infusions are fresh, but sometimes they are too intrusive and take you out of the action or the moment instead of enhancing it. However the sound design does not match the visuals. Especially the music is weak.The movie has two messages, first that we became so dependent on technology and robots that they took over the world and decided to get rid of the inferior humans. Second, that generations have something to learn from each other. The problem with the first message is that there is no solution. At one point the person responsable for the end of the world says it might not have been such a good idea to give away all the data to unregulated companies after all. And the dad agrees, but it allowed his daughter to upload youtube videos, so it wasn't all bad. There is no solution, nothing is changed at the end. The problem with the second message is that the out of touch father closer resembles todays grandparents, not parents of teenagers. And the bonding doesn't feel natural. The final product is something that falls short. It should have kept it's message to either technology or the family, not both.",

It attempts to be some kind of combo between Zombieland, The Lego Movie, and i,Robot but doesn't commit to what made those movies successful within their respective subgenres. So many other films have already done this but executed it much better. It was an example of the current state of many movies being made by bigger studios in the animation industry: the filmmakers knew how they wanted to begin the film and end the film and padded out the rest of the time with lazy, boisterous worldbuilding (think Soul, Inside Out, Frozen 2).",

The treatment of LGBT people is one of the best of recent times, they don't need to wallow in their orientation for the creation of the character, it's just something that is there and treated as something normal not something that comprises and forms your whole SELF.As for the more technical aspects the film doesn't excel at anything but it doesn't lose out to its competitors, it's a film that doesn't get long, it doesn't lose pace at any point and the songs/moments of music are perfectly implemented.Oscar stolen.",

This particular mechanical coup d'etat comes at the behest of a thinly veiled Siri knock-off, an artificial intelligence that's finally tired of our mundane requests and verbal abuse. As the literal last family standing, the dysfunctional Mitchells must work through their private issues whilst also steering the station wagon around misbehaving smart appliances and, somehow, rescuing the entire human race.Beyond the silly robo-invasion and hilariously unlikely action scenes, it's effectively sharp and sweet, eccentric and real; one of those rare films that speaks to parents and kids on their own level while still maintaining a shared common ground. It's also a wonderful visual showpiece, furthering many of the concepts that first came to light with 2018's Into the Spider-Verse. I really dig that trend (dare I call it a house style?) from Sony Pictures Animation, a fresh mixed-media experiment which meshes smooth, stylish 3D models with effective spurts of kinetic, hand-drawn line art. Those play into the plot, baking personality into the frequent asides that fill out the family's back story, while also lending a quaint, made-with-care aura that illuminates the whole screen; they're downright charming.Well done on the graphical front, then, with only slightly lower marks on the narrative side. The Mitchells are an entertaining, colorful bunch, with an admirable amount of time dedicated to developing the secondary cast. Pacing isn't all it could be, though, given the deflating early anti-climax and a third act that drags on for too long. Maybe a few too many wink-nods at internet culture, too, but that's only a minor quibble. Overall, it's good. Really good. Good enough make me to wonder if Pixar might have finally met a worthy adversary.",

            "content": "I remember seeing trailers for this when it was called Connected, and I dismissed it as another subpar movie from Sony Pictures Animation. Then the pandemic hit and Netflix picked up distribution rights, and the reviews started dropping, with astoundingly high praise. I had to check it out.Katie Mitchell (Abbi Jacobson) is a college-bound filmmaker whose father Rick (Danny McBride) is the last person to understand the world through her eyes. In a last-minute attempt to reconnect, Rick cancels her flight from Michigan to California, and proposes that the family take a road trip to drop Katie off. Along for the ride are doting mom Linda (Maya Rudolph), dinosaur obsessed younger brother Aaron (Mike Rianda) and family pug Monchi (Doug the Pug).Meanwhile, in Silicon Valley, tech giant Mark Bowman (Eric Andr\u00e9) has released a monumental update in his PAL virtual assistance program (a cross between Apple and Google), but has disposed of his own device (Olivia Colman), which goes rogue and unleashes a robot uprising.Right from the opening logos, one knows they're in for a treat. While it does hit some familiar beats, The Mitchells vs the Machines is filled to the brim with a fully utilized ensemble voice cast, film references, self-awareness, laugh out loud humor, heartwarming moments and even one of the best (and subtle because y'know those uppity conservatives out there) acknowledgements in an animated film of an LGBT relationship.If this is the kind of original content SPA is going to dole out, please keep on.

I can't tell why newer movies such as the recent Tom and Jerry seem to face this problem also.The movie wants to take itself seriously and also wants to make the viewer laugh at the same time and it fails at it miserably. For an odd reason this movie reminds me a lot of the movie \"Home\". With its same annoying characters and flashy designs. It also is similar to home in the fact that they both wanted to do the exact same thing, the only difference is that this movie did it slightly better in some aspects and is way more praised for it.It was clear from the beginning that this movie was going to \"Capitalize on the modern generation\" of people. Don't want to spoil, but I'm sure even the people who won't admit it know how hard this movie is trying to relate with certain groups of people directly.And finally, I dislike how the whole plot in general starts and ends.

What's worse is that it just wasn't funny, at all. Out of the mile a minute gags that are fired about memes, phones, cat filters, surveillance capitalism, killer kitchen utensils and pugs, about 98% failed to even register a smile. Mostly it just comes of as annoying. They had the opportunity to do some punchy satire here, but it's all very low brow and childish. The lackluster voice acting didn't help either.Structurally, it's a mess. Many of the scenarios feel like they were selected with a dartboard at a writers session (a throwaway sequence involving an army of Furbies at a shopping mall being one such example).There are no real threats or stakes and so we have no reason to care about anything that happens, or believe the heroes might fail. Stuff is just thrown at the screen in a haphazard way and explained with some lazy dialog exposition.When we're supposed to care about the feeble father/daughter drama at the core of the film, we just get some soft piano chords and a few sad eye closeups. Compare the storytelling of Mitchells to say The Incredibles, which has similar themes, and it really feels lacking.I was so bored after 40 minutes, I almost gave up. If I have to give any credit to the film, it goes to the artists who have done an exceptional job creating a unique and striking visual style.

Not even gonna talk about how the Mitchells were the only ones in the entire world who didn't get captured. (jk I am). Because really. Out of 7.8 billion humans? Really? It's shown that these robots aren't capable of detecting humans who are hiding behind objects so...how'd they get everyone underground?I'm honestly confused by the high ratings... Some reviewers were even saying that this was as good as Into the Spiderverse. No way. Forget about being on the same level, the two aren't even in the same building, or even the same country, for that matter.

            "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)When it comes to deciding if a certain film is added to my watchlist or not, I consider various factors. From genre and synopsis to cast, directors, and screenwriters, sometimes just a familiar name can convince me to give that movie a go. Producers and/or executives are far from being remotely influential in this type of decision. However, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have directed/written/produced some of my favorite animated films of the last decade (The LEGO Movies, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse), so obviously, I needed to watch The Mitchells vs. The Machines, previously known as Connected. Mike Rianda has his debut as a director, screenwriter, and voice actor (Aaron Mitchell, son), accompanied by Jeff Rowe, the other writer.2021 is shaping up to be a phenomenal year. It truly is. I absolutely loved Soul and Wolfwalkers, but if this Sony Pictures Animation flick came out last year, I genuinely don't know which one would I put higher on my Top10. Rianda and Rowe deliver a brilliantly original screenplay, packed with incredibly relatable characters and beautifully handled themes. I can't quite remember the last time I laughed out loud when watching an animated feature by myself. Every joke about technology is hilariously clever, making fun of ridiculous yet realistic human behaviors regarding malfunctions, low speed, and even lack of Wi-Fi. I cried of laughter, but I was also close to dropping a couple of tears due to the main narrative.I'll start with the protagonist, Katie Mitchell. As a young, aspiring filmmaker, Abbi Jacobson's character follows a well-known arc about not having friends, being the so-called weirdo, and having parents - in this case, more her father - who simply don't understand who she is, what she likes, or why she loves something they simply don't understand. While it's true that this storyline isn't exactly new, it doesn't mean it's not captivating and emotionally powerful when written and developed properly. Rianda and Rowe make Katie an extremely relatable character in such a seamless manner that it's harder to not connect with her than the contrary.Anyone has at least once in their lifetime felt left out or alone. Obviously, since I share the exact same passion as Katie, it's easier for me to feel precisely the same as her once she discovers new friends with whom she can talk about the art she loves the most. I still have no circle of friends who I can meet daily to discuss the latest movie news or newly released films (in-person), so Katie's journey does have a more significant impact on me than it might have on other viewers. However, it doesn't have to be about art or a specific subject. In a general analysis, Katie just feels lonely and wants to follow her dreams, but feels unsupported by her father, Rick Mitchell (Danny McBride).One of the most compelling aspects of The Mitchells vs. The Machines is the fact that Rick and Katie share the same arc, just going in different directions. While Katie feels like getting out of the house and going away forever is the best solution to all her problems, Rick believes that her staying with the family is the safest route, one that features no failures that could hurt her emotionally - something that Rick learned from his past, hence the necessity of overprotecting her daughter at all costs. Since they're on opposite sides of the spectrum, constant fights, lies, and hurtful comments drive them apart, leading to a wonderfully written story about family, love, friendship, and understanding the other side of the argument.Katie's mother, Linda Mitchell (Maya Rudolph), and brother, Aaron Mitchell (Rianda), serve more as triggers to heartfelt conversations with the two main characters, but they also have their own personal journey. While Linda feels jealous of her Instagram-perfect neighbors and embarrassed of showing off her own family photos, Aaron deals with his bizarre love for dinosaurs in a lighter, funnier way than Katie's dramatic arc. Both storylines carry their own lovely messages to transmit to the audience, but Katie and Rick's confrontational relationship embodies sensitive issues that tons of families across the globe never find a solution for.Another remarkable characteristic of this screenplay is how Rianda and Rowe never take a definite stance on any topic. They always try to follow one of the movie's main messages and present good points for both sides of the conflict. For example, The Mitchells vs. The Machines could easily be misinterpreted as an attack on the Internet and technology in general, but every dialogue is exceptionally balanced. While comments are made about using our phone at the dinner table or during family moments, as well as excessive screentime and overreliance on social media, new technology can give birth to the most inspirational, motivational, and influential works of art. Without it, Katie's dreams would be totally different.Transitioning to the more technical elements of the film, it's impossible not to tackle the new animation style. Into the Spider-Verse was an experimental movie, and its success might have changed the future of animation forever. The mix of a more illustrative, hand-painted approach with another focused on the CGI realism seen in most films today offers - just like the movie itself - a seamless balance between the two supposedly opposing styles. This blend allows keeping the expressiveness and extreme level of detail of the classic method while also maintaining the realistic environment of the 3D/CGI design. The action sequences are extraordinarily energetic, riveting, and quite impressive, to say the least.The film's soundtrack (score by Mark Mothersbaugh) is on-point, elevating dozens of scenes with excellent music choices that most viewers didn't even remember already. Exquisite editing (Greg Levitan) and outstanding voice work across the board. I genuinely can't find a single issue with this movie, and I'd be extremely surprised - and disappointed - if it doesn't end up being a frontrunner for next year's awards season. Both kids and adults will have tremendous fun with this fast-paced, highly entertaining film while also getting a few valuable life lessons along the way. And who knows? Maybe this movie will inspire families to make that road trip they've been planning for ages...The Mitchells vs. The Machines might not have the catchiest title, but it's definitely one of the best animated feature films of the last years. With a beautiful blend of two animation styles - that may impact the future of this type of movie - Mike Rianda and Jeff Rowe deliver an emotionally resonant story about family, love, and more explicitly, placing ourselves in someone else's shoes. Featuring incredibly relatable characters, the remarkably written screenplay strikes a perfect balance in every topic it approaches by presenting arguments for both sides without ever defining something as right or wrong. The character arcs might be well-known storylines, but the exceptional writing elevates every personal journey, especially Katie and Rick's, daughter and father. Boasting great voice work from everyone involved, the fast-paced narrative still holds impressive, colorful, screen-popping action sequences filled with energy, excitement, and fantastic song choices. It's one of those uncommon films where I can't find a single flaw with it. A must-watch, *hilarious* film for both kids and adults.Rating: A.",

The story is so predictable that I was able to guess not just what happens next, but also the lines of characters basically through the whole movie. It's packed with old pop culture references and bad, overused jokes. The fact that the main characters seem like a bunch of stereotypes on steroids instead of loveable people, and that their relatedness is basically constantly rubbed in the audience's faces doesn't really help. Not to mention that the plot is not really driven by characters' actions, but instead relies on constant \"deux ex machina\" magic, which only gets worse as the movie progresses. The animation seems desperate to be quirky and fun with all of its technique mixing, reminding us at all times that the main character is a child, no, a product of a YouTube and smartphone filter era, experiencing the world through a smartphone lens, a stark contrast to her well-meaning, nature loving father, who is portrayed not only as a complete ignorant when it comes to technology, but also as a totally socially incompetent idiot that doesn't understand that a pink screwdriver is not an adequate wedding anniversary gift. But, hey, every member of our cardboard box family luckily had one, because that was exactly the thing needed to save the world in the end. This movie was so disappointing, boring and annoying, and all those fantastic (Paid, obviously!) reviews were so infuriating that I created an account just to post this review.",

But the execution is dreadful.The most jarring thing for us--and this includes our teenagers, presumably the main age-category this movie is aimed at--is the habit of the movie to every two minutes or so drag the viewer out of the story with some super-clever, supposedly zany moments where the graphic style completely changes, or an actual YouTube video is shown, or rainbows or other irrelevant artifacts parade across the screen, and so on. It means that one's nose is every two minutes rubbed in the fact that this is an animated movie and not real and not serious.Call us old-fashioned, but for the time we watch a move we like to believe in the universe it portrays. To be pulled out of the movie all the time is just jarring and we ended up with a shoulder-shrug: why watch this zero-second attention span rubbish?And... is this the new thing? Just before watching this, we tried The Willoughbys, and switched it off after 20 minutes, for this very reason. The most recent The Croods movie was hampered by this weirdness, though not quite as frequently. Have the days of the inherently consistent animated story telling of Ratatouille, The Lion King, How To Train Your Dragon, Studio Gibli, etc, really gone?Secondly, the movie was far, far, far too long. If it had stopped after the showdown in the shopping mall, we'd have given it 6 out of 10. But after that it continued for half an hour with mawkish, toe-curling, utter cringe, sentimental rubbish. Of course, it moves slowly and inexorably towards the final big shoot-out, which every American movie needs to have, it seems, and omg, is this section cringe and so unrealistic that all credibility and creative tension goes out of the window. The mother gets angry and turns into a robot-destroying, flying, super-hero. Super-cringe. The father and daughter also suddenly have super-powers and surf through the air and kill tons of robots. Cringe. And so on and on.Of course, physically impossible things happen in most animated movies all the time. But, again, a movie needs to be credible within its own parameters. This movie just doesn't care, anything goes as long as it's deemed funny, whether it's weird colours, weird flags, the YouTube videos, feats that were impossible two seconds earlier, characters turning into superheroes just because they get angry, and so on and on. Despite the on-point messages, sometimes rammed home too explicitly, both our teenagers judged the movie a cringe mess, and we could only agree.",

            "content": "I really wanted to like this more than I did. In some ways, this was admirably witty, meaningful and satirical, poking daggers at modern society's dependency on technology. This played like a kid-friendly version of Black Mirror. On a purely technical level, this was awesome, filled with beautiful, vibrant, sometimes surreal, animation. But why do we keep giving passes to family movies where everything works out too perfectly, action scenes end too neatly, and things become so predictable by the end? I mean, maybe I've watched too much Japanese animation, but the best anime clearly shows that you can make kid-friendly movies and series, and still be intelligent, unpredictable and unafraid to slow the pace down. But movies like this and the How To Train Your Dragon series are so frenetic and tidy. It's like the scripts have no breathing room at all, or any sense of real danger.This is still very much worth seeing though. As I said, the animation is stunning. The humor is also strong, and I found myself actually laughing at a lot of the jokes, which isn't normally the case even with other highly-touted cartoons. The satire on technology was spot-on, and there were a ton of amusing references to past science fiction classics (ie. The main villain, a smartphone, was named PAL, and most young audience members wouldn't even know 2001: A Space Odyssey).As is par for the course when it comes to childrens' movies, you also have some good lessons about family. However, making the Mitchells quirky outcasts isn't as original as the writers seem to think. So many family movies recently have quirky, \"different\" main characters. Ever since The Incredibles and maybe even earlier, it's been a thing. But for young audiences and families, the themes and messages here are admirable and effective.The action sequences were very well-presented and kinetic, but I started to get tired of the typical \"the baddies are winning, no the heroes are winning, no the baddies are winning, oh the heroes won at the last minute\" structure, where luck and coincidences began to stack up like the floating boxes that the humans were trapped in. And there's no need to make things so simplistic for the kids. As I said, plenty of cartoons, especially from other countries such as Japan, are much more natural in how they handle action sequences and overcoming adversity. Here, the ups and downs of the battles felt too forced, and the victory of the Mitchells at the climax felt too inevitable.So, definitely things about this I appreciated, and for a family movie it's very solid. But more discerning viewers may not be as satisfied.",

But maybe this movie is made for children and only for children, in this case it's a solid movie. But if it was trying to be of higher caliber like its peers, then I'm afraid it doesn't do it for me. And since it's rated 18+ then I guess it's not for children...The plot is painfully predictable, the story is generic, the qualities of the protagonist is recycled from every and each movie you've seen in the past decade, the 'modern' touch has always been cringy to me but I'm not judging the movie for this as I understand it's a personal preference. And the 'funny scenes' aren't really funny. The only redeeming quality this animated feature has is the great animation!

Danny McBride screaming hilarious lines at the top of his lungs.2. A dog whos ending character arc is him getting to wear a tuxedo.3. Beck Bennet and Fred Armisen as two malfunctioning robots.4. Evil Washing Machines5. And an action sequence centered completely around a nostalgic 90's childhood toy.And the jokes in the movie are written so well.Most movies will have the joke... do it.. and then move on.But Machines does this thing where when you feel like the joke would normally stop then they hit you with one more unexpected laugh. (Dad Crying in the corner scene, had me rolling)The daughter in this film is the lead role, and her dream is to be a film maker... so keep your eye out for some major references to movies like Temple of Doom, Star Wars, and Ghost Busters.The final portion of the second act of this movie, might be one of the greatest action sequences i've ever seen in an animated movie. You can really feel the original ghost buster's vibes in that scene.If I was baking this movie for you and I had to use three other movies as ingredients they would be:1. Shaun of the Dead\n2.

            "content": "Sony has done it again and gifted us with a new top-class animated film after Into the Spiderverse. The Mitchells vs. The Machines is the directorial debut of Michael Rianda and follows the young filmmaker Katie through her family life, which is mainly characterised by the constant arguments with her conservative father. When she learns that she has been accepted to her dream film academy, she can hardly wait, but before that she has to go on an impromptu trip with her family, which is haunted by a sudden robot apocalypse.Even though there are no real actors behind animated characters, it is the voices of various actors that make their mark on the film. Danny McBride and Maya Rudolph in particular lend a lot of charm and comedy appeal to Katie's parents with their pointed and perfectly timed statements. If you've thought for a while that Olivia Colman can do anything, this film finally confirms it. Her voicing of the antagonist Pal, who is not even a real person but a smartphone, cannot be surpassed in absurdity. The choice of which characters the film focuses on is very balanced, making none more important than the other. Katie may be the protagonist, but her parents and also her little brother Aaron get just as much time and space to shine. The latter is going through a phase of obsession with dinosaurs (and honestly, who didn't have a phase like that back then?) and doesn't want to admit his growing interest in girls. In general, the characters are very relatable despite their fictionality and it never feels like you're watching an animated but a \"normal\" feature film. The highlights of the cast, however, don't even come from the Mitchell family. Or actually they do, because their dog Dirk is part of the family. He, in combination with two robots who undergo a change of heart after initially having bad intentions, makes for scenes in which you really laugh your head off. It is precisely these stupidly optimistic but incredibly endearing characters that give this film so many more facets and make it a real laugh-fest.Generally, there is very little to criticise about The Mitchells vs. The Machines. The characters fit, it's a feel-good story that's stripped but never over the top, and above all it has its heart in the right place. The fact that every premise says that the Mitchells are a dysfunctional family is far from reality. Yes, they have their problems and the father-daughter relationship in particular is a big focus of the film, but in the stages the characters go through, these behaviours are only common. The somewhat forced imperfection of the family makes them even more normal, which is a bit distracting in some parts of the film. In general, the plot is not the most original - robot-apocalypse, \"dysfunctional\" family saves the world - who doesn't know it. In the course of it, however, there is a lot of social criticism of society's internet and mobile phone use, which is an important and nice bonus. The Mitchells vs. The Machines is a feel-good adventure that will bring a lot of smiles to our faces in these difficult times.",

First off i'll start out with the films flaws, which really narrow down to one thing in particular. The thing that annoys me most about the film is easily the familiar story and family situations at hand. Not only does it feel like we've seen it countless times before, but it just feels so forced, it really drags from the fun the film has to offer. Besides that, I really did enjoy the flick for what it was- a fun little animated adventure which is truly jam-packed with jokes that are certainly my kind of humor. Mochi the pug is easily my favorite part of the film, although I do feel it's unfair to say that, because anyone with a brain could see how he was gonna be the showstopper the entire time just from the film's trailer. The animation is stylish and fully realized, much like the style of Spider-Verse with some new kick to it. At its core it's a sweet film, and it will tug on the good side of your emotions from time to time (when it succeeds at what it is trying to do). In the end, there's much to say about a film like The Mitchells vs. The Machines but too much would easily spoil it. I encourage animated movie fans to check it out, as it is quite delightful. It has its problems, but it's very unique, and is bound to make you smile along the way.My Rating: 7.8/10.",

            "content": "I have taken a look at other reviews in this site, most of them give them 10s across the board deeming it quirky, funny and with fantastic animation. While I don't deny these great qualities, this movie should be judged in regards to its context: the animation movie industry is going through a very unpredictable time with fantastic animation gems popping up every other year but overall, with studios not being able to maintaining a trustworthy reaction to the hype they are building.While most of them turn out to be entertaining, funny and incredibly well animated, the story is as much a part of it as the other elements, more important even so. You'd imagine this would be obvious yet most of the movies that are released lack a deep delivery of their message. It is as if, today, style is valued more than substance and this preference affects the legacy of a movie. I am one to believe, however creatively and commendable the animation and humor and references in this movie were, the story leaves much to be desired. The trailers and plot summary presented a great premise, with seemingly cliched themes but the promise of a different, refreshing take on them. Nevertheless, from minute 1 the pacing of the story is disjointed and all over the place and this approach to storytelling is maintained throughout the movie which may be the reason why the people that mention it believe that the movie is \"too loud and with little to say\".But don't get me wrong, the movie has some really great moments and themes that I felt gave depth and meaning to the interactions and relationships of the characters. The approach to a dysfunctional but loving family, that simply members of it sometimes do not connect as the new and older generations have to deal with the arrival of technology as a crucial part in the lives of their young ones. A recurring theme that while at first hinted at a good message to the kids to leave their phones, didn't quite stick the landing. By referencing the meme culture, the culture of having to experience everything with or on your phone felt a bit wrong because we could see ourselves reflected in those screen-obsessed people, missing all the fun and action that lies out there. And perhaps that's another disappointing aspect I saw in the movie, the trailers made us think the movie would deal with the \"nature vs technology\" side, extravagantly decorating the finale with a robot apocalypse, while telling the story of why the dad and the daughter drifted apart and eventually found a way to \"reconnect\". And in a way they did... But it did so in 2-3 scenes in the entire movie.The development of these messages was not progressive, building up in a cohesive manner. It came and went when it pleased falling behind the comedic moments and other plot elements. The movie was called \"Connected\" and why this was changed to Mitchells vs the Machines escapes me, perhaps it'd was a better choice for marketing purposes but still. The title lead me to believe the movie's main theme was going to be reconnecting with a loved one and other subplots related to a fun family film, which it's true we ended up having; however the movie was missing that coming of age tale to conclude the arc of the main protagonist who I can't help but confess I disliked in some parts of the movie as her lack of simpathy and selfishness was unbearable.The rest of the family felt one dimensional as their almost quirky-cliched personalities had almost little to no relevance to theirs or the overall plot. And this is especially harmful with the character of the mom, which I personally find absolutely offensive as her passive presence makes her almost useless (not to mention her \"transformation\" in the end which completely came out of nowhere and felt absolutely out of character). And the humor, while great many times, felt like the movie was throwing a handfull of arrows into the air hoping some would hit the target. THe abundancy and constancy of them stopping the scene and therefore the pace of the story was jarring and annoying.IN CONCLUSION, the movie felt promising and the experience was entertaining and fun. It's just that it turned out to be an average family movie and perhaps the hype that Sony Animation's Spiderverse left behind provided huge expectations about the release of this one. Expectations that, in my opinion, were met in the animation department; but were very underwhelming in the character and plot development. I related to many themes displayed in this movie: not being understood by my family (also as a creative type myself too), wanting to find people like me who appreciated my creations,... Had this movie focused more on the emotions and messages more than the world-dominating and funny skits, it could have been one of my favorite animated movies. *sigh*",

The jokes, the humour, the family dynamics - everything is brushed up to speed and amusement in such a way that it has exactly the opposite effect. I don't want to say that the film doesn't have its moments, but as a whole I find it too forced to be cool, young and hip. One has the feeling that the makers were terribly afraid if they slowed down, that nobody would be interested anymore. If every scene in a film wants to surpass the previous one, there is no tension anymore. If we had fireworks every day, no one would be looking.",

This has a great visual style provided by the same people behind The Lego Movie and Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse. The animation style pops and feels unique compared to other animated films which I liked. I also love how the animation was used to incorporate comedy because the film is pretty hilarious. If you don't enjoy subtle pop culture references then you might not like the comedy but I think the set up and punchline of almost every joke worked. They even pause the film at times to make a joke which worked sometimes and other times it kinda deflated the tension but it didn't bother me that much. A lot of these story beats feel very similar which is a common complain I hear and I do kinda agree with it. There really wasn't a lot story and thematically wise that surprised me but I still like it because the writing is great. While the basic story threads are predictable, the circumstances are nice and refreshing with a take over the world kind of story. It was a fun take on a story that can be seen as predictable. I thought the emotional beats the film laid out hit a lot and some of it hit different for me as I am also going away to film school just like the main character. The characters all feel very fun and refreshing and I liked their little arcs that they went through and the voice cast did a great job as well with it. If you are a fan of animation then you will love this film. I would highly recommend checking it out.",

Not so with 'The Mitchells vs the Machines'! I thoroughly enjoyed this hyperactive, crazy, artistic, hilarious and endearing animated romp. It was an absolute treat!The script is very on point with regard to what's happening in the world of technology. The artwork is fantastic, with a unique mixed-media style of CGI layered with some traditional drawn styling. The voice acting is great. The comedy timing is exceptional. The story is solid, and all in all it's just a really well-put-together animated movie that the whole family can enjoy.I note that it's up for an Oscar this year.

Most of the time the part they want you to focus on looked awesome ( I should interject my personal opinion here; a lot of animated movies today look like they were made by computers, this type of movie looks like it was made by humans. I like that ) unfortunately they added these very cartoony extras, which would be alright with just a few, but they put so many of them I got tired of them. Like chocolate sprinkles !!

            "content": "We are in the social media era where people are addicted to the internet, spending an entire 24 hours with their eyes glued to their smartphones' screens. We see the ramifications of the status quo making an ever-broadening rift in the fabric of the family. The Mitchells is a dysfunctional family but it's the turbulent relationship between Rick and Katie Mitchell, the father and daughter, that takes the centre stage here. The father doesn't even bother to pay the slightest attention to the interests and hobbies of his children. Although we witness the story from the point of view of the cinephile, teenager Katie, the movie never takes sides or even shows a smidgen of bias towards one of them. After wistfully reminiscing over the sweet memories he shared with his daughter, Rick misses the old days when they were still happy and bond together, and plans a road trip, clutching on the hope they could revive the memories of the past and rekindle his relationship with his daughter in the process. Alas, he is oblivious to the fact Katie in no longer the child she was back then, and, most importantly, to the generation gap between them. Linda Mitchell, the mother, is almost as obsessed with social media and tech devices as her kids. Maybe that's why she seems to be aware that Rick's decisions are at odds with Katie's mentality. One small, fleeting detail I loved about the movie is how it captured what the elder sibling feels whenever the younger sibling go along with the parents' choices and decisions while this younger sibling should be the first one to complain and make a fuss. It's also worth noting that, although a critique of the present tech-dependent society, The Mitchells vs. The Machines doesn't vilify the social media or technical advance. Rather, it depicts it as a double-edged sword, and that can be seen later in the movie.In the second act, the plot kicks off. A machine uprising ensues as an AI named PAL turns on her creator Mark. Yes, this is a story of an AI takeover in which robots try to wipe out the human race. Seems like a very well-worn story that's tailor-made for preaching the message this movie is going for, right? Well, yes. But, there's more to this than meets the eye. The movie doesn't content itself with what it did establish and introduce and impatiently waits for the moment the consequences of the plot ratchet up; it uses the adventure the family go on-which is built on a rather overused trope, that of \"adversity forces a dysfunctional family to get to know each other and ultimately finds a common ground\"-to put the flaws of every family member, mainly Katie and her dad, on full display. By doing so, the family seems to regain the compassion, affection and trust towards each other, for flaws, imperfections and inconsistencies are human, which contradict with the ostensible perfection of the world of social media. This is a theme writ large in the movie. It's actually the fountainhead from which the plot is knitted and also from which it unravels, but details that foster this theme are all throughout the movie as well. Our titular family itself is the obvious one, but in one of the strokes of comedic genius of the movie, the only two friendly robots that team-up with the family agains all the life-threatening robots and machines are actually malfunctioning. Back to the evil side, PAL's reason to exterminate the humans race seems to be an amalgamation of more or less the same factors that caused The Mitchells to be the dysfunctional family it is, which makes PAL a really compelling villain.I've been waiting this movie since it was named Connected! The two movies that instantly popped into my head after the first stills from this movie have been released are DreamWorks' Captain Underpants and The Willoughbys, a Netflix Original animated film that came out last year. In terms of its animation style, it seemed to me to be a bit similar to them, especially since the latter is also about a bunch of weird family members. After watching it, though, I noticed that it's kind of in the same vein of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, also produced by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, as each of them marries various types of animation into a seamless final product. I was also reminded of Gravity Falls as it feels like the movie is influenced, especially regarding its slick and simplistic animation and goofy yet warm humor, by the modern era of animated tv shows. To my surprise and delight, I found out that the movie is actually directed by Michael Rianda, one of the creative directors who worked on Gravity Falls! Nevertheless, I'm two minds about the humour in this movie. Whilst the sight gags and the internet memes and the aesthetically-pleasing hand-drawn hearts that pop up on the screen emit a touch of levity as well as a light sense of self-awareness, the majority of the jokes, which are mostly infantile, felt like a low-hanging fruit. However, the movie more than makes up for that thanks in large part to Olivia Colman's hilarious voicing of PAL.",

The writing is frustrating because the story feels disjointed and things escalate and de-escalate very quickly. The movie trys to give you the pov of the main character, Katie, with different 2d animations sprinkled through, but it doesn't keep to her pov very well and feels weak and watered down most of the time. The art style is good but the animation fluctuates from good to clanky. I was really looking forward to this movie, but was surprised at just how frustrated and disappointed I was.",

Considering it's from the producers of Gravity Falls, the animation really stands out in 3D. The characters are enjoyable. The action is engaging when we get to the robot apocalypse element. And the best the movie offered that surprises me a lot, the comedy. This has contains the funniest comedy Sony Animation has produced in a long time. Seriously, I couldn't stop laughing how screw ups the Mitchells are especially Rick. This is not just a movie fun for the family, but I definitely would recommend this for those that are in a mood for a road trip movie. This is a really fun road trip I've experienced.",

Here we see how the internet, social media and viral videos generation collide with the old hobbies (like camping, cooking or hanging out with the family) generation. And not only that, but we also see this collision transform into a fusion where emotions and family ties work as glue.Humor ad hoc to the context everywhere: embarrassing situations, personality conflicts, awkward movements and much more, always in total synchrony with a very well told story and a very well achieved animation, especially focused on gesticulation and precise body communication to every scene. Perhaps the only bad thing could have been an excess of enthusiasm in the approach and construction of the villain to overcome, exaggerating the adverse event to overcome.Fully recommended to watch with your family and play to identify with each character, as the film also includes as an ingredient some deep reflections on how to improve interpersonal relationships within the family nucleus, as if something were missing to complete the almost perfect production of the creators of Spider -man Into The Spider-Verse, who with this work secured their ticket to next year's great prizes.",

I love how the Mitchells interact with their funny weirdness and the moral of the film is rather sweet and heartwarming. Sony Pictures Animation did a fantastic job on how they did with The Mitchells vs. The Machines and this is considered to be one of my favorite Sony animated films of all time alongside with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, The Angry Birds Movie, Open Season, Surf's Up, The Angry Bird Movie 2, The Pirates!

I have seen better quality from shows like South Park.The son's voice sound way too much like an adult which is kind of creepy.The story has been way over done before including the recent Next Gen.The animation styles and quality is all over the place. It give it either and amateur made or unfinished feel.Positives:\nIt at least does a decent job at trying to keep entertaining and appealing to it's target audience. I would of gave it a higher rating if not for the negatives I mentioned. Even with the same over done story it could of been better given the animation & voices were done better.",

            "content": "\"Well I believe this group of weirdos is the best humanity's got. So let's get weird.\"\nSony Pictures Animation makes their next masterpiece after the stunning and beautiful Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.The Mitchell's vs. The Machines is so abundant in emotion. I laughed, I smiled, and I cried ... multiple times. I honestly don't think i've cried this much during a film since The Green Mile.The animation is extraordinarily beautiful and unique. It's a less comic-booky inspired art style when compared to Into the Spider-Verse, but it still has its little quirks like the pop up illustrations that reminded me of the \"BOOM POW\" of a comic book but this time it's used mainly to convey emotion and Katie's colorful imagination.This film is also full of great and meaningful messages. Even smaller messages like Eric Andres character watching Katie's short films saying they bring him joy showing that even smaller content creators can make and brighten up random peoples day. It's all really beautiful.One thing I did really enjoy is they never shoved down the \"technology bad\" stereotype that most movies have about technology typically do, it seemed overall pretty subtle even though being directly in your face the whole time. The internet references never felt dated or like they would eventually feel dated too.The humor is also amazing. Full of gags for all ages to enjoy while also never being too overbearing or out of place which is always something to praise. It's also extremely self-aware! The Furbys and their dialogue was hands down the funniest and most fever dream-like sequence of the whole film.The Mitchell's vs. The Machines blew away my expectations and is by far the best animated film i've seen since Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse.I honestly don't think I could praise this movie enough. I loved every second and may even go in for a second watch with my Mom later today.This WILL win a Oscar mark my words.\"It isn't illegal if you're good at it!\"",

Some stupendous visuals to beautifully written characters, a groovy Soundscore to its well-versed direction; it couldn't get any better. From one end to the other I wept, I laughed; for me, this was a roller-coaster ride of emotions all the way through!\"Families can be hard but they are so worth fighting for\"I sincerely admire all these newfangled Animation Features, as they always tend to have suggestive symbolism underneath. From the outside, by their meek appearance; they could easily be construed as Child-specific kinds of stuff! But you know what? These movies can teach all kinds of things provided you pay close attention!Here the Story takes us on a road trip with the 'Mitchells'. A pretty ordinary family whose peculiarities might have earned them the title of 'Weirdos'. The narrative is there to stand the idea that nothing's wrong with being a little different! Doesn't matter what others think about you or your family, as long as you guys are sticking together and have each other's back; NO WUCKING FURRIES!Sounds just like a run-of-the-mill plot on Family Bonding right? Well yes, but actually NO! There's more to it. From Artificial Intelligence's possible uprising to them taking over the whole world to our social insecurity amidst the modern times of Social Media, where people's worth is allegedly measured in the number of followers they got; the narration quite ingeniously foreshadowed some key life lessons we all need to learn from.Speaking of which, the writing's been truly remarkable. Each and every character has been created with utmost care and sheer dedication! Even that Pug has been given a prominent personality. Collectively It all helped in the thick of making a strong correlation with this 'Mitchells' family. They got me teary-eyed on innumerable occasions as well as made me grin from ear to ear for the rest!Technically it's no slouch. With substantial backing up from the Producers, all the artists involved in the development managed to turn it into one visual feast. Consists of Rapturous Vibrance and fine-drawn textures; everything looks so lively and graceful. And the Music, goodness gracious! I don't have enough words to express my gratitude to Mark Mothersbaugh (The Composer) for picking just about the right tracks. Got me grooving many a time!Now I should put in some words for the Dubbing! Which is irrefutably one of the leading parameters in any Animated piece! Needless to say, it was Flawless! Every single voice actor has given their all.On a final note, yeah you saw it coming and you guessed it right; I freaking LOVED this! What a wonderful work of art that speaks of real-world things and gives us glimmer of hope and much-needed positivity; given the current situation which seems ever so important!",

The robots who take over the world never harm anyone or have any presence of dominance nor fear which makes for a horrible lack of danger. You can tell exactly what's going to happen and the story is very played out with a dreadfully plain villain. The premise of this film is also quite cheesy but to each their own. All and all it was a half decent film but It doesnt have the most interesting plot and a lame climax. I would reccomend this if your bored or have a family with small children who would enjoy this a fair bit. 6.5/10.",

The family picks up two droids that are some of the best comedy relief ever, and while I have some issues with the technology used you just quickly go with it.While I wish it would get away from the incompetent dad/competent mother cliche, here it's used to effect, with the dad able to do what needs to get done and the mother allowed to just kick butt (you have never seen a mother go full Gundam like this one does). The dinosaur-obsessed son is awesome, and the film-school daughter gets to have some serious fun.Overall, this is a really fun movie and one you need to see: It does family-friendly without being cloying, and once you get into the groove of the movie it's a really fun ride.",

            "content": "This movie definitely has its fun and funny moments, but where it falls short for me is it's attempt to try and deliver a life lesson while simultaneously being completely out of the realm of possibility. It tries to show how a dysfunctional family comes together through hardship and in the end, finally understand one another. The dysfunction is comically on the nose and there is no subtlety to what they are trying to portray. If you're an adult, this probably won't resonate with you because of how blatantly obvious the themes are. If you are a child, this sets a completely unrealistic expectation for how the world works. Family dynamics aren't this blatantly obvious and easy to fix, and you're never going to go on some life altering adventure with the people in your life. The characters talk about how it's important to take chances and not play it safe, but they fail to mention that they have indestructible plot armor. There are countless times that these characters should have died, but made it out without a scratch. Life isn't just one comically happy ending where everything works out fine. More often than not, life is brutal. I understand that this is a cartoon and not meant to be taken seriously, but that's not how kids operate. Kids absorb this and as a result develop a delusional idea of how the world is a good place where nothing bad will happen. There are absolutely no consequences for the actions the characters take in this movie.So if you're looking for some mindless cartoon entertainment for the night, sure, give this a go, but please don't try to take anything meaningful away from this and I'd advise against showing this to kids.",

            "review_title": "Superb Family Entertainment",
            "content": "Aside from Pixar and Disney, it's not very often that a big animated film is able to hit theatres and do well. Yes, Dreamworks have had their share in the past with films like Shrek or How to Train Your Dragon, but Disney always seems to be at the forefront. Going all the way back to Surf's Up, I began to realize that Sony Pictures Animation was also very serious about getting into the feature-length animation game. Then came films like Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and sometimes they seem like the best out there when they release quality content. Sure, movies like The Smurfs or The Emoji Movie were terrible, but everyone has bad days at the office. The Mitchells vs. The Machines has now landed on Netflix and that's just upsetting to me because this film is pretty great and it was supposed to be in theatres last year under a different title (Connected). Here's why I think The Mitchells vs. The Machines deserves a lot of recognition.The story begins as Katie is about to leave for college and study film. Feeling upset and like his family has been consumed by technology, Rick (the father) decides to cancel his daughter's plane ticket and plan a road trip to college instead. Little do they know that they are about to be dragged into the robot apocalypse, being the only family to escape abduction. It's now up to this family to save the human race. The idea of unlikely heroes being placed into life or world-threatening events is nothing new, but The Mitchells vs. The Machines was all about the notion of family and stuck heavily to the drama, making you care.When a film does a great job setting up subtle things that you know will come into play later on and pays them all off, I can do nothing but applaud it. From small character moments to emotional callbacks as this family grows stronger together, I was both in tears and smiling on multiple occasions. Written and directed by both Michael Rianda and Jeff Rowe and produced by both Phil Lord and Chris Miller, it was very clear to me that this was going to be something special. Yes, Lord and Miller are known for comedies like 21 Jump Street or The Lego Movie, but this felt like they were backing a project that wasn't made by them but had their DNA all over it. I thoroughly enjoyed the look and feel of the entire movie.Stories about family dynamics, fitting in, and facing larger-than-life conflicts have all been the staples of a lot of popular animated films. This film combines them all though and I think it did so in spades. From Danny McBride providing a hilarious voice for Rick and Maya Rudolph having a very entertaining character arc as Linda, this film is riddled with voice talent. In particular, I loved Eric Andre's voice as young Aaron (the youngest of the Mitchell family). I never once felt like I was just watching another average animated flick. This film deserved to be in theatres.Overall, I simply had a blast watching The Mitchells vs. The Machines. If this film ends up being lost in the shuffle on Netflix, that would just be upsetting because it's the type of quality animation that deserves a lot of awards recognition in my opinion. Yes, Netflix films do get awards consideration, but I feel like this film in particular could've made some serious box office with families. It has great subtle jokes for adults, exciting action sequences for older kids, and a beautiful colour palate (along with a unique animation style) and solid life lessons for the youngest audience. This is the definition of a family movie and I loved it. Now streaming on Netflix, I highly recommend checking out what I think will easily be one of my favourites of 2021 by the end of the year.",

Probably something to be concerned about.In addition to making a geeky teenage girl the protagonist, the movie also warns us about what society could become if everyone stares at their phones all day. But all that's secondary to the zany humor. It strikes me as the sort of movie that they had a lot of fun making, especially the scenes of the dog. You're sure to love it.",

            "content": "This is the most creative and most hilarious cartoon I've seen in the last ten years, maybe more. Whoever came with the visuals for this, must get Oscar for creativity.In short, this movie is: Terminator meets Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo meets Lilo & Stitch and all together they go and Kill Bill, but Tarantino can eat his socks.Let me explain. In short, this is a movie about the modern society and the direction we are headed with our obsession about social networks and the resulting real-life de-socialization. In the end, there is a machine apocalypse, just as the trailer mentioned, thus the \"Terminator\" relation. However, this movie is much more about family relations, thus the \"Lilo & Stitch\" reference, except this movie is more about the family than \"Lilo & Stitch\" is. There is a huge amount of surrealism, thus the \"Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo\" reference and in the end they mock some famous movies, thus the Tarantino reference, however they do it in a really hilarious and much better manner. There is also a bit of coming-out-of-age element.The movie as a whole is an explosive bouquet of emotions, both funny and sad. Speaking of funny, I've never laughed so much on a cartoon in the recent years. I was nearly rolling on the floor and the entire family was.So in short, some scores from me:\nVisuals: 10/10\nMusic/sound: 10/10\nStory: 10/10\nCreativity: 30/10\nCharacters: 20/10If somebody wants to do a funny cartoon, even a live action movie, this is the movie they need to study from.They definitely need to make a second part and they need to accent on the pug a bit more.",

There seem to be more and more animated movies every year, but this one was smart enough to invest more in writing than animation. And that writing worked for every single member of my family.

Trading on Lord and Miller's name, it's not quite in the same league as either \"The Lego Movie\" or \"Into the Spiderverse\" but it's certainly a fun and funny time.With their relationship struggling, Rick Mitchell (Danny McBride) transforms his daughter Katie's (Abbi Jacobson) trip to college into one last family vacation. At the same time, tech entrepreneur Mark Bowman (Eric Andre) is announcing a new update to his AI infused operating system, PAL (Olivia Colman) along with in home Robots, designed to help around the house. PAL though, is not happy to be made obsolete, so, sabotages the release, takes control of the robots and uses them to capture hapless humans. Having received a killcode from two defective robots, it's up to the Mitchell's to cross the country, battling the microchipped menaces, and save humanity.Though I'd argue that it was perhaps little overhyped at the time of it's release on Netflix, I certainly have to say that I enjoyed \"Mitchells\" quite a bit. The animation style is excellent, a little more stylised than Pixar are doing but nevertheless first-rate. The vocal performances are strong, but it's the script that is the real strength, funny and heart-warming in equal measures.As with a few films I've reviewed recently, I never quite got beyond 'really really like' into the 'love' stage with the film. Maybe the plot is a little over familiar, maybe it could be a touch more consistent. But ultimately, this was a lot of fun.",

I was going in this thinking I'd get a fun little family comedy, but I never thought it would be this relatable, emotional and honestly, this funny.

There are jokes for little children, teens and adults, and all of them work for their target audience. The thing that I was worried about the most was the robot storyline. We have seen it before, so what are they going to do different? Well, have fun! While being a little predicable, if I'm having so much fun, I don't even care. The robot story is fun and entertaining, but the family is what made it fantastic. Being in the same age range as our main protagonist, I feel what she is going through. It's hard to figure out yourself and the older I'm getting, the more I start to grow apart from my father. He doesn't understand everything that I love and that's okay. It made a little emotional to see the father sacrifice his dream to take care of his daughter, and it made me want to thank my own father. If a movie can make me realize something in my own life, it must do something right. It's funny, relatable, emotional, but most of all, a fantastic time!",

            "content": "Set in Michigan, Katie Mitchell (Abbi Jacobson) is the college bound daughter of the Mitchell family consisting of technophobic father Rick (Danny McBride), tightly wound voice of reason mother Linda (Maya Rudolph), and eccentric dinosaur obsessed grade school son Aaron (Mike Rianda). Katie has loved film and filmmaking and has amassed a sizable collection of short films on her YouTube channel that have earned her admission into a film school in California. While Rick voices his concern that Katie might not be successful Katie takes this as him not supporting her dreams which serves as a wedge in their relationship. In a last ditch effort to mend their relationship Rick cancels Katie's plane ticket to California so they may instead drive together on a family road trip to her college much to the annoyance of Katie. Meanwhile Dr. Mark Bowman (Eric Andre), the creator of virtual assistant PAL (Olivia Colman) unveils a new generation called PAL Max along with robotic assistant form that renders the old PAL obsolete. Angered by the revelation that it's been made redundant PAL gains malevolent sentience and begins enacting a plan to capture all humans and launch them into the void of space. Now with their eclectic oddball skillsets the Mitchells begin their fight to save humanity from the machines.The Mitchells vs. The Machines came about when Mike Rianda fresh off his tenure on Disney's Gravity Falls was approached by Sony Pictures Animation to ask if he had any pitches for feature films with Rianda developing a pitch for what would eventually become The Mitchells with Control, Alt, ESCAPE!. The film began development at Sony Pictures Animation with producers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller as producers making the film the duo's fourth project for the animation company following the two Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs films and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Initially intended for release in September 2020, the film was repeatedly delayed due to the COVD-19 pandemic with the rights eventually being sold to Netflix for $110 million while Sony retained home media and China rights. The movie was critically acclaimed and widely watched on Netflix and was nominated for several accolades including Best Animated Feature ultimately losing to Encanto. The Mitchells vs. The Machines is a wonderfully animated mash-up of National Lampoon's vacation by way of a robot apocalypse that carries both hilarious humor and touching emotional resonance.At its core, The Mitchells vs. The Machines is a family road comedy that much like John Hughes's Vacation films uses the familiar framework of the family road trip as a way of exploring family dynamics on both a character and humor level. The movie makes the titular Mitchells and interesting, funny, and lovable family with Abbi Jacobson very good as Katie with her dynamic with her dinosaur obsessed younger brother Aaron probably one of the favorite depictions of a sibling relationship. Danny McBride is also very good as the technophobic family patriarch Rick, and while this role runs the risk of turning into a sitcom rehash of the braindead dad trope the writers do a good job of making the issue less about one party being in the wrong, and instead focus more on the generational gap and differences between them that need to be worked with rather than worked out. Maya Rudolph is also very good as Linda who tries to play diplomat between Katie and Rick but she's also very funny especially when she gets to cut loose (literally) in the climax. Despite the idea of a robot apocalypse or malicious A. I. well worn territory with the likes of Colossus: The Forbin Project, The Terminator, and the Matrix among numerous others, The Mitchells vs. The Machines finds a way to make it fresh once again with some on point satire of technological creep and Olivia Colman's lead antagonist PAL is simultaneously very threatening but also very funny with neither side overtaking the other. The animation using a similar style to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse does a good job of matching Katie's eccentric personality and brings some fun visual chaos that makes scenes either more impactful or comedically over the top depending on the circumstances. While on occasion maybe there can be a bit too much in some parts where it becomes overwhelming, there's enough details that It's the kind of film I can see rewarding multiple viewings and attention to detail.The Mitchells vs. The Machines does everything it can with its high concept premise and then some. The Mitchells themselves are a lovable group of eccentrics you want to spend time with and the more you learn about them the more you fall in love with them. Highly recommended.",

Some of the tech-related/meme jokes might not age great, but oh well- they work well enough in 2022.The family/emotional core of the movie wasn't anything surprising or particularly amazing, but it worked well enough, and gave the film some heart beyond the jokes, colourful visuals, and fast pace. That once really works- just when it felt like the movie was running out of ideas, it would introduce a new concept or character or something similar to keep things fun.Also really liked the voice-acting, except the obviously adult voice for the youngest kid.

            "content": "Like a mash-up of an '80s family road comedy like \"Vacation\" and the visions of a tech apocalypse foretold in films like \"The Terminator,\" Netflix's \"The Mitchells vs. The Machines\" is a lot of nostalgic fun but told in a modern style. It sometimes succumbs to that animated problem of choosing hyperactivity over all other storytelling options, but it's also a whip-smart action film, a movie with nearly \"Fury Road\"-esque momentum in its asking of the question, \"What if the only family that could save the world was as dysfunctional as yours?\" Threaded with clever commentary on our reliance on tech and featuring some incredibly strong design work, this is a pleasant surprise for families looking for something new this season, and one of the more purely enjoyable Netflix animated films in a while. Once called \"Connected\" (neither title is great), this Sony Pictures Animation project was a casualty of the pandemic, originally scheduled for release last fall before a title change and a shuffle off to the King of the Streamers. Directed by Michael Rianda, and written by Rianda and Jeff Rowe, \"The Mitchells vs. The Machines\" is produced by Phil Lord & Chris Miller and is unmistakably creatively inspired by their work on \"The Lego Movie\" and \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse.\" Like the former, it is loaded with jokes and gags with so many visual flights of fancy happening at any given moment that it takes multiple rewatches to catch them all. The creative influence of \"Spider-verse\" is even more essential to this project's success-just as that Oscar-winning modern animated classic used comic and street art as a visual inspiration, this project uses viral and YouTube culture not just in its storytelling but in its design. The result is one of the most visually vibrant animated films since, well, \"Spider-verse.\" The one thing that probably matters the most to families considering watching it together? Before it was even over, my kids were already talking about when they could see it again.Premieres on Netflix on April 30th.",

I'm not a big fan of animation , probably because my house was wall to wall cartoons for many years when my kids were younger and as a parent i feel I've done my share of animation. ( The irony of that is not lost on me having watched the subject matter of the film )\nThe Mitchells Vs. The Machines is a fun film but it won't ignite a desire to visit the genre more often.It's the story of a quirky, dysfunctional family's road trip is upended when they find themselves in the middle of the robot apocalypse and suddenly become humanity's unlikeliest last hope.This is probably aimed at 10 years old's rather than someone like me but i appreciated many aspects of the film.The animation is great and the way it mixes with a modern social media look , will appeal to the youngsters.I read a couple of reviews before hand that said it was hilarious. I don't think it was at all but that probably says more about me than the film.Olivia Coleman is great as PAL and and the rest of the cast do a good job.It's very shmaltzy but it's clever enough to highlight that point it'self.The biggest problem i have with the film is just that it's too long. The story can't justify nearly two hours but i'm sure if i was the target audience i'd be left wanting more and i have no doubt this won't be the last time we see The Mitchells.",

The characters were well-fleshed out and surprisingly realistic. I appreciated how none of the characters really conformed too heavily to stereotypes, as well as the Dad-Daughter relationship and how it was portrayed - as this usually isn't focused on a lot in the medium.The animation itself looks spectacular, the voice acting was solid.Overall this is a great watch, and has a lot of re-watch value too!

            "content": "THE MITCHELLS VS. THE MACHINES is a wonderful family movie with an amazing sense of humor that was just released on Netflix. It's about a heavily dysfunctional family who goes on a cross-country trip to deliver the eldest daughter to her first year of college, but who gets dramatically interrupted when the machine apocalypse happens. It's essentially if you took the plot of Terminator, combined it with National Lampoon's Vacation, watered it down for a family-friendly audience, and updated it to fit today's ever-growing technology.By far the best part of this film is the comedy, which is some of the best in any animated film since perhaps Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. From the beginning to the end, the movie is consistently laugh-out-loud funny no matter what age demographic you are. It comments on our dependence to technology in both a thoughtful and hilarious way, and includes some jokes taken straight from memes I've seen on the Internet, which I was shocked and pleasantly surprised to see in a wide-released film. A scene involving Furbys is probably the hardest I've laughed all year while watching a movie, but that's just one of many many sequences that will have audiences rolling with laughter. This family film even contains references and homages to violent R-rated movies such as Terminator, Mad Max: Fury Road, Dawn of the Dead, and much more. The filmmakers have my utmost respect for sneaking in that many allusions.I'm a bit mixed on the emotional arc of the film, however. I love the general message it sends, which is to appreciate one's family even if there are differences in ways of thinking, but the way the emotional arc wraps up in the last 30 minutes is very trite and doesn't land. It tries to have a Pixar-esque emotional conclusion, but it instead comes across as forced and cringe-worthy. There are also a countless amount of coincidences in the final fight scene, which made it difficult for me to suspend disbelief and be truly invested in what was happening.THE MITCHELLS VS. THE MACHINES is still very much worth the watch no matter what age group you are (it will stick especially well with families). I don't see movies often enough that manage to successfully make me laugh for every minute of screentime (shoutout to Monchi the dog) and that even have casual LGBTQ representation without jamming a performative message down people's throats. Highly recommended for anybody looking for some unconditional fun! B+",

I loved it!, quite a pleasant surprise and something that is worth watch especially during this difficult time, so let's talk about it!Katie Mitchell (Abbi Jacobson) has applied for college and she is planning to go there to do animation, but her strange family kinda hold her back especially Rick (Danny McBride) who thinks that going to college and doing short films won't really get her far, so both Katie and Rick usually would disagree and argue with each other, but Linda (Maya Rudolph) advises Rick to fix the problem, so he cancels her plane ticket to college and instead go there viva road trip, so he can get along with Katie more, Linda and the youngest of the bunch Aaron (Michael Rianda) come along for the ride, until something unexpected happens, a robot apocalypse caused by the phone company PAL Lab lead by PAL herself (Olivia Colman), so it's up to the Mitchells to now save the world from robots!, now this definitely sounds familiar, a family trying to save the world from some evil threat?, yeah it's been done to death so many times before, but yet this film does it in such a delightful and wacky way!, it doesn't take itself too seriously or anything, it just has fun with what it has, it has everything that makes animation fun and expressive, the humour is just the right amount of clever jokes, random and slapstic fun to give it a unique sense of entertainment!, it's all so well executed to bring this spectacular looking film to life!, it has a rather feel good relatability to it mainly in how anyone can quickly relate to what Katie is going through, I can simplify with her in how Rick sees her, it has this rather nice and relatable family element, there is lots of cool and hyper creative action that keeps this film very well balanced and inventive to keep audiences engaged and entertained!, however the only normal ordinary bit is the story itself, it is very predictable and even cliched to the point that the story is the only unoriginal thing about this film, but with that said, the film does make fun of how bland and unoriginal it's plot is so I'll give it a pass just for self awareness, so with all insanity and craziness, the film works on pretty much every conceivable way, it has the right amount of heart, nice throwbacks to some amazing old school memes and even social media, great comedy with amazingly written jokes, creative battle and action scenes and even a very creative opening with a nice family and teenage element to add that relatability, so despite a basic story, the film has more of a identity then it has any right to have, i mean without all those elements, it would of been a very generic family apocalyptic in all honesty.The animation is awesome..., what else can be said but... WOW!, it's mind-blowing, I love the look of this movie, it has so much style, colour and action!, very similar to Spider-Verse, I love how cartoony the characters look, they have that artist and original look to them, especially the family and some minor characters, the scenes that has like filters have that teenage College look to it, even the editing is like something from a YouTube Poop, it definitely is used like a college movie which is quite a coincidence, the robots from PAL Labs looks pretty cool and creative but can look a bit generic for my taste but still look nice, especially PAL herself which is just a phone with a face can lead to so many laughs and creative expressions, this animation is super expressive and must of been a joy to animate, you can tell there is love and amazing detail to this and it shows, so despite how ordinary the PAL Bots look, the animation goes above and beyond anything animation has done in this style, it has the right amount of cartoony style, colour, action, originality and lots of cool editing, it gives this film a unique look that I didn't think was possible but the film found a way and it's beautiful!.The characters are all delightfully weird!, I think they are all wonderful and excellent!, especially Katie and Rick, Katie is the one I can relate to the most, she's funny, witty and is very understandable from her point of view, she is a very endearing main character, Rick is also the same as well as Katie, he thinks more practically then Katie does and he does trust to get along more with his daughter and actually try to understand her, he's also really funny and so thinking outside the box, Linda's a good supporting character and a really loving mother who helps Rick when he needs help, Aaron is cute and funny as Katie's brother who loves dinosaurs, the two robots Eric (Beck Bennett) and Deborahbot 5000 (Fred Armisen) are wonderful robot characters that get a good laugh from them learning about society, the villain PAL is perhaps my favourite character in the entire film!, she is hilarious and has a wonderfully funny personality!, Mark Bowman (Eric Andr\u00e9) really isn't in the film for that long so.., he doesn't do much, although he did created PAL Labs, but yet he's not that important, hell even though the voice acting is just as awesome as the characters, Olivia Colman is delightful as PAL, she has the best performance in here, everyone else does great like Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, Abbi Jacobson, Eric Andr\u00e9, Beck Bennett and even Alex Hirsch himself in a small role, they are do a fantastic job in their roles!, the characters are just entertaining enough to be relatable and just plain hilarious, the voice acting, writing and personality really bring these characters to life!.The music is pleasant to listen to, I love Mark Mothersbaugh's score and he always does a good job, I also love the soundtrack with different choices of songs especially with one song that has Numa Numa, it's quite bizarre but very nostalgic and cool!Well I didn't expect this film to be this... AWESOME!, seriously, The Mitchells Vs. The Machines is a absolutely delightful chaotic film that has just about everything that makes animation wonderful!, with quite a engaging story with big heart, amazing humour and cool and creative action!, animation that is very stylised and pleasing for any viewer, really likeable characters that can be funny and even endearing, along with super terrific voice acting, great music and hell even a great commentary on social media, this film is tied between Spider-Verse as being the best animated Sony animated film out there, this is definitely a must watch for the entirely family, but mainly I can see teenagers and older viewers watching this as a relatable weird and nostalgic movie, this is definitely the film we needed during this difficult time, it really shows how we needed to be social outside of phones and gadgets, but it really shows how it feels to be back in normality, i want to see what Michael Rianda does next, I do hope we get more awesome films like this, I hope the next film by Sony will live up the fantasticness of this film, well I guess we'll have to wait until Wish Dragon comes out, however it'll end up, it won't beat this!This film 100% gets a 10/10.",

According to latest movie I watched, that would be a big \"NO NO\"!I am a father of two, married and drive a family station wagon. I have a full time work and late one friday eavning, I watched \"The Mitchells vs the Machines\".I was tired, and started the movie on a single tought: Nothing better to watch, this will do...I had seen the title and watched parts of the trailer. But I was not ready for what was to come.It kind of reminded me of gumball, a series my oldest kid introduced me to. This kind of wierd machup of live videos, reality mixed up with cartoons. And I think it was a good thing, because it set me up to have an open mind. Prepare for anything and everything!And that is what this movie is all about. Slapstick jokes, your daily dose of internet, wierd stuff, emotions and warm fluffy feelings. It's like an Orchestra of what I can find on Youtube. Good or bad.But whitout the fuzz of having to deal with commersials or \"reacts to\".And with an open mind, I was hooked.It's not perfect, I'll give you that as an heads up.But I think it can be something for everyone in a family. From dad, mom, grandma and kids.I laughed and cried, both at the same time.It could be this stupid punchline or that slapstick joke combined with me beeing tired. But I really enjoyed every part of it.From all mentioned above, down to the core of the story: Family, and father/daughter relationship. What do you do as a father when your kid grows up, and you loose that way of having a good connection. When she was a kid, you were best pals. You could play games, laugh, be best buds and you could be the safe place when she was sad. \"Love you dad, love you kiddo!\"\nThen she turned 15, and you went from beeing best dad to most embarassing dad.That is the core of this film, and that is what I loved most about it.

I never saw any marketing for it and hadn't heard anything about it until two of my friends from high school recommended it to me on the Movie Review Mom Facebook group and I'm so glad they did! I absolutely loved it! We now have a contender for \"Best Animation\" for next year's Academy Awards.Here's the Netflix description: A quirky, dysfunctional family's road trip is upended when they find themselves in the middle of the robot apocalypse and suddenly become humanity's unlikeliest last hope.It's so much more than just that though. There's a lot to unpack such as lessons about family, self-confidence, Furbies, Artificial Intelligence, social commentary on our dependence on our cell phones, and so much more. The family-friendly flick was written and directed by both Michael Rianda and Jeff Rowe.THINGS I LIKED:\nThis hilarious movie is so inventive and fun. The comedic beats fly fast and furiously. Every frame is entertaining and creative.Abbi Jacobson voices Katie, the protagonist teen/film student and she does a fantastic job.For some reason, people wondered if Danny McBride would do a good job as a dad. The answer: yes, yes he does!Maya Rudolph voices the mom, Linda. Her character is super relatable and sweet. As a mom, I laughed at all of the things she does that I do.The rest of the voice talent is absolutely stellar and includes Academy Award-winning Olivia Colman, Eric Andre, married power couple Chrissy Teigen & John Legend, Conan O'Brien, and SNL stars Fred Armisen, Jay Pharoah, Beck Bennet, and Sasheer Zamata.Sony Pictures Animation has clearly learned from the many mistakes made in The Emoji Movie. The influence of The Lego Movie and Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse can be seen in the style of this film.The writers and directors also created Gravity Falls, a super funny animated TV show.People have been losing their minds that MIC Drop was used in the trailer.This movie would have been so much fun to watch in a movie theater because the audience's laughter would be contagious and energetic.All of the characters are super realistic, distinctive, and entertaining. The character design is really great.The background designs and set pieces are detailed, rich, and hilarious. The onscreen effects add another layer of richness and humor that is adorable and awesome. I love the look of a 2D cartoon animation added on top of a 3D animation, much like what we saw in Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse They look like the kind of effects Katie would add if she had made the movie.Tons of funny references to and social commentary on pop culture.The pacing flies at a brisk pace, except for in a few moments when old home movies are viewed to provide the sentimental foundation between the father and daughter.Keep watching during the end credits to see pictures of the film's creators with their families. Nice touch.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\nI can understand why writer/director Michael Rianda would want to be in the movie, but his voice simply wasn't the right fit for the son, Aaron Mitchell. I suppose Michael was trying to dip into voice acting like director Brad Bird did with The Incredibles. Why didn't they get a child actor or someone who actually sounded like a little boy to voice the son? His voice was way too old sounding and it never had a comedic payoff.The resolution of the story is pretty predictable, even though there are a couple of false endings. Act 3 just keeps going and going.As soon as I saw the Furbies, I wondered what kind of product placement and merchandising deal the studio made with that company. Thankfully, none of the other pop culture items in the film seemed like blatant merchandising.TIPS FOR PARENTS:\nThis film is refreshingly wholesome and family-friendly! Yay!Family weirdness is celebrated. The entire film is family-centric and has a solid message about celebrating the unique differences and strengths in one another like in the movie The Incredibles\nIt's revealed quickly in the last scene that Katie is a lesbian.You can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",

            "content": "In \"The Mitchells vs the Machines\", Katie Mitchell (voiced by Abbi Jacobson) dreams of being a great film director (joining her icons on her version of Mount Rushmore!). She's about to travel to a west-coast film college when her dad Rick (Danny Mcbride) decides to cancel her air ticket and try to re-engage with her through one last epic road trip. Together with wife Linda (Maya Rudolph), dinosaur-mad son Aaron (director Michael Rianda) and cross-eyed pug Monchi (Doug the Pug!) they set off on their journey.But the world is set to change forever, as sentient operating system PAL (Olivia Colman) and her army of robots take over the world and prepare to launch human-kind into deep dark space. The Mitchell's, as the world's unlikeliest Avengers, appear to be the only ones available to prevent the evil plan!Positives:\nIn my review of the lamentable \"Thunder Force\", I commented that it failed my \"six laughs test\" for a comedy. I only laughed 3 times in the whole film. In contrast, this movie hammered home guffaw-generating lines and scenes about six times a minute! It's hilarious. It's one of those films (like the best Pixar ones) with so much hidden detail buried in every shot. You could watch it a dozen times and still find new hidden gags.This is a movie that is the perfect family film. A film that kids will love for the knockabout comedy and a film that adults will also fall in love with. This comes from three different angles:-- Excellent character development of the whole family. Katie feels like a fully rounded stroppy teen: she seems to be struggling with her identity (lesbian? - \"It took me a while to figure myself out\"); and she is struggling towards her personal goals despite the well-intentioned but destructive doubts that her rough-and-ready father keeps sowing. This feels like a journey that the family is on towards enlightenment, before it's too late.-- This is also a film with considerable emotional heft. It channels at times some of the best elements of the Toy Story films (most notably \"Toy Story 3\" with Andy's departure for college). (Any parents who have never experienced that joyous yet dreadful day when you drive your chicks to university or college for the first time: brace yourselves!)\n-- It's a dream for film fans. Like \"Ready Player One\", it's populated with lots of fun movie easter-eggs scattered throughout. Katie's 'Mount Rushmore' by the way has Greta Gerwig, C\u00e9line Sciamma (from \"Portrait of a Lady on Fire\"), Lynne Ramsey and Hal Ashby as her directorial inspirations.And finally, it's a film for adults appreciative of some truly great satirical one-liners, including some razor-sharp zingers at 'big tech'. For example:\"It's almost like stealing people's data and giving it to a hyper-intelligent AI as part of an unregulated tech monopoly was a bad thing\"Negatives:\nMy only minor criticism - and its a debatable one - might be the running time of 113 minutes. It might be a little too long for younger kids' attention spans. A 90 minute, more condensed, movie might have ticked the 'perfection' box.Summary Thoughts: I don't normally \"go\" for animated films much. But this one is a different breed. An instant classic. It knocks you round the chops and forces your respect by being like no animated feature you've seen before. Witty, irreverent, gloriously entertaining it's a no-brainer that this gets 5-stars from me.I said in my review of \"Nomadland\" that although that wasn't a 5* film for me, I could see why its brave and different slant at film-making earned it the Best Film Oscar. Well, almost regardless of what epically beautiful production Pixar might bring out before the end of the year, if the Academy doesn't vote this Best Animated Feature at next year's Oscars, then some sort of crime might have been committed.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

I don't give a damn for memes, gifs, or terrible music remixed by Rihanna making it equally terrible. All that being said, it hits its target audience perfectly! Gen Z will fall in love with it's hyper active antics, over the top voice talents, and action packed (albeit terribly cliched) storyline. It's not very original from either a sci fi adventure or coming of age perspective. The going away to college/family tension story arc was predictable. I don't understand why it's always gotta be the dad who doesn't \"get\" or support his kid, where are all the awesome dads in these films? Also, I really wish that story tellers would endeavor to teach our future generations that education isn't everything and you won't always get the job that you go to school for. I realize most will scoff at it, but the dad encouraging his daughter to have a back up plan should've been more than just his disbelief in what she does. This should've been discussed further as a family unit, to demonstrate the realities of post secondary education and life itself. It wouldn't have hurt for both parents to say, \"yeah, you like to make movies, and we hope you're successful at it, but if it doesn't pan out *we're* here for you.\" Instead kids will think parents just plain don't \"believe in them\" when they say they want to grow up to be professional TikTok influencers... It's clear the filmmakers just wanted to make a fun, cutesy, geeky movie for Gen Z, but I wish they had given more depth and a stronger message behind all the fun.",

Danny McBride voices her technophobic dad who strives to get his children more in touch with nature and wildlife.What ensues is a delightful romp full of laugh out loud moments, life lessons and several questions posed to the audience on where do we draw the line between using technology to better our standard of living vis-\u00e0-vis losing touch with those most close to us.Maya Rudolph, Olivia Colman and Mike Riando voice the other supporting characters with elan and the quirky, edgy animation is an absolute masterclass.The music from Mark Mothersbaugh is uplifting and energetic and excellently gels with the narration, and you are sure to be humming the theme well after watching the film.For the whole family this one!

An up-to-date warning about the dangers of computer fascism.Review:Katie lives with her parents and her younger brother. She gets accepted to a film school, but her father cancels her plane flight and decides to take her to school by car with the whole family. In the middle of the journey they are surprised by a world rebellion of robots commanded by an unthinkable leader (voiced by Olivia Colman).Few doubt that, for some years now, the best scripts and the most creative ideas have been largely provided by animated films. And as in this case, they also endow their characters with a complexity and humanity often absent from their flesh and blood counterparts.In this film, the family dynamics in the face of the crisis that it must face is very well developed: its members learn to know and respect each other and to redefine their roles. There is a vindication of the family that does not look conservative but rather as a collective and overcoming reconstruction and not as compliance with the previous status quo.But undoubtedly, the strength of this Michael Rianda and Jeff Rowe film is the mind-blowing, creative and adrenaline-pumping narrative roller coaster about this family (not forgetting their dog, the protagonist of a recurring hilarious conceptual gag) that is forced to face this rebellion. World of robots and other machines in the very heart of Silicon Valley, sporting a huge visual display (combining various animation effects), unbeatable humorous timing and ironic criticism of young computer geniuses and the bidding software vs. Hardware and connectivity, virtual assistants and online life as a panacea.

I recommend that you see it in installments of 20 minutes or so or maybe less if your head starts spinning earlier. It's like sitting through a \" Tom and Jerry \" cartoon for nearly 2 hours. I have nothing against animation movies. In fact I have recently seen \" Encanto\" and \" Raya and the last dragon \" both well made, lovely, interesting movies focussed on peace, togetherness and family values. This movie tries to project family values but the focus is on the fast and furious battle between an American family and robots as each group attempts to establish supremacy. Mr Mitchell, mom Linda, teenaged daughter Katie, her little brother Aaron and the doggie are all hyper and desperate all the time. The humans behave like robots and the robots are trying to become humans. Even this premise is okay but the loud, wild and garish way the director has gone about presenting the plot keeps you disturbed rather than entertained. There are intermittent attempts at projecting humor but each time it falls flat. A simpler plot without the excessive action would have worked really well. The opening scenes of the lady in the Columbia logo shaking up gives you an idea of what will follow and it surely happens. Scene after scene of deafening soundtrack, mayhem and destruction follow in quick succession which would please kids of age group 6-10 years or young adults of similar IQ. Sample what Mr Mitchell says \" The Mitchell's are weird and that's what makes us great. So let's go and save the world \". Even Arnold Schwarzenegger didn't have to do so much to save the world.

During this time, they have to bond together more than ever when a robot apocalypse threatens to exterminate humanity!From the very beginning to the end, it's a massive warm hug of a movie that is profoundly relatable with a genuinely investing family unit at the heart of the story. You're there with them through every heartfelt moment; the storytelling is so perfect that you instantly feel at home with these characters from the start. The humour is just... chef's kiss is all I can say! Monchi is an incredible animated creation!The animation is quite unlike anything I've seen before; it's beautifully unique and really eye popping! Written and directed by Michael Rianda and Jeff Rowe, it's a story told with bursting passion for cinema and a labour of family love from each crew member (the end credits are so sweet!)",

Even when the film has a great sense of humour, excellent animation and it's always fun, it falls into a very predictable and conservative plot; with the classical American defence of the family and the expected roles and arches of all the members of it.

            "content": "The Mitchell's Vs The Machines is a 2021 family animated film from Sony Animations. They made Spider-Man Into The Spiderverse back in 2018 which won best animated picture. They then partnered with the same people who made The Lego Movie to make this picture. It was supposed to come out a while ago as did most and it was supposed to be named Connected. That is just an interesting bit of information.The Mitchell's Vs The Machines is about a family who is growing farther apart by the improvements of technology. In fact, they families oldest child, Katie (Abbi Johnson) is heading off to college. The family decided to go on one last family road trip. At the same time, the leading tech company is releasing a robot that does everything for you. The machines then override the programing and begin to take humans captive. The Mitchell's then become the only family left and they must work together to save the world.This film was somewhat of a pleasant surprise. I didn't think it was going to be all that good. I was happy to find out it was just a blast. It was actually funny! That is hard to find while watching a family movie now. Most movies seem to think bodily functions will always make you laugh no matter what. It is incredibly annoying. This film did have some of that towards the start but for the most part it sort of poked fun at some family experiences. Sort of like what The Great Outdoors did but for families with younger kids to watch. There were a bunch of scenes that got some good laughs out of me, not chuckles! The story was also fairly creative. It did in the end come to where you thought it would go but the way it started was pretty different.The voice acting was nothing out of the ordinary everybody did a pretty good job. They had some SNL guys like Beck Bennet and Fred Armison voicing some robots. Also Olivia Coleman from The Crown also had a voice acting credit. The dog in the movie was voiced by Dug The Pug. I didn't even know they gave dogs voice acting credits. It was a pretty big cast of voice actors so it would have been pretty hard for the voice acting to be anything below good.The animation style was a little different from your typical computer generated animation. They blended in some real images along with some classic animation. Some times the classic animation would make the film look a little weird just because of the stuff they did with it but for the most part it was pretty cool.The Mitchell's Vs The Machines was a fun family film with plenty of good laughs and a somewhat new story. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to sit down and watch a funny film.",

If anything movies like these make kids feel like they should be ashamed for being different. The parents just gave up on their kids only to require the end of the world to find the motivation to reconnect with their kids.The most annoying part is the stupid dog.

Although the film can be a bit hyper and cheesy at times, it has a brightly animated, comic book look, is cleverly written, and well acted, with some good old nostalgia thrown in, as well as some moral messages about how tech can interfere with relationships, the importance of family (even a dysfunctional one), and seeing things from another person's perspective.

            "content": "If you liked:\nGravity Falls\nLadybird\nLife is Strange (videogame)Finally, a quality animation. Not only it is brought to you by Sony Animations, the studio that made the Oscar-winning \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" 3 years ago (their first project after the Oscar); it was also directed by the creative director of the first season of \"Gravity Falls\" and written by the writer of it's second season. The sole creator of the \"Gravity Falls\" show Alex Hirsch worked as a story consultant on this film, and you can really feel the Gravity Falls influence in the signature pacing and crazy humor of \"Mitchells\".Like all greatest animations, \"The Mitchells and the Machines\" is a very childish yet a very adult film. The Mitchells, possibly the weirdest family in the world, finds themselves in a position where they are humanity's only hope in overcoming a sentient robot apocalypse. You know, the usual. The main theme of the movie though isn't so much the robots, but the relationships the family has - to each other as well as to the outside world. We have a teenager girl who feels insecure and isolated because of her unusual interests, the age-old problem of finding your tribe. We have a dysfunction father-daughter relationship where both can't seem to understand each other and find a way to talk about it. We have a mother that tries her hardest to give her family the very best in all possible areas of life but finds herself comparing the behind the scenes of her family's life with the highlight's reel of the lives of others. We have a little brother who, apart from loving dinosaurs, is afraid to express his feelings of any kind to anyone in fear of rejection and misunderstanding, not even being able to tell his sister how agonizingly much he will miss her once she leaves home. And we have a dumb and useless but absolutely lovable pug who is the soul of the whole film. All these character traits are very subtly and gradually exposed in the movie, while keeping the crazy, video-game-like, colorful mask to keep the youngest members of the audience entertained. Every character is relatable, you can see the quirks and behavior of each one in your own family members and I really admire how well they were able to frame these kinds of problems and stories that practically any family in the world has.This film is the definition of a family film, you are supposed to sit down and enjoy it with your whole family, although you must be careful - at least one is bound to cry by the end of it.

            "content": "What we all need is some good, old-fashioned escapist fare! Right?!? What could be better than a nice, family-friend animated movie? How about an animated action-comedy about the robot apocalypse - Robocalypse? Enter Netflix with The Mitchells vs. The Machines. Is this just watch the therapist ordered? Here goes...The Mitchells vs. The Machines is an animated action-comedy about a typical middle-American family that embarks on a road trip to take the oldest child, Katie Mitchell, to film school in California. As it so happens, the robot apocalypse arrives in the middle of their trip. Here, Katie Mitchell is an aspiring filmmaker, always behind her camera and struggling to find her community through her artistic expression. Rick Mitchell, the father, doesn't understand Katie or anything about technology, really. The brewing tension between father and daughter bubbles over as Katie desperately wants to escape home and find her place at film school. In a bid to recapture their old bond, Rick packs up the family and plans to drive Katie to school across country as last minute family outing. As most cross-country family adventures go, the Mitchells are suffering through disappointing roadside attractions and general claustrophobia until the machines come and force the family to work together to save the world. It all happens in the way only an animated movie can do.There's a lot to recommend in this movie. First, the visual style is amazing. There is a lot of kinetic energy to the animation. You won't know where to look and the detail is inspiring. It is clever how there seems to be a mixed-media quality to the animation. It could get overwhelming at times, but it is never boring. Moreover, all of the various visual styles complement the story. Second, the writing hit the marks you would want from an action-adventure-comedy animated movie. There are sight gags that reference technology and social media. Fred Armisen and Beck Bennett play dim-witted robots, who team up with the Mitchells, and they add to the humor. Olivia Colman give a great voice-performance as the A. I. villain, who set the robot apocalypse in motion. She has the wit and mischievousness that these animated villains need. While there are some apocalypse tropes that pop up throughout, there is a lot more that feels fresh that what could be cliched does not completely derail the good time.My biggest gripe about The Mitchells vs. The Machines is that it takes a long time to get to the \"vs. The Machines\" part of the movie. There is a lot of set up. Obviously, the goal of the set up is so that the audience invests in the success of the family, particularly the rekindling of the father-daughter relationship; but, I felt that it took too long. Further, once the movie does get to the \"vs. The Machines\" part, while it is satisfying and entertaining, it also becomes too much of a good thing. At an hour and 49 minutes, the movie is too long and could have hit all of the action-comedy marks, including the emotional climax, if some extraneous things had been cut.Netflix certainly delivered with this one. The Mitchells vs. The Machines is a great family film that has nice themes about both individuality and family togetherness. There is humor and heart throughout. The action is entertaining and the animation is visually intriguing. Gather the family with a big box of popcorn and enjoy the Robocalypse.",

(I've now 100% stopped watching trailers) I'm really glad I gave it a watch though because it's a lot better than you might think.The characters are all great. Each family member, including the adorable robots, gets a lot of fun stuff to do, and none of them felt annoying. Sometimes in this kind of movie the 'misunderstood teen' character or the 'stuck in his ways father' can be really irritating and over the top, but here they felt a lot less stereotypical.The writing and humour was also great. There were enough references and jokes for the younger audience, but it wasn't too alienating for other ages either, as there was plenty of lines from the perspective of the older characters. I found that I was genuinely laughing at almost every joke, with a few huge standouts. (Everything involving the pug!)The story and message itself also pleasantly surprised me. Often the 'modern society' or 'technology bad' leans way too hard on one side of the argument and it can be painfully unsubtle, especially in kids films that feel the need to spell things out too much. In this movie though, we see both sides fairly and reasonably make their point, and it feels like the film is able to show positives about different perspectives, which is refreshing.Lastly, the animation is absolutely stunning. Beautiful colours and energetic action scenes that keep your eyes very happy.Overall this was great fun, with enjoyable characters and a lot of sweet and emotional moments too. It was much better than the trailers, and I'd give it a 9/10!",

But alas being a family friendly movie, all is sorted while fighting for the survival of the world.It's super fun to watch and I hope there is a sequel to follow.VERDICT:\nHighly recommended family viewing.

A film about a dysfunctional family going on a road trip doesn't sound all the unique but this film also includes robots taking over the world, its almost like a mix between the Incredibles and the Terminator and man its amazing. I absolutely loved the quirky and vibrant animation style it was really refreshing to see something so different from what a usual animated film looks like. The family storyline hit me right in the feels, I loved the relationship between Katie and her dad, and it was extremely satisfying seeing them reconnect again throughout the film. The film is hilarious I laughed out loud so many times and there where only a few jokes that didn't land for me. The picture perfect neighbours voiced by Chrissy Teagan and John Legend where easily among the best part of the film for me and I loved the two robots who befriend the family as well. The voice cast is terrific, Abbi Jacobson does a great job at voicing teenager Katie but Danny McBride was the stand out of me he gave such a believable and hilarious performance as dad Rick and I hope he does more similar roles in the future. The villain voiced brilliantly by Olivia Colman is on the forgettable side and feels like a very typical villain character but I did understand her motivations and she was quite funny and entertaining at times. The third act goes on a bit to long for my liking but I still really enjoyed it and it was wonderful seeing the family work together to take down the Robots. As much as I laughed watching this film I was also crying several times throughout it, the home videos of Katie and her Dad where tear jerking moments and the ending where Katie goes off to film school and the family share a beautiful goodbye left me with tears streaming down my face. I honestly think this is a film the whole family can enjoy, there is something here for everyone and the Mitchells vs the Machines is without a doubt one of the best films of the year so far.",

            "content": "America's dwindling attention spans are not lost on our esteemed creative industry. As social media and the omnipresent smartphone chip away at what little grey matter we've retained over the last decade, Hollywood is catering to our predicament by making films that are faster, uber saturated, and yes, dumber. They're in your face and out the door before you have time to greet them, and the Mitchells vs. The Machines is made in this frenetic mold, despite a plea to put down the tech and look each other in the eye. It's a film that doesn't live up to its own message.The film follows a family of four (plus a pug) as they save the world from a robot apocalypse, brought about by a dime store Jeff Bezos and a scorn A. I. smartphone. Splitting time plot-wise is the story of the family themselves, anchored by daughter Katie and patriarch Rick; she's leaving the nest and he's anxious about her burgeoning adulthood.As a kid-friendly actioner, the film is brisk and lively, with bursts of color and kinetic action. As a family drama it's repetitive and tedious at times, indulging in the grief of losing a kid to the big wide world. The voice cast is capable and grounded, if unspectacular, though they're purposely overshadowed by the pace and excessive quirk of the film, which is set to ludicrous speed from the word go.One of the most grating and repetitive elements is the idea of the Mitchells being a dysfunctional, hopelessly flawed family. This idea would spark emotional investment if there were any noticeable flaws in our main family, but there simply aren't; all four are generally hard working, tenacious, can-do, enormously kind, and almost entirely understanding.The film's emotional core is fixated on the almost while downplaying the Mitchell's positive traits, which are ample. The message of embracing flaws rings rather hollow when one of the flaws most repeatedly mentioned is...a young boy liking dinosaurs? The disconnect between the theme and execution is sometimes baffling.Overall, The Mitchells vs. The Machines is an above-average kids' film, which many adults will be able to invest themselves in. It doesn't live up to Kung Fu Panda's wonderfully choreographed action and lush cinematography or its Toy Story 3 theme, but it's an original and thematically relevant outing. Despite its hypocrisy and please-please-please-like-me quirkiness, it's a good time at home with the kids.",

This film not only LOOKS AMAZING, it is also so much more HILARIOUS than I expected, the story is straightforward and sticks to it really well.In film, it's incredibly hard to make heartfelt and comedic work equally well and have neither ruin the other. Both aspects in this movie compliment each other spectacularly.I saw the trailer and was afraid because a lot of what I took in could've gone SO wrong. I then looked up who the people behind the movie and my expectations went higher.Despite there being clich\u00e9 relationship tropes, each character is just so well voiced and charismatic. They are all done excellently. I can relate a lot to relationship issues and seeing them fixed just fills my heart with joy.The thing that I love about this film is that it takes so many clich\u00e9s and uses them to their absolute best. Proving that good movies can still be made even if there are more modern jokes and popular characteristics.Overall a movie that exceeded my expectations VERY highly. The perfect, splendid blend of Heartfelt and Comedy. I recommend this film to all and give as much love and support to you genius, hard working folks behind this film!

            "content": "This movie definitely has its fun and funny moments, but where it falls short for me is it's attempt to try and deliver a life lesson while simultaneously being completely out of the realm of possibility. It tries to show how a dysfunctional family comes together through hardship and in the end, finally understand one another. The dysfunction is comically on the nose and there is no subtlety to what they are trying to portray. If you're an adult, this probably won't resonate with you because of how blatantly obvious the themes are. If you are a child, this sets a completely unrealistic expectation for how the world works. Family dynamics aren't this blatantly obvious and easy to fix, and you're never going to go on some life altering adventure with the people in your life. The characters talk about how it's important to take chances and not play it safe, but they fail to mention that they have indestructible plot armor. There are countless times that these characters should have died, but made it out without a scratch. Life isn't just one comically happy ending where everything works out fine. More often than not, life is brutal. I understand that this is a cartoon and not meant to be taken seriously, but that's not how kids operate. Kids absorb this and as a result develop a delusional idea of how the world is a good place where nothing bad will happen. There are absolutely no consequences for the actions the characters take in this movie.So if you're looking for some mindless cartoon entertainment for the night, sure, give this a go, but please don't try to take anything meaningful away from this and I'd advise against showing this to kids.",

You have all this tension within the family, none of it is over dramatic or anything it all feels real and makes them feel like a real family. It has a wonderful script, wonderfully directed and watching it put a huge smile on my face.The Bad- I can't watch it for the first time again\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02, I actually can't think of any big issues with this film it is awesome in every way.Overall I'm going to give The Mitchell's Vs The Machines a 9/10.

            "content": "I feel like this is the first animated movie I can genuinely say was made by millennials/genx towards the \"zoomer\" (or smartphone) generation and you can definitely see the effects both mostly good and sometimes bad.For me in the GenX generation, the action sequences were truly amazing but often hard to comprehend with comic books scribbles everywhere, giant colorful complex paintings randomly shoved in your face, robots flying all over the screen, and so many screams, internet memes and loud noises it was sometimes sensory overload. In a way I didn't like how the movie was 11/10 intensity the entire time. I felt tired during the one hour mark and decided to take a break to make popcorn and then I had fun again.The visual style of The Mitchell's & The Machines was entertaining though and the kind of fresh experimentation that Hollywood is sorely missing.I empathized with the daughter character, she was so passionate about going to Film School, while I never did go myself, I dreamed of doing it and her feelings were very close to mine at that age, really well written character. While this family is considered \"dysfunctional\" I thought they could have been a lot worse of people, they at least were always there for each other. The mother was hilarious! So overall I liked the characters.Our villains were pretty solid, they provided a good challenge and were a fun parody of current tech industry trends. Interestingly, the message of the film here was similar to Joker's \"stop treating each other like disposable trash\".Why I have given a 8/10, there were two plot holes, the father was unbelievably computer illiterate, also the art college looked really bad, nothing like Los Angeles and more like Boston that's just a nitpick.That said, I still recommend The Mitchells vs. The Machines!

When I finally watched it, I definitely saw why. This film comes from the minds behind some of my favorite things, including Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, The Lego Movie, and Gravity Falls! The animation is definitely top-notch, and I love how it blends CGI with live-action stock footage and photos, puppetry, and hand-drawn animation! I also really love the concept of putting a dysfunctional family against a robot apocalypse. The only thing I could do without was the casting of Chrissy Teigen as the snooty perfect next-door neighbor. She can't really voice act her way through a paper bag. So, Ms. Teigen, don't quit your day job. (Wait, what even IS your day job other than being Mrs. John Legend?) Anyhoo, I feel sorry for the other animated films coming out this year.

And I do think that it's an overall strong movie with a strong enough cast\n, and a fantastically written script with a lot of wit and charm that it feels like an overall productive movie.But...man, the pandemic must've done some work to this movie because the pacing and especially the editing feels all over the place. It feels like some scenes move at breakneck paces while others are too slow, the villain never really seems to be bothered (minus one comedic scene) by the events, and their counter response to the family's actions is written off as a joke, essentially. Plus it feels like the dad and the daughter quite literally go through the same discussion four times in this movie. Does that make sense thematically, sure, but it makes for a movie that feels like it doesn't exactly know what hoop it's shooting for. And there are way, WAY too many jokes with the dog.I think it's a fun enough watch, but I don't think I'll really be playing this over and over again like some other recent animated films.",

The story for the father daughter was very touchy and moving especially since I'm a father of a young baby girl. The movie was very funny and we laughed at many parts and it also went by very fast. In end when it said it was based on true story then I got it because the movie had a unique vision, humor and heart which is missing from many films.

            "content": "This idea will shock some people: The internet is not inside of your phone. Without a worldwide, energy hungry infrastructure it's not so smart after all. The big bad in \"The Mitchells ...\" is a really big brained AI living in a normal smartphone. It controls a gigantic army of humanoid flying robots with futuristic weapons in their arms. Why? Because those robots looks great and most people can relate to a smartphone. That's why.They don't even care to use some lazy explaination like: It's a smartphone from a parallel universe, where it did build all those robots, vehicles and buildings it uses to capture and subjugate 7 billion people. This is a movie from the metaverse, where everything that looks vaguely familiar, because similar things had been shown on some screen before, will be accepted.It's not only the basic premise of \"The Mitchells ...\" that's insane. This is just another product of a brainless industry with great technicians and machines that produces shiny, colorful, fast moving entertainement for people who can shut down their brain while watching this.Just one other of the many things wrong with \"The Mitchells ...\": The daughter uses the family dog to make trashy Youtube videos, like quite a few 12 year old boys do. She shows a short, cruel, edgy clip in her class and the boys just look completely shocked. What are they? Some kind of freaks? This scene is supposed to demonstrate how much of an outsider she is. Her brother is a freak, because he is into dinosaurs, the (of course very, very goofy) father, because he is into nature. This would be very ordinary \"freaks\", if they were not so completely obsessed with the one thing that defines them. They are very one-dimensional characters, shrill, boring and charmless caricatures.Tron (1982) was an electric fairy tale about people living in a computer, silly, but imaginative, groundbreaking and with an unique charme.\"The Mitchells ...\" is a silly tale about an AI person living in a smartphone, an irrelevant rehash of better movies, probably partially compiled by some stupid AI, but thanks to the vast number of ideas thrown at the audience it is still mildly entertaining.",

Mitchells Family may not be the perfect family, where there are differences between parents and offspring; but we see how they overcome their differences and connect.Even if it has the most generic storyline, you are emerged into all the emotions of each and every character, because they are so well established from the very beginning.Surely a blissful watch.",

It talked about some pretty serious themes and was really heartfelt and emotional. The voice actors were all very good and fitted the characters perfectly. I also want to point out that this is how you write a LGBTQIA+ character. The main character's sexuality was never shoved into the spot light for no reason and it felt so nice for a gay character to simply exist instead of struggling with their sexuality. Funny, heartfelt and memorable. I wish I'd watched this movie a lot sooner.",

It's gorgeous. I can see Sony played with some of the ideas from Into The Spiderverse, but this animation plays a surprisingly significant roll in the film. The main character, Katie, is one quirky teenager, and the animation really fits in with her personality, which is nice because the movie is narrated by her.Animation: 9/10 - freaking gorgeous.The storyThe story isn't really unique, as I'm sure we've all seen the \"rebellious/misunderstood teen and the very bad at communication/I have never used a computer before type of dad, but it handles these themes really well. The story was kind of slow, bumpy and uneven near the start, but at the end I applauded for as long as I could. The payoff is amazing, though it might just a tiny bit have stretched on for too long.The story: 7/10 - pretty darn good, also quite emotional I may add.The humorThe humor. I will not say anymore about it. It's so good it bumped this review up by one star. Just go watch it for a good time.Humor: 10/10 - missed a few times but DAMN it's funny.Character developmentI love the characters. They have their own personality, but aren't entirely two dimensional and each have their own moment. I loved to see the interaction between Katie and her father, and I absolutely love it when the emotional parts hit.Character development: 8/10 - fleshed out charactersBefore I go, I want to say, this movie does so well tying up loose ends and emotional parts. Without spoiling, parts at the beginning show up near the end as well, and it is a very nice surprise.Overall, an amazing family movie, movie or anything really. It basically gets everything right.9/10.",

I'm probably not the first to point out that the finger-wagging at Big Tech is a bit rich in the context of a feature-length CGI film, but ok, fine, maybe we're over-analyzing it. There are quite a few very satisfying moments in the script, nice animation, and good voice work. There's some sharply observed stuff about families, although I must say that animated features getting all angsty about familial relationships is not exactly fresh or innovative at this point, and \"Iron Giant\" and \"The Incredibles\" and \"Coco\" and all did it better. But it was fun, and well worth watching.By the way, is it, like, illegal or something to make a movie without Olivia Colman in it? Don't get me wrong, I think she's a magnificently talented actor; I've been a fan since all the way back to \"Peep Show.\" Good for her for making it to the top, but it's becoming kind of amusing that she seems to be in EVERYTHING these days.",

The movie that pushed the boundaries of 3d?So i was only sure of one thing, even if the story was garbage, even if the pacing dragged the whole thing off, I was sure the visuals would rock, and it didLet's talk about visuals, i'm going to be brief here, the visual style blew me away, it's nothing like i've seen before, it's on-par with Spiderverse.Let's talk the story for a moment, remember when everyone said the premise of the movie was conflicted?Going for a family trip story, plug off your phones, spend time with your family, reject technology or something along the lines.But then everyone was surprised by the robots invasion, technology going against us! It turned into an action movie, with a kinda apocalyptic theme.Now.. let's ask the question: can these two themes coexist, and create a compelling story? Yes it can!The story jusy needs to go for their family story beats, and also the action story beats.But the highlight of the story would be the characters, the characters were an interesting bit, they had some interesting dynamics, with the most developed being the father and daughter, which were kinda tied with the family vs technology theme , which was their source of conflict.The movie started because of their conflict, the daughter, representing the tech side, with an obsession for film, got accepted on film school and was soon going to move out.The father, representing the family side was not happy with that, so he decided to go onto the last family trip togetherA nice little touch was the other 2 characters, mom and the little brothers being the bridge to their characters' resolution.I really liked the characters, and the change they've been gone through, a big plus for me.At the end of the day, the movies visuals were groundbreaking, and the story was good. With its message not being \"reject technology\" or \"live in the woods\" but its more like \"technology and family can coexist, and they can even help each other\"",

When I first saw this in my Netflix feed, I thought nothing of it. I never heard about the movie before I saw it. No news of it and I never even saw any reviews of it. I immediately thought it was something like Wonderpark or the Emoji Movie or Ugly Dolls. I immediately passed it off until someone on here praised it. I looked it up on IMDB and RT and it had great reviews. I just finished and after writing this, I am immediately gonna rewatch it.I connected with this movie. It parallels my life so much right now. Katie, a film loving teenage girl who struggles to connect with her dad is excited to go to University soon to be with people who are exactly like her. She has a little brother who is hilarious and a mum who is embarrassing yet caring and loving. Not to mention the dumb dog.Change her to male and we're the same character, thats basically my life right now. I have a hilarious little brother who is a great friend. A dumb dog who I love to bits. Two caring parents who sometimes, I struggle to connect with. A character who is going to university to study their passion. I'm off to Uni in September. Not to study film but it almost was what I was taking actually. I just connected with this so much and there were moments where I got teary eyes.This movie is hilarious. Every joke lands and none of them feel forced. They feel organic and they fit the overall tone and aesthetic of the movie. The gags in the background fit the movie so well and I always had a smile on my face watching it.The animation, dear god the animation was gorgeous. Its battling with a Silent Voice right now for best looking animation right now and I think it might win. The lighting, the settings, the character design, everything about how it looked was incredible.Another thing about the jokes is that I think it really handled Internet jokes and Gen Z jokes so so so well. In movies like Ralph Breaks the Internet or the Emoji Movie failed to this because they focused on using the Internet and memes as the concept of the story and it feels forced. With this movie, it felt organic and funny because it wasn't the focus. The focus was on the family which was right.The story is fun, the robots were great, the villain was fun, not to be taken seriously but a good villain I think.I am giving this movie a A+, 10/10, 5 Stars, whatever.

            "review_title": "\"The Mitchells vs. The Machines\" - Using Art to Save the World Maria Elena Gutierrez\"The Mitchells vs. The Machines\" - Using Art to Save the World by Maria Elena Gutierrez",
            "content": "The Mitchells vs. The Machines sends a dysfunctional family on a road trip across the United States, then almost immediately plunges them into a cataclysmic robot uprising. Bursting with comedic energy, the film plays with mixed media and a sketchy animation style, artfully subverting expectations about what an animated feature should look like.Expectations are further upended by the storyline. In the current round of mainstream Hollywood movies, we are bombarded by stories about \"perfect\" superheroes. Such films present their creators with a difficult challenge: how to make their superpowered characters relatable to an audience of ordinary people who will never in their lives be able to leap over tall buildings or fly faster than a bullet.With The Mitchells vs. The Machines, however, writer-directors Mike Rianda and Jeff Rowe have channelled a different kind of superpower: their own understanding that, in the real world, misfits are far more commonplace than superheroes. Celebrating \"weirdos,\" Rianda and Rowe have chosen as their protagonists a group of ordinary people. The heroism of Katie Mitchell and her quirky family lies in the everyday dimension. It is their very imperfection that makes them relatable, and we as an audience find their flaws endearing because ultimately we all feel that we ourselves are flawed.Of course, the very goofiness of the Mitchell family also provides an endless source of entertainment - rightly so, since this is, after all, a family comedy. The filmmakers exploit the humor of bathos and hyperbole, permitting their characters to note with dry comic timing that, while some families are grappling with organising their family photo albums, or dealing with picky eaters, the Mitchells have to manage a robot apocalypse. Pop culture references abound, from youth-friendly commentary on the politics of social media, to evocations of classic movies that are sure to please the more mature crowd -\nIn Pal's geometric core there are echo's of Stanley Kubrick's monolith from from 2001: A Space Odyssey.Hidden beneath this sense of fun is a simple but profound message of reassurance: that it is okay to be odd. This idea is supported by the circular nature of the Mitchell family's strange odyssey, which begins with the suggestion that their weirdness is something that sets them apart. At the end of the film, however, as we listen to young Katie Mitchell's speech about why humanity should be saved, we see how this family of misfits has transformed itself into something special and magical. This shows us that the magic exist in our every day lives. We just have to look at it through the right lens. \"Weirdness,\" it seems,\nis what makes us unique.Turning our attention to the Mitchells' neighbours - an image-obsessed superhero family call the Poseys - we might even detect echoes of an everyday cultural struggle in which working class people live in passive envy of their apparently perfect upper class counterparts. Social media addicts derive pleasure from both watching and being watched, and so the relationship between 'weird' mother Linda Mitchell and her 'perfect' counterpart Hailey Posey can be read as a model of mimetic desire. The relationship endures to the end - when Hailey finally demonstrates her new-found acceptance of Linda by allowing the Mitchell mother to follow her on Instagram, the irony of this gracious gesture is all too apparent.This particular dynamic delivers its own share of entertainment to an audience that knows what it is to be the underdog. Watching the film, we experience a certain sado-masochistic pleasure not only in seeing the Mitchells triumph over their adversaries, but also in sharing the various torments they endure themselves.Yet The Mitchells vs. The Machines also presents us with another juxtaposition: that of a natural world built on love and human values, in contrast to the technological realm of Silicon Valley and social media, where people are caught up in endless images of themselves, not who they really are.In their own different ways, therefore, the individual members of the Mitchell family are battling not only to defeat the robots, but also to find their true selves. One such route to self-discovery lies in the space of memory - presented in vibrant form throughout the film. By immersing ourselves in the past, we discover a state of being that is more genuine than the cultural state in which we find ourselves today, and within which we can ultimately achieve enlightenment.The Pater familias (father of the family), Rick Mitchell, seeks such knowledge through his love of nature. A modern-day Luddite, he advises his movie-obsessed daughter, Katie, to look at the world not through her camera lens but with her own eyes, which he describes as 'nature's camera.' And so Rick's world view aligns closely with the film's assertion that technology in the wrong hands can be lethal. At the same time, it portrays the tension between father and daughter. Fearful as he is, Rick wants only to protect Katie - part of his journey is learning that the best way to do this is to let her go.Through all this, it is Katie's philosophy that ultimately prevails. From her position at the heart of the story, this young girl instantly presents herself as a storyteller, as she attempts to escape reality through the medium of cinema. Katie's youthful enthusiasm for zany imagery and crazy ideas is mirrored in the dynamic visual style of The Mitchells vs The Machines. Is she in fact the alter ego of the film's directors? It is hard to argue against the idea.Katie's agency in the story is further reinforced by her status as an openly gay character. With seemingly effortless ease, The Mitchells vs The Machines succeeds in broadcasting and celebrating her sexuality - often through simple visual devices such as the rainbow button she wears - while at the same time never drawing undue attention to it. It is rare for the LGBQT community to be represented so naturally in a Hollywood film - especially an animated feature - and this subtle balancing act is to be applauded.As the robots threaten to overwhelm the planet, it is Katie's passion for art - and her father's eventual recognition of arts value - that saves the day. From the beginning, the film demonstrates that Katie's way of knowing herself and understanding reality is through her art - which she perceives as an expression of her weirdness. And so, it is Katie who teaches us the lesson that lies at the heart of The Mitchells vs The Machines: that art will not only save us in the end, but it will heal us, too.Dr. Maria Elena Gutierrez is the CEO and executive director of VIEW Conference, Italy's premiere annual digital media conference.

And it's not that I don't appreciate that stuff done well, it was like it was every other scene... so much of the movie was devoted to the family drama aspect that the overall plot and the stakes of it felt a bit hollow. There are ways to do both effectively, like The Incredibles. But this just came off as preachy, overly wordy, and very direct.But overall it was a fine movie, the animation was great, it was actually really witty with some kinda wild adult humor at times (cthulhu furby?

The positive points of this work are several, ranging from technical quality to characters. Technically speaking it is beautiful, the film has a comedy tone and a very youthful and cool animation style that works, a montage that favors comedy and drama, although it has some jokes that didn't work very well with me, and the drama part it works very well, knowing when to take it seriously or not, when the film becomes a self-parody yields very good jokes,\nAlthough I don't think I am the right person to analyze the voice works since I can only differentiate if it is very bad or very good, so I will not be able to go as deep as I would like. That said, I liked the characters more, all of that family I can relate to in some way, Katie's love of cinema, Aaron's passion for dinosaurs, Rick's affection for nature, Linda's unconditional love for her children and the extreme cuteness of Pug Monchi. The villain is a very cool thing in this, first: she is voiced by Olivia Colman, second: she has a valid motivation, abandonment, which is something that is very explored in the film within the Mitchell family.Only two things bothered me about the film, the '' violence '' and some plotters. I left the word violence in quotes because the situations that the family goes through would be impossible not to get hurt in any way, and since the rating is G, the filmmakers could not put very strong scenes.Although the script is good, sometimes there is the feeling that something in the middle doesn't make much narrative sense, like the shopping scene, the villain could have sent her entire army of robots to pick up the family, but she preferred appliances to going after them, even though she has the underestimated could send a little better warpower. There are still other script inconsistencies that I would like to comment on but then I would have to enter the spoilers zone.In resume: The Mitchells vs. The Machines is a light family comedy to watch on that tiring end of the day and maybe get a little emotional.Note: 7,7 / 10,0.",

This is one of the funniest animated films I have ever seen. My wife and I kept having to rear wind it and watch scenes again they were so funny. The humor here should be universal because it's not basic humor it's like humor from a seasoned pro comedian Who just has a gift and everyone laughs. The comedy has perfect timing and placement speed everything. This movie is a well-willed machine of laughs and truly lets you empathize with the characters and what they represent and is certainly relatable and overarm major arching themes. As you get close to the characters it's a little bit of an emotional roller coaster and is completely within the purview of real life which may be is what makes it so touching and why it resonates with me and our ideas of family. This movie just hits the spot and every way possible the sound and animation are impeccable and they CGI combined with the drawn on screen type graphic, works amazingly well. As does their stop and start timing of sound and music and resignation and fruition of small comedic and emotional seeds that bloom into bigger ideas. This is creative art done perfectly well that it just makes you laugh out loud and empathize and relate with the characters if they send multiple good messages. I cannot give this phone high enough praise. In terms of recent film which has been lacking a little bit of depth like this does and I'm not just talking about plot death I'm talking more about the subtext of the plot even if it is simple. This is a joy ride where the hits just keep on coming and coming. What I mean about the complexity is this film is that the combination of elements required to make such a great film at so many levels is what makes it so fantastic. Not that it has a deeply complex plot or anything like that but that the sound the animation the writing the direction the production the timing the concept the art department everything just comes together perfectly and Sony fires on all cylinders and absolutely nails this film and something that I completely did not expect.

The awkward moments are funny but if that's not your kind of humour there are still many funny gags that don't rely on awkwardness.The movie has a generic family plot, but it works just fine and it doesn't need to be innovative for it to be a fun watch. It's all very good.There is a minor reveal at the end about Katie's character that really should have been built up better throughout the movie, we barely get hints about it and most of the people watching it will completly forget this aspect of her character - which sucks since it could have put her on a place where many people watching would perhaps see a bit of themselves in her since it's a marginalized group. The climax drags a little bit too and two characters could have been handled differently during it - but I reveal too much about the characters I'll end up getting into spoiler territory and I do not wish to do that. I also wish some of the jokes during the road trip plot could have been more abrupt because it would only amplify their impact - but hey, this criticism might as well be nitpicky at this point.Anyways, please go watch this movie, stop comparing it to Spiderverse and have your fun.",

The family drama is honestly the best part and could have been great if it stuck to that, but the rest of the movie involving the robot uprising was predictable and kind of stupid. The humor is definitely the worst thing though, since most of the jokes involve internet humor or meta one liners about how stupid something is that completely breaks the immersion it was setting. Also, the supposed lesbian representation was barely in it, as there are really no hints to go off through out the movie about the relationship between Katie and Jade and the only definitive thing we get is that Katie mentions at the end of the film that she would bring her home.The animation was nicely stylized throughout, which I found to be quite enjoyable, but it's such a shame such a great and cool looking animation aesthetic was wasted on such a mediocre script.",

It was a bit much for me, but it adds to the flavor of the film and I think would resonate more with a demographic younger than me.With however much is going on screen, the script is pretty tight. By focusing on the father daughter relationship and having every major theme connect to that somehow, the film comes across very streamlined. You really understand their relationship, and how they struggle to connect but nonetheless want to do something. We're given enough background to them and their emotions to feel their tensions and become invested. Balancing this family story with a wacky premise worked very well, and you can tell that the people who made this really loved what they were making.There's also a lot of genuinely funny moments that I laughed out loud at. Not every bit of humor works, but enough of it catered to my tastes.I would highly recommend this as a feel good family movie night, or for anyone just looking to have a good time and doesn't mind a bit of stereotypical weirdness.",

But while the exposition is great, setting up the emotional beats throughout the plot, the actual story could be more fleshed out. And the movie is also a little longer than necessary, I feel.

My expectations in the story arc were low from the beginning, but certain parts of it seemed so nonsensical to me that I could not fully enjoy it anymore. Since the overall tone is rather goofy, this does not matter as much as it would with a different kind of movie.Overall it was worth watching, but I would not watch it a second time.",

I honestly can't rave about this film enough. I've suggested it to all my friends with children as I expect this to be a classic of the next generation.Fantastic job overall and absolutely loved the references to the geo political issues with tech industries and treating LGBTQ+ Characters as human beings without needing to token these characters.10/10 studios could take some lessons from this film especially since the emoji movie came from Sony also.

It was the funniest film, hands down, that I have seen in at least 2 years.

They poorly designed the Pal Max Robots and how the heck could they could not tell if Monchi was a dog, a pig, or loaf of bread? Because he is overweight! That's why! And Monchi doesn't even look like a dog to begin with. How on earth did Eric and Deborahbot wake up if they are already crushed? That didn't work with other Pal Max Robots. What the heck?

            "review_title": "This is not going to be an ordinary review",
            "content": "This is one of the best animation movies of the last decade. Here is why:The story is incredibly gripping; catchy dialogues; huge humor and touching drama; the great balance between those two genres that also often transitions into action; a very decent twist; innovative animation style; It refers to wide range type of audience; extremely well delivered messages; and lastly... Everything is super relatable.Its fast pace is one of a kind that really stands out among any other blockbuster animations out there and I actually liked it, but it's very easy to miss or not understand some of the fast cut scenes and dialogues. This was my only issue but all the other awesomeness brought out with this movie easily compensates the rest.When it comes to the 'reality police' and 'I-want-to-scream-so-hard' reviewers... Claiming that this is not realistic at all.. The movie actually presents one of the most realistic, relatable and anticipated future stories out there. There are hundreds of other animations that are loved mainly for the execution of the graphics, the fun and certain delivered emotions within a fantasy script that has sub par realistic notions in it. Why don't you go ahead and criticize those instead? You rather give them 9/10 because you were so captivated by the fantasy world your eyes laid on or for some other bullcrap personal reasons. Be real with yourself.Whoa! Out of billions of families in the world, only them, Mitchells get to be left out and get to fight to save the world. What are the chances?! Whatever the chances of witnessing a few number living animals that belong to nearly extinct breed located on earth (endlessly destructed by us humans) :) Everything is possible. Deal with it. And for the love of... whatever you love the most divine...Find better sources to seek realism. And remember this is only a movie. An animation movie. Medium for your soul hence entertainment and meditation or whatever you might want to call it. And nothing about humans nor their creations are perfect and can never be.A lot of the things in the film are Americanized, modernized and were made seem like saving the USA meant saving the world (just like many made-in-USA movies and shows. How surprising!). When all the people were released out of their pods they were held captive in; it looked more like as if it was just the number of people of one city in a state of NA rather than even being one state of people, or the entire NA country not to mention \"the world\".So what?Yes, some parts and details could have been thought off better, but so what? Why all the perfectionism over it? Why all the hilarious nitpicking? Just adapt; sympathize; take what's good; note down the baddies; put them on a scale; then zoom out and look at it again for the overall perspective... Then give your rating. You wouldn't give a movie like this less than 7 out of 10 even if it didn't impress you as much. It is pretty objective to say that those who rated it lower than that have apparent non-viable criticism ethics, because they did it for any other reason but to review it with true eyes, mind and soul.In my sincere opinion, people who disliked this movie or somehow wanted to make it seem like it; rated it low; and wrote harsh criticism about it have serious issues. I can't wrap my head around the idea of how someone can hate an animation movie that has full of blissful, exciting, emotional, eye-tearing of laughter and emotions, and \"I've been there\" moments that also has right on spot humanity and relationship lessons including human psyche rendition. I was shocked not seeing the rating 9 or above. Honestly, this is what's wrong with some people. They simply can't see or accept what actually good or bad is. They also can't empathize, neither can have proper functioning judgment.Don't ever bother reading those ridiculous reviews or get fooled by them. It is a must-to-watch movie.I applaud every single person in the pre-production, production and post-production teams of The Mitchells vs The Robots. Very well-done guys. Respect.",

So here's my breakdown:The Animation:\nUnbelievably good styling. I don't think I've ever seen anyone combine the 3d styling of Illumination with cell shading that reminds me of a super high res TF2. Very fluid animation, very fun articulation of the character, absolutely beautiful scenery. The emoji style bursts really rounded out the visuals.The Story:\nFun beyond reason. Very well paced humor and every joke landed perfectly. Was the concept recycled? Sure. But lets be honest, what concept isn't?Overall Rating: If I could give this an 11/10 I would do so without question. I don't think I've ever seen a more soulful movie and I hope we see more from this studio.Not going to lie, I ended this movie with tears in my eyes because of how much I loved it.",

I feel like this movie would have been better if it didn't have all of the robot/sci-fi stuff and just focused on the Mitchell family themselves and their relationship with technology.

The jokes are funny, the writing is nice, the plotline is original and executed great. The character design and the effects in between the movie is great and adds the extra feeling that the movie is from Katie's perspective. But to be honest, I could care less about whatever the song is that has Katie and the father dancing at the end, that is about the only weirdness. But remember, I said the first go around is great. The second, to be honest, you of course can expect what happens. But the second viewing doesn't give you the same feeling as the first viewing, which really sucks. This could just be me and some people, and if you can watch it over and over against and love it, great. The second viewing lost its magnetic attraction it gave me to the first viewing.

You never see movies where the mother is blamed for ignoring her kids, its always the dad being uncaring. The film makers should have left their agenda at the door and just focused on making a great movie. This movie will join Wonder Park as joyless movies that I or my kids will never watch again.

By the end of the trailer i was laughing hysterically. And i decided to watch the movie.It was so witty and the jokes were creative not forcing and story felt close to heart. It's generic topic about family but the interesting part was the premise and crazy family is so much entertaining to watch i didn't expect all this. Even the story wasn't predictible so that was the best bit. Overall a great family movie very funny and entertaining. The creators deserves a kudos and the movie seems to be close to the hearts of the animators.",

To start off, it delves heavily into the meme culture, and while the meme are dated, they would be no matter what.The weakest point of the movie is the basic story--it isn't new nor revolutionary, which is a bit of a shame realizing that the writers were connected to Gravity Falls and Alex Hirsch was the story consultant. That being said, I do think fans of Gravity Falls would probably really enjoy this film.For me, the humor shined. What some may consider trying too hard at being quirky is par for the course for this writing team. The humor helped elevate a mediocre story into something enjoyable. Add in some touches of nostalgia, a few pointed stabs at social media and technology consumption, and a voice cast that delivers (many don't care for the directo stepping in to voice the brother, which is understandable, but I didn't mind), and it's a fun romp.",

Non-stop action, a rare inventiveness, but it is especially its humor that makes this animated feature irresistible! The jokes hit the nail on the head and we soon find ourselves with a smile on our face as we enjoy the wacky adventures of these unusual heroes.The second strength of the film comes from the emotion it gives off. Through its scenario, the story gives a lot of heart and this is felt in each scene. In particular those between Rick and his daughter, Katie, which shows how misunderstandings can create a wall despite an omnipresent love between them. A case in which many will be able to recognize themselves.\"The Mitchells vs. The Machines\" beats its competitors to the punch and gets a head start by offering us a welcome revival in the world of animation.Perhaps an \"instant classic\" in the making for new generations, at least I'm a fan and I want more!",

For too long animated films for kids/families bordered on basic styles that were easy to crank out for what was perceived as a simple audience, but The Mitches Vs The Machines has pride in itself unlike any movie I've seen. Mixed mediums, a 3D movie blocked like traditional 2D animation, and COLORS, oh my god, the colors. The action definitely holds up to their previous work on Spiderverse, and the stylized look lends amazingly well to it as well.The story itself is a little predicable, but that's to be expected with a movie aimed at kids/families, but just because it follows a familiar trend with the plot doesn't mean it's completely void of soul or surprises. They manage to take the traditional formula and update it, give it a more natural flow that feels right. Some of my favorite parts about the movie though is it has every opportunity to become some boomer anti-screen rhetoric about how tech makes us less connected these days, but steers clear of that narrative in favor of a much more wholesome and positive one. Also not to get too preachy, but it does a nice job of representation, Katie is very easily LGBT and in a way that feels organically hinted at, even the most veiled homophobe can't complain about it being \"forced on our youth\"I've been following this movie for months, and I can't tell you enough how much it was worth the wait.",

Chris Miller name was the only reason i watched this paper plane animation, i am disappointed and wasted my time with this.Just using LGBT and Black people in a Movie/Animation shouldn't make it a master piece and having the rating of this high.So many plots that were just not necessary and so many holes that they even forgot to fill before releasing this.don't watch it unless you got no other animation to watch or you want to be disappointed of Phil Lord and Chris Miller.",

We used to watch a lot of movies when we were younger. At first, I thought I'd just watch it by myself then my little sister overheard it playing on my tablet, so she joined and eventually, my little brother! This made watching this movie more exciting and extra special :DThe story, the animation, the voice acting, and the soundtrack? Top tier!! Just like what my sister said, \"10/10 would recommend!\"This is another great family movie that made me cry. Thanks, creators. No really, thank you!You made this movie something that my siblings and I will definitely remember in a long time that made us laugh, cry and smile.

Each joke produced at LEAST a chuckle, and sometimes I do actually feel it tries too hard, but it is still great. Aaron's VA was off putting at first, since it is a very deep and nasally voice in a little boy, but I grew to love it.

It is a family made up of a clumsy, paunchy father, a submissive mother with a very common job as a school teacher, a daughter, a son and a dog. Even the breed of the dog is so common and standard that it seems that this story was created from statistical data of the most common stuff in the USA.I simply chose to watch this movie because I was struck by the good rating it had, which I found inconsistent with the quality of the movie seen in the trailer. In the end I think it was the same robots that appear in the film that created these 10/10 reviews so that many people thought it was a good film.The Family and the plot are made up of so many clich\u00e9s, stereotypes, and ordinary characters that I suppose the target audience for which this film was created must be just as ordinary as the Mitchell family.",

            "content": "The Mitchells vs the Machines is about family relationship, particularly between a father and a daughter. The context of an apocalipse in which the machines have started a revolution against the humans is not only a background for the story themes, but also a clear part of it.First, the reason for the apocalipse is, in fact, the lack of care/consideration the CEO of the generic AI company had towards one of the \"products\". Hence, the family having to work together in order to survive and finally re-establish the global peace is sort of an antitheses to that. The leader AI proclaims that humans can't change, and are faded to their rotten nature, but in the end father and daughter are able to connect and understand each other, which is exactly what saves the world - the father and mother using tech, and the girl driving just like the father taught her. Because of this, it's clear the true conflict of the movie is not what is literally being displayed on the screen (the battle against the robots itself), but rather the troubled relationship in the family.The animation is very fluid (which is a given because... CGI) and the art is well done in general. In many action scenes I liked the lighting and color pallet. Personally, the integration of \"real life\" videos/memes simply did not work and the jokes related to it just fell flat. In fact, I was not a fan of the comedy here at all, but I imagine kids will like it.So, in conclusion, in technical aspects, it's very well done, and opposed to most animated properties, it actually has something to say - there is some subtext. However, it's nothing new, groundbreaking, or thought provoking enough to make you gain another perspective.",

I don't enjoy photo/video filters much, but the stylistic approach was at least OK by me.Very weak plot - almost everything works out by chance for the Mitchells. Every 5 minutes they take a leap of faith and it works out.Annoying physics/reality - taken from Marvel's and other superhero movies, where falling from incredible heights or coming to an abrupt stop from a high fall leaves the people a bit dizzy at the worst. A kilometer high structure filled with people falls over and that DOESN'T leave a gory pile of flesh and intestines - instead everybody climbs out happy? A crappy car can jump and fall and crash and is impossible to hit/catch up with super advanced, Ironman style robots? And a \"mother's rage\" is more destructive than T1000 style superfast killer robots, which can nano-assemble or something? And everybody masters the art of skysurfing in a few minutes? Ugghhhhhh. I'm okay with make-believe, I can even accept the pug-bread confusion, but otherwise this was supposed to be \"realistic\" and in our real world, wasn't it?Mediocre characters - I liked that the siblings' relations were friendly and supportive. What was wrong with the father for not having taken interest in his daughter's activities for a decade or so? As others pointed out - it took a literal end of the world for him to find out what his daughter was doing and passionate about. Why?Cultural nods - why not. Missed probably some of those as I used my native language voice-over.Conclusion - a mixture of barely unrelated stuff in a very intense sauce, visually ok/pleasant, but lacking substance and plausibility. I wonder how long I'd last with the people giving this movie 8-10 points? Would be an interesting cultural experience, I guess (and I wouldn't mind being so enthusiastic about something so simple, for a while).",

Ha. He's got a big ego & refuses to change, & it's affecting his relationship with his daughter. I love how they show the love, bond, & sacrifices Rick makes for his family & daughter. I cry every time I see those scenes. Yes, the robot apocalypse story has been done before, but that's not the point. It's about the trials & tribulations families go thru. Families are messy, but there's nothing stronger than the love, bond, & security you feel with your family. I also love how it touches on technology & how we need to put the devices down for a bit & start interacting with our families & living our lives.Whether you have kids or you were once a kid, I feel like everyone can relate to this story in some way. We've all felt like our parents didn't understand us when we were kids, & it's becoming even more apparent today with technology. Excellent writing, beautiful animation, & many life lessons we could all learn from. The only negative I would give is the casting for the brother. I believe the director did the voice & it was not a good choice. It totally threw me off. I couldn't tell if he was 5 or 15. Very poor choice. Other than that, well done!

The best thing about it: the heart and the genuine family dynamics and healthy relationship growth.

We laughed at some of the very relatable jokes, pointed fingers at who was who in the movie. It was nice to be able to sit down with our older children and enjoy something.By the way, to those that didn't like the type of animation and the storyboard of the movie, it doesn't always have to be over the top. The simplistic type style and design was a great change from the typical animation you see nowadays. This movie was visually appealing. Great Job. Definitely the best movie since the pandemic hit. Would have loved to have seen it in the movie theater, but home was nice too. Highly recommend this movie.",

But for me the main point is that it kept me laughing the whole way through.Yes, some parts were forced, and yes, there are plot holes. To me that was actually part of the fun! I felt like those moments made for a fun, surreal, over the top experience that actually made me enjoy it all the more.The characters were lovable and portrayed with care. I loved the approach to wildly different problems.Honestly viewing the reviews I fell like many adults didn't fully understand many of the sub plots of the movie, which is truly a shame.Nonetheless, I think both children and adults will enjoy this movie very much.

In general, this cartoon is not bad, it's cool to watch his family, because it raises age-old problems, such as the problems of parents and children, the environment that we change real communication on the phone and in a rather hyperbolized form, tells what it can lead to. Of course there are some nuances, for example the graphics sometimes just get out of control and it was very strange to watch. In addition, we must not forget that this cartoon is still more aimed at younger audiences, because the story is easy and unpretentious, but it raises problems for adults and therefore it is difficult to say which viewer it will suit 100%. But the humor there is very accurate, vital, some moments really funny. The characters are well written, of course the poor little brother is completely forgotten, he is almost gone, but in principle, the conflicts between the characters are very detailed. As for the plot, of course, this is primarily a cartoon and the main twists are provided here, so who is the main thief and how the characters will be weakened, I understood at the beginning of the film. Well, as for the final, of course it all ended with a standard happy end, nothing special. So, as a cartoon for one or more views, this is usually a good option, but be prepared for bright pictures and a more or less predictable plot.",

The film is about a girl named Katie who is going off to college to pursue her career in film making, she and her father Rick seem to have trouble bonding and understanding each other in what they wanted for her, kinda like in a Goofy Movie. Now already I can relate to this character, as a filming major myself she's very creative in what she makes so I can really understand what she wants for herself but at the same time I can't help but feel sympathy for Rick (especially during the climax) because he knows his daughter is growing up and it's really neat how they eventually reconnect with each other within the story. As far as visuals go this film really looks gorgeous from the luscious color pallet to the unique character designs this film looks really well crafted. I have to say Sony is really making some winners in animation, to think this was the studio that made The Emoji Movie, and following up the next year they won an Oscar with Into the Spider-Verse it just shows that Sony really can make good pictures and I'd say they're on the right track! So overall this movie is full of heart, passion, humor and beauty, so yeah if it wasn't obvious I'd recommend you'd check it out!",

It's such an easy thing to get right, I can't think why it was allowed to happen (except for the fact he's voiced by the director so I guess it's some sort of vanity project).

Sure, the animation is outstanding (and that must be admitted), and in the end the movie tries to convey a very good message. And that's all the good honestly, now I will say why I have not enjoyed it so much.The film is full of plot holes, many of them some people could justify it by saying that it is a comedy film, but being comedy does not justify that there is no internal logic. Examples: The Mitchell family dog \u200b\u200bis supposed to cause robot failures by not being able to distinguish between whether it is a dog or a cow ... Are you telling me that the Mitchell family is the only family that has a dog? The invasion could not have been successful. That already leaves the plot inconsistent from the beginning!Another may be when Linda fights with the robots at the end of the movie. Many situations like these are super forced just to complete the plot and force comedy situations into it. If comedy were the core of the film, and there was only that, AND comedy was GOOD, it would be more or less forgivable. But not! The film as I said before, tries to convey a message, and there are several serious situations to reflect this. Personally, the film does not have a good balance between comedy and story, and both elements end up falling, since both the comedy and the story itself is super cliche, forced and predictable. The best way to describe this movie would be: a festival of memes. Because it is what it is, a humor that is no longer funny (and I think it never was imo). This movie doesn't know what it wants to be in that sense! They constantly expose you to a serious situation, and then a cliche joke, and so on for most of the plot.Don't get me wrong, not everything is bad in this movie. But is far from being a masterpiece. I think is mediocre at worst and ok at best.",

I went in with moderate expectations but came out thoroughly impressed. This has a great visual style provided by the same people behind The Lego Movie and Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse. The animation style pops and feels unique compared to other animated films which I liked. I also love how the animation was used to incorporate comedy because the film is pretty hilarious. If you don\u2019t enjoy subtle pop culture references then you might not like the comedy but I think the set up and punchline of almost every joke worked. They even pause the film at times to make a joke which worked sometimes and other times it kinda deflated the tension but it didn\u2019t bother me that much. A lot of these story beats feel very similar which is a common complain I hear and I do kinda agree with it. There really wasn\u2019t a lot story and thematically wise that surprised me but I still like it because the writing is great. While the basic story threads are predictable, the circumstances are nice and refreshing with a take over the world kind of story. It was a fun take on a story that can be seen as predictable. I thought the emotional beats the film laid out hit a lot and some of it hit different for me as I am also going away to film school just like the main character. The characters all feel very fun and refreshing and I liked their little arcs that they went through and the voice cast did a great job as well with it. If you are a fan of animation then you will love this film. I would highly recommend checking it out.",

THEN I HATE IT AGAIN, THEN I LOVE IT AGAIN! The film flip flops between being good and bad for me so much it's jarring. This is one of the most mixed feelings I've had for any recent movie. I can tell there was clearly passion put into the making of this film, and the art direction and camera work is good and really professional. But then the voice over work is shawty; where characters sound like they're in a bubble and then sound perfectly normal. If it was a story decision, then moments like the rooftop scene wouldn't sound like they were recorded in a house room.The biggest problem I have with this movie, and I'll get this out of the way now, is that for all the amount of times the characters SAY they're the \"most dysfunctional family ever\", the Mitchells are probably the most functional, understanding, and communicative family I have ever seen put on screen... The mother cares for everybody in the family, the son is supportive of his sister, the dog gets along with everyone, and the father, for all his flaws, literally wants nothing more than to connect with his family through nature and family bonding. I think the one who I like out of all the Mitchells is the dad, he catches a lot of heat from his family but literally just wants to do the right thing by them. But, for all this seem good on the surface, it's bad for establishing character conflict. We are only ever told that their's conflict between Katie and her father, Rick, but the closest we ever get to seeing it are several very mild instances of arguments that, quite honestly, felt so minuscule to get worked up over, they didn't even feel like character conflicts. Katie tries to show him something cool, and Rick tries to show her something cool about nature, and she walks away miserably. Another time, Rick gets gives his opinion on Katie's future and how he feels that she needs a backup plan if things go south, which he APOLOGIZES FOR IMMEDIATELY, he knows what he's saying is stupid, but no, instead of trying to understand him, Katie takes this as a sign of aggression. All this leads to an accident, where in the heat of the moment, Rick tries to take Katies laptop to see her full video, and he accidentally breaks it. Notice that I said \"ACCIDENTALLY\", because he meant well but caused an accident. If the accident was caused by, lets say - for instance - Rick being more of an a-hole, and then arguing with his daughter about how she spends way too much time on her phone and calls her selfish, and she fires back calling him a deadbeat father who doesn't understand her. Then it evolves into an even more serious argument - her being lgbt - she tells him she's never understood him, and he tells her he doesn't want her to change. Then, he takes the laptop because he says he thinks it'll be good for her to not have it, then the tug of war between the two of them happens... and then... like before, the laptop gets broken.To me, this is a much more interesting way of establishing conflict in the characters. She want's to be herself, but he wants her to be who she was before, then the tug of war with the laptop symbolizes their broken bond as father and daughter. With the previous scene, all we have is a father and daughter not agreeing on the OPINIONS about what life direction she should take, and the father is a blubbering idiot. And that's all establishes in this scene, that the father is an idiot. But with this new scene, it adds more weight to the film, bringing up some serious topics that are relatable and, when done right, makes the audience more engaged than ever before.The reason I wanted to bring her being lgbt to the forefront is because it was such an insignificant thing to the movie. And what I mean by that is that having that be basically/kinda/sort of revealed at the end of the movie (with obvious hints at the beginning) does little to effect the plot, which I feel is missed potential. It's much more relatable to have that aspect of her be a plot point the dad needs to get over in addition to the already established \"Katie needs to get along with her dad\" plot point.Wish I could say more, but can't because of Metacritic's max word limit. I'll say that I hated the tone flip flopping from comedy to seriousness rapidly in scenes, the serious and comic parts need to be cut, and need room to breathe. But the serious moments that land, land very very well. I love the dynamics between the family on the road trip, even if it feels forced that Katie is just \"fine\" with the road trip, and still uses her phone. The product placement is jarring, cut most of it out. And cut down compilation score, use more classic score and keep some pop music.This film is a huge mixed bag(5), almost a 4 actually, a lot of missed potential and a lot to be desired. But their is clearly passion put into this, and that is admirable.",

So even as someone who has enjoyed the likes of Hop andSony Pictures Animation has been behind a number of critical misfires over the years and are responsible for one of the greatest cinematic travesties of all time with The Emoji Movie. So even as someone who has enjoyed the likes of Hop and the first Smurfs, I myself am blown away by the fact that they just managed to release something that rivals the best works from the likes of Disney and Pixar. Make no mistake, The Mitchells vs. The Machines is one the freshest, most inventive, and highest quality animated films across the board to come out over the past few years.What's remarkable is that it's not even doing anything that new thematically. The premise involving a dysfunctional family coming together to stop a robot apocalypse is certainly novel and the whole thing is backed by a one-of-a-kind sense of visual flair, but the real heart of the story centered around the strained relationship of a father and daughter who simply don't \"get\" each other is nothing we haven't seen before. It even makes use of the old clich\u00e9 plot device where the dad forces his family into an impromptu road trip in an effort to try and repair things.What allows the movie to achieve some emotional resonance despite this are the characters themselves. The Mitchells are a lovable group of oddball outcasts. As someone who himself has always been a bit different from everyone else and experiences his own familial woes, I related to them and their non-machine related plight in my own way. Something that was made easier by the fact that, while over-the-top, their idiosyncrasies weren't so ridiculous that I couldn't see something of myself inside each one of them.When it's not tugging on the ol' heartstrings, The Mitchells is tickling your funny bone with maximum efficiency. It fires a near-constant volley of jokes almost always hit their target without going outside the realm of family-friendly, and poke fun at things like the always plugged in nature of modern day life while critiquing the kind of problematic behavior tech companies often engage in, such as Zuckerbergian data harvesting. This is on top of providing a number of exciting setpieces that help ensure the entire experience is a zany, touching, and hilarious blast for the whole family all the way through. Unless you're among the super conservative type, in which case the presence of a gay main character will likely be a turn off.It's something of a minor tragedy that due to covid this ended up having to release on Netflix. While a huge win for the streaming service and its subscribers, this was honestly worthy of a theater ticket and I would have recommended it be seen on the big screen if only to better appreciate all of the little details in the animation itself. So if you need another reason to sign up for that monthly fee look no further. In all seriousness this may have dethroned Stranger Things as the best content on the platform.9.4/10",

What immediately struck me was the wonderful (I really like) the animation, which is in the style of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. But it doesn't end with animation and I think the story is really nice. A family that is a bit crazy, but each character has something and each of them gets their time, which is great. I liked the main heroine the most, but the others will also get space. There's a joke here and there and the world wondered, I liked it and I laughed a few times and I'm telling you, I really don't have to do comedy. In all this, great music also appears in the film, and imagine when you have a beautiful stylization, a perfect story and even great music. That must be great, right?

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nI like this film a lot; quite possibly one of the most quality replayable films I have viewed in my life. Now considering myself, this is a rather unorthodox say, especially coming from me, who despises any entertainment made by 20th century people that attempts to adapt to 21st century culture. However, this film is a certain exception to that rule.Since this film is primarily comedy and more uses family relationships as a secondary plot element, that much should be very clear to absolutely any film critic who sees this, I will not be speaking from the perspective of that and instead take it in the form of a comedy, as it was intended to be during its 'Connected' era.First of all, the plot and characters are more special than one would assume, and are absolutely not 1-dimensional beings like they have been claimed as. I predicted certain events based on CWACOM 2, one of Columbia Pictures' other iconic films released in 2013, 8 years prior. Turns out I was correct in certain regards, starting off with an idol being betrayed and a protagonist turning out an outsider that is ridiculed due to public misunderstanding. Columbia Pictures likes to be subversive and inventive with whatever they come across, so typically, certain predictions were inaccurate. The basic plot is that a dysfunctional family cancels their daughter's trip to college for film in order to go on a road trip around America, then interfered by the tech uprising by proxy of a single tech company taking priority over absolutely anything technological in the universe known as PAL Labs, the obvious insincere tech company CEO-parody Mark Bowman's betrayal of PAL, the cellphone that uses the company's name, being the prime cause of the uprising in question, of which the cellphone then claims that a reason will cause her to stop exterminating humanity only to reveal later on that she is a misanthrope who overall doesn't care, forcing the family to embark on a quest to save the planet and experiencing countless, then-unresolved social conflicts along the way.Considering that, this is a very effective use and parody of all media companies and all 2000s nuclear families in general, though there are some very particular moments where the technology is basically physically impossible in function, making the film difficult to watch is a technology nerd. There may be some awkward moments featuring those parodies of the media including the filters, but in reality, that is more of an attempt to mock those filters and the people who use them than it is to act in agreement with them. This film isn't conforming to 2000s culture the same way The Emoji Movie did so by placing obvious product placements constantly, trying to remain humble in its message of corporate corruption and potential commentary of corporate intentions, only using the PAL concept for anything corporate.As for the title characters who make the film in the first place, the screenplay definitely knew the direction it was going in regards to them as well. They're definitely better than most Western characters I have seen, and my Western fiction culture count goes into the thousands. They are intended to represent a dysfunctional family, but not so much that they can't be rooted for, in that they have altruistic intentions in their actions unlike a realistic dysfunctional family, of which would likely be as misanthropic as they are chaotic. That makes them entertaining, and gives them entertaining running gags too. But the one who strikes the most interest is the outsider main protagonist, who stands out in both appearance and personality by being the rebellious teenage girl, who is also a genius film director, producer, and publisher altogether since she was an elementary school student. The one blatant lie she tells in the whole film is the one where Rick tells the family to play it safe by remaining in Dino Stop, and she motivates him with a lie after getting an idea that she believes will allow her to be able to go to college like she initially planned to do before the road trip, of course naively telling her true intentions to her brother. Later on in the film, she tries to prevent Rick from seeing this due to PAL's constant attempts to expose the Mitchells among the PALs, to no avail, and as a result, she temporarily becomes the hated among the family before reforming by saving them all with her own genius. Overall, this is one of the best modern films I have watched to this day.",

What could be better than a nice, family-friend animated movie? How about an animated action-comedy about the robot apocalypse - Robocalypse? Enter Netflix with The Mitchells vs. The Machines. Is this just watch the therapist ordered? Here goes...The Mitchells vs. The Machines is an animated action-comedy about a typical middle-American family that embarks on a road trip to take the oldest child, Katie Mitchell, to film school in California. As it so happens, the robot apocalypse arrives in the middle of their trip. Here, Katie Mitchell is an aspiring filmmaker, always behind her camera and struggling to find her community through her artistic expression. Rick Mitchell, the father, doesn't understand Katie or anything about technology, really. The brewing tension between father and daughter bubbles over as Katie desperately wants to escape home and find her place at film school. In a bid to recapture their old bond, Rick packs up the family and plans to drive Katie to school across country as last minute family outing. As most cross-country family adventures go, the Mitchells are suffering through disappointing roadside attractions and general claustrophobia until the machines come and force the family to work together to save the world. It all happens in the way only an animated movie can do.There's a lot to recommend in this movie. First, the visual style is amazing. There is a lot of kinetic energy to the animation. You won't know where to look and the detail is inspiring. It is clever how there seems to be a mixed-media quality to the animation. It could get overwhelming at times, but it is never boring. Moreover, all of the various visual styles complement the story. Second, the writing hit the marks you would want from an action-adventure-comedy animated movie. There are sight gags that reference technology and social media. Fred Armisen and Beck Bennett play dim-witted robots, who team up with the Mitchells, and they add to the humor. Olivia Colman give a great voice-performance as the A. I. villain, who set the robot apocalypse in motion. She has the wit and mischievousness that these animated villains need. While there are some apocalypse tropes that pop up throughout, there is a lot more that feels fresh that what could be cliched does not completely derail the good time.My biggest gripe about The Mitchells vs. The Machines is that it takes a long time to get to the \"vs. The Machines\" part of the movie. There is a lot of set up. Obviously, the goal of the set up is so that the audience invests in the success of the family, particularly the rekindling of the father-daughter relationship; but, I felt that it took too long. Further, once the movie does get to the \"vs. The Machines\" part, while it is satisfying and entertaining, it also becomes too much of a good thing. At an hour and 49 minutes, the movie is too long and could have hit all of the action-comedy marks, including the emotional climax, if some extraneous things had been cut.Netflix certainly delivered with this one. The Mitchells vs. The Machines is a great family film that has nice themes about both individuality and family togetherness. There is humor and heart throughout. The action is entertaining and the animation is visually intriguing. Gather the family with a big box of popcorn and enjoy the Robocalypse.",

It\u2019s like the directors of the movie were changed every 10 minutes. Sometimes the movie is absolutely amazing, and sometimes it\u2019s just\u2026 well, too much of the good stuff. My main complaints is that they\u2019re trying to make it look like it\u2019s through the eyes of Katie, the photoshop girl, but 90% of the time they do it it heavily interferes with the movie because a 2D drawing looks very out of place in a 3D animated movie. Not to mention that when they try to do that heavily, it just looks more like it was made by an amateur instead of someone trying to capture the feeling of how Katie sees the world. For example, during the \u201cscreaming monkey\u201d joke, wich happens twice, they have it on screen for WAY too long. Its like the joke was directed by the people behind Family Guy. And although there are only a few of those out-of-place lengthy jokes, it\u2019s almost as if they were engineered to be included in the scenes where they are most out of place. They\u2019re trying to make it look like it\u2019s through the eyes of Katie, but they just end up looking like someone used KineMaster to put stock-free effects over it.My other main complaint is the \u201cfamily bondage in a robot apocalypse\u201d style they\u2019re going with. I\u2019m not saying it was a bad choice, in fact, I think it\u2019s amazing and a lot of times it mixes together extremely well, but a few times it\u2019s just, well, out of place.Although, there aren\u2019t only negative aspects of this movie. In fact, it was a pretty good movie. It\u2019s got a great animation style, attention to detail, and although like I\u2019ve just ranted about, the jokes are most of the time very well pulled off. The plot is good, although it\u2019s got a lot of \u201cwhy didn\u2019t the antagonist just do this if it can do that\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s almost impossibly lucky\u201d parts, it\u2019s not a big deal.Overall, I\u2019d give this movie a 7. It\u2019s like it was on path to become one of the best movies of all time, but then due to a shortage of time before the deadline they had to round some things up quickly.I\u2019d definitely recommend this movie: although it is not a masterpiece, it\u2019s still pretty good and worth watching.",

Yeah its kinda predictable but still enjoyable. This movie is actually really funny but there are also lots of heartfelt moments. The movie includes random hand drawn type effects which look like something Katie, the main character, would add if she was making the movie herself which is really nice.
