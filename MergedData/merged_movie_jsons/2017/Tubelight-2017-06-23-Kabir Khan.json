Salman Khan tried to do a Koi Mil Gya Character here but falls flat. Worst part is the thing which you hate most in movie is none other than Salman Khan, this movie is even bad than London Dreams and Jaaneman. Biggest disaster movie from Khan released on Eid. A complete journey of boredom that simply never ends, when leading actor disappoint at such a level than other supporting cast good acting was also ignored that happen with Sohail part here, he was very god in his extended cameo role. I am Salman Khan fan and watched all of his movies enjoyed all of them but his 3 movies Jaaneman, London Dreams and this are really painful but in other 2 movies Salman was average but in this movie I am running our of words how bad his acting was.At least this type of movie was not expected from kabir Khan who lacks completely on Direction part.I Will rate this 2/10",

            "content": "Kabir Khan & Salman Khan are a combo to reckon with. Their first collaboration was the Smash Hit Ek Tha Tiger & was followed by an All-Time Blockbuster with Bajrangi Bhaijaan. Expectations from their latest effort 'Tubelight' are expectedly gargantuan. But sadly, 'Tubelight' fails to deliver.Reason? 'Tubelight' stands on a faulty script, that despite noble intentions, never takes flight. This tale of two torn-brothers aims to be an affecting tale on brotherhood & love, but what is eventually served here, is a bland film, that never hits the point.'Tubelight' Synopsis: Laxman (Salman), a man-child simpleton, believes his faith will bring back his brother Bharat (Sohail Khan), who gets lost while in Battlefield in the Sino-Indian War. 'Tubelight' stands on a tiny plot & Writer-Director Kabir Khan gets stuck midway. Once Bharat leaves for war, the narrative just becomes stoic. And Laxman's relentless effort to bring back his brother with the power of 'faith' is overlong & tedious. Also, the sub-plot involving Laxman's relationship with a Chinese Family, of a mother & child, don't add much to the goings-on. To give its due, 'Tubelight' begins well & the camaraderie between real & reel life brothers offers genuine charm. But that doesn't last long. In short, 'Tubelight' doesn't make good use of its tiny plot & just goes on 136-minutes. Kabir Khan's Writing is the weakest link here. Though his intentions are to deliver a noble message of love & peace, but the Writing isn't tight enough. Also, there are too many songs in the film & they only drag the film. Khan's Direction is alright. Aseem Mishra's Cinematography is fantastic. His work deserves all the credit, as 'Tubelight' is a visual delight. Editing needed to crisper. Pritam's Score is nice, but the songs don't appear useful in the film beyond a point. Art & Costume Design are decent.Performance-Wise: Salman falls flat in his portrayal of Laxman. As a man-child driven by unshakable faith, the superstar tries to stretch the actor in him & even makes a sincere effort to justify the part, but his performance appears mechanical. Its sad that both Kabir & Salman aren't in form this time around. Sohail Khan gets little to do as Bharat, although his scenes with Salman are sweet. The Late/Great Om Puri shines in his final role as Salman & Sohail's mentor. The Legend grabs your attention in a supporting role. Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub is perfectly mean as the bully. Matin Rey Tangu & Zhu Zhu lend able support. Yashpal Sharma is wasted. And Shahrukh Khan barely leaves a mark in a cameo.On the whole, 'Tubelight' offers very little light! A Huge Disappointment!",

Nor why Tubelight did so poorly at the box office.This is such a watchable movie. The story was interesting, the locations were fantastic, the acting good, the cinematography exemplary, even the songs were catchy .... what more is required for a film to be entertaining?At worst I could say that it stretched a bit, just a bit, and perhaps there was too much music. The story is meant to be fictional and every film isn't meant to depict absolute stark reality. Tubelight held my interest, made me laugh, made me smile and even made me cry my heart out towards the end ... just before the happy ending! Salman was great as Laxman and the little child Matin was adorable. Om Puri - I think his last film .... may he Rest In Peace. Every actor performed well.I enjoyed Tubelight and I am really glad that I do not choose to watch films based on critics reviews.",

Everyone before the release was like \"tubelight will break Bahubali's collection\"But after the release after hearing initial reports producers reaction be like -\"Hope at least it will get more than bahubali actor's salary\"positives-1.)Salman khans innocent and childish acting. He has that cute charmness on his face and i really loved his performance. (Only thing which can make you glued to the screen)2.)Shahrukhan's cameo. His presence and combo scenes with salman was good.(celebration for both the fans)3.)Brother bonding scenes (emotional)Negatives-rest all are negatives and gives viewers a big headache.Overall- If you have any enemy's please take them to this movie or if you want to breakup with your girlfriend then this movie is the best option. Try it. (Try at your own Risk)",

            "content": "TUBELIGHT is a story about a man's unshakeable belief. Based on the adage, 'Faith can move mountains', the film revolves around the life of a simpleton named Laxman Singh Bisht (Salman Khan). Because of his exceedingly gullible nature, he gets nicknamed as 'tubelight', thanks to his inability to grasp, understand and analyse things like others. The story starts off with a narration by Laxman, wherein he takes the audiences through his childhood to adulthood. While the world doesn't take him seriously, the one man who always stands by Laxman and has complete faith in him is his younger brother Bharat Singh Bisht (Sohail Khan). One day, in the wake of the Indo-China war, the Indian Army invites applications from young Indians to join the army and serve the nation at the time of crisis. While Laxman gets rejected outright, Bharat gets chosen to be a part of the Indian army to go to the border to fight against the Chinese invasion. Life falls apart for Laxman when he gets to know that there is no contact with Bharat and that he may have died in the war. That's when Banney chacha (the late Om Puri) tells Laxman to have faith that his brother Bharat will return. Does Laxman Singh Bisht's faith fight the test of time, does Bharat Singh Bisht return back home safely, and what happens ultimately of the Indo-China war is what forms the rest of the film.While the promos of TUBELIGHT simply 'lightened' up everyone's excitement about the film, the film fails to live upto its title and eventually falls flat completely. The film's story (Kabir Khan) is raw, extremely half-baked and totally convoluted. The film's screenplay (Kabir Khan, Parveez Shaikh) is very convenient and rests on a wafer thin plot that gets stretched way too long, thus, spoiling the film's novelty in a big way. The screenplay seems to have been born out of convenience rather than conviction. Even though the film has been based on the adage 'Faith can move mountains', TUBELIGHT just does not hold any kind of solid content to mirror the same. The film is not at all convincingly made in the context of a backdrop of a war as it lacks the emotional connect with the audiences. The film's dialogues (Manurishi Chadha) are just about average and very much unlike a typical 'Salman Khan film'.",

It seems that someone else of his name has directed the film. Director must be aware of the lead actor strength because of his long association with him but in this movie he totally exposed actors weakness. In emotional scenes sometimes lead actor looks funny sometimes irritating. All characters and actors in film look visibly alone even being connected to each other. Film is so slow that you pray to its end in climax. First they punch you irritating assumed emotional pre climax then kick you with childish climax. That shoe exchange excuse is so stale and repeated. Kid looks cute but then his name was kept, thinking it is funny but repetition of his name sounds eventually filthy. Background gun shots sounds as cannon shot. I just cherished a moment when lead actor throws ash and second lead actor runs and then diffuses as ash. Performance wise all good actors are wasted. Especially lead actor doesn't fit this character.",

            "content": "Movie: Tubelight (U)Rating: 4.5/5Salman Khan: the star who has delivered a lot of commercial successes comes up with something different this time. Since this isn't usually what he delivers, I can't say that this film will turn out to be a big box office success. Largely because Indian audiences still don't understand what to expect from a film after seeing the trailer. The trailer already what kind of a film this one was going to. The negative reviews did make me doubt my choice of watching this film. But after I watched TUBELIGHT, I realized that it's indeed a very powerful and engaging film while it's entertaining too.TUBELIGHT is not what one usually expects from a Salman Khan films, so obviously it might not impress everyone. But will definitely work for those who love emotional films. The emotional scenes are portrayed very well and almost every such scene brought tears in my eyes. Salman Khan is indeed the biggest strength of the film as it's hard to imagine someone else do the character he did. It's really commendable that he did something of this grade. Sohail Khan, the late Om Puri, Zeeshan Ayyub, Martin and Zhu Zhu give good performances and every character is very well written.The story and screenplay of TUBELIGHT hold a lot of promise, and the film delivers on that front. The music is good. The action sequences are well filmed, and so are the locales captured. The editing is fine but could've been better towards the end as the pre-climax episode seems a little extended. But the film still holds your attention with the power of emotion and you leave your seat with a different experience. This must be enough to summarize how good the climax is.Overall, TUBELIGHT is a different experience so it will definitely entertain those who love such kind of emotional war-action drama films. Salman Khan's name is enough to bring people to the theatres. And further, Kabir Khan's solid direction is enough to entertain them with something they'll love to take home.",

            "content": "What do you in life when you are bullied, laughed and doubted - you believe in yourself. If you believe in yourself and the keep the hope alive, nothing can beat you. Tubelight, remake of critically acclaimed \"A Little Boy\", does sends out the message but is far from being properly executed .. Tubelight tells the story of a special man (Salman Khan) whose IQ is well-below his age but is a gem-of-a-person. Praying for his brother's (Sohail Khan) return from Indo-China War, he starts fulfilling a wish list.Kabir Khan, who gave us some memorable films like \"Kabul Express\", \"New York\" and \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\", Tubelight will come as shock for his followers and especially for Salman Khan's fans. The well intentioned film sits on a wafer-thin plot and the screenplay is weaker than a woman's tear. Of course, there are few moments which is enthralling. For instance, Salman Khan taking courage to slap his naysayer who he hurts the Chinese family. The scene where Salman Khan thoughts that his brother is dead at the Army camp and closes his ears pretending not to hear the sad news is one of the finest moments from the film. Unfortunately, the scenes are less to keep up the momentum of the film which falls flat on the face and tumbles down into a rabbit hole.Cinematography is superb capturing the beautiful locals of Manali, Kashmir and Ladakh. Art direction is pretty impressive. Background score is just about okay while the music piece by Pritam is decent with \"Radio\" song being best of the lot and well-choreographed. Coming to the performance, Salman Khan tried something different with his honest performance. However, few scenes I felt he was overboard and could have worked on his expression. Zhu Zhu was good in her part. The young chap playing \"Guo\" was amazing. Sohail Khan was just about okay while Om Puri and Mohmammed Zeeshan Ayub were excellent.Overall, Tubelight has been a big disappoint. Watch it only if you have not seen \"A Little Boy\".

            "content": "Kabir Khan's films are always based on magnification of a small idea that looks good on theory, but becomes preposterous on reel. His latest Bollywood feature drama is the newest example.Laxman (Salman Khan) is a dim-witted young man who lives with his younger brother Bharat (Sohail Khan) in a small North Indian town. He is called \"tubelight\" by his fellow town-dwellers because of his doltish nature and his inability to muster general things at the usual human pace. Bharat knows that his brother needs his support to survive, but still enlists himself for the army. With no one else to go to, Laxman now finds solace in a young boy named Guo (Matin Rey Tangu) who everybody misguidedly thinks hails from China, a neighboring country which India is currently at war with.Director Khan, along with co-writer Parveez Sheikh, narrate a straightforward story here and try to exaggerate it beyond limits. The basic idea that they try to convey is about Laxman's undying love for his brother and his unabashed faith in this love that will possibly help his brother come back hale and hearty post the war. As stated earlier, while that story looks good on paper, watching the Khan brothers enact it with a couple of supporting actors (albeit talented) is real pain. Mostly because the whole drama is highfalutin nonsense that does not induce any kind of emotion, let alone tears. An added dash of ambiguous magical realism does not help either, as one will find out if one manages to finish watching the film.Although, the film is too politically correct to not appeal to the average Indian audience. Of course, it may not matter to the international crowd, but when the makers inculcate thoughts of patriotism (nationalism, if I may) into the dialogues, one knows what the story is trying to achieve, and thus pay attention. One could look at this film as a message to the several unpatriotic citizens of India who should sign up for the army and look for Laxman's prayers to stay alive. Utter nonsense! Forget what's in the epitaph and hail the country!At the end, however, one realizes that all that Laxman did was fool around with his new friend and his friend's mother. For an average film-goer, the experience would be foggy, unsatisfying, and deeply disappointing because of factors that are not only related to a poor script. The quality of acting is not that great either. Watching Salman Khan wince as he tries to act like a half-witted grown-up is cringe-worthy. The popular notion that he cannot act might finally be becoming more apparent. His brother Sohail has a small yet pivotal role, and he too seems over-occupied. Supporting actors Om Puri, Zeeshan Ayyub, Zhu Zhu, Tangu, and Brijendra Kala put up a better show.The score is ambient, but the songs did add to the stupidity of the entire 2-hour long show. I am personally not against songs in Bollywood films, but when they are unnecessary, it's better to leave them out. Some exciting shots of northern locales of India, but other than that, it's just Salman and his borderline mockery.Overall, there are far too many negatives in this film, which is a remake of a 2015 Mexican film called Little Boy. Even if you are optimistic about the Kabir-Salman duo or are a fan of any of the actors, skipping it would be in the best of your interests. Do not even watch the original.BOTTOM LINE: Kabir Khan's \"Tubelight\" must be an ambitious project, considering that it released during a big festival time in India, but as standalone cinema it does not hold any ground. You might as well switch off this tube light.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES",

Om puri and the little child. rest it just feels like a safe bet by kabir khan, put a goody goody world and ppl will grab it.of course one can't argue with salman fans as they get personal in case anyone criticises the movie. how ever it's more important to understand who exactly are they helping in this case, their IQ or Salman Khan",

I was disappointed.This movie means well and wants us love our neighbors, but when the main man of the movie (this movie is 95% Salman) is unconvincing and at times, annoying, you just cant enjoy the movie. I liked what Salman did in Bajrangi. I didn't like what Salman did in this. I cant make up my mind on if he was trying too hard to be a convincing disabled childlike-man or not trying at all, because most of the times the camera was on Salman, he's making extremely silly and at times annoying distorted faces. I know kids and people with similar disabilities do that too, but what Salman was doing looked like he was making fun of such people, far from convincing us that he was one of them. Then again, making Salman play a disabled childlike man was never a good idea.This movie can get emotional (trying too hard at times) so you might want to bring tissues along. The plot is pretty simple, Laxman aka Tubelight does little but wholesome things to increase his 'yakeen' which he believes will bring his brother back from war. The cinematography is breathtaking, but the war scenes were disappointing and poorly choreographed. The film's music was thoroughly enjoyable, especially Nach Meri Jaan and Radio.The supporting cast was pretty good. The late Om Puri showed us his excellence for one last time, acing the role as Banne Chacha. Sohail Khan played his part well, nothing else to it. Zhu Zhu was great whenever she was great on-screen, so was little Matin Rey Tangu. Zeeshan Ayyub was convincingly good in his role. SRK's cameo was (no pun intended) magical.5/10.",

Not being a regular Salman Khan fan, where I only liked a handful of his movies such as Tere Naam, Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya, I was a bit apprehensive. I watched the movie yesterday and I liked the movie, the songs, the child actor, the story and most importantly Salman's courage to pick up a non-conventional role. I mean I understand it is no Shawshank Redemption and may not be the best Bollywood movie either but it is definitely an above-average, emotional rendering of a man's story who is not a stereotypical hero, set in a time where things were different, filled with positive messages about nationalism, acceptance, war and \"yakeen\"(belief).My suggestion, go watch this with your family. It is a tearjerker and definitely one of Salman's best acting roles after Tere Naam.",

Salman's character is like a child and having problems which he is well aware but he is not concerned about these but all he concerns about is his brother. So Salman acted that way. It is painful to see when Salman is actually giving performance according to his character then all are saying all kind of negative talks. He deserves distinction for his effort. Rest of the casts including Sohail are efficient. The locales and especially soundtrack are just awesome. Radio song and main agar are the best of the lot. There is emotional content in the film that is very much real. Feel of the film is terrific. Sometimes good films become flop and vise- versa. Tubelight expectedly flopped because people in our country don't like good film with entertainment. This film is definitely better than those nawazuddin films.\nBottom line is tubelight is a gem that no one cared about...but as I said I give damn!\nAs the tagline says,'kya tumhe yakeen hai' I would say mujhe yakeen hai k Salman can do good roles besides comedy and action.",

You would certainly find an emotional connect with the acting of Salman khan if you have lost someone close recently. Also I think it was a bold movie for Salman Khan since his fanboys expect him to behave in a very manly (men also cry btw) and strong heroic manner. But in this movie he is showing his emotional side which probably is the way anyone will react in such a situation. All the characters have done proper justice to the role. If you want 2 hrs of emotional drama then this is a good movie with a relatively positive ending. Don't go by other reviews. It is a genuine movie with a pure heart and soul. I was never a salman fan but he has actually given his best. I care more about the effort of the actors and directors.

            "content": "Tubelight (2017): Everyone got surprised when Salman got a disaster in his career after 7 years of consecutive successes.Tubelight,which is a remake of 2015 Hollywood film Little Boy is released amidst huge expectations as it is from Bajrangi Bhaijaan combo.But surprisingly,Tubelight failed in impressing audience.What's the reason? Plot: In a small picturesque town in North India, Laxman (Salman Khan) lives with his younger brother Bharat (Sohail Khan). The two have no other family and are inseparable. Laxman's world comes crashing down, when war breaks out and Bharat gets drafted into the Army. A helpless Bharat leaves a devastated Laxman behind. News from the border only worsens, as the tension continues to escalate. Seeing the carnage around him and worried for his brother, Laxman decides he must stop this conflict and get his brother back.My Review: Salman Khan has come a long way from the days of bare-chested fight sequences and gyrating dance numbers \u2013 a combination that brought him some of his biggest hits and sent legions of his fans into rapture.The change began with 2015's summer mega-hit Bajrangi Bhaijaan, in which the star sought to build bridges between India and Pakistan; it continued through last year's biopic Sultan, where an ageing action man pondered how best to use his muscle.Both the films are very good and considered one of the best performances from Salman Khan.But Tubelight did not.Even if the film's scenes are inspired from Little Boy,Tubelight has Bajrani Bhaijaan vibe to it.Salman Khan's act and his friendship with a kid,all resembles the Bhaijaan.Even though the movie has lot of content to become a emotional film,it is wasted as the film tries to be too melodramatic.There are some things that actor Salman Khan does very well \u2014 like barreling through action scenes, romancing women and dancing to Bollywood songs, with or without a shirt.Delivering a nuanced performance in the role of a developmentally disabled man? Not so much.Playing a mentally challenged character has by now become a rite of passage in Bollywood \u2014 Salman Khan's A-list box office rivals, Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan, have both portrayed characters on the autism spectrum with skill and sensitivity, in My Name Is Khan and Dhoom 3, respectively; while Hrithik Roshan's attempt to play an intellectually disabled character in Koi...Mil Gaya and its sequels but here Salman tries too hard.But his dedication deserves a mention.This film has strong performances from Om Puri,Chinese actress Zhu Zhu and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub and surprising cameo from Shah Rukh Khan.SO,Tubelight may have its good moments but Salman Khan is a miscast as the lead role.My Rating 5//10",

Adding whole lot of songs , extra description , lengthy email conversations etc. At least away from his usual 'beat the bad guys' characters. That's something positive. Yes it surly is.To declare first , I would be a wrong person to considered for telling you about this movie. The reason being I have already Seen 'LITTLE BOY' the movie from which TUBELIGHT has been copied (or officially remade , I don't know exactly) . Which I didn't liked much. So for me , TUBELIGHT is a remake of a Hollywood film which I think was not worth remaking. But they did it. And did it decently. It's better then it's original. But not great.The storyline is very manipulative and convoluting. It's based on the message that \"you can do everything if you have faith\". But the message is given in a wrong way. And by wrong I mean that much wrong that parents would take care of their small children to make them understand that message correctly or they can take itin a wrong way.Emotional moments were not that great as Bajrangi Bhaijaan . Yes I know , that's a high bar to achieve. But TUBELIGHT didn't even came close to it , even after being made by the same team. So I guess that's a valid comparison. When it comes to performance , I don't actually have any complaint with Salmaan. He did an earnest job. But again , when I compare it to Amir Khan (Dhoom3 , Ajay Devgan(Main Aisa Hi Hoon) , Hritik Roshan (Koi Mil Gya) , SRK (My Name Is Khan) playing similar roles , Salmaan fall short. Speaking of SRK , his cameo was really flat or I can say , nothing special with that.Didn't liked the VFX , too many animated scenes were there , easily seen that it's done with computer. Songs were too many. Radio , Tinka Tinka , Kuch Nai , all three stopped the flow. Only , nach Meri Jaan and Main agar add to the flow. I mean again , the length of the movie could have been short , really easy.But yes , it's a passable film. Not bad. Jokes work. Salmaan's performance work . And I really liked two Chinese actors Zhu Zhu and Matin Rey Tangu. They both acted really good.So yes , movie may work for hard core Salmaan fans. Or for those who have enough time for a long movie. Didn't quite worked for me. Check your requirements before watching it.6.4/10 by ANuP APu KuMaR",

            "content": "Salman Khan has been on the verge of great Indian Cinema with movies like Bajrangi Bhaijaan, Sultan, Partner, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, and Wanted. Everything about Salman Khan has been accurate starting from its screenplay to his tremendous acting. So basically this movie is a remake of a Hollywood flick that goes by the name of Little Boy which starred David Henrie and Emily Watson which did become a critical failure. After watching this movie, I felt that a remake wasn't really necessary plus the dramatic factors were exactly the same between the 2 movies.So basically, Laxman Singh Bisht is a Ladakh boy who is very dependent on his brother. He is a man child due to his symptoms but is very loving and respectful. His brother joins the army to fight the Chinese but appears missing which actually shows him being caught by Chinese soldiers which occur during the war. Laxman meets this magician who is played by a special actor who gives him powers where he can shake the ground using his mind. With the help of a child and his mother who get lost during the war, how Laxman gets his brother back is basically what this movie is all about.The teaser was a masterpiece making me realize how excited I was for this film.It breaks my heart to say this but it is a disappointing film. Kabir Khan would've still made this film successful if he produced a much more coherent screenplay. I know how much he loves doing favorable films like risks to get the job done but alright, the 1st half he managed to keep the film overwhelming but the benefit of the doubt lies in the 2nd half where the movie drags for another hour and a half making it boring and less comedic/tear jerking. The acting was consistent but not too great.Salman Khan manages to give a phenomenal performance as Laxman and keeps the film going until the end so that is something that kept me satisfied but the dialogues were rather perky like the \"yakeen\" line when he is asked to believe in himself to find his brother.Sohail Khan was surprisingly good but not too good and does bring back some mentality from his previous washouts like Main aur Mrs Khanna or Miane Pyaar Kyu Kiya.Matin Rey Tangu was adorable but his role doesn't bring any tears just like what Harshaali Malhotra did in Bajrangi Bhaijaan but he was good in term of acting but in some parts of the film.Om Puri's role will be remembered and also remembered as an inspiration to Bollywood.Zhu Zhu was just there and really didn't do much for her role so she was bit effortless and bland.Priam's music is a nightmare except the Radio Song which still plays in my head. He has been making horrible music since Dangal but Raabta had some refreshing tunes but yeah Priam's album is a losing streak.Overall, this movie is undoubtedly one of the most Disappointing movies of 2017 and I though after the teaser, it was something else. Don't waste your end money this weekend and I'd rather buy a Bajrangi Bhaijaan DVD but for Salman Khan's performance, I can partially recommend it for the big screen but later it will be a regret.2.5/5- Box office is the usual 400-500 crores but won't beat Baahubali 2 which is at the top of the game sitting on 1800 crores.Eid Mubarak everyone!!!!!",

Make no mistake the movie is complete drama movie... it wants to based on the character study but it fails somewhere...It is the last film of Om Puri who is great in this movie...The movie is about two brothers... its based on those two brothers relationship which we needed to care about to follow the story and to care about the journey of both brothers... but there relationship is very poorly developed and that fails this condition.. The characters of the village were great.. the relation between Main Character(Salman Khan) and the Chinese kid is great... The dialogues are good in this movie... some dialogues in some scenes gives you some lessons of life type dialogues which is good actually...There is few very Small war sequences which was fantastic...The acting pretty average from every one except Om Puri and Mohd. Zeeshan Ayyub... those two were fantastic in their roles...The songs were not needed.. it should have been 15 min shorter, it felt long... The movie depends on Salman Khan's acting and the the relationship between two brothers... both those fails and the whole movie seems flat.. The screenplay is good but it falters on directing and acting in so many level...Tubelight is a kind of drama movie that no one expected it to go that route.. the plot is good but execution is average... the movie is average... 5.9/10....",

The cinematography was excellent as always, Kabir shows his National Geographic talent here. The plot was predictable and not at all nuanced. A huge emotional element to the movie that would appeal to some. It was not my cup of tea. Honestly it is about time Sallu stopped doing this type of lead roles meant for someone in their early 20s, he looks old and so does Sohail with his prominent double chin. Wonder where Kabir goes next - Sri Lanka or Bangladesh. Please hire some new blood next time.",

And in this, the last nail in the Bollywood coffin, we see a steroid jacked 50 year old playing the part of a mentally disabled man-child, in a movie brazenly copied from an English title. I gave this film 2 stars because despite its limitations as a movie, I can see it being effective as a method of torture. Prisoners in Guantanamo would sooner gouge out their own eyeballs using spoons laced in chili oil, than watch this movie. To that end, it may have its uses yet.",

Salman Khan doesn't jutified the lead character but his performances were not embarrassing, he did quiet good. As example, Ranbir could have been done better. Zhu Zhu's appearances are good. Om Puri and Zeeshan Ayyub performances are awesome. Music by Pritam is so mediocre this time, background score by Julius Packiam is praiseworthy! Slow pace is one of the drawback.

It is an emotional roller coaster of a story. DO NOT listen to people who tell you that it is bad film or that Salman hasn't performed well and so on.It is a simple beautiful story of a child like man who starts 'believing' that his belief can bring back his brother. Salman as 'Lakshman the Tubelight' is spot on with his performance. Wonderfully supported by Late Om Puri ji, little child actor from Arunachal Pradesh, Matin Rey Tangu is a delight to watch. His mother played by beautiful Zhu Zhu is amazing too, although they messed up with her dubbing. Sohail Khan has tried very well too and the couple of scenes he had, he is very efficient an effective.Superbly, beautifully shot by Aseem Mishra, Tubelight is film that relies of Salman Khan's emotions which I personally feel he has managed to communicate perfectly and very sweetly with his performance. I heard, read somewhere that this is his 'worst performance', I totally disagree. On surface level it might seem a bit silly but when you watch the film you feel the conviction with which it has been delivered.This film is a very relevant for India right now. It touches on many social issues and debates that we all need to think about.Racism against minorities, Patriotism, Empathy for Disabled people, the language wars, Alcoholism, Spirituality, pain and loss of loved ones, martyrdoms of our soldiers, it is an amazing film. One of the best aspect of the film is how the 1962 war with China is depicted. Wonderfully shot and directed, the battle scenes are very, very believable. Another aspect of the film that I really loved is that the film did not bash Chinese. Even Chinese soldiers are talked about with respect as India soldiers, except by a couple of characters who are really angry with China but who also by end have change of hearts of sorts.One of the most important reason that you should watch this film is Om Puri ji This is his last performance and it is wonderful as ever. He was as natural and a delight to watch as ever! Propagating the messages of Gandhi ji, his character and look is perfect and looks the part.The main message of the film is to have 'Self Belief'. With it one literally move mountains!Highly moving, highly emotional, highly fun and entertaining and highly satisfying, this is a must watch!Hats off to Kabir Khan for making such a lovely film.My ratings:: 8/10 (Deducting 2 for bad CGI at couple of places!)",

            "content": "Its a good watch, an entertainer I must say ! As always Kabir Khan tried to convey a novel message thru the movie. There are many good aspects in the movie, however, unfortunately you can see the flaws clearly as well. Locations, themes, actors and characters are excellent. But again, its a little too much of Salman, mixed up between being a weak , innocent and child like brother. Most likely- the message was to say he is a special child with great will power ! The relationship between Salman and the child was honest and very well depicted. How ever it was too much mockery to keep addressing the name as Goo thru out the movie, when clearly the name is Guo. Some of the Indian names are often made fun of in many sitcoms, to an extent the fun part here is also understandable as the broader message is clearly on being united. Overall it felt like I read an average book with awesome visions and imaginations of the era picked up for the movie. What made it not so good is the melodramatic and mixed up ending, clearly looked like an attempt to cater to Indian crowd who actually expect perfect and happy ending ! Its good to see Salman evolve as an actor. He did get naturally teary in the movie, specially given that \"Bhai chara\" is something he connects with all his heart! BTW with both the brothers their age and maturity shows up, although was not very uprightly deterrent in the movie. I would look forward to seeing Salman mature further and bring in more gender dominance in the movies :)! His charm, Kabir's touch of moral messages and true events and more dominant diversity will be a great deal to watch for ! Good way to say goodbye to Mr Ompuri - one of the legendary actors in Indian cinema.",

The easiest way to gain sympathy is by showing the protagonist as a non matured kid, innocent and childlike. We have had a long history of that in bollywood, gain sympathy by showing some rare disease (pa, guzarish, barfi) or show non realistic themes.Locations and cinematography is wonderful, so is the other cast. Om puri and the little child. Rest it just feels like a safe bet by kabir khan, put a goody goody world and ppl will grab it.Of course one can't argue with salman fans as they get personal in case anyone criticises the movie.

            "content": "Tubelight is about a man with the strange nickname who loves his brother dearly and when his brother joins the army during the conflict between the Indians and the Chinese during the 1960s, he looks to the teachings of Gundi to create a miracle to get his brother to come home, that miracle comes in the form of two Indians of Chinese decent who move into the village.Salman Khan plays Tubelight in this one. When I think of Salman Khan, I'm always thinking Bollywood's answer to Sylvester Stallone, I don't know why Stallone particularly, but that's what I'm thinking. In a lot of ways it makes sense because Stallone has done some strange so-so dramas in his career, and this is Khan's. I went in expecting a lot more action and adventure, but as it turns out this is more of a drama. It's an OK one, I'm not disappointed really, but I will say that Tubelight has nothing on the last Kahn movie I saw, Sultan, which was a pretty great drama.It's a very neutral film, allowing it to appeal to the massive audience, with a simple story on tolerance. How very interesting to see a movie on tolerance from a different culture. India was at war with China during the 60s, and at the rate that China was taking out the Indian army (according to the movie) it's understandable why Tubelight's small village was unkind to anyone with a Chinese face. Despite being a movie set in a different time in a different land the message it hits upon is very current for an American Audience (or anyone who judges a book by it's cover) Not that big a fan of musicals. Some of the Bollywood songs in this film are alright, but a lot of them feel like they were written by Disney composers, which I guess really sticks with the massive appeal of the film.So overall, I was hoping for an action film but still Salman Kahn delivered a movie that was not all that bad I guess.Oh, and rest in peace Om Puri who the movie was dedicated to. Whenever I watch these Bollywood films he was a face that I recognized more than Khan's, so it's sad that I will not see that face again.",

They cant be run by these stupid actors making flop remakes and giving terrible performances. Many good films are not brought into spotlight because of this stupid film release on Eid.

But after watching the film I had a change in my opinion. It was really entertaining. Now saying about the movie, it is about Lakshman (Salman) whose brother is his life. But when his brother is selected for the war, he is shattered. But his hope and faith keep him waiting. That's the storyline. Some said it was overly melodramatic. But I think the statement is wrong. There was a good amount of drama woven into the narrative but never loses it's grip. The other thing to applaud is its camera work and background score. Those sections were neatly done. But there are also negatives in the movie. The film sometimes moves in a slow mode. And also the climax need not be long drawn. Now coming to the performances, Salman proves yet again he can carry a film on his shoulders. Sohail Khan has also done a wonderful job even though he had less role. Also the supporting cast which includes Zhu Zhu, Martin Rey Tangu, Isha Talwar, Om puri and Mohammed Zeeshan Aayub has also done their roles neatly. So overall this movie can be considered a clean family entertainer and will be a bang for your buck. My rating: 3.5/5",

            "content": "Based in Kumaon, the film is an official adaptation of Little Boy, but it is nowhere close to the original one.Set in 1962, the worst part of the film is its weak plot and sloppy execution. Tubelight is by far Kabir Khan's weakest film. Though the entire film is about brotherly bond, it hardly touches you. The film has uncountable glitches which makes it an absolute mess. While Bajrangi Bhaijaan is a film, which makes me sit in front of the television even today, Tubelight hardly strikes a chord. It fails to enlighten nor manages to get rid of the gloomy darkness in the world of entertainment. You can definitely skip this one and instead watch Kabul Express, Bajrangi Bhaijaan at home.My Rating : 2/5",

            "content": "Normally I would start out my review by saying the film name and name of the director. But I am ashamed to associate Kabir Khan's name with this film even. I saw the trailer of the film and I knew that \"OK. It may not be Bajrangi Bhaijaan but let's give it a chance\". In short, I had not kept high expectations with this film. But I was utterly shattered after the film finished.Plot: Laxman tries every possible thing to bring his brother Bharat back when he gone for war.Story and Direction: Let's actually summarize as to what Kabir Khan has done till now: 1) Kabul Express - A film set in Afghanistan about 4 people. 2) New York - About 4 Muslim people in New York City. 3) Ek Tha Tiger - A love story between a RAW Agent and ISI Agent 4) Bajrangi Bhaijaan - A man's struggle to send a kid back to Pakistan 5) Phantom - A story about an ex army man to take revenge on those people responsible for 26/11.A common factor noticed in all these films - Muslims. Kabir Khan has used this angle in many stories of his in one way or another. Not that I have a problem with this. I guess he has used this angle very nicely in his films. Kabir Khan must have thought \"Enough with the Muslim thing. People will think that I have nothing else to show. Let me use the Chinese.\" This film was a mistake from the very beginning. This film is just nothing. I don't expect things like this from Kabir Khan (Yes, I am saying that this is worse than Phantom). The first 20-25 mins were good. I even teared up a bit. The very first scene where the village is shown on top of a mountain was hilarious. But after that it was just s***. The second half even sinks further. There were so many implausible things done in this half that made me think \"What the hell Kabir. You are better than This\". The entire Chinese people subplot was useless. It had no base. And the Climax. O My God, So much clich\u00e9d. I started to actually laugh there. And I am beginning to hate the word \"yakeen\" (meaning: Belief). The number of times this word was said was unimaginable. And the things done with this \"yakeen\". O My God, it sucks. Kabir tried to replicate several things from Bajrangi like the way Salman introduces himself and the way the end credits come. I guess he hadn't come out of the BB fever. I saw some people getting out of the hall even before the film finished. And that is never good. One thing though the photography was very good. And the locations too. Performances: Salman Khan made the biggest mistake of his career signing this film. I always say that he is not a great actor but an excellent entertainer. This film showed his deficiency in the acting department. He cannot cry!!!! Sohail Khan sucked in every scene he appeared (especially in the climax). Om Puri's role made me realize that why he is of a great loss to the industry. Zeeshan Ayyubn was also a great addition. Matin Rey Tangu and Zhu Zhu were also good in their emotions. SRK made that 10 minute cameo something to watch for.Music: Pritam again has done wonders with the music of this film. I can't fault even a song of this film. Radio and Naach Meri Jaan were easily my favorites. KK's song (Main Agar) at the end was the icing on the cake.Favorite Scene: Easily it is the SRK cameo. The charisma of SRK never dies, even in a cameo.Worst Scene: Very easy. The climax. So clich\u00e9d and so bad acting. O My God.Verdict: The film is easily the worst of Kabir Khan (out of all his films) and Salman Khan (of recent times). The film as I said was a mistake from the very beginning (The source material itself has a 22% rating on Rotten Tomatoes). I being a big Salman Khan fan myself advise anyone not to go watch this film. It is full of s*** and absurdity. Even the music couldn't save this film.I am going to go with a 4/10.",

Well, that's like Forrest Gump who is going through an identity crisis, and instead of people saying 'Run Forrest Run\u0085', this one has 'Jal Ja.. Jal ja\u0085tubelight\u0085 jal ja\u0085'After the first act, the film starts echoing with the whole theme of Yakeen ki taqat (Faith can move mountains) which instead of inspiring, might end up depressing the viewer by the end of the film. However, the picturesque location and amazing cinematography and background score will keep you glued to the seat. This is the whole issue about the movie. While writing Tubelight Movie Review, I am really not going to give away what is in it, because if you leave out the Chinese family, the film will still be alive, because they are just there.

Salman has a lot to do to improve his acting skills as I felt it was overacting in this whole movie and none of the rest caught my attention. All the songs in this movie were senseless. I felt this movie was struggling with the ending as the director did not know if he had to end it on a good or bad note.

No doubt he tries hard, but its not his genre and we as audience know what he is capable of. There are only a few actors who prove us wrong and take us by surprise with their acts. Unfortunately Salman Khan is not one of them. However, Kabir Khan did take us by surprise because we expected some top kind of film from him, but he disappointed us.

            "content": "It is a period film draws back the time of 1962, the time of Sino- Indian war. Its a story of two brother and one among them is Laxman Singh Bisht(Salman Khan), a slow-witted person, who grows up under the protection of his lovable and caring younger brother Bharat Singh Bisht (Sohail Khan) in a small town Jagatpur in Kumaon. While others always tease Laxman and bully him and call him Tubelight while Bharat shuts them up and protect his brother always and call him Captain. When Indo-China war broke out, Bharat and other youngsters from the town join the Indian Army and go to the front for battle. Laxman also tries to join Army but fails the physical test and as such stays back home. Due to Bharat's joining Indian Army, Laxman is left all alone, and its very difficult for him to sustain as he is very innocent and not able to protect himself. An Indian woman of Chinese origin Lee Ling (Zhu Zhu) comes from Calcutta to stay in the same town with her little son Guwo (Matin Ray Tangu). While being Chinese, Laxman hates them at first, but he is forced to follow the Gandhian principle of befriending enemy by Banne Chacha (Om Puri). Accordingly, Lee and Guwo turn Laxman's only friends in a place where all others were mostly teasing or unkind in their approach towards him. Laxman kept inquiring from the army chief posted in their city about the where about and well being of Bharat to which he doesn't get the suitable reply. Banne Chacha tells him that faith can even move mountains, which Laxman being innocent, takes seriously and tries to do that. Moreover, Laxman also kept believing that his brother, who has been captured by Chinese Army, will return from the battle front and declares that he will get Bharat back with his 'YAKEEN'. ANALYSIS: The concept of the movie is good in today's time when every now and then there is a demand for nationality certificate by one way or other but with minor changes in Little Boy, Tubelight doen't inspires us and script looks weak and doesn't look like a movie type. I didn't get what filmmaker want to prove when Laxman tried to move the mountain with his faith, doesn't it sounds stupid in real life. I mean there are countless ways to teach the power of faith. Moreover, there is now comparison between Kabir Khan's Bajrangi Bhaijaan & this one. There many unnecessary characters in the movie. The movie also fails to make an emotional connect with audiences unlike Bajrangi Bhaijaan. Some scenes are hilarious such as Laxman's calling Guwoo and Goo through the film, or his apologizing to the temple priest, his schoolmaster and an elderly woman for his mischieves committed in childhood. But overall Salman fails to enact or sometimes overact innocent Laxman. Movie also seems stretched specially in the second half and also climax is predictable. Salman's act in the last scene to bring Bharat to sense, reminded me of Kamal Haasan's act in Sadma to make Sridevi recognize him. One more thing is indigestible that how such bulky one like Bharat (Sohail Khan) is able to join army, he must have done some hard work to curtail his belly to perform this role. Music is also not that good and some songs were unnecessary in the film. WHAT'S GOOD: Some songs, Salman's act in the last scene, beautiful camera-work and Shahrukh's cameo. NOT GOOD: Weak script, mixed performances, predictable climax and lack of emotional connect. STAR PERFORMANCES: This one is not the best performance of Salman Khan. Good chemistry with his buddy Sohail and the last scene of the movie is also beautifully performed. Sohail Khan has a very average performance with literally no expression. Chinese actress Zhu Zhu and child actor Matin Ray Tangu played their part with perfection as much as role they have. Late Om Puri also delivers a good performance. FINAL WORDS: Unlike its name Tubelight flickers but fails to shine and as such, fails to make an impact. MAJA NAHI AAYAA YAAR..... My ratings for this movie is 1 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "Eid feels incomplete without a Salman Khan movie. Over the last few years he has ruled the box office and fans' hearts with his larger than life persona. He reunites once again with Kabir Khan after Ek Tha Tiger and Bajrangi Bhaijaan. Naturally, the expectations from the duo were massive. The result, however, is a film that never quite takes off. For me this was the biggest disappointment of the year so far because I expect a lot from my Eid releases and they almost always deliver. Tubelight will stand as the exception. I hope.Tubelight is a tale of two brothers caught in the Indo-China war in 1962. Laxman, played by Salman Khan, is an innocent man whose mind never fully develops in the traditional sense. This has caused him a lot of sorrow growing up but his spirit is still intact. His partner on this journey is his always supportive younger brother Bharat (Sohail Khan). When Bharat joins the army and is considered MIA, Laxman's belief in the power of hope and faith is put to the ultimate test. Based on the movie 'The Little Boy' this is an interesting story that tries hard to make you care but the film's slow as molasses pace bores you more than it moves you.The fault in this production is entirely the writers. The movie runs for over 2 hours but there are only a handful of memorable moments. The bond between the brothers is sweet and a few of the schemes that Laxman comes up with to bring his brother back are entertaining but everything in the middle is painfully dull. Kabir Khan as writer and director disappointed me more than I thought possible. I sighed often and wished the man behind Bajrangi Bhaijaan would come back. What happened, Mr. Khan? Why the complacency?Another thing that didn't completely work for me was Salman Khan's portrayal of Laxman. Naive and childlike isn't his forte and that's quite apparent here. Fierce, humane, and even innocent are characteristics he can easily embody but there are clear limits. Mind you, there are a few scenes he handles marvelously but overall the impact was missing. Sohail Khan is surprisingly genuine and the much talked about debut by Chinese actress Zhu Zhu is decent. The brightest sparkle in the sea of actors is the late Om Puri who wonderfully portrays the brothers' makeshift uncle and town elder. Farewell Mr. Puri, Indian cinema will miss you.The film's locales are gorgeous and the mounting is impressive but the lame script spoils the mood. Throwing a cute kid into the mix doesn't make up for a weak screenplay. Tubelight is the kind of movie that shoves emotions down your throat and forces you to care. This does cause your eyes to get wet but you gain very little satisfaction from the experience. I was left bored and annoyed. Don't test your viewer's patience, Mr. Khan. We know you're capable of much better things. And that goes for you too, Mr. Khan.https://stuffiwatchblog.wordpress.com/2017/06/26/tubelight/",

Acting- lets be honest, Salman khan cant act, neither sohail khan, and third brother too. Some critics are saying that this movie shows how worst salman can act, then i must say that these guys haven't seen mr khans movies at all. This was last movie of late om puri, he is decent as always. Direction- according to previous work of kabir khan you cant expect any thing new from him. And this movie is example of that. He is always been average. Music- its typical salman khan kabir khan music, so just avoid. Afterall i really feel like IMDb should introduce minus number in rating column.",

SUMMARY: Laxman Singh Bisht (Salman Khan) a good-hearted person, keeps faith in himself that his brother Bharat Singh Bisht (Sohail Khan) will return alive from the 1962 Sino-Indian war. Will Laxman's faith bring his brother back alive?2. STORY, SCREENPLAY AND DIALOGUES: Story and Screenplay penned by Kabir and Khan and co-written by Parveez Shaika is pathetic. The audience fails to digest such a script, however the dialogues in the this film are good.3. PERFORMANCES: Salman Khan's performance is worth a watch. The rest of the cast has also done a good job.4. DIRECTION AND OTHER TECHNICAL ASPECTS: After a few huge hits Kabir Khan has directed a torture due to the films weak narrative style. Songs by Pritam are good whereas Background Score by Julius Packiam wasn't as good as the songs. Cinematography by Aseem Mishra and Editing by Rameshwar S. Bhagat had to be improvised.5. BOX OFFICE VERDICT: Made on a budget of 100 crore this film can gross around 130-150 crore nett at the box office due to it's negative WOM. Overall Kabir Khan could make a Blockbuster but has ended up making just a Hit, that too only because of Salman Khan's star power, i.e. the film will gross above 100 crore only because of Salman Khan's star power.6. RATING: Beacuase of the film's horrible script I'll give it 0.5/4.",

The story, albeit a bit stretched, is quite an emotional one. All performances are pretty good, except Salman Khan's one, who is sometimes exceptional, sometimes ridiculously bad. Music is fine, it matches the movie well and only appears at key moments. My point is, it's far from a perfect movie; it's a good movie nonetheless. I'm honestly shocked this is rated so low, and even more flabbergasted that the borefest of a movie Prem Ratan Dhan Payo is rated higher. Overrall, somewhere between 6.5 and 7.5; it's a lesser version of Bajrangi Bhaijaan (which they struck gold with). It's worth your time and money.",

The second thing that movie showed was 1962 Sino-Indian War. Diverse actors like Zhu Zhu and Matin Rey Tangu were also starred. And Om Puri once again won my heart. Om Puri, Amrish Puri and Javed Sheikh-you cannot underestimate them at all. They are the best. Salman Khan's acting seemed bit off though. There were amazing songs by Atif Aslam , Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, British singer Kamaal Khan and Javed Ali in the movie that made the movie more zesty. The moral was about Believe. Believing has the ability to change the fate and the world. And inner strength to endure such courage could give you loads of miracles in life. Shahrukh Khan was also featured in one scene, who was shown as a magician, who initiated the asset of believing in yourself to Laxman(Salman Khan). Salman Khan as Laxman is an innocent character and boneheaded while his younger brother Bharat is brave and intelligent. Gandhi's school of thoughts are also presented in the movie, and how he has shown peace and kept intact with the principle of Satyagraha. The character of Gandhi was also shown in mini scenes along with that Om Puri's character was shown to firmly believe in Gandhism and he was the one who taught this to Laxman.",

The plot is so weak too, I watched a little boy and that little boy is truly a little boy which makes sense that he is very close to father and wants him back as a child perspective a realistic stuff, which here is not even near to your imagination.I think a fool also cannot enjoy this film. Salman is lucky enough to get good work but this script is so bad that I can say it now Salman is not a cinematic/understand good cinema/understand the story at all. I like him as a human being but here he lost me from now on I will never book a ticket without reading other reviews.Kabir's screenplay same based on a little boy which was far better this, other actors were okay no extraordinary work.

            "content": "Director Initially tried to give justification to the title of the movie \"Tubelight\" but it couldn't help him to make a great story. Tubelight mainly lacks of script, it's like a body without a soul.The Movie doesn't have any great dialogues and screenplay. Background Score of the movie is good, but it had been covered up the screenplay, so BGM doesn't make any sense.War Scenes have created a Curiosity but didn't help the audience stick back to their seats. Music is Average.Salman tries to give his best, but couldn't create the magic like Bhajrangi Bhaijan. Mukesh Chabra have also been failed in casting the right people for the movie. Characters of Om Puri, Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub are not up to the mark. Zhu Zhu tried to do her best but yet failed to impress the audience. SRK Cameo also wouldn't the movie.Not but not the least Martin Rey's performance was the only thing which held the movie.Positives:- War Scenes, Martin Rey Tangu Performance.Negatives:- Story, Screenplay, Dialouges, CGI Work",

A standout performance was given by Martin and Zhu; the two Chinese actors that almost had me convinced they could speak Hindi.Cinematography and soundtrack are excellent however the plot and pacing leaves a lot to be desired. The long runtime means it's best watched over two sittings rather than one.The subject matter covered in this film spans a bloody time in history between two nations that are still at each other's throats and tubelight illuminates a path forward for both countries; not with dazzling brightness but a glimmer of hope.",

            "content": "Salman Khan and Kabir Khan team tried so hard to create a emotional movie and somehow they succeeded, but to be honest after 30 minutes I was really irritated by their emotional concept throughout the movie. I mean they had 2 hrs and 16 minutes and in this long duration they only shows us melodrama which appears really fake.Lets take a brief look on the movie:*Story/Plot - 1/10I really feel sad to give such low reviews for story but what to do if makers make a movie only with a concept. Honestly their is no story in this movie, it has a concept which includes long and boring melodrama scenes, some not so hilarious comedy, pointless characters and irritating dubbing of Chinese character played by \"Zhu Zhu\"(by the way she is beautiful).*Cast/Acting - 2/10I always admires his character in Bajrangi Bhaijaan,Tere Naam and Baghban but in this movie his acting is too much annoying! I can't deny the fact that he is the Superstar of Indian Movie Industry but when I was watching this movie I really asked to myself that what the hell he is doing in this industry! Anywayas we all expect Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, Yashpal Sharma and Om Puri played their role nicely and performance of Sohail Khan was also okay. And what can I say about Zhu Zhu and Matin Rey Tangu, I am still searching on google and Wikipedia about their role in this movie. Why they are in this movie is a mystery!*Direction/Cinematography - 3/10Cinematography is very good, the visuals and the smart work of camera will make you fall in love with the locations but in other hand weak direction makes it boring. Director stretched the movie with no point, no plot and just sucked my brain, time and money.*Music/Background Score - 5/10When we talk about a Bollywood movie then it become important to consider Music of the movie. Soundtrack of this movie are good and very soulful except two tracks \"Naach Meri Jaan\" and \"Radio\". But sill songs like \"Main agar\" and \"Tinka Tinka Dil Mera\" in the voice of Atif and Rahat Fateh Ali Khan are enough to make us happy. Background Score is Average, not something that can gain attention.***OVERALL REVIEW***[ 2.75/10 ]Have a nice day. :)",

One thing that I thought was funny was the presence of the Chinese family (excluding the father) during the brother's reunion, and we can all associate their presence with the whole idea of using the child's reaction to enforce the emotional reaction from the audience, THEY were supposed to take Guo's grand father to the hospital in Calcutta due to his injuries. However they left him mid way when they picked up the major on their way to Calcutta. Overall an average movie that tries to play off of Salman's previous hit 'Bajrangi'.
