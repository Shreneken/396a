Colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. But above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most American blockbusters.",

            "content": "Baahubali 2 (2017) continues the epic silliness of the first Baahubali (2015), with even bigger battles, dance scenes, menacing looks, and muscles. The surprise reveal at the end of part 1 is explained and the circle is completed with the transition of the hero role from Amarendra Baahubali himself to his son, Mahendra Baahubali (both played by Prabhas) (who, as an infant, was saved from his murderous uncle by the queen, as seen in the prologue to the first film). Like its antecedent, this film swings wildly from almost slapstick comedy (e.g. Baahubali passes himself of as a 'blockhead' to get near Princess Devasena) to bloody (if cartoonish) violence including multiple impalements, immolations, and decapitations. The buzz-saw chariot is back (now equipped with a sort of volley-gun arrow launcher) but the tactical highlight is the palm-tree catapults that launch teams of soldiers who to use their shields to form armored balls in mid-air. Even Wile E Coyote would have dismissed this strategy as improbable, but the laws of physics are outrageously ignored throughout most of the action scenes and this is just a particularly egregious (but fun) example. Not surprisingly, most of the film is CGI: very good in places but times looking more like a video-game than an epic, 'live-action' film. As with #1, I watched a subtitled version so can't really comment on the acting but all of the leads still look and sound the part (Anushka Shetty's Devasena and Sathyaraj's Kattappa are particularly good). There were a few weak scenes (the weird flying ship (dream?) sequence comes to mind) that IMO kept #2 from being as overall as good as #1; but, all in all, an over-the-top epic fantasy with perhaps a somewhat different aesthetic than Western audiences are used to (picture Aragorn and Arwen, backed by dancing elves, breaking into a love duet in the middle of the council of Elrond).",

There're plenty of crazy action sequences as bahubali jumps from one bull to another, these things can make u laugh( climax wall jump too). there are plenty to dramatic, emotionally impactful, goosebumps inducing moments that will keep u there. That final fight between the two is well choreographed, shot and the CONCLUSION is satisfying!",

            "content": "So finally we get to see why Katappa killed baahubali. This was the question that was on everyone's tongue. Baahubali 2 answers the question but it may or may not satisfy you. In fact, there are many twists in this film. Baahubali: The Beginning was a good experience. It was a milestone in terms of VFX. The story line though clich\u00e9d was good, the background score was powerful and the cinematography was beautiful. Baahubali 2 is more of what you saw in Baahubali but it fades in comparison. Yes, the fight scenes are on a larger scale than the first one. You may have guessed that from the trailer. Yes, there is a fight scene that we all have been waiting to see. Yes, there are some scenes that would give you an adrenaline rush but in the midst of all this chaos, you feel that something is not right. Something is missing and you don't know what it is. Baahubali: The Beginning was the first film that made us believe that we were able to produce such films. That film single-handedly intrigued us and maybe that is the reason Baahubali 2 does not feel like an original work anymore. It feels like a copy paste of the original without any soul. The screenwriters try to make it work by giving us back stories but some part of it does not fit.Acting performances are okay with most of the good performances coming from prabhas, duggubati and Anushka. Some of the actors are over the top just like the first film.It is also longer than Baahubali which is a treat for the fans. I mean, they deserve it, after all, they have been waiting for two years to see it on the big screen. To the serious movie-goers though, it is a big let down since most of the film could have been edited to make it shorter and to-the-point. Most of the time is wasted on the same things that were the problems with Baahubali - the unnecessary romance and songs. I know, we Indians are used to watching songs but for god's sake, stop doing it. songs do not add any value to the story and they are cringe-worthy. You are making a film that is supposed to be compared with Hollywood's behemoths and then you add a dance sequence to it? That's utterly stupid. It seems to me that this film didn't really need a sequel (but everyone wanted to know why Katappa killed Baahubali). It could have worked as a single film without all the dance and romance. In the end, I would like to say that Baahubali 2 is what fans have been waiting for. They will definitely be happy with the package. It's nothing exceptional though and so some moviegoers might be disappointed. But no matter how well the film is made or how many shortcomings it has, I would still request you to go and watch this film. You need to support it because if it isn't a hit, no one in future will think about taking risks and we'll have to watch the same old Bollywood films for the rest of our lives. Can you tolerate another Happy New Year or Hamshakals?",

            "review_title": "A mediocre product made by mediocre artists .....",
            "content": "I watched this only because my wife insisted that I accompany her. Having hated part 1, I thought I would calm myself down with a few beers before embarking on what would be an assault on everything that I considered to be important for a film to be considered a classic. Alas, I live in the pious state of Kerala where alcohol is partially prohibited and hence I was unable to procure any alcohol on the particular day. I braced myself for what would almost certainly be a torturous experience.I was treated to mediocre special effects and over the top action scenes which even a little boy would find hard to take seriously. The actor Prabhas was insufferable - his face expressions were grotesque. He phones it in most of the time. Anushka Shetty was very pretty but her performance during the action scenes made me chuckle. Another reviewer compared the chariot scene to the famous chariot racing sequence in Benhur. But I was reminded of the chariot chase sequence in Mervyn LeRoy's Quo Vadis. The film did feature some grand vistas and sets like the elephant statue that is carved out of the rock but still attached to the rocky mountain. This is when Prabhas and Anushka first arrive in Magarmazhi on a boat. The Kali statue with fire burning out of various parts when Dagubatti and Nasser are plotting Prabhas' murder was also remarkable. Dagubatti's coronation scene had a lot of potential. All these things indicated to me that at least some people with imagination were working behind the scenes. But everything about the film is shoddy and Rajamouli the director must take the blame for the shoddiness. Once again, the Indian public has elevated a mediocre product made by a bunch of mediocre artists into a worldwide blockbuster that has now grossed 1,500 crores. Some may think that this is a great achievement. But it is not. We as a nation are promoting and spreading mediocrity.",

            "review_title": "Why so much hatred ? Watch before posting review !",
            "content": "Why so much hatred on this movie. I wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1-star ratings. I'm surprised not even single point they liked in this movie. This means when you keep negativity in mind everything looks negative. The sheer collections of this movie in India alone prove how much this movie liked by common movie lover. People who are saying this movie collections are just because of the hype should remember no movie in the world wins the box office just through the hype or publicity. The hype is good for the first day or weekend collections, but once the movie is out only the content wins at the box office. In fact, many times too much hype damages collections if the movie is not up to the mark. I can give you few examples. The Indian superstar Rajinikanth's movie Kabali hyped so high than any movie in India before and not even Baahubali 1 had that much hype. That hype helped to get unimaginable records on the first day and the first weekend, however, the content of the movie is not justifiable over the hype so it just collapsed at the box office. There are plenty of examples like this; another example is South Indian director Shankar's film 'I'. Where Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger came to India to attend the audio function and that created so much buzz. But everyone knows what the result of that movie at the end. Therefore the point is just with hype and publicity no one can make movie run in long run. Also no director in the world can make a movie which satisfies all audiences. Not even James Cameron. When his latest movie Avatar got released there were plenty of people who did not like the movie(IMDb rating 7.8). People questioned what is there in that movie other than spectacle VFX. That is not James Cameron best works compare to his previous movies Titanic, Terminator 2 etc. However, the majority of the people around the world embraced that movie and made it the biggest blockbuster ever in Hollywood film industry. When you are rating this movie keep your negativity aside and watch again, think for a second why Baahubali 2 is able to achieve mind-boggling collections and able to run successfully for 50 days in 1050 centers. If there is nothing in this movie how it would collect that much. Think hard! You will realize the greatness of this movie. If you still not satisfied at least appreciate people's hard work that put their heart and soul in this movie for 5 years. Finally, my review of this movie is as follows.It is most engaging, gripping, jaw-dropping movie that I've seen in recent times. I bet you will get Goosebumps while watching some of the scenes (guaranteed). I've known Rajamouli since his first movie. His biggest strength is his screenplay and emotional drama. He told in many interviews what is his success mantra. 1. Elevation scenes: He ensures there is at least one peak/elevation scene in every ten or 15 minutes of the movie even story won't allow for such scenes. IMO this is one of the reasons he takes more time to make movies as to conceive each such scene is not an easy job. This will keep you engaged throughout the movie without any dull movement. If you think the movie as a two-dimensional graph, his movies are like a sine wave except there are no negative values, only positive values occasionally rise to the peak. Keep this point in mind and watch Baahubali 1 and 2. There is always one or two elevation scene(s) in every 10 or 15 minutes. Especially in Baahubali 2, you forget to take the breath! The screenplay is so tight and engaging.2. Emotional drama: He is a true master in emotional drama. The scenes that lead to Kattapa killing Baahubali are an emotional roller coaster. The drama between each of the lead characters is top notch.3. The villain character: Almost in all his movies villain character is more dominant, powerful, charming, intelligent than a hero. He creates more scenes to establish villain. The point here is, the impact that this build-up creates when hero defeats indisputable villain is terrific. Even in Baahubali 2, the villain character is so powerful sometimes you feel it is impossible to defeat him. Overall it's an eye feast to watch this movie. If possible watch it in IMAX or 4K screen. Thanks to Rajamouli for giving such a wonderful masterpiece.",

            "content": "Its again visually breathtaking but creatively, even difficult to find it average. They project, a would have to be crowned prince has suggested by his beloved Raj Mata to visit the kingdom in disguise so he can understand public problems but you do know it is just so he can find his lady love. Prince falls in love with first glance as expected, together they fight against goons and finally she takes him along!! After few scenes, they fall in love with each other. Raj Mata sends proposal of marriage of her another son with that Princess, which is get assumed by female side that it is for staying Price's marriage proposal. I didn't find anything exciting in all this, which consumes more than one hour of first half of film. Its very oblivious screenplay so I don't mind to writing about it here. Then second half is full of action with the help of VFX. Even the million dollar question which was tossed in first part, answer is just worth few thousand bucks. You feel that even they were so anxious to conceive any brilliant answer which could have matched the hype created but finally came with the answer just for sake of it. There is a small conspiracy for shock value in pre climax but you know that what is going to be happen. Climax fight is so long, offering nothing new. Even at a point it reminds strongly of Robot's climax. Background in climax, with some mantras chanting in lunatic way at different pitch, is not exciting but sheer headache, at least for me it actually happened. It hammered ruthlessly my eardrums. Performance wise all are average and undoubtedly loud.",

I wish I could get my money back. It does not take large copious amounts of money and VFX to make a good movie, but rather, the script, editing, direction and acting should be it's strong points. This movie falls flat in all of these.The director treats his entire movie audience as fools by bending the laws of physics as per his whims and fancies and putting in elaborate nonsensical, visualizations and stunts, as and when he desires. It probably, would all have made sense, if the Bahubalis and their army, were mutants or part of the Avengers team. Otherwise, it's only laughable. Some folks, told me to appreciate, \"the effort with which the movie was made and it's grand visuals\". Well, you just cannot appreciate the effort put into this movie, for despite all it's lavishness, it's a bad movie with a clich\u00e9d plot line; Which is a shame, as it had potential to be so much more.",

            "review_title": "An Epic Conclusion To The Celebrated War Drama",
            "content": "'Baahubali - The Beginning' released back in 2015 was a 'Pan-Indian Blockbuster' that raised the standards of technical brilliance of Indian films with stellar war sequences and awe-inspiring art- direction ,making its Bollywood counter- parts a run for their money.To make a sequel (techncially speaking a prequel) that matches the grandeur and brilliance of the magnum opus 'Baahubali' might look irrealizable,but not for a master craftsman like S.S.Rajamouli who has come up with a stunning piece of cinema that lives upto the hype in all means and even outshines the original as far as the depth of the story-line and a smooth narrative is concerned.The well-made sequel is without doubt a better movie altogether with a thoroughly convincing and hearty story- line that engages the viewers by inviting them to be a part of the Mahishmati kingdom for its run time of 168 minutes.A more befitting finale to this epic is doubtful and the first half by itself makes it a paisa- vasool affair for the normal movie going audience.The love-track between Tammana and Prabhas was a let-back in the first part and the best a thing about the conclusion is that it takes care of leaving aside such avoidable sub plots and tries to concentrate in the inner conflicts and emotions of the lead characters making it a hearty affair for the viewers.The first half of the movie was first-rate in this matter and more entertaining on comparison with nevertheless a very good second half.The way K. V. Vijayendra Prasad handled the answer to the million dollar question \"Why Kattappa Killed Baahubali?\" was brilliant and the overflow of emotions surrounding that question was a delight to watch and made remarkable by brilliant lead performances.The courtroom sequences and the particular arrow fight sequence were exceptional and the highlight of the narrative.A notable lame-point of the movie was the patchy graphics in few sequences which is too sub-standard considering the mammoth budget of the presentation.The climax portions were good,but not as riveting as the rest of the narrative.The audience response was enormous for critical sequences and the cheers and whistles ensure that the movie is going to make it big with its impressive 'WOM' among the families and the youth alike.The absence of a breath-taking war sequence like the 'Kalaleya fight' in the first part didn't make any impact,thanks to the brilliant penning of story-line by K.V.Vijayendra Prasad.Prabhas gave a convincing performance as both Amarendra Bahubali and Mahendra Baahubali with required zeal and intensity that the characters demanded.Anushka was a delight to watch and stamped her authority as a lady action superstar in Indian cinema.Remya Krishnan's act was powerful.Rana Daggubati was good and gave a better performance on comparison with his act in the first.Nasser played his part well.Sathyaraj was lovable and excelled in both comic and emotional sequences.Songs and background score by M.M.Keeravani were effective and elevated the atmosphere of the narration.All the songs qualify for repeated hearing with the picks being 'Dandaalayya','Oka Praanam' and 'Hamsa Naava'.Cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar was top notch and managed to capture the visual grandeur of the movie.Art direction part was handled well by Sabu Cyril.Editing by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao was good.Overall,Baahubali -The Conclusion' is a stunning visual extravaganza,a must watch cinematic experience from preferably the best theater in your locality.Take a Bow,SS Rajmouli ! __/\\__",

Half the crowd that has seen this movie has done so to see the \"extravagance\". Secondly, we must appreciate the promotions. While we see the obvious success of Prabhas promoting this movie using Tropicana, we are left to wonder whether we should have Rajnikanth promote Heinz ketchup for his next.This movie is rife with references (all unintentional I hope). A chariot scene that has the technological advancement of a \"Ben Hur\" parody from the 70's. Slow motion sequences that look like the leftovers of the puke-worthy drama in \"300\". To round it all up, a script that is reminiscent of the \"lion king\" trilogy (archetypal).This movie is the bane of Indian cinema. It is deeply saddening to see the Indian cinema industry fall so hard on its back. Maybe this movie should be given to us, Film students, as a crash course on what not to do when directing a movie. Despite all intents and purposes, you will leave the theater not comprehending the general lack of the two and a half hours you spent there.The only thing this film reminds us of is that of the tale of \"King Solomon and the spider\". Rajamouli is the spider, who will not give up despite his many failures. The crowd that watches this movie and hails him as a God, just ask yourself this.

But good movies hyped as great movies actually always fall short of expectations and become average movies, that's what exactly happened here.The movie started with the stories of flashback, we see Bahubali moving out of Mahismati with Katappa, ending up finding his lady love, as usual romance, entering Bhallaldev and playing all dirty politics to keep his step brother away from the throne. Big brother happily left his deserving throne and marry his lady love, then more conspiracy by the jealous brother who's now the king and at last successful killing Bahubali and prison his wife. From here it's the continuation of the first part.Acting is good, at least by all the central characters, especially Sathyaraj who had the lion's share of screen presence. Anushka and Prabhas did a good job. Rana stood out though had limited opportunities. Actually, He was the only one who looked authentic. Now the biggest part of the movie, \"Why Katappa killed Bahubali?\", we movie goers who can analyze stories have figured it out long back, right after the first part. Hint: The same reason why Bhishma though fond of Pandavas and supported them, fought against them. There was no surprise at all actually.We have seen many such movies, An honest upright warrior, and prince about to be the king, a badass villain who's also his brother conspire against him and get him killed. Then his son comes back for a revenge. A very clich\u00e9d effort. The graphics are so so, though I am not very convinced. The movie almost looks like an animation movie. I really felt director should have concentrated on the story more, at least there should be some twists and turns, there could be breakout villain. but it was very plain and simple.In the end in a lighter note, there's a hidden lesson for married men. It shows what happens when you let your mom and wife gets into a fight and you end up supporting your wife, but then, if support your mom you are a Momma's boy and if you support your wife you are a wife's puppet. Horn of Dilemma of course.... :D :DConclusion: One-time watch as per me.",

The plot is weak, predictable, and similar to any South Indian movie where the protagonist goes through hardships, someone gets murdered, and someone seeks revenge. Too many South Indian melodramatic movies have the same story line. Key disappointments are as follows:1. Tamanna Bhatia has 0 dialogues 2. Tamanna Bhatia's story has no reference in the movie. The role of the revel group is unclear 3. Katappa is shown as powerful, but his personality, figure, persona, and body language is quite the contrary, as in, weak, feeble, emotional, and helpless. 4. Action sequences are ridiculous. The most disappointing and also the funniest part of the movie, particularly how soldiers are propelled into the kingdom using cocunut trees. 5. Ramaya's, the queen mother's performance is too melodramatic. A queen should be shown as strong, political, and powerful. Ramaya is shown as a melodramatic woman with extrapolate daughter expressions. 6. Protagonist looks weak as compared to the antagonist. I was rooting for the antagonist. 7. The plot is weak, there is nothing new. 8. Why dis the Adivasi army attack the kingdom in part 1 is never discussed / described. I thought the war in part 1 was totally random. 9. What happened to the love story between young Bahubali and Tamanna Bhatia? 10. Last 15-20 mins seemed like a \"wrap up\" job, where the director wanted to finish and wind up real quick. Overall, I recommend not spending any money for watching this movie in the theatres. Watch it at home on one of the streaming websites. Generally very disappointing, but I am glad that it got over.",

            "content": "BAHUBALI : THE CONCLUSION REVIEW - A film which has taken Audience anticipation to next level finally released today and how can i miss FDFS? No way, Prequel released 22 months ago and everyone is waiting for the film since then and Film actually Worths that wait. Bahubali2 sets an Example for every Filmmaker in India that how to make a Complete Commercial film for all kind of audience. Almost all Highest grossing Indian films had quality and that quality was converted into commercial success but Bahubali does not have Quality, instead It Is The Best Commercial Film in The History Of Indian Cinema. Let me Elaborate.Acting- Acting field does not offer anything as characters got nothing to do as an Actor but their Style, Attitude and Passion is Perfect.Writing - Story also does not offer anything new, but you will get a satisfying answer to why Katappa killed Baahubali.Screenplay - Outstanding. It offers every upcoming ordinary scene in Extraordinary Fashion. Completely gripped First half with Full dose of Entertainment. Comedy, Action, Claps, Whistles, Goosebumps everything is there. Second half is story oriented and takes pace in last 1 hour.Music- Music is Dull, don't know why they added songs in this Film? Completely Useless, perhaps the only time when you can leave your seats for a while. But Background score is Brilliant, it is used only in important scenes and it leaves you with Jitters.Cinematography -Cinematography is of a whole New level, can't imagine this kind of Excellent camera work.Visual Effects - It's a visual treat to watch Grand and eye pleasing locations and War scenes. Surely gonna swap all awards for VFX.Direction - After watching Bahubali 1 and 2, i hereby declare SS Rajamouli \"The Best Commercial Director In India.\" What a Vision and what an Execution, it is something that's beyond imagination of every good director in India. Some typical south flavor massy scenes are there but forgettable because of many never seen before scenes. Let's take a moment and Appreciate Rajamouli sir for making best ever Historic and Epic Commercial films in the Indian cinema History. After this Film i'm excited what's his Next? I mean just can't stop thinking about his Direction Skills.Final Words - Overall Bahubali The Conclusion is a MUST WATCH film for Every Indian Who always complaints that our industry can't make Magnum Opus films like Hollywood. This films worth double, triple of whatever your ticket rate is. This film will have highest Repeat Value in this 21st Century. I didn't like Bahubali1 that much still it became Highest Grossing Indian Film, so at Box Office Bahubali2 has no Limits. Just Go for it and enjoy this Historic film, once, twice, thrice or more times. Commercially 10/10, critically 6/10 so i'm going with 8/10* to balance it.",

To all the people who claim about the VFX, I am amazed, which visual effects were convincing? The way Bahubali landed like a polystyrene sheet or the palaces and all those unacceptable architecture, the plaster-of-Paris elephants and horses. The action sequences were extreme even from mythological or fantasy point of view. Talking about physics, An apple fell on Newton's head and he asked why?- That's how gravity came to us. SS Rajmauli saw a coconut tree and asked why? When we look at the script almost 80% of the script is trivial, the first half is intolerable especially Prabhas' performance. The reason Kattappa killed Bahubali was acceptable, on the other end nothing else was. Talking about their performance, Rana Daggubati pulled a good role, all the others overacted at some point of time, this includes Prabhas, Satyaraj, Anushka Shetty, Ramya Krishnan etc. Tammannah was barely seen or she would have ruined it more. Over-all a below average movie with a heavy unbearable budget and an unbelievable box office collection.",

            "content": "I don't think 1000 words will be sufficient to write my thoughts about this movie. I've followed S S Raja Mouli's work right from his first film and have been an admirer of his work ever since. One strong reason is that I enjoy action genre and Raja Mouli's movies have terrific action sequences.When I bought a ticket for Baahubali: The Beginning, I knew I was going to be entertained but didn't realise I was going to witness such a visual spectacle. After many many years, here was a movie which had repeat value. And with every repeated viewing, the movie only kept growing on me. So when Baahubali 2: The Conclusion was releasing, my expectation was sky high. The last time I was so excited and eager for a movie release was for The Matrix Reloaded. I wanted to get the best experience, so I booked a ticket in an IMAX screen and since I was watching the Telugu version in a screen in Chennai, I didn't have my family accompanying me. I had gone to the theatre alone with a promise that I'd take them to see the Tamil version later. It so happened that the guy sitting next to me had also come to see the movie solo, he had just moved to Chennai and he had seen the movie already once. I come back home after the movie and my wife wanted to know how the movie was. My answer was \"Disappointed\". I did not like the movie when I saw it the first time. Throughout the first half, I kept saying to myself that that is not how Amarendra Baahubali or Kattappa would behave, I wasn't expecting the first hour to be so light hearted and kept on picking stuff that I had not imagined would be part of the movie. Was the movie really bad? Well, we all know the answer. No.... the reason wasn't that the movie was bad, the reason was that I already had a movie playing in my head and I was expecting that movie to unfold on the screen before me. This experience has thought me that if you really want to enjoy a movie, don't step into the theatre with preconceived notions of what the film will be like. Go with a clean slate and if the movie is good, you will enjoy it.So when I went to see Baahubali 2: The Conclusion the second time with my family, this time in a theatre that was jam packed, I fell in love with the movie. And that love, admiration is only increasing with every repeat viewing. Visually, this moving is stunning. Words can't really describe the experience, you need to watch it to feel it. Yes, it has inspirations drawn, so did the greatest of visually stunning movies like Avatar. Its about adding your own interpretation to it and S S is a master in that. You might say there are few things which are hard to digest or unbelievable, well its a fantasy movie and if you see the movie as one, you will not complain. Rarely do you see such attention to details in movies. You would have noticed the obvious scenes like the opening credit or the chariot crash scene. But I will mention these 2 scenes where such detailing wasn't required but goes on show how much effort has been put in.1. The angry elephant - agreed its VFX, but it could have been a simple elephant. But observe the detailing on the elephant, the ornaments and the other accessories it has on. This is serious detailing, not lazy filmmaking.2. The scene when Mahendra Baahubali reaches on the roof of Mahishmathi palace using palm tree (remember... its a fantasy film). Notice the scene where Prabhas is running and observe the detailing in the background.This is serious filmmaking, passionate filmmaking. More power to you director saab!! Special mention to M M Keeravani's background score. One of the best I've heard, me and my 8 year old keep humming the score. It stays with you well after you've finished watching the movie. Pity, they haven't released the BG track separately.This movie is a must watch!!",

So, I'll dwelve rather on what one expected from the movie and what one got.Exp -Magnum opus with brilliant VFX Act - Brilliant VFX indeed with Kingdom, Dream sequences and war scenes portrayed effectively to border disbeliefExp - Enhancing the character of Bahubali n son, Devsana, Bhallaldev, Sivagami and Kattappa with brilliant one- liners. Act - Characters watered down with very few one-liners to keep the audience hooked. Sivagami's fierceness gets lost, Kattappa's loyalty questioned, Bhallaldev's might becomes more brain than brawn and worst, even Bahubali ends up wasting his arm strength and skillsExp- A nuanced script where politics and drama get overshadowed by pure heroics and camera following lead character all the time. Act- A muddled script reminiscent of good old Mahabharat serial of schemes and sub- schemes where Bahubali keeps losing without any retributionExp - Music which would create awe and timed beautifully to take the movie forward. Act - BGM remains good enough, but the songs didn't deliver, especially the romantic number between Devsana and Bahubali on which a good share of budget gets wastedExp - Last but not the least, an epic climax and final war, which would go on for an hour and where Sivadu finally manages to kill Bhallaldev against all odds Act - Kind of anti climax, which feels edited too much and put together fast enough to ensure reasonable running time and enough shows to hit Rs. 500 Crs collection in a weekAll in all, somewhere the commercials seem to have overtaken the story, melodrama overshadowing an epic in making and VFX substituting genuine acting.Independently, keeping aside the expectations, the film has been done well, with good BGM, main characters building up muscles, graphics team putting a lot of efforts and the costumes team doing well too. The love story between Bahubali and Devsana develops like a typical Bollywood potboiler with fake acting and a caricature wannabe boyfriend in the middle; finally blooming to a romance with a dream sequence in clouds on a flying ship. Anushka shetty as Devasena, to her credit delivers a wonderful performance as the young devasana with strong dialogues and attitude.However, as the 'Conclusion' ends and a dialogue giving a hint of another sequel pours out, the excitement of crowd is nowhere to be seen. But for those times where you have open mouth stared and cheered for our hero when he nonchalantly massacred people, conquered animals and even challenged nature, 'Jai Mahishmati'.",

Not because of its VFX, not at all, but because of the storytelling. The VFX of the first movie were definitely over-hyped and were maybe better than your typical bollywood crap but nowhere in the league of an average Hollywood movie. I think they were worse than that of Magadheera for that matter. But I still loved the movie because I felt there was a wonderful story waiting to be discovered in this entire series and it was being told in a very nice way, innovative for an Indian movie. Coming to the second part now. It's utter nonsense. Here, I said it. VFX are a huge step down from the first movie and there are a lot of scenes, where you can tell that the set or the fight is absolutely fake. But as I said, I don't judge Indian movies purely on VFX ever because I know that our budget can not match that of Hollywood. The biggest disappointment for me was the storyline, or the lack of it, and the way it was told. The first half had almost no story development. It was filled with the same old overused cheap gimmicks that have been done in like a hundred Indian movies. Hero is champ but he acts like a dumb person and ends up wooing heroine. Crap. Highly predictable. The director turned Katappa, one of the biggest shines of the first movie for me, into a joker just to appease the mass. Now, I didn't have any great interest in why Katappa killed Bahubali. I think everyone had this clue that it had to have happened on the orders of Sivagami, and so it was also obvious that she must have been duped by her husband and son, still, the curiosity was to know how. And boy did that disappoint!! I don't know how anyone can take that thread of a storyline and fast as the wind of a story development, for an answer to the question that had become the centre of interest of millions of people in last two- three years. It was pure nonsense. In an era when we have Game of Thrones to understand the depth of politics that kings and warriors can connive, this thing felt like coming right out of an early 90s' Indian movie. And people are satisfied with it???It just dampens my belief in our people's ability to think. We just accept any half-baked poorly conceived idea for a plot. And it is that because of which our writers don't take the pain to think deeply over the plot lines. Deeply disappointed by the movie. I had high hopes but I should have known better. Unfortunately, the type of hype this movie has received is going to spoil Indian cinema's image everywhere. People all over the world won't come to know that we are also capable of making Drishyam; they would remember us with Bahubali 2.",

            "content": "A strong story line built upon the enriches of Indian mythologies and it's closely resembling characters. We have a very strong cultural background of Vedas, Puranas and the great mythological epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata. I grew up reading these big epics and after so many years I witnessed an epic film - 'Baahubali - A Man with strong arms'. I celebrated this Indian Magnum Opus just like the way I have celebrated all time great blockbusters in Hollywood and Bollywood.If we can accept the great stories like Harry Potter, Lord of the rings trilogy, the famous Game of thrones series (which has its own heroes following the same dharma - righteous path to combat evil), then we shall also celebrate Baahubali too. SS Rajamouli - (Director) had made sure that we have enough heroic personalities and larger than life characters in our own mythological epic stories. There are many reasons to celebrate the humongous Baahubali 2 too.Baahubali 2 is not about box office numbers, it is a story which has managed to unite entire India irrespective of state, language, film industry based on a simple question - 'Why Katappa killed Baahubali'?, it is most certain that the direction, power of narration and screenplay has created an impact and liking towards the film. Don't forget, Baahubali 1 - The Beginning had laid the initial footprint two years ago and the first part of the movie was not forgotten.Baahubali 2 rides on the momentum from where the first part has left. It has it's own filmy moments that deliver goosebumps to the viewers and the famous fight scenes that galore within itself. Claps thud, whistles blow, shouts from the viewers during several moments which cannot be expressed in words. It is a film which doesn't rely solely on VFX, thought it has been touted as the best film with extraordinary visuals. It doesn't disappoint the viewers and the execution was strong enough to make a visual impact.Baahubali is our own Indian super hero who follows the simple righteous path of Dharma and character is well sculpted. Emphasis is thoroughly laid on every finer detail in the film. Devasena and Sivagami are the two most powerful women characters which one can see in recent times. Bhalaladeva looks intimidatingly venomous through his expressions. Kattappa's is always the go to warrior who bows his head to the King. Background score of this film has been excellent and it keeps the audience enthralled and entertained. Baahubali's character and it's powerful screen presence gets elevated with magnificent BGM.Baahubali, undoubtedly is a proud Indian film that broke barriers, it has proved that with a strong subject and excellent directional execution one can reach the sky. Eventually, it is the character Baahubali himself that prevails in every viewer's mind and imagination. The world wide appreciation as reported from top news channels such as Guardian, Wall street Journal etc has been remarkable. It has set a new benchmark in the Indian film industry and it is striking the doors of Hollywood as it already turned down the some of the newly released Hollywood blockbusters in terms of Box-office collections.Instead of criticizing the film and finding out flaws in CGI, Indians should stand up and applaud 'Baahubali' for it's impact and contribution to Indian cinema. My rating is 10/10 and it has been an unbelievable experience watching it on big screen. It is flawless and I take a bow to the hard work put in by the entire cast and crew of the film. It teaches us the sole aspect of belief and execution. SS Rajamouli believed in the subject(Bahubali) with lot of conviction, he braved the odds and he breathed fire and life into it. The result, we can see everywhere.....thanks to the story teller himself. Baahubali will be remembered across decades and it lives on.....",

Gladiator, which was released more than 10 years ago has better CGI. The story-line itself isn't so great. Most of it is taken out of Mahabharata. If you are looking for cringe moments, you got plenty. From soldiers flying around by a swing of a sword, the male chauvinistic attitudes (My favorite being appeasing angry mom/mom-in-law by giving her a grandson), the Southern flavored romance between Prabhas and Anushka with a comic sidekick used as a ploy and the best of all: elastic coconut trees slinging soldiers into the castle and they bouncing off their shields unhurt. You name it, you got it. The only saving grace in the move is Anushka Shetty. All in All, this movie is a bad advertisement to Indian cinema. This is the highest grosser of Indian Cinema of which I'm also one of the guilty contributors. I really feel ashamed now.",

This movie will grab your attention from the introductory scene (goosebumps worthy) till almost the entire length of the film. It has a high energy throughout and a lot of credit for that goes to the grand visuals along with exceptional acting from all actors, especially Ramya as Shivagami and Prabhas as Amarendra Baahubali. For me, the most powerful sequence comes in the middle of the movie, this is our GoT moment and this one sequence alone shows the potential of Indian Cinema, you will know what I am talking about once you watch the movie. Another amazing yet subtle thing to notice is how Prabhas has played two different characters, the calm, experienced demeanor of Amarendra Baahubali and the rough- edged, not-groomed persona of Mahendra Baahubali. Kudos to him. You will notice some over the top action sequences where S. S. Rajamouli has taken liberty to show us fresh imaginative action which adds to the fun factor. The movie does die down towards the end, however that is bound to happen considering the fact that it was adrenaline-pumping for so long. It takes great directorial vision and deep pockets of producers to make this happen and hopefully the success of this film triggers the rise of more such epics that we can enjoy. This is a must watch. Just the sheer scale of visual effects and production value is breath-taking, no one should miss this.",

Now the second part came with so much hype that it was a one in a lifetime experience kind of a movie.Let me start out by saying this movie is so far fetched from what the ratings say about this movie. Everything about the movie is over the top. Direction, acting, overpowering music, over use of vfx. It seemed like the director wanted to show that they threw a lot of money into every scene to make it look good. Good looks do not make a good movie. There are many illogical and unrealistic scenes that come at regular intervals that make the movie look bad. The vfx were so overused and were used at locations that did not even need them.In short, the first half had silly comedy and the tempo gets better towards the interval. Second half of the movie starts out good with the story but very predictable as it progresses.Overall Rajamouli might have increased the scale of imagination and money making with baahubali for telugu movies but he has a lot to learn about filmmaking from legendary directors like KV. Reddy, K. Kameshwara Rao,C. Pullayya, Vittalacharya who made great movies of this genre with limited budget and no graphics.",

The plot  is highly predictable, clich\u00e9d and sloppy to say the least . It  reminded me the movies from 80's and early 90's where everything used  to be stereotyped ,be it the story, narratives or screenplay. Instead  of giving more emphasis on a proper conclusion ,its more about showing  the facts/reasons behind Kattappa killing Bahubali. When one speaks  about the word revenge , one must highlight how the revenge is taken.  The focus should be on devising the plans and the execution process .  In the second part of the magnum opus the story revolves around  bahubali,kattappa and devsena.The characters of bhallaldeva(main  antagonist),shivgami play second fiddle in the movie .We get to see a  prolonged storyline of the romance between prabhas &  anushka,unnecessary average songs and a lot of hullabaloo involving the  war sequence. The weakest part of the story is the fact that its highly  predictable.The writer could have used a few twist and turns to make  the plot more intriguing.The climax is disappointing .One would expect  a proper face off between bhallaldeva and bahubali.However it appears  that the makers were in a hurry to wrap up the movie in the limited  amount of screen timing.  The only notable praiseworthy factors about the movie are the graphics  and special effects . The director has put a significant amount of  effort for the grandeur of the project. However he could have chosen a  better way of storytelling and mostly a mature plot ,given the  gargantuan effort (in terms of time and money) involved with the film .",

            "content": "=====SPOILER FREE==== #BAAHUBALI2 is the best film that has ever been made in Indian cinema and considering the amount of emotions that are attached with this film, it is sure to rank among the classics this world has ever produced.India is blessed to have directors like Rajamouli.His creativity and imagination is beyond comparison.He simply brought the best out of all the characters, all the actors.I haven't seen such VFX's, such cinematography, such screenplay anywhere else.Coming to acting all the actors have delivered career defining performances be it RANA,ANUSHKA,SATHYARAJ,RAMYA,TAMANNA(for the first part) but the man who has simply changed the rules of the game is PRABHAS. There is a certain kind of royalty that is attached to him yet it is his humane nature that makes him absolutely endearing.What an actor!!!He is the definition of what a Superstar is. VERDICT-Overall Bollywood will never have the balls to make a film like this ever because films like these require passion, commitment, patience and creativity that Bollywood lacks.MAHABHARATA can only be made by RAJAMOULI and nobody else. BAAHUBALI is a phenomenon that will easily earn a minimum of 1000cr.Nothing can best it in the near future.It is a classic that will be foretold to future generation as the \"Movie of this generation\". Go experience this once in a lifetime event.RATING-This film can't be rated because of its super humanness, magnanimity and grandeur.You have to see it to believe it.",

The style of storytelling was excellent, thought it was bit of slow in the beginning, but slowly it picked up and never looked back. Cinematography, natural landscape, settings and some of the scenes are overwhelming and spectacular! The camera-work is so immersive, a visual journey through the Mahishmati and Kunthala Samrajyam. Also with great performances not only by Prabhas and Rana but equally everyone, Nazar was exceptional and in fact he stole the show.All my stars go towards the story, beautiful picturization, production value and performances. All in all, this film felt less like a story of revenge between two brothers but more like an epic to the intuitive beauty of visual effects. It provides an extremely fascinating and touching experience to those who have an affinity for the mythological stories, but it's also a visual masterpiece and a great piece of modern filmmaking for cinema lovers. It's a perfect movie, a film likes of which we will only rarely get to see - if at all - in the future. Baahubali \u2013 The Conclusion' is visual poetry of the most ancient kind background sceneries, and it should be seen on the biggest screen possible. Last but not the least, this is equally (if not superior) in par with Baahubali 1. Go watch in theater before someone tells you \"why kattappa killed baahubali\" and experience the journey!!!",

Well, I assure you, the wait for that answer was worth more than the stunts, songs or a budget of 2.5 billion INR.. It probably was a combination of one of the most emotionally and frustratingly epic scene I've ever witnessed in Indian cinema.. Just the grandeur of that one scene gave for some goosebumps; for some a prolonged tear jerker; and for some absolute silence with awe.The Conclusion is helmed on 5 shoulders.. #Prabhas, #Sathyaraj, #RanaDaggubati, #AnushkaShetty and #RamyaKrishan, who have all done their parts well. But the strength of the movie is Prabhas who literally lived the character. The support cast have all done their parts brilliantly.3 hours 15 minutes: Having watched it in Bahrain, I was surrounded with the thrill of sitting in a cinema in India; whistles, claps and howls of joy; every scene was celebrated.This movie had a good mix of soulful songs, witty one liners, amazing sound effects, bgm, beautiful locations (both original and visually created), grand sets, hard hitting stunts and touching moments placed aptly.I had read earlier that the VFX is in par with #TheLordOfTheRings and #HarryPotter.. I would say it is top notch for Indian cinema. Although I did not understand a word, I watched this movie in the language it was conceived - Telugu. Wanted to keep it as original as possible. It was a challenge coordinating the scene with the subs, but if I'm still recommending it, you must understand how good this movie must have been.

With the help of some villagers how can he fight to BHALLALDEV. Very poor style used in last fight when using palm tree to jump the fort....LOLThe crucial thing is Pace of BAAHUBALI 1 was same and perfect and let watcher to enjoy the movie. On other hand in 2Nd part movies run so fast that no one remembered what scene just passed away.Personnaly I really missed Romance between AMRENDER BAAHUBALI and DEVSENA ( Anushka Shetty was looking so beautiful in every scene). At least there should be 1 line conversation should show. Full scene of KUNTHAL state cover to KUMAR BERMA.By the way I will miss the part 2 in my life.

How clich\u00e9 is it!? A mother waiting for a son to come take back the throne from an evil king who had killed his father? All the critics who are not criticizing this film for the lack of physics? And it's thin plot line, why do you not criticize all other normal films? When i saw baahubali the beginning i was very disappointed that this wasn't worth the hype and the answer to the infamous \"why kattapa killed baahubali\" question seemed rather obvious to me and I'm sure many people knew the answer to it,but nevertheless\u200b , it's good to build hype for part 2 and today when i saw baahubali 2 i was even more disappointed. Why were so many great vfx shots wasted on such illogical , laws of physics defying stunts? And how did all the critics (and audience of course) find certain characters' acting good?(katappas overly exaggerated action in the first half, nazzar throughout the movie). Its making money , a loads to say, but how are people making this film the pride of India? How?? Is this what Indian audience have grown up to? People without super powers fly, do superhuman stuff, but can still be stabbed to death by someone close to you? Then why do Hollywood filmmakers go beyond boundaries to make movies with grand visuals and still has decent stunts in it? Why do they put so much research into their films? Why don't they make films like these where anything can happen and if you are the protagonist you are good to go , challenge the world. I know this review won't matter to most and i will be considered anti national for this but i sincerely hope Indian audience evolve some day and our filmmakers make more believable films and not whatever comes into their mind.",

A lot of unreal sequences that make you laugh at some points, (how does a person get on fire and not burn?). If some of these sequences were in a bollywood film, critics and audiences would've trolled it and given the film bad ratings, then why not for this? i'm shocked at why this film earned so much, maybe cause tickets were priced higher than other movies. overall it's just an Over-hyped movie. don't waste money on it. there are better films way better than this which go unnoticed because of low budgets. just because this movie has earned so much it doesn't make it the best.",

U will miss the glory of an Indian epic movie if u don't watch it.This review is like a message to those sick people who gave low ratings to this epic movie. This is not a biased review.Most of the people are trying to criticize this movie saying that the reason, why Katappa killed Bahu Bali, is not a strong reason.I think they have not seen the movie and are trying to degrade this movie. Or if they have seen it then they must be holding a personal grudge against the crew who worked for this movie.The reason was given in this movie, it is well & clear. Sivagami was blinded by her husband and son. I don't want to spoil the story!!!I'm a big fan of foreign movies(Hollywood and Korean) because they really make some sensible movies. I was never into Tollywood movies from the beginning. But, I have started watching movies from Tollywood recently and so far \"Bahubali: the conclusion\" tops my list when it comes to Telugu movies.Reasons:1. Forget about the VFX, I wasn't expecting much from an Indian movie since the budget is low. But, our people still pulled it out, they made it big and I was impressed by their work.2. Movie Cast: Yes the cast is excellent, SSR is really a wise guy when it comes cast in his movies. Each and every actor who played their roles fulfilled them with near perfection. Even the Junior artists!!!3. Each & every second that is related to the past is amazing.4. Though the story is predictable the way it is represented on the movie screen by SSR is amazing. 5. The movie is high with morals, yes it teaches us about the good and evil.6. It teaches us \"What exactly the King is?\" 7. It teaches us about the importance of relationships, the relationship between King and his people, the relationship between a mother and a son, the relationship between brothers and between a father and a son, and between the ruler and his trustworthy servant.8. High in morals, there are so many epic scenes. I don't want to spoil this review by mentioning them here. You will notice them anyhow.9. There are situations in which Bahubali will be puzzled and have to decide whether he should stand by his mother or by Dharma(ethics) which were taught to him by his mother(Sivagami).10. The movie shows us something which is useful to everyone, it is self-confidence. If you believe in yourself you can do anything. (Kumara Varma)11. It tells us that \"in order to achieve good sometimes you need to do some sacrifices\".I can write a few more but I'm running out of time I don't want u get bored of by my review.There are some mistakes in this movie, I think most of the people would not notice them. You will find them in climax as well but who cares by the time you reach climax you will be impressed by the past of Amarendra Bahubali.Dandalayya song is really awesome, it really suits our King(Prabahs).The one who is giving a low rating to a movie just because of the mistakes, well I would like to tell them one thing:\"Don't think. FEEEEEEEEL the movie! It's like a finger pointing away to the moon. Do not concentrate on the finger(mistakes) or you will miss all of the heavenly glory!\"",

Movie is a larger than life sequel of the Rise and Fall and again rise of Amrendra Bahubali. Story is good, Special effects are awesome, songs are not much appealing compared to the previous one and fight scenes are good though have an over dose of unrealism(but we can't complain as it's long awaited bahubali-2). Story starts with a quick recap of the first part. Runs with the love story of Bahubali-Devsena, what led to the sacrifice of Sivagami, murder of Bahubali and ends up with much awaited revenge and win of good over bad. Prabhas is good and his larger than life portrayal as a king is awesome. Anushka is good as a Princess and matched well with Prabhas. Rana is Badly good as the previous one. Both Ramaiya and Naseer did well in their respective roles. Tamannah's screen presence is next to nothing. Special effects are awesome, specially the fight scenes(I thought I'm watching a Hercules movie, LOL). Bahubali has proved that we are also capable of making such films which can match up to the standard of west. Even after all this, still there is some disappointment (I don't know what is leading me to this, may be the expectations were too high). Movie is good and give it a shot after all we all deserve to know why 'Katappa Killed Bahubali'.",

            "content": "Baahubali 2\u2013 The Conclusion: The much-awaited sequel to Bahubali \u2013 The beginning is finally released and it indeed deserved all the attention it gathered prior to its release itself. Part 1 was certainly grand and spectacular, and Part 2 is even grander and visually spectacular. Since Baahubali \u2013 The beginning was immensely successful, it was very natural for the audience to have huge expectations from its sequel. Generally, when the prequel is very successful, it becomes very difficult for the sequel to set new bench marking standards, but with Baahubali-2, it is entirely different, it has enhanced its own standard, creating new records as far as the box office success is concerned, and also superior in the craft. Filmmaker SS Rajamouli might have definitely experienced the stress to make the sequel much better than the prequel and now he can relax after making this magnificent film. This epic is certainly going to be registered in the Indian Cinema's history for the kind of huge canvas it has used to share the story, the efforts were taken by the cast and crew to make it a visual extravaganza. A must-watch, a sure shot blockbuster, etched in Indian Cinema's history forever. This is originally filmed in Telugu and Tamil and also dubbed in Hindi and Malayalam.In Baahubali : The beginning, the story was of Shiva Alias Mahendra Baahubali (Prabhas) falling in love with Avantika (Tamannaah). Shiva takes up the responsibility to fulfill Avantika's mission of rescuing Devasena (Anushka Shetty) from the imprisonment of Bhallala Deva (Rana Daggubati), King of Mahishmathi kingdom without knowing how he is related to Devasena as well as this kingdom. While rescuing Devasena, he gets surprised when he is being identified as Baahubali. Later on, when he comes face to face with Kattappa (Sathyaraj), the truth unfolds before him in regard to his identity of being the son of Amarendra Baahubali (Prabhas in a double role) and Devasena. The first part ends up with the confession of Kattappa that it was he who killed Amarendra Baahubali. Kattappa's confession raised a very pertinent question and the whole set of the audience kept wondering why a loyal person like Kattappa killed Amarendra Baahubali. Now about Baahubali 2 : The Conclusion, without trying to review this epic film, let me just express that this film takes us through the answers to all those questions which we had after watching the first part: What sort of power play happens in the kingdom which resulted in the initial scene of injured Sivagami (Ramya Krishnan) trying to save the child. Who was Sivagami ? What is the story of two brothers Amarendra Baahubali and Bhallala Deva (Rana Daggubati)? How does the character of Kattappa (warrior slave of the kingdom) shape up in the film? What made Kattappa kill Amarendra Baahubali ? How did Amarendra and Devasena meet ? Was power the only reason for the rivalry between Amarendra Baahubali and Bhallala Deva ? What happens when the characters suffer from the inner conflict of making a choice between Dharma and Karma, what do they choose?It is not that the plot is unpredictable, we can assume many happenings of the sequel, but what makes this sequel so special is that how Rajamouli has done the storytelling, making even the most obvious so intriguing in the film. This is one of the best aspects of the film which needs to be highlighted.The film begins on a very lighter note with Amarendra Baahubali and Kattappa's friendly banters, Amarendra's falling in love with Devasena. As the film progresses, the plot gets into the rivalry of Bhallala with Amarendra, Bhallala and Bijjala Deva's crooked ways, conspiracies, power snatching, Amarendra's righteousness, Mahendra fighting back etc. Some breathtaking visuals are: Amarendra leaping into the air and shooting off three arrows in one go, the battlefield's projection, the Mahishmathi Kingdom itself, the climax etc. The musical scores are integrated and in sync with the screenplay. If the first part saw some great performances of Prabhas, Rana and Tamannah, the second part showcased even better performances from Prabhas, Rana, Ramya Krishnan and Anushka Shetty. Prabhas has great screen presence. He is good as both Amarendra Baahubali and Mahendra Baahubali, plays both the characters effortlessly and with much ease. He is indeed a superstar to look out for in the coming days. Rana Daggubati looks huge on screen and his physical transformation to adapt to Bhallala Deva's role is absolutely commendable. Even his body language expressed his character so well. Both Prabhas and Rana have made their on-screen rivalry look very much credible through their performances. Anushka Shetty as Devasena and Ramya Krishnan as Sivagami have given stupendous performances. Both of them are very good as headstrong, feisty and powerful women. Sathyaraj as Kattappa has done so much justice to his role, he is there in almost all the frames in the film. Nassar as Bijjala Deva does generate disliking for his character through his wonderful acting. Subbaraju as Kumara Varma is also very good. What was missing in part 2 was that of Tamannah's character Avantika. She played a very strong and a prominent character in the first part which was not further developed in Baahubali 2 : The Conclusion. One could get to see her glimpses only in 2 hours 47 minutes of the film. This was really sad. Another character which was not given importance in the sequel is that of Sanga (Rohini).Rajamouli's magnum opus Baahubali 2: The Conclusion has been designed on a huge canvas, be it its production design, visual appeal, awesome performances, background score or narration. It is indeed a visual extravaganza and a treat to watch the film on big screen. A must- watch, a sure shot blockbuster, etched in Indian Cinema's history forever.",

While I understand the character is powerful but she could have sorted the matter speaking a bit more politely. She kept on insulting the mother without a hiccup. Third thing, the fight sequences were absolutely rubbish. Fourth, the reasons for Kattappa to kill Bahubali were not good enough, if he was too loyal he could have killed himself. Fifth, the movie is very stereotypical. Same story presented in medieval times. I am sorry, I have seen good movies and this is definitely not up there with the good ones. Illogical sequences of the movie left me nothing but disappointed.",

Is it really worth of crossing 1000 cores mark ??, I may be insane according to many in saying the movie is never a perfect war flick but just a documentary in mixture of Indian sentiments, romantic scenes, immature graphics, loud BM audience elevation scenes and all in all a commercial, nearly 3hours business package, which in the name of REGIONAL PATRIOTISM people poured money tearing their pockets, in lack of genuine judgment. I wonder had any Indian director made a movie like Gladiator, that had a perfect Royal story of unique kind, or had made a movie Titanic, that hit screens way back 1997, it is not a brow rising movement for us, as there would have been temples for the directors. Imagine the graphic content of Harry potter, the very beginner of the series in 2000, can you compare the quality to this great BB2 of 2017\u00a0wid17yrs of technology ahead..., and still our people hail it saying THE WORLD IS LOOKING FOR BB2, my word !!, the Gods of insanity dancing on our heads. A genuine person of my kind ( I believe so ) should say, should the \" Y \" factor of BB1, (I mean y the man killed the other) carry this huge mess of talk ?? I don't understand, with this kind of technology on update and thousands of movies available, is it this BB2 that should have a\u00a0bhajan\u00a0in many\u00a0parts\u00a0of modern India. Y not \"Kong\" grab d whole sight of attention despite one of the greatest visuals on screen, imagine a comparison between the bulls scene of BB2 and any scene of Kong and now stick ti your words. When a person says the budget of Kong makes its visuals look much better then a true person must shout out loud ' then why not a movie like Kong had this talk of town and nit an average movie like BB2' well our people don't accept because..., we are Regional Lovers and doubt mind a quality OTHER ! Only two things must clarify this review, either people are \" Frogs in well \" that we know only BB2 so we rate it this high, or they are illiterates, for after watching perfectly classic visual wonders still sticking to \" SAHO BB2 \"\u00a0becz\u00a0they understood nothing English !! I conclude saying PV SINDU had the 2nd place of badminton in Olympics recently but got the whole crappy hails and cores of money, while the 1st place Marin took her cash prize to continue life skilled life. I compare Sindu to BB2 and Marin to the really quality movies of west, in India ! I always wished bit to hear WORLD IS LOOKING AT OUR BB2 !!",

On the first place it  is quite shaded that who ordered katappa to kill bahu, Shibgami or  vallala? And when Vallala is the full fledged king why Shivgami is  taking decisions? No prerogative for Baahu and Devshena ? Characters  taking oaths every now and then! too much cheap drama and aggressive  (only to initiate a quarrel) attitude from the ladies. No Tamanna.  Ending is too quick and ordinary against high expectations. Sling Shot  scene was funny (Spartans are even nothing). Bhalla character could  show some personality (it wasn't necessary to portrait him as jealous,  villain and so negative; he could've been showed as neglected and raged  by his deprivations). Bhallal's promising character from part 1 went  clown in part 2. Story like a daily soap. COMPLETE DISASTER (A  Hollywood horror film named 'The Boy' failed me from sky to ground just  like this.

The expectations I had with respect to the VFX skyrocketed after looking at the way the title comes up. Simply superb! And then the director gives glimpses of Baahubali in a classical way. I loved the way he portrayed it. Kudos to his imagination. The story in part 2 starts just where it ended in part 1. All about Amarendra Baahubali. His entry scene is terrific with Saahore Baahubali playing in the background. Who would not love the bow and arrow scene where he uses the trunk of an elephant to shoot the arrow. Need not mention, the visuals were amazing then. Then starts the love episode with Devasena with a pinch of comedy. Anushka was at her best and her on-screen presence is awesome. She looks so beautiful than ever. Only when Baahubali falls in love with Devasena, will the real story starts. Intelligent fights throughout the movie. A bigger interval bang than part 1 but similar to it. Everything else becomes so small when compared to the way they portrayed Kattappa killing Baahubali. AMAZING. Everyone knows the story, so it all depends on the director's vision as it boils down to how extraordinarily he can deliver it. A lot of emotion and drama than fights. Would be a sin, if I don't mention the climax fight. I liked the way the army enters Mahishmathi fort. Those scenes were tremendous. On a closing note, the movie has some great VFX with terrific on-screen presence from Prabhas and Anushka. It would definitely break all the past records it set and would bring pride to Indian cinema. Rajamouli surely made every Telugu speaking person proud.

But then in the second half you are thrown into chaotic exaggeration of every action. Even a simple task as walking through a hallway are shown like a super epic scenes. Your ears are then slowly tortured with too much background sounds on every scenes. It feels like watching a reboot version of Game of thrones, Troy and The lord of the rings but with too much overkill. At one point i felt like Indian saas bahu \"action\" TV series and felt like closing my ears. But background music works are remarkable by AR Rahman. Story is also a mediocre one that shows the past events of bahubali part one. One of the most stupid things in a movie is the way they show father & son with a same physical appearance. Action scenes are over exaggerated. The fact that they are a normal human (not a superhero) but they could amazing superhuman feats. At one point they jump on the 100m tall wall without getting any injuries. Most of the characters have superhuman strength that made me thinking if the main character is really stronger than superman. VERDICT: If you prefer a mindless south Indian action type movies and spicy bollywood movies then this movie might be a full entertainer for you. If you enjoy slow paced well directed series like game of thrones then this is an over exaggerated overkill movie that is trying too much to be as big as bahubali part one but not better.Star Rating: 3/5",

            "content": "In anticipation of this movie, I organised a screening of the 2015 magnum opus for friends at my humble abode and I can safely proclaim that everyone enjoyed it. There are some movies which are not meant to be enjoyed alone; the spontaneous uproarious unbridled fist-pumping reactions of an audience drive up the enjoyment of the movie to a whole new level. Baahubali: The Beginning is that type of movie. With the right mindset and an adventurous spirit, the movie can open a door into a whole new world of cinematic pleasure.Baahubali: The Beginning literally ends with a jaw-dropping cliffhanger that matches the driving ambition of the narrative. For more than a year, I was thinking about how S.S. Rajamouli would explain the ending and after watching Baahubali 2: The Conclusion I was not only more than satisfied, I was stunned out of my senses. Putting both movies together, I can now clearly see that part 1 is just a world-building and character set-up appetiser, the scrumptious main dish and delectable dessert are all in the sequel. What a blast! That's it! Review is done! Go buy a ticket already!Still here? Okay\u0085 let me drop a few more paragraphs\u0085Baahabuli 2 takes us back to the kingdom of Mahishmati and puts a spotlight on the feud between Baahubali (Prabhas) and Bhallala Deva (Rana Daggubati). Will Shiva, the son of Baahubali, succeed against the tyrannical and treacherous Bhallala Deva? Will he regain authority of the kingdom that was snatched from his family by Bhallala Deva? Why did Bhallala Deva keep Devasena (Anushka Shetty) captive all these years? Why is Sivagami so determined to save the baby that she literally drowned standing up in a torrent of on- rushing water? Finally, the million-dollar question that was literally the final frame of Baahubali 1 is answered.S.S. Rajamouli's method of upping the ante for the sequel is the typical \"more is better\" approach, but he takes it much further. The visual opulence is astonishing, the kaleidoscope of colours awe-inspiring, the humongous sets jaw-dropping and the costumes resplendent beyond my wildest dreams. Every frame is meticulously crafted. Every detail and stylistic serve the narrative. He clearly understands what made the first movie so well-loved and we are given not one, not two, but three battles involving huge armies. But kudos to him for not making the battles feel repetitive by underscoring them with different stakes and fighting methods. The last one involving tall trees and human catapults is so inventive. I have seen hundreds of battles on the big screen, but I have never seen what was depicted here.Just like the earlier movie, this one reinvents its own rules and is totally devoid of cynicism. Comparing with the first film, Rajamouli takes fewer risks in this outing, but the narrative is still joyous and filled with court intrigue, family drama and deadly double-crosses. The characters may be the size of mountains, but they are flawed human beings with weaknesses that are absolutely cathartic. Yes, I know the main caveat on most people's mouth is that it is way over the top. But for this armchair movie buff and part-time critic, the storytelling is so compelling, the characters so larger than life, the love story so affecting and the energy so propulsive that I didn't mind swimming in the sheer excess. Heck! Baahubali is meant to leap across a 50-metre abyss, catapult 100 metres over walls and he is a way better than archer than Legolas! I believe everything!I apologise for the excessive use of exclamation marks but this movie earns them, and please allow me to drop a few more. This is frigging cinema! This is the reason I love going to the theatres and once in a while I love getting totally stoned out of my senses with the possibilities of cinema!",

There is much more to the film than just this .Many of you won't believe me, but trust me, I have watched it and can vouch for it !! The Plot: The story continues from where it left off in Part one. The heir to the throne of the mighty Mahishmati empire, prince Amarendra Bahubali (Prabhas) along with Katappa ( Sathyaraj) are sent on a covert mission to mix with the subjects and get to know them better. During their travels Bahubali meets Devsena ( Anushka Shetty) , princess of Kuntal Rajya and falls in love with her. Unknown to him BhallalDeva ( Duggubati) along with his father ( Nassar) are busy planning Bahubali's downfall .They succeed in doing so by creating a misunderstanding between his godmother Sivagami(Ramya) and prevent him from ascending the throne . Ballaldeva is instead made king and along with his scheming father forces Bahubali out of the palace. Amerandra Bahubali meets a tragic end at the hands of his mentor Katappa (won't reveal the plot or I will be roasted alive by die hard fans who still haven't read about it on the WhatsApp messages going viral !!).The rest of the story focuses on the present where Bahubali's son, Mahendra joins hands with evergreen Katappa ( Omg !! the guy is still alive and kicking after all this while .. a true Bhishma Pitamaha of the story !!) to fight the antagonist BhallalDeva, avenge his fathers death and finally regain the throne of Maheshmati.The story is nothing new \u0085 we all knew how it would end \u0085all hunky dory . Everyone goes home happy happy!! Cast: The Protagonist / Antagonist duo Prabhas and Duggubati are well matched adversaries and the climax is a visual treat even though it has been stretched a bit. Prabhas done a great job and has a lot of \"seeti bajao\" moments throughout the film especially the one when he mount an elephant by stepping on its trunk.We know that it is all VFX but yet enjoy and savor the moment.Nassar as Bhallaldeva's father is nice with a Shakuni mama kind of look to his character.Again, VFX used to create his crippled arm is amazing !! Anushkha Shetty as the feisty Devsena and Ramya as Sivagami , the de-facto ruler of Mahishmati have very strong and well etched out characters . Their confrontation scenes hold you in awe and steal the thunder from their male counterparts. A rare achievement not often seen in Indian cinema!! Tammanna, unfortunately doesn't have anything much and is seen only in a handful of scenes .Why you should watch it on the big screen only: It is very rare that you get to see an Indian movie laden with such amazing special effects. It gives an Amar Chitra Katha type of feel to the whole story which indeed refreshing. The whole look is pleasing to the eye with innovative action scenes, awesome costumes and lavish sets . I loved the movie \u0085 total paisa vasool even though it is far far away from reality but then that's how Indian films are supposed to be \u0085 aren't they !!!! Go watch it and enjoy the glory of Bahubali unfold !!",

            "content": "The biggest Indian release of the year and, arguably, one of the biggest films of all times released this weekend across the globe to mammoth expectations. The phenomena that is 'Baahubali 2: The Conclusion' has come to shatter box office records 2 years after its predecessor dominated. I don't often write about numbers as they don't speak to a film's true value but in this case it's all worth noting. Released in 4+ languages 'Baahubali: The Beginning' was the highest box office opener of its time (the record is being broken as I write this). Shot over a period of 4 years with a budget of 450+ crores, these 2 movies had the power to make or break the visionary director and producers. Fortunately, the former happened.Baahubali 2 picks up right after the first film with Kattappa finally revealing Baahubali's fate. The question still looms, \"Kattappa ne Baahubali ko kyun maara.\" The answer, explained over the course of the movie, is heartbreaking. While the narrative in the first film took time to unfold, here our senses are overloaded right from the get-go. If you've seen the 1st movie I don't have to explain much. For those who haven't, these are fantasy films based in ancient times where men are Gods and grandeur rules. This is a tale that spans generations- love runs deep, vengeance even deeper, a young village lad becomes king, and kings become demons. I'm not going into specifics because who am I to spoil the director's masterpiece.S.S. Rajamouli is well known for his unique and brilliant mind having put out countless entertainers in the past. However, he will forever be known as the man behind Baahubali. The scale is massive! In particular, the coronation scene and war sequences are jaw dropping. The budget isn't as large as Hollywood movies (the comparison would be futile) but for what the makers are working with the result is astounding. The beauty also lies in the fact that you're very invested in the story. Rajamouli has a tight grip on his screenplay and embellishes each scene with rich detail. Multiple dialogue writers have worked to make sure the story flows in whichever language you prefer. I watched the Hindi version and was thoroughly entertained by crackling lines like, 'yeh mera vachan hai, mera vachan hi hai shashan' \u2013 'this is my promise, my promise is the law.'This franchise made overnight superstars of its cast and rightfully so. Prabhas who plays Baahubali and Shiva enacts his parts with aplomb. Rana Daggubati, the evil Bhallaladeva, is rotten to the core and Rana is fiercely devoted to the role. His shear stature shows menace. In a breath of fresh air, the women are powerful; they stand their ground and dictate the narrative. While the men show brawn, the women show brains. Anushka Shetty (Devasena) and Ramya Krishnan's (Sivagami) work is applaudable. And who can forget the loyal to a fault Kattappa enacted by Sathyaraj. Everyone would want a companion like him\u0085or would they?This is an epic movie whose sheer audacity is mesmerizing. It's larger than life and over the top but proudly self aware. What fun! It was a joy to experience on the big screen and proved that, sometimes, sequels can be bigger and better. Baahubali 2 shows what filmmakers can accomplish with the right vision. I'm eager to see others taking inspiration from this because creativity has no limits.",

            "content": "Bahubali 1 success had created a monstrous hype around this one and given the history of Indian movies, one would think that this one would fall short of it. But Bahubali 2 doesn't just live up to the hype but exceeds the magnanimity of the first. Story (10/10): Besides answering the million dollar question, the story is amazingly well written with great twists and turns that keep you at the edge of your seat even with a predictable climax. A large part of the story revolves around the build up of Amarendra Bahubali and Devsena's love story and the conspiracy of Bhallaladeva that eventually culminated in Katappa killing Bahubali. While, for some time, especially in Bahubali-Devsena love story build up, you feel the movie is a bit of drag but the writers ensured that every part of the movie had its significance, realized sooner or later. Besides the main story, the story also threw light on some of the wrongs that went on in the ancient (and for that matter, even today) Indian society through a strong character of Devsena challenging such customs and fighting for equality - with support from Amarendra Bahubali. Acting (10/10): Prabhas was great to watch in projecting the character of Amarendra Bahubali - the swag, the commitment, the wrath and the innocence. Not even an inch of overacting to be effective. However, it was Anushka Shetty, with the role of Devsena, who almost stole the movie from Prabhas and kind of ran away with it. Together with Prabhas, she gave very convincing action scenes in terms of expressions and postures - something to watch out. Ramya Krishnan, playing Rajmata Shivagami, had a larger role to play and was very impressive. Her ability to express effectively with her eyes set her apart from the rest of the cast. Rana Daggubati was great playing a politically smart guy. Unfortunately, he only had the climax in his pocket to show some action and flex his muscles but the audience probably didn't miss that with action loaded for Prabhas and Anushka Shetty. Sathyaraj had a difficult role to play in terms of nature - a slave as well as a Godfather (of Mahendra Bahubali). He had his moments as, in a way, he was center to everything that was happening in the movie, and was effortless in delivering a great performance.Direction (10/10): Making a seemingly predictable movie entertaining for almost 3 hours is a colossal task and S. S. Rajamouli pulled it off in style. The conceptualization of scenes, the graphics and especially the brilliant climax showed the class of Rajamouli. His ability to make every single minute of the movie count was exceptional and something that rest of the directors need to learn. His use of introductory credits to provide a quick recap of the story in the form of sculptures was impressive and innovative. He didn't miss out on a very subtle Jallikattu reference too which created quite a stir in the country. His research on ancient war techniques was good from what was shown in the movie - even though a few of them were kind of over the top. Overall, great direction and full entertainment lifted the movie to the next level.Overall (10/10): A must watch and one of the rare kinds of a movie in the current times that had so much entertainment value.",

            "content": "Bahubali 2 review :The two year long wait is finally over! The bedazzling first part of SS Rajamouli's 'Bahubali' (2015) gets a befitting sequel which is not only bigger in scale, better in execution but more importantly, spectacular in vision.A direct sequel to the first part - which ended with the loyal soldier Kattappa's (Sathyaraj) shocking revelation that he killed the valiant Amarendra (Prabhas in dual role as baap-beta Baahubali) - the film carries forward the story of Amarendra Bahubali who is designated heir to the Maheshmati throne by the reigning Raajmata Sivagami (Ramya Krishnan).Bahubali travels to a neighbouring kingdom where he wins the heart of its princess Devasena (Anushka Shetty) by pretending to be a village bumpkin. This love track, though utterly unconvincing and distracting, serves as catalyst for a political conspiracy hatched by rival cousin Bhallal Deva (Rana Daggubati) and his jealous father (Nassar) to overthrow Bahubali as the to-be king.Even with a simplistic plot, Rajamouli manages to hold your attention throughout not allowing you to glance even once at your mobile to check that random message. The audience in the South Mumbai single screen I visited, was reacting uproariously with whistles and claps to every action scene - from Bahubali taming a wild elephant to the stampede of bulls with flaming horns and the ground shattering (literally!!) climactic encounter between Beta Bahubali and Bhallal Deva. Peter Hein, take a bow!On the tech front, the CGI and VFX are a further improvement over the rich legacy left by the prequel. The grandeur of Maheshmati city and the opulence of the palatial sets are awe-inducing. Musically though, the movie falls short as none of the songs pass muster. The fantasy song on a flying ship has a Disney hangover.The performances are first rate. Prabhas and Rana Daggubati are absolutely convincing as the warring cousins. Ramya Krishnan, getting the meatier part than the other two female leads, is simply outstanding. Sathyaraj as Kattappa, is effective in the emotional as well as a few comic moments he gets during Bahubali's courtship with Devasena. Anushka Shetty does well in her wide role transcending from a beautiful princess to a Rakhee like revenge seeking maa. Tamannah Bhatia is hardly there in the film.It's to Rajamouli's credit that he has not let the pressure to replicate the astounding success of 'Bahubali - The Beginning' get to him and has not compromised on his mega vision in any way. Also, he has efficiently linked every event from the prequel right till the Shiv linga which was placed beneath a waterfall in first part getting a proper culmination in this concluding chapter.Ultimately, Bahubali is a cinematic marvel - a franchise which India needs to showcase to the world. As for that nagging question since last two years \"Why Kattappa killed Bahubali\", please rush to the nearest cinema with friends and family and find out for yourself!!Regards,\nSumeet Nadkarni.",

Baahubali 2 caters to the expectations of Typical telugu movie fans only",

It is watchable as entertainment, but if you look into for more interesting with twist or highly appreciated fight scenes, or something new you definitely be disappointed.3 of four portions of movie having only flashback and last fourth portion we realized that is hurry to wrap / conclusion the story.we cant get some answers like, why not Devsena made try to escape from her imprisonment since 25 years, as she was courageous fighter woman, Difference in age between Bhallal and son of Bahubali is 25 years but we see them equal age and equal fight ? How possible this with a 50 years old and a 25 years person ? Big tasks like stopping a mad elephant with a big wooden building, fleeing over coconut tree with wrapping soldiers with shield of metal, uprooting huge trees and many unbelievable things are not digestible in story line, even this is fantasy.Overall this movie is not to mark up to Hollywood movies like '300' or '300 returns'. The big success of the movie is only done by strategical marketing and 'kattapa ne knyu mara'.I suggest this movie to watch only for entertainment but keep mind at home with not much expectations.",

            "content": "Baabhubali 2 has finally arrived, after a 2 year wait. Yes, this was my most anticipated film of the year. I had high hopes and expectations from this film. And it delivered in each and every way possible.Plot: Kattappa tells Shivudu about his heritage by the story of his father, Amarendra Baahubali.Story and Direction: If you basically go in to a Baahubali film expecting some Inception like story please don't go. The story is predictable in every way possible. It is actually a mixture of Ramayana and Mahabharatha. I didn't go to see actually a story. I went to see it because of the grandeur and vastness of Baahubali. I went in as a fan of the previous part. Rajamouli has pulled off a film with great finesse. You can see the work that he has put to pull of this masterpiece of this. I saw the Hindi Version of the film. And yes, the dialogues were great too. Although yes, the film went over the top in almost everything. So what!!!! I have only one complaint though: That would be that the face off between Mahendra and Bhallaldeva was cut short. Yes the sequence was well directed. But I wanted that portion of the film to be longer. The main reason this was shorter was because the flashback was little bit too long for me. But that said, I wouldn't say I had a disappointing experience. It was a blast for me.Acting: Prabhas who played dual roles of both father and son was great in both the roles for me. While the father needed the calmness and attitude, the son had the revenge in him. Rana Daggubati was a bad-ass villain. Nassar too was great in his role. Anushka Shetty was apt for the role of Devasena. Nobody could have played it better than her. Ramya Krishnan was the best Rajmata I have ever seen. Sathyaraj as Kattappa had a comic role in the first half, which was quite shocking in a very good way. Subbu Raju as Kumar Verma, was also good. Tamanna hardly had a role in the film which I could forgive.Music: M M Keeravani's music was par excellence. The background score was also had excellence written all over the tunes. I can't actually pinpoint a song that I didn't like in this film.Other departments: As I said before, the flashbacks needed a little more editing from my side to adjust for the finale act. The cinematography was good. The VFX was great, if not, excellent. Action choreography was also good.Favorite Scene: It would be the scene where Devasena is bought to trial after cutting the fingers of Sethupathi. Baahubali comes to the rescue and brings his brand of justice. I was in awe in that scene.Verdict: Baahubali 2 for me was a visual treat. It ticked marked all the check boxes for me for a perfect film. As I said, I wanted the final act to be a little longer. If I was to select between the 2 films of Baahubali, I can't actually select one. Both were perfect for me.I am going to go with a 9/10.",

            "content": "Movie: Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (UA)Rating: 5/5BAAHUBALI THE BEGINNING took entertainment and Indian cinema both to new heights. So obviously it raised the expectations from BAAHUBALI THE CONCLUSION. And undoubtedly, the conclusion lives up to every expectation and proves to be rather better than the Beginning. Largely because here we have every good element needed for a perfect film, present in this film. I watched the film twice on the big screen. Such great films should be seen on the big screen and not on pirated prints. BAAHUBALI THE CONCLUSION is a perfect film which defines Indian cinema and culture. This isn't just a film, it's a grand celebration that must be celebrated at theatres. We don't get to see such great films daily. This film is really better than the Beginning because it offers more intensity, emotion, high voltage action, splendid visuals and goosebumps-inducing sequences. Even while watching it second time, I got goosebumps in certain sequences. This is really an unmissable family entertainer. There's no vulgarity or obscenity in this film. Kids can definitely watch and enjoy this film.The best part of the film is...the entire film! I can't describe in words how entertaining this film is and it's really hard to choose only one or two scenes as favourite. SS Rajamouli proves himself yet again, along with his entire team. Every single character will be remembered in the history of Indian Cinema. Besides, there's a lot of creativity visible in BAAHUBALI THE CONCLUSION. From the beginning to intermission to the end: each and every scene is 100% engaging and wonderfully shot. The action sequences are very enjoyable and perfectly executed. This is really the BEST action film ever, ever, ever.The visuals are breathtaking. Splendid and presented with sharp details, the visual effects make you fall in love with the film. Prabhas is as entertaining and excellent as usual. Rana Daggubati is excellent in his role. As a character you'll hate him but as an actor you'll salute him. Anushka Shetty impresses big time. Sathyaraj...I mean what an actor! His performance is absolutely perfect. The music is really good and will stay with you for long. Cinematography too deserves a special mention for capturing this film in an excellent way. And how can one forget to praise the writer Vijayendra Prasad, who wrote this epic? Just praising won't do. A big salute!!!!!Undoubtedly, BAAHUBALI THE CONCLUSION is the best film of Indian Cinema. If you liked the beginning, you'll definitely like the conclusion. Even if you didn't, you'll love this part. And I loved both. The Conclusion however is, as I said before, better than the Beginning. Come on, now don't look at the negative reviews and watch this film in theatres with your family. And after watching it twice in theatre, I'm thinking about a third watch too...",

In scenarios like this, I fail to understand the point of a movie. The CGI is really bad. The movie for me was a combination of an animation movie and fight scenes from Ramayana/Mahabharata.Despite having unrealistic action sequences and a story that clearly has no plot, the movie has been marketed as a serious action movie. That is pathetic. I think a kid can direct a better movie than this. Don't waste your time and energy watching this movie. You will probably be ruining your weekend.",

            "content": "My share of two cents to the existing buzz that this film is making. No spoilers so anyone can read. SS Rajamouli concluded this franchise on a sound note with rip roaring performances and a true magnum opus production. SSR has well understood the expectations pinned to this movie, from its first instalment and delivered or rather should say it's a triumph, truly outperforming the first part. Very few movie franchise does that and with Baahubali 2 SSR hits a master stroke. So without spoiling the storyline I have to say this movie has answered all left over things that was lingering in our minds from the previous instalment which includes the million dollar question why Kattapa killed Baaahubali? As on whole this movie delivers substance what it is supposed to and to mention on the strong positives the top score will be the VFX, production design and an engaging screenplay that doesn't make you feel bored even for a minute rather promises goose bumps in so many places. I would be failing my duty if I don't talk about the top notch performances by the entire crew. To be in particular what I felt was the performances by the legendary three stars Ramya Krishna , Sathya Raj and Nasser they were competing each other and outperforming with their acting skills off course I guess this what they call as experience speaks by itself. Prabhas nails the differences precisely between the father and son characters. Anushka's portrayal as Devasena is an ode to brave royal princess of those days. Rana with his etched body delivers the role perfectly. On the production design we have seen movies where grandeur is stuffed without need but period films like this it is important that it is rightly done to hit the right note which was one not so saturating thing about this flick makes us feel sad that it has come to an end and wanting more of it. SSR has broken his own records and made history in historic movie making. Hit the big screens next to you and immerse in the grandeur. Jai Baahubali Jai Magizhmadhi",

It will touch your heart no matter to which age group you belong and whatever gender you are.I bet everyone will find something for them in this movie to appreciate.

The graphics/CGI are OK at most parts. The portrayal of animals though(Elephants, horses, bullocks etc) is cartoonish. Heck, even the trees and the leaves falling at some scenes seem artificial. Gladiator, which was released more than 10 years ago has better CGI. The story-line itself isn't so great. Most of it is taken out of Mahabharata. If you are looking for cringe moments, you got plenty. From soldiers flying around by a swing of a sword, the male chauvinistic attitudes (My favorite being appeasing angry mom/mom-in-law by giving her a grandson), the Southern flavored romance between Prabhas and Anushka with a comic sidekick used as a ploy and the best of all: elastic coconut trees slinging soldiers into the castle and they bouncing off their shields unhurt. You name it, you got it. The only saving grace in the move is Anushka Shetty. All in All, this movie is a bad advertisement to Indian cinema.

Story line could have been better. Especially the reason why Kattappa killed Amrendra Bahubali. 3. Climax was okay-ish. Action sequences too. 4. Some explanations are missing. As mentioned by people earlier. and you can add a few more.But I would still suggest everyone to go and watch it. People are judging this movie on the well set standards by few of the finest people on earth. I could name many Hollywood movies that are worse than this(Thor 2, Tansformers 4, Prometheus etc.). We know you have watched Hollywood movies, but tell me one thing. Was this movie directed by Christopher Nolan? No. In Indian cinema this was the first movie(in the continuation actually so can be considered as second) that is trying to up the game. If you cannot even appreciate the efforts,then just try to go and make a movie yourself and it better be up to the mark set by the Hollywood movies you were talking about. Bahubali is a great movie, you can watch it with family or friends(you might wanna keep away the judges :P ). The dialogues are good, prabhas as amrendra bahubali is great.

            "content": "Bahubali 2: The Conclusion - The mystery about why Amrendra Bahubali was killed by Kattapaa(which i am not gonna discuss obviously) was not that shocking and also a little Predictable while you were watching the movie , but its pretty Satisfactory , no doubt about it. But lets not talk about it.Bahubali duo-logy has came out as a series India could be proud of. Because here we are not competing to achieve something which Hollywood has already done , rather its about making us better in our own territory. Thats what make it awesome. An average American person can watch Krish or Raavan and say \"why should we watch Bollywood movies like this, Hollywood does it better\" . But that same person cant say the same thing about Bahubali. Because Bahubali is not just visual extravaganza , its down to earth , close to our culture , not trying to copy anything . And i can say S.S. Rajamouli is the only director i think who could have done it(or may be SHANKAR can do it too someday). Because to make a movie like this you have to be both A VISIONARY and also CLOSE TO YOUR CULTURE.Everything becomes grander in this movie. Action, emotions , visuals , dialogues. And Rajamouli did everything with style. Which mostly good but sometimes bad. I would like to state that the climax battle was not as good as the Bahubali The Beginning . The reason being very specific and simple is that they concentrated more on power then strategy. Why i liked the action in Bahubali The Beginning is because of the strategies Amrendra Bahubali used because of lack of resources he had . But here it was a straightforward fight between Ballaldeva and Mahendra Bahubali. And the person with more Power Won. That Simple. Also there was a very stupid Palm tree sequence which was very badly done. But don't think that the action scenes are not good. Its just that they fall short of Bahubali The Beginning . Also the climax action is just for the last half an hour , while in comparison Bahubali The Beginning has almost the whole second half having action scenes.But except these things everything else is better in Bahubali The Conclusion as compared to Bahubali The Beginning .The female character are the best improvement here. Yes Tammana Bhatia's character was really good in Bahubali The Beginning , but here Anushka Shetty and Ramya Krishnan nailed it as Amrendra Bahubali's wife and mother. They were not side characters , they were strong , sometimes stealing the scenes from male characters. That's actually great considering that Female actresses are just for song and dance in most of the South Indian movies. A small disappointment is that Tammana's character was totally ignored in this movie. Prabhas and Rana gave the best performance of their carrier. You would love to see how Amrendra Bahubali reacted like a child when he see DEVASENA(Anushka) for the first time and fall in love with her. The story-line is not very new if you sit and think about it(which is actually a very difficult thing to do considering that how good the visuals were). Same old family politics we have seen in a lot of movies. And there were not exactly any big twist. Some loopholes too. But the way RAJAMOULI handle the scenes , its like he wants every scene to be shown like never before. And those treatments to the scenes converts the average story-line into something special. There were some problems with the Timeline of the movie too. This movie didn't able to fill-up each and every gap the first movie teases earlier. But that's not gonna bother you if you will not thing too hard. It also will be better if you watch Bahubali The Beginning before watching this. But of coarse its not necessary. There is no logic in discussing the technical department. Everything is great , visuals , cinematography , background score , production design etc. Songs goes with the flow , except one song where the ship begins to flow in the sky. I know this review doesn't matters much. Everybody is gonna watch it. And that's exactly the right thing to do.I had given Bahubali The Beginning 8.5/10. This one is better. So i am going for 8.6/10.By ANuP APu KuMaR..",

The way it is defined it adds stars to her beauty.Bhalal and his father tactics will make you feel everything. Many times in the movie i felt goosebumps.I felt each emotion in it. Hats off to Rajamouli. And to those who think action might be too much in this to them i would like to say, Hollywood movies like wanted/FF8 are too much in action but still we don't see them as too much. I think Bahubali was a character on which this type of action suits. He was thought as a superhero, so please think like that. And before saying anything think from the creativity side.At the end i would say, it's not a movie where you read a review and watch. Just watch and have your own review about it.",

Right from the scene where Bahubali climbs the elephant in an amazing manner, the film and its special effects take off and never look back! Stunning visuals, jaw-dropping stunts and war strategies/tricks make it an experience for a lifetime. I loved every stunt so much that I ended up rewinding almost all of them to watch again!And it doesn't end there. The real specialty of this film yet lies in its plot, combined with the stunts. A touching story that contains turns, twists, 'misunderstandings' and 'evil plotting' that would make Shakespeare proud.For these and many reasons, I've to conclude that at least I've never watched even a Hollywood of the same genre that matches the standards of this epic. Bahubali is one of the greatest legend presented in a film, possibly the ultimate super-hero the world has ever seen!I thought Sharad Kelkar's voice in the Hindi dubbing really suited to the protagonist's character. Was it him? I guessed the voice.A minor criticism though. The end-war was too mainstream and the kind of fight we see in every other Bollywood film. I'd have ideally shown Bahubali just run away with the show with his usual great war strategies. Yes, some tricks were still shown even there, but the film presents the great man in a way from whereon it never befits him to engage in a mainstream war like that. In the favour of the film though, it can be argued that that Bahubali was the father, a man brought up under the royal guidance and special training, whereas the son was brought up as a layman. Either way, I'm not going to extract stars based on that.It deserves 10 stars!",

They have spent as much as any top Hollywood movie on CGI. And finally what came out of it? Let me put it in one word. Crap. Utter crap. Just you average tollywood action flick at 1080p, with some Disney movie animation thrown in for good(?) effect. And some people even bothered to compare this to the lord of the rings,I mean really? Firstly, it came out 16 YEARS AGO, and even still this crap can not even hold a candle against it, which believe me I take no joy in saying. And I don't even want to start with the story(?). A first half that was ...what in the hell was that? The second half had some iota of a plot though. So some vanvas like dilemma drama from ramayan, with a mother instead of the father,due to a cunning shakuni type old man trying to take the kingdom for his sadistic son revolving around a female(mahabharat?)... about sums it up. Such innovation, so much WOW.But I did give it two stars, because some of the supposedly action scenes cracked me up.

            "content": "First of all, I loved watching Baahubali 2 on big screen with maximum sound effects. Grossing 1000+ crore ($150 million) worldwide and set out to cross 5000 crore collections easily in its entire run, Baahubali is undoubtedly the biggest film ever produced in India. The fact that this movie is embraced by Indians and foreigners alike shows that it's not just a regional Telugu or Indian but a global film as it's purely based on human emotions. The music has has more longevity in BB2's songs and the lyrics are haunting in nature compared to BB1. After completely watching the movie, I was awestruck with no words to describe it. No doubt, SS Rajamouli is a master craftsman as they call him Jakkanna.If we watch Baahubali 1 & 2 back to back it makes complete sense as both are written in such a way that the beginning is actually the conclusion and vice versa. Also, in the first and second parts of the movie, everything comes full circle, so I watched part 1 again, a day before watching part 2. Since, Baahubali 1 was very good with intense emotions,I highly recommend to watch BB1 again before watching BB2. First scene in BB1 where Sivagami saving her grandson above her over head and and sinking into the river which is very near the end of BB2 and that connection awesome.Rajamouli made sure that the emotions are taken to epic proportions as he did in his all films but a bit higher in this movie.The strong female characters Sivagami, Devasena, and Avanthika are the backbones of the film while male characters like Kattappa, Bhallaladeva, Bijjaladeva, and Kumara Varma strongly support the two lead characters Amarendra Bahubali and Mahendra Bahubali (Sividu). Epic wars and Drama are the two pillars of the movie. The visual effects are stunning but some scenes where Bahubali Jr. and sena jumps off the palm trees on kota and head of Bhallaladeva's statue rolling off the river need fine tuning from VFX team (may be due to lack of time or budget) wherein I suspended my disbelief as compared to overall effect the small detail is not so important. However, these CGI effects would be remastered when the film is released on DVD, I hope.It has great music, great cinematography, great story.Production values are great too.. special mention to the world-class production designer Saabu Cyril that contributed to the scope and scale and director's ambition to make a international standard movie. Scale of this movie is on par with Lord of the rings. Costumes designed by Rama Rajamouli aptly suit the characters and vivid in colors.This epic finally has answers to all burning questions including the popular questions asked by everyone after watching the beginning \"Why Kattappa killed Amarendra Baahubali?\" was answered in the conclusion with complete justification.Spoiler Alert..As far as the story line goes, as soon as the next king of Mahishmathi is announced by Sivagami, the conflict starts among Bijjaladeva and Bhallaladeva and that leads to exile of Amarendra Baahubali and his murder there by Mahendra Baahubali's revenge on Bhallaladeva.Some scenes involving Bijjala and Bhallala show egos and political conspiracies to maximum level of dark side of their characters. Bijjaladeva character is very deceptive and manipulative. On the lighter side, Subbaraju's character shows some comic relief. Devasena's character played by Anushka is very dignified. Bhallaladeva becoming evil even if he resists Bijjaladeva's plan to kill Sivagami in the beginning but goes on to stab Bahubali several times and also tries to kill newborn shows that the character is deliberately designed as evil. Kunthala kingdom is very beautiful with greenery while Mahishmati is more deserty reddish that shows great contrast.Movie has creative war machines like chariot with propellers, weapons, war tactics that have never been seen before in any movies. The fact that the movie is made in the budget of 35 million dollars and still shows so much grandeur when compared to the big budget Hollywood movies is very commendable.This is the best thing ever created and is my top 5th movie of all time (Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, Avatar, Titanic, Baahubali). An extremely satisfying conclusion where lot of thing come full circle!I liked the awesome intro scene with recap of the part 1 with statues story which brings back old memories of BB1 and brought me back into the world of Baahubali in no time.Movie shows different parts of kingdoms (Mahishmathi and Kunthala) and characters and each of them have their own arcs, their motivations and intentions. It also has lot of Indian cultural references like both Sivagami and Devasena carrying fire .. evil Bhallaladwvas death toward end exciting revenge on evil.Handling of #WKKB is awe inspiring and the Kattappa's character abiding to law, duty, and obligation is very well defined as he always does what is right.Pacing is super solid from start to finish, including the prolonged action sequences which never cause any boredom as the characters change the games in the war.Some of the scenes I like very much are:Fantastic dream sequence in hamsa nava song is visually great . Every song lyrics are made integral part of the story Over the top action like Hercules is more of mythological. Intro of Devasena portrait as equivalent to sending a selfie in today's time.Overall, Baahubali - The Conclusion is an entertainingly grand movie. This movie is perfect than perfect. Stunning awesome blockbuster!! My rating is 10 on the scale of 10.. Wish I could give more rating!! :)",

            "content": "Baahubali-2 takes off right where the Baahubali - The beginning ended, with the now famous question... Why Kattappa killed Baahubali? The story feels much more coherent now that the loose ends are tied really well.There is so much more to the story of Baahubali than the WKKB question. The story takes us through the Love blooming between Amarendra Baahubali and Devasena, then delves into the Politics in the Mahishmathi Kingdom and some shocking revelations ensure the pace is kept high and then comes the sequence of Kattappa killing Baahubali. From then, the story becomes predictable and turns into a clich\u00e9d revenge drama. But the greatness of SS Rajamouli as a top- notch technician of the movie lies in how well he keeps the audience engaged and absorbed into the story. The entire narrative of Baahubali has been fleshed out and the emotions are handled very well indeed. The sequence of Kattappa and Baahubali has been used for maximum dramatic effect.Wherever there are no strong emotions to keep us focused, Rajamouli resorts to Visuals.A separate mention has to go to the Visuals of the movie. The movie is visually stunning. So stunning indeed that it is one of, if not the most beautiful Indian film so far. Every frame of it oozes grandeur. Some of the sequences, especially the Visuals of the Romance song between Devasena and Baahubali match the standards of Hollywood. No doubt about it.However, that is where the comparison with Hollywood must end, in all fairness. The movie is Indian at its core and the story, which heavily draws inspiration from the famous characters of Maha Bharatha is not new to the audience. It is an age old tale of Sibling Rivalry set in a different world and its saving grace are the great characters that populate the world of Baahubali. The actors have done a great job with stellar performances from Anushka, Satyaraj, RamyaKrishna, Nasser and Rana. They all acted very well. But ultimately it is Prabhas that steals the show. His performance is apt, controlled and is almost always on point. He never over-does his role.All the technicians that have worked for the film have done a fabulous job as well. The music by MM Keeravani is wonderful and his BGM takes the experience to new heights. Senthil Kumar's cinematography is another big plus for the movie.The pacing of the movie is amazing but it falters towards the end, as what happens becomes predictable and in the final battle, the viewers are treated at the same time to wonderful visuals and clich\u00e9s. However, the events leading to the climax more than make up for it. Ultimately the ending is a safe one and the final sequence neatly ties it to the beginning of the first movie. Very sublime.Finally, Baahubali is today's blockbuster, tomorrow's classic and is definitely one of the most important films for Indian movie industry. Watch it for the Visuals and Rajamouli's superb narration. It is an Indian film with an Indian story and is suffused with Indian sensibilities. That makes it a breathe of fresh air.",

And this time the movie shined in a new light.Much ballyhoo had been made about the VFX and graphics in the movie - not that they aren't nice, but they're really not what drives this movie. It's about the story.It's a simple story - good prevails evil. But the brilliance lies in the way the events unfold and the way Rajamouli has orchestrated the entire flow. I thought the first part of the second half is a master class in storytelling - all the events and sequences leading up to Sivagami escaping are so cleverly sequenced that the tension and emotions build and build and build till one is completely immersed head and heart into the characters.Overall it's rare for a movie to bring all these diverse cinematic elements and plot ploys so well. I felt like many stories from Indian classics were partially references , making it so easy to connect with.So the verdict is, it's still strongly moving even on multiple watches.-----+--+------------Very rarely comes a movie that pushes the boundaries of possibility - a magical journey that transports your imagination to an elevated world of wonder. Baahubali - the conclusion belongs to that rarefied league.SS Rajamouli has created a spectacle that will be the gold standard for future Indian cinema to aspire to. The VFX are stupendous, the choreography and action pieces jaw dropping spectacular, and every single frame is stamped with perfection. Take a bow Sabu Cyril and the entire crew for pure cinematographic alchemy. I had a chance to watch the movie in IMAX and am glad I did because of the scale of this epic.The plot is stupendous, replete with royal politics, intrigue, betrayal, fear, hope, courage and more courage. The dialogues and interactions kept me hooked. The background score of the movie is amazing and dials up the impact by a factor of 11. I read 'he Rise of Sivagami' before watching the movie and it's really fascinating how the story flows so tightly between the two movies and the book. And no praise is complete without talking about the stupendous performances. Prabhas soars as Amrendra Baahubali and as Shivudu. He slips into the characters with aplomb - effortlessly regal and inspiring as one, and believably impetuous yet heroic in the other. Rana is convincingly sinister and a formidable antagonist. Sivagami, Bijjaladeva, Kattappa all have very strong character realization in this part. However Anushka Shetty steals the thunder as Devasena - she was a spark kept simmering and hidden in the first part, and now she explodes into the narrative-bending blaze in the conclusion.There is a dignity, a magical quality in every minute of the film, that separates it from all other movies. Director Rajamouli has created the world and tale of Baahubali with such passion, effort and devotion, that it will continue to inspire movie makers and moviegoers for a long, long time.",

Hope of seeing improved movie making, hope for better CGI and hope for good script, with all the money they had in their hand.

Acting - Average. As per the expectation I went in with (which was low).Action - Badly choreographed every where, except for one scene.VFX - In very few scenes VFX is good. But every other scene (which is 98%) of the movie, you can see CGI miles away.Songs - Never cared for songs. As usual it was not needed wherever it was.Comedy - You might smile in 2-3 comedy sketches in first half but smile will fade away pretty quickly and you won't remember any of those as soon as you come out of theater.

Prima facie, quite a lot of thought seems to have gone into writing the screenplay and fine tuning every scene, because of which the action and dramatic set pieces are awe inspiring. I don't wish to write about them, as I don't want to be a spoil sport. The director pleasantly surprised me by fleshing out Kattappa's role and peppering it with a lot of humor, which gave the proceedings a lot of levity and fun. My gripe with The Conclusion: The part that I loved the most in The Beginning was the war scene in the second half, which lasted for close to 3 quarters of an hour. There are no such extended orgasm inducing battle scenes, this time around. There are a lot of sequences that have been shot in the dark, and consequently, had much less of an impact on me. Also, the graphics seemed kind of tacky. It looked like a perfect example of the bigger not necessarily being the better.",

(Only because of this scene, many people watched this film 2 times.)3) Devsena was seen very beautiful.3) Locations were superb, Music was energetic and 'Mahishmati Anthem' will definitely gives you goosebumps.4) Whole movie is based on the 2 major characters - (Amrendra Bahubali and Devsena) *BAD-1) Poor Graphics(CGI) or VFX, really VFX are not that great, and can be easily judge-able.2) Climax was a major disappointment for all he viewers- I mean how can they cross Giant Mahishmati Kingdom by just Coconut or Banana Trees. This is definitely impossible. OK Let we consider this, they cross and enters in the kingdom, Now, how can they beat all the soldiers in the Mahishmati, I mean, Mahendra Bahubali attacked Mahishmati with some villagers and wins. This is Insane !3) Devsena is very Mature, Intelligent and Kind Hearted,Inspite, she continuously keep Insulting 'Shivgami' in-front of the whole Kingdom, not a single time, but every time whenever she meet her, she keeps insulting her. There is simply no need to insult her in some scene. 4) Some action scenes are impossible. One can easily judge the VFX work, and the VFX sucks, not that great.5) In the first part, Mahendra Bahubali's character was shown very Strong, but in this, he is shown weak enough, except for Climax.6) Bhallaldeva was shown silent most of the times.7) Disappointed from Kattappa, when shivgami orders him to kill baahubali, he easily convinced to kill, ( is this was his true love towards bahubali ? ) He can simply cut his throat instead of killing baahubali or he can leave Mahishmati Kingdom and lives with Baahubali.8) Tammanna Bhatia's role was very very very small, i don't understand why she didn't get some more role, she was seen rarely in 2 or 3 scenes. (Really disappointing)9) Climax, the director ends up movie very fast, don't know why he ended the movie that much fast.",

Not being an avid follower of Telugu movies, I didn't know much about any of the cast, let alone the director S.S. Rajamouli. But boy I was wrong, so wrong to have doubted the movie. I loved it and till now watched it more than 10 times.It did tremendous in box office, but became a all-favorite cult classic during these last three years. Every single Indian film-lovers waited eagerly for this movie. So, naturally I had high hopes about The Conclusion. And I have to say, I loved every single frame of this movie. S.S. Rajamouli's direction was even better in this one, as everyone's eyes were glued to the screen in the theater.Laudable work done by the Editing Team, unlike Baahubali: The Beginning, The Conclusion didn't had a single redundant scene, every side plot had a reason to be in the screenplay. The songs were really mellifluous, and I bet it sounded better in Telugu than Hindi. If you haven't seen it yet and thinking it's not worth of your time, it's okay. But don't make the mistake of thinking it's a typical Telugu movie. It's unlike anything you've seen before, a masterpiece. The Box Office will say the rest.",

The story is weak and predictable.Half of the action scenes are so unrealistic I was laughing, but rest of them were really great involving hand to hand combat. I am really upset that they degraded katappa's character and made him a comic relief for the first half.

Nice logic.-ASOKA and Jodha Akbar and Krrish have better picturised songs than the Disney cartoon in Bahubali 2.The movie is a overblown, overrated, over-hyped loud mess compared to the great first part.

The climax is disappointing .One would expect a proper face off between bhallaldeva and bahubali.However it appears that the makers were in a hurry to wrap up the movie in the limited amount of screen timing. The only notable praiseworthy factors about the movie are the graphics and special effects . The director has put a significant amount of effort for the grandeur of the project. However he could have chosen a better way of storytelling and mostly a mature plot ,given the gargantuan effort (in terms of time and money) involved with the film And as I have anticipated, the movie is not up to the mark, at least surely not as much as it flashed all around.There are good movies, there are great movies. But good movies hyped as great movies actually always fall short of expectations and become average movies, that's what exactly happened here.The plot is weak, predictable, and similar to any South Indian movie where the protagonist goes through hardships, someone gets murdered, and someone seeks revenge. Too many South Indian melodramatic movies have the same story line. The movie is completely hyped.In brief, at least I expected the ending scenes will deliver something better.

            "content": "That is all I could think of after watching Baahubali 2: The Conclusion. This movie is as inane, insincere and random as the first part was magnanimous and awe-inspiring. In the first part, because we saw the boy Shivudu do gloriously impossible tasks, we believed that he is truly deserving of the name \"Baahubali\", but in the second part, it was like, because his name is Baahubali he felt a compelling need to do impossible and logic-defying tasks. When I looked for reviews of this movie, I found the first 4 pages here filled with negative reviews yet I don't know how this movie can still get a rating of 9/10. Impossible. Unbelievable. The industry critics whose reviews have been so accurate in the past that I felt like giving them a Pulitzer, are going ga-ga over this sorry excuse for an epic movie that is Baahubali 2. Unbelievable. Movie industry people and movie pundits calling it a legend with unprecedented gloriousness in terms of VFX and plot-progression drawing parallels to epics like LOTR. Unbelievable. The characters which were endearing or formidable in the first movie are laughable and obnoxious in the second. Unbelievable. The story which was about a simple yet gifted boy coming to face his destiny which unbeknownst to him was connected to a past that seemed gloriously epic in proportions and alluringly complex became a simple conspiracy of 2 men in which everything else (including the Supremely revered Queen Mother - Shivagami, The formidable Antagonist - Aging BhallalDeva, the handicapped yet crafty and scary Uncle who was perfectly distorted and complex version of Dhritarashtra - BijjalaDeva, the persistent guerrilla rebel group, the woman who sheds all feminity for becoming a warrior and crusader against injustice \u2013 Avanthika, the upright and powerful Kingsguard with unwavering allegiance to the royal family- Kattappa and the awe-inspiring entity of the nation - Mahishmati ) was but a wallpaper. What got a run-time were the idiotic antics of Kattappa and Amarendra in Kuntala Kingdom that were meant to be comedic but ended up looking nonsensical; and the beautiful-beyond-words warrior-princess falling in love with a hapless buffoon. Unbelievable. Everything about this movie is unbelievable in the worst possible way.",

The film is technically too high, the Director made sure that, every scene should have left some impact on the Audience. The film is itself a History.I can't generalize single actor because from small to big, everyone did their part Fabulously except Tamaana, she couldn't fit in the film.Music is good,among all 'the krishna' song is too hearable. Background score is also perfect, you can't accept any better.#WKKB part was breathtaking , you will be able to feel every word. The sets VFX everything is Eye-catching.

            "content": "Baahubali is everything what I love in cinema and salute to Rajmouli and the entire team for telling this story in this mind blowing way. I cannot get over it. I watched Telugu and Hindi versions, Sharad Kelkars voice for Baahubali takes \"dubbing\" to a whole new level. When was the last time a dubbed movie dialogue gave you goosebumps? The work done on dubbing is unparalleled and no wonder the Hindi audience has loved it and appreciated it so much. Kudos. Having said that and having watched the Telugu version too,I feel that there is something lost in translation. Especially the songs, the powerful lyrics of Dandalayya are not conveyed properly in Jay Jay Kara. In Hamsa Navva it says \"Mecchindile Devasena\", which means Devasena approves - just shows the strong character of Devasana which gets lost in \"Bas Teri hai Devasena\" and very powerful last lines in Sahore Bahubali:- \" Anta Maha Baludainaa, Amma vodi pasivaade Shivudainaa, Bhavudaiyna, ammaku saati kaadantaade\" That cannot control tears are just non-existent in Hindi. Even The war cry \"Heysa Rudrasa, Heysarabhadra Samudrassa\" in the song is toned down by translation. I am not trying to find flaws, the Hindi songs in isolation are wonderful and A-class but you will do yourself a great favor if you watch this movie in its original Telugu language glory and trust me even if you don't understand the language, you will cherish the experience. Yes the story is inspired from our epics of Ramayan, Mahabharata or even Lion King but who cares. The presentation is awesome, the story telling is awesome and it touches your hearts. There were multiple scenes where the audience ruptured into thunderous applause and that's the magic of cinema. I am amazed to see the plethora of negative reviews. To each his own but most of the bad reviews appear from jealous folks. Ignore these reviews, Baahubali doesn't merit any reviews. Baahubali 2 is an experience to cherish. Watch it on big screen, ideally a single screen with crazy crowd. Cherish it, because it will be years before something like this comes out of India. Cherish it because it is the victory of regional Indian cinema. It has broken the stale stereotypes of Bollywood and rewritten history. Salute once again to Rajamouli, Keeravani, Prabhas, Rana, Anushka, Ramya Krishna, Nasser, Sathyaraj, Tammanah and everyone else in the Baahubali team. Not just the Telugu states, but we all Indians are proud of you!",

Irritating songs start anytime just like the first version. Biggest disappointment was action sequences. All action scenes seem unrealistic, have usual flavor of Bollywood/south Indian movies with typical over usage of slow motion and zero gravity. My genuine rating is 3 out of 10.

U can enjoy it if u indulge in it. Some of them commented that it is a predictable movie. Yes indeed like the Hollywood legendaries Troy, Alexander..etc. It has some negatives like superhuman heroic sequences.

I think The cinematography, CGI visuals is the main component of the film. The cast and crew members of the movie did a great job. I think Prabhas is the best choice for Baahubali no other one can beat him for that role. Darling Prabhas you are superb. You done a great job in your carrier. the chemistry between Prabhas and Anushka are awesome. they look like made for each other. In this film she is much beautiful than her previous films. Other cast including Rana, Ramya Krishna, Tamannaah, Nasser and Sathyaraj performs well and much appreciated. Director SS Rajamouli and Vijeyendra Prasad garu making the film Baahubali the conclusion for a perfect ending story and a perfect entertainer for the audience and I forgot two names, Shobu Yarlagadda and Prasad Devineni of ARKA media works for making this film smoothily.Overall its great visual treat and good movie for all the viewers in the world.

Think it as the Matrix movie, but all the events happen somewhere in India during the middle ages. The movie actually has very beautiful colors and costumes and settings and so on so forth... However it is a compilation of complete cliche. It looks like producers tried to imitate some of the very well known major Hollywood scenes but failed miserably.

I understand it's fiction but still no-one can fight with 10,00,000 people with help of bulls and axes. If you talk about individual performances then it was completely Rana Daggubati & Prabhas show. Ramya Krishnan is a senior and popular actress but she can't speak a single dialogue without opening her eyes wide. There was a character named Kumara Varma who can't fight but when Baahubali gave him his weapon, he started fighting like a gladiator.Action sequences are completely blown out of proportion. If you look at climax scene, audience laughed on that particular scene in theaters. Baahubali should not be called as Greatest Indian Film Ever rather it should be Greatest South Indian Film Ever. Most fans argue that it was visually grand but I agree but where was the plot? Movies like Dhoom 3, Chennai Express and Kick have also done great business widely but these were awful movies. Movies should not be judged on their business.",

First was the some visual effects were not finished, Mostly were well done some were seems badly in bare eyes.. Second was it doesn't spend any time with baahubali junior, for that character development they have to heavily rely on the first film. Third the movie ends suddenly just like that.. action scene finished baahubali on the kings chair and end credits... that seems rushed very much... It should have better if they spend a little bit time more to give us baahubali junior becoming king ceremony....

            "content": "First Published On- https://goo.gl/VrvHNxFirst five minutes of the movie, including the opening credits, are the example of sheer grandeur and massiveness which one is going to experience in the next 160 minutes. It looked like 'The Conclusion' is living up to the hype 'The Beginning' generated two years back. A superb production design, great direction, powerful music and wonderful visuals. It has everything.But as much as the movie is great in its visuals, I can't say the same about the story or the movie as a whole for that matter. First half runs completely in the flashback and sets a backstory which is every bit predictable. Why are we so obsessed with love stories? And it's quite OK to show a love story on screen but it feels bad when the complete first half covers the same without making any significant progress in the story. There was nothing special or grand about it. Either a hero doing larger than life actions to win the heart of the girl or he is playing dumb and his sidekick tries everything to impress the girl for his hero by doing dumber things. The usual Telugu cinema stuff and it is exactly the case here. Songs don't seem to end in first half and a character as strong as Katappa plays a visible sidekick, which is saddening to see. A little scissor could do a great job.As the movie progresses further and the actual story comes into play, it looked less of a revenge drama and more of a saga of family politics. But again, that plot is still buyable because the movie is still running in flashback only. And then comes the moment the whole country was waiting for- ' Katappa ne Baahubali ko kyon maara?' Although it was not a dramatic revelation as such, it was expected the way movie was progressing. Very underwhelming. Further, when the story comes back into present time and the war breaks out, we see our hero doing gravity-defying stunts, which looks a little bit over-the-top but as it's a fantasy drama, everything is acceptable. So what if it's not a superhero movie? If we can believe our hero crossing mountains hundreds of feet apart, without taking a lesson or two of physics, this time they are at least using the projectile to shoot themselves at the angle of 45 degrees to cover maximum distance.As for the characters, the movie gives every chance for them to develop but they seem to be somehow overshadowed by the powerful aura of Amarendra Baahubali, even the character of his son Mahendra Baahubali played by Prabhas. But it's Anushka Shetty as Devasena, who made her presence felt by her dominating character, which is powerful and the one with no nonsense. Ramya Krishnan as Sivagami Devi is good but seems to be losing her charm in the second half when she falls for conspiracy of his son Bhallala Deva and Husband Bijjala Deva, Rana Daggubati and Nassar respectively. I feel sorry for both of them, great actors but somehow lost in all limelight, especially Nassar. Sathyaraj as Katappa, like the first movie, remains the loving character.It will be stupid to compare it with any Hollywood movie and one should not do that, but it is bound to be compared with its first part. The conclusion is more of a prequel than a sequel, it take us to the origin of Baahubali but when it comes to story, it seems weaker compared to the first part. While you always remain on the edge of your seat in former, later looks predictable. Although it is bigger and grander than the first one, fact remains that it is milking on the success of 'The Beginning'. War sequences were well synchronized there, here they looked chaotic. You can predict quite early in the movie that what is going to be the end, and you get to know in the first part itself that how it is going to be. How your antagonist will die. Many of us even figured out the question of national importance too, 'Why Katappa killed Baahubali?' and all our imaginations and assumptions are finally put to rest.Two-time National award winner S.S. Rajamaoli is a great director, he is a visionary. First, he took non-bollywood cinema to the national audience with Magadheera and Eega. Whatever little work was left, he fulfilled with Baahubali - The Beginning and now with this one he took it to international level.Overall, when you leave the theatre, you know that it's not a perfect movie but it is an entertainer and mostly value for your money, provided you haven't bought a Rs. 1200 gold class VIP ticket. On a brighter side, Baahubali is a celebration of the capacity of Indian quality and standards. It is the result of hard work and dedication of entire cast and crew. It is a living example of the fact that if we get as much budget as a Hollywood movie gets, we can produce some indigenous wonders. I would not say it was a visual masterpiece but it was definitely a visual treat. At least we don't have to set Indian benchmarks of CGI on Chhota Bheem and Bal Ganesha.Baahubali is a kind of movie I would love to watch again in the theatre but just for its visuals and not for its story.",

The first two hours is a prequel, before continuing where 'The Beginning' left of.I enjoyed the first film in its entirety, whereas I only enjoyed about an hour (if that) of this film, with a runtime of nearly 3 hours. I have a lot of issues with this film. The first hour revolves around two brothers' love for the same woman (if one can call it love, actually. For one bother it was love, maybe, but for the other it was simply a competition). The storytelling and script felt immature, the acting silly (even slapstick) and the actors wood-faced and theatrical. The 'love story' was presented in a comedic way - and then they make war over it!! Oh boy, seriously!! Due to the very REASON behind this warfare, I found it utterly ridiculous and not in the least interesting.In their attempts to make the film as impressive as possible, they made it ludicrous. Some of their 'inventive' stunts were laughable instead of amazing. They honestly just tried too hard. The story is filled with conveniences, credibility issues and questionable events. Then there's the visual effects. Wow, for a big budget 2017 film they're really bad! Much of the effects looks animated - and I mean as in animated, not CGI! The visuals during the film's final moments (especially) were cringe worthy.The film is also a bit confusing due to both Mahendra/Shivan and Amarendra Baahubali being played by the same actor (Prabhas) and their appearances being so identical. One should have been able to distinguish them better. Also, are Mahendra and Bhallaladeva human or gods? The things they're capable of are definitely not of human ability.Wait, what??!! The statue's head FLOATS???!!! Even in shallow waters?? What is the statue made of??? Due to the film's idiotic, boring premise and the number of issues, I didn't enjoy this film one bit.",

Final war should have dedicatedly designed for 40 mins with good preparation of war like it happened in part 1. (or) movie should have trimmed 10 mins in the second half ( do not ask me where and how to trim :) ).

The scene in which he beheads the commander of Maheshmati army with his sword is worth standing up and clapping. Anushka Shetty as Devasena has also given a fine performance.

            "content": "Of course, after the albeit flawed but nonetheless spellbinding Baahubali: The beginning, everyone awaited Baahubali 2 the conclusion with gargantuan expectations that are almost never met by sequels.Baahubali 2 not only meats these expectations but gracefully rises way above them.First of all this movie is not something you watch but experience. Rajamouli expertly engrosses us in a fantasy where there is not a second where you will be bored. This movie never dulls, instead it gets you to greater levels of high at the imagination and creativity in which the story is told. This is visual storytelling at its best. The story itself is an amalgamation of well known myths, legends and epics like Mahabharata (Baahu vs Balla for the throne) and Ramayana (Baahubali and devasena exiled), infested with much of the stereotypical Masala clich\u00e9s of Indian cinema. In any normal film this would be cringe worthy , boring and frustrating, but the performances and the grandeur in which the scenes are displayed makes it all believable, and you don't care whether Shivu ripping a tree from its roots or Bahubali throwing a chariot is realistic...because the film dissolves you so deep into the fantasy that its actually entertaining and even cool. Yes there are some faults with the CGI which doesn't look 100% realistic at all times, but considering the taboos of Indian cinema and the technical boundaries and budget restricting them, the VF is groundbreaking. There are some shots which could literally be framed on the wall and it would be absolutely amazing. The war scenes contain the same epic and innovative feel of the first films, but this time with added toppings; a stampede of bulls with fiery horns, human cannonballs (absolutely amazingly shot). It still has the typical \"war\" shots; i.e armies sweeping in masses to fight each other like from Lord of the Rings, but Rajamouli somehow makes it feel just as fresh and jaw dropping as it did in Lord of the Rings, with M.M Keeravani's music elevating it to another epic level.Now, yes yes the visuals are great I get it, but what about the content, the characters, the performances, and most of all the answer to WKKB? like in most epic, VFX driven films, 3-D characters with intense performances and emotionally striking drama is very rare even in Hollywood. But Baahubali 2 has all of it. The political palace drama that plays out in the middle of the film is very intriguing with multi-layered characters with their own inner conflicts and dilemmas. All the actors here give their very best. Prabhas is utterly charming and completely believable as this herculean character, with great chemistry with Anushka (Devasena) who is not your stereotypical submissive woman but can speak for herself and displays prowess as a warrior. With Tammana in the first film it was utterly crap due to Tammana's OTT performance, and thankfully she doesn't appear much in this film. But here, anushka's performance itself is spellbinding enough to give you goosebumps (look out for the poetic scene where baahubali teaches devasena to fire arrows). This brings me to some of my favorite characters in the movie: Ramya Krishnan's powerful and captivating performance as the majestic but conflicted and flawed Sivagami attempting to balance her love for both Balla and Baahu. In the first film there is a brilliant shot where Sivagami has blood splattered on her face, knife in one hand, baby on the other; a defiant, commanding woman capable of violence, yet a nurturing lovable mother. The next shot features her sitting majestically on the throne with both Baha'i and Ball as babies cradled on her lap. The significance of this shot doesn't strike then but it does now and its genius characterization on the work of Rajamouli.Sathyaraj as Kattapa; WOW. wkKB is not exactly the BIG twist you might have been expecting but the whole sequence is very hard hitting and very powerful; I even teared up just a little. The relationship between Bahubali and katappa is further developed in the first half of the film, and when wkKB is revealed in the second half it makes it all the more powerful. sathyaraj completely embodies this Bheeshma-like character who is bound by duty. Nasser's role- a tribute to shakuni- is just plain evil/cunning. It is a brilliantly nuanced performance with a deeper layer; He has his own jealousies, insecurities-Reminds of Fredo from Godfather (although bijjaladeva is nowhere near as stupid). There are a few shockingly disturbing scenes involving Nasser (contemplating killing his own wife,a bloody plan to frame bauble) and it is great!in fact the supporting cast are so great that you get so engrossed in their conflicts that you completely forget about Baahubali's character. And then Prabhas strides onto the screen accompanied by Keeravani's epic BM...a typical \"mass\" scene that doesn't feel typical and clich\u00e9d at all. It somehow feels awesome as you wonder\"oh dam!totally forget about this guy...jeez I wonder how this is going to play out!\"Rana does justice to his role. He is the typical \"Villain\" and although he doesn't have the complexity of the supporting cast, Rana's build and acting overrides it. Perhaps a more 3-dimensional portrayal would have been better(showing the transition from innocent brother to jealous murderer).Overall, this is one magnificent visual and emotional experience that should and will be a landmark in Indian cinema, and although like all blockbusters it has its own flaws(rushed ending...easily forgiven by the striking imagery of the final shot: A large Golden head falling down a waterfall) the complete engrossing experience is worth it all.

Movie is better in first half (before intermission) But it leaves u with a pang of death of Amrendra Bahubali, Mahendra Bahubali can be a great ruler but he is not Amrendra Bahubali. P.s. don't expect logic in war scenes. Second half should have been worked upon to make Mahendra Bahubali's character stronger.",

Coming back to the movie; Wow, how could the director deliver such a spectacle to indulge every sense of our emotions :-) Hats off. As many highlighted, the CG efforts are best in class (among Indian movies with limited infra, skills, etc). Typical mythological/epic movies miss the emotional touch. Very few movies (e.g. Gladiator) I could think of have all the flavors nicely mixed together. So it is a 10 for the directors effort. I had tears, laugh, anger, awe-inspired each and every frame of this movie. It is a must watch for movie goers of typical love subject India movies to experience a complete different world (like Pandora ;-) and drama. All Characters delivered their best and score big. Baahubali & Kattappa combo rocks the first half and set the stage for grand second half. When the expectations are so high, it is easy for creator to get trapped in some mania and loose the plot; But not Rajamoulee. He is a clever director and made sure fans leave the theater with great memories to cherish.",

            "review_title": "Truly a Game Changer for the South Indian Film Industry",
            "content": "It's hard to view Baahubali 2 beyond the scope of what the film means for the obscure film industry that produced it. As of May, 2017, Baahubali 2 is officially recognized as the highest grossing film in Indian history. This record will no-doubt be short lived. But that is exactly the point. Simply put, Baahubali 2, the sequel to the 2015 film Baahubali changed the game for Tollywood, the South Indian film industry which has long been overshadowed by Bollywood, its larger Hindi-speaking cousin. Despite the lack of global recognition, the South Indian film industry is not lacking in audience or resources. Baahubali 2 proved this by setting box office records within weeks of its release. It surpassed the previous record holders which were Hindi films that had the advantage of a much larger global audience. Before Baahubali: The Begginning was released in 2015, veteran director S.S. Rajamouli was relatively unknown beyond the local Telugu film industry based out of Hyderabad, Telangana. Prabhas and Anushka Shetty, while major stars in south India in their own right, were also relatively local. But again, the Baahubali series changed this. Fortunately, if one can manage to ignore all of the buzz surrounding the film, it is possible to appreciate the movie on its own merit. Watching the preceding film in the series, Baahubali: the Beginning isn't even necessary to understand the plot of this sequel. South Indian movies used to be notorious for the long and extravagant song and dance numbers that interrupted the film's story to add a musical layer of entertainment to the production. Fortunately, this practice is in decline. Although Baahubali 2 has some extravagant song and dance numbers. A great deal of effort was made to keep telling the story throughout the songs by depicting travel or time lapses within a song. Consequently, the songs enhanced the story instead of taking away from the dramatic effect.Baahubali's story itself isn't particularly unique. The first half of the movie is a cute love story with a health dosage of humor. The love triangle strongly resembles the iconic French play Cyrano de Bergerac, except in this case, Baahubali plays the role of Cyrano and helps a young prince of a mountain kingdom try to woo his stunning cousin played by Anushka Shetty. Just like in the play, the pretty cousin falls for the mentor instead. Unfortunately, this leads to Baahubali's eventual demise and death. The second half of the film finishes the story that was begun in the first movie and is an action-packed tale of redemption where Baahubali's son avenges his death to retake the throne of a mythical south Indian kingdom. One notable aspect of the narrative is the fact that all of the characters are flawed in humanistic ways. For instance, there is the mother who blindly loves her sons and then there is the wife who arrogantly challenges her mother in law. The character's flaws are realistic, and therefore the characters resemble actual historical figures. But in all honesty, it is pretty self- evident that historical and scientific accuracy might have been sacrificed for dramatic effect. The fighting choreography is somewhat believable with enough blood to satisfy without being too gratuitous. The bloodshed depicted in the battle scenes is almost nothing compared to what is shown regularly on television these days. Additionally, there are elements of fantasy weaved in throughout the story. While far from a high-fantasy novel inspired film like the Lord of the Rings series, there are parts that seem rather fanciful. For example, the ridiculously accurate arrows that always seemed to find their mark was a little cartoonish. Speaking of cartoonish, at one point in the film, a herd of marauding cows are used for a battle tactic . The cows themselves looked like actual cartoons. There are clearly many minor flaws that can be nitpicked. As far the CGI is concerned, there are parts that are good. But there are also noticeable parts that are bad. It's hard not to be critical of the few moments in the film where its fairly obvious that the object on- screen is an animation. This kills the tone of the movie. It might not even be excusable given Hollywood's current standard for CGI animation. Parts of Bahubali 2 felt like they might have come out of Hollywood in the early 2000s. Although these distracting moments exist throughout the film, they are few and far between. For the most part the CGI was done tastefully. The first half of the film takes place in a beautiful mountain setting supposedly in northern India. Although the CGI might be off point at times, and the story isn't particularly unique, the biggest thing that can be appreciated is the costume detail. The diverse wardrobe and costume detail truly puts Hollywood to shame. One can't help but be captivated by all of the beautiful saris, dresses, and settings and hope the South Indian film industry has much more to offer.",

You will rarely see continuous 1 ratings given by users, unless there is something amiss and I am sure something is going on here. 1 means a pathetic movie and a pathetic movie will not run full houses in theaters days after days. Anyways, Bahubali is an iconic movie, which has already changed the threads of Indian cinema-making and you should definitely watch this movie IF:#1 You are tired of watching Snyder type actions and the typical action scenes of all the super heroes Hollywood flicks. The battle scenes in this movie are creative and jaw dropping. Some of them do defy the laws of physics, but it all depends upon your expectations from the movie. The vision of the director was along the lines of a fantasy movie, larger than life, which is corroborated by a song on the ship, where you see horses in the clouds and similar...so set your expectations right. Don't expect nonsense but do expect larger than life stuff.#2 You like strong and beautifully sketched characters. In the movie they are powerful, and most have a very strong persona, especially Bahubali and Devsena (even Rajmata). It is their strong persona and the slick action scenes that make all the action scenes make-believe and you enjoy every bit of it.#3 You are thrilled by spikes of drama and emotions. Some points in the movies are super high in drama and emotions. The bow and arrow scene also seen in some posters is a beautiful synergy of love and action. As some critic had remarked, \"Love in action and Love of action\". You can watch the movie just for this scene.#4 You like poetry and art in the actions and cinematography. You cannot compare it with those of Mad Max Fury, but this movie has some pretty dramatic and beautiful ones.People have criticized Bahubali's ability to kill 100s of people alone. Which hero (let's not talk about super heroes) does not? Gladiator, Bruce Lee in all his movies, Arnold, Jason Bourne, William Wallace in Braveheart, Tarzan, Hercules, and Neo in matrix...wait...because he was \"The One\"!That's why they are heroes and not the common man. You wanna see the common man fight, go to the streets. Bahubali is not a common man for Christ's sake. He is a trained warrior king whose name itself means \"One with super strong arms\". \"Common sense-up\" people!Bads: Things I did not like about the movie were some CGIs, which were left a bit raw and were a turn off and the palm tree stunt, which could have been handled more elegantly.I was tempted to penalize 2 ratings for them, but then I thought...I am not a critic! I am a viewer and I really enjoyed this movie overall and came out feeling wowed. This is not a perfect movie, but it perfectly entertained me!So don't judge and critically evaluate it. Just go and enjoy the drama, the action and the Bahubali himself.",

            "content": "Baahubali : The Conclusion (2017): At last,the day has arrived for the conclusion of Tollywood/Indian Magnum Opus Baahubali.People have been waiting for the release of The Conclusion since 2015.Especially for the cliff hanger ending of Part 1 where the most anticipated question \"Why Kattappa Killed Baahubali?\" aroused in Indian audience minds.Any movie goer could easily predict the reason but still I didn't get why the question was so over hyped. But still I waited for this film only for witnessing Rajamouli's mark elevated emotions which are completely missing in Part 1. Did it happen then? Plot: Story begins from where \"Baahubali The Beginning\" has ended. Rajamata Sivagami (Ramya Krishna) asks Amarendra Baahubali (Prabhas) to tour entire country before swearing in as emperor.While touring, he heads to Kuntala rajyam and sees beautiful princess Deva Sena (Anushka). He introduces himself as a wanderer to her and not as soon-to-be emperor. They fall in love.Due to some incidents Sivagami makes Bhallala the emperor and Baahubali as chief of army staff. Bhallala and his father Bijjala feed wrong information to Sivagami which changes her entire soft corner on Baahubali and takes sinister routes..So Why did Sivagami change?Why Kattappa Killed Baahubali and how did Shivudu win against Bhalladeva forms rest of The Conclusion? Plus Points: 1)Pre-Interval and Interval : As the movie is progressing at dull pace in first half,Pre Interval block and Interval scenes raised the bars with extraordinary scene which definitely brings goosebumps to audience.When Prabhas and Devasena come to Sivagami, the story progresses into high emotional pitch and ends with an interval bang that would surely bring claps from the audiences.Mahishmathi background score used in that scene is the best part and definitely will be remembered as one of the best Interval blocks of Indian Cinema.Even the taking in that scene is so grand that we feel proud of it being a Telugu Cinema.2)Second half: Expectation set at Interval are met with the equally brilliant engaging second half.Second half is high on emotions and brings out the best of Rajamouli's work.There are lot of goosebumps and emotional moments in second half which is a treat for not only the fans but also for those who has no expectations.The confrontation scene between Kattapa,Sivagami and Devasena after Baahubali's death is tear-jerky moment.3)BGM: Even though songs are average,Keeravani once again gave brilliant background score. The way he elevates the proceedings with his score is impressive.4)Cinematography: Senthil's cinematography is beyond words to describe.5)Action scenes: Action scenes are on par with Hollywood standards.Especially the scene where Shivudu goes against Bhalladeva who is on his deadly chariot,the slow -motion shot at that scene is simply mind blowing.6)Rajamouli: Credit should go to Rajamouli for taking Indian films to another level with his mind blowing story telling. The way he has induced a terrific conflict between the two brothers is the major asset of the film.There is more depth in the proceedings and every character has been given complete justification.Rajamouli has stressed more on emotions which were lacking in the first part which is a good move.7)Performances: Prabhas is stunning as Amarendra Baahubali.Rana once again shined as deadly Bhallala Deva.Anushka is the show stealer of the movie with riveting performance as Devasena.Sathyaraj as Kattappa got more screen presence and more powerful in his role.Minus Points: 1)First half: First half of The Conclusion is terrible and outright silly.I still didn't get why they inserted comedy scenes involving Kattappa.The whole Kunthala kingdom episode is so clich\u00e9d and irritating.How the heck can Rajamouli think of such silly ideas while making this grand project.I sincerely hope that Rajamouli should avoid such clich\u00e9s like Songs and Comedy scenes for sake of entertainment.First half is so pathetic that I almost lost hopes on the film until the pre-interval scene.First half needs lot of trimming to make this grand conclusion more engaging.So,Baahubali: The Conclusion is an epic conclusion for India's biggest motion picture.A terrific Interval bang followed by emotional second half is the major pro of the film whereas the first half entirely disappoints with silly comedy and clich\u00e9d romance.My rating 7.5/10",

It not only answers the question \"Why Kattappa killed Baahubali?\", that has become a Meme in the last couple of years. But, it does so in such a masterful way, that you're just left in tears for something you knew was coming all along.Critics and movie goers will rave about all the Visual effects and graphics... that will stun you, no doubt. But that is not what makes this movie such a masterpiece. The storytelling, the emotional appeal of the characters, the way that each scene is constructed makes you a part of Rajamouli's world. The art direction, Vfx and camera treats you to that world to every last detail.Prabhas pulls off a marvellous job as Baahubali, a menacing warrior, loving son, caring husband who has to take several hard decisions after being handed the throne. Sathyaraj, the second most important character of the movie, takes it to another level with his brilliant performance throughout. Veterans Nasser and Ramya Krishnan dominate their screen time with magical performances while Anushka dons a fiery Queen hat perfectly. In an interesting change of things, Rana as Palvalthevan, who was introduced as a Muscular Superhuman in the first part, this time derails Baahubali as a evil genius, without flexing a muscle.The movie is quite long 2 hrs 48 mins... and it seems really long. But, it never bores you. While the war scenes are very ambitious, there are some really stupid moments. The lead characters are Super Strong people, who break the walls and floors every time they fall down and can land unscratched from 100ft drops. But the director doesn't fail to amaze you with the next scene, that you wouldn't mind some stupid stunts at all.Overall, Baahubali 2 is the Masterpiece that was promised, if not more...",

The film hit its peaks in visualizing the huge world of Maahishmati and the politics for its throne. And the answer for most asked question, Why Kattappa killed Baahubali is revealed in an unimaginable way.PLOT: The story of the film starts narration of Kattappa (Satyaraj), which paused in Part 1, where AmarendraBaahubali (Prabhas) is declared as the successor of the throne. But before his coronation to throne, ShivgamiDevi (RamyaKrishnan) orders Baahubali to tour into the kingdom to know about happiness and sorrows of the people and promises him that she finds a suitable princess for him before his return. Accompanied by Kattappa, Baahubali reaches a small kingdom, Kuntala where he see Princess Devasena and falls in love with her. Devasena fells in love with him.There starts the twist in the story, the cruel politics of Bijjaladeva (Nasser) and Bhallaladeva (Rana), the misunderstandings of Katappa and misconception of Shivgami Devi all leads to the coronation of Bhallaladeva to the throne. After some consequences, the death of Baahbali in the hands of Katappa. Finally Shivgami Devi realizes the truth and declares Mahendra Baahubali(Shiva), the new born baby, son of Devasena and Baahubali and escapes from the palace to save the baby and rest is the story which is continued in The Beginning part.Shiva returns to Mahishmati kingdom with the small army of Katappa, Avantika and the tribes to save the people from the cruelty of Bhallaladeva and his father, and to take his throne from Bhalladeva.REVIEW:PLUS POINTS: The larger than life images, great use of visual effects, the story and its twists, the rich and huge composition of every frame and the most effective use of cast and crew. All these made this movie \"a visual treat\" for audience. The man behind all these aspects, the director Rajamauli deserves the credits behind this success of the film. But film is a collective work so, before going for Rajamauli I want to make a note of these people for their contributions.ACTION CHOREOGRAPHER, Peter Hein for his ever seen stunts direction and choreography of action scenes.PRODUCTION DESIGNER, Sabu Cyril, his work can be witnessed in every frame of the film. Rajamauli just imagined the fantasy world but he discovered and shown it in every element.VISUAL EFFECTS by Makuta VFX, the visual effects which produced with great realistic extent speaks their work.EDITOR, K. Venkateshwara Rao, the effective narration of the story would be impossible without his work, the continuity of the story and the juxtaposition of the elements are good.CINEMATOGRAPHER, Sentil Kumar, he is the eye of Rajamauli, he imagined the same as Rajamauli. The rich composition and continuity of images in the film tells everything about him.STORY WRITER, Vijayendra Prasad, This is the similar story which we use to hear in our childhood days, The effectiveness of the story, the turns and twists, and the politics in the story are considerable before they augmented in to large images.MUSIC COMPOSER, M.M.Keeravani, responsible for every goose bump and emotions while we are watching the film.Finally, DIRECTOR, Rajamauli, the person behind this abstract turning into the visual treat. Rajamauli generally works with same crew and technicians who can understand every element he want to show on the large screen and he makes an effective use of them with outstanding management. Modifying the story into script and then into such visuals, everything made him one of the best directors of India.ACTORS,Prabhas, who played the dual role as the main protagonist as Baahubali done a great work by risking 5 years of his Carrier but settled deeply in the minds of audience as Baahubali, where in future may be termed as 'that Baahubali wallah hero'.Rana, the main antagonist and one of the most loved performance by audience as Bhallaladeva, with his beast appearance and the most strongest character. Though his silence speak-ed many words in some scenes of the film.Anushka, as Devasena can be said as the most dominating character in the film. Her performance in raising the issues of law in Maahishmati kingdom is the best part. With a screen presence up to large extent and the suitable personality with Baahubali, she made her mark in the film.Satya Raj, as Katappa, the most important character of the film he maintained the same charisma as expected.Ramya Krishnan, as Shivgami Devi, this is one of my most favorite character in the film and no one can replace her in this film.MINUS POINTS: First part is just an introduction to the story, the main elements and conclusion is covered in this part. Despite, there are many questions to deal, the film holds the actual story and impact is shifted to the love story, comedy scenes and songs with high visuals. All these made the second half of the film, too heavy. In the second half within a short period of time many twists and turns takes place which made uneasy to follow.Some scenes are too fictitious to accept as distinctive audience throughout India and world which may consider them as too fictitious.There is no character of played by Kiccha Sudeep in first part, his role can be used in attack of Baahubali on MaahishmatiFinally, this is my long review on the largest film of Indian cinema which proved its mettle and stamina as expensive, large and rich film. There is a lot to learn from every aspect of this film and its making, this is sure a film which shown the stamina of Indian cinema to the world. May this film may inspire many aspirant film makers to make.",

            "content": "I have not reviewed the Part-1 but will use a few references here from Part 1.The wait is over and the answer to the most awaited question as to #WKKB (Why Kattappa killed Bahubali) is definitely answered in this part but only after the interval in Bahubali2. Bahubali2 exactly opens from where Mother Queen Sivagami announces Amarendra Bahubali(Prabhas) as the future heir to the kingdom of Mahishmathi throne and Rana as the Chief Minister respectively. The film takes you through a series of scenes to convey how both the brothers Bahubali and Bhallaldeva(Rana) fall for the same princess of Kuntala, Devasena(Anushka Shetty). Bhallaladeva's raging fire of hate against Bahubali for ascending the throne which he supposedly want to ascend is given more fuel when Devasena marries Bahubali.How this sibling rivalry is handled by Bahubali Sr., Bhallaladeva and Sivagami in the flash back and how Mahendra Bahubali(Sivudu) avenges the deceit faced by his father and mother at the cunning and ruthless hands of Bhallaladeva is what the rest of the story is all about. Rajamouli's narrative is of exceptional caliber as he took utmost care when he introduced his characters in the part 1 and also made sure that those characters lived up to the audience expectations in part 2. Every character in this movie has done justice to their roles.A special mention should go to the leading men Prabhas and Rana to make themselves look bulky on screen and the fitness regime they had to maintain all through. The climax fight scene between Prabhas and Rana is extraordinary in every way. Both have put enough discipline to give them that excellent physique to flex their muscles on screen and show their might.Anushka also proved that her character Devasena does not go unnoticed as she delivered a spell bound performance especially while in confrontation scenes with Sivagami. No mention is needed for Ramyakrishna as the senior actor already showed her mettle in both part 1 and continued the same in part 2. Kattappa(Sathayraj), BijjalaDeva(Nasser), Raja Varma(Subba Raju) also got in to the skin of the characters very well.One thing which comes out in heaps and bounds and boasts off itself in the movie are the VFX and the Graphics. Undoubtedly, Rajamouli and his team have bought in the best talents in the technical department. The magnanimous sets the out of the world graphics shown in the movie will definitely take you in to a different world all together and will make you forget the world around. Right from the Flying ships, Raging bulls with fire on their horns and the flying soldiers to land on the enemies fort, everything will make you feel how creative one can get to present a story in an interesting way.Cinematography by Senthil is of top class. Music by MM.Keeravani is good especially Saho Re by Daler Mehendi, Hamsa Nava(Telugu) by Sony, Deepu and Dandaalayya(Telugu) by Kaala Bhairava are the ones which will remain in our minds for some time. Background Score raises the tempo of the movie giving you those goose bump moments. Bundled with superb production values overall a great team work by Team Bahubali.There are definitely a few short comings in the part 2 but all those can be comfortably ignored when you see this epic movie as a whole. I am sure this bigger than life experiment by Rajamouli in both the parts will be remembered for a long time and it will take a long time for any Indian movie to come even closer to this. For many Indian movie lovers both Bahubali 1 and 2 would be a great combo to add to their collection of good movies and will cherish them for a long time to come.Disclaimer - The opinions put forth here are purely personal experiences and does not endorse any commercial purpose.

Hollywood take down some notes. From the Beautiful scenes to the amazing action everything was extravagant. The Ideas used in this movie was just breathtaking. Normally songs don't win me over in movies but the songs in this movie were just beautiful and heavenly to the ears. Baahubali's theme song gives me goosebumps all the time. This movie deserves all the praise it's getting so much so that I can see this was the best movie I've\u200b seen since 2015. Baahubali: The Conclusion is undoubtedly the jewel of 2017. It will be very disappointing if this Franchise doesn't continue cause truly I would love to see more of this masterpiece. All the Actors in this movie did a amazing job you could really feel the emotion in the characters. This is must watch! Please don't miss out on this masterpiece. It's a 10/10 from me. I love this Franchise and wish to see it continue. Jai Mahishmati! Love from Portugal !.",

I Thank You Sir for having courage and determination to even think this big.. Even Spiderman, Batmen, Transformer has that Chuuran effect..If we can forgive and appreciate that, then this is far smaller error..What a weaving of Screenplay by you Sir\u0085Master Piece..If you even Watch both the parts at stretch it would just flow as Fresh Water from Himalaya..Excellent Translation of Dialogue's in Hindi Version by Manoj Muntashir..Cinematography by Senthil Kumar is at par with Hollywood\u0085Excellent Capturing of Expressions, Emotions, Unfolding of Drama, Revenge, War, etc..The hidden talent of the Series is Set Designer (Production Design) \u2013 Mr. Sabu Cyril. Friends you might not know the effect & efforts of Computer Graphics (Commonly known as VFX) looks grand and beautiful if the Basic sets are crafted beautifully\u0085So Equal appreciation is deserved by Sabu Cyril Sir..Film is Crisply Edited. And it's been efforts of the trio Venkateswara Rao, Kotagiri and Bikkina ThammirajuAnd the Richness of Music is by M.M. Keeravani and Composed by Kentaro Sato. Also good efforts by Team of Rerecording Mixers\u0085Actors Performance \u2013 1) Prabhas (Both the Roles of Baahubali) and Rana Daggubati (Bhallaladeva) Acting performance are Commendable. You can see, feel there 4 to 5 years of efforts put in for the role..Amazing dialogue delivery, handling of the persona of their characters, etc\u0085 Its Incredible. 2) Anuskha Shetty (Devasena) \u2013 I am in Love for her eyes..Have never seen any movie of her before, but I assure you she is THE Baahubali Female version in Movie\u0085Outstanding performance.. 3)Sathyaraj (Kattappa) \u2013 You just cannot hate this man..Your Love and respect for this character just increases as the Story unfolds itself\u0085This is his Acting Masterpiece.. 4) Ramya Krishnan (Sivagami) \u2013 Her Eyes speaks a lot.

But when you see part 2 you will understand why her character is there in Movie. No Director wants to show lead Hero's wife role be played by unknown artist..I hope you got your answer..I know it's too long as Review, but this Movie Franchise deserves each words of it..A big lesson to Bollywood and Other Moviewoods\u0085Its benchmark for Indian Cinema and Target for Directors\u0085Friends it's a MUST watch movie of a Decade\u0085People would still like Part 1 more than part 2 but if you see a whole Canvas together its Magnificent",

And this stand was unbelievable grossing a whimsical amount of 1000 crores and still counting which happened for the very first time in the history of Indian Cinema.The first of the movie takes it's\u200b time to setup the history, which includes the love angle between Devasena(Anushka Shetty) and Bahubali(Prabhas).There's comic relief in these portions and it's amazing how the writers have moulded Katappa's otherwise tough and dutiful character to funny antics here.But it also shows some spine chilling war sequence\u200b.Devasena's character from her younger days clearly justifies her tough status from the first part where, she stands tall against Bhallaladeva in spite of his power. Anushka Shetty as Devasena looks luminous in her princess avatar. She pulls off the action scenes equally well and has a likable chemistry with Prabhas on-screen.Sathyaraj does a great job of playing Katappa, the prime character in this film. His comic act in the first half is quite a good break from the drama otherwise.Prabhas is exceptional in this film. Thanks to his amazing screen presence, you rarely look away from him. His transformation from being an assertive leader to a love struck Baahubali, to an emotionally hurt one is simply stunning. Some scenes gave serious goosebumps, like a thunder Scene. Some war scenes were glitchy as the Vfx used there could have been more visualizing. Those sequences had really poor animation but just for some glitches, a magnum opus could not be denied. Rajamouli proved his stand that why he took so much of time to make this happen. The entry scene of Prabhas was a classic. Bahubali 2 is as big as the first one, maybe even better. A thoroughly entertaining action drama. Watch it for super amazing Prabhas and Anushka Shetty. A 8/10 for this magnum opus!P.S - it's a late review because had no time to watch due to my exams.

            "content": "People come in to watch 'Baahubali 2' for different reasons. Some have no clue what's going on, dragged in by their friends who became fans of the first blockbuster film. Others, their heads done in by swirling tertiary-level conspiracy theories about why the hero was treacherously killed in the first installment, expect no action sequences at all but rather CIA-NSA-FBI-style back-to-back scenes of intrigue, stealth and chicanery. \"Baahubali : The Beginning\", set in ancient India, told the story of a great darling of the masses whose throne, wife and life are all lost in a spiral of betrayal and whose son then rises from exile to reclaim the crowd-cheering legacy of the great 'Baahubali'. Made with Rs.180 crore and then going to gross Rs.650 crore (US$110 million), it rocked all kinds of rafters , with \"Baahubali : The Conclusion\" capitalizing on the hoopla by being sold to the market for Rs.500 crore even before release. So does it cut the royal cake satisfactorily considering the heavy expectations weighting its sword ? The good news is that it does indeed, with director and co-writer S.S Rajamouli offering something for everyone, and thus audaciously fulfilling the promise advanced in the first movie. The former film's biggest asset was the lavishly mounted , strongly executed battle sequence in the second half , the likes of which was unattempted before in Indian cinema. Bursts of boiling drama aside, Rajamouli's uses his forte in imaginatively choreographed action direction to power much of the second film. An early sequence starring a marauding elephant is mostly hot air, but the narration quickly recoups. A boar hunt is not extraordinary but Rajamouli uses a cheeky story-track of stealth and competition to keep the sequence whirring along. Then a horde of fire-horned bulls and how Baahubali deals with that rampage again makes for engaging viewing. The action peaks with a thrillingly choreographed \"three-arrow\" firing sequence where the hero launches a brave-heart counter-attack, while simultaneously firing much more potent darts into the heart of his poignantly impressed heroine whom he saves from doom. The intermission is even more special, using indirect action to drum up a mystically powerful sequence. The climactic fight loses some steam in the very last stages and the film's last scenes seem hurried in their conclusion but by then, like an inspired charioteer driving his megalithic carriage past every storm and cataclysm, Rajamouli has reached the finish line in one piece. So we have Mahendra Baahubali (Prabhas) arising from the provinces to dazzle the public and reclaim his throne in the great kingdom of Mahismati. The flashback shows us how his father, the original Baahubali (Prabhas in a double-role), a great and noble fighter relinquishes his throne and meets his downfall in a whirlpool of treachery. Junior Baahubali's mother Devasana (Anushka Shetty) spends twenty-five years enslaved in chains in the palace courtyard. Evil King Bhallaldeva (Rana Dugabatti) presides over this unholy state of the nation , a man so wicked that he uses his majestically commanding mother Sivagami (Ramya Krishnan) to achieve his ultimate goal while secretly considering her all along as just another disposable commodity. The script to its credit somehows rolls on as a juggernaut, but intricate detailing of characters is sacrificed at the altar of booming drama. Ramya Krishnan, aging but still voluptuously smoldering , is again powerful as the imposing royal mother Sivagami but the script in Part 2 makes her commit a lot of impulsive blunders. On another note, you are gravely mistaken if you expect to find subtlety in this opus. When Rajamouli jettisons the crudity of excess melodrama and elects to blend indirect gesture into his habitual power-hitting, the effect is vastly better as in the scene where the gathered soldiers and public thump the ground to show their solidarity with the second-in-command rather than the first. The cascade of its awesome consequences , both physical and symbolic, is a fantastic example of powerful frisson-generating film-making.Rajamouli knows his overall audience goes for the bigger effect and he ploughs on with giant steps crushing concerns of delicacy. In a massive court with a full audience, a man is suddenly beheaded. I thought this scene was shamelessly gratuitous rather than being plain bad, but the audience around me thought neither - with gasps of admiration and even some vocalized admirations heard all around. Heads falling off after being severed , in not just one but multiple instances, has never before been shown directly like this in blockbuster Indian cinema. I'm not praising it , nor am I damning it nor am I fence-sitting. Rather I see it as how much Rajamouli is able to make his audience go along with him for this ride. When the cinematography slows down for the shot of the ruptured carriage occupying the whole screen with the enraged Bhallaladeva poised with a spear from his besieged seat while the screen's other side shows Baahubali landing with a mighty jump crushing the heads of the harnessed bulls, one of my lady friends sitting nearby said 'That's a nice shot!'. She usually likes films like 'Dear Zindagi' , so if Rajamouli could interest her with his visual composition in the midst of hellish battle, I suspect he's got most of his market cornered. S.S Rajamouli has smartly harvested his ideas from the Indian cornucopia of magnificent mythology, and snowballed them into a grand unashamed explosion of myth and cinema hitherto unwitnessed in Indian films. With his command over large-scale technical logistics and ensuring a story that almost always hits its narrative turns strongly, Rajamouli has fully accomplished the landmark act of shaking up the scope of the Indian blockbuster - we wouldn't be one bit surprised if Aamir, Shah Rukh and Salman are now doing respective team-huddles on how to pull off a 'Khan-Bali'.

Both are not appropriate. No film is neither ten star nor a star. This means that neither one is best nor worthless. The first basis for giving a review should be the story of the film as the film is made on the first story. And second acting of character's in movie. (2)Most foreign people are talking about law a physics and logic in their review. I want to ask him that his logic in the movies of Marvel and dc goes to graze grass? I do not understand that they have such knowledge of physics, so why do they not become scientists?\n(3) Many people are telling the story of the film to be predictable. If you knew this much then one question in the first part of the film was haunting all the viewers for two whole years. Then you would become great and tell why kattappa killed Bahubali?\n(4) Many people have written the review as big as if someone is writing the story of a new film.Now I also want to say goodbye to you not to extend the review .Thank you for reading my review.@s",

Film is excellent as far as content, dialogues, music is concerned but action and VFX wise it doesn't seem to me that great which it was promised for.There were moments of people fighting with thousands and thousands of people with might and power is indigestible and on the top of it forced VFX. Not all VFX is bad, it is mind blowing in all areas except fight scene.Music is great, story and screenplay is very engaging and it will hook you till the end to learn the climax but I don't know how I will react if I have to see it again. Obviously, it is not one time watch, I can surely watch it again and again and even the first part was good.Acting was superb and the burden is completely on Prabhas who stood like rock and pulled everything beautifully.The climax finished off quickly especially after a beautiful screenplay, I wanted some drama and a fear in the eyes of Bhallaldeva. However, I appreciate SSR creativity and truly he deserve to be known as the Director of Modern Era (DOME).I happened to watch this movie one more time. The action scene in the end really sucks. May be last I watched with an awe but now it looks comical. It really doesn't exist nowhere near Dangal in fight scene. Dangal has beautifully executed action scenes that are mind blowing and here things are comical, fake and I saw all over YouTube people are laughing at its execution. Rest of the movie is still entertaining but minus action. I don't think I can ever watch this movie except if I need little fun. Sorry for the tone but despite using great VFX, Rajamouli should have invested sometime on action sequence. It is not VFX but the choice of action scene make it funny. I will be changing my rating from 8 to 6.",

            "content": "A hyped movie earn a huge amount on day 1 and continue to earn with the help of the response of the audience and Baahubali 2 proved it. People loved it but a small section of the public had an intense level of hatred, even before the release I assume, such that they wrote extremely harsh reviews. I want them to ask questions related to it. I bet they never had the expectation they reflected in their comments. What nonsense are you talking about? 3 Idiots had \"ALL IS WELL\" kicking thing but everyone loved it. Even epics like LOTR had some in-digestive stunts but I am pretty much confident that they would had loved them even though most of them defied science. This section of people genuinely need some life. While reading a few, they even compared fans being Modi Bhakts to calling the country dumb. Calling others gullible and assuming yourself as superior reflects how much you are into your egoistic world with no coming back.Moving to the movie's review, amazing story with exceptional acting especially of Devsena and Amarendra Baahubali along with Katappa, Bhalla and Shivgami. Actually, everyone acted at their very best which made this movie beautiful. VFX, for an Indian film, was perfectly suited and the screenplay was at its very best.Action scenes in the Climax went too far to be real but was eclipsed by the greatness of other scenes which stuck me till the end. Songs were to o good to be a Hindi dubbed movie. Majority of original Hindi films would've failed to deliver the soundtrack of that level. Finally moving to the ratings- Direction - 10/10 Acting - 10/10 Action - 9/10 (for the pre climax scene, just before Mahendra Baahubali enters palace) Music - 10/10 Fun - 10/10 Overall - 10/10 (without any doubt) The perfect conclusion to a mind-boggling saga.I've read some articles mentioning hatred from the elite liberal section as it is the unification of North and South along with their cultural similarities and making it a political issue. It's disappointing.Thank you!",

The movie is not just a movie but a great representation of our great culture, the power, the wealth, the art and the war. Especially the rituals, the knowledge and capability is depicted almost to reality. Nature shown in the movie is really appreciable, Bharath WAS that great with environment, the trees, plants, river and mountains (some remain now, until our culture is completely destroyed). I believe Sanskrith letters are invented to generated specific frequency for each specific letter when uttered, the Sanskrith HYMS used in movie and Sanskrith words used by any languages of movie made, makes sense and feels the intended message with the presentation. Great work has been made in film industry since the time film industry started, the very means of films is to present the story or history in a best way possible. I think film industry existence became complete, when Bharath culture was made as film and thats Baahubali. Overall it is great effort, would really appreciate the dedication and financial put in for making this movie.Wishing more success and more records brake !!! SAAHO !!!",

As telugu movies, everyone tries to be Rajni Kant with extra and super powers all the time, but really its only Rajni one can digest. Nevertheless Part-1 of the movie was excellent, with the CGI and all the affects movie was surely a treat. The story was having suspense and ending of Part 1 kept everyone guessing. Now comes the conclusion part and it was beautifully made especially till the intermission. It was full of drama and beautifully presented. The sets, the affects, the plot everything is going pretty well till the intermission. Yes the affects in the end part and the final fight were a bit weak. Even the director pushed the war fantasy beyond mental perception. As a final verdict its a must see movie and as an advance do watch part one before this one, other wise you wont be able to understand the movie. Prabhas, Rana Daggubati, Anushka Shetty were all fabulous. But on a personal level loved the acting of Ramya Krishnan, she was simply outstanding.",

You will feel that you are part of the Mahishmathi kingdom. conflict between characters is portrayed very well. Execution is flawless, graphics/vfx simply superb and they blend with the story and support the superior characters that the director envisioned whether it is giant halls or elephants or armory. Background score and music makes movie much more appealing and engrossing. there is no doubt that this movie is milestone in Indian film history. I would put this in the category of avatar. This film is really pride of Indian cinema. I would very very strongly recommend you to watch this movie.side note for those who are criticizing based on the logic. one guy questions how a simple human carry huge weighing tons. i don't understand where has the criticism gone when there exits super humans like spider man, hulk or the entire avenger series of characters. After all this is a fictional movie not a documentary. There is something called cinematic liberty where the characters are elevated to the level that evokes your emotion. what about avatar? the characters are fictional. The planet with species that are far superior than humans which is a work of fiction. For the god sake the kings in this movie are still human but are very skill full. I don't understand where the logic is missing in this movie. Hindu mythology has so many strong characters that will put all the western super heroes into dust.",

This plot wouldn't have been possible without a great piece of direction from Rajamouli sir.Lead actor Prabhas(Bahubali) make sure he delivers the kingly and powerful appearance and great piece of acting. And it's rarely seen in Indian movies were two female actress are playing important part in the plot and kudos to Anushka(Devesena) and Ramyakrishnan(Sivagami) for delivering it with power packed performance. Supporting actors Subbaraju(Kumara Verma) and Sathyaraj(Katappa) bring the unexpected humor to the film adding a big plus to the movie,well Satyaraj was just awesome in every aspect. Villains Rana(Bhallal Deva) and Nasser(Ballal's Dad) bring out the bad vibes from the audience as they are plotting their deadly schemes.It's far less we get to see Indian movies that are war based with good action sequence and so well executed well personally I liked the first war scene then the concluding one of this part and not to mention this story takes place in fantasy of Mahishmati kingdom as some critics again confuse it with the real world and are pointing fingers of breaking newton's law.

The curiosity of 'Why did Katappa kill Baahubali' may have been a reason for several people to have gone to see the sequel but for me I was there to witness how director S. S. Rajamouli progresses the saga with the alleged buzz. To my surprise he's successful at making an equally powerful sequel. Baahubali 2 does have its loopholes but at the end it'll leave you satisfied. The movie starts to narrate the story right from where Katappa left it in part 1 however he adds more incidents that form the basic plot for the sequel. The story talks about the love story of Amanendra Baahubali and the brave princess Devasena and the gruesome battle between her and Rajamata Shivamgami Devi. I must say Prabhas nails the role he plays. Anushka Shetty who plays Devasena is charming, bold and applaudable at many places. One thing that Rajamouli is able to do in this sequel is that he's very well toyed with all the emotions. Throughout the movie you'll come across many scenes where you get goosebumps, at places you will happy (coz Prabhas' nd Anushka's chemistry will surely get you), you'll laugh and at the mid of second half you'll cry. Katappa is even more powerfully played this time. However this time you don't get to see Tamannah but still she is enough. However the stunts in this part are really laughable. But still this movie is going to give you what you would have wanted.",

Hollywood's 300,Hercules,Benher,Exodus gods and kings are nothing compared to baahubali 2. The words of baahubali while dying somehow stole my tears! the tears from my eyes weren't stopping at all. I couldn't control my tears.. It felt like a real story to me and its all due to Rajamouli and team. the ideas which he put in this film are so unique(RAJAMOULI) and no one can ever find it in any Hollywood movies... The background music is an other best thing which made baahubali to look so damn!! in my opinion this movie should get the Oscar. THIS IS A LEGENDARY FILM NEVER GONNA FORGET THIS MOVIE!

The overall plot is a flashback and the reason why Kattappa killed Bahubali as advertised to increase hype for the sequel was kind of weak. Anyway there was more depth to the characters this time. The motives for the villain seemed better this time than 'I'm a villain because I'm a villain'. It showed that people are not perfect and that humanizes them. Every character had egos, though annoying is realistic. The consequences of having an ego is realistically depicted here. I actually wanted to like the first one but could not. This one on the other hand was just above average. The destruction of the statue in the end to creatively show us a bygone era forgotten by time was really an amazing conclusion.",

However, SS Rajamouli's epic gets loose on plot and screenplay. It's not even half as fun as the original one.. it suffers from unnecessary lengthy sequences.. boring romantic scenes and a LOT of drama. The dialogues are not up to the mark and so as the background score + music's compare to BAAHUBALI 1.One biggest disadvantage of this film is the length of the film which is about 3hrs 17mins LONG... which makes it unbearable to watch.

            "content": "If films are to be believed ...then there is a very famous line in the movie-'The Dirty Picture'films work because of 3 things... ENTERTAINMENT...ENTERTAINMENT...ENTERTAINMENT... & Guess what 'Bahubali-The Conclusion' is the most entertaining film of recent time... I find 'Bahubali-The Beginning' a good (just good) film... like 3/5 but i find the 2nd part more refreshing,more bigger,more gripping & more solid . Now let us take a look at various perspective- Star Performance-PRABHAS is the LIFE of film.U cannot describe his hard work &dedication in 1000 words.(as that man gave his 5 yrs for both films).Rana Daggubati is brilliant but gets less scope as he has less screen timing.Anushka Shetty is perfect as devsena.I don't think any actress in India could've pulled it off with such brilliance.Tammanah has a 2 min role which will go unnoticed.If there is any actor which will steal the limelight here is SATHYARAJ as our favourite KATTAPA.He is FANTASTIC.Ramya Krishnan as SIVAGAMI is equally good.Nassar & Subbaraju are first rate. Direction-The best thing about Bahubali(both parts) is the vision and direction of SS Rajamouli.He is undoubtedly one of the finest director we have.After leaving the theatre i was feeling so proud because of him,he made me realize what we indians are capable of. His vision of creating the MAHESHMATI KINGDOM is so pure that u find yourself relating to every character of story.He showed how With a limited budget one can create such wonder.Every Indian must feel proud...bcoz if we have SAJID & FARAH KHAN then we also have SS Rajamouli who is a master storyteller. 'BAHUBALI THE CONCLUSION' is his best work till date. Cinematography & VFX-Both are 10 times better than 1st part. As the budget of the sequel was more,VFX is quiet IMPROVED. Honourable Mention for the PRODUCTION DESIGN by Sabu Cyril. I am not saying that this movie is perfect...It has its problems like a scene involving wolves..that could've been technically better...or Bhallaldeva could've more screen time.. But it is supremely entertaining as it offers class in the name of entertainment.(Note-If u don't like Bahubali-The Conclusion, then plzz watch HIMMATWALA,HUMSHAKALS,TEES MAAR KHAN,SHAANDAAR.U will definitely like these epics ).",

            "content": "The frenzy and thirst for more that the first part started and caused in 2015 had to be quenched by content that has more power, more action, and more grandeur. This epic romantic drama, which is South Indian director S S Rajamouli's eleventh feature film, has the combined effect of all these factors, but is unsurprisingly let down by lack of logic.Resuming exactly where the first part ends, the story follows king- slave Kattappa's (Sathya Raj) narration of the past events that occurred in the Mahishmati kingdom and how they directly led to its degeneration under the rule of the foxy and narcissistic Bhallaladeva (Rana Daggubati). Shiva (Prabhas), upon realizing his lineage, has to save the kingdom now and settle some scores...Predictability is all over the place as you follow the flashback story involving Bahubali (Prabhas), who uses a method previously sampled by the protagonist in the 2005 Tamil film \"Ghajini\", to woo Devasena (Anushka Shetty), the fiery queen of a nearby smaller kingdom. Bahubali, with ample help from Kattappa, fool around with Devasena, as humor and borderline slapstick enter the concoction (but do not stay for long), which soon shifts to high drama as the lover boy's brother, Bhallaladeva, now has his eyes on Devasena. It's a ploy actually, which he masterminds with help from his crippled father, Bijjaladeva (Nassar). What ensues is a game of shifting, smarmy egos and value of integrity between Bahubali and his aunt, Sivagami (Ramya Krishnan), whom he regards as his mother. How things take a swift turn to what led to the events in the first part is what essentially the first two hours of this film is. It is up to Shiva to bring back the kingdom's glory by doing what is right: unshackle Devasena, his mother, and take back what is lawfully his.There is enough substance for an average film-goer to look at and appreciate here. Starting from the opening credits, which poses as a prologue and a visual narration of the first part so that you can brush up, to the high-octane stunts that defy logic and science to derive magic, the good old melodrama, and an obvious yet satisfying answer to the eternal question derived from part one's climax. While Bahubali 1 banked on structural storytelling and a pretentious climax to hook its viewers, Bahubali 2 uses more firepower and style. On that front, it is imperative that we give the makers full marks for efforts and storytelling. Romance between Bahubali and Devasena is strictly martial, but is still palpable to our hungry senses. As is evident from the loads of social media mentions lauding both of these characters' authenticity and idealism, if there is one thing that you will take away from the Bahubali films, it is the virtues that these characters adopt and explicitly endorse. Also, there is this faint sampling of didacticism swaying around in the plot - whether it is trying to erect a feminist character like Devasena or showcasing the brutal kingdom affairs of the bygone era or the sexist nature of things - the pedagogical element is present, making the film overwhelming to some.Having said that, there cannot be any excuse to the substandard CGI that is at show here. The degree of implausibility blows through the roof, yet it's the heroism that comes to the rescue in every single frame. Why the characters do not succumb to their injuries may be retorted by mythological and religious references, but for a learned viewer, there are going to be issues with the film. Weighing these issues with the grandeur and volumes of melodrama makes us reach to a conclusion which is slightly positive, only if you consider the entertainment value.Director Rajamouli's storytelling should be lauded, and film students may want to take notes. He directs his cast well, and in order to describe them, we must first appreciate the casting. I cannot imagine anyone else playing these characters with such finesse and fidelity. Prabhas is magnificent in his portrayal as the hero of the people, and puts up a tireless show in both the films. His nuanced performances as Shiva and Bahubali - two characters with little difference - can be counted as one of the biggest defining factors of the franchise's success. Same goes for Daggubati as the classic villain. However, if I had to choose one star who shines like the greatest of all, it is Shetty, with her electric performance as Devasena. Sure, Bahubali supports her as the independent woman that she is, but her idiosyncratic stances on causes that matter to her, and her dialogues are all so defining (and relatable to the recent feminist uprising), it will be harder to not understand why she is the cinema character of the year. Nasser and Krishnan are equally good, but Sathyaraj is the man who will be remembered for his role and portrayal ten years for now, after Prabhas.Overall, there is enough for viewers to both love and hate here. Which side you delve into more depends on how you perceive the sequences that make up the film. If you are someone who judges a film's watchability on the basis of its score, screenplay, and cast performance - then this is going to be a fun affair. If you aim for the plot holes or the poor CGI, then disappointment is going to be your friend.BOTTOM LINE: S S Rajamouli's \"Bahubali - The Conclusion\" is a tightly-packed doll of goodies about kings, queens, love, and deceit that will entertain you most of the time. Arguably, one of the most entertaining films of 2017, if you choose to watch it, do it on the big screen. Go for a weekday show!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES",

            "review_title": "\"Bahubali 2 \u2013 The Conclusion\" : This millennium's \"Sholay\"",
            "content": "Apparently one of the last reviews (if not 'the' very last) on \"the highest grossing Indian film ever\", also dubbed as \"a legend on celluloid\" \u2013 \"Bahubali 2 \u2013 The Conclusion\". A film that everyone would have already watched by now (if not 'about to'/'willing to soon'). Despite this review's redundancy, the film is indeed all that's been said about, and then some more.Long ago, when B.R. Chopra's \"Mahabharat\" was in pre-production, its casting director Gufi Paintal (a.k.a. \"Shakuni\") was given a guideline \u2013 'not to cast humans, but the ones with exceptionally herculean personalities'; which held true for this Telegu cinema's first 4K High Definition flick. The film opened with the 'porcelain-stroked' animated stills from \"Bahubali - The Beginning\" amidst the thumping song \"Shivam\", and immediately we knew that the makers meant business. The 'mythological reality' of Mahishwati calling back to the bloodshed and sacrifices which paved the throne of evil. Though, such antics have merely begun. The film mainly focused on the glories of an epic compassionate warrior rightfully worthy of being the king, Amarendra Bahubali \u2013 the father of Mahendra/Shivdu (both played by Prabhas). When leading a charge in a power-packed ambush, Bahubali and his lady Devasena (Anushka Shetty) come closer and subsequently marry. Meanwhile Bahubali's envious vile elder brother Bhallaldeva (Rana Daggubati) schemed to dethrone him with his undiplomatic father Bijjaldeva (Nassar). They dupe Queenmother Sivagami (Ramya Krishnan) and banish Bahubali, get him murdered through the loyal Katappa (Sathyaraj), the newborn son had to grow up in exile unbeknownst of his history and fate. Thus, the good empire fell; only now a spectacular war would be to avenge. S.S. Rajamouli's writing-direction is 'incredible' in painting a fictional-mythology with real flesh and bone. The gauntlet of creating a more enigmatic film than its previous part had been picked and delivered with aplomb. The mastery came in sync with the monumental sets, the state of the art VFX and sound design along with signature South cinema emotions. Despite popular Western comparisons \u2013 with \"Avatar\" and even \"The Lion King\" his embellished work is inherently and marvelously Indian. Prabhas is phenomenal and so is Anushka, who play their characters better than others. Daggubati felt rightfully antagonizing and Subbaraju added to plot- twists and turns; although, Tammanah is blink and miss in this one. Another massive plus - M.M. Keeravani's music, the film's pulsating soul. From \"Jiyo Re\" for the mighty Bahubali to his fantastical- romance with Devasena's \"Veero Ke Veer\". Even more majestic is his adept orchestral background- scoring, without which the the film wouldn't have been the same.The much talked action-choreography's aura came as an industrial stunner, packed with the adrenaline of a stadium. None could expect adapting the panache of combat-nuances of a Japanese-manga action presented in thrilling beauty. Those \"speed ramping\" shots \u2013 alternating between deliberately slowing down and exaggeratingly speeding up action movements \u2013 are inspiring. The symbolism of love, respect and hate through 'blood' is perhaps used one of the most impressive ways imaginable and despite graphic violence there is a lack of cringe worthy gore.Even with such brilliance, \"Bahubali 2\" went slightly off course with legit character-development and storyline. The Screen writing incorporated pretty complex aspects however, in the process lost some sheen. Adding up, the climax doesn't excite any further due to the fact that the excitement never fell once through the three acts \u2013 which seemed pretty good, but definitively exhausting. Post- climax, the end speeds up to completion. Only real disappointment is the answer to the \"cliffhanger of the year\" \u2013 \"Katappa ne Bahubali ko kyun maara?\" Adequate, but undercooked and amidst the hype doesn't impress one bit where one could take Katappa as a 'dimwit'. Even with the unevenness none shall not be bored.An applaudable \"8.25/10\" for its milestone cinematic, technical and popular feat; the \"Sholay\" of this millennium!",

            "content": "YES, finally we get to know why kattappa killed bahubali. but was it satisfying? yes to an extent. If people clamouring in theatre over all heroic scenes are your kind of entertainment then bahubali could blow your mind because Rajamouli , this time, has made the hero look more heroic and included scenes which can grab all the audience claps. I would like to discuss some of the positives and negatives about this film.Positives:1. A better and engaging story line than the first part2.The title sequence was actually great 3.Performances of all actors were good especially the main lead prabhas4. The hunting scene at beginning was amazingly done 5. Fight sequences were amazingly doneNegatives:1.The graphics at some point looked good and at other points it was actually bad2. The fight scenes had no logic at all. Some times we think of ourselves \" Yaah this is a typical telugu movie\" So in short Bahubali is surely a masterpiece from Indian cinema but cant compare with Hollywood epics due to comparatively lack of story line and some bad graphics and last but not the least 'LOGIC'.",

            "content": "Walking out of the theater after watching the movie, I didn't feel necessarily \"concluded\". It was more along the lines of \"It ended?\" Don't get me wrong, the film had its moments, but there wasn't any scene I would gasp at, let alone think back to the first movie for a plot point I may have missed. Let me back up. This time around, it is Bahubali Sr. (Prabhas) who takes center stage for the better part of the movie, but his character is fickle, more like clay, molding according to the situation, i.e., being heroic. This can be brushed off, but sticks out like a sore thumb that the film is still shackled by old school Indian Masala cinema. Devasena (Anushka Shetty), with the initial reveal, raised my expectations of the heroine being more than a pastime, but in the end, turned out to be more of what we have become used to in Indian Cinema. There is little to no chemistry of the leading pair as they barely have any scenes together except for a well choreographed archery sequence. The first half is your regular hero and heroine love story with little formulaic comedy here and there. But is well placed. Moving onto the second half, things begin to rush on from one scene to another and me, as the audience, was left looking at people sitting by the side, with puzzled expressions. Other than the obvious big reveal, there isn't really anything big going for the story.What steals the show is the visuals. And this was what I had least expectations on, going in. The visuals are on point from start to finish, and I can say, pretty confidently, at Hollywood levels. Almost all of the scenes are CGI, and it doesn't show. The background score by SS Rajamouli's long time collaborator gels with the plot, and is pleasing. The art for the various song visuals, is breathtaking too. The actors dole out their best on screen performances but nothing outstanding.In conclusion (lol) , though it has no story wise surprises, (rather there are several points in the movie which make little to no sense) the film is a showcase of how far Indian Cinema has come, even though it is subdued because of the same, but nevertheless a treat for the eyes!",

No doubt, climax would disappoint you and it won't be like you expected it to be. That's because initially they didn't started from his son and rather went straight to the story telling that keeps you bit disconnected from his son revenge and you will cheer less for him as much as you will for his father throughout the movie. There are some tricks in the fights which are new and takes you by surprise. A great round of applause for Rajamouli Saab for such a wonderful movie.",

But am in love with the movie, they way it has been depicted and taken. I can see days and nights of multiple thoughts behind each scene. Excellent work. Once in a lifetime achievement for Rajamouli garu. I wish him all the best to deliver good movies (than the usual make hero happy, producer happy and run movie as any other business.

            "content": "Talk of the town is \"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion\". After a long wait of 2 years for the desperately needed answer of question \"Why Katappa killed Baahubali?\", so eventually movie was released on 28th April 2017. A day in history of Indian Cinema where every Indian will be proud to say that, yes this is our film. The biggest challenge for the director was to make audience relieved, thrilled and mesmerized by the final part. And if a person has a vision for something then he/she will go to any limits to fulfill that vision, which indeed is clearly seen in the film.The concluding part moves forward where the first part ended. I am not going tell you the story because many reviewers, VJ blogs already reviewed the movie. On the first day itself there was enough hype regarding the movie and yes it is still maintained. Usually sequels succeed better than first part, but here it is reverse. In this film you could feel and see emotions, love, rage, jealousy, humor, politics, intelligence and many more other things.All the characters, Baahubali, Bhallaladeva, Sivagami, Devasana, Katappa, Bijjaladeva, Avanthika and others were portrayed superbly on the screen. Hero of the film is S S Rajamouli who made us believe in cinema once again. Amarendra Baahubali was best than Shivadu aka Mahendra Baahubali (I MAY BE WRONG). Why I said so, you will find out in movie. Thanks to the makers for giving us new face of negative role in form of Bhallaladeva, as expected the fight scenes between core characters are impressive and wish to be seen again and again. Strong lady characters Sivagami & Devasana are at par highest level of acting where they embraces some classic performances. Katappa, what could I say about this guy. He was awesome in giving justice to the character, because of which movie doesn't fail anywhere. Bijjaladeva is like other version of Shakuni (Mahabharat) and well performed on his scale. A minor role to Avanthika, but OK.Action sequences, CGI, visual effects are at the level of any Hollywood film, not fully matched but yes. Hero's vision is clearly on the screen, how he thinks, how actions sequences must be and how the climax should be. Songs of Hindi version are OK but BGM was great specially in climax scenes. Introductory scenes of Baahu in initial minutes, introductory scenes of Baahu at kingdom of Kunthala, unexpected battle sequences from strange communities, chemistry between Baahu & Devasena\u0085. Just watch it guys, goosebumps is definitely guaranteed.Cinematography, VFX, Screenplay-Direction (Hero) are at another level. Art of storytelling by S S Rajamouli is fantastic, he knows how to keep audience engaged. Film is released in four languages, its already breaking some domestic and international records. Definitely this is the best from Indian Cinema to the world. Official run-time is 2hrs 50mins and you won't know when climax came. Kindly stop piracy and encourage the cast and crew for making this film magnificent.Its not any festival, its not any Khan's film, its BAAHUBALI.Bold. Heartfelt. Masterpiece. Incredible. Thrilling.Rating: 4/5",

            "content": "I was fascinated by the rave reviews for the two Baahubali movies so I decided to give them both a try. (Any movie scoring 8 or above on IMDb has a solid chance of being a winner.)What I have learned is that IMDb scoring is subject to the social media phenomenon of being skewed by an ardent fan base. In the case of Baahubali, the movie has been a huge hit in an isolated market, continental India. A billion Indians can't be wrong, but they sure can skew an IMDb rating when they vote as a bloc.While Baahubali is astounding audiences in its native homeland (there are some great articles about the movie's importance to the industry and to the North and South regions of the country), American audiences with their highly sophisticated expectations will most likely agree with me that the overall result is an immature, incredibly predictable, poorly executed, soap opera that does not merit its hype or its two-part 5 and half hour running time.MY OBSERVATIONS: Baahubali's story is intriguing as it presents to us a legendary super hero who appears to come from a rich and ancient history/lore. The source material is every bit as promising as heroes from Western culture (Samson, Superman, Hercules, etc.). However, the execution of the story turns great drama (love, family, betrayal, support from the gods, fall from grace) into a soap opera complete with cheesy reaction shots accompanied by shock music more appropriate for 1970s TV sitcoms with their spit takes and laugh tracks.The highly applauded visual effects are mediocre by American standards. Other reviewers have detailed these issues adequately so I will only add my support to their criticisms.The acting is hit or miss. Some scenes come across powerfully (love scenes, for example) while others (like those in the royal court) remind us of American TV sitcoms from the 1970s.BOTTOM LINE: If you are calibrated to fine cinema, are looking for a good epic, and are considering Baahubali, then do some research and enter into the viewing prepared to walk away. I, for one, wish I could get my 5 and half hours back.",

Or do you remember how Maximus unleashed his heroics in Ridley Scott's Gladiator? If you do, then just with Indian ethos of religion and emotions coupled with the well known storyline, Bahubali 2 has nothing new to offer as far as the plot is concerned. The movie is a prequel to the earlier one and it deals mostly with Mahendra Bahubali's father Amarendra, who was destined to be the emperor. Shivagami (Ramya Krishnan), the reigning queen of Mahishmati, feels that Bahubali (Prabhas) whom she raised as her own child is fit to become the ruler of the Kingdom. This causes anguish to her own son Bhalla Deva (Rana Daggubati) who conspires with his father to become the King and guile Shivagami to banish Bahubali and his wife from the royal premises. Even in exile, Bahubali selflessly continues to serve the commoners and his ever increasing fame causes discomfort to Bhalla. In a filthy conspiracy plot, he and his father entangles Shivagami and tricks her to issue a death order for Bahubali. The act was carried out at the queen's orders by the unwilling and faithful Katappa (Sathyaraj) thus answering the question which has been bothering us for quite a long time. What ensues is a pretty linear tale as to how the conspiracy gets exposed and Amarendra's son Mahendra Bahubali (also Prabhas) gets his revenge from the wicked Bhalla Deva. The plot also deals with Amarendra's love story with Devasena (Anushka Shetty) and the movie ends with scores of action sequences which could have been cut 15 minutes short. But who remembers Ben Hur or The Ten Commandments for its plot? Who thinks of Jurassic Park merely as a story? Bahubali 2 is a visual extravaganza and one must give due credit to S.S.Rajamouli and team for such an ambitious venture. If Bahubali 1 had soared high, this one had taken the ride higher. What James Cameron said about \"Integration of science with motion pictures\" \u2013 Bahubali 2 is India's notch in that sphere. It's the very best of CGI and VFX keeping in mind an emotional content in an Aesop based folklore style. So forget details or the finer nuances, relish the treat for the eyes.",

S. Rajamouli (Director-Off screen Bhahubali): No doubt, Rajamouli had given us world-class visualizations and screenplay. He narrated each and every character as a weapon. We should say hats off to his commitment and passion towards the Cinema. M M Keeravani (Music Mantrikudu-MM): Behind every movement to be successful there will be a tune on background score. MM has done his marvelous job and background score.Prabhas (On screen Bhahubali): He has delivered the fantastic performance with his attitude and personality, the way he had connected to the story and all is wordless. We should also appreciate him towards his commitment of Cinema for about five years for this project.Satyaraj (Kattappa): He has done his job fantastically and moreover one of the key people in this movie after Bhahubali character (Prabhas).Ramyakrishna (Shivagami): Perfect \"Rajamatha\". She has shown excellent action towards her character and in fact added more value to the movie. Rana ( Bhallala Deva): Another name of \"Villainism.\" He made himself towards more cruelty with his fantastic performance.Cinematography (K. K. Senthil Kumar): He had made this part to such a top level regarding extraordinary visualizations treat with his two eyes.VFX: Visualization is one of the assets to this movie and had created the best benchmark for Tollywood and Kollywood cinema industry.No doubt, there will be a page for Bhahubali in an Indian film history along with characters called as Bhahubali, Bhallala dheva, Shivagami, Kattappa, Devasena, and Avanthika forever.The bottom line of the movie: The film is all about perfect visualizations and emotions together with fantastic presentation.",

Final verdict : GO FOR IT,IT WONT DISAPPOINT YOU.",

Since there are more than 300 viewer reviews here, so I'm not going to review the movie again.I'll take the opportunity to congratulate Mr. Rajamouli for taking the Indian movie industry to the next level. Baahubali, Balladeva, Katappa, Shivgami, Devasena - you've brought the best in everyone. I'm not from south India and I don't understand the languages too. But still I'm waiting for its Telugu version. I'm a bigger fan of south Indian movies (I particularly watch Telugu movies with subtitles). And you've proved it again why my choice is not wrong. Creations like Vikramaduru, Eega, Magadheera are my favorites. Those who understand your vision, will never stop praising you.I believe we are lacking visionaries in our film industry. You sir, Mr. Shankar and Mr. Sanjay Leela Bhansali only are capable of creating such epics in my opinion. It seems like the word 'impossible' doesn't find a place in your dictionary. I thought Magadheera was something that defines a standard, but with Baahubali you've set the standards so high that Indian film industry has got a new identity worldwide. We are fortunate to witness your creations.The reviewers who gave 1 or 2 stars for this movie out of 10, are simply lying. By no means this movie deserves 1-2. Lastly, applause for the whole team. I am eagerly waiting for the next venture.",

Be it the heroic fights or the lavish war scenes, Rajamouli showcases some never before scenes in Indian film history.

Second half went off on a serious note and again Prabhas presence in the movie was excellent.. Ramya Krishnan was fully utilized in her role by greater extent..

That one particular shot, Sivagami showing the Son of Baahubali to people. Absolute goose-bump moment. Of-course it did remind me the shot from LionKing.Apart from the character Baahubali, I very much liked the other key people moving the story in #Baahubali2. Sivagami, Kattapa, Pallal Deva, Devasena and Pijjala Deva. Story and screenplay nicely plotted by these characters nicely. Especially liked the roles of Sivagami and Devasena, they are the shining stars for their strong characterisation.Plot of having a misconception leads to major events in movie, reminding me some previous movies with similar plot element. Yes, the reason for why Kattapa killed Baahubali also was so predictable.On the whole part 2, did good justification for first part. But I still feel the running time of first half is longer and after the flashback, plot is rushing towards the finish...!!By this time, most of the people would have watched this in theatre and it is very much needed for encouraging such grand movies from directors like #Rajamouli...!

From the beginning of this movie, it was really good sign to watch and I think Rajamouli will not disappointed in first 75% of the movie. You can watch romance, action, thrilling and much more twist. I really enjoy that part. The part became worst When Kattappa back from memorizing and Mahendra Baahubali starts to take revenge against Bhallaladeva. I think this part filming was 2 years ago. Because you will find a huge disappointed VFX and screenplay problem here. I was just disappointed to watch those scenes with silly, video game type of VFX! It just ruined my expectation and the story line can be more strong or can be some most twee at the end. But Rajamouli disappointed me. Yeah, it's an entertaining movie. I agreed.

Movie teaches lots of got good things as well. Whatever or whoever tries to do bad things, good things only will win or remain at the end. Bahubali entry, making shivagami complete the task, similarly doing the same for deevsena for 25 years sacrifice, walking in pal val deevan statue head, is like killing his karvam, annavam, etc. Fighting, teaching how to send 3 arrows at single shot and also romance at the same instance, what a classic. Slow motion capture during fight sequences with blood shed's, maybe I have seen in troy, 300, etc. but it feels great to see in Indian language. The strategy used during the war sequences are great, little bit reminded prince of Persia game. Yet it has some similarities but it's not a copycat, the movie reached that standard with the emotion's and our Indian culture. Ship flying in air suddenly, what a thinking. Even the small small things like stone moving while people encouraging Bahubali while taking oath. Using tree to enter into the kingdom, breaking the gate and landing, saving kingdom using fire in bulls horn and opening the dam to complete the fight, wow what a thinking, simply mind blowing.

            "content": "I'm reviewing the Telugu version of this movie, being the original version. I've watched the Hindi version too, so will also mention the overall quality of the dubbing.I'm primarily a Hollywood movie viewer, as many of the viewers of reviews here on IMDb would be. But this movie is in a class of it's own!First of all, I was shocked to see hundreds of negative reviews of this movie! These people seem to have a hatred for Indian movies, and don't even stop to judge fairly. These are the same people who'll upvote and go ga-ga over 300, Lord of the rings, and similar movies, but can't seem to find anything positive to talk about this movie, which is extremely mature in it's story-telling. The harsh injustice portrayed in this movie reminds me of Game of Thrones, but even better, as it delivers many messages in the midst of all this.The crispness and richness of this movie leaves me shaken! Finally, an Indian movie which involves you in it's story, making you laugh, tugs your emotional heartstrings, and leaves you walking taller by the end of the movie....well... at least till you come back home! :)The sheer masculinity of this movie seems almost too much to absorb, but you fall into it's sway, and root for the larger-than-life characters in it. Be it Sivagami Devi, or Amarendra Bahubali, the dashingly handsome and villainous Bhallala Deva, the loyal-to-death Kattappa, and last but not the least, the exquisite Devasena!, each of these characters is impressive and rich in depth!The songs too are superb, with the lyrics adding to the story-line. Never do you feel that a song is suddenly thrust upon you, and you sway to the beauty of the song in which Devasena worships Krishna. Many of the songs are having incredible instrumental tracks, and the masculinity oozes through in many songs such as Sahore Bahubali, Oka Praanam.The sheer beauty of O O Re Raja and the picturisation of the swan boat is Magical! Very imaginative sequence.There are some cringe-worthy moments, esp. in the last part of the movie, where you watch not only Bahubali defy gravity, but also common soldiers! I felt that they could have been a bit more mature in this part, and shown Bahubali build alliances like a real king would, instead of raw, full on physics defying stunts. Though this jarred a bit, I swallowed it and went on.I've watched this two times (first alone in Telugu, then again in Hindi with my wife) till now, and normally my wife isn't a person to swallow things without questioning them. She has an inborn talent of poking holes in most movies, but I found that even she was involved in this movie, and the few heavily emotional moments in the movie had her in tears literally. The director certainly knows how to squeeze out every last drop of emotion in some of the scenes! To the point that my normally critic wife forgot her critical thinking and concentrated on the story being told!Oh, and the Hindi dubbing was really good too! It didn't have those oh-so-irritating usual Hindi voice artists of old, and there were only a few instances where the lip sync wasn't up to the mark. Even the way the lyrics of the songs have been translated clearly shows that the multi-lingual aspect of this movie was taken into consideration from the start.People having a problem with physics-defying stunts fail to remember that there are similar stunts in so many Hollywood movies, I can't even count how many!Overall, an AWESOME movie, and I haven't even talked about the mind- blowing graphics yet!Yes, they're truly impressive, but I felt that the real value of the graphics is that they let you concentrate on the story, and make the entire story believable, engrossing. I've seen some flashy movies where the intention seems to be to impress with graphics, and there's little or no oomph to the story. With Bahubali, this is not the case. The graphics make the story richer, and the movie might not be as impressive as it is with them... Yet, I feel that the overall value to this movie is it's amazing story line, where Truth is made to grovel, suffer, but finally claw it's way up and win!An EPIC MOVIE!",

There is a lot of ambition and effort put into this movie and it all pays of (6 years is a lot of dedication for 1 movie). Both Bahubali movies attempt and achieve something that Bollywood has not yet achieved. Its the passion for a project, belief and trust they put into this.Regarding the movie, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie (especially the first 2/3's of the movie. The suspense wasn't good enough as I was able to figure out why Katappa kills Bahubali (a question everyone asked after watching Bahubali: The Beginning). However, the buildup to that or the execution of that one scene was a work of a master- film- making. I was in love with the first 2/3rd of the movie. Yes there are scenes that are way over the top, especially the battle scenes and I forgive the movie for that. It's no mystery that the movie will be going to go over the top when the first movie already has those elements. I went to find the conclusion to the Bahubali story and I found it, I went to have a great time and hell yeah I had a great time with this movie.P.S. I hope there is a remastered version of this movie in the future.",

So much for logic in Indian Movies I can all ready see next set of youtube comedy videos coming from that scene.

I watched the dubbed Hindi version, and that might have killed some of the dialogues in the original Telugu script, although that doesn't take any bit of magnificence away from the movie. CGI effect was mind blowing and so was the action sequence. The laws of physics being put upside down, aside, the movie also depicted the golden era prevalent in the Pre-Medieval era. If Bahubali I was the 1st small step towards greatness for Indian cinema, Bahubali II would be the giant leap. How many sequels have been better than the original movie? Bahubali II has not just been better, but remarkably better than Bahubali I, which in itself was better than most of the Indian movies. That in itself is a feat. Set the bar quite high and then cross it beyond miles in the sequel. Bahubali II is the perfect movie for anyone to experience the ancient great of 'Indianness'. The intro of female lead with sword in hands wearing traditional 'Indian' clothes symbolizing the female power 'Shakti' is mind blowing.All along there are at least 14 moments which give the spectators goosebumps of epic proportions and might even make 1 weep in joy and awe.The only thing BAD about Bahubali II is that there won't be a Bahubali III, well that and some of the songs, which did not contribute to the grandeur of the movie .Hopefully the Director of the movie would be encouraged to make more movies from the Pre-Medieval era especially about the Gupta rules, Vijaynagar kingdom and the Cholas.",

Rajamouli is at his very best in crafting and catapulting this movie to the top of the blockbuster mountain and he is India's pride and reply to the Hollywood's own heavyweight, James Cameron. Rana Daggubati as Bhallala Deva succeeds in portraying the most vicious villain in recent times, a role that defines his dedication and skills. while Sathyaraj as Kattappa and Ramya Krishnan as Rajmata Sivagami, produces the most iconic and loved roles in their illustrious career. Anushka Shetty brings her ever-lasting beauty and class to the role of Devasena, the warrior princess and Nassar is marvelous in portraying the manipulative Bijjaladeva and Subbaraju is loved by everyone for his role as Kumara Varma. Tamannaah was like an angel from heaven in previous film, but this time she shows the Heart to play a small role with full support.And there is no words to describe \"The Man\" who plays the Legendary Baahubali.. Prabhas is splendid and glorious on the Grand Stage. Prabhas lives in our heart as the the man who refuses to loose while keeping the morals sky high... A role that makes him an electrifying sensation all over India and around the Globe...BGM of M.M. Keeravani is on an another level that makes our blood boil, makes our eyes teary and thrill our nerves again and again. Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao edits the movie flawlessly and stunts by King Solomon, Lee Whittaker, Kecha, and Peter Hein are jaw-dropping. Combination of Makuta VFX, Senthil Kumar's Cinematography, Sabu Cyril designs and Rajamouli's Vision makes this an extra-ordinary silver- screen extravaganza. A big salute to the produces Shobu Yarlagadda and Prasad Devineni for showing a wide open mind to let loose Rajamouli and showing faith in him to makes this alluring movie on a humongous budget.Baahubali Franchise benefits from the unique gathering of talented individual who brings with them, unmatched dedication and hard work...Father-Son Team of Vijayendra Prasad and Rajamouli, masterfully weaves the story in a gripping and intense way...and when good face-off with evil in this tale, when the light tries to strike down the darkness in this saga, And when the \"Unstoppable Force\" Prabhas clash Head-On with the \"Immovable Mountain\" Rana Daggubati in this epic, it results in shattering of box-office records and will leave you wanting more....Rajamouli shows nothing is impossible when you have the heart and his right-hand man Prabhas brings soul to the film with his charming screen presence, his signature Smile (a symbol of honesty) and truthfully living (not acting nor playing) the larger-than-life Hero Baahubali... A heart-felt thanks for each and every person behind and on the screen for making this superior movie and i recommend everyone to watch in theaters as early as possible with family to experience this smack-dab, adrenaline pumping, high-spirited once in a decade Movie...",

The characters in the film have just not acted but have given out their soul to this movie. I rated this 9/10 because some songs and over-special effects were unnecessary. But the essence and the strong characters and their high voltage action and power packed performance truly surpasses everything. I am from Mumbai and I strongly feel that Bollywood lacks talent unlike South movies and its time for Bollywood to retrospect what they have done or been doing and do it better and not just think about few bucks. I am proud this movie have contributed a gem to the India cinema and certainly forced the viewers to think of their taste and standards about the watching any movie in future. At- last accepting that I have become a huge fan of Rajamouli, Prabhas, Rana,Anushka.",

            "content": "first of all hats off to SS Rajamouli for his vision and I would also like to thank his father for giving such a wonderful story.Bahubali 2 is a product which nearly impossible in bollywood for many reasons one of them is that their movies usually lack originality ,they use to copy south Indian movies and even Hollywood movies second reason is that the actors use to charge heavy fees for their roles hence even if the budget of the movie is high the main part of the budget goes in fee payment of the actors while if we talk about prabhas in this movie he charged 25 crores for both the movies and also they use to get it in the form of monthly payment so that there could be no affect on the movie's production.Hence there are some things that bollywood needs to rethink after bahubali's success. Now coming to the movie ,these type of movies usually come once in 20 years and nobody should loose the opportunity of watching this movie in theaters as it is the sholay of our generation that we will be always proud of and also we would proudly have something to share amongst our next generation.And yes thank you rajamouli sir for bringing this gem to the Indian cinema and making India proud.",

            "content": "Speechless. The most breathe taking film ever. A 3 hours voyage to the world of wonders, To the world of glory and fantasy. Some few points I must mention here regarding this film. 1.First of all Indian cinema has a bad past record and rumour that they can't make sequels. S.S Rajamouli has just smashed this with his master creation Bahubali 2. I am not going to the debate whether it's a sequel or prequel but it is the only film whose second part is the actual continuation of its prequel. 2.The fabulous starting. It just captured my eye within a second. For the first time in the Hollywood film \"Avengers Age of Ultron (2015)\" At the end of the film all the characters were represented as a marble statue. Same was done in Bahubali 2 at the starting. What a mind blowing work of art. 3.The Shooting sets. It's just outstanding. Beyond imagination. The architectural view and the glorifying \"Mahishmati Dynasty\" was like a creation of God. Each and every architecture and film sets were so nicely created that it seems to be real one. 4.The Love story of Amarendra Bahubali and Devasena added a new feather in this movie. The sacrifice of Bahubali and leaving the throne for his love captured hearts truly. 5.The dialogues and the background score were just piercing through my heart. They are so sharp and full of weight-age. Basically the background music itself created a wary environment which is telling the story of a warrior throughout the film. 6.Nothing to say about Prabhas or Anushka Shetty. They did something beyond fantastic. Really Spellbound. 7.Last but not the least the VFX and CGI. I think it is an open challenge to the best war movies of Hollywood like \"The Lord of the Rings series\" or \"The Gladiator\". The war sequence, each fighting scene was breathe taking. Even I was just engulfing the scenes with utmost hunger. Take a bow Rajamouli Sir. You are not only a director but You are an artist who has created a dream land and gifted it to Indian Cinema. It is a milestone which will be a Guide for all upcoming films to teach all how to capture billions of hearts within a second.",

Rajamouli,Rana,Prabhas and lots of love for the beautiful Devsena.......Go and watch it.An absolute family entertainer.",

The composition, costumes and settings of the movie are fantastic and beyond anything that has been done in Indian cinema till date. I have heard screams saying that Sholay was the greatest Indian movie ever. I agree that Sholay was one of greatest Bollywood movies ever but there is no comparison here. Sholay had a gripping storyline and great actors including superstars. For Bahubali, the actors have mostly performed well but is Rajamouli that takes the cake here for his Amar Chitra Katha and the sequences, sets and some fantastic scenes that you would want to see over and over again. For those Bollywood aficionados who do not know Rajamouli or any of the numerous South Indian movies, you guys know very little about Indian cinema. Indian cinema may begin in Bollywood but it does not end there. Regional movies, many a times are far more superior when it comes to direction and mostly acting skills. Bahubali 1 and 2 both are worthy enough to go and watch in a Cinema hall with the whole family. If not twice, at least once. I am 50 years old, born in India but living in Canada since 2001, and this was only our second non TV movie that we went out and watched. The movie was a rave when it got released, with people queuing up outside theaters to buy tickets. Tickets were at a premium the first week.",

I sat there thinking this is just as bad as the first part, however the movie picks up in a big way. Its nothing we have not seen before, classic historic story of power, greed and betrayal but done in a grand manner.The global question of why Kathappa killed Bahubali is finally answered, the whole execution of the scene for me was masterful, handled very well indeed.So in summary a good movie with a grand scale and a bunch of good actors.",

Baahubali 2 deserves the credit that it had got all across the world.This was not an exaggeration but this movie created a revolution across the film world. I'm writing this review from Germany and I could see the appreciation from many Non-Indians and local citizens.The Direction and story are the two main strong points of the film.The Director SS Rajamouli had delivered a true masterpiece on the lines of mythological characters.The Power of narration backed up with the huge strength and powerful screen presence of characters is truly magnificent.Personally, this movie had given a story to tell to our kids & grand kids. When was the last time and an Indian movie is most spoken about by various film fraternities? It is a proud Indian film because it was appreciated by Hollywood, Chinese film critics too. A proud Indian film which had imprinted it's foot mark very strong & it is still going strong with a box office of #1300 crore and counting. This is a perfect example of master story telling, grand narration & how to deliver a perfect background score. When the whole world stands up and applauds the magnificence of the film, isn't it a pride moment for our Indians?.Instead, I could see a series of horribly criticizing reviews rating the movie badly. Baahubali 2 cannot be judged and cannot be reviewed, It has to be celebrated because a new bench marks have been set.It stands as an epitome of 5 years of hard work by a crew of 5000 men and women who worked day in and day out to create such a grand spectacle. When International journalism can appreciate Baahubali 2 for it's success, we need to savior the success of the film. We have our own superheroes from mythological epics like Ramayana & Mahabharata. Baahubali comes under the same category. The Film is an exceptional masterpiece with Prabhas delivering exceptional heroic performance, Anushka Shetty looks brilliant in Devasana role, Ramya Krishna powers life into Sivagami, Rana looks exceedingly devilish as Bhallaladeva & last but not least Sathya Raj(Kattappa) forms the crux of many emotional sequences.My rating is 10 star as we have never witnessed such a film in recent times. It is worth watching on the big screen and live the experience.",

Belongs to one of the best narrations in history along with 'shawshank redemption', 'Avatar', 'Interstellar' ..etc. You will not feel like its more than 2 hour long movie.I see that some people didn't like the action sequences. I feel that, any superman movie will have those kind of unreal sequences. Its something we have accepted many times in history. 'Emotion'. This is the secret of this movie's success. Director is successful in binding audience to the emotions of the characters. Right from 'Titanic' to 'Interstellar', its been that secret ingredient. CGI(Graphics) are just a part of story telling. The soul of the movie is in 'carrying Emotions'.Its a movie that should be in your Library. No matter what race, religion, country you belong to. Its a 'must watch' for all the aspiring Film Makers. Saaho !! :)",

Well no pun intended and this sequel to the other movie called Bahubali (not sure if this is a legend written in books, I only watched the movies to be honest), was another stepping stone to get to RRR. A movie that is more likely to be remembered for a way longer period of time than this.That being said, this is well made. The effects do work, though you may be used to something better I reckon. The story is quite simple. There is an interesting twist/angle with our main character or rather actor and how it is being resolved when it comes to his antagonist.That being said, there is a lot of crazy stunts in this ... and for what its worth, visually you can not fault this movie in any sense. Question is, if you are up for something like this. Seems like enough people who dig this watched it. And it is different, maybe a breath of fresh air as some might say too.Colorful and as mad as you can imagine - maybe even more so. Just try it out, if you are bored of the same ol same ol ... but don't expect this to be completely free of cliches too.",

I'm very picky of watching movies, but this movie certainly made through the final and I enjoyed every scene. Yes, there are few scenes or animations that can be better., but we all know the world is not perfect. If you want to compare this with a Hollywood movie, it will fall short, but certainly this movie takes our movie industry to much higher levels. This will be a game changer to how our directors usually think. Rajamouli had proved that we can be a very competent industry to Hollywood. We have raised the bar, and lets keep it there.Few accolades here -Characters - Sivagamini is amazing. And I became a fan of Amarendra Baahubali. Art work - WOW..!!! This is simply amazing.Background score / Music - Emotional and every scene is live with background score.Especially during first and early second half of the movie.Designer (Wardrobe etc) - New feast for Women / Men to hang on for the next months. Done really well.Proud of Rajamouli and Baahubali team. Tollywood showcased our talent to the world.Lastly, please watch this movie in theatre only. Avoid and fight piracy.Thanks Rajamouli sir for an amazing entertainment film that would stick with us for decades.",

I enjoyed the background music, scenes, story and acting so much then watched 3 more times in the theater. So, obviously was expecting a big bang for the conclusion part. To start with, It is highly entertaining, It was all about bahubali's life. I felt when the movie came back to present time's scene, where it ended in the previous film - it was rushed too quick for the ending war. 5 minute should have been spared extra to develop it further. And some mistakes are there such as little too unreal fight stunts, and army against the few thousands etc. They should have spent that 5 min and let the army divide little more upon seeing mahendra bahubali. But, I won't take anything away, as there are rarely any movies which are made perfect. Enjoy this Film only in Theater with Dolby Atmos!",

The story was more detailed than the first film and held my attention better. It felt like a superhero or mythological story so there was a lot of drama, action, history, and cultural elements along with a healthy dose of abilities that seemed supernatural or magical.What I took issue with: There was a plot hole from the first film that revolved around the love story between Shivudu and Avanthika. It never came full circle in the end and I wanted to see that. The use of CGI was good but a bit heavy at times. It was visually stunning but it almost seemed as though I was watching an animated film at times causing it to lose some of it's realism. There were several musical numbers and while I realize that is a staple of Bollywood films, I'm just not used to it and it makes the films seem a bit long for me.Both films combined get a 7.5 star rating from me. I wouldn't mind suggesting it to some one who is into hero, mythology or creative CGI films.",

Even though it has 9 rating but was surprised to some 1 rating hate reviews. This is my first review ever on IMDb and i am writing this review to counter some of their points. Many are criticizing action of the movie saying that it defies logic and law of physics. This is a period fantasy film and should be judge on the same basis as other period fantasy films such as lord of the rings,300,troy etc. Action of the film is similar to these films. In real life only 1 punch in the throat is enough to hurt someone and by this logic 99% action and period fantasy are illogical. I think these people do not know how to review period fantasy action genre. Some are saying that film has thin plot and weak story. This movie has so many interesting plot lines, love story of Devasena and Baahubali is shown in such a exotic way. How equation between Baahubali and Sivagami changes.Interaction between Devasena and Sivagami are so real and fascinating.Baahubali and Kattappa shared uncle nephew kind of relationship yet Kattappa had to kill Baahubali.This movie has better story then mindless fast and furious series, the avengers series and the hobbit series movie.

Well, I assure you, the wait for that answer was worth more than the stunts, songs or a budget of 2.5 billion INR.. It probably was a combination of one of the most emotionally and frustratingly epic scene I've ever witnessed in Indian cinema.. Just the grandeur of that one scene gave for some goosebumps; for some a prolonged tear jerker; and for some absolute silence with awe.The Conclusion is helmed on 5 shoulders.. #Prabhas, #Sathyaraj, #RanaDaggubati, #AnushkaShetty and #RamyaKrishan, who have all done their parts well. But the strength of the movie is Prabhas who literally lived the character. The support cast have all done their parts brilliantly.3 hours 15 minutes: Having watched it in Bahrain, I was surrounded with the thrill of sitting in a cinema in India; whistles, claps and howls of joy; every scene was celebrated.This movie had a good mix of soulful songs, witty one liners, amazing sound effects, bgm, beautiful locations (both original and visually created), grand sets, hard hitting stunts and touching moments placed aptly.I had read earlier that the VFX is in par with #TheLordOfTheRings and #HarryPotter.. I would say it is top notch for Indian cinema. Although I did not understand a word, I watched this movie in the language it was conceived - Telugu. Wanted to keep it as original as possible.

The acting was decent and fight sequences were good. Bahuballi is a superhero with super powers.However, after the movie ended I felt that this movie has a bad effect on society. Apart from the points mentioned above there are too many negative points about this movie.Here are reasons why I hate this movie.1) The 2 protagonists are shown with insanely huge muscles. Tell me, what if you were to see a movie in which women have insanely huge boobs. Would you accept that editing? You would not. Why is it not okay to objectify women's bodies and okay to do it for mens? This isn't any ordinary atheltic hero. Both of them are shown as \"normal guys\" but with mammoth muscles. That is objectifying. If you show him completely as a superhero then it's not objectifying. But if you show him as an ordinary guy + superhero muscles then that is objectifying.2) What scenes are shown in the whole movie? Randomly pause the movie at any scene and you'll find either of these emotions: romance, heroism, war, mother crying. There is nothing else in the movie. This is why I feel that it's an animalistic movie. Remember spartacus? Along the same lines.3) What was the need to show a weak king and Bahuballi hunting along with him? The need was to show contrast and hence a bigger hero. For example, if I'm just doing parkour then it's not so sensational. Put me around someone who's scared of heights and suddenly it's more dramatic.4) The ending scenes. I won't add any spoilers but I just want to say that it was pathetic. The way the whole scene plays out it just shows pure machoism and heroism. There's no story here.",

I had seen the prequel in the theatre and had been waiting for this movie to come out ever since. It got delayed by a year. At first I was mad because the Baahubali: The Beginning said 2016 in the end, and the year was already going too bad. But finally it came in 2017, so I guess that makes it better.And just like Baahubali: The Beginning, this one also felt legendary. Not like a cheap sequel the way successful movies make, but an actual conclusion we had all been hoping for. The question as to why Katappa killed Baahubali was answered in the most spectacular way possible. We finally got to see how Baahubali met Devasena and why he was banished from Mahishmati. The action scenes were even better than the previous movie, and it concluded without any sequel baiting.I see why there are so many negative reviews over here. This movie can only be truly enjoyed in a theatre. It won't have the same impact when being watched on a TV or phone. It needs a huge audience to cheer, a perfect environment to be absorbed and the satisfaction we get after we spend a good amount of money to watch a movie.I am really hoping this saga has come to an end. They should not make more movies unless it is really necessary. We already have the perfect duology and having more than what we need will only ruin its image which we obviously don't wish to see. This movie deserves the same love as we give to all our ancient scriptures, because that is the vision which SS Rajamouli had while making this, and it's very much apparent when we watch this movie.",

After watching it, my expectations were not completely satisfied. Here are a list of pros and cons that I feel are worth mentioning about this film.Pros:Background Music/Songs: M.M. Keeravani does an excellent job composing the background score and music for the songs, crafting a beautiful, melodious composition in \"Kanna Nee Thoongadaa\" while offering a worthy tribute to Amarendra Baahubali in the riveting \"Bale Bale Baahubali\". The rest of the songs are aptly composed as well, and they don't significantly detract the overall progression of the film.Special Effects: Rajamouli had a grand vision when designing this film, and it shows. The kingdoms are bigger, the songs are fancier, and the action is grander. It is really breathtaking in my opinion. Acting: Prabhas is bold and effective in his two roles. The only flaw that I found within his performance was near the beginning of the film, which I will address more closely within the follies associated with the plot. Rana serves as a perfect foil against Prabhas i, emoting the necessary arrogance, built-up vengeance, and masculinity that the role requires of him. Anushka Shetty portrays Devasena very well, displaying her fiery independent thinking and provocativeness alongside Prabhas. Cons:Plot: The movie's story is obviously quite clich\u00e9d, but that is to be expected with a movie that is focused on showcasing its grand visuals and portraying the final encounter between Baahubali and Bhalladeva. However, the first half was dragged out tremendously. In particular, there is a long sequence involving Baahubali and Kattapa that will make you question what Rajamouli was thinking. Other important plot developments, such as the relationship between young Mahendra Baahubali, are not explored. Furthermore, Devasena's role in the second half of this movie will undoubtedly raise some eyebrows, as she is heavily underutilized while the melodrama starts to kick in.Acting: Other than a few scenes of kicking ass, Tamannah is rendered useless. Sathyaraj, while a phenomenal actor, is grossly wasted in the first half of the film alongside Prabhas during that particular sequence of events. Special Effects: The action scenes are yet again ridiculous, which I wasn't really expecting. Prabhas completing a 360 in the air was laughable. Soldiers being launched off catapults was quite interesting, but that's not going to cut it for the amount of money spent on VFX. Overall, a decently satisfying movie in that it met my bare expectations. However, my loftier expectations were unfulfilled. Watch this movie once it pops up on Einthusan or a similar film streaming website. Don't try to pay money to watch this.Overall Rating: 5.5/10",

Despite having an ordinary story, they are the top notch performances and visuals that make this worth watching. You enjoy it thoroughly and in the end you have to say \"I don't care how illogical the story was, I am going to watch this again and again.\" This is the power of Baahubali, Bhallaldeva, Devasena and all. They don't let you to rest your eyes away. South Indian film industry has always transcended liberties in depicting action sequences. The hero would touch a villain and he would land on some other planet. Baahubali too has such moments, although in limit. Devasena swings her sword and people around start performing acrobatics as if they are seriously hurt, Baahubali runs on an inclined plank without landing his feet etc. However lets keep these things aside and enjoy this great film. Cheers!!",

The story is now clear: we have a mashimati kingdom whose reign is in the hand of a mother queen who nursed a child called Bahubali,and her other son from the blood. When this son begins seeing the rise of Bahubali,and his popularity among the commons, the envy starts taking over him and it culminates when Bahubali is pronunced king by the mother queen. Bahubali is a soft hearted,compassionate person but his brother has a kinda of an evil posessive aura to him.this sorta kinda evil son is getting cajoled by his father that is constantly implanting thoughts in his head. When Bahubali goes to another kingdom and fall in love with a proncess there, he becomes torn apart between his loyalty to his mother and protecting the dignity of his lover that had rejected his brother even though she was sent all sorts of riches by the mother queen. Before the mother queen, Bahubali has to make a decision to either denounce his throne or marry his lover. He choose the latter and from now on te father and the now king son start concocing a death plan Bahubali. They finally succeded in convincing the mother of giving her assent amd have Bahubali's uncle murder him. The uncle later found out the king's deceit and help the mother get out safely with Bahubali's newborn son while his mother stayed detained at the pal\u00e0ce. Bahubali, comes back by climbing a very high waterfalls,meeting the love of his life,and discovering his true identity.\nThe battle are one of the most epic battles i've seen. And i have seen epic battles in GOT and avengers. Also,the music and the choreography in the movie are just amazing. Totally worth watching.",

The beauty and talents of Anushka Shetty as Devasena the warrior princess, will have you at the edge of your seat as she mows down her enemies, all without a hair going out of place. To the enticing, enchanting beauty of Tamannaah as Avantika; whether dressed as a warrior with fire burning in her eyes and a sword in her hands, or as alluring and gorgeous as an angel as she stands beside Mahendra Baahubali dressed as a queen (Amarendra Baahubali's son with Devasena who is also played by Prabhas).This movie has it all, epic battles of absolutely massive scale, special effects that are award worthy, a cast that oozes talent and a story so captivating I set through both movies one after the other without a break.An extremely well deserved 10/10 from me!

The lady characters are so splendidly portrayed with a mind of their own.

The movie revolves around 2 brothers,their competition as to throne ascending.SS Rajamouli's Bahubali 1 and Bahubali 2 has pretty good resemblance to Mahabharata and its storyline. The way he presented this magnum opus project with details on characters and story makes it more interesting.What I loved:: 1.Ideas and beautiful framing for that ideas::Unique ideas with absolute importance to each frame is what I loved and I am going to give one after the other a.Movie start with 3d animation work of last movie to give idea of what all happened. b.Stopping elephant rampage by using Elephant God(Lord Ganesha) c.Bahubali climbing elephant and then elephant picks up bow for baahubali to fire the arrow d.Introduction for beautiful Anushka as Devasena(been her fan since her 1st movie Super) e.Bahubali and Kattapa fight scene syncing and sharing the weapon. f.Making beautiful Anudhka more gorgeous. g.Showing Devasena picture to Sivagami h.Providing importance to female character by showing Devasena is independent and brave i.Firing three arrow at same time reminded me of wonder woman first fight sequence but still had authenticity. j.Firing 6 arrows using both actors at same time from 1 bow k.Baahubali intro to Devasena l.Grand intro of Makishmadhi(even though reminded of LOTR sort of statues) and intro of Devasena to court m.Throne ascending cermony(reminded me of Independence day parade) but still great n.Devasena being chained and Bahubali cutting of head o.Introducing Mahendra bahubali baby as new King.Now the scenes I felt had to be modded or things I didn't like at all:: 1.Look Bahubali 1 and 2 the crowd consists of same people with same exaggerated version of happiness and sadness throughout. 2.Crowd(especially women cry throughout) when Sivagami walks,when bahubali eats their food(were they feeling pity towards him or for sharing food)or during Bahubali ascension as commander 3.Bahubali being a dumb guy 4.Kattapa being lowered to all hailing side kick and trying to be cupid :P 5.Cows/bulls on fire just vanishes during the dam destruction scene 6.Too much fear in the cousin fellow to bring in laughs 7.It was a moment to show crowd wanted bahubali it seemed like crowd were actually howling and making noise while his ceremony 8.Prince of Egypt(based on Moses the Ten Commandments) sort of scenes where he goes off to poor people and live with them and engineers many mechanism 9.strechable palm trees to shower water. 10.things for fighting being there at the right moment and place to defeat enemies while kattapa gets saved 11.Overacting(anger) by mahendra bahubali after hearing story 12.OMG the scene where he bends the palm tree to throw human catapult definitely made me feel gross 13.More to that 4 people catapulted lands on feet,hits the weapons,artilleries etc...... 14.One scene reminded old Mahabrata arrow sequence, that being bahubali and bhallaldeva throwing spear and bahubali spear breaks bhalladeva's spear and goes through it 15.Bhalladeva crying not to burn him(maybe they wanted to show inside he is a coward) but still it felt unnecessary 16.While the golden head of bhalladeva falls downhill the animation was I think given least importance.These were my impressions.If you like it please click like.THanks in advance",

            "review_title": "The Conclusion Misses its Mark",
            "content": "**Just a small disclaimer: This is my honest opinion after watching the movie. If you agree with me, great. If you don't agree with me, that is great as well. All in all though, kudos to Rajamouli and the Bahubali team for finishing this arduous journey. It may not be a masterpiece, but it has set a level for Indian cinema. Honestly speaking, after watching the first movie, I wasn't entirely convinced with the story line, as it was weak. Compared to the present-day story, I liked the past story (With Baahu and Bhalla) much better. So, I was expecting more with this movie since this movie mainly focuses on the past. With a higher budget and a two-year wait, I expected more, but I felt that this movie missed on its mark to deliver. But before discussing the negatives, I would like to justify why this movie earned a 6 instead of a 3 or 4: -After the disaster with Avantika in the first movie where they show the transformation of her from being a soldier to a \"woman,\" I must appreciate that Anushka's character, Devasena, is a strong and formidable woman. No one tries to change her, and Bahubali respects her greatly, which is a great improvement from the first movie. In many ways, Devasena truly stole the show with her dominance and grace in the same way as Shivagami stole the show in the first movie. -Amarendra Bahubali was also shown as a powerful character. In the first movie, I thought his characterization was quite weak (dancing with girls while drunk never won me over in the first movie), but in this movie Rajamouli and his team seem to have taken the effort and care to show Bahubali as the hero he is. -Prabhas and Anushka's acting and synchronization, especially when they fight with the bow and arrows, was wonderful. Their chemistry was sizzling. In fact, it was convincing enough that I understood why Devasena made the decisions she did to support Bahubali. -The duet song between Bahubali and Devasena had great CGI. The song wasn't great, but the visualization was. -This is a minor point, but I actually liked the animation style they used in the beginning when they recapped the audience with what happened in the first movie. Negatives: -The soundtrack was not good. I never connected to any of the songs and they distracted from the plot. But keeping that in mind, I don't think the BGM is bad -The CGI, especially with the animals, was not as crisp as the first movie. In a lot of scenes, I could tell there was CGI, and that was distracting. Also, I felt in some scenes, they unnecessarily used CGI for the sake of using it instead of using it because it promoted the plot. -The action scenes were disappointing. One of the reasons I liked Bahubali: The Beginning was because of the battle scene between the Mahishmati Kingdom and the Kalakeya Kingdom. The cloth and fire to destroy the enemies was innovating and unique. But in this one, everything seemed mediocre and normal. Not what I expected since this is the \"great\" battle scene that everyone has waited 2 years for. Technically speaking, this fight occurs more than 25 years after the Kalakeya invasion, so technology and thinking/battle strategies should have improved by then, hopefully. -The pacing of the movie was awful. The movie dragged with Prabhas's and Anushka's romance, but then it was as if everything was fast-forwarded since they had to show that Anushka's pregnancy to pave the path for Shivudu's story. Honestly, it went from \"Amma, I want to marry Devasena,\" to \"Amma, I hope you come to Devasena's baby shower.\" If you blinked, you would've missed their marriage. -\"Why did Kattapa kill Bahubali?\" It was the great question that plagued everyone's minds at the end of the first movie. For a two- year wait, though, the reason was pretty pathetic and predictable to say in the least, and the screenplay of showing how this all unfolds was a disappointment. Again, I think the pacing was the reason why everything was unbelievable. -The biggest disappoint, and perhaps why I really did not enjoy this movie, was that Rajamouli really neglected everyone except Bahubali, Devasena, and Kattapa. Honestly, those three were the only that mattered, since everyone else was just a prop. The characters that were shown to be powerful, like Shivagami and Bhalla, were characters that I ridiculed. They were powerless, and at times I wondered if they had brains. Because of this disconnect, I honestly wondered at a point if a different writer wrote the script because of the characterizations, to me at least, were polar opposites. Because Rana's character was \"dumb,\" the fight scene was not as epic as it should have been. I would've liked to see the powerful bull-fighting Bhalla fight Shivudu, but instead, a crazy king fought Shivudu. Moreover, Shivagami was honestly used as a plot device to move forward. She was cynical and egoistic, and nothing like the powerful Queen she was before. It was a real disappoint to see these two, both my favorites from the first movie, be degraded into plot-devices instead of the characters they are. And coming to Tammannaah, she might as well have been edited out of the movie since she was there for two seconds. Bottom Line: This was truly a disappointment from the first movie. It is definitely not worth the two years wait or the $30 that I paid since the CGI and plot were mediocre. The first movie was much more polished and well-thought out than this one. But, Prabhas and Anushka do steal the show and for them at least it is a one-time watch.",

Though the sequel is a step-up in regards with narration and plot play, it just can't seem to escape the mediocrity set by it's predecessor. The dramatic sequences are a relief in this movie with action sequences that defy logic and basic physics at every step. There should've been some kind of explanation such as Amarendra Baahubali was the son of Zeus or that he was injected with super strength serum or that he was stuck by lightning or that he was simply an alien who feeds on the Sun's radiation. Such explanation would've made his physics defying feats a little less distracting and acceptable. Also, the movie could've had many more options as the title. My recommendations are as follows: Baahubali: Defying Laws of Physics Baahubali: The Annihilator of Trees Baahubali: The Invulnerable Baahubali: Mowgli from Maahismathi Baahubali: One Man Army So on and so forth.The story sure is ages old, I'm not even gonna touch that as it was quite evident from the first part itself. The movie is filled with two dimensional characters except for Sivagami. The characters do not have a grey area, making it tougher to relate to them. The first part had strategic approach to war. This movie steals away that too. War apparently needs just will power and a really super powered being who is the result of crossing Superman and Flash. S.S. Rajamouli has single-handedly questioned the concept of Fort Walls and Medieval Ballistic Weapons. If you can throw humans into the fort using a tree, why did Greeks ever build all the weapons to break the goddamn walls! If a single man with a giant hammer can break a chain that is twice his size and holds the door to the fort, what is the point of the door? Yeah, our film makers seriously need basic classes on Human Autonomy and Physics.

The movie is of fantasy genre and one should not seek for utter originality in those.There are frequent scenes that defy gravity and various laws of Physics,but not to a great extend.The movie includes violence and gore(as required).The Vfx and other associated works are worth mentioning.I personally liked the movie because of the way the story turns with a set of events,and the thickness of the core characters.First half is a bit lazy but the second half is really an entertainer...",

Story is predictable but has been presented well to keep in the seat the whole time. I loved the background score, loved the screenplay (brilliant screenplay). Story is same as Mahabharata with some twists. Actors have done so much of work for this movie. I think Rana Daggubatti was the best among of all of the actors. Prabhas, Anushka Shetty, Ramya were good along with SathyaRaj and Nassar. The only bad thing about the movie is part of Shivu (Bahubali) spending time in the state of Devasena. I think they should have made it a little shorter so that movie would have been a lil bit shorter. SS Rajamouli stretched that part a lil bit. Other than that its really good. Worth the time and money. This movie should be watched in theater. DO NOT WAIT TO WATCH AT HOME.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: I am not a movie expert, critic or any one who knows any aspect of movie making.I as one of the movie audience having watched the movie is writing this review to express my opinion towards the movie.I have been checking the reviews and responses over the last two days for Baahubali 2. Most responses were positive but some were critical and some negative and the reviewers ratings were a 5/5, a 4/5, a 3.5/5, a 3/5 and a 2/5 ratings for the movie and do you believe all of them are correct.I was concerned, wondering what was the movie was like seeing the average, negative rating for the movie by some.And finally I watched the movie yesterday(29th Apr'17) spending 500/- per ticket for a twelve of us. Every rupee, I mean every rupee was worth it seeing the movie.I don't know about goosebumps, this is what I felt, my heart filled with awe, ecstasy, emotions and much more (I am short of words here) at the same time. And this feeling stayed through out the movie right from the start to the end. Never before I had such a feeling, seeing a movie. Felt like not a pin to point at any aspect of the movie and I wouldn't ever get bored seeing the movie a 100 times more.What more can you ask for, what more do you expect ? The movie has few influences from \"Baajirao Mastani\", with a scene where bulls with fire torched horns made to run as part of a war ploy. And another from Brave with a scene where a spear piercing another spear while it is an arrow piercing another in Brave.The movie is flawless in its story, dialogues and a sheer brilliance of innovative warfare techniques, ideas and stunning visuals. Rajamouli could very well patent the ideas.Unanswered question: Who is the father of Devasana ? Movie does not reveal this, by hindsight I think it is reserved for Baahubali 3.Now I want to go through the reviews, comments made with critical nature, negativity and blast them all. Before I do that, I want to say this.No man is ever perfect, he is one who strives for it and if he is perfect he is only God and no one. Baahubali, as a movie with its director Rajamouli, his father Vijayendra Prasad the script writer, his supportive producers, dream actors and his entire film unit are only few notches near perfection to visualize, narrate and show Baahubali as the Mr.Perfect King and god in the movie.You wouldn't say my above line is an exaggeration if you have seen the movie. But if you do, I feel you would need to be literate to read and understand a good book. Likewise what would you need to be, if you would need to see and understand a good movie, I will leave it to you.Below are few of the critical reviews of Baahubali 2 along with my comments for them. Rather than blasting, I just want pick the genuine feedback in them, correct the lack of knowledge in feedback and trash the rest.Rating 2/5: The Indian Express Movie Review: Author's comment: \"The background music is relentless, and the pitch at which the declamatory dialogues are delivered is deafening: there were times I felt like closing my ears\". My comment: To some extent agree, Sound engineering could have been better with the likes of a technician like Oscar award winner Resul Pookutty.Rating 3/5: Business Standard movie review: Baahubali 2 - The Conclusion is a colossal bore: Author's comment: \"The first 60 minutes of the movie are slow and the comedy track involving Subba Raju as the simple-minded cousin of Devasena barely evokes any laughs.\" My comment: Seeing the movie in telugu, I felt not one dialogue in the comedy track missed its comic timing. I don't know about the dubbed versions. The authors entire review looks a mud slinging effort at a great movie.Rating 3.5/5: Idle brain movie review by Jeevi: Author's comment: \"VFX by Makuta is very good, but not as fine as part 1.\" My comment: Agree, few scenes with VFX in the climax could have been better made with more fluidity. Author's comment: \"On the flipside, pace slows down in second half and climax appear extended.\" My comment: Many other reviews also opined climax is dragged, but Rajamouli, the master story teller is telling a story finishing into the climax and none can better him. Everyone knows Balladeva will be killed but 'how' is the climax. Climax only rather looks speedy with few sequences would have been cut down to contain the movie under 2hr 47 mins.",

People were assuming in their own way...Lots of people became fan of Prabhas, Ramya Krishnan and Rana Daggubati after watching the part 1...They were thinking what will be the story of part 2?... How Anushka Shetty will look as younger Devasena?... Most of the non-Indians like me who did not watch South Indian Films before, were thinking will the pairing of Prabhas and Anushka look odd?... Because Anushka played the character of Mahendra's mother in part 1 and she will romance with Baahubali in part 2...And we all know both Baahubali and Mahendra's characters are portrayed by Prabhas...But I was so wrong...'PraNushka' is the best pair of Indian film currently...In 90's & zero decade I had lots of favorite pairs, as SRK used to look good with every actresses such as - Madhuri, Preity, Kajol, Rani, Sushmita, Aishwarya, Karishma, Juhi, Twinkle, Mahima...I just love SRK's pairing with these actresses so much...But unfortunately that Bollywood no longer exists now...After watching Baahubali, I became a fan of South Indian films...That's why I have started watching Telugu, Malayalam, Tamil and Kannada films...After watching a lot of South Indian films, still PraNushka is my most favorite on screen couple...They looked good in \"Billa\" and\" Mirchi\" as well...I also love the pairing of Prabhas with Tapshee, Kajal, Tamannaah, Asin and Trisha...But among them Prabhas and Anushka are magical...In addition to, I personally think South Indian film industries are making best movies currently...I used to watch Hindi and Indian Bengali films...But these two industries are not doing well currently...As I have become a fan of South Indian films after watching Baahubali, it's like the first love to me...That's why I can't stand anything against Baahubali and Baahubali 2...I came to read the reviews  and I was kind of shocked!... Why so much of hatred?... The story is very good and the direction is outstanding...S. S. Rajamouli did a brilliant job...Till now I will say these two parts of Baahubali are his best movies...Lots of iconic characters are there such as - Amarendra Baahubali, Devasena, Bhalladeva, Shivagami, Katappa etc...In part 1, I love most the war and action sequences, and in Part 2, the love story of Devasena and Baahubali is the best...I don't know which one I love most about these two movies - the story, direction, cast, songs, background music, characters, dialogues - each and everything is too good...How can people hate these two movies?... I think people who wrote negative reviews are totally jealous...They don't have any other reason to hate these movies...'Baahubali' is a masterpiece which can be enjoyed again and again...It is a pure classic...We want this type of movies which can satisfy both our eyes and souls.",

He did all his roles perfectly. His dance, jokes, romance, fight, dialogues, body language and everything were awesome. He must get a national award at least for that. Satyaraj played a great role too. His comedies, body language, attitude and dialogues were great too. Rajamouli did a better work in Baahubali 2 than Baahubali 1. BGM was awesome. Songs weren't that good(Considering the scale of the movie), they weren't bad either. Keeravani did a good job with the songs and a great job with the BGM. It doesn't fail to give you goosebumps.

Well coming to the highlights, watch out for a different angle in satyaraj. Anushka looks to have reduced her age by at least five years when she was seen in this movie. Her characterization was top notch. The scenes between Ramya Krishna and Anushka stand a highlight. Prabhas and Rana.. No words, they are the perfect hero villain pair for this movie. No one could have done better. Subbaraju gives the necessary comic relief. What takes this movie is the emotional connect to each character. In Ramya Krishna there is a kind mother and a rock hearted ruler. In Prabhas too there is a spirited warrior and a kind king. Anushka has a quotient of both rajasic and Satwic qualities. What is to appreciate is the friction between these two aspects of every character. Go watch for yourself why kattappa killed bahubali!",

Particularly i like that even though there are still some music-dance moments in it, they're put to amplify the story scenes especially for character developments. It doesn't bother me much like the other typical films. Some scenes maybe a bit foolishly cheesy or seemingly far-fetched but still pretty stylish for a fiction story like this to me. Most importantly though, the director, S. S. Rajamouli exceedingly nailed the action-battle scenes which is just like a hack and slash beat 'em up video game that i haven't seen in a film for quite some time (about 8 years).My critic of the film's the distracting \"CGI\" notifications in some scenes such as the ones featuring animals, i think there's no need for that because besides that it's already mentioned in the start of the film, nowadays the audience can notice easily the nonsensical CGI parts of the film when it's applied. I hear the next film project of this director is gonna be the Mahabharata epic, that's surely an exciting idea which I'm optimistic that it can top this epic. Bring it on!Do you like Hamlet, The Lion King, or other similar tales? Are you a story-driven hack 'n slash RTS hero action adventure video games fan? Either way you'll probably enjoy or adore this.7/10",

Sometimes you could tell they were effects but nonetheless the effects and setting was very beautiful and it's good to see india is trying something new.I think it's overrated but it's not bad. it is very entertaining and effects are pretty good. it is no masterpiece that changes your life, but it's a good movie to enjoy with your family or friends.",

B-1 is for me still one of the great entertaining Indian movies and can stand on its own without the need of this hollow crutch! The good news for me was that I did not rush to the theater as I had initially planned to see this trash but saw on Netflix when they added.

            "content": "I'm writing this review just after watching the movie in the theater. I'm not a movie critic neither do I know how to analyze a movie. All I know about watching a movie is taught to me by this course offered by MIT here http://ocw.mit.edu/21L-011F13 . This is a great course for someone willing to learn about cinematography, screenplay and camera angles and other things related to cinema and direction.I can write a lot about the movie but I won't. I will try to pen down the major takeaways.Before I get into what I thought of the movie let me just tell you that - I wasn't interested in going at all because of the following two reasons: 1. Over the years my interest in movies have dwindled because of the redundant story plots and baseless humour.2. BB1 couldn't impress me much however now after watching BB2 I realized why. Simply because there is a vast difference between watching a movie in theater and at home. I ruined BB1 watching it in poor quality.One of my friend suggested me to watch BB2 in theater or else I might regret it later. I had faith in his choice of movies so decided to give it a shot. Looking back now I'm glad that I went for it.I will break down my review into sections: Plot: I couldn't bear first 25 minutes of the movie and was annoyed to an extent that I wanted to move out of the theater but I was with someone and I couldn't ruin it for him so I endured. But the way the story unfolds after that deserves an applause. Movie climbs to emotional roller coaster just 20 minutes before the interval, then it never stops, or never slows down till the end. The story keeps on getting interesting and the viewer can easily understand that it will keep on getting interesting with the progress. The timing of the interval couldn't be more perfect. I couldn't bear 15 minutes of the interval. I wanted the movie to restart ASAP. During those 15 minutes I kept on guessing what can be the possible plot of the movie further. Somehow the interval got over and the movie restarted. I got hooked to it till the end. The way it grips you is commendable.All in all the plot couldn't have been better than this and the suspense left in the BB1 was decently justified by the plot.Dialogues: I didn't watch the movie in it's original language but still I enjoyed almost every dialogue. \"Sivagami: This is my order. And, my order is the law.\"There were many more and the list is endless but I cannot write all of them here. What added to the charm of the dialogue was the delivery which was near perfect. The dialogues were very well written and gave the feel of actual aura. Acting: Every actor portrayed their role the best they can and what I liked the most was that each and every emotion was conveyed beautifully through the acting. The perfect dialogue delivery coupled with the near perfect acting added to the beauty of it. Be it Shivagami's proud character as a goddess of the empire to an emotional mother, or the Bahu's wife who carried her dignity and pride throughout and how can I forget Rana Duggubati's performance as a cruel king and a great palace politics player. The hatred conveyed by him for his brother through his eyes, actions and body language was great.With all due respect to Anushka Shetty and her performance in the movie, I think a better looking actress could have been chosen for the role. This is something that irked me to an extent.Music: The best thing was that there was no unnecessary melodrama in the songs and the timing of the songs was perfect. Goofs: Six Goofs have been pointed out so for and I was able to notice 5 of them. Here's the link for the Goofs in the movie : http://m.imdb.com/title/tt4849438/goofs? ref_=m_tt_trv_gf . See for yourself how many out of these six you were able to notice.Pre-show advice: Major action scenes in the movie are logical however I would suggest you to keep aside everything that defies it. I bet you will enjoy it more. Do watch BB1 if you have forgotten the plot, however it won't make much of the difference but still it will do some good.My feelings post movie: I wanted a re-watch instantly to get a more closer look. I wanted to feel all those emotions once again. I was the last one to move out of the theater and was still reluctant. It's been more than 18 hours now but the movie is still running inside my brain. It's constantly growing and making an impact.I would advice all of you to watch it and get the feel yourself.P.S. I have rated the movie as 8 because before watching BB2 I had a re watch session of Troy and Braveheart and giving BB2 a perfect score will do injustice to them. For those who know or have read about the history of Scottish people will will be able to connect better with Braveheart. Troy was a classic in every sense and I don't think any other movie will ever be able to beat it in the emotional part. For Braveheart the ending was everything, the dialogues in last 15 minutes of the movie were class apart. I can still vividly recall all the major moments of that movie.This is the first time I've reviewed a movie and I hope that I did justice to it.Thanks a lot for reading.",

We watched the movie and were in awe of everything it had to offer. It gave rise to a question that became a movement for two whole years; \"Why did Kattappa kill Baahubali?\". We could not wait for the sequel. It is here, and boy, was it worth the wait? You bet it was.'Baahubali 2 \u2013The Conclusion' is even better and grander than the first part, and everything is just going to engulf you in its extravagance, as you stare at you IMAX screens, totally stupefied.Firstly, we are not going to give you spoilers, but just going to tell you that Kattappa mystery will indeed leave you stunned. What's more? There is one another blow that will come your way, but we are just going to leave you on a cliff-hanger here. Watch it and thank us for not giving spoilers.The performances are amazing. Prabhas and Anushka Shetty's chemistry is electric, and if possible, even better than the one we witnessed in the first part with Tamannaah Bhatia. Sathyaraj has again surpassed himself as Kattappa. Rana is menacing as the older Bhalladeva and we could not have asked for a more evil antagonist.The effects are even more splendid, Rajamouli has fine-tuned even the slightest glitches that were a part of the first instalment of the series. One also gets to know more about the two very strong female protagonists from the first part, Devasena and Sivagami.All in all, this weekend, go and watch the movie. It is worth your time and money and will offer you all the entertainment along with the taut plot and nerve-raising mystery. We at Eventznu give 'Baahubali 2- The Conclusion' 4/5. It is a fantastical epic which should not be missed.",

Katappa, sure lieutenant of the Mahishmati kingdom and also the subject of cardinal memes, tells the story of Amarendra Baahubali to his son, Mahendra.Prince Bhallaladeva (Rana Daggubati) is taken with jealousy as a result of his mother, Queen Sivagami (Ramya Krishnan) would rather build his full cousin Amarendra her successor. to form matters worse, the blue blood Bhallaladeva desires as his better half would rather marry Amarendra.But once Amarendra and blue blood Devasena (Anushka Shetty) announce their intention to marry, the queen, egged on by her son and husband Bijjaladeva (Nassar), considers the union Associate in Nursing act of defiance and turns her against her selection for king.Rajamouli takes a short time to truly get to the conflict, defrayment virtually 1/2 the movie's runtime putting in the romance between the outspoken individual blue blood and also the smitten patrician. however the action ne'er stops. Amarendra eyes Devasena over searching visits and whereas they demolish entire armies along. She falls for him once he saves her kingdom from Associate in Nursing attack.Rajamouli and author K V Vijayendra Prasad (the director's father) keep the story linear and straightforward, holding the spectacle of rampaging armies, large kingdoms and fight sequences between the 2 leading men do the talking.The VFX, a large attract a movie like this, won't be up to Hollywood standards, however Rajamouli and his team manage to form this world look imposing and spectacular.In fact, if it wasn't for the lighting tricks, the film would in all probability go down as camp and sometimes extraordinary wherever the actors arch their eyebrows at each chance and warriors use palm trees as weapons of war.It is as a result of Rajamouli ne'er lets up in his conceive to deliver a spectacle that must be enjoyed in theatres that \"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion\" may be a worthy conclusion to the present epic series. it should not up the ante from the last film, however it doesn't still on the pace either.

            "content": "Watched the movie yesterday. This movie has a huge production value both in terms of physical sets and the CGI work. The story-line is decent not awesome and the second half becomes predictable. It has celebrated the Indian past with both its good and bad aspects. So if any foreigner were to see this movie, he/she would not get why people love the movie so much despite some very obvious dumb things or over-the-top action scenes. The background scores were awesome but I never like background scores controlling a scene. Prabhas has acted well but the best actor in the movie has to be Anushka Shetty by miles. Over the top action scenes and excessive heroic swag display are a common feature of Telegu cinema which has now become mainstream Bollywood feature too. People seem to love superhero like actions scenes without some scientific explanation of the powers of the characters. Harry Potter can do awesome stuff but I like the fact that Iron Man built a suit and hence can lift heavy stuff. Indian mythology credits divine magical times as the reason for immense powers. The realistic action sequences in the Daredevil series is much more attractive than something between a real wrestling and Shaolin Soccer. The romantic scenes are cheesy. There is always a funny sidekick for the hero in Telegu cinema. This is a sad attempt to make the hero look cool. But people like it so I won't discredit the director. This movie perfectly fits the Indian audience demands. Expecting something different would mean losing the audience. It is very difficult to educate the audience to a better cinema while not losing their interest or being patronizing. Very few movies can do that Baahubali certainly does not seem to aim that. There is little requirement for the first part. Baahubali is a complete three hour movie and did not require a \"Beginning\". The movie had some awesome camera angles and pans. The fight scene at the end was a visual delight. I would have loved to pay the price of the ticket to watch this in BluRay right on my laptop rather than going to the theatre. If only this was made in 3D, which I believe it deserved to be, given the awesome visuals, a theatre experience would be better than at-home experience. Watch in theatre considering the fact that a BluRay version won't be out for months.",

Remember the love interes of the main character from the first movie in the second (this) part she is completely ignored and forgotten. Typical South Indian cinema rajamouli style with ridiculous scenes like using palm trees to jump over city walls not to forget plagarism and terrible CGI. Long boring scenes, some of which made me laugh. Peasants beating a professional army, yes, it makes sense. Not to mention the many goofs this movie has like characters seeing thousand of meters on the battlefield. Enemy chieftan being hit with a large metal object on the head and not dying until beign hit with a mace in the chest yeah makes sense this is only a little bit of this typical style of cinema but it summarizes most of it. Bad acting,meh music,average cinematography.",

Have to say was pretty awed by the first half of the movie- the fact that the director dared to dream of making something this big. The story line of the first half was gripping and the action sequences/ visuals were awesome. However just as the movie goers lost interest in the movie after the answer to THE QUESTION (Why Katappa killed Bahubali) was revealed, looks like the director too lost interest. The rest of the movie seems to have been made without much thought put into it. The war scene at the end was too unrealistic and gory. A little more thought could have been put into it, to make the ending realistic and happier. People who compare the action sequences to English movies like X-Men etc and say ''if you can appreciate superhuman qualities in English movies why can't you do the same for Indian movies?'', here is the answer- X-men and English movies with unrealistic action sequences are blatantly unrealistic from the beginning i.e. the x-men are born with super powers. It is acceptable for superman to do superhuman things. But it is not acceptable for humans to do super human things- there lies the fault!!",

Here, it looks like they fell in love with prabhas and the character and made it, at times, laughable and a bit comical. It sounded self- indulgent. The hero should not have been so morally white and the villain so morally black. But maybe that is just the way indian cinema works and me, a foreigner just does not think on the same lines when it comes to cinema. Noteworthy however, is that the first part has been given a crisp 10 rating by me and it shocks me how this movie is rated higher than the first part. The whole question of \"why did bahubali get killed by katappa\" was, in my opinion, an easy guess. I still love indian cinema and this is good work of art but Mughal- E- Azam still ranks supreme as India's cinematic gift to the world. That movie should be ranked higher and not the same as this movie. Good but comical at times. Maybe the people should watch the movie once and only then release. The story and graphics an acting are the saving face of this movie.",

Does it raise the bar higher than the first part??? A no spoiler review\nThe answer to the above - to a greater part yes but at the same time a bit left wanting. But still keeps you enthralled non the less. Super first half with new adventures action romance but dramatic typical telugu movie drama in the second half with an old wine in an expensive bottle feel to the story. \nThe story picks up from where we left last time and leads up to the story of the ultimate question on everybody's mind why Kattapa did what he did. Well i aint gonna spoil it for you .\nThe first half moves very quickly beginning with a super title sequence akin to the likes of Black Sail and GOT and the introduction of the titular character. This half belongs to the beautiful Anushka Shetty who plays a warrior princess with such aplomb she just lights up the screen with her action scenes and dialogues. Ramya Krishna is super again continuing the role from the first part with the same fierceness and style. Prabhas puts in all that the character requires here with super fight scenes and strong screen presence and shines with able support from Sathyaraj (annoying in some scenes but still good) whose role in the second half is much superior especially leading to THE SCENE. A special mention to the actor playing Kumarasena who has done very well.\nThe second half starts slow with court scenes resembling a play or a stage drama with the language and dialogues but then the pace picks up with all the deceit and plottings leading to the eventual war at the end. This half could have done with some trimming due to its length. The second half brings Rana Dagubatti into the zone with the climax scenes with all his fierceness and raw power as the antagonist with the face and body to match . Nasser provides the Shakuni mama role brilliantly on screen. \nThe long drawn climax is let down with the CGI but the war scenes CGI are so superbly shot that even stunts n effects that defy the laws of Physics and Mathematics will still make you watch in astonishment due to the sheer brilliant execution of the shot and follow up by the director almost forgiving him for the shaky graphics. Rajamouli is director who is brilliant at turning weird ideas in brilliant scenes and full marks for the sheer attempt at something India has not seen before with both the parts. \nBetter plotline would have taken it far to another level but alas. Whatever the case catch this conclusion at a theatre near you for the next epic might be a long wait. Sahoo Bahubali Sahoo.",

I also happened to watch the Tamil and Malayalam versions, and was very disappointed (because of over simplification of dialogues due to translations). The film has a great pace. Prabas, Ramya Krishnan, Satyaraj and Anushka Shetty have showcased great acting skills! Music is fantabulous, especially in Telugu. I can;t keep getting goosebumps when I hear \"Haisaaaa Rudrasaa\".

No one word will forget baahubali the word. Baahubali is a perfect example of how the movie should be made. Bollywood please learn from the tollywood kollywood.prabhas you have become my second favourite star after Rajinkanth.

Why do you clap when Jet-li or other HK stars fly in the air, walk on water and do all sorts of crazy stuff? That is well accepted as Chinese fantasy genre and understand that Bahubali is an Indian fantasy film.When you can live with Mummies coming to life and potter like spells then you can easily digest the superhero action of Bahubali as well.

Prabhas is a visual treat for his fans. The acute emotions displayed by each actor leaves the audience in awe. Hats off to SS.Rajamouli in dreaming this epic and Prabhas, Rana,Anushka, Ramya Krishna, Sathyaraj, Nasser in believing in his dream. The background music and the songs are mesmerizing.I have seen few bad reviews on this film and I don't understand where they come from or how misconceived they are. But if you love Indian drama, music, romance, war, revenge, loyalty, bravery and sets- this is the only movie for you! Anyone who watches this movie will definitely become a huge fan of Prabhas!!",

It is an epic with two parts, The Beginning and The Conclusion. Secrets in the kingdom of Mahishmati are discovered by Shivudu. He learns that his father Amrendra Bahubali was murdered by his uncle, Kattappa. But there are more secrets and truths to be told.\nThe movie overall was very entertaining, and it taught me about culture and tradition of the old times in Hindustan. When I watched the first part it made me eager to watch the second one as well. The first part ends in a climax that has the whole world buzzing for the answer. \"Why did Kattappa kill Bahubali?\" When the second part did came, I watched it and I was amazed and very entertained. The story that is told about Amrendra Bahubali is just fascinating. But it also all ties in strongly. All the characters have a significance in forwarding the movie. S.S. Rajamouli does a great job of working with a big cast and organizing them to direct this brilliant movie.\nAll the characters have fantastic method acting of their roles. In this film, everything is justified because every scene is important and has a purpose. This film is right up there as one of, if not, the best Indian ever. It competes shoulders to shoulders with Hollywood films. This creative epic is nothing more than a masterpiece.",

            "content": "The Conclusion definitely answers our question, \"Why did Kattappa kill Amerandra Baahubali?\". The plot takes some time to unfold but picks up pace after two thirds of showtime. Screenplay is above average at all times though lacking the epic feel and mysterious charm of part one. Cinematography is cleverly handled with a mix of animated sequences with real scenes. A couple of animations are awe inspiring, some are believable and others are flights of fantasy, however none of the animated scenes are charismatic. Sound is unobtrusive in not such a good way. Background songs start off at a great note but lose their fizz almost instantly. We see inspirations from Hobbit and 'I see fire'. The entire movie is coloured in earth tones and sepia. Even the night looks lit by neon lights. We squarely miss the amazing colours and fantastic Avatar like picturesque dream-reality of part one. There are violent and gory scenes as expected from an epic drama of this scale. While Anushka has done a better job at similar roles elsewhere, the only advice for Tammanna fans is to be patient, and consider both parts as one whole story before you draw conclusions. Seasoned actor Ramya Krishna in the female lead of Shivagami, gives us a stupendous performance, delivering more than a few dialogues with her eyes alone! besting herself from part one. Bhallaladeva's character is very convincing, complemented by Rana's excellent form. What Mahendra Baahubali lacks in war hero attributes like his father the original Baahubali in part one, he makes up with brute force. Do you need to watch or remember part one to enjoy part two? Probably not, because part two is tells us most of the whole story in itself. Is it a must watch? Yes, if you want to survive with an uber kool status in your peer group and social media. Seven stars for using two attempts to tell us one story. Is it a great show with memorable parts and things to discuss with friends? None of the above. Action scenes are less than superb due to lack of research into battle formations and such, mostly relying on stunts to deliver those parts. Some goofs are easy to catch even by the most novice of movie critic due to continuity going overboard. What's the probability of seeing the same faces in the front of different crowds of people over 2 decades apart? Still, worth watching once. The essence of an epic is its background score, unlike 'dheevara' from part one, the music here is mostly forgettable making this movie second best in epicness when compared to its part one.",

Literally laughed on the scene where troops are thrown from coconut tree to get inside palace. Heroes got super strength like superman, can lift tree from roots, can handle any no. of troops, arrows wont touch him when literally thousands arrows are raining. Unneeded song scenes, like schene from when Devasena walks on baahubali's shoulder to the end of the song, doesn't add anything to story, only lengthened time 5-7 minutes. WHen did son baahubali(mahendra) learn sword fighting. His father got trained from childhood so he can do but the son killing everyone who got in way with swords, no logic. Predictable, knew beforehand how climax will go after that dialogue, knew Devasena would complete her walk and by the time she return, villain would certainly be defeated and ready to be die by her, BTW very nonsensical dialogue uttered villain before dying, why was that not edited out. VFX- some were great, some like putting CGI in mix with real object - discernible. Hated editing, why add slo-mo in every action scenes.Hated too much slo-mo scenes, hated impossible action scenes, hated song scenes and scenes just before the song that only lengthened movie, hated over-drama like hero beat the villain after dramatically touching white shiva-linga with blodded hands. I would have cut out first 10 minutes, unneeded scene with mad elephant and flashbacks.Only good part that can be applaud was its core script(not the screenplay) and production design- sets were fantastic which make sense that it's most expensive movie to produce.Henceforth just another typical south-Indian action movie where hero has super-strength, super-stamina, doesn't get tired after beating any no of men, and basically anything can happen without logic.",

            "content": "Baahubali 2 : The Conclusion is a Indian Telegu Film Directed By SS Rajamouli starring Prabhas, Anushka Shetty, Rana Daggubati, Sathyaraj and Ramya Krishnan.I went in the theater with lots of expectations and excitement. The Entry Song 'Shivam' is picturized fantabulously! Rajamouli gives a highlight of the prequel in the most unexpected and brilliant way. The Entry scene of Amarendra Baahubali gives goosebumps with amazing background music. Being an morning viewer of movies, I never get to witness whistling and cheering but surprisingly, crowd goes mad on his entry. The Movie develops well with some spectacular story telling from the director and stunning visuals and very well choreographed action scene and suddenly Rajamouli throws a twist in story towards the audience which unfortunately destroys my theory of WHY KATTAPPA KILLED BAAHUBALI. The movie goes ahead strongly and finally comes the Big Budgeted Climax Fight Scene. The Last Fight is spectacular with some spectacular background music, great acting, extraordinary CGI and VFX and amazing choreography.Performances - Prabhas delivers a great performance. He reads both the characters and differentiates them amazingly. This is definitely a career changing film for him as he will gain a huge amount of fans and followers with this one, deservedly Anushka Shetty plays the strong character of Devasena with grace and precision. She manages to look beautiful, but nah! Don't mistake her to be an eye candy! She delivers a strong performance Rana Daggubati delivers a good performance and looks evil, scary and strong Sathyaraj as Kattappa is fantastic! Ramya Krishnan is superb in the role of Rajmata SivagamiMusic - Music is given by MM Kreem. Shivam is a good song with some great beats. Soja Zara is a sweet classical song which is enjoyable. Jiyo Re Baahubali is a great track to express the royal character of Amarendra Baahubali. Jay Jaykara is a great song too. Veeron ke Veera is not so greatSummary - Baahubali 2 : The Conclusion doesn't disappoint me in anyway. It is extraordinary in every aspect. From Royal Sets to Beautiful Eye Pleasing Visuals and Great Action scenes, Baahubali 2 has all the cards right! The performances from all the characters are fabulous. SS Rajamouli delivers a lot of Whistle-Cheer moments with his extraordinary story telling. Overall this movie is big, majestic and dominates all the other movies releasing this year. 9 out of 10 for this fantastic creation!!",

            "content": "Bahubali 2 tells the story after the war with Kalakeyas , Kattapa continues his narration of what led him to kill bahubali. The first half is simply a bigger budget Telugu film with conspicuous CGI . There is all the clich\u00e9d elements like the beautiful heroine , the hero in his all power and glory saving the heroine , the reveal scene(the hero reveal who he truly is , everyone around him will be just wonder- struck by the magnanimity of the person standing before them) , the sleazy comedy(Kattapa does the part of the foolish friend) and praising of the hero( the one thing which is refreshingly missing from the film is patriarchy) . All this mixed with bad CGI makes the first half of the movie . Now just before you start accusing me of comparing it with a higher budget English movies , let me get one thing straight I am not doing that. In Bahubali CGI was overused , by venturing into such romantic interludes in the first half the film uses CGI in places where it was not needed . Moreover the film Ex-Machina was created on a budget of 15 million while Bahubali is done on a budget of 2.5 billion. So budget alone is not an excuse for lazy CGI effects .The sets in this film also looks lavish , but all those had CGI written all over it, buildings without a speck of dirt or a crack and the statute of Bhalla Deva seemed too cartoon like . The first half also spends too much time on the romance of Amarendra Bahubali and Devasena . A tighter 2 hr film would have made a much more compelling watch.In the second half the films gets into the meat of the plot . There are some hair rising scenes in the 2nd half which fits an epic. The interesting thing is all these scenes were not of war or brawls. It was mostly the dialogues and dramas .The scene where Amarendra Bahubali dies was brilliantly acted ,shot and had a great background score to it . If the makers had realized this they could have gone for a more compelling drama with much more drawn out characters .But instead of that too much time is invested in unnecessary scenes which couldn't contribute much to the plot or to the character development .There is no time spent on the character development of Mahendra Bahubali and all that we get from the first part of the film is that he is virtuous , noble and a stalker .The climax fight scenes didn't leave an impact on me like the fights in the first part. All the fight scenes in this film requires a leap of faith in our logic . This is an epic and to a point a leap in logic is allowed , but in the last scenes Bahubali 2 took it to too far.Prabhas as Bahubali looked convincing for the most part , Satyaraj's jokes in the first half came as annoying but he did justice to his role in the second half . Nasser's acting was over the top(the villainous laugh ,so typical of villains for at least half a century was also used here) , the strongest performances in the film was given by Anushka as Deva Sena , Remya Krishnan as Sivagami and Rana Daggubati as Bhallal Deva.For me Anushka gave the best performance in the film, Anushka carried the role with grace and power and it was a believable portrayal of a strong independent women . Bahubali 2 will break all the collection record and will surely breach the 1000 crore ceiling and I will not be surprised if it hits 1500 crore mark. But is this the film we are presenting in a silver platter to world cinema? Does huge budget make up for the lack of a strong plot?. There is a general conception that Indian film don't garner much respect in the foreign film world due to our limitations in budget and grandiose like Bahubali could change this perception . This is far from the truth , Indian film don't garner the global appeal in par with the Iranian ,Japanese or South Korean films because we don't produce good content and good content doesn't need a huge budget. Salesman(The Oscar winner 2016 on the Foreign film category) is an Iranian film which is made with a small budget , but this film had a global appeal because we felt connected to its characters' and their stories .After all we are humans and stories with human emotions can transcend boundaries. India should develop a parallel space in our cinematic culture for the growth of Art Cinema so that we could give as much attention to movies like Lunchbox and Gangs of Wasseypur as to Bahubali. Anyway Bahubali is an ambitious leap by India Cinema (especially South Indian cinema) and with a 1000 crore movie in the pipeline , Bahubali seems to have given the courage to producers to make films in a grander scale with a view of Pan Indian audiences",

Some war scenes may have referenced from The Hercules or Troy too. Though not entirely original, I still want to praise the efforts for making these two movies one of the best films I watched in year 2017. The plot is simple and predictable but I am not skeptical about that. In fact, the dialogue and OST did so well that the sentimental moments moved my heart as the story proceed to the darker side.",

I am sick of American movies with all the same plot (end of the world etc.) and the lack of honor of most characters. This movie has it all. It has character development, great acting, awesome fight sequences, singing, romance, dancing, beautiful CGI, and more. Sure there are some things that are definitely not possible in real life but like I said I want something different. This movie makes you love the protagonists and hate the antagonists. It also doesn't just let everyone win. There is betrayal and justice. There is questions about right and wrong. There is the underlying theme that if you have to forcibly take something from someone then you probably still will not be happy once you get it.I love the cast. The actor played Bhallaladeva as such a good villain. Shivagami was awesome and so was Devasena. I wish we had more of Avanthika but still happy with what we had. Of course Baahubali was wonderful playing two characters. I would want him as king just as much as the people did. Every character mattered I thought. The outfits, weapons, scenery, and CGI animals were excellent also.If you like historical or sword battle Chinese films you will like this Indian film as well. If you are sick of the same old American Flicks then try something new and see Baahubali 1 and 2. They are long flicks but never did I wish I was doing something else.",

I enjoyed these movies tremendously, Prabhas is so beautiful as Bahubali, his vulnerability and strength draws you in. Costumes and stunts are so much fun to watch. I had few hours to kill and watched it on iPad..now I'm a little disappointed that I didn't make an effort to watch in cinema. Stop reading negative comments just watch the movies.

            "content": "I have never in my life posted a review for a movie. But something about Bahubali makes you pick up the gauntlet thrown down by the movies' detractors aka sour Bollywood fans. Bahubali is a phenomenon much more profound than a mere movie to be dissected for VFX and adherence to feminist norms. The success of the movie reflects a deep desire amongst most Indians to unapologetically appreciate the country's Hindu deep culture that provides a crucible for all other cultures.Bollywood; with its noxious combination of soft porn, meaningless plots and risk-averse heroes could not produce one movie that could stir the soul of the Indian masses and enchant people around the world from Japan to Brazil.Apart from the occasionally, perhaps accidentally made good movie, the same mind-numbing nonsense of loud jokes, garish costumes, mediocre yet megalomaniacal actors, meaningless \"item numbers\" and idiotic plots was doled out decade after decade.Bahubali is nothing short of a harbinger of the return of Indian civilization as an alternative imagination to everything that the world believes. If Bollywood has an iota of common sense, it will make an about turn from the contemporary into the ancient.It will make India's deep culture the source material for deeply absorbing mythological plots married to the latest graphics.Script writers will scour the Puranas and the Upanishads for pointers. India's history and culture, thousands of years of lived experience is its greatest strength. Bahubali showed how the operationalization of even a fraction of this marvelous syncretic culture touches the hearts and minds of the teeming masses.A new breed of filmmakers will produce movies that will seem utterly new to Indian and foreign audiences and exploit to the hilt this deep human need to live history through cinema. Alas, that will not be the lesson that will be taken by the arrogant Bollywooders. I urge Rajamouli Sir to make and release an even grander Mahabharata that shakes Indian cinema to the core, blows away the parasitic nest of incompetent directors and paves the way for its turn to history and mythology; especially India's unique and rich Vedic culture. American women are swooning over Sivagami's costumes and characters, Germans are astonished at the depth in the dialogues, Japanese women are donning Indian dresses while giggling their way into the theater. Soft power is the ability of a country to make foreigners want to mimic its culture and practices. Indian civilization needs movies like Bahubali to tap into the vast market for mythology and fantasy that is a result of a world trapped in the tyranny of the present. Sorry this is not the movie review you may have expected but I thought I should pen my 2 cents.",

The first half shows us the intense love story of Amarendra Baahubali and Devasena while the second half is mostly on why kattappa killed Baahubali and the war. The climax war is something really amazing. All the scenes are well shot and is a visual treat. And the music makes it better.Don't judge the movie, go watch it. And if you haven't seen the first part or have forgotten, watch it and then go for the second.Many questions of yours maybe unanswered in the movie, if you're really interested, buy the RISE OF SIVAGAMI.

When I started watching Bahubali after my friend recommended it to me, I thought maybe this movie will take a drift from those Gravity Defying Stunts, Present a good Story...If it was a Science Fiction Movie Like 'The Matrix', then the Gravity defying stunts made sense, since it was complete programming and You Can Do anything in Programming. Bahubali Part I & II both Fails to tell a story. Copying some material from Mahabharat and running it by adding some visual effects DOES NOT QUALIFY AS A MOVIE.

Typical blockbuster movie may have couple of such scenes, but this movie has many such scenes -1. Kattappa killing Baahubali. The last minute of that sequence is heart breaking stuff. Satyaraj soared to new heights in that scene. 2. Coronation just before the intermission 3. Bow and arrow fight involving Baahubali and Deva Sena 4. Court scene in which Baahubali beheads the culprit 5. Court scene in which Baahubali chooses Deva Sena instead of throne 6. Kumara varma's death in the hands of Bijjala Deva and BhallaThis movie has beaten Khans in Mumbai collections (by far) and Rajanikanth in Tamilnadu collections. Imagine that! A dubbed film beating all Khans in their home town. Also, no Bollywood hero can even dream of beating Rajanikanth in his home state.Now, coming to Baahubali vs Bollywood. Top Bollywood films, now a days, show old boy meets young girl stories. Aamir Khan movies are exceptions, but he too looks dated romancing girls 20 years younger to him. In Baahubali, both the hero and villain were in low 30's when they shot the films. India, which has half a billion people below the age of 25, was able to connect with these actors much better when compared to Bollywood heroes who are in to their 50's.Competition is good, hope audience get to see better movies in future.10 out of 10.",

SS Rajamouli is a great story teller and he only justifies this in this movie with what he began in the first part ! The story may be a typical one seen many a times before and seems predictable at places once too many but the way it has been shown on the larger screen keeps you engaged all over ! 171 minutes run time breezes by without notice ! I can assure you that you will leave the movie theatre satisfied !There are a few flaws (Which makes me reduce the rating ! Blame it on the length of the script or the creative challenge in depicting a scene), which stand in the way in making it a perfect conclusion. I will not elaborate on them to make this review a big spoiler and would leave it for the audience to judge for themselves, as opinions might differ.Nonetheless this should not stop you from visiting your nearest theatre to watch this visual joy ! No reasons are enough to prevent you from catching this movie which will make you marvel the effort that has gone into making this mammoth projectWatch this movie to enjoy the engaging duel between the protagonist and antagonist ! Watch this movie where the female actors make a wonderful impact with their strong and bold performances and for once do more than just dancing and romancing! Watch this movie to enjoy a thrilling VFX marvel ! Watch this movie for innovative fighting trends never seen before in an epic film !",

I enjoyed my experience in the theater. The massive sets and scale added a lot to the movie giving a great look for the locations used. The story was a bit disjointed, but needed to explain the cliff hanger left from the first film. The action sequences were over the top but fit because it is apart of the Fantasy Genre and entertaining to watch. The CGI wasn't the best, but impressive with the amount of money they had to work with. Overall it met my expectations, didn't exceed them, but matched what I was expecting to see. I think the people that hated this movie either don't like Fantasy Films in general or just want the attention they get from hating anything that is popular.

Unlike north Indian films, this Telugu film has portrayed the natural beauty of Indian culture and its people. There were no sexually explicit scene which means you can enjoy this masterpiece with your whole family without any doubt. While Bahubali has achieved a new benchmark among Indian films and to become the biggest icon at present and to, it will be interesting to watch other Indian film industries work their way up to match this magnum opus of SS Rajamouli.",

            "content": "Baahubali the Conclusion, the much awaited movie, lives up to the expectations and then some. It must have been difficult for the writers, director and actors to match up to the hype created after the super duper success of the first movie. They could've tried very hard and failed, or they could've become complacent. But, none of this happened. The writers and directors were so clear about what to depict in the movie right from the beginning that each and every scene finds a link to the first part, Baahubali the Beginning. The story is very well intertwined, as truly, it is just one huge story divided in two.The main reason for many to watch the movie was just to find out why Kattappa killed Baahubali. I went to watch the movie for the same. But, in the grander scheme of things it is such a trivial point that you don't even bother about it by then. The story is so much more than that reason. Its a tale of love, hatred, conviction, dedication, etc. The feeling of watching of film that just might depict the grandeur of ancient India with its beauty, wisdom, the talk of dharma, and the deceits is just overwhelming.All the actors have done perfect justification to their roles with Anushka Shetty really looking regal, Prabhas playing two different characters with such brilliance that you can absolutely understand the difference between the two, Sathyaraj and his amazing chemistry with Prabhas showing the bond between Baahubali and Kattappa, and Rana, as the villain, with his desperation and his greed very evident. Even if you don't know the language you can understand each and every thing going on in the movie.The cinematography of the movie is so out-of-this-world that it is overpowering. The beautiful locations, all created by vfx, so stunning, the camera angles so perfect that its like watching all of it play out right in front of your eyes. One of the best scenes in the movie is an action-cum-romantic sequence that played out so beautifully that I have to admit it is the best pieces of choreographed dance routines in a movie, ever, cause it seems just like that. The chemistry between Prabhas and Anushka is killer there, surprisingly, in an action sequence.The story can in some places be called predictable, like why Kattappa killed Baahubali was pretty easy to guess all along, but, the movie is worth a million views just for the way the story has been depicted. Everything is just perfect. I myself saw it twice in the theater cause I thought once was not enough, and have seen it about 20 times since. If you have not seen the movie then you absolutely must, or you will miss out on the best piece of cinema to ever come out of India and Bollywood.",

To put topping on the already perfect cake is the acting by its well-educated South Indian actors. The training that they have received for performing the roles is well evident in every scene. The best part of it all is Prabhas, the superstar of South Indian Cinema who is taking the world by storm. The direction by SS Rajamouli is crafted to perfection. This magnum opus deserves all the hype it is receiving and much more.",

            "content": "Baahubali 2: The Conclusion created a lot of hype thanks to mass appeal and success of 'The Beginning' and due to its excellent marketing strategy.The VFX of the film is the main attraction although much polish needed for being perfect. Yes, there are a few flaws here and there but VFX is more beautiful than the first installment and all of the Indian films . The imaginary city of Mahishmiti is now grander and elegant. A new city developed for this film looked stunning. The VFX in the action scenes could have been improved though. The SFX are also good.The character development and dialogue delivery are the other positive factors although many of the dialogues are predictable. The most impressive thing is that all the characters have got a lot of screen time (except Avantika, she hardly has any dialogue!). None of the characters seemed forced which is praiseworthy. S. S. Rajamouli has done a great job in making the audience glued to their seats. The actors also are really good.The story is not given a lot of importance and is much predictable which is not surprising if you have watched the first film. It has some strong points but got ruined by pointless comedy which serves no importance to the main plot except increasing the length of the film(2 hr 47 min). The writer has completely forgotten about Avantika's rebel group and Shiva's people. The songs are catchy and really great though I think they should have been reduced.The grand film does not have a strong climax and much of the action scene in the end are really bad compared to the first film. Some of the action scenes look hysterical. While the ending of the first film was really good, this film lacks imaginative writing(the ending).The film has a lot of flaws, but still enjoyable. It is better than Baahubali 1 : The Beginning in some things and worse in some things. It's success may encourage other filmmaker to experiment with films of this genre.TL;DR Certainly enjoyable but not up-to the hype",

Half the crowd that has seen this movie has  done so to see the \"extravagance\". Secondly, we must appreciate the  promotions. While we see the obvious success of Prabhas promoting this  movie using Tropicana, we are left to wonder whether we should have  Rajnikanth promote Heinz ketchup for his next.  This movie is rife with references (all unintentional I hope). A  chariot scene that has the technological advancement of a \"Ben Hur\"  parody from the 70's. Slow motion sequences that look like the  leftovers of the puke-worthy drama in \"300\". To round it all up, a  script that is reminiscent of the \"lion king\" trilogy (archetypal).  This movie is the bane of Indian cinema. It is deeply saddening to see  the Indian cinema industry fall so hard on its back. Maybe this movie  should be given to us, Film students, as a crash course on what not to  do when directing a movie. Despite all intents and purposes, you will  leave the theater not comprehending the general lack of the two and a  half hours you spent there.  The only thing this film reminds us of is that of the tale of \"King  Solomon and the spider\". Rajamouli is the spider, who will not give up  despite his many failures. The crowd that watches this movie and hails  him as a God, just ask yourself this. How dare you put him on a  pedestal that worships people like Orson Welles, Frank Coppola, Charles  Chaplin, and even the great Indian Guru Dutt.",

            "content": "Story wise, Bahubali2 is both prequel and sequel to the Bahubali1. The story is similar to Mahabharat. Gandhari is wiser than Drutarashtra. in our story Gandhari(Shivagami) is more powerful than Drutarshtra and she rules the Mahishmati Rajyam. in the first part we have seen that she wisely gave the crown to DhrmaRaj (AMarendra Bahubali). In the second part we will see that she makes a very unwise decision of killing, which was artificially looking reasons cooked by the writer. With out a proper pramanik, she gives the execution order. Even drutarashtra in Mahabharat didn't take this kind of blunder decision. Once Amarendra Bahubali was killed the story is left with usual revenge taking climax. The story is similar to the Lion King with two brothers and the son. There are some great episodes which makes the movie in a separate bracket. There are some very mediocre episodes which will not make much negative impact on the huge success of the movie. It can become three folds bigger commercial hit than the second best movie in India. The strength of the movie is not the VFX or the great richness. Emotions and actors performance supported by background music is the backbone of the movie. All the technical departments are at their best. Bahubali brings the confidence to the Indian film makers that they can make the movies on par with the best in the world. Bahubali as a whole may not match the best in the world. but some parts of it are definitely among the best. If Rajamouli got the time he could have made more parts better than the current version. I think in the future no producer or distributor can force him to finish the product with out his approval. He is now way ahead of any director in India. in terms of number may be he is worthful of Rs5Billions or more per movie. But he don't care about that huge money. His preference is to improve himself and make better movies. Bahubali 2 the conclusion is just the beginning of the next generation of movies that are going to be made in India. In that sense Bahubali is a huge jump made by Indian cinema.",

The action scenes were 1st grade- right there with the Matrix Reloaded and other Hollywood Biggies and sometimes even better and certainly the Best one to ever come out of India. They outdid themselves on Special effects and how cool it looked on the screen. Prabhas looked as handsome as Amrendra Bahbubali & Mahendra Bahubali and Anushka looked as charming and Pretty in Devsena as ever. The story didn't have many twists but it held deep in terms of value of Promise, family, Love, Pride & Honesty. I loved when Amrendra Bahubali tells his mom that A Promise is something to live or die by and it's protection is the biggest duty of a man and steps down as the future King.I also loved the way the film showed Women Power in DevSena in not accepting marriage proposal blindly and fighting for her pride and rights. I also got shocked by the honesty and obedience of Kattappa to the Mahishmati King and the Kingdom.The climax wasn't as good as the whole movie but it wasn't something that badly disappoint me. The fight between Bahubali and Bhalla was the highlight but it could have been taken to another level or represented as beautifully as the entire film. The other thing that bothered me was relieving of Bijjaladeva who in fact was the Master Mind of the evil of Bhalla. Very Nice and energetic music and songs- suiting the occasions beautifully. Overall certainly a film that should not be missed by Bollywood audience and anybody who loves Super Action and great Visual effects.",

But, if you have watched any decent movie till now and if you are familiar with terms like story-line, antagonist, protagonist, direction, Vfx, logic etc. Then you don't need to watch this. This movie is horrible. I am giving this movie 8/10 because people around me seem to like it. They don't care about anything.For them it is a recreation of Indian famous mythology like Mahabharata and Ramayana. But, if you are curious that why people of India are liking this movie then.Before watching this you need to presume the following things.The Protagonist is a superhero. Or say that in this universe he is the purest form of good guy. With God like powers or more precisely he is GOD. (Well because we created God in our own image in the first place.)That is all.Just go with the story and don't think for a second.Law of Physics are for Idiots. You don't need to worry about this minor stuff. What do you think the character in the movie are Breathing air.Then think again. It is all fiction. People here in India worship the Protagonist as a GOD.For example Just google Rajinikanth God.You will start to get an Idea of why this Crap is selling like a hot cake in our Country. And I think you will watch it.After all if you took your precious time to read this review till the end.( I am serious.:)",

Story is original and not based on any vedas/puranas, actors are not the typical Khans, scale is grand and VFX bang-on (better than Bahubali-1).Compared to 95% Hollywood and European epic action movies (e.g. Benhur (new), Lord of the Rings, 300, Spartacus, 300, et al). Everyone (atleast every Indian) must watch this to see the new heights Indian movies have achieved and to witness rise of pan-Earth movies that are made in India!",

The series, and especially the second part, hasthe best VFX of any Indian film, stunning cinematography and visualisation of Indian architecture, culture and lifestyle. Baahubali would be remembered for this. \nCritics have said the stunts nd cinematography is largely influenced and copied by Hollywood films, but that itself proves that this film has somewhat near Hollywood feel even for the critics (which is a big plus and milestone for Indian films).\nThe next thing they didn't like would be the portrayal of Baahubali has a perfect human, with almost every skill and the highest strength. Are the Avengers suppose to be realistic then? No. One way of logically thinking about it is that the film is rather a story being told by Kattappa to his grandson, so there is prevalance of fantasy and herioics. I didn't too like the angry-bird like climax, and the bull scene, which were totally avoidable.\nThe film has a gripping plot, a script filled with punch lines, and a multitude of heart touching and ghoosbumping scenes. The scenes have been executed amazingly by the cast, and every character has bought some real value into the film. \nIt's a must watch movie, I would say because besides every flaw, this movie deserve the respect for being a forerunner.",

I had seen the prequel in the theatre and had been waiting for this movie to come out ever since. It got delayed by a year. At first I was mad because the Baahubali: The Beginning said 2016 in the end, and the year was already going too bad. But finally it came in 2017, so I guess that makes it better.\nAnd just like Baahubali: The Beginning, this one also felt legendary. Not like a cheap sequel the way successful movies make, but an actual conclusion we had all been hoping for. The question as to why Katappa killed Baahubali was answered in the most spectacular way possible. We finally got to see how Baahubali met Devasena and why he was banished from Mahishmati. The action scenes were even better than the previous movie, and it concluded without any sequel baiting.\nI see why there are so many negative reviews over here. This movie can only be truly enjoyed in a theatre. It won't have the same impact when being watched on a TV or phone. It needs a huge audience to cheer, a perfect environment to be absorbed and the satisfaction we get after we spend a good amount of money to watch a movie.\nI am really hoping this saga has come to an end. They should not make more movies unless it is really necessary. We already have the perfect duology and having more than what we need will only ruin its image which we obviously don't wish to see. This movie deserves the same love as we give to all our ancient scriptures, because that is the vision which SS Rajamouli had while making this, and it's very much apparent when we watch this movie.",

The first half shows us the intense love story of Amarendra Baahubali and  Devasena while the second half is mostly on why kattappa killed Baahubali and the war. The climax war is something really amazing. All the scenes are well shot and is a visual treat. And the music makes it better.\n\nDon't judge the movie, go watch it. And if you haven't seen the first part or have forgotten, watch it and then go for the second.\n\nMany questions of yours maybe unanswered in the movie, if you're really interested, buy the RISE OF SIVAGAMI. For all huge fans, it's a must.\n\nOverall I would give it a 4/5",

But when the film dazzled in the theatre, the whole theatre felt like the majestic palace of Mahishmathi and I, for myself, felt like a piece of the crown, witnessing the grandeur and the joyous spectacle on the screens. Prabhas originally lifts off the screens this time, with a more solid performance as, this time, Amarendra Baahubali in the major half of the film. The characters, already fleshed out, have become more exciting. And the story, more outstanding. This film is easily Rajamouli's victory of vision. Despite a low on logic war scene which made me sorely miss the first Baahubali movie, the film lives up to the originality of the sequel, even when it doesn't equalize. This is a surely unmissable film. Go watch. ",

I do feel this movie is slightly better overall since it has more impressive visual effects and the story was more engaging overall. I do feel the movie has a bit of a rocky start but eventually picks up and stays at a good pace from that point forward. The action scenes are definitely very over the top, but they are entertaining. It's a solid follow up to this ultimately well told two-part story. I definitely think the time invested in watching both of them was worth it.",

But above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most American blockbusters.",

The whole backdrop leading to the Baahubali killing is really silly as well as predictable.\nCinematography and background score is average.\nSo is there any impressive thing about this movie?? Yes, particularly two scenes ...\none is the oath taking scene which is visually delightful and surprisingly painstaking. \nSecondly the final climactic combat between the 2 bodybuilders which was pretty decent for an action cinema...\nAll the others stunts /special effects are good for only 5 minutes.\nPerformance which demand a lot of shouting is justified by Prabhas, Rana and Ramya.\nKattapa a bit overacting drama queen and his comedy is pathetic. But still He shines in some serious situations.  Anushka looks a bit old for a princess but still manages her role with a somewhat of a decent job. The directorial vision depends extremely on deficient visual effects and sturdy characters which is a big letdown.\nOverall a nice attempt by the filmmakers to explore a historic theme but they really should pay much more attention to script writing, laws of physics, logic and many more....",

I weep for the many people who will never get to see this. It's over 3 hours long but I never felt like it was dragging or needed to move along and get to the good parts, because there were no good parts, everything was somewhere between great and perfect. The special effects weren't the best, but it never hurt my enjoyment of it, and it's amazing how much this movie can do with such a low budget compared to an American blockbuster. If you haven't seen this movie and just think it is just a silly weird foreign thing that's not for you, I beg you to reconsider, because Baahubali 2 changed my life.",

Poor Tamanaah had next to no role, i wished to see her in the action sequences, the village lady who baahubali had saved in first part had more role than Tamanaah a.k.a. Avantika.\nAll the actors however did justice to their role, be it the antagonist Rana, who made presence felt with just his expressions and body language, the Tigress Ramya krishnan, the Stalwart Sathyaraj, the Majestic Prabhas and ofcourse, the Doyenne Anushka Shetty. \nThe technical team did wonders to the film, hats off to the tech team.

A halfling from the shire is tasked with protecting the fate of the free world. Why not? And if there ever was a work of Fantasy that taxed your ability to say \"why not?\" it was this one.\n\nBaahubali 2 is a triumph of CGI over a good story. A victory of extravagance over character development. Having said that, it's not without it's merits. If taken in the context of mythology/fantasy the movie will perhaps be one of the best movies of this year (both domestically and internationally). The acting is top notch, with Ramya, Sathyaraj and Rana leading the way.\n\nThe film contains all the opulence and exaggeration that is to be expected from a South Indian movie, unfortunately it also contains the naivety that is to be expected from a mythological story. The film in my opinion fails to take the age old concepts of power, manipulation and betrayal and give us something both new and grand (it certainly succeeded in the latter)\n\nBaahubali is the story of a man who was seen as a God, but the film certainly makes you wonder if he's even mortal. His only humane quality is perhaps his complete ignorance of the dangers that surround him. A quality of the strong? or the stupid? depends on your perspective. There is no doubt that the film is entertaining, however, my only wish was that the film should have balanced the fantastical with the natural rather than with the ludicrous.",

            "content": "The wait is finally over. Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is here to answer the question the nation has been waiting to know for two long years- Kattappa ne Bahubali ko kyu mara? \n\nRelax- No spoilers here! You have to go, and watch the movie to find out, just like the rest of us did. \n\nBut when you go to watch Baahubali 2, remind yourself of few things-\n\n1. This is a sequel to Baahubali: The Beginning, so either re-watch that movie, or read the story on Wikipedia, to remind yourself of the story and characters. (If you have not seen that movie, go watch it first. Duh!) \n2. If you have seen Baahubali, you know what exactly to expect from this sequel. It is a Telugu movie (irrespective of which dubbed version you see), so the storytelling is inherently grandiosely  in nature.  So the hero's will have heroic scenes and dialogues, and the villains will have over-the-top background music with extreme close ups to show you the villainy in them. \n3. This is a $200 million ambition movie, made with the budget of not even $50 million. So the VFX will at times be with par with international cinema, and at times be extremely patchy. Forgive it for that.\n\n?So I ask you give in, and allow director S. S. Rajamouli to take you on this EPIC journey.?\n\nYes, the story is a bit been there seen that, but the screenplay is very cleverly written to still keep you entertained and hooked for good three hours. ?And that is a big win for the director and writer V Prasad. ?\n\n?The production and set design are huge, and beautiful (yes, some of it is CGI, but still a great combination). The action sequences are very well choreographed, and have been attempted at international movie level. The art design, and cinematography are breathtaking. The costumes, and make-up are on point. The soundtrack is soulful, and takes the story forward, instead of breaking the narrative. But better than the soundtrack is the background music. What fabulous work. Especially for the scene right before the interval. Outstanding stuff. ?\n\nActing wise, everyone in the ensemble cast has done a fabulous job. ?Ramya Krishnan as the ego-stricken mother, Sathyaraj as Kattappa the loyal protector looking for redemption, Nassar as the cunning father, and Rana Daggubati as the vengeful brother, have all delivered great performances. ?\n\nBut the two people who stand out tall in this movie are ?Prabhas ?plying the original Baahubali and ?Anushka Shetty? playing his love interest. If you liked Baahubali the son, you will love Baahubali the father. The son version was just a small shadow of what the father is. He is everything you expect a \"Hero\" to be. He has the swagger, flamboyance, and charisma, a \"Hero\" should have. As for ?Anushka?, she is the strong female character I wanted ?Tamannaah Bhatia ?to be in the first movie. Anushka is strong, and does not back down from her ideals and beliefs, no matter who is on the other side. That's kickass. Bollywood is gonna go ga-ga over these two. \n\nBut yes, the movie is not perfect. It has its flaws. There are some continuity faults that I caught. The narrative sometimes becomes a bit self indulgent and looses focus. The climax is not as epic as I expected it to be. And like I said above, the VFX is not perfect. Also, some of the extras insisted on hamming their scenes. But despite these flaws, Baahubali is a huge achievement. It's not just entertaining, it's also one of the most technically sound movie to come out of India. And just for that, you should go watch, enjoy, and support this magnanimously ambitious project.",

            "content": "If Indian cinema has a Hall of Fame, Baahubali 2 will be one of the all-time-greatest movies & will occupy the throne for a very long time to come. OMG, I have never watched a movie with so much awe for almost every scene. CGI, sets and reality have blended so well to create visual splendor at never seen before levels, that you forget yourself and become part of the movie. There is no more comparison with Hollywood for standards/quality of movie making. Indian cinema has truly ARRIVED at the world level, setting new standards for movie making.\n\nThat was about the experience of watching the movie and the quality of movie making itself. Coming to the story/script:\n\nFor me, \"Why Kattappa killed Baahubali\" was not a big question at all - knowing Kattappa's love for Baahubali & the fact that he was a slave to the throne, either Bhallala deva or Sivagami should have ordered him was obvious.\n\nBaahubali stands tall(not just physically), but also by the measure of his character. He makes some good choices when faced with a dilemma of blind obedience to throne/mother or Dharma(even though it meant he picked his wife/lover and not mother). It is sad that he never could sit on the throne in spite of being people's choice. Prabhas has become synonymous with Baahubali with his utterly flawless all-around performance. He does it all - mind boggling stunts, romance, dance, comedy and sentimental scenes. Looking like a King should have been so effortless for him - he wears it so naturally.\n\nIf there is one character that can surpass/equal Baahubali, it is the warrior Princess Devasena. Be it the fight sequences, stoic endurance of 25 years of torture, romance, dialogue delivery - Anushka is an actress par excellence. She comes across as the personification of majestic beauty, strength and fierce independence. Her screen presence is a force to reckon with.\nNo other actress could have matched Prabhas - if Prabhas looks like a born King, she is a born Queen. Her characterization is by far THE BEST - the way she stands up to Sivagami - when Sivagami sends gold to get her hand in marriage for Bhallaladeva, her retort to Baahubali during her baby shower, the way she defends herself in the court for chopping off fingers of a Mahishmathi commander - simply WOW!\n\nRana has aced as Bhallala Deva. The gaunt face, void of any fat combined with a 6 pack body, gives a natural meanness to his face. He easily takes it up a notch with an ice cold look here or a devious smirk there. Be it the sly smiles that hide his hunger for the throne, the expressions of rage that make him hack the dead Baahubali's body, he knows where to hold back and where to go out and bare it all. He really manages to send a shiver down one's spine in terror and that is a huge victory.\n\nThe phrase \"one and only\" fits Ramya Krishnan perfectly. Her majestic screen presence in spite of being short, the combination of royal exuberance and dominance in her face, the eyes that can express compassion one second and fury the next - OMG, she gave me goosebumps so many times. Especially in the opening scene where she walks with a pot of fire on her head unperturbed by an approaching mad elephant. She should give classes on how to walk like THAT(hell or high water, I do what I do).\n\nSathyaraj as Kattappa and Nasser as Pingala Deva have played their roles very beautifully. There are no big surprises in their characters.\n\nTamannah is largely absent in part 2, save one or 2 scenes where she tries to show some grit and effort to fight, but goes unnoticed.\n\nW.r.t. script, I felt that a lot of time was spent on the flashback and there was a sense of hurry when it came to the present where Shivu had to avenge his father's death. Jumping into\na war with mighty Mahishmathi without any strategy did not sound wise. I expected that Kattappa will seek the help of Aslam Khan(Kicha Sudeep) or Baahubali's allies and advise Shivu about any weaknesses of Bhallaladeva or secrets of the Mahishmathi fort. The romance track in part 1 could have been replaced with some more story from part 2 & a couple of scenes that show brainstorming for the final war would have given it a sense of completeness.\n\nThe letdown for me in this movie is the character of Sivagami. The one who was the epitome of justice and fairness in part 1,falling prey to hearsay and giving/changing orders at the fall of a hat - she looks like a gullible person with a frail ego who has no regard for due diligence when it comes to matters of the state. If not for her saving the life of Mahendra Baahubali, she could very well be seen as a villain in part 2. May be \"vinaasha kaale, vipareedha buddhi\" is true in her case. When the time is bad, you make cloudy judgements and act in haste.\n\nI can nitpick on the script a little bit, but nothing, I mean nothing will take away from the magnum opus this movie truly is. I am SO, SO, SO PROUD to be hailing from the region where this movie was made and speaking the same language as them.\n\nMusic - BGM is great and the songs sound great in Telugu, not that good in Tamil. I don't know if it is because I heard them in Telugu first, but so much is lost in translation. I had the\nsame feeling about part 1 songs. Somehow, Madhan Kaarky's lyric engineering does not sit well with me.\n\nSabu Cyril(Production Designer) and Rama Rajamouli and Prashanti (costume designers) need a special mention for their fabulous work. One cannot wrap one's head around the sheer amount of work, a production of this magnitude would have warranted. Hats off to the entire team, especially Rajamouli and his vision!",

And when I say request, I mean really, a lot. I had seen the prequel in the theatre and had been waiting for this movie to come out ever since. It got delayed by a year. At first I was mad because the Baahubali: The Beginning said 2016 in the end, and the year was already going too bad. But finally it came in 2017, so I guess that makes it better.And just like Baahubali: The Beginning, this one also felt legendary. Not like a cheap sequel the way successful movies make, but an actual conclusion we had all been hoping for. The question as to why Katappa killed Baahubali was answered in the most spectacular way possible. We finally got to see how Baahubali met Devasena and why he was banished from Mahishmati. The action scenes were even better than the previous movie, and it concluded without any sequel baiting.I see why there are so many negative reviews over here. This movie can only be truly enjoyed in a theatre. It won't have the same impact when being watched on a TV or phone. It needs a huge audience to cheer, a perfect environment to be absorbed and the satisfaction we get after we spend a good amount of money to watch a movie.I am really hoping this saga has come to an end. They should not make more movies unless it is really necessary. We already have the perfect duology and having more than what we need will only ruin its image which we obviously don't wish to see. This movie deserves the same love as we give to all our ancient scriptures, because that is the vision which SS Rajamouli had while making this, and it's very much apparent when we watch this movie.",

Fantastic direction, Rana, Anushka , Tammanah and everybody did their best... but one disappointment that is Prabhas' acting.. I can easily give full marks but can't because:- Tbh,Prabhas must be more accurate enough (that's why he didn't get any award for film) .. Prabhas has no clarity in his speech while saying dialogue.. Improvement requires for Prabhas over here.. No promising acting level.. I also noticed in Bahubali 1 also.. Also except Prabhas, everything was nicely done.. jai SSR !!",
