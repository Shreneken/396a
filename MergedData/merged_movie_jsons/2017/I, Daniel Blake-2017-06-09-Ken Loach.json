            "content": "Many other reviewers have already spoken eloquently and in detail, in praise of this deeply moving, superlative film. I'd just like to offer an observation from a somewhat different angle. What struck me about 'I, Daniel Blake' was an aspect of subaltern powerlessness that pundits often overlook, i.e., that the poor and marginalized are almost never in control of their own time. In the USA dentists, doctors, therapists, lawyers, and all sorts of professionals get to maximize and monetize their time to the nth degree. As for govt. agencies like the DMV or employment or benefits offices--they are often (under-)staffed by bureaucrats who are in no hurry to accommodate John Q. Public. Patients/clients/supplicants wait (and wait and wait) in their spot on the usually stalled conveyor belt to get their allotted modicum of perfunctory attention. After all, they're just cogs in the revenue stream and THEIR time is deemed unimportant. Same thing with phone access to govt. agencies, bureaucracies, insurance companies, you name it. These corporate entities have complex and often confusing \"phone trees,\" long wait times on hold (during which horrendous music plays), and customers reps who are often either obtuse, indifferent, mean-spirited, or confused themselves. For the poor seeking any sort of public assistance these nuisances and indignities are multiplied tenfold because--as 'I, Daniel Blake' dramatizes--the System doesn't really want to serve the so-called \"disadvantaged\"; it wants poor folk in need to get discouraged and go away (and hopefully die and decrease the surplus population).",

            "content": "Ken Loach does it again.If you know Ken Loach (and importantly his writing partner Paul Laverty) you'll know I, Daniel Blake.It's a nightmare. A total nightmare. Life on poverty line Britain that is. And Loach hammers this home with gusto. He chooses Newcastle as his latest political landscape, partly because \"it's grim up North\" but also because, in my experience, Geordies are the salt of the earth; kind, lovable folks. And this is the main emotional driver of this nightmare. Daniel Blake is caught in a trap. A bureaucratic hell populated by \"computer says no\" mini Hitlers occupying mainly minor roles in the Jobseeker hell that is Tory Britain. In a bid to out 'scroungers' the system has eaten itself and is spitting out vulnerable pitiful fodder like Daniel (played deeply sympathetically by comedian Dave Johns. He'll never win an Oscar but this part was made for him) and the lovable but deeply vulnerable Katie (played equally well by Hayley Squires - Call the Midwife).He's had a heart attack and his doctors say he can't work but the Benefits Police say he has to go on jobseeker allowance and look for work or lose all entitlement to any money AT ALL.It's farcical.She's moved from a women's hostel in London because she can't afford a flat in London with her two children (one slightly miscast as a rather posh daughter, Daisy). She's having the same problems, only hers start from a tinpot Hitler chucking her out of the Job Centre for being late for her appointment.They bond. He helps her. She helps him. It's grim but deeply affecting. We then follow their shared struggle.In many ways this movie is like a Ken Loach Primer. It has all his usual trademarks and the 'working class people are good' message is laid on way too thickly.But.And it's a big but they are in a profoundly believable real-life drama and I found myself in tears (of collective shame?) three times during it.It certainly makes the reality of food banks in Britain very, very meaningful. I won't pass a collection point again if my conscience holds up.Everything that is good about Loach is in this film. In parts it's laugh out loud funny (but it's laughs of derision at our State). In parts it's deeply moving, even though some of the plot is verging on the ridiculous.But who cares. Ken Loach holds a mirror up to our frankly DISGUSTING society and mocks it.But he mocks it with the most vicious of venom. It feels real. Really real.It's a must see.",

            "content": "We all hate it when we are treated according to a standardised procedure, with no discretion shown for our particular circumstances. Perhaps it's inevitable that a benefits system is impersonal; but perhaps it's rather a feature by design, to strip applicants of their dignity, either to deter scroungers or simply to drive down the bill by making it humiliating, and difficult, to get what you really need. In the U.K., it has for a long time been widely suspected that some people claim invalidity benefits when actually fit to work; but attempts to prevent this have led to cries of outrage that the sick are sometimes basically left to fend for themselves, forced to seek jobs they are not fit to take. Ken Loach's film 'I, Daniel Blake', is fictional, but it's grounded in many credible accounts of how the system works.The film itself is minimalistic, without any soundtrack; it's low key, showing us the everyday reality of Daniel's life. But it makes one angry watching it, because one can easily believe that for many people, this is exactly how the system presents itself. You couldn't call the film fun to watch, but it's important: every time you hear politicians lambast scroungers, you need to consider what the counter measures mean for those without a support network. Sadly, this is a must see movie.",

            "review_title": "The best film I have seen this year.",
            "content": "After seeing \"I, Daniel Blake\" there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Ken Loach isn't just the best director to have come out of Britain in the last 50 years but one of only a small handful of great directors still working today. Of course, his films are not merely 'entertainments'; he is the most unashamedly political director there is and \"I, Daniel Blake\" is his most unashamedly political film, certainly since \"Cathy Come Home\". It is also possibly his best.Once again the writer is Paul Laverty who was worked with Loach numerous times in the past, (theirs is the among the greatest of all cinematic partnerships), and his superb script cuts to the bone. As someone who has sat on both sides of a Benefits Office counter I can honestly say that no-one strikes a false note here. Loach is famous for working with non-professionals or largely unknown actors, (Carol White, a fresh face when she made \"Cathy Come Home\", David Bradley in \"Kes\", Crissy Rock in \"Ladybird Ladybird\"), and \"I, Daniel Blake\" is no different.The title character is played by stand-up comic Dave Johns and the young, single mother he befriends is Haley Squires. Add in an extraordinary cast of British character players and you have a film that oozes a documentary-like realism from every pore. Of course, at times it is virtually unwatchable. This is a film about victims and the appalling bureaucracy that sees them slip through the net. You could say it is a film about the failure of the Welfare State. Unlike \"Cathy Come Home\" however, I can't see it touching the hearts and minds of our present Tory Government which surely is shameful. Brexit, we have been told, is about taking back control but control of what; an appallingly defunct system where to care or show feeling is almost a sackable offence? The film was rightly applauded at the screening I attended and is the best I have seen this year.",

            "review_title": "Unapologetically Political, Openly Moral",
            "content": "After Ken Loach's latest film \"I, Daniel Blake\" (2016) took home the most prestigious film award of the year, Palme d'Or at Cannes earlier this summer, there has been a lot of discussion or at least anticipation of discussion on the film. The Guardian, for one, published a long article where people from all walks of life shared their differing opinions on the film. As a fierce story of social relevance, telling about an ailing carpenter whose life goes to pieces in the vast sea of bureaucracy, \"I, Daniel Blake\" is bound to be criticized for being didactic and demagogic as it hits the commercial screens. Some will fall in love with the film for its honest authenticity, while others will be put off by its unapologetic directness. The film begins with the title character, Daniel Blake going through an assessment in the unemployment office after his doctor has deemed him unfit for work due to a heart condition. Unfortunately, Daniel ends up in a paradoxical position, the likes which Kafka could have devised, where he is not concerned unhealthy enough to apply for sickness benefit and has to therefore apply for job seeker's allowance, coercing him into a pointless cycle of searching for jobs he cannot really take. In the middle of this absurd jungle of gray offices and red tapes, Daniel befriends Katie, a single mother of two in a similar situation. Daniel's cardinal sin in the bureaucratic world is his refusal to play by its rules, to fake and to pull the strings where needed. Loach is known for his simplicity in both style and narrative without ever coming close to minimalism. His simplicity is of a different kind, a simplicity of the heart on the level of the subject matter which is often social by nature. This simplicity gives room for the unfolding of story and character in their natural state which is of the utmost importance for Loach's intentions. At times warm and funny, at others raw and brutal, the story of \"I, Daniel Blake\" is hard to be dismissed for its authenticity. It will likely speak to most people as do the great realist novels of the 19th century. It is a simple voice with real thought and emotion behind it, saying something of relevance, straight out and loud. While the title of the film might pave way for quasi-libertarian interpretations of Loach's critique of the social benefits system, his intentions could not be clearer to those who have seen the film. The titular character is merely someone to carry the torch of solidarity; to Loach and others, he represents a mass of millions. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote that the film \"intervenes in the messy, ugly world of poverty with the secular intention of making us see that it really is happening, and in a prosperous nation.\" This is the simplicity which gives Loach's cinema its moral aura.Although many may feel put off by the film's direct social message and strong moral pathos, which can feel didactic or even demagogic at times, and it will not find its dearest fan in yours truly either, I think the film deserves acclaim for its integrity. The film does not hide its rhetoric or its message. After all, its \"leftist agitation\" may not be stranger than the ideology of upper middle class family life propagated by contemporary popular culture. The way I see it, \"I, Daniel Blake\" is more a personal expression of worry and concern rather than manufactured propaganda with an impersonal agenda. At worst the film might be preachy or sentimental, but at best it is the most authentic thing Ken Loach has done since \"My Name Is Joe\" (1998), a parallel work in the truest sense of the word. To put it bluntly, I am glad that \"Jimmy's Hall\" (2014) did not end up being the legacy Loach left for cinema; but \"I, Daniel Blake\" could very well be just that.",

            "content": "This movie caught me by my heart, like every other piece by Laverty- Loach cooperation. It is not a thriller, there are no twists, no peaks of emotions. It shows the naked reality of our everyday lives with its great pains and humor at the same time. But, the \"banality\" of these great pains is the strength of the movie, it shows how every encounter with the system is the time we face the reality of the system and look for someone who will give a hand us to survive it. Of course, this is mostly valid for the working class. The film softly depicts that it is not a socialist propaganda, because when truly shown the reality itself unveils as a socialist propaganda. But the film is not another documentaristic presentation of the everyday life of a worker, as it also shows how to cope with all these we experience. It is the formation of a solidarity with others like us, the woman in the queue, the Chinese in the factory, the black in the warehouse, the clerk at the office... We are already connected, even with those in other continents. Once we see someone shouting with his writing on the wall, we should shout with him with our voice. If one of them writes a letter, another should spread its word.A shot in the head of the Britain's social security system, a great call for solidarity.",

            "content": "If film is a mirror on society then the sheer volume of recent movies  about the ugliness of the post- GFC world is a reflection of the scale  of devastation it has caused. Most are essays in poverty that explore  the loss of humanity for ordinary people. The film I, Daniel Blake  (2016) is another in this genre. It is an intense portrait of an  ordinary man who struggles to retain dignity in an Orwellian world. Far  from entertaining, it is gritty, raw, and unrelenting.  Daniel Blake (Dave Johns) is a rough-speaking but likable 59-year-old  tradesman in Newcastle, England. He is recovering from a serious heart  attack and lives alone. Unable to work, he does what thousands like him  do in such circumstances: he applies for support allowance so he can  pay his bills until health returns. What happens next is not the point,  rather it is how it happens that will make you cringe. Form-filling  becomes an obstacle course for preventing people like Daniel from  getting help and the staff who process him absolve themselves of  responsibility through constant referral to the \"decision-maker\" who is  never there. Denied support allowance, he must apply for a job-seeker  benefit that requires 35 hours a week of documented job hunting. His  protestations are officially sanctioned and he loses all support.  In the midst of his own inhuman treatment by a soul-less bureaucracy  Daniel tries to help a single mother with two young children who is  also crushed by the system. Katie (Hayley Squires) has moved from a  homeless hostel and is living on food handouts because her benefits  have been stopped. She finds 'affordable accommodation' that Daniel  offers to repair and he becomes a father figure. Still unable to buy  shoes for her children, Katie finds the kind of work that shocks Daniel  but is the last resort for many abandoned by a social welfare system  with gaping holes in its safety net. Desperate to help her, Daniel  vents his frustration through graffiti on the welfare office wall and  briefly becomes an urban hero.  This is a disturbing film that many audiences will find confronting,  particularly those who think they live in a caring society that  supports people in need. The pace is slow and the dialogue often terse,  but that's how life is at the bottom. The subdued cinematography and  colour palette accentuates the drabness of life for the dispossessed.  Perfectly cast, the two main actors fill their roles with an authentic  voice for countless ordinary people who fall on hard times. There is no  joy in this film and whatever humour you find is there to make the  story bearable. But in a world that moves inexorably towards a  hard-right social conscience, it is a film that cries out to be seen  and heard.",

            "content": "Honestly, I'm too upset and exhausted after watching that to write a substantial review. As someone who's been put through this system and is waiting under the sword of Damocles to go through it again, this was a hard bloody watch. But I knew it was important so I made myself watch it. I was actually surprised how well they captured the process. So much resonated. It's very hard to put into words when you're going through it but there's this ubiquitous enmity from start to finish, regardless of the legitimacy of your claim, regardless of your circumstances. It's nothing less than psychological warfare aimed squarely at the working classes and the disabled who cannot win in this situation. I particularly like how they captured the disgusting Catch 22 aspect of this rigged process. Whereby all legitimate claims are cynically refused by default. Then they automatically switch you to jobseeker's allowance from which point they set the rottweilers on you to bully you into paid or unpaid work by a process of harassment and public humiliation. It's easily the most sinister process I've ever experienced. I was shocked and horrified by it. There have been many stories in the press about people who are patently unfit for work who have been deemed fit for work by these criminals. And they inevitably end up killing themselves. The UK took a sinister run when Thatcher took power. The country has never been the same since. It is no less than warfare on the working classes, the poor, the disabled, and the sick. It's about time we drove these crooked traitors out of their comfortable leather chairs in Westminster and gave them a taste of their own medicine. It's gone too far. Anyway that's more than I wanted to say. I can't fault the film. It crammed a lot in there to illustrate the problem start to finish and I salute Ken Loach for this very important piece of work. Great acting and cinematography. A special nod to the people who played the bad guys. That is hard to pull off. It sent shivers down my spine they did such a good job. Thank you Ken Loach.",

            "content": "'I, Daniel Blake' was highly recommended to me by a close relative, she having found it very insightful and moving if very on the nose. Actually watched it a few weeks ago with family, it has just taken me a while to get round to reviewing it with so much to see and review, with such a long watch and review list that keeps getting longer, and also a lot going on in my life.Am truly thankful for the recommendation, as it was the above (insightful and moving as well as honest, parts hitting hard and home with me) on all counts. 'I, Daniel Blake' to me, and many others, was a very good film, nearly great as a matter of fact. It may not be for all tastes, like Ken Loach himself, and it is understandable why its depiction of the Jobcentre system especially was controversial. Is it perfect? No, of course not. Are there many good things? Absolutely. Are they big? Yes, very.There is no doubt that 'I, Daniel Blake' is a hard-hitting film. It certainly hit me hard and some of it hit home with me, having been there with a couple of the situations myself. It is admittedly not a subtle film, it is very on the nose and there are times where it does go too far. The Jobcentre/social worker people could have been painted in a more sympathetic and less exaggerated light seeing as it is the system that's heavily flawed (was in the situation once, and it was not a happy experience, actually incredibly stressful, at all) not them. It was the latter that was clearly intended, it just felt a little heavy handed.For me, the ending was also somewhat abrupt and almost like a cheat, like they were trying to shy away from ending the film on too pat a note, and it was a situation that one does sort of foresee but doesn't want to happen. Katie's final scene is certainly poignant, but somehow the ending didn't wholly satisfy.However, 'I, Daniel Blake' is visually slick and suitably gritty, to match the seriousness of what's being depicted. The music is wisely not constant and is quite understated, George Fenton can be the stirring and sweeping, as well as hauntingly beautiful, sort of composer so it was nice to hear something different.On top of that, 'I, Daniel Blake' is thoughtfully and honestly scripted, with a few gently humorous touches, constant realism and parts that resonate emotionally, found myself agreeing often with what Daniel says. The story raises many issues, important and relevant but also difficult ones, how it depicts them is as said not always subtle and very on the nose but it's done in a way that is realistic, makes one think hard after it's over, it's insightful, is admirably fearless in its approach and makes one identify completely with Daniel and Katie. There is emotional impact here, like at the food bank and Katie's final scene. They are very much compellingly real and instantly rootable and one wants them to succeed and overcome their adversity, their relationship is very touching and charming.Loach directs with confidence and experience and he gets terrific lead performances from Dave Johns and Hayley Squires. Johns is in a more dramatic role and gives intensity and emotional power to it, fully succeeding in making Daniel relatable. Squires very movingly portrays a struggling single mother, in a way that any single parents with struggles will find themselves in.Overall, very good. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

The acting removes any barrier between players and audience, we all felt in the scene, we all felt we were part of their background.

Loach manages to multiply the grim Northern ethos by never filming on a sunny day, guaranteeing grey skies throughout the movie.

Oh Kes!\" But Kes was 47 years ago and shamefully, I'm not familiar with any of his films since then. One conclusion from this realisation is that Loach has a strong reputation as a filmmaker and this was my long awaited reunion. We follow Daniel Blake, a middle-aged carpenter who's taken a few recent knocks, one of which is suffering a heart-attack and deemed not able to return to work. It's a position no one would want to be in, forced to sacrifice your own health or lose everything you have worked so hard for. We witness the hurdles that seem purposely put there to hinder payments, speaking from personal experience I can relate to this situation to a degree. How are people such as Daniel Blake suppose to survive, or better still, have a good life they are suppose to be able to live. It's a harsh reality on how parts of the British system fails it's people and proof that there's no real incentive to do things by the book. Having been in a similar situation myself, skirting the unemployment line getting advise from people who have no ambitious or understanding of what I wanted to do. Taking this on a more personal level, I quit a stressful position last year in the hopes of pursuing my own dream of being an artist and writer. Having to sign agreement that I would spend a number of hours trying to find work and having to provide evidence of doing so each fortnight would grant me the universal credit that I never actually received. I actually had a good case worker, as everyplace of work has good people, but equally there are those that can't see beyond, much like what is portrayed in this story. Though, instead of supporting me in trying to be something I both enjoy and apparently good at, they attempted to find me similar stressful jobs that I left for my own sanity, wanting to place me back amongst the wolves. Dave Johns is exceptional as Daniel Blake, emitting the boiling frustrations of the soul- destroying turn of events, right to the very end. Hayley Squires' Katie is short of brilliant too, displaying the tremendous pressure when faced with these kind of tribulations. Though, the acting from the rest of the supporting cast is less desirable, it's forgivable. It's a raw, honest and emotional look at the suffering and poor way of life some unfortunate people have to contend with in Great Britain. It's compelling, invoking and upsetting, showing the great lengths and risks people go through in order to maintain their self dignity. It's certainly a film that boasts Loach's credibility.

            "content": "British director Ken Loach isn't known for politically subtle films; his stories are ones which grounded in one political worldview, promoting and expounding it from a variety of angels. That's not to say he's necessarily heavy-handed; but he runs that risk on occasions. Approaching this film, aware that it was his state of the (British) nation address from the point of view of people lost in a labyrinthine benefits system, I was expecting something I would be naturally sympathetic to but possibly alienated from due to what I expected to be broad-brush strokes. I was wrong; it's Loach's most nuanced and delicate film, telling a simple story with slowly simmering rage. A widowed man is signed off sick from work due to a heart condition; as he attempts to claim the benefits he needs he befriends a single mother and her children as they too seek the support the state should be giving them. Though the script is compelling, the real strength of the film is in its silences and counterpoints; the personal care of the food bank volunteers against the largely dispassionate, impersonal government employees. This results in the films most moving scene - a visit to a food bank where a combination of hunger and receiving compassion tip a desperate, nearly crushed woman in to an act of quiet desperation that's heartbreaking to watch. It's to the film's immense credit that it doesn't drift into anti-climax afterwards; yet neither is there a cheap, easy victory or moment of false hope. Hope is there, but it walks a vulnerable line of being extinguished by the system designed to serve the very people lost under the weight rules and regulations. It's a story of the people who fall through the cracks; it reminded me of Dickens' urgent, prophetic tales of urban poverty and never ending legal wranglings - and the film does not suffer from such lofty comparison. We're left asking: do we contribute to such systems' oppression and suffering, or do we seek out those who are lost, sit with them, listen to them, walk with them? It's a film of difficult questions and few answers; but that is moving, satisfying, funny and eloquent for all that.",

            "content": "A blistering and emotional incident of faceless bureaucracy is made by veteran British film maker Ken Loach in his superb new movie, I, Daniel Blake, which deservedly won the Palme d'Or at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.The central character, Daniel Blake, suffered a heart attack at work. Until he is fully recovered he has been strongly advised by his surgeon, GP and physio that he should not attempt to seek gainful employment. After being forced to answer a series of irrelevant questions, a health specialist from one of the companies the government has outsourced its welfare education tests to, notifies Daniel that he is fit for work. Thus, like so many other people, he finds himself caught up in a system of complaints and appeals, waiting for something to change.At first Daniel's good humour carries him through. He may initially appear to be a loner, but when he meets single mother Katie and her two children, his warmth and compassion shines through. For a time his own predicament takes a backseat as he fights for her rights \u2013 the scene in a local food bank is heartbreaking as we see how much Kate has sacrificed for her children. But Daniel's case seems to be going nowhere and exasperation with the system finally pushes him to express his exasperation publicly.This is a deeply humane and all-two relevant movie from the 80-year- old Loach and probably his best film since Cathy Come Home, aided of course by a gritty, unsentimental script by his regular collaborator Paul Lavery. Made in the manner of a dramatised documentary, it is angry at a system that demeans people, but has enough compassion for some of the people employed by it whose desire to help those in need is hindered by callous administrators.Of course the film wouldn't have the impact it has without two excellent central performances. Dave Johns, previously known as a stand-up comedian, skillfully balances Daniel's Veneer of gruffness with whip-smart humour, while newcomer Hayley Squires is very moving as Kate.This undoubtedly is the best British Film of last year and shows all too vividly that no one should be treated as a statistic.",

            "content": "\"I, Daniel Blake\" (2016 release; 100 min.) brings the story of the title character. As the movie opens, a recent widower living in Newcastle, is being interviewed to assess whether he is healthy enough to work (Dan suffers from a heart condition). \"When can I get back to work?\" he keeps asking. As it happens he isn't cleared to work, yet he also is ineligible to unemployment benefits. Along the way, Dan gets to know a young single mother with two kids, who are in sheer desperate conditions. At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from veteran British director Ken Loach, now a crisp 81 years young. \"I, Daniel Blake\" continues his long string of 'social commentary' movies. Here he sheds a light on the British welfare system, and let's just say that it's an unfavorable and uncomfortable light. The absurdities become apparent very quickly. This film caused an uproar in the UK, where a debate raged as to how accurate the film portrays the welfare system. I honestly have no idea, but I can tell you that the movie works very well AS A MOVIE, and it packs a thunderous emotional and social wallop. There are certain scenes you feel both outraged and gutted at the same time. Dave Johns is excellent in the title role, but even better is Hayley Squires as the single mother Katie. She will absolutely floor you. \"I, Daniel Blake\" premiered at the 2016 Cannes festival to immediate acclaim (it won the Palm d'Or), and it has accumulated a bunch of trophies, including Best Film at this year's British equivalent of the Oscars. (In sharp contrast, is was COMPLETELY overlooked by the Oscars...) I don't know why it's taken so long for this movie to get a theater release in the US, but it finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly, to my surprise and dismay. \"I, Daniel Blake\" is one of the best films I have seen so far this year (and I see a lot of them), and I strongly encourage you to see this out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",

            "content": "A decade after his \"The wind that shakes the barley\", Ken Loach collected his second Palme d'Or award with \"I, Daniel Blake\". The general entertainment-seeking audience (who are used to rain-of-bullets, jaw-cracking-punches and explosion every three minutes), if they are ever enticed for whatever insane reason to buy a ticket to see this movie, may have a common question: who is the villain? An answer is actually provided near the end of the movie: the state. This movie is a bitter accusation against the heartless bureaucratic system.The titular protagonist is 59, recently widowed, a carpenter by profession. His vicissitudes are only just beginning. While not noticeable on the surface, he is a patient recovering from heart attack. With the British social security system as a safety net, you would have thought that Blake is spared the agony of being driven to abject poverty, and even the threat of starvation looming in the not-too-distant future. Unfortunately, while there are several social security systems that might help him, he hits one road block after another, banging his head against the rigidity innate in these systems and officials that appear to relate more closely to robots than human beings. As the future looks bleak (he is selling one possession after another to stave off going to food banks that will rob him of his last scrap of dignity), a ray of hope appears. There is a good very chance that he can win an appeal against one of the \"sanctions\" that blocks relief money to which he is entitled. But, trying to freshen himself up in the washroom before the hearing, he dies of a sudden heart attack.A subplot running parallel with Blake's fight against the bureaucracy is his friendship with a young woman, entirely Platonic. Katie has two young children, a girl and a boy, from two failed liaisons (not sure if they were marriages). Without a professional skill as Blake's (albeit working-class skill), she is financially even worse off, to the extent of going hungry because the provision from the food back is only enough to feed the children. Motivated by sympathy for a kindred human spirit, he becomes sort of a surrogate father figure of the family. Meanwhile Katie, with the meaning of \"dignity\" taking up more of a monetary bias, resorts to prostitution. When Blake discovers this, the relationship between them understandably suffers. When it is eventually mended, he is close to his last days.Before watching the movie, upon learning that a stand-up comedian has been cast for the title role, I was a little surprised as most people would be. I am now fully convinced that Dave Johns is an excellent choice. If the posters have you believe that Blake is simply a manifestation of anger, it is misleading, intentional or not. The underdog that Johns portrays is indeed frustrated sometimes even exasperated. But he is patient, sometimes almost to the extent of stoic resignation. That is what makes him so endearing to the audience, plus of course his kindness to Katie and her children.\"I, Daniel Blake\" stays well clear of sentimentality and is only a tad melodramatic at one or two places (such as the discovery of Katie getting into prostitution and the Blake's final death). Nor is this movie judgmental on a personal sense. An array of people paraded on the screen are depicted realistically. For example, when Katie is caught at shoplifting, the tough looking security in-charge turns out to be surprisingly humane and lenient, while the mild-looking store clerk has ultra-motives in the kindness he shows her. Likewise, the good and the bad equally populate the individuals Blake runs into, with none of them depicts with any exaggeration.Dave Johns is a lovingly understated Daniel Blake that will have you weeping silent tears rather that breaking down in an emotional outburst. Hayley Squires, portraying Katie in stubbornly self-contained agony and muted defiance, matches Johns scene for scene in excellence. Briana Shann as the little daughter Daisy shines.",

The settings have a sense of real places. The plot and the turns are forseeable. For example, after Ivan gives Katie his number, the rest is a given but the emotion is never diminished.

            "content": "\"I, Daniel Blake\" is a British English-language film from 2016, this year, that runs for approximately 100 minutes, so slightly over 1.5 hours. The director is BAFTA nominee Ken Loach and the script comes from experienced writer Paul Laverty. The title says that this is the story of Daniel Blake, but this is only partially true. This is at least as much the story of Katie, a young mother of two who just moved to Newcastle. The actor who plays the title character is Dave Johns and this is certainly surprising as this is a high-profile role in a fairly big movie, a pretty prestigious project. Johns has not acted for 6 years in film and he was almost completely unknown before these years as well. Maybe he is a successful theater actor? I don't know. But I do know that he played his part here pretty well and same can also be said about Hayley Squires who plays the female protagonist.This is a really depressing movie to be honest. It deals with the story of a man who struggles with his professional life after a heart attack and we get to watch all these official bodies and their bureaucracy in dealing with him. It's a truly sad state of affairs. The perfect example here is how he gets punished so hard for every mistake he makes, but when they send the letter to him before calling, nobody punished them. And all their absurdities. As for the woman, she has to deal with the difficult task of bringing up two children. Without a man and without money. And of course, she gets punished hard by the unemployment office as well for a minor error she made that wasn't even her fault. There is truly nothing happy about this film, especially not the ending. For one of them, it ends in tragedy, the other has to work in a truly horrible profession and we find out that results in the character's general sadness.But maybe all this misery makes it a good watch. It is pretty brave and bold in my opinion and not scared of talking about issues that are not seen as such issues by many. The bureaucratic contents in this film were truly unbelievable. And it is so horrible to watch innocent good men suffer because of this entire apparatus that is rotten to the core. So yeah I can keep criticizing and I can keep elaborating, but the best is really if you watch the movie yourself. And even if it may not be a perfect film, it's relevance when it comes to our society and institutions. Sometimes it is maybe too much of a sob story and sacrifices an ounce of realism for it, but it's okay. You will definitely be touched watching this movie. For me, it is definitely among the very best of the year I have seen so far, maybe even the number one. And even with the two lead performances being so strong, I cannot deny that the film's greatest achievement is the screen play. Now what are you waiting for. Go watch this film if it plays anywhere near you. You really don't wanna miss out here. Heart-wrenching stuff.",

He won the Palme d'Or in Cannes Film Festival for this movie and it also won the BAFTA for Outstanding British Film of the Year. It is one of the best films that came out in 2016. In my opinion, it deserved all the praise it received cause it affected me on a personal level and the feeling stayed for several days. Lots of research was done by the director and screenwriter Paul Laverty, his longtime collaborator before filming began. They interviewed people who worked in the Department of Work and Pensions as well as the beneficiaries and incorporated their experiences.A man, suffering under the system and being denied his rights. I thought these types of things only happened in my country, but disappointingly this problem is everywhere. The director presents the starkly realistic struggle of a carpenter, Daniel Blake (Dave Johns), applying for support allowance. He befriends a single mother, Katie (Hayley Squires), with two kids also struggling due to the faulty state system. We see their friendship develop and helping each other through difficult situations, but the hope for justice proves futile.The characters, the acting, and the dialogues are so realistic that it resembles a documentary rather than a film. The acting by the actors is nothing short of brilliant. Dave Johns's portrayal of a proud, honest and compassionate character is one of the best, and I sympathized with his predicament. I clapped for him while watching an act of rebelliousness by him. The direction is pure and Ken Loach's talent for creating emotional moments is praiseworthy.The screenplay by Paul Laverty is original and avoids unnecessary cliches. The colors have a tinge of gray representing the cold-hearted world. The film elicits genuine sympathy for the characters and does not cheat our emotions by using sentimental music, in fact, there is no background score at all. The actors do the hard job of making us feel emotionally drenched. It is a movie that needs to be seen at least once.",

Winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, the film has a social conscience and does not hesitate to pull out all the emotional stops, but is unfortunately undercut by an excessive amount of speech making, contrived situations, and sentimentality. Performed by British stand-up comedian Dave Johns, the film is guaranteed to bring laughter, tears, and also anger at the system's coldhearted bureaucrats who know about rules and regulations but not so much about people's needs.The film opens with a black screen. Slowly, we begin to hear a man being interviewed by a woman who identifies herself as a health-care professional. Having to answer lame questions about his cognitive abilities and motor skills but nothing about his heart, Dan tells the interviewer, \"We're getting further and further away from my heart.\" He has been told by his doctor that he is not ready to go back to work and has applied for an Employment and Support Allowance, a stipend paid to those unable to work because of a disability. Unfortunately, the government concludes that he is fit for work, forcing him to appeal to the \"decision maker\" to change the ruling.Forced to jump through a set of hoops just to earn the right to appeal, Dan must prove that he has spent 35 hours a week looking for work. Applying for Jobseeker's Allowance and not being computer savvy, he has to seek help just to learn how to use a mouse. When he meets Katie (Hayley Squires), a young single mother with two small children (Briana Shann and Dylan Phillip McKiernan) who has just come from London and is in need of assistance, the story becomes about people working together to provide mutual support in dealing with a faceless bureaucracy.Dan and Katie become friends with Dan offering moral support and using his carpenter skills to make her flat more livable. Katie looks for work as a cleaner, sacrifices food to make sure her children are fed, and is even forced to work briefly as a call girl. One of the most heartbreaking scenes occurs at a visit to the local Food Bank when Katie has a breakdown after opening and eating a can of baked beans, but both are resilient and determined not to let the system crush them.I, Daniel Blake, without question, comes from a good place and Blake captures our allegiance with his grumpy determination, kindness and concern for others, but there is little room here for nuance, balance, or objectivity. The film exists to make a point and everything else is subordinate to that. Though the performances are first-rate and Johns has perfect comic timing, I, Daniel Blake is not, in my view, one of Loach's better efforts.",

Ken Loach has made wonderful, deeply moving films about ordinary people, but in this case his personal anger prevails.The film shows the uphill struggle of Daniel Blake, a carpenter with heart problems, to get the health benefit he's entitled to, but doesn't receive. He gets lost in a bureaucratic maze of incomprehensible regulations and hostile staff members. What makes it even worse, is his inability to work with computers. Now that in large organizations human contact is being replaced by online procedures, that turns out to be a major problem.These kinds of difficulties are real and very troubling for many people. And Loach is right in bringing them up. I myself have experienced similarly maddening procedures. The tendency to move interactions with government institutions almost entirely to the internet, is causing huge problems for thousands of people.But in his urge to show how disrespectful government institutions treat ordinary citizens, Loach is overdoing it. Daniel Blake and his neighbour, unemployed single mother Katie, are so miserable that it is no longer believable. Every imaginable misfortune is happening to them. In the end it becomes pathetic.And that is a pity, because it is undermining the power of the film. It is a bit like a James Bond movie: Bond can narrowly escape death once or twice, but when this happens fifteen times it's not serious anymore. The same goes for the misfortunes of Daniel Blake.

Unfortunately and surreally for him, the state has declined to give him a health welfare so without the help of anyone, Daniel has to manage to get his welfare back.Having never and sadly ever experienced a Ken Loach film before going in (he is one of the directors I still need to catch up on), I really did not know what to expect going in, all I new was that this film had won the Palme D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. What I came out with was a deeply satisfying human drama, with incredible sensibility and delicacy in handling a situation that demands to be treated so.Ken Loach is definitely a filmmaker I will look into after this: his world is as simple and as close to reality as it is possible to achieve in this medium, yet it is filled with a wide range of emotions, all of which the viewer manages to come close to. This is a film where the small moments of life, where the everyday gesture or decision bears a weight to character and story and when higher dramatic stakes come into play, they manage to keep that realistic and grounded feel to the tone of the world, whilst still managing to hit the gut of the audience and touch them, without ever tripping into melodramatic or sentimental territory.The techniques employed to tell this story just as simple as the story itself and that is what makes them as effective as they are. This is a textbook example of how to reflect the content of a story through the medium with which you tell it. Interestingly enough, though both story and storytelling are kept as laid-back as possible the stakes the viewer experiences are kept at a very high level and that is ll again thanks to the effectiveness of Loach's filmmaking throughout the whole film.Firstly, half of the job is done in casting here. The two lead roles are cast perfectly and there are no other words for it. From the way the actors look, the innocence the manage to convey from their sole presence, to the fact that they are both two widely unknown faces and ultimately to the performances they deliver in which both actors have to touch highs and lows of emotions, yet they never go for a showy performance and stick perfectly to the tone of the overall picture, touching those extremes with incredible subtlety and remarkable physical work.Furthermore, how the film is shot and edited just makes the most sense it could. The camera is rarely moving and if it is, it is only slightly and slowly moving, without ever shifting its focus in the same shot. Loach favors wider angle shots where all the action takes place and spares the editing for the most important parts which is fittingly done in the most straightforward way as possible, in order not to distract needlessly neither the audience nor the character action. The result is a film where we enter the characters space and get know them very intimately. We grow to care about these people almost instantly and get behind their struggle, we experience their difficulties with them. The filter of film is almost removed from the audience, this is a feature where you truly get close to the dramatic arch, yet most interestingly the tone and intention of the film is to stay grounded and real, so what you end up with isn't an epic journey or a classical drama of big moments: it is a portrayal of real life that gives you an inner look into what is a reality that you have no hesitation in believing and getting sucked into.If anything, the film has problems only when trying to convey its message which might come out wrong at times because of how the state department is sometimes, and only sometimes portrayed. One might say that this is reality and this is how mad things actually are, but since this is a film I have to admit that our characters were being given a little too much of a hard time at times by people who seemed one dimensional as*holes, who didn't really belong in a film where reality and its complications is given such a dignified portrayal. Thematically it really undercuts a film that is trying to say something and it succeeds in doing it very frequently, but, without wanting to spoil anything, how some of the events unfold and how some of the secondary characters are treated, especially in the second half, deviate some of the more powerful and effective themes I was gravitating towards to, in favor of social (and government) commentary that other than being cheap and ineffective, undermines what is for the rest a beautiful and moving picture about the complexities of living and ultimately a portrayal of poverty and middle and lower class that is respectful, moving and honest as very few films have ever managed to be.",

Its power is in the tone - it isn't a biased, left-wing propaganda piece or an obvious work of protestation. It merely makes known what isn't, and subtly educates through cinema.The film examines the gaping holes within the safety net that is supposed to catch the most vulnerable people in society when they are in need of financial support. In Daniel Blake's case, that lifeline is tragically too little and too late.When you consider that Loach also made the masterpiece Kes, you realise that this man is one of the few, truly great British directors of our time.",

            "review_title": "Daniel Blake, Christ in disguise?",
            "content": "\"I, Daniel Blake\" is a well-made, touching, socially conscious, and multi-layered film. I give it 9 out of 10, a point short of a masterpiece, only because its social criticism is sometimes \"too direct.\" I tend to prefer more articulated and subtle forms of criticism.Daniel is the lead character of the story. He is in his early 60s, an experienced carpenter who cannot work anymore due to his recent heart attack. Halfheartedly, he has applied to receive social support (aka Employment and Support Allowance), but has encountered a dysfunctional and inhumane institution. Another main character is Katie, a single mother with two young kids. She, also, has unsuccessfully turned to the UK's social support system, and same as Daniel, has been disappointed. In her ultimate despair, she turns toward prostitution. Daniel and Katie meet each other early in the film and become good friends. They help each other, presumably, without any earthly demands or expectations. The film ends with a speech by Katie who narrates a letter on behalf of Daniel, posthumous.As far as I can see, the main elements and symbols of the story are as follows:Neighbor: China is Daniel's neighbor. He is a lively and energetic boy in his 20s and makes a living semi-illegally. He has a warm and frank relationship with Daniel. In addition to China, the theme of neighbor has a wider presence in the film. In the speech by Katie, Daniel refers to \"I look into my neighbors' eyes\". Here by \"neighbors\", Daniel mean \"fellow citizens.\" He is not ashamed of them, because he has paid all his duties. In addition, we know from the film that he usually has a simple and good relationship with people of his neighborhood and wider society. Therefore, we can conclude that all the members of society are, somewhat symbolically, his distributed neighbors.Carpenter: Daniel is a carpenter. He cannot work, due to his medical conditions, but he is always available for useful activities. His background as a carpenter is quite pronounced in the film. He seems to constantly engage in making wooden objects in his leisure time at home. When Daisy, Katie's daughter, asks Daniel \"Are you a soldier?\", he replies \"No. I am more dangerous than that. I am a carpenter!\"Prostitute: Katie who is rejected by the UK's social system is forced into prostitution. Daniel is her main, and apparently only, friend.Fish: Daniel carves wooden fish and use them in decorative objects. Fish is his main icon. He gives one of his handmade objects to Daisy. Later, when he has to sell his furniture to a second-hand dealer, he refuses to sell his hand-tools and the decorative thing which he has built with wooden fish. \"They are not for sale\", Daniel says.Privatization, dysfunctional institutions, and the authoritarian state: In the social support offices, there are many references to the fact that social services have become increasingly privatized, and run for private profit, rather than the public good. If I am not wrong (English is not my mother tongue), I think I heard a short reference to privatization of police. The state is presented as a cold, distant, techno-centric, and rather brutal institution. The fact that some groups of society, like Daniel or Katie, are excluded from its support is presented as a rule, rather than an exception. In many shots, we see warning signs which inform the coverage of the area by security cameras. Security guards are present, vocal, and confident, more than the employees who are supposed to help the underprivileged citizens. The dysfunctional institution is not delivering what it is supposed to deliver, but this does not stop it to call the police when there is a small dissidence, and the police arrives within minutes, ready to impose the cold rule of law on the voiceless protester.Change: Daniel has trained hands and knows how to make and fix things. But he is computer illiterate and runs into problem when he is forced by an increasingly computerized public services. The younger generation are computer literate. But this generational gaps is not one directional. It goes both ways. When Daniel wants to play a cassette for Daisy, she has no clue what a cassette is and how it can be played in a player.*****I think many of these symbols are there to construct a parallel with the story of the Jesus. Jesus, too, was a carpenter by profession. He also emphasized on the importance of neighbors, in a very special and universal way (the story of the good Samaritan). He and Mary Magdalene, a prostitute woman, became good friends. He belonged to the underprivileged parts of society, and focused on the poor and the marginalized. Eventually, he was murdered by the state. Perhaps, Ken Loach and Paul Laverty (the writer) are trying to tell us something by embedding these symbols in the story.Jesus was a peaceful but radically revolutionary figure. He was killed by the state, but ultimately transformed an empire. Are the film makers telling us that the likes of Daniel Blake are modern Christ-like figures in disguise?",

            "content": "I don't think I have ever walked out of a cinema feeling more angrier and upset after watching a film. But last night was a first. The reason? Ken Loach's film \"I, Daniel Blake\". Why? It challenges to show the decay of society that we all know is happening, but prefer to ignore because it's not happening to us personally (yet!) For anybody who is still struggling to understand the results of the recent Brexit referendum,(and quite possibly the American Presidential Elections) I would recommend watching this film. The unlucky, the ill, the struggling, the poor, and those who now have no hope left are bleakly portrayed through real and believable characters.While selfishness from older voters, lack of education and racism are widely claimed to be the factors behind the support for Brexit, the film cleverly dismounts all of these, leaving the elephant in the room as the continuing decline of society, rising poverty and governmental response to the real problems of the working class. As one of the most abandoned areas of Europe, all of the North East of England voted for Brexit with the narrow exception of Newcastle where curiously the film is based. You start to understand why no-one there has any reason to vote to maintain a political system that is so obviously rigged against the the working class and their destruction.Yes. I would highly recommend \"I, Daniel Blake\". But be warned, it's not comfortable viewing for anybody. In a surrealistic modern day \"Catch 22\" situation Daniel Blake, a 59 year old carpenter after suffering a heart attack, is declared medically unfit for work. He then needs to confront a state welfare system that is not only completely deficient, but politically designed to further exclude those who it claims to help. What could be just a dark comedy rapidly turns into extremely uncomfortable viewing.My congratulations to Ken Loach, the actors and the entire team who made this film. A stark lesson in both social and political sciences for today's society and those in power who claim to represent us.Ironically, the film was made with funding from the European Union. It's about the nearest thing to a joke in the entire 100 minutes.",

            "content": "Right from the opening credits in which the title character argues with a \"health care professional\" against a pitch black screen, Ken Loach fuses wry humour with bleak drama to present a potent look at bureaucracy gone mad here. The plot focuses on a carpenter who finds himself unable to obtain welfare when his doctor declares him unfit for work since the state's medical examiners disagree. This plunges the ageing man into a near Kafkaesque nightmare, told that the only way he can retain welfare is through jobseekers allowance, which means applying for jobs that he knows he cannot take just to show that he deserves welfare. Modern technology also proves a challenge as forms are only available online and he has never used a computer. The humour regarding Blake's unfamiliarity with computers is arguably a misstep as it mocks him as opposed to bureaucratic red tape, however, it also offers a timely reminder that not everyone is computer literate - and that the most disadvantaged in most desperate need may not even be able to afford a computer. A subplot in which Blake helps a single mother in similarly dire straits adds further dimension to his character. At first, this almost seems a character flaw, helping others yet unwilling to accept help himself (his neighbour offers on multiple occasions) but the emotionally charged final scene suggests that there is something greatly amiss with a system that forces one into such a corner. With the humour gradually declining as the film spirals towards its climax, 'I, Daniel Blake' concludes feeling like a very angry film without answers. This is may not be the inspirational movie one might expect given the premise, but there is something certainly refreshing about how down-to-earth the film feels due to this.",

I, Daniel Blake earned 79 year old British director, Ken Loach his second Palme D'Or and also made Loach the oldest recipient of the award. The social realist film is an extremely powerful and genuine character piece about desperate people living in poverty and the system who does everything but lend a helping hand.I, Daniel Blake follows the life of title character Dan Blake, as he desperately attempts to get back to work after suffering a heart attack. On his mission for an appeal he encounters a single mother Katie, and her two children who have been forced to migrate to Newcastle from their home in London. Their relationship brings a lot of warmth and heart to the film as you see these disenfranchised people help each other because nobody within the system will.Brilliantly acted by Dave Johns and Hayley Squires, the two brings real authenticity to their role, Dave Johns in particular is fantastic as the not very tech savvy, poor man with a rich heart Daniel Blake. Showing off a range from comically angry to absolutely heartbroken you can't watch this film and not love Daniel Blake.The writing and directing both compliment each other perfectly to convey the films messages with such unadulterated power. Writing and Directing duo Paul Laverty and Ken Loach team up again to open our eyes to the issues of the less fortunate in Britain, and how the system ensures they remain less fortunate through every possible loophole. The disenfranchisement of the poor is effectively constructed within this film as well as the lack of care of those higher up than them. You know that the film has worked as it is impossible to not feel angry and disgusted by the events of the film and the treatment of its characters. It's a powerful piece and that's because it's as well written as it is directed.Overall, I, Daniel Blake is a powerful character piece that highlights the desperation of the good hearted, but poorer people in British society and how they are left as outcasts in society due to the state. The acting, writing and directing come together in harmony to deliver the films intentions with great emotion and strength. If I was to sum up this film in one word that word would be \"genuine.\"",

And the jobs are not there anyway.Director Ken Loach, a veteran of social realism akin to the films of the marvelous Mike Leigh, has crafted a Cannes Palm d'Or winning masterpiece called I, Daniel, depicting a good man at the end of his rope, Daniel, and his young friend, Katie with two kids wanting to be productive members of the working class but beaten back by a system and economy that fights them every moment of the day.This is a brilliant small film, with acting far and beyond good, and moments of struggle more poignant than any in the biggest blockbuster this summer. As Daniel fights the system for his right to a subsistence allocation and Katie is forced to become a prostitute, Loach makes a strong and clear statement about the social rules that favor the favored and grind down the unfortunate.Johns is profoundly convincing as a decent blue-collar Brit with much still left to give but caught in the vise of his ailment and the demands of a state not prepared to deal with the ironies of daily living for the unfortunate.

The subject matter, about two people who are on the brink and failed by social services, hardly sounds like a great night out. (We know there are people worse off: do we really want to pay \u00a310 to have our noses rubbed in it?) Spurred on by glowing reviews and suppressing a thought that the money might be better spent giving it to charity, I went along, not least inspired by the fact that the screening was to feature 'a discussion with a panel' afterwards. Perhaps the film would challenge us to come up with good ideas . . .The last two films by the great (and he is great, in his way) Ken Loach that I've seen I've found thoroughly enjoyable. Carla's song was original, surprising and inspiringly insightful. My Name is Joe was gritty but edged with enough humour to hold attention effortlessly. With I, Daniel Blake, Loach uses all his not inconsiderable directorial skill to give an emotional punch to a current outrage: the failing of the U.K. benefits system to help people who are very seriously too ill to work or made homeless with young children to feed and clothe. Loach makes his point well and there is hardly a dry eye in the theatre: but what exactly is he trying to do here?If the film had been screened on television. it might have had the social impact of a 'Cathy Come Home' than a 'Poor Cow.' The cinema, in spite of it being a special event, was more than half empty. Several MPs and voluntary workers lined up on the stage to make their heartfelt speech. Sadness gives way to suppressed anger: but neither emotions are in themselves a solution.I sat through half an hour of deeply-felt righteousness from the panel, hoping that there would indeed be time for a 'discussion' and mentally prepared what I felt could be a constructive exchange. Whoever is running the government or social services, there is only a set amount of money in the pot. No-one has found a way of implementing a good solution to social inequality. The message between the lines however was, \"It is really terrible\", \"People must be treated with respect\" (which turned out to be inventing another politically correct phrase for desperate people), \"I want the other politicians to see this film!\" (to do what? -- a good point but it was a politician that put it forward and someone, somewhere, at some point, has to come up with *ideas* instead of ways to make others feel guilty/ashamed/sad/angry). The underlying message seemed to be \"Look at us (i.e. volunteers), we are working so hard\" (agreed and hats off, but there is still a problem isn't there?); or from politicians, subtly, it is all their (i.e. the *other* political party's) fault, or (this screening being in Scotland) \"It is all Wesminster's fault.\"None of this should detract from Loach's accomplishment in packing a powerful punch to make his point. That was *his* job. Endless wailing by others after watching the film doesn't really add to it.A great movie in many ways but, Mr Loach, please remember you are a filmmaker, a talented one, and your movies are (unfortunately) not going to change the world.",

According to Iain Duncan Smith, however, it 'takes the very worst of anything that can ever happen to anybody, lumps it all together, and then says: this is life absolutely as it is lived by people.' In fact the film's veracity is supported by people with first-hand experience of the benefits system, and the number of claimants who have died following acute benefits problems runs to thousands. In Parliament on 2 November 2016 Jeremy Corbyn raised the particularly shocking case of David Clapson, an ex-serviceman aged 59, who starved to death after benefit sanctions.I had experience of the Employment Service myself in the 1990s, following unfair dismissal. The regulations were less strict then, and Jobcentre staff were just quite brusque at times but generally OK. At one point, though, I was wrongly accused of benefit fraud and threatened with the bailiffs \u2013 a horrible experience, for which I only got an offhand written apology.What the film portrays, in quasi-documentary style, can truly be called institutional sadism: a system that inflicts humiliation and desperation, as when Katie is sanctioned after being five minutes late at the Jobcentre and Daniel is asked ludicrous questions about his health, forced to seek work though deemed unfit by his doctor, and, above all, faced with endless obstacles to his appeal for Employment and Support Allowance. The 'target culture' is seen to reduce claimants to mere statistics, and in the background lurks a sinister unseen figure: 'the Decision-maker'.Daniel does, however, get some sympathy from one Jobcentre adviser, and at first I thought Katie's hardships were worse than his \u2013 but he resolutely refuses to see himself as a victim even though his life is relentlessly laid bare; the great song by Labi Siffre, 'Something Inside So Strong', comes to mind.Katie's sacrifices, as a single mother with two children, are deeply moving. Forced to move from London to Newcastle, she has had to face \u2013 by implication \u2013 'social cleansing'. Daniel's relationship with her and the children is quite delightful for much of the film, though, and there is some nice humour.Benefit claimants are too often vilified and stereotyped as scroungers (e.g. in the title of a programme shown on 5 Star on 30 October 2016, the day I saw this film: 'On Benefits: Living the High Life'). All too often people in Britain are kicked when down, even by MPs and ministers. Through Daniel Blake and Katie Morgan, Ken Loach has characteristically struck a blow for their dignity. This film is fully worthy to stand alongside 'Cathy Come Home'.",

Because it reveals the cruelty against the economically weaker families and computer illiterate old men.It is only this much short to be called a documentary film. I mean it was very realistic with cinematic dialogues, otherwise a documentary. This is a message film, highlights what's wrong with our system and who are all suffering from it. The actors were great and the 80 years- old director had done a magnificent job. You could watch as many films you want, but if you fail to watch a film like this often, there no meaning getting into film watching business.The story follows a 60 year old widower whose name mentioned in the title. As he is recovering from heart attack and as advise given by his doctor, now he's out of the job and support allowance. Whenever he approaches the officials to look his issue, they always come up with different reasons to send him back disappointing. Especially not being into the computers, he struggles to fill forms on the internet platform.He's very patience and following everything they have told him to do. One day he comes to aid to a single mother with two kids who recently moved to the city from London, when she is too struggling in the employment agency to get a job. So their relationship grows as they lend hands to one another in tough times. Following, how they recover from the issues they are facing is what the film to cover in the remaining parts.\u275dListen, you know, you give me a plot of land, I can build you a house. But I've never been anywhere near a computer.\u275eI liked this the film, but I think it was too realistic for my kind of taste. Because I like emotional parts and in this film those parts were highly effective, but not sentimentally striking way. Maybe you can say, less music with more dramatisation changed the storytelling style. Though the focus given on economically lower class and their way of life, not intentionally, but lack of support in society, all these were well detailed. I have always supported films that point outs flaws in basic establishment in society.Almost all the major struggling juncture one goes through in the employment agency, particularly if the person was old is uncovered. Like the telephone calls responding to the recorded message, online applications, as well as meeting them in person. What we're facing right now in the world is or to know is, not everybody is a computer literate. It'll be in the future, but not now. They are not getting proper help, particularly agency treating them like the illegal immigrants.In addition the film gets more interesting when a single mother was introduced. On the other side, different issues faced by poverty ridden small family, particularly her desperate attempt to fulfill the basic needs of her children is heartbreaking. This is not just the English problem, but everywhere else in the world. It had won several awards, particularly one BAFTA award. A good film for everyone, only if you understand the notion of the film or else will be a boring film.While I was watching it, I thought it was a regular kind drama, so I kept expecting that things would turn this and that way. For almost the entire film, but it's only in the final stage something it came up with to surprise me. So my advice is keep low expectation and be patience. More importantly accept what it reveals than what you want from it. If you fail on that, then its not your film and to know that the only way is to watch it.7\u00bd/10",

We already got that he wasn't internet savvy so making him out to be a complete idiot spoiled otherwise good scenes.

Both that and I Daniel Blake was made or co-produced by the BBC.The film is a flawed polemic, a challenge to the Tory government's continuing austerity policies.Daniel Blake is a carpenter who has suffered a heart attack. His doctor has signed him off work. However he cannot get disability benefits because an assessor deems him fit to work.Daniel tries to get through the benefits system such as applying for Jobseekers Allowance, appeal for his disability support refusal but he cannot get to grips with IT and apply for the benefits online.Daniel looks for work to keep the Benefits Agency happy. He knows he is not fit to work if he is ever offered a job. The odd person at the benefits agency try to help out but Daniel is lost.He befriends a single mother Katie who has been sent up to Newcastle from London. She is also struggling to claim benefits. Daniel helps her with some DIY in her new accommodation, he takes her to the food bank.I found this to be an infuriatingly flawed film. Like some middle class person's version of how the underclass survive. So you get the odd bit of shoplifting and being forced into prostitution.For a previous job, I had training on welfare benefits. I helped people out to fill forms, even do benefit appeals. It was not my main job, I just needed to know enough and signpost claimants to the right people who could help them. It is a case of knowing how to fill the forms and there are people out there who know how to do it.Maybe Daniel Blake has worked his whole life and does not understand the benefits system as he never had to claim it. The last people you go to for help is the staff at the Benefits Agency. I just could not fathom how he could not find or someone could just nudge him to the Welfare Rights Service, they do have one in Newcastle. They would had helped him to complete the forms.The film just had a hollowness about it and I liked Cathy Come Home, a drama that was made before I was even born. This is a slice of 'it's grim up north' and it rang false.I, Daniel Blake was the first British film since The Mission in 1986 to win The Palme d'Or. You cannot find two contrasting films even though both tried to tell stories about the human condition.",

It stars Dave Johns as Daniel Blake, and Hayley Squires, a down-and-out single mom who is befriended by Blake.As the movie opens, we learn that Blake has suffered a heart attack. His doctor tells him that he'll be OK, but he can't work at his job as a carpenter for a while yet.Automatic disability, right? Wrong. Blakes runs afoul of the person who \"scores\" disability. In an unethical (and maybe unlawful) act, she declares that he's not temporarily disabled.The plot takes off from there. It's not an easy movie to watch. In fact, it's hard to take when you see a decent man being beaten down by bureaucracy. However, it's an important film to see, even if it makes you uncomfortable. This movie was shown at Rochester's wonderful Dryden Theatre as part of the excellent Rochester Labor Film Series. It will work well on the small screen. I, Daniel Blake has a very strong IMDb rating of 7.9. I think it's even better than that.",

Daniel and Katie are like Christian martyrs, with the dole office taking the role of sadistic Roman legionaries. Do I find it objectionable that the system is unhelpful, maybe that it was even designed to be hostile? Yes. But a fictional movie doesn't do anything more than to increase my prejudices. What if the real people on the dole are maybe more human, more flawed, don't have that die-hard \"I just want to put in an honest day's work\"-attitude?I was watching this movie in a special presentation for teachers, and throughout the movie you could hear sobbing in sighing in the theatre.",

Too much administrative staff lack a total lack of humanity. We will be able to discover, in this film, overwhelming scenes of truth, characters who end up falling into absolute distress and who, despite everything, try to get away with everything, I can say that seeing these scenes of administrative distress and obstinacy, Was in an incredible rage, because YES it exists and YES nobody moves in these administrations managed by certain hierarchies pitiless to the human misfortunes, it is only to see their wages to realize it, but , Alas, they do not give a damn because they Will always be safe from these unfortunates. So much for me, why there is no evolution in these cases, except in the misery it becomes more and more important. To return to the film, this one is of admirable modesty. A film to be discovered, and I can even say that at one time I went through this path of the fighter, finding only blind, emotionally blind people in front of me, it was crazy, but it was a good situation Real and dramatic at the time, from where my best understanding of this very beautiful film received there: \"Palme d'Or at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival\" and many other nominations in other festivals. In conclusion, it is a film punch, which I hope will perhaps awaken a little public opinion, but there I do not believe too much because people only care for them and not Of the misfortune of others, by voting already for the same individuals who govern us all, the time of their mandates. To evolve in a positive way, we must also evolve towards a better understanding of what surrounds us. The two main performers are: \"Dave Johns in the role of Daniel Blake and Hayley Squires in the role of Katie were great with great accuracy in their respective interpretations, which again gave more value to the film. \u00a0A film really to discover, I note 10/10 because it deserves a hundred times.",

If Xxx vin diesel or Logan big bucks blockbuster is your thing this may not be for you but this in my view is cinema at its best .

This was not benefit street fly on the floor documentary where you felt more angry watching , this was ironically more real - you really felt for the characters and those who don't even believe in the ridiculous system they're having to operate . It exposes all the flaws in IDS's failed attempt at shaking up the benefit system under the previous U.K. Coalition government. You'll find yourself cheering , laughing , silently shouting at the screen and crying - it's a film that touches all the emotions. Great acting by Daniel and all of the cast .

I was disappointed in the rather loaded structure of this film because it discredited the messages that I think Ken Loach was trying to get across.Daniel Blake is an angry older man unjustly denied his benefit payments. What does he do? He starts off in a belligerent mood which does him no favours, he spends days moaning about how he can't use computers when the lads next door are clearly computer wizards who help him fill in the form in minutes once he gets around to asking for help. Basically he goes out of his way to make things even more difficult than they need to be. In the dying minutes of the film we discover he has actually contacted a claimant's union or benefits lawyer when this should have been one of the first things he should have done. He's portrayed as an articulate and social man so it makes little sense that he spends his time being angry with the system instead of fighting it. All the benefits workers, save one, are portrayed as heartless bastards even though they too are working people living on low wages. It's mostly not their fault, it's the fault of the system, yet they constantly get blamed.I can't help noticing in passing that Daniel Blake has extraordinary skills in woodworking and we see him make a top notch bookcase and exquisite hand-chiselled toys. Clearly he could start making bespoke furniture for toffs and sell his toys at craft fairs and make a small fortune. OK, I'm being facetious but it seriously struck me that that was what he should do.As for the ending it's just a massive cop out. This is a well-made and watchable film with outstanding performances from Dave Johns and Hayley Squires but as an indictment of a rotten and degrading system it tries too hard to make Daniel Blake a victim and almost everyone else a pantomime baddie. I suspect this would have been a better film if it had been called I, Katie and followed her story with Daniel Blake as the minor character.",

I have accompanied friends to the job centre and assessments and if anything, the bureaucratic blocking, sanctioning and obstructive behaviour of state employed minions, many who have to claim their own tax credits and benefits to sustain their employment is actually underplayed. Deliberate government targets to sanction claimants for the slightest of reasons, keeps the churn of uncertainty and living in misery at peak level. NOBODY chooses this life and the vast majority have 'paid in' all their lives but the genius of the government and top 1% is that those with slightly more than nothing are actively encouraged to deride and abuse those less fortunate. Daily programming of 'benefit cheats', 'state scroungers', 'unemployed with 6 kids' in true 1984 state propaganda agenda they keep the vitriol piling up on those suffering. The increase in food banks from 30 to 450 in 7 years clearly shows a failing state and as we speak the NHS is also being driven into collapse. The U.K. is finished, lowest productivity in Europe driven by despair is all obvious and Loach simply holds the door open for it to be seen. Other comment on the social messaging and say they feel uncomfortable with the political messaging, to those people I say that if the cap fits, wear it.

            "content": "I remember when Ken Loach used to make films rich in symbolism which featured characters capable of moral ambiguity living thoughtfully crafted stories on the screen. Those were the days.Unfortunately, in the already gargantuanly over-rated \"I, Daniel Blake\" we are treated to none of these things. With this film, Loach's desire to beat his message into viewers' heads has trumped all other considerations relating to the quality of the viewing experience.The story revolves around the struggles of 59 year old Daniel Blake, a skilled workman recovering from poor health, as he attempts to claim benefits from the state. Along the way he befriends and helps single mother of two Katie, who is barely holding her family together in a new city.The message that the director seems to want so very much for us all to understand is that the benefits system in Britain is designed, quite purposefully it would appear, to grind down those unfortunate enough to come across it. There's little room here even to consider that the system may be well-meaning but intrinsically flawed, so extreme is the position taken.This wouldn't be such a problem if the film possessed other cinematic qualities, but these are in short supply as well.Just like in real life, characters in the film can all be very easily separated into good, honest folk or nasty, hate-filled jobsworths. Loach's view seems to be that people who work with their hands must be alright, but heaven help you if you hang a tie around your neck and work with paper, or (cross yourselves) a computer - then you're probably the sort that would push your own grandma into the gutter if there was a quid in it for you.The plot is very hastily pasted together, with very little regard to allowing the story to unfold satisfyingly or intelligently. Key moments in the plot just follow flatly one after the other as if story-boarding was ignored altogether. The script shows a similar need for attention, characters delivering narration-like dialogue as if they were reading aloud the notes in the script margin rather than the lines themselves. It also falls into near-embarrassing clich\u00e9s like the emotionally-mature child-philosopher part that also smacks of lazy writing.There are redeeming features. The cast, particularly Dave Johns in the lead role, give satisfying performances. Johns's lighter moments in the film are particularly well-delivered and the film is genuinely funny at times. But these flourishes don't make up for a very lazy film, both conceptually and in execution.",

In trying to get benefits for time off work (as recommended by his doctor), he gets stuck in a quagmire of bureaucracy. During one bad visit at a government office, he befriends Katie (Hayley Squires), an unemployed, single mother of two young children who has also been mistreated by government workers.\"I, Daniel Blake\" is another courageous film by the team of director Ken Loach and screenwriter Paul Laverty that focuses, in a realistic way, on the downtrodden who are too often ignored. While this is praiseworthy, the downturn is that the overall effect can be depressing and frustrating. While the last half hour was moving in a different direction, a final plot twist thwarted this - therefore preventing the story from adding more richness to its depth.Johns and Squires are terrific in their performances as two society-rejects trying to get by and helping each other out when they can. Despite their hardships, they continue to maintain as much of their humanity as they can. Johns' appeal goes further in scenes when Daniel pokes fun at humourless nincompoops on power trips.The film has some telling (and harsh) statements of modern society and bureaucracy. There is a very noticeable contrast in how kindly the poor are treated at a food bank (run by volunteers) vs. the despicable way they are treated by government departments (run by taxpayer-funded employees). The movie has been criticized for its depiction of government employees. Among this group, there is one such character who seems to stand out as she has more soul and humanity than her peers. The film might have achieved greater depth if it had delved more into her personal story.In any case, this movie is likely to be understood by anyone has ever experienced hard times; anyone who has ever felt empathy for anyone who has experienced hard times; or anyone has ever experienced an overwhelming desire to throttle someone who is an insensitive, incompetent, arrogant, ignorant, overpaid, bureaucratic miscreant.",

I wonder if Ken Loach ever watched the show because as a prequel it's very similar as well as being totally different and I take it Loach is warning us about the future ? Daniel Blake suffers a heart attack and after being assessed by the state as being fit for work is moved from one benefit (ESA) to another(JSA) and this involves having to attend a job centre , the precursor to a federation torture chamber which is populated by heartless , cruel fascists and it's only Blake who has the moral fibre to stick up against the system . Before long he's befriended a young single mother with a young child . Hmmm old bloke befriends single mother ? Nothing suspicious going on there I have noticed some people consider this as a film produced as social realist cinema but it is no more realist than a Terry Nation fantasy show set in the far flung future . I DANIEL BLAKE is socialist myth where the proletariat are victims and it's only the ruling class who can save them . Check the scene where Blake gets a phone call from a prospective employer offering Blake a job where Blake turns it down because \"My doctor says I'm not well enough to return to work\" .

But we only fleetingly see chores like the 9 a.m. CV preparation class whose true function is just to provide yet another hoop for him to jump through; and we never see the endless hours spent on public transport during the rush hour getting to and from these mischievously time-consuming impositions (invariably scheduled first thing in the morning; when attending on time proves you fit for work, yet woe betide anyone who shows up late).",

Indeed, Loach's agenda interferes and reduces his storytelling to mere melodrama at least twice.Take the scene in which a starving Katie visits a foodbank; she is surrounded by fruit, bread and vegetables, yet she messily eats cold beans out of a tin and bursts out crying in shame. Why would she eat this when she could choose food that's far easier to eat? Because Ken Loach wants us to feel bad, that's why.And then there's the ending, which sees Daniel and Katie meeting with an adviser who's confident that he can win his appeal. However, just as the film's mood starts to finally buoy, Daniel keels over and dies in the bathroom. Predictable, very predictable. It's surprising that a veteran director like Loach would use such formulaic emotional manipulation.",

            "content": "In this Ken Loach (Kes, The Wind that shakes the Barley) directed film, screenplay by Paul Laverty (Even the Rain, The Angels' Share), Dave Johns (Dog Town, Mud) stars as Daniel Blake and Hayley Squires (A Royal Night Out, Complicit) as Katie, the single mother.A 59 year-old widower who is recovering from a heart attack, Daniel has been advised by his doctor and other health professionals that he is not well enough to return to work but when he is assessed as fit for work meaning he cannot receive benefits, he enters the surreal world of looking for a job he knows he is not well enough to take.When he sees a single Mum, new to the area and understandably late for her appointment, he tries to help, but Sheila (Sharon Percy: School for Seduction, The Student Prince) is one of the workers who revels in the red tape of their job rather than helping and she insists that security and the job centre security manager (Stephen Clegg in his first role) make them both leave, efficiently doing their job as gatekeepers for the 'decision maker.' As Daniel does odd jobs in her new flat, he gets to know Katie and her two kids, Daisy (Briana Shann in her first role) and Dillon (Dylan Phillip McKeirnan, also in his first role) and they form a strong bond as they try to survive the system that seems determined to ruin their lives.Johns and Squires are superb as these finely drawn characters that never for a moment don't feel real. Shann feels a little too well spoken for the role, but her acting is spot on, but some of the other actors are not as good yet it never detracts from the film.This is a powerful film, not shying away from the moral truth of this sad reflection of today's society. Neither Daniel or Katie are trying to 'play the system' and for this they are punished and pushed to their limits. Not a man to take charity, and one who is more used to helping others whether it be caring for his ill wife or his friendship and moral support to a young woman who is essentially a stranger, the film shows how Daniel's former work colleagues and neighbours offer help when he is in crisis, but as a proud man, he does not want to put anyone else in hardship in ease his suffering.A gritty reflection of a struggle many face, even the colour palette mirrors the slow descent of both of them as the system breaks their spirit. Dry humour intersperses the gloom, when we see Daniel attempting to use the internet to fill in an on-line form or attending a mandatory CV writing workshop, but the grim spectre of helplessness pervades everything. The food bank scene, when circumstances break Daniel and Katie's friendship and when Daisy tries to re-establish contact are particularly heart-wrenching and you can clearly see them deteriorate both mentally and physically.You could have heard a pin drop throughout most of the movie and at the end, I genuinely don't think there was a dry eye in the house. I think every MP and worker within the system should be made to watch this film. No-one should have to go through something so heartless and inhumane. It is about time compassion was brought back.An authentic portrayal of an all too real situation that any ordinary person could find themselves in.",

Soon, he meets a lady in a similar condition, she has two kids. Gradually the lady and kids become a part of the old man.The movie begins with a slight humor, and continues in black humor, conquer our heart and leaves a great pain; making it an unforgettable movie of our life.The movie portraits that the reality called hunger and the villain called poverty is not only in the under developed or developing countries, also it is in the West. The situation is no different in the government offices as well. Being an Indian, I can very well understand the movie.There are many interesting, entertaining and touching moments in the movie. For instance, the new generation kids have no idea of what a \"Cassette\" is and how to use it. The surprise of the protagonist Daniel when he knows that the application form was easy to print just like that, but he was going in round again and again for the same, or he was made to, by the carelessness and prejudice mind of the officials.On the Q&A section after the movie, the hero Dave Johns aka Daniel Blake said that, he never had such an experience in his life. May be not in the West, but, this is a very common story in my country, India.This movie shows the beauty of simplicity in film making is not the sole property of Iranian films. A beautiful movie that will touch your heart and remain for long.Highly recommended!",

            "content": "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning 59 year old Geordie carpenter Daniel Blake (Dave Johns) has recently suffered a massive heart attack, but has still been deemed 'fit to work' by an anonymous 'assessor' for the DWP. Understandably, this is a decision he intends to appeal, but he finds himself up against a brick wall of bureaucracy and red tape as he attempts to do so. In the heat of all this, he meets and befriends Katie (Hayley Squires), a single mother of two from London who has been forced to relocate hundreds of miles away to Newcastle on account of a lack of decent, affordable housing in the capital. Together, this pair form a human bond that keeps them ticking through thick and thin as their respective situations plummet.With last year's general election casting at least five more years of Tory rule on the country, meaning a further diet of austerity in all walks of life for 'ordinary working people', 80 year old king of gritty social realism Ken Loach has been forced to come out of retirement and deliver this stirring indictment of a failed system that seems to serve to further grind down the downtrodden in society without treating any of them as individual, disenfranchised humans. Loach's drama depicts a grey, indifferent dive into the world of modern day welfare reform and sanctions, a maze of endless phone call hold music, generalised means test questions and a mountain of forms, courses and online applications.In the midst of all this dreariness, some rough north eastern humour punctuates the tide, making it that little bit more endurable, but this is to be expected with stand up comedian Johns in the lead role, and he gives the titular character of Blake an affable, relatable quality that makes him all the more human, whilst not failing to deliver during the more intense, dramatic moments. He's a dramatic powerhouse of a double act with Squires, whose tragic, beaten down character she portrays so realistically. It's easy to surmise that Loach has zoomed in on one of the most hopeless examples of the system failing for dramatic effect, but elements of the screenplay seem to have been extracted from real life cases that have been documented.None of it is really very subtle, and honestly some of the script is quite predictable, and the ending, intended to come off as a shock, you could really see coming a mile off. But that doesn't make the drama or the story any less effecting, and if Loach is trying to hammer his point across, it's only showing some passionate fire in his belly. ****",

            "content": "Every Palme d'Or winner comes with its own set of expectations and last year's winner of Cannes Film Festival's highest honour is no different. Now I, Daniel Blake may not seem most worthy of all the films that competed for the prestigious award but the topic it brings to light with such alarming authenticity not only makes it an essential cinema but timely as well.The story of I, Daniel Blake follows its titular character who applies for state welfare after suffering a heart attack but isn't deemed eligible for the benefits. The plot covers his difficult journey as he navigates through the nightmarish benefits system to get what's within his rights as a citizen and also captures his bonding with a single mother caught in a similar scenario.Directed by Ken Loach, this is my first stint with his works and it's as good a start as any for those wishing to delve into his filmography. The close proximity its set of events maintains with real life scenario throughout its runtime makes it relatable on a universal scale and it's directed with grace, elegance & a biting flair, all kept in equilibrium by its sharp, zany & involving script.The critical stance it takes against the welfare system is more aimed at the nonsensical procedures that make the whole process more complex & frustrating for the clients, and while it only depicts a certain demographic, the struggle that results from such service is perceivable to all. It has its amusing moments but the sense of despair & disillusionment is evident at all times.With no score to accompany, no striking camera-work or unorthodox editing, the emphasis remains on its story & characters, and while Loach does a terrific job to handle the story element, the cast bring its scripted people to life with credence. Leading from the front is Dave Johns as Daniel Blake but he's finely supported by Hayley Squires who manages to steal a few moments all by herself.On an overall scale, I, Daniel Blake is a stimulating piece of smart storytelling that's as endearing as it is heartbreaking. Bringing to surface an issue that has gradually become a matter of concern yet often goes unnoticed in the grand scheme of things, it is an excellently directed, deftly scripted & aptly performed drama that's carefully handled, comfortably told & is engaging for the most part.

            "content": "Ken Loach's I, Daniel Blake is the type of movie that plays well in places like New York's Upper Left Side and in Berkeley. It's about two people being screwed by a system that treats them as cases and statistics and problems to solve, but never as human beings. Meanwhile, these two people find each other, and find ways to help each other to survive.It's a story that could well be true, portraying a situations that happen to many of us when we must deal with the government or with large corporations, or with large corporations deputized by the government,like health benefits corporations. The movie has emotional power, and one cannot help but identify with the lead characters. One is a carpenter not allowed to work because of fragile health, but not allowed to collect welfare because he is too healthy. The other is a single mother priced out of London, who moves to Newcastle because there she can get better housing, but who receives too little assistance to be able to feed both herself and her children.The movie loses me for two main reasons: first is the lack of subtitles--they speak a different sort of English in Newcastle than they speak in the USA, and I missed at least a third of the dialog, maybe more. Some aspects of the plot were lost to me because of that.And then I thought that the characters were too pure and flawless, and the plot seemed to imply that all those caught in the system are virtuous, and the abuses of welfare are minimal. That the system is designed solely to ferret out worthy applicants and make them fend for themselves. Thus, the film comes across as preachy, as a teaching film, and one loses the sense of watching real people in real situations. And likely this film will mostly be preaching to the choir.",

            "content": "I went with a friend to a special preview screening of the movie. Pre to the screening, one of the movie's production team spoke to the audience to explain how this was a very important movie, that required word of mouth to ensure it was seen by the masses. This is an unashamedly political movie by Ken Loach. But no surprises there. It's a tough movie. Its a movie that makes you angry and sad and frustrated. Is it, however, an accurate movie? Is it as important as Ken Loach wants us all to believe?Here lies my problem with this film. As a piece of storytelling its a strong movie. Its a movie that really shines a light on the misery of being caught in the benefits trap that exists for some people. The characters are great... engaging, lovable, pitiful, nice 'citizens'. If the movie was purely telling a story about these two main characters (and the children) and highlighting how the system is flawed for these two characters only...then it is a success with spades.But I believe the movie is essentially trying to portray all people caught up in the benefits system as poor unfortunates who are all outstandingly good individuals. There is the issue. For every Daniel Blake - there is a Benefits Street candidate. For every Katie there is a Dee. I grew up in Tyneside (where this movie is set) on a council estate where the vast majority were 'on the dole'. I witnessed the widespread abuse of the benefits system by people who were as far removed from the characters portrayed in this movie as could be. I therefore found it hard to truly feel the emotional impact that I know others will feel.Does the movie highlight some of the harsher issues currently being faced by people like Daniel Blake? Yes it does. Is that acceptable? No its not. The story of Katie, was for me the stronger. A single Mum doing her absolute best under very difficult circumstances. The food bank scene is terrible to watch, but brilliantly acted. The main thrust of the story is Daniel Blake's predicament. Highlighting how a person who has suffered a heart attack, and is unable to work due to medical advice can be rejected Disability Support Allowance by the 'independent' assessment system and then forced into Job Seekers allowance (and the online emphasis thereafter - and proof of looking for work) is extremely well constructed. But Ken Loach wants us to believe this system is 100% flawed for all people. It simply isn't. But when it goes wrong.....the human impact is terrible. That is the story....I wanted that to be clearer. I wanted the movie not to become Left Wing Socialist propaganda. It ended with Daniel Blake being tagged the 'Citizen' with appropriate badges given out at the end of the movie..... A overt political cry for Left Wing Socialism. But this is Ken Loach after all. Sadly, this turned me off, and after spending an evening reflecting, I believe ultimately that will damage the movie for many others too. I completely sympathized with the main characters (you couldn't not), but do not accept that the system is as malicious as it was portrayed. The stereotypes for all Management and Establishment was too much. The convenient way the movie tries to brush off benefit abuse (such as applying for jobs to tick a box to receive benefits - with no intention to work) was too convenient. Not all people or citizens out there are as good as Daniel Blake. I am fine to accept the message (and premise) that the system should be flexible enough to adapt to Daniel Blake's (and that should have been the whole message) but do not accept that the system should allow everyone free reign to live on benefits without any forms of control. Would I recommend this movie. Absolutely. Will I take to the streets afterwards. No.",

            "content": "BBC Films (BFI) production. Palme d'Or winner (2nd win for Ken Loach).This an extremely emotional film with a political foundation. The film focuses on two individuals, Daniel and Katie.Dave Johns is Daniel, a 59 year old carpenter and a widower, who has recently suffered a heart attack. The film starts with a simple black screen with an audio recording of Daniel on a phone interview, dealing with an impersonal and heavily scripted Healthcare Adviser. The answers he gives result in 12 points, rather than the 15 required to claim benefits. Daniel gets JSA and is forced to create a CV to circulate for jobs he is unable (unfit) to take. He is internet illiterate, and is finding it difficult to get to grips with the online world, although the DWP is digital by default. Daniel also needs to prove he is actively searching for work or he will lose some benefits. When he is finally offered work he has to turn it down on his doctor's advice so he gets sanctioned and the downward spiral continues. Daniel's resulting anger is something that we can all appreciate. Hayley Squires was excellent as 'Katie', a single mum, forced to relocate to Newcastle due to the expensive rents charged in London. A friendship develops between Daniel and Katie, highlighting the importance of community. Daniel is happy to help struggling Katie because he's a good man with moral values, even despite his own situation. He uses his carpentry skills to help Katie with some simple home improvements, while her ambition is further study, what she calls 'return to her books'. Katie joins an escort agency to earn money for some new school shoes for her daughter, after the ones she has have fallen apart yet again and the resultant teasing from the other school kids.The food-bank scene towards the end of the film (though sensitively filmed ) is particularly heart-wrenching and difficult to watch.The Government appears to be failing the poor and needy, this film is highlighting the problems of coldness and lack of humanity of the system that some of society find themselves in, this film captures brilliantly the frustration of dealing with the DWP. The benefit claim process seems to be deliberately difficult, so difficult that most claimants simply give up, unfortunately most of what we see in this film you can imagine actually happening.Another of Ken Loach's masterpieces 'Cathy Come Home' in 1966 resulted in the creation (or at least the acceleration) of the charity 'SHELTER', this film is bound to cause similar discussions.I watch films several times every week, but this is the first time several audience members have stood to applaud a film at the end.",

            "content": "Anyone who may be under the impression that Britain's great social realist Ken Loach has lost the sense of social injustice that has defined his magnificent track record since his milestone BBC television play Cathy Come Home (1966), may be rest assured that there is a still plenty of fire in the prolific English director's belly. In what feels like an angry reaction to the Tories' austerity measures and the tabloid cries of 'Benefits Britain', I, Daniel Blake feels like a war cry to unite the skilled, working-class grafters who continue to be chewed up by a bureaucratic system that is leaving the elderly and those truly in need behind, forcing them to demean themselves for the assistance and care they truly deserve.In Newcastle, Daniel Blake (played by stand-up comedian Dave Johns) is informed by his GP that he has a heart condition that will keep him out of work for the foreseeable future. Apprehensively, but on his doctor's recommendation, he heads to the Job Centre to sign on. He is eager to get back to work, but is confident that a lifetime of hard manual labour and steady work has surely earned him the right to seek aid in his time of need. He is denied employment and support benefits, despite his GP's note, and is systematically passed from one department to another, each of which require him to fill in a form online (he's so clueless with computers that he runs the mouse up the side of the monitor at one point) and provide evidence that he is actively seeking employment, despite his inability to work. So begins a ludicrous, Kafka-esque battle against a system seemingly eager to make the process as difficult as possible.It's an incredibly depressing subject matter, and a topic which tends to lead to extreme reactions, depending on who you speak to and whose opinion they've recently read and decided they agree with. Yet this is certainly not a depressing film, it's actually incredibly funny. There's a real warmth to the script by Paul Laverty, and a real tenderness to the relationship between Daniel and single mother Katie (Hayley Squires); a Londoner who has been moved up North to the next available residence, itself a damning indictment of the soaring house prices in the capital and the government's eagerness to upscale 'urban' neighbourhoods. Struggling to find a job and faced with the same bureaucratic barriers as Daniel, she starves herself so her children can eat hot food, and is caught shoplifting. Perhaps you've shaken your head at the single mother on the bus struggling to control her screaming children, but Loach shows us what life might really be like for those truly in need.In a truly Loachian touch, there's also much joy to be had in the company of working class. Daniel forms a friendship with his young neighbour China (Kema Sikazwe), a cheeky chap who is selling authentic trainers at a cut-price by shrewdly importing them directly from the warehouse (the scene in which Daniel meets his Chinese contact via Skype is one of the film's most hilarious moments). Despite the serious subject matter and occasional heart- breaking moment, there's a weird sense of optimism to the film's sense of injustice. Like a rallying cry to anyone left behind by the system, a triumphant and incredibly satisfying scene of defiance, from which the film gets its title, occurs towards the end of the film. As one would expect, Loach downplays it, ensuring that his message is properly received with a sobering climax. There's talk of Ken Loach going into retirement, and if this proves to be his final film, he's gone out with a bang, delivering from one of the finest movies of his career.",

The story itself here i can't even call it a story, because it shows a true life, down to the ground. It is a story which happened to thousands, and unfortunately will happen again. Script was realistic and plausible as it gets. It never felt pushed or over-written. Acting by two leading actors was simply perfect as well crystal clear directing. There is no music in this movie, no other \"craftsmanship\" of films - it can be watched as a documentary - it is that good and raw experience. Overall, \"I, Daniel Blake\" is not an entertainment cinema. Its a raw, powerful and heartbreaking look at realities a man must face at the end of his life, when there is seemingly no help and no hope. It doesn't end on a happy note nor there is bright light at the end - yet somehow a man finds inner will to help others by giving what money can't buy - kindness and hope. \"I, Daniel Blake\" is a statement to today's society which can be and is unforgiving to a citizen.

This film is about people struggling to navigate life on the benefits system, where rules and process are more important than people being helped. The situation is farcical, if unfunny, and on more than one occasion I felt myself tearing up at the characters plight. The point is well made, but not over wrought. The actions of the people speak for themselves, and the rare touches of humanity shown by the people in the system are tellingly revealed to be flaws in how they have acted, rather than the correct response.

            "content": "An unemployed man converses with an employed woman, only their voices fill up the black screen. One end clearly misunderstands the needs of her client, just like the business-minded telephone operators we know all too well. The man being berated is named Daniel Blake, and these types of meetings occur daily for him. Too long now he has sought after regular employment, yet his poor health legally prohibits him from that end goal.We all know the government's tendency to mistreat whomever struggles to attain work, a reality amplified through a megaphone by the veteran British director Ken Loach in his weepy drama, I, Daniel Blake. The UK already widely respects Loach, but for those in the US, his work deserves intense study. Every quiet image he crafts pleases the analytical eye, especially his many gorgeous compositions of Daniel walking hands in pockets through the streets. Throughout the somewhat short runtime, Loach makes you lose track of how many minutes pass by as the events tie into a complete account of a man who laughed at defeat in the face.In the first half, Daniel Blake's search offers some nice chuckles structured amongst agitation with authorities who hold back their listening ears. By the second half, Daniel's desperation handcuffs you to his ankles as he runs in circles. After surviving jingle after jingle of incompetent phone operators, Daniel's desperation leaves him furious at everyone, including a random passerby whose dog takes a dump in front of his home. Then after a chance meeting in the unemployment office, the mood starts to change. He meets a young single mother named Katie whom the specialists bully around worse than him, so Daniel channels his frustration into compassion as he offers help in her embarrassment of a home. Daniel soon lightens the mood by teaching her son and daughter how to stay warm with bubble wrap and flower pots. Now neither one of them have to individually obtain financial stability alone.Though despite the temporary positivity, things still go from worse to unbearable. The character study rings true to how job services work: Daniel learns how to use a computer, and Katie suffers a mental breakdown at a food bank. The absence of financial income gradually destroys each of their complexions; Daniel seems grow older as the film goes on; it causes you to think, \"Wow, I have been there before. I wish I could help somehow.\"At least Daniel Blake can offer one gift outside the workforce with his homemade wooden fish mobile, which he uses to inspire the children's self-worth. Yet woodcarving does not fulfill the children's miserable predicament; their tiny home of peeled wood and tile pales against the cold steel of the employment service offices. It turns you desperate as the well-fed authorities stroke their own egos. \u200b In fact, Ken Loach presses a little too much hate toward authority by beautifying unlawful rebellion from the poor. A subplot about Daniel's Black neighbor selling counterfeit shoes contributes little to the plot, besides throwing in a last resort to gaining profit that never receives a rightful punishment. These shoes were acquired by a liaison from China, which in turn worsens the reputation of the already disrespected country. The same goes to anyone above the lower class: an excessively negative shadow casts over their poor productivity; a fair analysis finds no balance between both sides of the issue.On the other hand, Loach's piece of well-researched propaganda might very well be the wake-up call the Jobseekers Allowance needs to see our perspective of their industry. Too few jobs exist for nationwide fulfilment; the system must change.Landing a job in our present era is unimaginably hard for anyone, whether the elderly, new parents, or young adults such as myself. The journey may feel endless, we may even want to practice alternate illegal solutions. Therefore, I, Daniel Blake deserves a watch by all who suffer. Although no one should expect a typical Hollywood ending, a satisfactory solution to life's purpose as a citizen will remind you, the reader, of your power, no matter what the government expects you to think.",

Yet, watching Daniel struggling in the system, and watching him struggling with computers make me really sad. Times change, and many honest and decent people have not been able to move with the times. The story about the single mother is also heart wrenching.

The stark contrast between the innocent protagonists and the malicious civil servants was often overplayed and unrealistic.

Dave Johns deserves every award he gets for this performance as a 59-year old carpenter with a dodgy ticker, battling the benefits system for the first time in his life.All the characters are believable, including Hayley Squires's single mum displaced for economic reasons to the 'opposite corner' of England and also having to battle for existence.Politicians have criticised the film for being unfair to DWP staff. I do not think that is the case. There was still the kind lady who helps Daniel, even if she gets ticked off for it, and attends his funeral at the end. There is some humanity even within our bureaucratic institutions and Ken Loach recognises this.However, most of the kindness comes from those we live amongst. I loved the young black guys who were entrepreneurially getting trainers shipped from their (Stoke City loving) Chinese guy and selling them on the black market - and how they used their IT skills to help Daniel get his JSA application through the malfunctioning government website.The foodbank scene was amazing and Loach's genius is to have his actors improvise interaction with real foodbank staff while he filmed it as a 'fly on the wall'. The lasting impression was of a sanctuary of calm and help at the eye of a storm. Brilliant. Incidentally, someone I know who works at one says those who use them do not generally break into a can of beans because they are uncontrollably hungry. They normally tear open a pack of biscuits.The other iconic scene from the film is Daniel graffiti-ing the wall. I have to give a shout-out to the street alcoholic who encourages him, while mouthing obscenities about Iain Duncan Smith (needed subtitles really). Either that guy is a brilliant actor or the genuine article as he behaved like so many guys I see in my town who have slipped through the net.If I deduct one star from my rating it is that the ending appeared rushed and the speech at the funeral a little preachy. I also wonder if the reality of the system is actually even worse than portrayed here. For example Daniel would have got 0 points on his WCA because, as the opening credits reveal, he has to answer yes to every irrelevant question in the assessment. He was lucky to find a computer at his library as council cuts mean that libraries are closing. No-one mentioned the CAB, which he might have been directed to, only to find they had had to lay off all their benefits specialists when Legal Aid was removed in 2012.But overall, a brilliant film, and deserving of its BAFTA.",

As an attorney, I was shocked by the accuracy in the description of many situations regarding the experience citizens have when in contact with Social Services in general. What hurts the most is the ending was, of course, fashioned to make a powerful statement. Yet there are many Daniels in the streets walking and falling like flies, because of this endless and insane system that took place and seems designed to wither out its dependents. People are dying because they won't treat them as such, though they contributed all their lives. Daniel's demise should give room for a change in the way things are done. But then we look at the reality of it. Thousands of Daniels are dead. And no one moved an inch anywhere. The political statement here made is not really political; it's a plain fact. Taxpayers should not be treated as rotten food, and the current system deals with them. The movie is effective on delivering that message.

For the Department of Work and Pensions, he's an entity, a number, an impersonal element that didn't pass the test that could earn him a disability pension. For his neighbor (Kema Sikazwe), he's a widower and sympathetic old curcumdgeon. And for us, he's a most resourceful and honest man, a product of the Baby Boom generation, a man who does things with his hands as efficiently as his heart and doesn't beg for money but only desires the insurance of a decent living. He's got pride and dignity, he's an old school chap caught in the midst of the dematerialized but no less obstructive (and destructive) bureaucracy,Watching poor Daniel entrapped in the pervert mechanisms of a system that deems him able to work and trying to claim his rights to office workers who remain deaf and blind to his explanations is painful to watch, but it's a cathartic experience nonetheless. We know we're not alone for as long as directors like Ken Loach will shed light on average people promised to a slow downfall because of bureaucratic technicalities, cinema will preserve its nobility. While Hollywood is busy making films about superheroes, here's a touching and minimalist drama that illustrates with the simple language of the camera the struggles of the little people, the forgotten entities of the liberal dream without drowning the material in an ocean of pathos.Indeed, Daniel is constantly active, he tries to reason his interviewers, the security guards, he learns how to use the Internet, and later, we see him helping Kathy, a single mother with two kids by fixing plumbery, crafting and simply making his presence indispensable. He's the handy man and the father-figure a house needs. His obstacle-course of a life allows us to discover the struggle of single mothers. Played by Hailey Squires, Kathy couldn't get her family allowances because she missed the bus and therefore her appointment. trying we also have a glimpse on the fate of a woman who can't get her allocations because she came late, Like Daniel, no one listens to her. Still, there's one worked played by Kate Rutter who restores our faith. They're not all heartless robots repeating the same mechanical shticks, but for her efforts to assist Daniel, her boss tells her off for setting a dangerous precedent. So much for the light of hope.This is not a neutral film, obviously, it's a powerful \"J'Accuse\" against the system and it's Ken Loach after all. But Loach and screenwriter Paul Laverty did their homework before starting shooting, collecting as many items of confidences to build their story. A man losing his disability pension because of a seizure during a meeting, another sanctioned for missing an appointment because of his father's funeral, hardly what Daniel and Kathy went through. Indeed, reality is as surrealistic as Asterix' \"House That Sends You Mad\". But you might lose a little more than your marbles here, money, dignity, life, you name them. Loach deliberately didn't chose a handicapped person because the case would be 'too' obvious, he picked two healthy-looking people to make their case more administratively ambiguous. From our POV, they're responsible enough, which makes their breakdowns more difficult to watch.So we get some harrowing moments such as Kathy opening a tin of beans in the Food Bank (an episode that would earn her daughter mockeries from her schoolmates), we see her shoplifting and almost pushed into the worst possible scenario job-wise and meanwhile Daniel is only forced to trick the system and asks for unemployment benefits. The catch is that he's got to endure these training sessions where they lecture you about these magical 'ten seconds' (and boy, I went through that), he gets insults from a man who genuinely wanted to hire and learned that he only did that to get allowance, and on the phone, Daniel can't even articulate a reason ... too rational to swallow the only medicine he can get. The closest to comedy is the running gag of the phone calls where you've got to endure Vivaldi for hours (again so true to life) and the ultimate breakdown moment where Daniel makes a temporary buzz by tagging his protest on a wall and even mention the music.That scene isn't shown like a triumph but the last burst of rebellious dignity from a man who always kept a low profile and tried to live normally in that world of nonsense. I wouldn't spoil what goes after that scene but in totally unglamorous and un-Dickensian fashion, that fits the depiction of the paupers' lives in Newcastle, Loach provides an extraordinary depiction of a system that is far sneakier than a real movie villain and that contaminated every town of the civilized world. The nightmares of job centers, these places where unemployed people must regularly register, wondering inside how come the people who work there have that job. And Loach reveals that some workers did tell them that they were forced to act that way, many felt ashamed, many didn't even stay, some were fired, which is like imagining former prison guards going to jail. I used the term \"surrealist\" but that fits the purpose of Loach who denounces the fact that these people are supposed to find jobs that don't exist and the real mockery is to make them believe that it's their fault, not enough motivation, not enough guts or a not so eye-catching resume. In the end, they're lazy, they're parasites, it's all their fault.Today, the pandemic is still going, we don't live, restaurant owners see their lifetime investments being dilapidated, but the government ensures us that it's our fault, for not respecting safety precautions. It is a tough world for the little ones, thankfully, Ken Loach is still here to defend all the Daniel Blakes, all the Kathies of the world. A well-deserved second Golden palm win!",

            "content": "I've been wanting to see this film ever since I first heard about it and finally I managed to watch it last night. I've read most of the reviews already posted here and was interested in the varying interpretations and reactions although I personally felt quite a few reviewers were, perhaps, seeing elements that weren't actually there.I'm not going to summarise the story, partly as that isn't the purpose of a review and also because it's been summarised ad nauseum in other posts here.I never got the impression Loach was saying all benefit claimants are good people nor that he was implying the 'working class' were all penalised. I took the film to be a 'snapshot' of two people caught up in the benefits system for different reasons.As someone who later in life has had to go through the benefits process to try to claim ESA so many of the specific instances in this film resonated. I kept nodding as Blake tried to 'go through the hoops' as he tried to get help as I had been through the same type of scenario I think my favourite line, which was almost a 'throwaway one' was whilst Blake was on the phone to the DWP help line, waiting to move up the queue and once he gets through and gets nowhere he says \"at least change the bloody music\". Having spent a long time listening to The Four Seasons extract on a loop whilst waiting for someone to answer the DWP phones I knew exactly how he felt.Perhaps what wasn't made clear enough was that the 'Healthcare Professionals' who conduct assessments are employed by private companies contracted by the government and then report their findings to the DWP for a decision to be made. There has been much in the press about the problems with these assessments and they do appear slanted to ensure as many claimants as possible initially get rejected. It is, perhaps, telling that around 60% of people who do appeal have their claims allowed but there are also a large number who never get that far as they get 'worn down' by the bureaucracy.I partially disagree with those reviewers who said the Job Centre officials were portrayed as unfeeling monsters as they are very tightly constrained over what they are actually allowed to do and the current rules they are bound by leave little room for manoeuvre. I would also take issue with the reviewer who seemed to think Blake would have been able to use a computer, many older people are still internet ignorant either from fear of trying it or having no interest in doing so.So viewed as a 'snapshot' I found this film riveting, it didn't drag, made many salient points and hopefully will make audiences think.It isn't easy viewing and won't leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling when it ends - but I do think it is well worth a look.",

            "content": "I agree with the politics and the moral sentiments of this film wholeheartedly, but the film itself is rather mediocre. It seems ironic to me that this is the kind of fare that could only be appreciated by festivalgoers and the attendees of prestigious art cinemas--people who, on average, have expendable incomes far surpassing those of the characters populating the film. I grew up in poverty and on welfare; nobody in my family would have ever spent their precious free time watching something as tedious as this.The general lack of verisimilitude in the performances is perhaps what made it such a slog for me. Most of the non-professional bit actors--even though they're just supposed to be garden variety social workers, security guards, and such saying fairly commonplace things--seem like they're reading from a script overloaded with symbolic messaging. There's nothing more boring to me than cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 that can't quite nail the v\u00e9rit\u00e9 part. I'd rather just watch a documentary; a real social worker doing her job is far more interesting to watch than a bad actor pretending to be one, even if they're technically saying and doing the same things. Dave Johns, in what I gather is his first real dramatic role (I'm American and have never seen him before, but I gather he's well-known as a stand-up comedian in England), seems like he's reading lines from a page most of the time, trying his hardest to avoid looking at the camera. Hayley Squires is decent, even if her character is a cliche from a nineteenth century naturalistic novel, and the two young actors who play her kids are also quite convincing, but that's about it.It was far too on-the-nose, predictable, saccharine, and tedious for my taste. Its heart is in the right place, but a documentary film or a decent long-form magazine article would have probably succeeded better at engaging me in the issues.",

Instead, I just want to say that this was a very hard film to watch. It is a difficult emotional journey, watching Katie and Dan as they both try to hold on to their dignity. They are both hard working lovely people with good hearts, just trying to find work and in Katie's case, feed a family. It made me sick in my soul to see how they are treated in so many places, how unbending the system is. And then, the people that do help like the shop owner, the sneaker neighbor and the kind people in the food bank, they nourish your soul back again. It's just hard. The embarrassment and humility. I don't think this is the average person in the system in the UK, but I think even if it's only 10% of the people, it's far too many. I know this film isn't for everybody. It's difficult subject matter presented in a linear way. The acting is incredible. Some of the most brilliant delivery, of the most heart wrenching common-man dialogue. The scenes/sets, direction, script - it's all bloody brilliant in the most relatable accessible of ways. This is a champion job for the every man.",

It might have easily happened in Russia or in China (well, maybe not in China, since they don't even pretend to give a damn about their people). So, basically, this film is about all of us.It's an unadorned case of neglect a state gives to a citizen nowadays. Regardless of the fictitious petty details, I, Daniel Blake is a story both quite believable and utterly realistic. A story of a person who just wants to be treated like a human being, but is instead viewed as a liability, a sequence of digits in the computer and a burden to a bunch of tired people doing the so-called social service.And it's also a story of how people help and support each other. Not for money or any other gain, but just because they believe it's the right thing to do. And how much of a difference it might be.Actually, apart from its message, I, Daniel Blake is hardly there, with each episode simply going one after another with no much of a transition. And that's both a flaw and a merit of this film, because, while not being a stellar piece of cinematographic art, it actually feels like a documentary, like a story of real people, not just some made-up characters. And that also means there will be no sweet remedy or some deus ex machina tricks here, just bare realism, which is always a bitter thing for the regular people.Watching this won't make you happier, just like it won't make you believe in any more fairy tales about the great new world we're living in. The problem of this film, however, is that besides telling us that we're neck-deep in sh!t - something most of us know already - it doesn't have much new info. Daniel Blake demands his rights as a citizen and a human being not to be ignored and forgotten, but he definitely doesn't offer any know-how for accomplishing that noble task. And the way even that demand was made is neither gonna leave you happily ignorant nor it's gonna charge you with fury and push you out on the street to protest. It's simply sad, like a poor old lonely man's life - and that kind of sadness is merely depressing and demotivating. Yes Dan, the world sucks, but it's not like you're telling us something new...",

But then, when it was over, when I had time to reflect and collect myself, I realized I had been used, abused and manipulated by a shrewd, Marxist ideologue, Ken Loach, the Roach. Daniel Blake was not a doomed loser. He had marketable skills, which should have given him the ability to determine his own future and independence. In the US he wouldn't have been at the mercy of the grim, grey UK welfare state. In the US he could have made a living with his hands, by being a self-employed fix-it man and/or craftsman of furniture and wood mobiles. He could have set up shop in his garage, not been buried under forms and denied his dignity. He might have listened to Merle Haggard or Lynyrd Skynyrd, not some doomy, gloomy crap on a cassette. No such optimism, individualism or self-reliance is allowed under the Queen or House of Lords, according to Commie Ken. Roach Loach is the problem, not the solution. He is the cause of human misery, not its cure. His far-left Marxism crushes the human spirit and makes us all victims, not heroes. When will we learn? His socialist ideology has failed over and over throughout the 20th century (USSR, China, Cuba, Venezuela, ad nauseam.) The answer is not reform of the welfare state, but its abolition. The answer is to empower humans, not enslave them to government. The sun has set on the British Empire. It deserves no pity, just contempt.",

IMDB does not allow fractional star scores, it deserved the 10.The performances by David Johns and Hayley Squires are magnificent, the screenwriting by Paul Laverty is wonderful. The film pulls you in, absorbs you and refuses to allow you to look away. The brilliance is not that it is harrowing, not that it shocks or sickens, it is that it's relateable.I'm reminded of Requiem for a Dream, a film that grips by the sheer horror that it depicts, but in I, Daniel Blake there is no horror of the abstract, every character could be someone you walk past on the street on any day of your life.

A sixty year old man who has supposedly worked for over forty years in a skilled job yet is penniless? Yes, he's disabled now but... The film comes across as a vehicle aimed to discredit the government. As it happens I don't like the government much either, but this isn't the way to go about it. It won't change anything because to film is so biased. Another Palme D'Or winner, Rosetta, did help bring about change but that was because the Dardenne brothers showed people as they really are, or what the public believe might be true, not a sixty year old who cannot use a computer.

Documentary photographer Robbie Ryan adds realistic touches as this brave crew navigate complex social problems - that are both poignant and timely.

The scene where she stuffs beans into her mouth like a glutton was very shocking.The film is filled with many touching and hilarious moments. Moments that we might all have gone through and made us want to tear our hair out.

More concerned with following rules (the essence of bureaucracy) than helping people with their problems in a time of need, they drive people to despair and to the point of taking often desperate measures to have their voices heard or just to survive, just like Daniel Blake in this film. This film almost has a cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9 feel to it, in the grittiness of it's portrayal of the environment and the people in it. Despite the grimness of it's subject matter, it has moments of humor and heart warming moments of kindness, of one neighbor helping the other and such kindness reciprocated. On the other hand it's a damning indictment of the welfare system in the UK (and elsewhere too, I doubt it is much different) and the impersonal way it treats the often most desperate of society's citizens. The food bank scene was hard to watch, as others have stated. You're left shaking your head and thinking \"People shouldn't be reduced to this\". The ending isn't the ending you wanted for Daniel Blake (I won't say what it is), because you're rooting for the guy and you want him to finally get the break he deserves, but it does help hit the point home. Ken Loach has produced a wonderful film. It will make you laugh and cry, but it will also make you mad, mad that people are treated the way they are. I wish every politician (and welfare case worker) was forced to watch this film and then maybe they would grow some humanity in their souls.

A system failure for the ones who really do need the help of the services they pay into. The truth is this happens,and as sad as it is it usually gets overlooked. People need a system where they are looked at as an individual/family, not as a number and listened too for their individual circumstance. When desperation creeps in and humility and self pride,its a downward spiral of despair. Just not to be listened too and following bad protocol has been enough for people to be homeless or taking their own lives. A really good watch,highlighting true grit,spirit,help and desperation. Ken loach makes these films with messages too all,kindness isn't mandatory,some people help others and some don't. The government trys its best not to help anybody if they can wriggle out of it. AWFUL.",

However, they struggle for the basics to survive, that shouldn't exist today. It's a wake-up call for everyone to help your own communities, give what you can and donate to the local food banks.

            "review_title": "I, Daniel Blake",
            "content": "I had heard the title of this British film a few times, I knew nothing about the concept, but when it was added to the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, that gave me more reason to see it, directed by BAFTA nominated Ken Loach (Kes, Sweet Sixteen, Looking for Eric). Basically Daniel Blake (Dave Johns) is a 59-year-old widower, he works as a construction worker specialising in carpentry, he lives in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Daniel is recovering from a recent heart attack, his cardiologist has not allowed him to return to work, but he is deemed fit to do so after a work capability assessment and denied employment and support allowance. Daniel is frustrated that his doctor was not contacted about the decision, he applies for an appeal, a process which he finds difficult as he is not computer literate and must complete forms online. At the job centre, Daniel witnesses single mother Katie (BAFTA nominated Hayley Squires) being sanctioned for arriving late for an appointment, Daniel feels sorry for Katie and befriends her. Katie and her children have recently moved from a London homeless persons' hostel to Newcastle, there is no affordable accommodation available in London. Daniel helps Katie and her family, repairing objects, teaching them how to heat rooms without electricity and crafting wooden toys for the children. Katie visits the food bank, overcome with hunger she has a break down, then she is caught at a supermarket shoplifting, the manager is prepared to let it go. At the supermarket, a security guard offers Katie job as a prostitute, she goes to the brothel, Daniel shows up there to beg her to give up the job, but she tearfully insists she has no other choice to feed her children. One of the conditions for Daniel to receive jobseeker's allowance is that he must keep looking work, he hands his CV to many places, there is an instance where he gets a call from a scrapyard, but he turns it down, mentioning his doctor and wanting to continue getting benefits, which insults the caller. Daniel attends a meeting with his work coach, but he is told that he must work harder to find a job or be sanctioned, Daniel has become frustrated with the endless, dead-end conversations over the phone with impersonal government health-care and employment agents. After leaving the job centre following another non-eventful appointment, Daniel goes to the side of the building and spray paints \"I, Daniel Blake, demand my appeal date before I starve\" in big letters on the wall. Daniel sits under the graffiti, many passing people, including other benefits claimants, show their support and praise, until he is arrested and warned by the police, following his arrest Daniel sells most of his belongings and becomes withdrawn. It is the day of Daniel's appeal, Katie accompanies him to court, a welfare adviser tells Daniel that his case looks sound, but Daniel becomes anxious when glimpsing at the judge and the doctor. In the end, Daniel visits the lavatory, where he suffers another heart attack and dies, at his funeral Katie reads the eulogy, as well as his speech he had written for the appeal, it describes Daniel's feelings about how the welfare system failed him by treating him like a dog instead of a man proud to have paid his dues to society. Also starring Dylan McKiernan as Dylan, Briana Shann as Daisy, Sharon Percy as Sheila, Kate Rutter as Ann and Kema Sikazwe as China. Johns is a comedian (he has appeared on 8 Out of 10 Cats), he makes a splendid dramatic debut, Squires is also fantastic as the single mother struggling to support her young children. The film incorporates both humour and hard-hitting issues to show the hardships of the British health and employment support systems, I myself was on jobseeker's allowance, so I know how difficult it can be and could relate with the characters, it is funny, moving and interesting, a most worthwhile comedy drama. It won the BAFTA for Outstanding British Film of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Film and Best Original Screenplay. Very good!",

It can put you off claiming if you think you are only going to be out of work for a month or so, which is probably the intention of some people in government. So this is a worthy film to make, but the story here is heavily exaggerated. In the first half of the film every single misfortune, setback and inconvenience happens to Daniel, one after the other in a way that does not appear believe-able. He is portrayed solely as honest, warm and wholesome while the people who stand in his way are all mean, curt and heartless. Many of the characters seem artificially created or they talk in stitled dialogue to get a political message across rather than give an honest or credible account of being out of work. The film and the plot really picks up as the relationship between Daniel and Kate develops - the last 15 minutes shows how good the film could have been.",

The film just moves from one depressing scene to another and just when you think things can't get any worse for Daniel Blake they do. Whilst at the job centre Daniel strikes up a totally implausible relationship with a single mother with two children who has moved to Newcastle from London as that's the nearest housing available for her needs? She off course will do anything so her kids are feed including theft, prostitution and using the local food bank where such is her hunger she has to open a tin of beans there and then and pour into her mouth.

This film is really good, highly realistic and long, long overdue. Great Job. Nevertheless the one parent family circumstances were not realistic, unless she very naively moved to the north east for a job that fell through. In any case, with children involved, a Social worker should have put in an appearance.When he tried to sign unemployed and said his Dr. Would not certify him fit for work he would likely have been declined there too! By the time he got his Appeal he might well have been fit for work, and would then have struggled to get arrears without intervention. Yes this would be realistic!The loss of the local offices means that all he can do is attend counter receptions. 20 years ago his claim would have been determined behind reception and often by the person who interviewed him. (29 years ago as a Decision Maker myself I would sometimes see people myself. An appeal could of course be accepted back then in writing at any time after the decision).Nevertheless the courage to tackle this subject is unprecedented. The techniques used are extraordinary and the acting is excellent. I even wonder if some scenes were filmed with natural reactions from people who did not have a script, or prior knowledge of the scenes. This is apparently the case with The Food Pantry scene, and I wonder if true when he asks for help with his PC and the reactions in the street at the end. Terrific spontaneity.",

            "content": "The title emphatically states the hero's affirmation of his identity and rights. He may be the helpless object battered about by the social system but he makes himself the subject of his own story. That's why he spray-paints his cause on the bureau's outside wall \u2014 and evokes a chorus of citizen support..The heartless muscle-bound social welfare system is a fair depiction of what happens when legislation turns its back on humanity. It's the Alt Right's dream come true, the objective of the Thatcher, Harper, Bush and especially now Trump governments. One worker from the welfare office comes to Daniel's funeral, But then, she sensed his vulnerability earlier and courted criticism from her \"superior\" when she tried helping him navigate the online form-filling. Her coworkers take pride in enforcing their system's insensitivity, always buttressed by The Law. As a good Leftie, director Ken Loach does not despair at the government's inhumanity. Rather, he punctuates the official cruelty with periodic examples of individuals helping out, people being human.In addition to that clerk, the department store manager personally intervenes to negate the security officer's arrest of the shoplifter. His good deed is promptly balanced by the dubious assistance offered by that security officer, a part-time procurer. In the food bank scene Katie is treated most generously, not just with the abundant provision of supplies but by the staff's kindness when she humiliates herself by ripping open a can of fruit, desperate from hunger. Katie went hungry to feed her helper Daniel.So however bleak the situation Loach finds hope in the brotherhood of man. His neighbour and friend China may be a hustler and a slob but his offer of help is sincere. The hero's name resonates. He's another Daniel in a lion's den, struggling to survive in the jungle of savage red tape. The Blake recalls William Blake, poet of the industrially stained London and the \"mind-forged manacles\" imposed upon but accepted by the broken citizenry. While the younger Katie pieces out a meagre existence Daniel's resources steadily shrink. He loses his support payments, has to sell off his furniture, shrinking his life to a blanketed quiver. His dignity keeps him from the food bank. By the time he wins his day of appeal, and with salvation near, his heart buckles from the strain. True to the naturalistic tenor of the story, the social vision, the casting and performances, and the absence of consoling sentimental music, the film eschews the happy ending obligatory in American film. Blake's death is as purely a release as Lear's and the final condemnation of the system that privileges process over people. Here Loach's heart and head seem to operate in sync. Not so in his joining the BDS-holes who would undermine the only democracy in the Middle East, the sole guarantor of religious, political, gender and civil rights, i.e. Israel.As is common among the \"useful idiots\" on the Left, Loach responds with appropriate compassion to the suffering of the Palestinians. His error is in defining its cause. What he fails to realize is that this horrible suffering is the fault not of Israel but of the Palestinians' own elected tyrannies and their determination to waste generation after generation of their own lives in their hope to eradicate the Jews. After all, the Palestinians could have had their own prosperous, healthy and secure independent state at any time since 1922 \u2014 if they had only accepted peaceful coexistence with the Jewish state. They have persistently rejected that peace. So, when Israel withdrew from Gaza and the Palestinians had the chance to prove themselves a responsible state, they instead promoted their genocidal intention anew, firing hundreds of rockets at Israeli civilians and building invasive tunnels to attack. Supporting the Palestines against Israel only advances their abusive enslavement by their own government.",

Strangers in the library, the neighbor \"China\" trying to out scheme the brand-name schemers, and I'd add especially the woman at services office (was it Ann or Claire, I remember she had a name-tag and tried to be more than that with both water on visit and some screen access the other).Scenes at the food pantry and with the employment search definitely tough pills to swallow no matter what you think it is, but those scenes of compassion of striving to treat another with dignity, I think that's the simple message here, not easily filled out in triplicate.Anyways a fine film.",

Ken Loach is a master at this stuff, but the secret to getting on board with such tragedy is twofold - how much you relate to the subject matter, and how contrived are the situations that unfold to prove the point. The awful, heartbreaking reality of the poverty line and the injustices inherent in the failing systems that profess to be helping people is a subject I have some personal experience of and I have to say I was in pieces watching certain scenes of I, Daniel Blake. So woven through with the ring of truth it looks like it must have been easy to make. How skillfully hidden therefore is the immense talent it takes to do that!Relative newcomer Hayley Squires is a revelation. I will never forget how deeply touched I was watching the horrific simplicity of one particular scene. If you have seen it you will know which one. Too bleak and cold for me to rate this higher than 8/10, but for the type of film it is there are few better.

Ken Loach at 80 years still holds the fervor of activism of working class people struggling to meet ends. Ken narrates the apathy the bureaucratic system and processes inflict on a needy person through the eyes of two characters - One is Daniel Blake (played subtly by Dave Johns) and other is Katie Morgan (played by Hayley Squires.Due to heart-attack Daniel Blake is denied to do his current carpentry work, but is fit to do other odd jobs if he want subsistence allowance from government. There starts his battle with the job-center bureaucracy and here he meets Katie a single mother of two kids (girl - 9 years, boy - 7 years) who has newly arrived to New Castle and is late for the job-center interview. Daniel helps, supports, cares and gives emotional hand-holding for Katie to settle down comfortably. With no luck going in favor of either of them, Katie ends up doing a escort (prostitution) job, whereas Daniel ends up selling all his household belonging to survive - for getting two sets of meals for him.There is a also small sub-plot to lighten up the screen-time - of Daneil's neighbor China (Kena Sikazwe) who sells Chinese goods illegally.There are many outstanding dialogues and scenes that render your heart with mushy compassion for these characters. A note written by Daniel is read out in the end of the movie by Katie at his funeral ceremony, that sums up the core of the movie - the suffocating bureaucracy.:\"And I swear that this lovely man, had so much more to give, and that the State drove him to an early grave.\"One scene in particular needs special mention because it won the most powerful scene award for the year. It is when Katie sends her daughter to give some food to Daniel, who refuses to open the door and the girls asks him \"Dan, when you came and helped us, why can't we help you back?\" and Daniel opens the door and breaks down hugging the child. ABSOLUTELY SOUL STIRRING!There were rumors that government,might censor the movie and lots of media debates around existing pathetic government system. The movie garnered good support and appreciation from both - people and the critics respectively. It ended up doing very good business.\nThe relationship Daniel (60 years) and Katie (27 years) share is the best part of the movie. There is a huge age difference between the two, and they do not share romantic LOVE, but they LOVE each other deeply, and feel for each other emotionally. That humanity jumps out alive in their characters on screen.Director Ken Loach and writer Paul Laverty research a lot about the problems of people on government apathy towards the job seekers and felt this story that reflect so many people's lives needs to be told. It surely resonates...!(I would give the movie 7.5 out of 10)",

            "review_title": "Searing indictment of the Tory austerity measures since 2010",
            "content": "I, Daniel Blake is not easy viewing, and nor should it be. For fifty years, director Ken Loach has been making films with a finger on the pulse of modern Britain and here, in the 'twilight' of his career, he provides us with arguably his most provocative, touching and downright important film since the days of 'Kathy Come Home' first peeled back the layers of squalid British life to show the humanity of people let down by a system ignorant and uncaring of the predicaments it has itself caused.Daniel Blake is a lifelong carpenter, struck down by a serious heart condition and left to navigate the dense and seemingly obtuse benefits system apparently designed to hinder, not help him. Told he is unfit to work by his GP, Daniel is however failed on the all-works test by a 'health professional' and then pushed from pillar to post by a system that demands a sick man looks for work that isn't there, to satisfy benefit conditions he cannot hope to fulfil. The Orwellian system of online applications, claim forms and appeal hearings leaves the close to retirement Daniel perplexed and frustrated in a world of faceless bureaucracy and a digital welfare system that is as alien to him as a monkey wrench would be to a web designer.Amidst this daily grind to find common sense amongst automated applications and robotic administrators, Daniel meets Katie, a young single mum just arrived from London, and the two strike up a deep friendship based on their shared failure to fit into a world that regards them as clients and customers rather than people. Together they experience the real-life shames of food banks, shop-lifting and prostitution, as Katie skips meals to feed her kids and steals sanitary products when the measly handouts run dry. Ultimately she has little choice but turn to prostitution, trading in the only asset society has left her - her looks - and when Daniel tries to persuade her that selling herself (and her self-respect) is a step too far, their friendship is threatened, leaving Daniel destitute and without even the small amount of hope left in his increasingly perilous life.Loach's casting and direction makes the most of a superlative cast - as is his signature - and the grim and grimy streets of Newcastle are depicted with a typically documentary feel (it's often unsure whether the extras in the film are aware they are being filmed or not, which in a segment showing Daniel's arrest after he graffitis the local Jobcentre Plus chimes particularly true). It would be easy in another filmmaker's hands to be overwhelmed by the despair and helplessness that Daniel and Katie often feel, but Loach never forgets the small pieces of kindness that make a difference in even the most untenable of situations. A sympathetic Jobcentre adviser and an indulgent supermarket manager both remind us that not everyone is of the opinion that benefit claimants have brought their own troubles upon themselves, and these small but precious slices of humanity do much to keep a focus on the heart of the piece - those left behind when an unsympathetic and out of touch government see the most vulnerable as the first target when it comes to tightening the trouser belt.But as with life, I, Daniel Blake doesn't come with a neatly tied happy ending. Just as Daniel's perseverance with playing the system by its own rules seems to have won out, he suffers a fatal heart attack while in the bathroom of the very claims centre who are about to end his journey into purgatory. It's a real sucker-punch moment, delivered with alacrity as Daniel's final moments occur off-screen, leaving the emotional fallout of his death to be enacted by the panicked actions of the staff who discover him and the wailing grief of Katie, who having reconciled with Daniel had accompanied him to his review appeal.Films can make us feel sad, happy, exhilarated and shell-shocked all in the space of a couple of hours, but not often do they leave the viewer seething with anger and shaking their head at a story ripped straight from the tabloid headlines and documentary programmes of our everyday lives. Ken Loach has proved once again that, despite his advancing years, he is as unwilling to go gentle into that good night as he was when he first turned his outraged vision on Britain's underclasses half a century ago. I, Daniel Blake deserves the widest audience possible, from the strata most affected by the events it depicts to the comfortable middle-classes whose understanding stretches only so far as the Daily Mail. Five Star filmmaking on every level, and a priceless document for our uncertain, troubled times.",

Although not under exactly the same circumstances as Daniel Blake, I have experienced the frustrating bureaucracy of having to go to a Job Center and try to sort out benefits. I know that cripplingly humiliating feeling of being talked to like you are worthless and lazy even though you desperately want a job. Every time a bureaucratic DWP character mentioned 'The Decision Maker' it made me want to shout at my screen. I have heard those words in real life. I have dealt with those evil government robots. Special mention to a particular man who worked at the Chorlton, Manchester job center around 2011 who made me feel horrible and who couldn't even crack a smile and say well done when I finally did find work. Loads of people hated you mate and I'm sorry that your life was obviously so utterly devoid of happiness and love. (Sorry, i've gone off on one, its just that this film has brought back a lot of memories!)This film should be shown to all civil servants, government officials and definitely all politicians in the UK as a guide of how NOT to operate.

            "content": "According to the Nobel Prize laureate Joseph Stiglitz we live in the economically most unequal times with a class of people who are left behind and for who the social safety net is out of reach. Ken Loach latest film 'I, Daniel Blake' intends to memorialize them and their struggle to survive where they still try to keep their dignity.After suffering from a severe heart attack, the former carpenter Daniel Blake is certified as unfit for work by his doctor. Despite this, healthcare ''experts'' draw a different conclusion wherefore he does not get the benefits he need. Getting no helpful support from the public institutions Daniel only finds solidarity in the young single mother Katie who is in a similar, probably even worse situation like him. Very conspicuous is the direct and incredibly harsh story-telling: For both Daniel and Katie is almost no hope. The employees at the job center do not act like humans and do not have a spark of empathy, Katie needs to support her two children who are in very bad mental health and Daniel is imprisoned in the Kafkaesque bureaucracy of the residue of GB's welfare state. It is heartbreaking to see how they fight to keep their dignity, a fight in which Katie almost fails at one point when she decides to prostitute herself \u2013 a powerful scene! The real tragedy becomes apparent in the fact that Katie and especially Daniel, whose character is so authentic depicted by standup comedian Dave Johns, are good-hearted, reasonable and kind people. He helps Katie with his manual skills and takes care of her children while Katie wants to give her children an ordinary life. Their noble character traits are their capital. Nevertheless, this does not help them because for the system they are not individuals, but numbers or just more jobless persons. But to see only the artistic drama and tragedy in the film would underestimate its thematic bandwidth. Behind 'I, Daniel Blake' is also a strong and highly relevant political message concerning the so- called neoliberalism. An economic and political ideology which aim is to tear any state activity on the field of economy down. According to its theorists it is not the states' responsibility to help the poor. Daniel Blake as a fictitious character who is based on real people is one of the victims of this ideology which has led to cuts in the welfare state and wider rifts within society (e.g. Brexit). Thus, the people at the job center act so cold-hearted, because they are trained to do so. Thus, it is so difficult for Daniel to enter an objection in this ''survival-of-the-fittest'', where a sense of community has nearly vanished. In addition, it is certainly no coincidence that ''privatization'' is mentioned at one point. With the portrayal of a system which punishes honest people and let them almost lose everything they have, neoliberalism is the main target of the film and Loach assails how dangerous its ''lean state'' idea is. By the characters of Daniel and Katie, Loach shows this in an impressive and realistic manner. There is only one thing I would criticize concerning the storyline: The ending is a bit too predictable and exaggerated. It was obvious that this will happen if it finally looks like Daniel will win back his humanity, but I do not think that this ''twist'' was really necessary. Of course, other viewers may argue that it is a consistent and appropriate ending.To sum it up, on the one hand I highly recommend watching the film because Loach created a very well-done drama full of impressive scenes which should almost made you cry, featuring a cypress-dark main conflict (honest people vs. a destructive system). Actually, this reminded me a bit of the much darker German drama 'Woyzeck' by Georg B\u00fcchner, but that's another point. On the other hand, 'I, Daniel Blake' is a fierce and to-the-point ''call for arms'' against those whose political aim is to crush the social safety net and realize their neoliberal agenda. 9 pts.",

This faceless, bureaucratic figure is reminiscent of Kafka's castle - you can't reach him/her no matter what forms you fill in and how hard you try. For any who think this is unbelievable let me assure you it is all too true. Because of the topic the film could have been bleak but Daniel's eyes keep their glint of life and humour and above all he keeps his own kindness and humanity in stark contrast to many of the staff he deals with. I hope every staff member at Centrelink (in Oz), above all the CEO and Ministerial \"decision maker\" have to sit and watch this. In my own dealings with Centrelink some staff are lovely, helpful and as kind as the ladies in the film's wonderful food bank scene. However there are those who seem to do their best to try and make you feel inferior and who in loud voices let everyone know in the dreaded queue exactly what you are there for. You are no longer a person but a number in the system. I Daniel reveals this so well. The stand out scenes are those where Daniel tries phoning the Centre and deals with the interminable music (that was like a scene in a horror movie, it brought back such feelings of frustration and anxiety)and even though this is over the top, the scene of Daniel's spraying graffiti on the Centre's wall was so satisfying to watch. His struggles to use a computer were funny but also just so true, I've been the person on the other computer helping \"Daniels\"cope with this unfamiliar machine.

            "content": "I don't THINK their are real spoilers in this but one comment might be construed as such so I added - 'contains spoilers' even though it doesn't except in the most vague way. The comment is only that the people are more helpful than the system. This is pretty much what the film is about so I don't think it is a surprise or a spoiler but I think IMDb are wise to make us 'not spoil' a film for those that haven't seen it yet, especially in a film like this.I won't go politics but the film portrays a silly governmental system - developed over years and years, from one political party to the next as time moved on. This film is about a system, not a government.Some poor people struggle to get work or be paid their due for being out of work. Or benefits to support their kids. Other countries don't have this at all - so we're lucky in the UK. But when people pay in to a system to help themselves and family and those around them and it seems to work against the old or unskilled or supportive of others it's crazy. This the film highlights well.More than that though - it shows how the people in a community help each other more than the 'English/British' community works in the same way. The poorest sometime help the poorest the most. You wouldn't see this local bonding in, perhaps Berkshire or Chelsea (I'm generalising in a way the film doesn't, but only trying to make a point).A socially interesting film, very well acted by almost all (and in the others only 'better than well' - i.e. better than I'd say in most films from all actors - all were great), directed and filmed (location filming and cinematography was spot on for the film - I loved the small but 'just right' location shots and some of the pre-scene moments).I'd suggest a MUST watch for Brits. For others, I think would be very interesting to see what 30%+ of Britain is really like - it's not all Big Ben and James Bond - the same as USA is not all Wall Street or Boston bars, and France is not all Paris or the Dordogne.Most films I love and watch over and over are 8-9. This is an 8.5. But not a film I'll watch again. It's not that type of film. You'll understand once you see it. But you should.VERY, VERY watchable.But low 'rewatchability' - it's no action film. Just a very GOOD film :)",

Ken Loach, at the age of 80, in his recent film \"I Daniel Blake\", remind us again how the film industry with showing violence, sex, rich and powerful hero's, nonsense suspensions and Fake Stories lost the power of real cinema to reflect our painful world. Maybe If you ask the filmmakers all around the world about their goals, 90% of them answer you, that they at least want to entertain you with such bullshit elements. They know exactly something is wrong but at the end, they say that, whether one likes it or not, that's the way it is. If you want to make a film you should respect your audiences and their banal tastes. On the other hand, the audience is getting bored with the tons of movies with similar structures and overdone stories. That is why Godard said that \"The film is over.\" I believe nowadays it's not enough to avoid such mainstream elements, perhaps we should recreate a new film system with new deals.

All the online computer stuff (some of which I struggle with and I know computers). The endless forms to fill in and endless waiting on the phone is just so true to life.The whole film is simply one normal bloke trying to get employment and going through a benefit system etc that is not designed to help or make life easy.

But his story is precisely that: a state-sponsored gradual metamorphosis of \"a man\" into \"a dog\".In this brutal descent of Daniel Blake into the labyrinthine inferno of modern bureaucracy Ken Loach has shown himself to be a filmmaker of Brechtian caliber. This film is a testament that modern, progressive, and (ostensibly) humanistic capitalism can be perfectly devoid of villains yet be utterly dehumanizing to those it purports to serve.Yes! Strange, isn't it? In a story where angels have their wings trimmed and their throats slashed with efficiency and precision worthy of Josef Mengele there is no executioners; no evildoers. There are, however, those who do their job and those who, occasionally, need to be instructed on how to do better. And that's the beauty of it. Loach knows that all those people serving this system are (in their own minds) perfectly justified in sleeping well at night. After all, even if all of them create evil ends, none of them individually seem to do anything evil. Loach's project, therefore, is to use Daniel Blake as mirror to our moral complacency and its deadly consequences.But above all, his \"J'accuse\" is directed at the system in which doing the right thing becomes irrelevant (even impossible), and in which partisan politics and bottom line define who gets to be human, and who, like Joseph K's last utterance, dies \"like a dog!\".",

As an educated but proudly working class liberal, the message should resonate and move me, but the film left me with strong feelings of disappointment and lost opportunities, not about the subject but about the film. Firstly, there is a distinct reluctance to portray the central characters as ordinary working class. I can understand the reticence in perhaps following old clich\u00e9s in relation to the working class - as we are often unfairly portrayed as caricatures and overwhelmingly uneducated. However, the portrayal of the central characters as having hidden talents or aspirations of higher education are clumsy and patronising and not a little cynical. I felt the film was appealing to the affluent middle class liberal and that their affection for the characters could not be garnered without the addition of this extra potential. I would have found the story a lot more believable if the characters had been far more ordinary, who just survive without the fall-back option of bettering themselves with Open University aspirations. Also, Daniel's obvious artistic talents make it unlikely that he would need to sell his furniture to survive. My main annoyance at the film however is the broad strokes it takes with the storyline - the employees at the various government agencies are portrayed as almost universally heartless. Having experience of unemployment and dealing with these kinds of people, this is not my experience. Also, the oldest clich\u00e9 in the book, of the mother having no choice but to go into prostitution was the final straw for me. It was not a little patronising and insulting to me as a woman to portray this as a natural progression. In short, I was ready to love this film, but it is clumsy, clich\u00e9 ridden and only appeals to those having an isolated affection for the working class and does the subject matter (which deserves proper attention) no favours whatsoever.",

A well-deserved award from my perspective, because this independent film shows a reality that a major film producer would not do, and that Sixteen Films and Why Not Productions did. Such a reality is the duality of the capitalist problem that represents on the one hand the skills or experience in young people and the knowledge of new technologies in older people.\nIn my opinion it is a good production, as it shows the reality of many people in the UK, people who don't drink tea with rolls, but yes with worries.",

A lot of the film is clearly populated by non-actors and a lot of the script seems improvised.

            "content": "British director Ken Loach isn't known for politically subtle films; his stories are ones which grounded in one political worldview, promoting and expounding it from a variety of angels. That's not to say he's necessarily heavy-handed; but he runs that risk on occasions. Approaching this film, aware that it was his state of the (British) nation address from the point of view of people lost in a labyrinthine benefits system, I was expecting something I would be naturally sympathetic to but possibly alienated from due to what I expected to be broad-brush strokes. I was wrong; it's Loach's most nuanced and delicate film, telling a simple story with slowly simmering rage. A widowed man is signed off sick from work due to a heart condition; as he attempts to claim the benefits he needs he befriends a single mother and her children as they too seek the support the state should be giving them. Though the script is compelling, the real strength of the film is in its silences and counterpoints; the personal care of the food bank volunteers against the largely dispassionate, impersonal government employees. This results in the films most moving scene - a visit to a food bank where a combination of hunger and receiving compassion tip a desperate, nearly crushed woman in to an act of quiet desperation that's heartbreaking to watch. It's to the film's immense credit that it doesn't drift into anti-climax afterwards; yet neither is there a cheap, easy victory or moment of false hope. Hope is there, but it walks a vulnerable line of being extinguished by the system designed to serve the very people lost under the weight rules and regulations. It's a story of the people who fall through the cracks; it reminded me of Dickens' urgent, prophetic tales of urban poverty and never ending legal wranglings - and the film does not suffer from such lofty comparison. We're left asking: do we contribute to such systems' oppression and suffering, or do we seek out those who are lost, sit with them, listen to them, walk with them? It's a film of difficult questions and few answers; but that is moving, satisfying, funny and eloquent for all that.",

I was touched by the kindness of the people working there and angry about Katie's situation, being alone starving. It was a very heartfelt and sincere movie dealing with social issues and injustices. The performance of the actors were unbelievably accurate mainly because they actors were not professionals. Ken Loach offers another overwhelming film.

The impression of an unfair, unequal society lasts during all the movie and we keep on feeling it even after the end of I, Daniel Blake. Even if the actors play quite well, in fact it's so realistic that we almost feel like we are among them, we put ourselves in their shoes. I think it's too bad that the film could may not be attractive enough to give to younger people the desire to watch it.

But never more so than for the people least equipped to deal with it.  In this film, director Ken Loach shows us one man's (Kafka-esque) struggle in a straightforward realist way - the facts speak for themselves, no comedy allowed (despite the fact that star Dave Johns is a British comedian).  Loach's films have always championed the working class and the down-and-out and that hasn't changed here - but at age 79, he has found a way to reduce the polemics and just show the pain (and the human dignity it impinges upon).  Daniel Blake, a carpenter, has had a heart attack and his doctors forbid him from working - so he goes on what we would call \"disability\" payments here in Australia (the UK system seems similar).  But for some reason, his case is re-evaluated and he is found \"fit for work\" by a telephone assessor, a judgment which he tries to appeal by necessity, given his doctors' verdict.  While waiting for appeal, in order to keep any payments at all, he is encouraged to apply for the \"jobseeker's allowance\", which comes with an array of strings attached - 35 hours per week spent seeking work, a condescending CV workshop, and other indignities.  Blake dutifully complies (but not without some sarcastic retorts, not quite sotto voce) despite the fact that he can't really take any job he finds.  A subplot involves a young single mother (Hayley Squires), befriended by Blake, who is relocated to Newcastle (where the film takes place) for public housing but isn't given any welfare because she was late for an appointment (due to getting on the wrong bus).  Her experience seems even more calamitous and desperate than Blake's.  Loach does resort to some pretty dramatic examples to show us how the system fails ordinary people -- and how those who work within it can become hard-hearted in order to manage programs that are under-resourced, \"digital by default\", and ideological targets for right-wing politicians to cut.  A quick Google search for \"Centrelink problems\" here in Australia results immediately in the following quote from our national news desk: \"The Government knew Centrelink's debt recovery program would incorrectly tell clients they owed money if human oversight was reduced, but continued to do so in a bid to cut costs.\" Equally terrifying.  Films such as this can win sympathy (the film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes) but will the politicians listen?  Every vote counts.",

It's a powerful, anger inducing and ultimately heart breaking film that is a must see for a true insight into how our government has always treated and continues to treat the less fortunate.",

Set in Newcastle this moving film deals once again with the struggles of the working class. In this case we follow Daniel Blake, recovering from a heart attack and battling the bureaucracy to get his life back in order. Beautifully written and acted this film aches with honesty and pathos.

As winner of last year's Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, it's safe to assume that that will not be the end of this film's accolades. Director Ken Loach has an almost unmarred history of producing quality films over the last 50 years, but this emotive and honest look at poverty in the first world rivals his 1969 masterpiece \"Kes\". The film concerns the titular Daniel Blake, a widower out of work due to health issues, as he struggles against a system that slowly kills the poor through starvation, exposure, and endless bureaucracy. He befriends a single mother of two, and they try to help each other stay afloat in a society of indifference. Along the way they have chance encounters with glimmers of human kindness that help them get by for the time being. It's not too dissimilar from last year's \"A Man Called Ove\" in terms of characters and plot, but the two films diverge in focus. \"...Ove\" is more concerned with the heart and how we can distance ourselves from others due to trauma whereas \"...Blake\" is an indictment of the state for its apathetic role in the degradation of the working class. Dave Johns does an excellent job of capturing Blake as a man who refuses to give up in spite of being trapped in an endless loop of paperwork and meetings. He embodies the frustration that the working class has simmered in for the last decade since, between the housing crisis and the banking collapse, it became abundantly clear that the haves will make no caveats for the have-nots.",

This film began with a very simple pretext and characters, but ended up with a \"bang\" that brought out the stark difference between the endless hopelessness that the protagonists have to suffer throughout the film, and their heartbreaking tenacity in keeping every last pieces of their dignity, and humanity. Someone looking for a sophisticated cinematic work that was able to win the \"Palme d'Or\" over much more prominent films like \"The Salesman\" or \"Toni Erdmann\" would probably be disappointed with this film's simplicity and its repeated theme from other Ken Loach's works. But no matter how complex we are, human is actually simple at heart (literally and metaphorically), especially when facing hardships in life.

Many film experts thought it would sail through, but that did not happen. Now I saw it and I think it should have made into. If the priests' dirty secrets were recognised to condemn on such a big platform, then this film deserves as well. Because it reveals the cruelty against the economically weaker families and computer illiterate old men.\n\nIt is only this much short to be called a documentary film. I mean it was very realistic with cinematic dialogues, otherwise a documentary. This is a message film, highlights what's wrong with our system and who are all suffering from it. The actors were great and the 80 years- old director had done a magnificent job. You could watch as many films you want, but if you fail to watch a film like this often, there no meaning getting into film watching business.\n\nThe story follows a 60 year old widower whose name mentioned in the title. As he is recovering from heart attack and as advise given by his doctor, now he's out of the job and support allowance. Whenever he approaches the officials to look his issue, they always come up with different reasons to send him back disappointing. Especially not being into the computers, he struggles to fill forms on the internet platform.\n\nHe's very patience and following everything they have told him to do. One day he comes to aid to a single mother with two kids who recently moved to the city from London, when she is too struggling in the employment agency to get a job. So their relationship grows as they lend hands to one another in tough times. Following, how they recover from the issues they are facing is what the film to cover in the remaining parts.\n\n\"Listen, you know, you give me a plot of land, I can build you a house. But I've never been anywhere near a computer.\"\n\nI liked this the film, but I think it was too realistic for my kind of taste. Because I like emotional parts and in this film those parts were highly effective, but not sentimentally striking way. Maybe you can say, less music with more dramatisation changed the storytelling style. Though the focus given on economically lower class and their way of life, not intentionally, but lack of support in society, all these were well detailed. I have always supported films that point outs flaws in basic establishment in society.\n\nAlmost all the major struggling juncture one goes through in the employment agency, particularly if the person was old is uncovered. Like the telephone calls responding to the recorded message, online applications, as well as meeting them in person. What we're facing right now in the world is or to know is, not everybody is a computer literate. It'll be in the future, but not now. They are not getting proper help, particularly agency treating them like the illegal immigrants.\n\nIn addition the film gets more interesting when a single mother was introduced. On the other side, different issues faced by poverty ridden small family, particularly her desperate attempt to fulfill the basic needs of her children is heartbreaking. This is not just the English problem, but everywhere else in the world. It had won several awards, particularly one BAFTA award. A good film for everyone, only if you understand the notion of the film or else will be a boring film.\n\nWhile I was watching it, I thought it was a regular kind drama, so I kept expecting that things would turn this and that way. For almost the entire film, but it's only in the final stage something it came up with to surprise me. So my advice is keep low expectation and be patience. More importantly accept what it reveals than what you want from it. If you fail on that, then its not your film and to know that the only way is to watch it.\n\n7 1/2/10",

His doctor says that he absolutely cannot return to work as his heart's condition is far too serious. However, the British government has deemed him \"fit for work\" which means he cannot collect the British equivalent to America's Disability Insurance. Now that the government has deemed him fit for work, he must collect Job Seekers Allowance, where he must look for work at least 35 hours a week (even though he cannot work). The film gives two different points of view, one from Daniel Blake and one from Katie (Hayley Squires), a single mother of two who has recently moved out to Newcastle. Her situation is very simple, she has two kids and because she was late for her appointment due to her being lost (once again, she recently moved out to Newcastle) she has been sanctioned. This means that her Job Seekers Allowance has been frozen for 4 weeks (which she can only appeal retroactively). Daniel befriends Katie in the building where she is attempting to collect her Allowance. Daniel attempts to help the family (not financially as he has not income) but through general acts of kindness, like fixing the fuse box in their house or making things for the kids. Most people may not know what people who are forced to live on the social safety net struggle with on a daily basis and the film does an excellent job at explaining to people. As far as cinematography goes, it is spot on. There is one specific scene in a food bank that because of the great writing, acting, and camera work is one of the most stunning scenes in any film of the past decade. It is truly? heartbreaking. Acting is spot on by Dave Johns and Hayley Squires, Squires in particular truly captures the desperation on behalf of a single mother of two who must go to great lengths to put food on the table. Overall, this film is breathtaking in its telling of the stories of so many people. There are hundreds of thousands of Daniel Blake out there and hopefully, ?this exemplary film will allow them to be heard. This film should be mandatory viewing for any politician and frankly to anyone. See it!",

I challenge all so called \"professional\" critics to prove that they remotely have been through what Daniel Blake went through, No you don't know, so shut up as it's real. I on the other hand went through the same assesment by ATOS for mental health PTSD. I scored no points and was told to go back to work. I had my reassessment and scored no points again. I was desperate and put a rope around my neck. I went through with it only to be cut down in time. I had my tribunal in a court with a judge who only listened to 5 mins of what my daily life is like. He stopped the hearing and awarded me benefit for life without review. I want to work. 7 years on I have developed coping mechanisms, sometimes they fall apart. Today I volunteer to work with and help the homeless and lonely. What the film actually shows it is what I found.

            "content": "After Looking For Eric, The Angels' Share and Jimmy's Hall I think it's fair to say that Ken Loach, in his twilight years, wasn't quite as hard-hitting as the reputation that preceded him. In fact, two films inbetween these  - Route Irish and It's a Free World - where largely ignored all together. You'd have to go back to 2006 and his politically charged, Irish revolutionary drama The Wind that Shakes the Barley, to find quintessential Loach. Now though, he returns with another political drama in I, Daniel Blake and it's one of his most potent and important films. \n\nPlot: After a heart attack leaves him unable to work, widowed carpenter Daniel Blake (Dave Johns) is forced to apply for state welfare. However, the system is designed to make it difficult for him to receive any support at all. Throughout his ordeal, he befriends Katie (Hayley Squires), a single mother who finds herself in a similar situation, while trying to raise and feed her children. Together, they try to rise above the indignity of the governments extreme 'austerity' measures. \n\nIn 2014 (directly after Jimmy's Hall) Loach decided to announce his retirement from filmmaking. It was crushing news from one of the most passionate political voices in British cinema. Not to say that there isn't other talents who tackle similar projects and important social issues in film (Shane Meadows and Mike Leigh spring to mind) but there really isn't anyone quite like Ken Loach. In keeping with his socialist views - before he said farewell - he allowed all of his filmography to be available for free via YouTube. However, his retirement lasted just over a year before he stated his intent to come back and make a film on the British welfare system and the Tory government's barbaric treatment of the most vulnerable people in society. \n\nLoach obviously felt that this was a story that needed to be told. And it is. In fact, this film has been so effective that it was even raised and commented on in the Houses of Parliament, itself. Naturally, the Tory MP's lambasted it for being unfair (oh, the irony!) or for failing to accurately depict the \"decency\" of those that work with the Department of Work and Pensions - the very foot soldiers of the Govt who have been imposing such harsh penalties and sanctions on the average working class or disabled person. Methinks the Tories protest too much and, in actual fact, Loach has hit a very raw nerve. Those that work in the DWP may claim that they're only doing their job but really they're just whores of the state that are facilitating nothing less than a fascist regime. \n\n\"Work Will Set You Free\" a slogan that was once used by the Nazi's above the gates of Auschwitz. This is the very ideology of Tory Britain in our current times: Don't have a job? - Tough shit! Poverty on the rise? - Fuck That! Using foodbanks to eat? - Fuck You!... I think you get the gist. Put simply, the lower classes, the sick and the disabled are seen as parasites to a dulled-down, media-controlled society that perpetuates and excuses a fascist government. A government full of toffs that wouldn't know how to walk without a silver spoon up their arse and are blatantly happy giving tax breaks to corporations and their greedy wee cronies. \n\nSocial justice has always been a recurring theme throughout Loach's films and here his voice on the matter is ferociously loud and clear. I, Daniel Blake is a scathing indictment on the government and their complete lack of empathy towards its own citizens. \n\nAs is often the case, his films capture a raw authenticity. There's a stark reality to this that almost feels like a documentary. He has a real ability to focus on everyday people living in everyday situations. Even if you left aside the political commentary, you'd still find that Loach has crafted a genuinely touching human drama. Ultimately, this is a story about dignity, self-respect and injustice. \n\nThe film is anchored by two excellent central performances; normally known for stand-up comedy, Dave Johns as the titular character delivers solid work in his film debut but it's Hayley Squires as the single mother of two who finds herself in some devastating circumstances that truly captures your heart. For all it's unapologetic candidness, however, it also has a surprising amount of humour. To manage this, with such a bleak subject matter, only reaffirms Loach's ability to capture every aspect of life. Despite the hardships and the barbarism that people face on the lower echelons of society, there's is still a humanity that shines through. \n\nLoach has always championed the browbeaten, lower classes and his work in I, Daniel Blake (at the age of 80) shows that the fire in his soul hasn't wained a bit. Like Daniel Blake himself, he's a true voice for inequality and the dispossessed. For an understanding of how cruel our government and society has fast become, this is essential viewing. \n\nMark Walker",

Daniel Blake is browbeaten and hounded by the unnecessarily complicated job-seekers allowance application process. We feel his frustrations, not just his being messed about by the Job Centre staff, but at modern technology, which is more-or-less essential for applying. The films biggest weakness is how one-dimensionally the authoritive staff are portrayed, with the exception of the one obligatory Angel figure of course. All of them are curt, borderline rude and appear to completely ignore what our protagonist, and others in a similar situation, have to say. It does ring very true at times, but much of the movie feels more like a finger poke than a commentary. But the lead characters' plea is very real, and he's very easy to sympathise with. He never overplays, facing each obstacle with resolve and a distinctly British sense of humour. The pacing is a little slack, and the climax feels like a real Hollywood product, but the film overall is heartfelt and socially relevant, and many of its scenes are just watching Blake reacting to his seemingly deepening misery, but always with a quirk and deep determination to keep soldiering on. I'd almost call it essential viewing for its topic alone, but it has so much more than that to offer.",

            "content": "With a career spanning over 5 decades, Ken Loach is widely known for his ability to tackle social issues with unapologetic candidness; his latest feature 'I, Daniel Blake', a stark and at times harrowing depiction of one man's attempt to battle through a punitive and broken welfare system is no different. \n\nFrom the outset this Palme d'Or winning film firmly establishes the helplessness of our protagonist Daniel Blake, played by stand-up comedian Dave Johns. In the wake of a near fatal heart attack Blake is ordered to indefinitely cease working to prevent further injury and advised to sign on for social welfare years of graft as a skilled carpenter there is understandably a sense of reluctance, however the necessity of money eventually makes his trip to the dole office an unavoidable one. \n\nThe script was penned by Paul Laverty, having previously worked with Loach on his first Palme d'Or winning film 'The Wind That Shakes the Barley' depicting the Irish War of Independence. Laverty possesses a remarkable ability to find humour in otherwise distressing situations. A catch-22 situation presents itself as Daniel Blake learns he is ineligible for social welfare and, against quantitative evidence from medical professionals, deemed fit to work. Appeal against the decision and receive no benefits at all, or spend his days looking for work he cannot take in order to receive Jobseeker's Allowance. After spending decades paying into a supposed safety net system it's farcical to discover that he does not qualify for benefits. The ludicrous nature of the circumstances is only exacerbated by the emotionless government officials who seem more interested in saving money than granting it to those entitled. \n\nThe issue of humanity, or lack thereof, is prominent throughout the film. This is illustrated by the distinct contrast between the almost robotic job centre employees, and Blake's fellow victims of this red tape merry-go-round. His life becomes entangled with one such victim, Katie (Hayley Squires), after she is relocated almost 300 miles to Newcastle due to an alleged lack of social housing in her previous home, London. Their encounter is an unforgettable one as Katie learns she will be denied her benefits as a result of arriving late to the appointment. She is then further punished after explaining she accidentally took the wrong bus in an alien city by being heartlessly removed by security, and Blake, pointing out the lunacy of unfolding events, meets the same fate. The silver lining to this otherwise disheartening scene is the almost father-daughter relationship that forms.\n\nAs the pair continue to jump through their respective administrative hoops they find solace in the company of one another. Blake, in using his carpentry skills to improve the condition of Katie's new home and Katie in helping Blake navigate a 'digital by default' paperless system. Additionally, her two children receive support from a long awaited father figure as their mother plunges deeper into distress over monetary troubles without the support network of her friends and family. The crescendo of emotions reaches breaking point as she is forced to turn to a food bank in order to survive. A heart wrenching scene of pure desperation follows as the starving Katie cowers in the corner of the room devouring a tin of cold baked beans. 'Look at the state of me' she says to Blake, this is what she has been driven to.\n\nI, Daniel Blake takes many dramatic twists and turns before its inevitable climax. Loach, not one for subtlety, puts the audience through an array of emotion in what could be described as an expos\u00e9 into a broken system supposed to offer aid, not frustration and suffering. Driven out of assumed retirement to create perhaps his magnum opus, this insightful representation of real struggles is one not to be missed.",

It stars Dave Johns as Daniel Blake, who is denied employment and support allowance despite his doctor finding him unfit to work. Hayley Squires co-stars as Katie, a struggling single mother whom Daniel befriends. \n\nLet's hit the negatives before I start gushing about this movie.  There is absolutely no concept of time.  It's tough to know if a week, a month or even a year goes by from start to finish and that is a wee bit problematic.  Also, the ending is utterly predictable.  I saw it from a mile away.  Sometimes a filmmaker ties up all the loose ends unnecessarily.  Somewhere i have to imagine there was an alternate ending.\n\nLoach's attentional to detail is a thing to marvel.  He meticulously carves out a touch of life that is as authentic as it is a reminder that often we aren't doing enough for those less fortunate.  Even if you caught this in the United States, it rings true.  Unless you're filthy rich and/or have the means or the time to battle a government agency, we've all been given the runaround.  You feel the frustration of our main character Daniel Blake (Johns).  All he wants to do is work.  This work is an inspiration and will provoke various emotions. Final Score: 8.1/10",

In one scene Blake protests outside the DWP offices and daubs the building in graffiti whilst shouting obscenities about a Conservative politician.\nThe ending although again moving is entirely predictable.\nLoach is 80 or so so I should cut him some slack but this film is nowhere near as good as Kes (1969) which doesn't show his political beliefs so starkly.\nThe film follows the template of many Ken Loach films being shot on location in a northern city using comedians and television actors.

Some of the plotting might seem a bit neat but it feels no less real and never stray too close into melodramatic contrivances. And as always, his film always makes the best of new or lesser known actors. Dave Johns and Hayley Squires are naturalistic and totally believable in their respective roles, and the latter gives a particularly heart-breaking performance.

If you've ever had to deal with the benefit system you'll relate to the character's plight and how farcical the system is.\n\nAs usual, Ken Loach add his usual dose of realism to the film with the inclusion of the general public as roles in the film which adds a togetherness aspect to the film.",

But don't let that put you off. The film does not feel sorry for itself nor pretentiously tries to tug at your heartstrings. It serves up a realistic endearing story of the platonic friendship of Daniel Blake and Katie, a single Londoner mother of two children from two different fathers. The chance meeting of the two in an unemployment centre focuses on how difficult and flawed the social security benefits system is along with the callous patronising  jobsworths that work in them. People do laugh even when times are hard and from the very start of this film you'll be in stitches. The story of the human condition resonates clearly and it's hard not to love alongside strong performances from the entire cast. The film won the Palme D'or award at this years Cannes and rightly so. Not sure about the Oscars but this most certainly has thrown down the gauntlet as a strong contender for Best British film at the BAFTA's. My rating: 5 out of 5. Solid.",

Oh Kes!\" But Kes was 47 years ago and shamefully, I'm not familiar with any of his films since then. One conclusion from this realisation is that Loach has a strong reputation as a filmmaker and this was my long awaited reunion. \n\nWe follow Daniel Blake, a middle-aged carpenter who's taken a few recent knocks, one of which is suffering a heart-attack and deemed not able to return to work. It's a position no one would want to be in, forced to sacrifice your own health or lose everything you have worked so hard for. \n\nWe witness the hurdles that seem purposely put there to hinder payments, speaking from personal experience I can relate to this situation to a degree. How are people such as Daniel Blake suppose to survive, or better still, have a good life they are suppose to be able to live. \n\nIt's a harsh reality on how parts of the British system fails it's people and proof that there's no real incentive to do things by the book. Having been in a similar situation myself, skirting the unemployment line getting advise from people who have no ambitious or understanding of what I wanted to do. \n\nTaking this on a more personal level, I quit a stressful position last year in the hopes of pursuing my own dream of being an artist and writer. Having to sign agreement that I would spend a number of hours trying to find work and having to provide evidence of doing so each fortnight would grant me the universal credit that I never actually received. I actually had a good case worker, as everyplace of work has good people, but equally there are those that can't see beyond, much like what is portrayed in this story. Though, instead of supporting me in trying to be something I both enjoy and apparently good at, they attempted to find me similar stressful jobs that I left for my own sanity, wanting to place me back amongst the wolves. \n\nDave Johns is exceptional as Daniel Blake, emitting the boiling frustrations of the soul-destroying turn of events, right to the very end. Hayley Squires' Katie is short of brilliant too, displaying the tremendous pressure when faced with these kind of tribulations. Though, the acting from the rest of the supporting cast is less desirable, it's forgivable. \n\nIt's a raw, honest and emotional look at the suffering and poor way of life some unfortunate people have to contend with in Great Britain. It's compelling, invoking and upsetting, showing the great lengths and risks people go through in order to maintain their self dignity. It's certainly a film that boasts Loach's credibility. \n\nRunning Time: 8\nThe Cast: 7\nPerformance: 7\nDirection: 7\nStory: 8\nScript: 8\nCreativity: 8\nSoundtrack: 6\nJob Description: 10\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 10 for the difficult subject matter and perfect portrayal. \nWould I buy the Bluray?: yes \n\n79% 8/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",
